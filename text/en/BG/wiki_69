<text>The Rafael Python (פיתון) is a family of air-to-air missiles (AAMs) built by the Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, formerly RAFAEL Armament Development Authority. Originally starting with the &quot;Shafrir&quot; (, loosely translated as a dome, or a protective cloak – but also similar sounding to Dragonfly, a male form of inflection for Damselfly (שפירית)) series, the &quot;Shafrir-1&quot; missile was developed in 1959, followed by the &quot;Shafrir-2&quot; in early 1970s. Subsequently, the missiles were given the western name of &quot;Python&quot; by the parent company for export purposes, starting with the &quot;Python-3&quot; in 1978. Since then, it has been further developed and evolved into the &quot;Python-4&quot;, &quot;Python-5&quot;, &quot;Derby&quot; and also, the SPYDER, an advanced ground-based air-defence system. Currently, the missiles are in service with the armed forces of over fifteen countries from around the world.

==Design and development==
In the 1950s, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) submitted requirements for a domestically made air-to-air missile, to promote domestic defense industry and reduce reliance on imports. Rafael Armament Development Authority was contracted to develop the &quot;Shafrir&quot; (, loosely translated as Dragonfly, a male form of inflection for Damselfly, שפרירית) in 1959. The missile entered operational status with Israeli Mirage jets in 1963, but the IAF was unhappy with its performance and no air combat kills were achieved with it during the Six-Day War, kills being made with guns instead. The improved Shafrir-2 was soon introduced in 1971, and it proved to be one of the most successful air-to-air missiles ever made. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the IAF launched 176 Shafrir-2 missiles, destroying 89 enemy aircraft. The Shafrir-2 was exported along with Israeli-made aircraft to South American countries.

After the Shafrir-2, the new missiles made by Rafael were given the western name of Python. This is why the next missile built by Rafael in early 1970s was named Python-3, but there is no Python-1 or Python-2 (they were Shafrir-1, Shafrir-2). The Python-3 has improved range and all-aspect attack ability, it proved itself before and during the 1982 Lebanon War, destroying 35 enemy aircraft. The People&#x27;s Republic of China was impressed with its performance and license-built the Python-3 as the PiLi-8 (PL-8) AAM.

Further improvements to the Python-3 led to the development of Python-4 in mid-1980s, which added the option for helmet-sight guidance. In the 1990s Rafael started development on the Python-5 AAM, which was equipped with an advanced electro-optical imaging seeker with lock-on after-launch ability. The new missile was show-cased in 2003 Paris Air Show, and intended for service with IAF the F-15I Ra&#x27;am (&quot;Thunder&quot;) and the F-16I Sufa (&quot;Storm&quot;).

The Python-5 is said to have full sphere launch ability or is an all-aspect missile, meaning it can be launched at a target regardless of the target&#x27;s location relative to the direction of the launching aircraft. It can lock onto targets after launch, even when they are up to 100 degrees off the boresight of the launching aircraft.

==Variants==
===Shafrir-1===
The Shafrir-1 was developed in 1959–1964 to fulfill IAF&#x27;s requirement for a domestic air-to-air missile. It was intended to build the domestic defense industry&#x27;s abilities, and reduce reliance on foreign imports. The fear of foreign dependence was later proven when France banned arms export to Israel.

The Shafrir-1 was intended for use on French-built Mirage III jets. The first testing took place in France in 1963. However the missile&#x27;s performance was so poor that work immediately started on the next improved version, the Shafrir-2.

===Python-3===
The Python-3 is a much-improved AAM with all-aspect attack ability, higher speed, range, and performance. It performed well before and during the 1982 Lebanon War, scoring 35 (other sources claim 50) kills.

China&#x27;s PLAAF was quite impressed with this missile, and paid for licensed production as the PL-8 AAM in the 1980s. The program code named &quot;Number 8 Project&quot; (八号工程) and formally started on September 15, 1983. From March 1988 to April 1989, technology transfer to China was complete while license assembly and license built parts continued, and by the spring of 1989, the complete domestic Chinese built missile received state certification. The major supplier of the missile was Xi&#x27;an Eastern Machinery Factory (西安东方机械厂) located at Xi&#x27;an, and China is also reported to have developed a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system for the PL-8.

===Python-4===
The Python-4 is a 4th generation AAM with all-aspect attack ability, and integration with a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system. It entered service in the 1990s, and like its predecessor Python-3, it is integrated with the Elbit Systems DASH (Display And Sight Helmet) HMS system for Israeli F-15s and F-16s, Chilean F-16s (MLU and C/D block 50/52 plus), F-5E/F Tiger III, South American Kfirs and the SAAB JAS 39 Gripen. The missile&#x27;s seeker is reported to use dual band technology array similar to that of US FIM-92 Stinger (infrared homing and ultraviolet), with IRCCM (IR ECCM) ability to reduce background IR radiation to reduce the effectiveness of enemy flares.

===Python-5===
The Python-5 is currently the most capable visual range air-to-air missile in Israel&#x27;s inventory. As a short range air-to-air missiles, it is capable of &quot;lock-on after launch&quot; (LOAL), and has full-sphere/all-direction (including rearward) attack ability. The missile features an advanced seeker which includes an electro-optical and imaging infrared homing seeker which scans the target area for hostile aircraft, then locks-on for terminal chase, and a complex design utilizing a total of eighteen aerodynamic surfaces. The Python-5 was first used in combat during the 2006 Lebanon War, when it was used by F-16 Fighting Falcons to destroy two Iranian-made Ababil UAVs used by the Hezbollah.
On 13 May 2021, an Israeli F-16 shot down a Hamas operated Shehab suicide drone with a Python-5 air-to-air missile.

==Other Python developments==
===Derby===
Also known as the Alto, the Derby missile is a BVR, medium-range (~) active radar homing missile. Though technically not part of the &quot;Python&quot; family, the missile is an enlarged version of the Python-4 with an active-radar seeker.

====I-Derby ER====
In June 2015, Rafael confirmed the existence of the I-Derby-ER, an extended range version of the Derby that increases range to , after a &quot;Python 6&quot; version based on an air-launched Stunner missile was abandoned. To achieve greater range, a dual-pulse solid rocket motor is added, where the secondary pulse of energy as the missile nears the target extends flight time. It also combines the seeker and fuse into an integrated sensor and fusing system to make room for the new motor.

In May 2019, it was reported that India was planning to arm its Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighters with I-Derby ER missiles to replace its R-77 missiles. Previously, in 2018, it had already been selected for the Indian Air Force&#x27;s HAL Tejas fighter.

===SPYDER===

The SPYDER (Surface-to-air PYthon and DERby) is an advanced ground-based anti-aircraft missile system developed by Rafael that uses surface-to-air versions of the Python-5 and Derby missiles.

The territory that today is the department was inhabited by the Maya-Chortis civilization in the west and north; and Lenca in the extreme south. Its name &quot;Copán&quot; is due to the chief Copán Galel, a warrior who defended his lands before the Spanish colonization. This territory was within the jurisdiction of the colonial city of Gracias a Dios and until May 28, 1869, it was within the jurisdiction of the department of Lempira. On that date it was officially created as the Department of Copán and the city of Santa Rosa de Copán was named as the capital, during the administration of Captain General Don José María Medina. 

== Economy ==

The Department of Copán is a geographically mountainous area, its main source of income is tourism to the Mayan archaeological sites, followed by the cultivation and production of coffee, tobacco, livestock, agriculture of vegetables and basic grains, production of articles in leather or saddlery, industrial products, etc.

<text>Tarkus is the second studio album by English progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, released on 4 June 1971 on Island Records. Following their debut tour across Europe during the second half of 1970, the group paused touring commitments in January 1971 to record a new album at Advision Studios in London. Greg Lake produced the album with Eddy Offord as engineer.

Side one features the 20-minute conceptual title track written by keyboardist Keith Emerson, the opening of which created friction between Lake and Emerson that almost split the group, but Lake agreed to pursue it and contributed musical ideas for it and wrote the lyrics. Side two features a collection of unrelated tracks of different styles. The artwork was designed by William Neal.

&quot;Tarkus&quot; went to number one on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the only album by the band to do so. It was a top 10 album worldwide, including the US, where it peaked at number 9. The album reached gold certification in the UK and US, the latter for 500,000 copies sold. It has been reissued and remastered several times, including a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound edition by Steven Wilson, with bonus and previously unreleased tracks from the original sessions, released in 2012.

==Background and recording==
After their debut live gigs in August 1970, the band toured across the UK and Europe for the rest of the year, during which their debut album, &quot;Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&quot;, was released. While on tour, Emerson found that he and drummer Carl Palmer were exploring more complex rhythmic ideas. He took patterns that Palmer was playing on his practise drum pads and found that they complemented runs that he had developed on the piano, and used this as a basis for material on &quot;Tarkus&quot;. The group approached the album by having a centrepiece track in order to establish a concept, but a definite story or idea for it had not been discussed at this stage.

The group paused touring commitments in December 1970 and set the following month aside to record. As with their debut, the band recorded at Advision Studios in London with Lake handling the production duties and Eddy Offord returning as engineer. Early into the sessions Emerson presented the basis of the title track to Lake and Palmer; Lake was less than enthusiastic with its direction and threatened to leave the group. A subsequent meeting amongst the band and their management convinced Lake to stay, and he went on to contribute to the track and most of the other songs on the album including the lyrics, for which he used the artwork as inspiration. Although Lake thought the opening was &quot;too demonstrative&quot; for the sake of being clever, he did not want to split the group over such an issue and got into the album as recording went on. The band could only work out &quot;Tarkus&quot; during the January 1971 studio sessions, so they booked further time at Adivsion in February to work on side two, for which they had no material prepared.

==Songs==
===Side one===
Side one is occupied by the 20-minute title track which has seven sections. It was written by Emerson, with Lake credited for &quot;Battlefield&quot; and contributions to &quot;Stones of Years&quot; and &quot;Mass&quot;. It is a conceptual piece in which its narrative remains ambiguous and open to interpretation, but the artwork depicts the Tarkus character in the form of an armadillo tank hybrid who is born and loses a fight with a manticore, which concludes with the appearance of an aquatic version of Tarkus named Aquatarkus. Lake said the song is about &quot;the futility of conflict, expressed in this context in terms of soldiers and war — but it&#x27;s broader than that. The words are about revolution, the revolution that&#x27;s gone, that has happened. Where has it got anybody? Nowhere.&quot; He added that the songs concern &quot;the hypocrisy of it all&quot; and the closing march &quot;a joke&quot;.

Emerson wrote the first musical ideas for &quot;Tarkus&quot; from a 10/8 rhythm that Palmer had played on his practice drum pad backstage at a gig. He composed the entire piece in six days on his upright piano at his London apartment, and wrote the score on manuscript. After the band rehearsed it for six days, they put it to tape; Emerson said once Lake and Palmer had mastered the 5/4 and 10/8 rhythms, &quot;everything else flowed.&quot; Emerson transposed &quot;a fleeting run of one bar&quot; from the Allegro of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 to bridge a transition between two parts of &quot;Eruption&quot;. The section is played in a 5/4 time signature which was a &quot;frustrating&quot; meter for Lake to play. Emerson wanted the &quot;Aquatarkus&quot; section to have a sound that resembled a snorkel tube as he was into scuba diving at the time, so he generated one from his Moog synthesizer and played it during the marching beat. The group would not record a longer track in the studio until 1973, with the 29-minute &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot;.

===Side two===
Side two features six songs unrelated to the conceptual title track. &quot;Jeremy Bender&quot; is a rendition of the Stephen Foster song &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot; and Emerson&#x27;s performance was influenced by Floyd Cramer, one of his favourite pianists. It came about when Emerson was playing the song&#x27;s chord progressions on a honky-tonk piano and incorporated some fifth-root chords, which the band liked. The closing features handclaps from Emerson and Palmer. &quot;Bitches Crystal&quot; originated from the idea of playing a boogie-woogie part in a 6/8 time signature, with Emerson naming Dave Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; as an influence to his playing on it. The band had a firm idea on the direction of the track early on, although some parts were difficult for the group to put down. Lake was not a fan of Brubeck as Emerson was, but Palmer was into Brubeck&#x27;s drummer Joe Morello and Emerson noticed his style of drumming in Palmer&#x27;s performance.

&quot;The Only Way (Hymn)&quot; contains themes from Toccata and Fugue in F major, BWV 540 and Prelude and Fugue VI, BWV 851 by Bach, and features Emerson on the pipe organ at St Mark&#x27;s church in Finchley, north London which was put down using a mobile recording facility. Lake wrote the lyrics after the music was recorded; Emerson and Palmer considered the religious implication in the line: &quot;Can you believe God makes you breathe, why did he lose six million Jews?&quot; was a bit too strong, but they went along with it. &quot;Infinite Space (Conclusion)&quot; features Emerson playing a 7-ft Bechstein grand piano, and came about from the band&#x27;s decision to follow the profound lyrics on &quot;The Only Way&quot; with a laid-back piece.

Emerson said Led Zeppelin were a loose inspiration for &quot;A Time and a Place&quot;, and was listening to the band a lot at the time. He recalled the track being put down in about three takes. Although not credited, the music to &quot;Are You Ready, Eddy?&quot; was largely inspired by Bobby Troup&#x27;s 1956 song &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;. Its title was a phrase the band yelled out to Offord when they were ready to record. Palmer is heard saying &quot;They&#x27;ve only go&#x27; &#x27;am or cheese!&quot;, which is what an elderly lady at Advision said to the band when they sent her round to a nearby sandwich shop and announce what they had available. Emerson said Palmer could mimic her mix of Greek and cockney accents &quot;wonderfully&quot;, and recalled the confusion from some American fans who could not understand what it was about. The track was &quot;an impromptu jam&quot; and a one-off take, and played in celebration of completing work on &quot;Tarkus&quot;.

One track left as an outtake was Lake&#x27;s &quot;Oh My Father&quot;, an autobiographical ballad dealing with grief over the recent death of his father. Featuring layers of acoustic guitars, piano, and a wah-wah guitar solo it might have balanced the keyboard-heavy tracks on the album but Lake ultimately thought it was too personal for release; it was eventually included on the 2012 deluxe reissue. Another outtake unearthed for the reissue, &quot;Unknown Ballad&quot;, was a song actually titled &quot;Just A Dream&quot; recorded during the sessions when Emerson and Palmer were out of the studio, featuring Lake on piano and his friend Gary Margetts (of the group Spontaneous Combustion) on lead vocal, with brother Tris Margetts on bass and Lake helping out on backing harmonies.

==Artwork and title==

The album was packaged in a gatefold sleeve and features artwork by Scottish artist William Neal, whose armadillo has since become an iconic image in progressive rock. Neal was involved with the London-based CCS Associates which typically produced art for reggae albums but occasionally they were given other records to work on, which was the case with &quot;Tarkus&quot;. When the band rejected the designs already completed, Neal recalled: &quot;On one of my drawings, there was a small doodle at the bottom of the page. This was of an armadillo with tank tracks on it but it was just an idea that wasn&#x27;t really going anywhere.&quot; It originated from one of Neal&#x27;s initial designs of a machine gun with a belt of bullets replaced by a row of keyboard keys, which he inadvertently sketched on with a pencil during a phone conversation which produced the tank image. Emerson liked it and suggested it be developed &quot;into more of a cartoon story&quot;, as by which point he had written &quot;Tarkus&quot; and thought the music fit with the imagery. Neal was given a copy of the album to listen to while he completed the final cover, which inspired the other drawings. The gatefold presents eleven panels that illustrate the events of the title track, beginning with an erupting volcano, below which Tarkus emerges from an egg. Tarkus then faces a number of cybernetic creatures, culminating in the battle against the manticore which stings Tarkus&#x27;s eye, and Tarkus retreats bleeding into a river.

Emerson went away with Neal&#x27;s designs and began to think of album titles. &quot;To everyone, it represented what we were doing in that studio. The next day on my drive up from Sussex the imagery of the armadillo kept hitting me. It had to have a name. Something guttural. It had to begin with the letter &#x27;T&#x27; and end with a flourish&quot;. Emerson acknowledged that Tarka of &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot; may have been an inspiration, &quot;but this armadillo needed a science fiction kind of name that represented Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution in reverse. Some of the species caused by radiation&quot;, at which point he came up with &quot;Tarkus&quot;. The &quot;Tarkus&quot; on the front cover is made from whitened bones from the skeleton of a devoured lizard.

==Release==
&quot;Tarkus&quot; was released on 4 June 1971 in the UK on Island Records, appearing two months later in the US by Atlantic Records&#x27; subsidiary label Cotillion Records. It is one of only two ELP studio albums to reach the Top 10 in the United States, making it to (&quot;Trilogy&quot;, the following year, got to ), while in Britain it is their only number-one album. Additionally, &quot;Tarkus&quot; spent a total of 17 weeks in the UK Albums Chart. In Japan the album was released on Atlantic Records. Later vinyl reissues were on the Manticore label.

&quot;Tarkus&quot; was certified gold in the United States shortly after its release on 26 August 1971.

==Reception==

Although it is now considered a quintessential progressive rock album, &quot;Tarkus&quot; received generally unfavorable reviews from critics upon its release. &quot;New Musical Express&quot;&#x27;s Richard Green, who had given high praise to the band&#x27;s debut, bemoaned that &quot;there are some nice passages, but these are almost completely buried by the overall cacophonous ostentation.&quot; In America, David Lebin in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;Tarkus records the failure of three performers to become creators. Regardless of how fast and how many styles they can play. Emerson, Lake and Palmer will continue turning out mediocrity like Tarkus until they discover what, if anything, it is that they must say on their own and for themselves.&quot; On the other hand, Chris Welch at &quot;Melody Maker&quot; heaped praise, describing the title suite as &quot;dramatic, probing, explosive, full of theatre and convincing grandeur.&quot;

François Couture, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, said that &quot;Tarkus&quot; is &quot;a very solid album, especially to the ears of prog rock fans – no Greg Lake acoustic ballads, no lengthy jazz interludes&quot;. Couture concluded, &quot;More accomplished than the trio&#x27;s first album, but not quite as polished as &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;, &quot;Tarkus&quot; is nevertheless a must-have.&quot; Paul Stump&#x27;s 1997 &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot; praised the album&#x27;s title track but criticized the &quot;enervatingly portentous lyrics&quot; and the traditional form of the solos (beginning and ending on downbeats, using blues voicings). He also said the two comedy songs (&quot;Jeremy Bender&quot; and &quot;Are you Ready Eddie?&quot;) &quot;have aged embarrassingly.&quot;

Emerson said that &quot;Tarkus&quot; was one of his favourite albums, &quot;not least because the title track has taken on a life of its own&quot;.

In 2015, Sean Murphy of &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked &quot;Tarkus&quot; the 21st best classic progressive rock album of all time.

==Reissues==
In 1993, the album was digitally remastered by Joseph M. Palmaccio and released by Victory Music in Europe and Rhino Records in North America. This was followed by two remasters by the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab in 1994 that are currently out of print.

In August 2012, &quot;Tarkus&quot; was reissued by Sony Music and released in a 3 CD pack, containing a stereo mix from the Palmaccio master, a stereo mix in the form of an alternate version of the album, and a 5.1 surround sound mix by Steven Wilson. The set also contains previously unreleased tracks recorded during the sessions.

&quot;Tarkus&quot; was reissued on record as a 12&quot; picture disc by BMG as part of Record Store Day on 12 June 2021.

<doc id="317758" wikidata="Q14710977" url="?curid=317758" title="Longhorn Dam">
<text>Longhorn Dam is a dam crossing the Colorado River in Austin, Texas, United States, where it creates Lady Bird Lake. Completed in 1960, the dam was built by the City of Austin as the last in a chain of Colorado River dams in central Texas begun during the Great Depression. The name refers to its location on a ford used for longhorn cattle drives as a part of the Chisholm Trail in the late 19th century.

==History==
Longhorn Dam was constructed in the late 1950s to establish a cooling reservoir for Austin&#x27;s Holly Street Power Plant, a 570-megawatt natural gas and fuel oil-fired electrical power plant. The reservoir it created, Lady Bird Lake, was also originally used as a source of drinking water for the city. It is not a hydroelectric dam and generates no electrical power.

In 2007 the power plant was decommissioned and subsequently demolished to make way for a new lakeside urban park; today the reservoir&#x27;s major uses are recreation and fishing. The stabilization of the downtown shoreline that the dam afforded enabled substantial parkland development along the newly created lake, including Auditorium Shores and other parts of Town Lake Park.

In the 2000s and 2010s the aging dam&#x27;s floodgates experienced a series of malfunctions, causing on some occasions the loss of substantial amounts of water down the river (when gates failed to close properly).

The dam was originally constructed and operated by Austin Energy, the city power utility, but Austin Water took over operations of the dam in April 2018.

Since 2013, Austin Energy made several maintenance and upkeep projects to the dam such as replacing all major parts and rebuilding both hydraulic bascule systems. Austin Energy also repaired one of the gates and overhauled the mechanical lifting system.

City officials have estimated the cost of replacing the dam in the tens of millions of dollars.

Between 2013 and 2018, Austin Energy spent $1.6 million in maintenance and repair costs.

==Geography and hydrography==
Longhorn Dam is located at 30.2504°, -97.7135° (WGS 84 datum), with a full water level at above sea level. The reservoir impoundment length is , creating Lady Bird Lake (formerly called Town Lake), a freshwater lake with a surface area of . Water release through the dam varies with rainfall and with the seasonal demand for irrigation water downstream.

==Structure and function==
The dam stands high and runs a length of across the Colorado River. It includes nine floodgates that are used to control water release and maintain a stable water level in the reservoir. Two are bascule gates that passively allow water to flow through to maintain Lady Bird Lake&#x27;s water level; the other seven are lift gates that are controlled manually to adjust water flow in response to weather conditions and water releases for downstream ecology and irrigation.

<doc id="317760" wikidata="Q342392" url="?curid=317760" title="Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros">
<text>Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros,  (1436 – 8 November 1517) was a Spanish cardinal, religious figure, and . Starting from humble beginnings he rose to the heights of power, becoming a religious reformer, twice regent of Spain, Cardinal, Grand Inquisitor, promoter of the Crusades in North Africa, and founder of the Alcalá University. Among his intellectual accomplishments during the Renaissance in Spain, he is best known for funding the Complutensian Polyglot Bible, the first polyglot version of the entire Bible, which was Mass produced using Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press. He also edited and published the first printed editions of the missal (in 1500) and the breviary (in 1502) of the Mozarabic Rite, and established a chapel with a college of thirteen priests to celebrate the Mozarabic Liturgy of the Hours and Eucharist each day in the Toledo Cathedral.

Cardinal Cisneros&#x27; life coincided with, and greatly influenced, a dynamic period in the history of Spain during the reign of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. During this time Spain underwent many significant changes, leading it into its prominent role in the Spanish Golden Age (1500–1700). Modern historian John Elliott said as far as any particular policies that can be attributed to Spain&#x27;s rise, they were those of King Ferdinand and Cardinal Cisneros.

==Rise to power==
He was born Gonzalo Jiménez de Cisneros in Torrelaguna in Castile in 1436, the son of &quot;hidalgos&quot; Alfonso Jiménez de Cisneros and wife María de la Torre, from the villa of Cisneros, Palencia. He studied in the Studium generale at Alcalá de Henares and also at Salamanca, where in 1456 he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law. In 1459 he traveled to Rome to work as a consistorial advocate, where he attracted the notice of Pope Pius II. He returned to Spain in 1465 carrying an &quot;executive&quot; letter from the Pope giving him possession of the first vacant benefice. That turned out to be Uceda. However, Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña, the Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain, refused to accept the letter, wishing instead to bestow the benefice upon one of his own followers. When Cisneros insisted, he was thrown in prison, first at Uceda and afterwards in the fortress of Santorcaz. For six years, Cisneros held out for his claim, free to leave at any time if he would give it up, but at length in 1480 Carrillo relented at Cisneros&#x27; strength of conviction and gave him a benefice. Fearing further reprisals, Cisneros traded it almost at once for a chaplaincy at Sigüenza, under Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza, the bishop of Sigüenza, who shortly after appointed him vicar general of his diocese.

At Sigüenza, Cisneros won praise for his work and he seemed to be on the sure road to success among the secular clergy, when in 1484 at the late age of forty-eight he abruptly decided to become a Franciscan friar. Giving up all his worldly belongings, and changing his baptismal name, Gonzalo, for that of Francisco, he entered the Franciscan friary of &quot;San Juan de los Reyes&quot;, recently founded by Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile at Toledo. Not content with the normal lack of comforts for a friar, he voluntarily slept on the bare ground, wore a cilice, doubled his fasts, and generally denied himself with enthusiasm; indeed throughout his whole life, even when at the height of power, his private life was rigorously ascetic.

He retired to the isolated friary of &quot;Our Lady of Castañar&quot; and built a rough hut in the neighboring woods, in which he lived at times as an anchorite, and later became guardian of a friary at Salzeda. Meanwhile, Mendoza (now Archbishop of Toledo) had not forgotten him, and in 1492 recommended him to Isabella as her confessor. Jiménez accepted the position on condition that he might still live in his community and follow the religious life, only appearing at court when sent for. The post was politically important, for Isabella took counsel from her confessor not only in religious affairs but also matters of state. Isabella&#x27;s Alhambra Decree, which expelled the Jews from Spain, followed almost immediately upon Cisneros&#x27; appointment as her confessor. Cisneros&#x27; severe sanctity soon won him considerable influence over Isabella, and in 1494 he was appointed Minister Provincial of the order for Spain.

Cardinal Mendoza died in 1495, and Isabella had secretly procured a papal bull nominating Cisneros to Mendoza&#x27;s Archdiocese of Toledo, the richest and most powerful in Spain. With this office was also given the office of chancellor of Castile. Isabella tried to surprise him by presenting the bull as a gift in person, but Cisneros did not react as she had hoped. Instead, he fled her presence, and ran away, only to be overtaken by Isabella&#x27;s messengers several miles outside of Madrid and convinced to return to court for further discussion. Cisneros resisted the appointment for six months and reluctantly agreed only after a second papal bull ordered him to accept. Despite his lavish new position, Cisneros personally still maintained a simple life; although a message from Rome required him to live in a style befitting his rank, the outward pomp only concealed his private asceticism.

==Reform, revolt, and crusade==
From his new position Cisneros set about reforming the Franciscan order in Spain. The ordained friars had to become celibate, giving up the practice of concubinage. They had to reside in the parish where they were supposed to work, attend confession, and preach every Sunday. There was intense opposition. By 1498 the reforms were expanded to include not only Franciscans but other mendicant orders as well. The Minister General of the order himself came from Rome to attempt to temper the archbishop&#x27;s strict reforms, but Cisneros, backed by the influence of a strong Queen, managed to impose them.

In 1499 Cisneros accompanied the court of the Spanish Inquisition to Granada, and there interfered with Hernando de Talavera&#x27;s efforts to peacefully convert its Muslim inhabitants to Christianity. Talavera favored slow conversion by explaining to the Moors, in their language, the truths of the Catholic religion, but Cisneros said that this was &quot;giving pearls to pigs&quot;, and proceeded with forced mass conversion. He ordered the public burning of all Arabic manuscripts that could be found in Granada — 5,000 is the lowest figure the contemporary sources give — except those dealing with medicine.

The indignation of the unconverted &quot;Mudéjares&quot; (i.e., Iberian Muslims living in Christian territories) over this gross violation of the Alhambra treaty swelled into the open revolt known as the First Rebellion of the Alpujarras. The revolt was violently suppressed and they were given a choice — contrary to the terms of Granada&#x27;s surrender — of baptism or exile. The majority accepted baptism and by 1500 Cisneros reported that &quot;there is now no one in the city who is not a Christian, and all the mosques are churches&quot;. However, he had created a problem that would only end with the expulsion from Spain of &quot;Moriscos&quot; in 1609.

On 26 November 1504 Isabella died. Ferdinand claimed regency against his son-in-law Philip I of Castile, and Cisneros helped mediate the dispute in the Treaty of Villafafila which left Philip as king of Castile. When Philip died in 1506, Ferdinand was in Naples and Cisneros set up a regent government in his absence, and stopped a plot by a group of high nobles to take over the throne. In return for his loyalty, Ferdinand made Cisneros Grand Inquisitor for Castile and León in 1507 and prevailed on the Pope to give him a Cardinal&#x27;s hat.

The next great event in the cardinal&#x27;s life was the attack against the Moorish city of Oran in North Africa, in which his religious zeal coincided with Ferdinand&#x27;s prospect for political and material gain. A preliminary expedition, equipped at Cisneros&#x27; expense, captured the port of Mers El Kébir in 1505. In 1509, a strong force accompanied by the cardinal in person set sail for Africa, and in one day the wealthy city was taken by storm. Cisneros returned to Spain and attempted to recover from Ferdinand the expenses of the expedition, but Ferdinand was content with taking Oran and because of his greater interest in Italy he would not support Cisneros&#x27; plans for a larger North African crusade and conquest.

==Final years==
On 23 January 1516 Ferdinand died, leaving Cisneros as regent of Castile for Charles (afterward Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor), then a youth of sixteen in the Netherlands. Though Cisneros at once took firm hold of the reins of government, and ruled in a determined and even autocratic manner, the turbulent Castilian nobility and the jealous intriguing Flemish councilors for Charles combined to render Cisneros&#x27; position peculiarly difficult. Cisneros acceded to Charles&#x27; desire to be proclaimed king; he secured the person of Charles&#x27; younger brother Ferdinand (afterward Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor); he fixed the seat of the courts at Madrid; and he established a standing army by drilling the citizens of the major towns. During his regency, he dealt with the Spanish conquest of Navarre. He is remembered for ordering the demolition of most of the fortresses of Navarre (e.g., the Castle of Xavier, home to Francis Xavier&#x27;s family) aimed at dampening any spirits of resistance and thwarting future rebellions against Spanish occupation.

In September 1517, Charles landed in Asturias on the northern coast of Spain. He arranged to meet with Cisneros in Valladolid and receive a briefing on the situation in his Spanish kingdoms. While making preparations for the meeting, Cisneros fell ill. He was still weak from illness when he began his journey to Valladolid and only made it as far as Aranda when his weakness and rumors of the plague forced him to seek shelter in the Monastery of Aguilera. Cisneros never recovered. In early November Charles sent a note thanking him for his services and giving him leave to retire. It is not clear whether Cisneros ever received the letter. He died on 8 November 1517 at Roa.

==Influence==

Cardinal Cisneros was a bold and determined statesman. Described as stern, fanatical and inflexible even by the harsh standards of his time, with a confidence that became at times overbearing, he carried through what he had decided to be right, with little regard for the convenience of others or for himself. He was seen as incorruptible, and founded and maintained numerous benevolent institutions in his diocese. His whole life was devoted either to the state or to religion; and his only recreation was in theological or scholastic discussion.

The university at Alcalá de Henares was founded in 1500 and opened in 1508. The university, raised at the sole expense of and fostered by Cardinal Cisneros, attained a great reputation. At one time 7,000 students met within its walls. All the religious orders in Spain, except the Benedictines and Hieronymites, established houses at Alcalá in connection with it. In 1836 the university, with falling enrollments and in some disarray, was moved to Madrid, renamed the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (&quot;Complutense&quot; means &quot;from Alcalá&quot;, whose Latin name is Complutum), and the buildings in Alcalá de Henares were left vacant until the creation of the modern University of Alcalá de Henares in 1977.

Cisneros published religious treatises by himself and others. He also revived the Mozarabic liturgy, and endowed a chapel in Toledo where it was to be used.

He is well known for his sponsorship of the &quot;Complutensian Polyglot&quot;, the first printed polyglot translation of the Bible, in which three different versions of the Old Testament were put in parallel columns – Greek, Latin, and Hebrew – with the Aramaic text of Targum Onkelos and its own Latin translation added at the bottom, so that readers for the first time could check all the translations simultaneously. The New Testament consisted of parallel columns of Greek and the Latin Vulgate. The text occupies five volumes, and a sixth contains a Hebrew lexicon, etc. The work commenced in 1502. The New Testament was finished in January 1514, and the whole in April 1517. The book was dedicated to Pope Leo X. Cisneros died months after it was completed and did not live to see it published.

In 1884, Spanish colonists commemorated Cisneros by founding Villa Cisneros, now Dakhla, Western Sahara.

===Veneration===

A cause for Cisneros&#x27;s beatification was formally opened on 15 October 1669, granting him the title of Servant of God. His spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 1 March 1681. He was later granted the title of Venerable.

==In fiction==

He regularly appeared as a character in Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus as leader of the Spanish Inquisition.

Unlike some of its immediate neighbors in the Texas Highland Lakes reservoir system, Lake Marble Falls is not infested with hydrilla, a non-native invasive plant from Asia thought to have been introduced to the U.S. via the tropical fish industry. Lake Marble Falls has been stocked with several species of native fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Inks Lake include largemouth bass, catfish, and sunfish. Lake Marble Falls boasts being in the &quot;top 50&quot; as far as Record Stripers Striped Bass in the Texas freshwater fish records. http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/fishboat/fish/programs/fishrecords/freshwater/top50_striped.phtml

=== Invasive Species ===
Zebra mussels are an invasive species that are able to attach themselves to boats and can be spread through anthropogenic sources. Lake Marble Falls is one of two lakes in the San Gabriel River Basin that is found to have this infestation.

==Recreational uses==

Most of the property bordering Lake Marble Falls is privately owned. Fishing and boating are popular recreational activities, including the annual Lake Marble Falls Lakefest drag boat races.

<text>Michel Baudier (c. 15891645), French historian, was born in Languedoc, during the reign of Louis XIII, and was historiographer to the Court of France.

==Life==
In the 1620s Baudier, a soldier turned historian wrote a treatise on Islam, which was one of the first works in French on Islam. His writings initially focused on administrative and military history. similarly, his historical writing about Asia was the first in France. “French admiration for the Ottomans and their military superiority, as Ina claims, manifested in Baudier &#x27;s historical writings.

He contributed to French history by writing &quot;Histoire de la guerre de Flandre 1559–1609&quot; (&quot;History of the war in Flanders 1559–1609&quot;, Paris, 1615); &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;administration du cardinal d&#x27;Amboise, grand ministre d&#x27;état en France&quot; (&quot;History of the administration of Cardinal D&#x27;Amboise, great minister of state in France&quot;, Paris, 1634), a defence of Georges d&#x27;Amboise; and &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;administration de l&#x27;abbé Suger&quot; (&quot;History of the administration of Abbot Suger&quot;, Paris, 1645). Taking an especial interest in the Turks he wrote &quot;Inventaire général de l&#x27;histoire des Turcs&quot; (&quot;General inventory of the history of the Turks&quot;, Paris, 1619); &quot;Histoire générale de la religion des Turcs avec la vie de leur prophète Mahomet&quot; (&quot;General history of the religion of the Turks with the life of their Prophet Muhammad&quot;, Paris, 1626); and &quot;Histoire générale du sérail et de la cour du grand Turc&quot; (&quot;General history of the harem and of the court of the Grand Turk&quot;, Paris, 1626; English translation by E. Grimeston, London, 1635).

Having heard the narrative of a Jesuit who had returned from China, Baudier wrote &quot;Histoire de la cour du roi de Chine&quot; (&quot;History of the royal court of China&quot;, Paris, 1626; English translation in vol. viii of the &quot;Collection of Voyages and Travels&quot; of Awnsham and John Churchill, London, 1707–1747). He also wrote &quot;Vie du cardinal Ximénès&quot; (&quot;Life of Cardinal Ximénès&quot;, Paris, 1635), which was again published with a notice of the author by E. Baudier (Paris, 1851), and a romance entitled &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;incomparable administration de Romieu, grand ministre d&#x27;état de Raymond Bérenger, comte de Provence&quot; (&quot;History of the incomparable administration Romieu, great minister of the condition of Raymond Bérenger, Count of Provence&quot;, Paris, 1635).

According to Jean-Claude, Baudier knew several languages, and he “wrote not only about France, but also about Spain, England, Italy, China, Persia, and Turkey.”

<text>Intibucá () is one of the 18 departments in the Republic of Honduras. Intibucá covers a total surface area of . Its capital is the city of La Esperanza, in the municipality of La Esperanza.

== History ==
The department of Intibucá was created on April 16, 1883 upon recommendation of the Governor of the department of Gracias (now called Lempira), Jose Maria Cacho in 1869. He advised that the vast size of Gracias made it difficult to govern and that it would be desirable to divide it into more than one department.

On March 7, 1883 Decree No. 10 was issued, which called for the creation of a new department to be named Intibucá in April of that year. The town of La Esperanza was designated to be the capital of the new department. To create the new department, territory from both the departments of Gracias and La Paz were reassigned. 

== Geography ==
The department of Intibucá is situated between latitudes 13°51&#x27;E and 14°42&#x27;N and longitudes 87°46&#x27;W and 88°42&#x27;W. It is bounded on the north by the departments of Comayagua, Lempira, and Santa Bárbara, on the east by the departments of Comayagua and La Paz, on the west by the department of Lempira, and on the south by the Republic of El Salvador. Intibucá is the most mountainous district of Honduras. The capital of La Esperanza lies at an elevation of above sea level. The table-land and valleys are higher than in any other part of the country, and the ranges of the Cordilleras rise to an altitude approaching feet above sea level.

The valley of Otoro is 30 km long by 8 km wide.

The Opalaca mountains have several ridges and crosses over into the department of La Paz. Sierra de Montecillos is a natural border with the department of Comayagua, and contains the mountains Opatoro, Concepción, El Picacho, Goascotoro, El Granadino among others.

=== Rivers ===
Rivers of La Esperanza include the San Juan River and the Intibucá River, which passes through La Esperanza. Otoro River is a tributary of the Ulua River, and carries water to the Otoro valley. The Black River, known by the name of Guarajambala River, serves as a dividing line with the department of Lempira. Torola River and Gualcarque River flow into the Lempa river.

== Population ==
According to the 1895 census, Intibucá had a population of 18,957 people at that time. In 2015, it had grown to 241,568 people, divided among 17 municipalities and 126 villages (aldeas).

== Forest resources ==
The mountains and slopes are well supplied with pine and Oak forests, and the valleys thrive with fertile, well-watered soil, covered with vegetation characteristic of the temperate rather than tropical zone.

== Municipalities ==
Intibucá has the following municipalities of Honduras:
# Camasca
# Colomoncagua
# Concepción
# Dolores
# Intibucá
# Jesús de Otoro
# La Esperanza
# Magdalena
# Masaguara

<text>Admiral Sir Harry Holdsworth Rawson, (5 November 1843 – 3 November 1910) was a British naval officer in the Royal Navy. He is chiefly remembered for overseeing the Benin Expedition of 1897, a British punitive expedition against the Kingdom of Benin (in modern-day Nigeria). Rawson&#x27;s force looted and burned the palace, exiled the &quot;Oba&quot;, and plundered a large number of the Benin Bronzes and other royal treasures. Rawson was appointed Governor of New South Wales, serving from 27 May 1902 to 27 May 1909.

==Early life==
Harry Rawson was born at Walton-on-Hill, Lancashire, on 5 November 1843, the son of Christopher Rawson, of a landed gentry family of The Haugh End and Mill House. He was educated at Eastman&#x27;s Royal Naval Academy and at Marlborough College.

In October 1871 in Cheshire, England, he married Florence Alice Stewart Shaw, daughter of John Ralph Shaw, of Arrowe Park, Cheshire. The couple had five children.

He was a long-standing Freemason, and served as Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.

==Military service==

Rawson joined the Royal Navy in 1857 and took part in the capture of the Taku Forts in 1860 during the Second Opium War. Promoted to captain in 1877, he was given command of . He was the Principal Transport Officer during the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. Then, in 1883, he was made Flag Captain to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet and, in 1885, he was appointed captain of the steam reserve at Devonport. He returned to sea as captain of in 1889.

Admiral Rawson was appointed commander of British naval forces at the Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station in 1895 and held that post at the time of the Benin Expedition which was regarded in British circles largely as a stroke of disciplined and coordinated planning:
In twenty-nine days a force of 1,200 men, coming from three places between 3000 and 4500 m. from the Benin river, was landed, organized, equipped and provided with transport. Five days later the city of Benin was taken, and in twelve days more the men were re-embarked, and the ships coaled and ready for any further service.

Rawson was also the commanding officer of the British forces in the Anglo-Zanzibar War, the shortest war in history, which lasted for 38 minutes on 27 August 1896. For this he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and a first class member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar. He commanded the Channel Squadron from 1898 to April 1901, with HMS &quot;Majestic&quot; as flagship. He was also a recipient of the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Aviz of Portugal, Order of Hamondieh of Zanzibar and Order of Osmanieh of the Ottoman Empire and Civic Cross of Belgium.

==Colonial service==

In February 1902 Rawson was appointed Governor of New South Wales, the first naval officer since William Bligh to hold the post. He kissed hands upon his appointment in an audience with King Edward VII on 24 March, and left for Australia soon thereafter, arriving at Sydney on 26 May 1902 to take up the position the following day. He proved so popular that his term was extended. He lived with his family in Cranbrook, Bellevue Hill, the temporary Government House of New South Wales (Government House, Sydney being used by the Governor-General). In March 1905 (during his term as Governor of New South Wales), his wife was in poor health and returned to England with her son Wyatt and a daughter to seek the best medical advice. Her condition deteriorated and in June 1905 Harry Rawson travelled to England to be with her. In the belief she was recovering, the four of them set sail for Australia in December 1905, but Lady Rawson died on board the ship &quot;Ormuz&quot; in the Red Sea on 3 December 1905 and was buried at sea. From 1903 to 1909, his aide-de-camp was Leslie Orme Wilson, later to be Governor of Queensland.

Rawson died, two days before his 67th birthday, on 3 November 1910 in London after an operation for appendicitis; he was survived by two sons and a daughter.

==Honours==


===Eponyms===

<doc id="317778" wikidata="Q2454958" url="?curid=317778" title="Great Chinese Famine">
<text>The Great Chinese Famine () was a famine that occurred between 1959 and 1961 in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). Some scholars have also included the years 1958 or 1962. It is widely regarded as the deadliest famine and one of the greatest man-made disasters in human history, with an estimated death toll due to starvation that ranges in the tens of millions (15 to 55 million). The most stricken provinces were Anhui (18% dead), Chongqing (15%), Sichuan (13%), Guizhou (11%) and Hunan (8%).

The major contributing factors in the famine were the policies of the Great Leap Forward (1958 to 1962) and people&#x27;s communes, launched by Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party Mao Zedong, such as inefficient distribution of food within the nation&#x27;s planned economy; requiring the use of poor agricultural techniques; the Four Pests campaign that reduced sparrow populations (which disrupted the ecosystem); over-reporting of grain production; and ordering millions of farmers to switch to iron and steel production. During the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference in early 1962, Liu Shaoqi, then President of China, formally attributed 30% of the famine to natural disasters and 70% to man-made errors (&quot;三分天灾, 七分人祸&quot;). After the launch of Reforms and Opening Up, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officially stated in June 1981 that the famine was mainly due to the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward as well as the Anti-Right Deviation Struggle, in addition to some natural disasters and the Sino-Soviet split.

== Terminology ==
Aside from the &quot;Three Years of Great Famine&quot; (), there are two names for the famine that have been used by the Chinese government. Initially, the usual name was &quot;Three Years of Natural Disasters&quot; (). In June 1981, this was changed to &quot;Three Years of Difficulty&quot; (), thus no longer blaming nature alone for the famine.

==Extent of the famine==
=== Production drop ===
Policy changes affecting how farming was organized coincided with droughts and floods. Weather had been relatively mild for much of the 1950s, but became particularly bad by 1959, driving down crop yields. As a result, year-over-year grain production fell dramatically. The harvest was down by 15% in 1959 compared to 1958, and by 1960, it was at 70% of its 1958 level. Specifically, according to China&#x27;s governmental data, crop production decreased from 200 million tons (or 400 billion jin) in 1958 to 170 million tons (or 340 billion jin) in 1959, and to 143.5 million tons (or 287 billion jin) in 1960.

=== Death toll ===
The excess mortality associated with the famine has been estimated by former CCP officials and international experts, with most giving a number in the range of 15–55 million deaths. The Maoist author Gao Mobo claims that anti-communist writers prefer to stretch the death toll number as high as possible while those sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Revolution prefer to see the number as low as possible. Mao Zedong himself suggested, in a discussion with Field Marshal Montgomery in Autumn 1961, that &quot;unnatural deaths&quot; exceeded 5 million in 1960–1961, according to a declassified CIA report. 
Due to the lack of food and incentive to marry at that time, according to China&#x27;s official statistics, China&#x27;s population in 1961 was about 658,590,000, some 14,580,000 lower than in 1959. The birth rate decreased from 2.922% (1958) to 2.086% (1960) and the death rate increased from 1.198% (1958) to 2.543% (1960), while the average numbers for 1962–1965 are about 4% and 1%, respectively. The mortality in the birth and death rates both peaked in 1961 and began recovering rapidly after that, as shown on the chart of census data displayed here. Lu Baoguo, a Xinhua reporter based in Xinyang, explained to Yang Jisheng why he never reported on his experience:

Yu Dehong, the secretary of a party official in Xinyang in 1959 and 1960, stated:
=== Cannibalism ===
There are widespread oral reports, though little official documentation, of human cannibalism being practiced in various forms as a result of the famine. To survive, people had to resort to every possible means, from eating soil and poisons to stealing and killing and even to eating human flesh. Yang Jisheng, a retired Chinese reporter, said &quot;Parents ate their own kids. Kids ate their own parents. And we couldn&#x27;t have imagined there was still grain in the warehouses. At the worst time, the government was still exporting grain.&quot; Due to the scale of the famine, some have speculated that the resulting cannibalism could be described as &quot;on a scale unprecedented in the history of the 20th century&quot;.

==Causes of the famine==
The Great Chinese Famine was caused by a combination of radical agricultural policies, social pressure, economic mismanagement, and natural disasters such as droughts and floods in farming regions.

=== Great Leap Forward ===
The Chinese Communist Party introduced drastic changes in farming policy during the Great Leap Forward.

==== People&#x27;s communes ====
During the Great Leap Forward, farming was organized into people&#x27;s communes and the cultivation of individual plots was forbidden. Previously farmers cultivated plots of land given to them by the government. The Great Leap Forward led to the agricultural economy being increasingly centrally planned. Regional Party leaders were given production quotas for the communes under their control. Their output was then appropriated by the state and distributed at its discretion. In 2008, former deputy editor of Yanhuang Chunqiu and author Yang Jisheng would summarize his perspective of the effect of the production targets as an inability for supply to be redirected to where it was most demanded:
The degree to which people&#x27;s communes lessened or worsened the famine is controversial. Each region dealt with the famine differently, and timelines of the famine are not uniform across China. One argument is that excessive eating took place in the mess halls, and that this directly led to a worsening of the famine. If excessive eating had not taken place, one scholar argued, &quot;the worst of the Great Leap Famine could still have been avoided in mid-1959&quot;. However, dire hunger did not set in to places like Da Fo village until 1960, and the public dining hall participation rate was found not to be a meaningful cause of famine in Anhui and Jiangxi. In Da Fo village, &quot;food &quot;output&quot; did not decline in reality, but there was an astonishing loss of food &quot;availability&quot; associated with Maoist state appropriation&quot;.

==== Agricultural techniques ====
Along with collectivization, the central government decreed several changes in agricultural techniques that would be based on the ideas of later-discredited Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko. One of these ideas was close planting, whereby the density of seedlings was at first tripled and then doubled again. The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.

Another policy known as &quot;deep plowing&quot; was based on the ideas of Lysenko&#x27;s colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal plowing depths of 15–20 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 Chinese feet or 33 to 66 cm). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra-strong root growth. While deep plowing can increase yields in some contexts, the policy is generally considered to have hindered yields in China.

==== Four Pests campaign ====

In the Four Pests campaign, citizens were called upon to destroy mosquitoes, rats, flies, and sparrows. The mass eradication of the sparrows resulted in an increase of the population of crop-eating insects, which had no predators without the sparrows.

==== Illusion of superabundance ====
Beginning in 1957, the Chinese Communist Party began to report excessive production of grain because of pressure from superiors. However, the actual production of grain throughout China was decreasing from 1957 to 1961. For example:
* In Sichuan Province, even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958 to 1961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.
* In Gansu, the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 tonnes from 1957 to 1961.

This series of events resulted in an &quot;illusion of superabundance&quot; (浮夸风), and the Party believed that they had an excess of grain. On the contrary, the crop yields were lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that &quot;in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion &quot;jin&quot; of grain&quot;, when they actually contained 12.7 billion &quot;jin.&quot; The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it was the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali argued that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:

==== Iron and steel production ====
Iron and steel production was identified as a key requirement for economic advancement, and millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce. Much of the iron produced by the peasant population ended up being too weak to be used commercially.

=== More policies from the central government ===
Economists Xin Meng, Nancy Qian and Pierre Yared showed that, much as Nobel laureate Amartya Sen had earlier claimed, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there were surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita, explaining that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality. Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over-procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.

In addition, policies from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the central government, particularly the Three Red Banners and the Socialist Education Movement (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the worsening famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP &quot;sparked the fanaticism of 1958&quot;. The implementation of the Mass line, one of the three banners which told people to &quot;go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results&quot;, is cited in connection to the pressures officials felt to report a superabundance of grain. The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the &quot;illusion of superabundance&quot; (浮夸风). Once the exaggerations of crop yields from the Mass Line were reported, &quot;no one dared to &#x27;dash cold water on further reports. The SEM also led to the establishment of conspiracy theories in which the peasants were believed to be pretending to be hungry in order to sabotage the state grain purchase.

=== Power relations in local governments ===
Local governments had just as much, if not more, influence on the famine than did higher rungs of government. As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began aligning themselves with Mao and higher Party leaders. Local leaders were forced to choose between doing what was best for their community and guarding their reputation politically. Landlords began &quot;denouncing any opposition as &#x27;conservative rightism, which is defined broadly as anything anti-communist. In an environment of conspiracy theories directed against peasants, saving extra grain for a family to eat, espousing the belief that the Great Leap Forward should not be implemented, or merely not working hard enough were all seen as forms of &quot;conservative rightism&quot;. Peasants became unable to speak openly on collectivization and state grain purchase. With a culture of fear and recrimination at both a local and official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.

The influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by Zeng Xisheng who was &quot;dictatorial&quot;, with ties to Mao. Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to build relationships with higher officials rather than maintain local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues, which caused Anhui&#x27;s agriculture to fail terribly. Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng&#x27;s policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations. As a result, Mao labeled Zhang &quot;a member of the &#x27;Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique and he was purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report on the famine when it became an emergency situation, as this would prove his hypocrisy. For this he was described as a &quot;blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui&quot;.

Jiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population. By creating an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government &quot;did their best to minimize damage&quot;. From these findings, scholars Manning and Wemheuer concluded that much of the severity of the famine was due to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.

=== Natural disasters ===

In 1958, there was a notable regional flood of the Yellow River which affected part of Henan Province and Shandong Province. It was reported as the most severe flood of the Yellow River since 1933. In July 1958, the Yellow River flood affected 741,000 people in 1708 villages and inundated over 3.04 million mu (over half a million acres) of cultivated fields. The largest torrent of the flood was smoothly directed into the Bohai Sea on 27 July, and the government declared a &quot;victory over the flood&quot; after sending a rescue team of over 2 million people. The spokesperson of the Flood Prevention Center of Chinese government stated on 27 July 1958, that:

But the government was encouraged to report success and hide failures. Because the 2 million farm laborers from the two provinces were ordered away from the fields to serve as a rescue team and were repairing the banks of the river instead of tending to their fields, &quot;crops are neglected and much of the harvest is left to rot in the fields&quot;. In contrast, historian Frank Dikötter has argued that most floods during the famine were not due to unusual weather, but to massive, poorly planned and poorly executed irrigation works which were part of the Great Leap Forward. At this time, encouraged by Mao Zedong, people in China were building a large number of dams and thousands of kilometers of new irrigation canals in an attempt to move water from wet areas to areas that were experiencing drought. Some of the works, such as the Red Flag Canal, made positive contributions to irrigation, but researchers have pointed out that the massive hydraulic construction project led to many deaths due to starvation, epidemics, and drowning, which contributed to the famine.

However, there have been disagreements on the significance of the drought and floods in causing the Great Famine. According to published data from Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (), the drought in 1960 was not uncommon and its severity was only considered &quot;mild&quot; compared to that in other years—it was less serious than those in 1955, 1963, 1965–1967, and so on. Moreover, Yang Jisheng, a senior journalist from Xinhua News Agency, reports that Xue Muqiao, then head of the National Statistics Bureau of China, said in 1958, &quot;We give whatever figures the upper-level wants&quot; to overstate natural disasters and relieve official responsibility for deaths due to starvation. Yang claimed that he investigated other sources including a non-government archive of meteorological data from 350 weather stations across China, and the droughts, floods, and temperatures during 1958–1961 were within the typical patterns for China. According to Basil Ashton:

Despite these claims, other scholars have provided provincial-level demographic panel data which quantitatively proved that weather was also an important factor, particularly in those provinces which experienced excessively wet conditions. According to economist Daniel Houser and others, 69% of the Famine was due to government policies while the rest (31%) was due to natural disasters.

== Aftermath ==
=== Initial reactions and cover-ups ===

Local party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions. Mao was kept unaware of some of the starvation of villagers in the rural areas who were suffering, as the birth rate began to plummet and deaths increased in 1958 and 1959. In 1960, as gestures of solidarity, Mao ate no meat for seven months and Zhou Enlai cut his monthly grain consumption.

In visits to Henan province in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called &quot;sputnik launches&quot;. But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao&#x27;s visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.

The local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by &quot;deep ploughing and close planting&quot;, among other techniques. This ended up making things much worse; the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao&#x27;s ideas as incorrect, so peasants went to extreme lengths to keep up the charade; some grew seedlings in their bedding and coats and, after the seedlings quickly sprouted, &quot;planted&quot; them in fields—the bedding made the plants look high and healthy.

The post office in Xinyang confiscated 1,200 outgoing letters begging for help. Yang Jisheng, a retired Chinese reporter, said:

Like in the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the Holodomor), doctors were prohibited from listing &quot;starvation&quot; as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous propaganda picture from the famine shows Chinese children from Shandong province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the &quot;field&quot; was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.

=== Response from Taiwan ===
In response to the famine, the Nationalist government in Taipei delivered food, along with propaganda leaflets of Chiang Kai-shek, to the mainland via parachute drops conducted by the ROC air force.

=== Cultural Revolution ===
In April and May 1961, Liu Shaoqi, then President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of Hunan that the causes of the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error (三分天灾, 七分人祸).

In January and February 1962, the &quot;7000 Cadres Conference&quot; took place in Beijing, which was attended by more than 7,000 CCP officials nationwide. During the conference, Liu formally announced his conclusion on the causes of the great famine, while the Great Leap Forward was declared &quot;over&quot; by the Chinese Communist Party. The policies of Mao Zedong were criticized.

The failure of the Great Leap Forward as well as the famine forced Mao Zedong to withdraw from active decision-making within the CCP and the central government, and turn various future responsibilities over to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. A series of economic reforms were carried out by Liu and Deng and others, including policies such as &quot;sanzi yibao&quot; (三自一包) which allowed free market and household responsibility for agricultural production.

However, the disagreement between Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping over economic and social policy grew larger. In 1963, Mao launched the Socialist Education Movement and in 1966, he launched the Cultural Revolution, during which Liu was accused of being a traitor and enemy agent for attributing only 30% to natural calamities. Liu was beaten and denied medicine for diabetes and pneumonia; he died in 1969. Deng was accused of being a &quot;capitalist roader&quot; during the Cultural Revolution and was purged twice.

=== Reforms and reflections ===
In December 1978, Deng Xiaoping became the new Paramount Leader of China and launched the historic Reforms and Opening Up program which fundamentally changed the agricultural and industrial system in China. Until the early 1980s, the Chinese government&#x27;s stance was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors, reflected by the name &quot;Three Years of Natural Disasters&quot;. During the &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; period in June 1981, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officially changed the name to &quot;Three Years of Difficulty&quot;, and stated that the famine was mainly due to the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward as well as the Anti-Right Deviation Struggle, in addition to some natural disasters and the Sino-Soviet split. Academic studies on the Great Chinese Famine also became more active in mainland China after 1980, when the government started to release some demographic data to the public. A number of high-ranking Chinese officials had expressed their views on the famine:
* Zhao Ziyang, former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, once said that &quot;our Party never admitted mistakes. If things got really bad, we just found some scapegoats and blamed them, like Lin Biao and the Gang of Four. If scapegoats were hard to find, we simply blamed natural disasters, such as for the great famine in the late 1950s and early 1960s when tens of millions of people died, which was simply due to political errors of the Party.&quot;
* Bo Yibo, one of the Eight Elders and former Vice Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, once said, &quot;During the three difficult years, people across the country went into malnutrition due to lack of food, and edema was prevalent, resulting in an increasing number of deaths due to starvation among many rural areas. It is estimated that in 1960 alone, more than 10 million people died. With such thing happening during a time of peace, we as members of the Communist Party feel truly guilty in front of the people, and we must never forget this heavy lesson! &quot;
* Wan Li, former President of the National People&#x27;s Congress of China, stated that &quot;during the three difficult years after the People&#x27;s Commune movement, people everywhere had edema and even starved to death. In Anhui alone, according to reports, there were 3-4 million people died &#x27;abnormally&#x27; ... We had been &#x27; left &#x27; for too long, and farmers were no longer motivated to work.&quot;
*Tian Jiyun, former Vice Premier of China and former Vice President of the National People&#x27;s Congress of China, stated that &quot;looking back at the Three Years of Difficulty, people everywhere had edema and died of starvation, and tens of millions of people died abnormally, more than the total death toll during the entire Democratic Revolution. What was the reason for that? Liu Shaoqi said it was &#x27;30% natural disasters and 70% human error.&#x27; But it is now clear that the famine was mainly due to human error, which was the erroneous command, the &#x27;Utopian Socialism&#x27;, and the &#x27;Left opportunism&#x27;.&quot;

Researchers outside China have argued that the massive institutional and policy changes which accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters. In particular, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: &quot;Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country—no matter how poor.&quot; He adds that it is &quot;hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press. During that terrible calamity the government faced no pressure from newspapers, which were controlled, and none from opposition parties, which were absent.&quot; Sen though also argues: &quot;Despite the gigantic size of excess mortality in the Chinese famine, the extra mortality in India from regular deprivation in normal times vastly overshadows the former. [...] India seems to manage to fill its cupboard with more skeletons every eight years than China put there in its years of shame.&quot;

<text>Tom Miller Dam is a dam located on the Colorado River within the city limits of Austin, Texas, United States. The City of Austin, aided by funds from the Public Works Administration, constructed the dam for the purpose of flood control and for generating hydroelectric power. Named after Robert Thomas Miller, a former Mayor of Austin, the dam forms Lake Austin, one of the Texas Highland Lakes.

The dam began operating in 1940 and is located at the site of the city&#x27;s two previous dams, each of which were destroyed during major floods and shared the same name, Austin Dam. It is currently leased to the Lower Colorado River Authority, who maintains and operates the dam.

<text>Karl Josef von Hefele (March 15, 1809 – June 6, 1893) was a Roman Catholic bishop and theologian of Germany.

==Biography==
Hefele was born at Unterkochen in Württemberg and was educated at Tübingen, where in 1839 he became professor-ordinary of Church history and patristics in the Roman Catholic faculty of theology, while collaborating along with William Robinson Clark to his major work.

From 1842 to 1845 he sat in the National Assembly of Württemberg. In December 1869 he was enthroned bishop of Rottenburg. His literary activity, which had been considerable, was in no way diminished by his elevation to the episcopate. Among his numerous theological works may be mentioned his well-known edition of the Apostolic Fathers, issued in 1839; his &quot;Life of Cardinal Ximenes&quot;, published in 1844 as &quot;Der Cardinal Ximenes und der kirchlichen Zustände Spaniens am Ende des 15. und am Anfange des 16. Jahrhunderts&quot; (Eng. trans. by John Dalton, 1860); and his still more celebrated &quot;Conciliengeschichte&quot; (&quot;History of the Councils of the Church&quot;), in seven volumes, which appeared between 1855 and 1874 (Eng. trans., 1871, 1882).

Hefele&#x27;s theological opinions inclined towards the more liberal school in the Roman Catholic Church, but he nevertheless received considerable signs of favour from its authorities, and was a member of the commission that made preparations for the Vatican Council of 1870. On the eve of that council he published at Naples his &quot;Causa Honorii Papae&quot;, which aimed at demonstrating the moral and historical impossibility of papal infallibility. About the same time he brought out a work in German on the same subject. He took rather a prominent part in the discussions at the council, associating himself with Félix Dupanloup and with Georges Darboy, archbishop of Paris, in his opposition to the doctrine of Infallibility, and supporting their arguments from his vast knowledge of ecclesiastical history. In the preliminary discussions he voted against the promulgation of the dogma. He was absent from the important sitting of June 18, 1870, and did not send in his submission to the decrees until 1871, when he explained in a pastoral letter that the dogma &quot;referred only to doctrine given forth &quot;ex cathedra&quot;, and therein to the definitions proper only, but not to its proofs or explanations&quot;.

In 1872 he took part in the congress summoned by the Ultramontanes at Fulda, and by his judicious use of minimizing tactics he kept his diocese free from any participation in the Old Catholic schism. The last four volumes of the second edition of his &quot;History of the Councils&quot; have been described as skillfully adapted to the new situation created by the Vatican decrees. During the later years of his life he undertook no further literary efforts on behalf of his church, but retired into relative privacy.

Hefele died in Rottenburg am Neckar.

In the 13th and 14th centuries the lands were gradually transferred to Murbach-Lucerne and Engelberg Abbeys. Between the 12th and 13th centuries, the von Wolfenschiessen family were, probably, raised from farming to minor nobility and appointed to administer the monastery’s estates at Wolfenschiessen. They built a tower in the center of the village from which they administered and ruled over the village and farms. The family eventually grew to local prominence, before losing most of their wealth and status in the 15th century and dying out at the beginning of the 17th century.

A village church was built by 1277 but was initially a filial church of the parish church in Stans. The village received its own priest in 1438 and in 1469 became an independent parish. During the 14th through 16th centuries several other hamlets developed around Wolfenschiessen.

<text>Audiotape is magnetic tape used for storing audio. Information stored can be in the form of either an analog or digital signal. Audiotape can be used in various tape recorders including machines for reel-to-reel audio tape recording on open reels or they can be enclosed in cases that only have one reel (tape cartridge) or two reels (cassette tape).

==History==

The use of magnetic tape for sound recording can be traced back to 1924 when German engineer, Kurt Stille, developed a dictation machine that used steel wires called the Poulsen wire recorder. Louis Blattner, a German engineer working in Britain, licensed Stille&#x27;s technology the following year and started work on a machine that would be able to record on a magnetic steel tape. The machine would later be called the Blattnerphone. The machine used steel tape that was 6 mm wide and 0.08 mm thick. It travelled at 5 feet per second and was able to record up to 20 minutes of audio. Although the tape was used by some organizations like the BBC, the quality was deemed not suitable for music recording so it was mainly used for dictation recording.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1930s when the quality of tape improved when German company BASF made a new formula for the tape to be thinner and not use complete steel. The idea was based on Fritz Pfleumer&#x27;s 1928 invention of paper tape with oxide powder lacquered onto it.

==Reel recording==

The advancement of tape formulation and tape heads led to the increase capacity of recording audio and quality of the sound. The first machines to be able to read and record on tape did so using reels similar to film. At first, only news broadcasters used tape for recordings since the quality was not good but eventually, recording studios and record labels starting using the format to record music and albums.

The tape used by reel machines varied in size and formulation with various companies and even broadcasters using their own proprietary methods to record onto tape. The tape at which the tape was read was also important to these machines as a slower speed meant an audible hiss could be heard while playing back the recording. Eventually, Standarization became more relevant and compatible formats were released for both professional recording and eventually home recording.

==Tape cartridges and cassette tapes==
The advancements in technology also meant that tape could be stored in more compatible formats although with reduced quality in audio. The first releases featured tape wrapped around in a single reel known as &quot;tape cartridges&quot;. There were tape cartridges for professional use like the Fidelipac and cartridges for consumers with 8-track cartridge.

Eventually the need to replicate reel to reel recording led to the creation of the &quot;cassette&quot; format, later also known as audiocassette, which utilized two reels inside. RCA released the first such format with the RCA tape cartridge which still used the cartridge name but it would be Philips that released the most viable and still popular format for audio cassette with the Compact Cassette. Philips also coined the word &quot;cassette&quot; for these plastic units, taking the word from French which meant &quot;little case&quot;.

<text>Georges Darboy (; 16 January 181324 May 1871) was a French Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Nancy then Archbishop of Paris. He was among a group of prominent hostages executed as the Paris Commune of 1871 was about to be overthrown.

==Biography==
Darboy was born in Fayl-Billot, Haute-Marne in north-east France. He studied with distinction at the seminary at Langres, and was ordained priest in 1836. Transferred to Paris as almoner of the college of Henry IV, and honorary canon of Notre Dame, he became the close friend of Archbishop Affre and of his successor Archbishop Sibour. He was appointed bishop of Nancy in 1859, and in January 1863 was raised to the archbishopric of Paris.

Darboy was a strenuous upholder of episcopal independence in the Gallican sense, and involved himself in a controversy with Rome by his endeavours to suppress the jurisdiction of the Jesuits and other religious orders within his diocese. Pope Pius IX refused him the cardinal&#x27;s hat, and rebuked him for his liberalism in a letter which was probably not intended for publication. He is also known for his opposition in 1868 to Jacques-Paul Migne, forbidding him to continue his low-cost books business after the burning of his printing establishment, and suspending him from his priestly functions. At the First Vatican Council he vigorously maintained the rights of the bishops, and strongly opposed the dogma of papal infallibility, against which he voted as inopportune. When the dogma had been finally adopted, however, he was one of the first to set the example of submission.

===Commune and Execution===
Immediately after his return to Paris the war with Prussia broke out, and his conduct during the disastrous year that followed was marked by a devoted heroism which has secured for him an enduring fame. He was active in organizing relief for the wounded at the commencement of the war, remained at his post during the siege, and refused to seek safety by flight during the brief triumph of the Paris Commune. On 4 April 1871, he was arrested by the Communards as a hostage and confined in Mazas Prison. The Communards offered to exchange him and several priests for Louis Auguste Blanqui, who was being held by the Versailles government. He was transferred to La Roquette Prisons on the advance of the Versailles army, and on 24 May he was shot within the prison along with several other prominent hostages. The execution was ordered by Théophile Ferré, who later was executed by firing squad by the French government after the fall of the Commune.

==Legacy==
Darboy died in the attitude of blessing and uttering words of forgiveness. His body was recovered with difficulty, and, having been embalmed, was buried with imposing ceremony at public expense on 7 June. He was the third archbishop of Paris to die violently between 1848 and 1871 after Denis Auguste Affre (killed 1848) and Marie-Dominique-Auguste Sibour (assassinated in 1857).

A cause for the beatification of Darboy and the other hostages was formally opened on 16 March 1937, granting them the title of Servants of God.

<doc id="317790" wikidata="Q176346" url="?curid=317790" title="Frank O'Bannon">
<text>Frank Lewis O&#x27;Bannon (January 30, 1930 – September 13, 2003) was an American politician who served as the 47th governor of Indiana from 1997 until his death in 2003. He is the most recent American state Governor to have died in office.

O&#x27;Bannon was a native of Corydon, Indiana. He graduated from Corydon High School (now Corydon Central High School) in 1948 and then Indiana University Bloomington, where he met his wife Judy. In Corydon, he served as a practicing attorney and a newspaper publisher for &quot;The Corydon Democrat&quot; before his entrance into the political arena.

A conservative Democrat, O&#x27;Bannon was first elected to the Indiana Senate in 1969. He eventually became one of the body&#x27;s most prominent members. O&#x27;Bannon ran for Governor of Indiana in 1988; however, instead of facing a hotly competitive primary, O&#x27;Bannon dropped out of the race and became the running mate of Evan Bayh. The Bayh/O&#x27;Bannon ticket was successful, and O&#x27;Bannon served in the role of lieutenant governor for eight years. In this position, he served as President of the State Senate and directed the state&#x27;s agriculture and commerce programs.

With Bayh ineligible to seek a third consecutive term as governor in 1996, O&#x27;Bannon ran for governor that year. He was initially considered a heavy underdog but emerged a narrow victor over Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith. He was re-elected in 2000, defeating Congressman David M. McIntosh. As governor, O&#x27;Bannon was known for advocating for education-related issues and helping to create the state&#x27;s AMBER Alert System. He presided over a period of economic prosperity for the state in the 1990s and served a term as Chairman of Midwestern Governors Association. O&#x27;Bannon died in office in 2003 and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Joe Kernan. He is the most recent governor of any U.S. state to die in office. To date, he is also the most recent Democrat to be elected governor of Indiana.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Bannon was a native of Corydon, Indiana (the first state capital of Indiana), where his family owned the &quot;Corydon Democrat&quot;, the town&#x27;s newspaper. His father, Robert Presley O&#x27;Bannon, served in the Indiana House of Representatives and later served in the Indiana Senate. His mother was the former Faith Dropsey. Frank&#x27;s great-grandfather was named for his uncle, Presley Neville O&#x27;Bannon, a First Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps who was the first to raise the US flag on foreign soil in a time of war, on April 27, 1805, during the Tripoli Campaign in the First Barbary War. He attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he played one season of basketball for the Hoosiers. At Indiana University, he was president of the Zeta chapter of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in government in 1952, and a Juris Doctor in 1957 from the Indiana University School of Law.

He also spent two years in the United States Air Force and became a first lieutenant. While at Indiana University, he met his wife, Judith Asmus, on a blind date. They married in 1957, and had three children. Following law school, he opened a law office in Corydon, was chairman of the board of the family newspaper publishing firm (a position he held until the time of his death), and was a member of the board of the Corydon Savings and Loan.

==Political career==
===Indiana Senate===
First elected to the state senate in 1969-70 to a seat occupied by his father, Robert P. O&#x27;Bannon, from 1950 to 1970, Frank O&#x27;Bannon was the primary sponsor of legislation reintroducing the death penalty. He rose to the rank of Senate Minority Leader among Democrats during his tenure in the legislative body. He served one two-year stint as chair of the Senate Finance Committee following a short-lived Democratic majority.

===Lieutenant Governor of Indiana===
On January 13, 1987, O&#x27;Bannon announced he would run for governor in 1988. He formally launched his campaign in May 1987 from Corydon, Indiana, touting his legislative experience. O&#x27;Bannon initially faced off against then-Secretary of State Evan Bayh and Kokomo Mayor Steve Daily. O&#x27;Bannon abandoned his own bid for governor in January 1988 and ran for Lieutenant Governor with Bayh. The ticket was victorious in November, and O&#x27;Bannon was elected as the 46th Lieutenant Governor of Indiana. His candidacy for lieutenant governor matched that of his grandfather, Lew M. O&#x27;Bannon, who was the 1924 Democratic nominee for the state&#x27;s second-highest office. As lieutenant governor, he presided as President of the State Senate, served as the state&#x27;s Director of Commerce and Commissioner of Agriculture.

===Governor of Indiana===

In 1996, with Evan Bayh ineligible to seek a third consecutive term as governor due to term limits, O&#x27;Bannon became the Democratic nominee for governor. He overcame an early deficit in the polls against his Republican opponent, Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith and won in a close race, 52% to 47%. He was re-elected by a larger margin, 57% to 42%, in 2000 against second district Congressman David M. McIntosh.

During the boom years of the 1990s, when Indiana amassed a record $2 billion surplus, O&#x27;Bannon was able to cut taxes by $1.5 billion, hire 500 more police officers in the state and win increased funding for schools and extended health insurance for poor families. He also signed landmark legislation creating the AMBER Alert program in Indiana, as well as legislation requiring drivers to slow or change lanes for emergency vehicles stopped along Hoosier roadways.

In the years of 1998 and 1999 O&#x27;Bannon served as the Chairman of Midwestern Governors Association. In 1999, O&#x27;Bannon created the Public Access Counselor Office by executive order after a statewide collaboration of seven newspapers found great obstacles in obtaining government information in Indiana. In 1999, the Indiana General Assembly established it by statute.

In 2000 he won an easy re-election bid under the theme of Keeping Indiana Moving in the Right Direction. Furthermore, he was seen as a tough candidate to beat owing to his own personal affability. His opponent in the election, 2nd District Congressman David McIntosh said: &quot;Everywhere I&#x27;d go, people would say that to me: &#x27;How are you going to run against someone who is everyone&#x27;s grandfather?&#x27;&quot; His campaign featured memorable advertisements with O&#x27;Bannon reprising his basketball past by shooting a perfect jump shot.

After the September 11 attacks and subsequent market downturn, Indiana lost 120,000 jobs, tax revenues dropped, and O&#x27;Bannon had to cut social services and other services in order to spare education. In 2001 he worked with the state legislature to formulate a major restructuring of the state tax system. His opponents blamed him for various problems arising in the second term, including a slow response by his environmental agency to a big fish kill, and problems at two-state centers for the developmentally disabled.

His record, however, was firmly established as an educational leader for the state. He helped lead development of Indiana&#x27;s first community college system, pushed for early-childhood learning opportunities, development of alternative high schools, and charter schools. His work as chair of the state&#x27;s landmark Education Roundtable ensured that Indiana was one of only five states whose schools immediately qualified as meeting all standards set by the federal No Child Left Behind act upon enactment. In regards to education, O’Bannon placed emphasis on enhancing the state&#x27;s public schools. He was able to pass increased funding for education . However, the state legislature did not pass O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s proposal for full-day kindergarten.

O&#x27;Bannon attempted to install a stone monument featuring the Ten Commandments on the state capitol grounds. However, the courts blocked this effort.

==Death and legacy==

O&#x27;Bannon suffered a massive stroke on September 8, 2003, while he was in Chicago attending the U.S. Midwest–Japan trade conference. He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he remained unconscious, and his condition worsened over the following days. In accordance with his living will, his family discontinued further treatment, and he died on September 13, aged 73. O&#x27;Bannon donated organs (having signed legislation making organ donation easier in Indiana), including his cornea, which helped an Illinois woman regain her sight. O’Bannon&#x27;s ashes were scattered in the family plot at Cedar Hill Cemetery in his hometown of Corydon, Indiana.

O&#x27;Bannon was succeeded in office by Lieutenant Governor Joe E. Kernan of South Bend, who was sworn into office just hours after O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s death.

O&#x27;Bannon is the subject of the 2006 biography &quot;Legacy of a Governor: The Life of Indiana&#x27;s Frank O&#x27;Bannon&quot;.

In February 2006, a memorial bust of O&#x27;Bannon was placed outside the Indiana Statehouse Senate chambers.

Judy O&#x27;Bannon resided in her husband&#x27;s hometown of Corydon, Indiana, and remained active in Democratic politics and in her husband&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Corydon Democrat&quot;. She hosted a statewide public television program, &quot;Communities Building Community.&quot; In November 2013, she married Donald Willsey.

<text>Wirtz Dam (formerly Granite Shoals Dam) was constructed from 1949 to 1951 to provide hydroelectric power and to form Lake Lyndon B. Johnson (formerly Lake Granite Shoals), one of the Texas Highland Lakes. Lake LBJ ‒ as it is more commonly referred to ‒ provides cooling water for the Lower Colorado River Authority&#x27;s Thomas C. Ferguson Power Plant along Horseshoe Bay.

Wirtz Dam was originally named Granite Shoals Dam until 1951 when it was renamed in honor of Alvin J. Wirtz who had been instrumental in the formation of the LCRA.

Likewise, Lake LBJ was originally named Lake Granite Shoals until 1965 when it was renamed for another advocate of the LCRA, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Wirtz Dam and Lake LBJ are located due west of Lake Marble Falls and the city of Marble Falls, Texas.

<doc id="317793" wikidata="Q7716427" url="?curid=317793" title="The Belles of St. Lemons">
<text>The Belles of St. Lemons was a British comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot;, first appearing in issue 1495, although the characters themselves had first been introduced in the 1968 edition of &quot;The Beano Annual&quot;. It was drawn by Gordon Bell and ran from 1971 to 1972.

The title of the series was both a play on the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; and Ronald Searle&#x27;s Belles of &quot;St. Trinians&quot; cartoons.

==Overview==
St. Lemons was essentially the girls&#x27; boarding-school equivalent of The Bash Street Kids – the &quot;belles&quot; all conforming to comic stereotypes (the fat one, the unintelligent one, the leader etc.). The headmistress of the school was Miss Clump (originally Miss Phit in the annuals). The weekly strip ended around 1972, although further episodes continued to appear in The Beano Annuals.

==Characters==
The Belles were:

*Curli – The one who had hair curlers in her hair, and was fond of knitting. She is revealed in the annuals to have a close friendship with Spotty of The Bash Street Kids.
*Dizzi – The ugly one, similar to Plug of The Bash Street Kids.
*Dozi – The sleepy one.
*Dumpling – The fat one, similar to Fatty of The Bash Street Kids.
*Kooki – The one who was fond of cooking.
*Mina – Didn&#x27;t speak much, but had a myna bird on her head that would do most of the talking for her.
*Piggi – The one with many spots, similar to Spotty of The Bash Street Kids.
*Poni – The one who had a pony.
*Prune – The leader of the group, filling the role of Danny from The Bash Street Kids.
*Swotti – The clever one – seemingly a mixture of &#x27;Erbert and Cuthbert, two characters from The Bash Street Kids strips.
*Blondie – The blonde one.
*Suzie – One of the Belles, apparently an ordinary girl.
*Puddy – A black, tomboy tabby-cat who serves as the school mascot. To an extent, she filled the role occupied by Winston in The Bash Street Kids strips.

Other characters featured in the strips included the rival St. Sniffles School (similar to Posh Street School, a rival of Bash Street School), and occasional cameos from The Bash Street Kids themselves.

<doc id="317794" wikidata="Q1800987" url="?curid=317794" title="Lake Lyndon B. Johnson">
<text>Lake Lyndon B. Johnson (more commonly referred to as Lake LBJ and originally named Lake Granite Shoals) is a reservoir on the Colorado River in the Texas Hill Country about 45 miles northwest of Austin. The reservoir was formed in 1950 by the construction of Granite Shoals Dam by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA). The Colorado River and the Llano River meet in the northern portion of the lake at Kingsland.

==Location and history==

The towns of Granite Shoals, Kingsland, Horseshoe Bay, Highland Haven, and Sunrise Beach are located on the lake. The boundary line separating Burnet County and Llano County runs down the center of the lake.

The lake was originally called Lake Granite Shoals. The dam would be renamed Wirtz Dam in 1952 for Alvin J. Wirtz, the first general counsel of the LCRA, and the lake was renamed to Lake Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 in honor of US President Lyndon Baines Johnson. In addition to his work to enact the Rural Electrification Act that formed the basis for building the Texas Highland Lakes, President Johnson owned a ranch on the lake (which was separate and apart from the LBJ Ranch in Stonewall, Texas). He and Mrs. Johnson entertained national and foreign dignitaries on the lake during his vice presidency and presidency.

The other reservoirs on the Colorado River are Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, Lake Austin, and Lady Bird Lake. Lake LBJ along with Inks Lake and Lake Marble Falls are pass-through lakes for Lake Buchanan and Lake Travis. There is no room in Lake LBJ for additional water storage, and water that comes in must go out. Therefore, Lake LBJ is at a near constant level, but the level can fluctuate, especially during a flood. The LCRA lowers the lake periodically for maintenance on Wirtz Dam and to allow landowners to remove sediment around their docks.

==Fish and wildlife populations==
Lake LBJ has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Lake LBJ include largemouth bass, white bass, catfish, and crappie. Lake LBJ is one of the Highland Lakes infested with hydrilla, a non-native aquatic plant species, and the LCRA is undergoing treatment to eradicate the hydrilla.

==Recreational uses==

Most of the property bordering Lake LBJ is privately owned. The Nightengale Archaeological Center at Kingsland is a unique educational park operated by the Lower Colorado River Authority that is adjacent to Lake LBJ. The lake is also home to Camp Champions, the only summer camp with property on the lake. The popularity of Lake LBJ is largely due to its normally constant level water which provides ideal conditions for boating, water skiing, riding personal water craft and other water sports. Swimming in summer months is inadvisable due to the presence of the rare but deadly Naegleria fowleri.

==Cooling water==
The lake provides cooling water for the Thomas C. Ferguson Power Plant that is located on its shores.

<text>Ronald William Fordham Searle (3 March 1920 – 30 December 2011) was an English artist and satirical cartoonist, comics artist, sculptor, medal designer and illustrator. He is perhaps best remembered as the creator of St Trinian&#x27;s School and for his collaboration with Geoffrey Willans on the Molesworth series.

==Biography==
Searle was born in Cambridge, England, where his father was a Post Office worker who repaired telephone lines. He started drawing at the age of five and left school (Central School – now Parkside School) at the age of 15. He trained at Cambridge College of Arts and Technology (now Anglia Ruskin University) for two years.

In April 1939, realizing that war was inevitable, he abandoned his art studies to enlist in the Royal Engineers. In January 1942, he was in the 287th Field Company, RE in Singapore. After a month of fighting in Malaya, he was taken prisoner along with his cousin Tom Fordham Searle, when Singapore fell to the Japanese. He spent the rest of the war as prisoner, first in Changi Prison and then in the Kwai jungle, working on the Siam-Burma Death Railway. Searle contracted both beriberi and malaria during his incarceration, which included numerous beatings, and his weight dropped to less than 40 kilograms. He was liberated in late 1945 with the final defeat of the Japanese. After the war, he served as a courtroom artist at the Nuremberg trials and later the Adolf Eichmann trial (1961).

He married the journalist Kaye Webb in 1947; they had twins, Kate and Johnny. In 1961, Searle moved to Paris, leaving his family; the marriage ended in divorce in 1967. Later he married Monica Koenig, a painter, theatre and jewellery designer. After 1975, Searle and his wife lived and worked in the mountains of Haute Provence.

Searle&#x27;s wife Monica died in July 2011 and he himself died on 30 December 2011, aged 91.

==Early work as war artist during captivity==

Although Searle published the first St Trinian&#x27;s cartoon in the magazine &quot;Lilliput&quot; in 1941, his professional career really begins with his documentation of the brutal camp conditions of his period as a prisoner-of-war of the Japanese in World War II in a series of drawings that he hid under the mattresses of prisoners dying of cholera. Searle recalled, &quot;I desperately wanted to put down what was happening, because I thought if by any chance there was a record, even if I died, someone might find it and know what went on.&quot; But Searle survived, along with approximately 300 of his drawings. Liberated late in 1945, Searle returned to England, where he published several of the drawings in fellow prisoner Russell Braddon&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Island&quot;. Another of Searle&#x27;s fellow prisoners later recounted, &quot;If you can imagine something that weighs six stone or so, is on the point of death and has no qualities of the human condition that aren&#x27;t revolting, calmly lying there with a pencil and a scrap of paper, drawing, you have some idea of the difference of temperament that this man had from the ordinary human being.&quot;

Most of these drawings appear in his 1986 book, &quot;Ronald Searle: To the Kwai and Back, War Drawings 1939–1945&quot;. In the book, Searle also wrote of his experiences as a prisoner, including the day he woke up to find a dead friend on either side of him, and a live snake underneath his head:
At least one of his drawings is on display at the Changi Museum and Chapel, Singapore, but the majority of his originals are in the permanent collection of the Imperial War Museum, London, along with the works of other POW artists. The best known of these are John Mennie, Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky and Ashley George Old. In 2002, additional war drawings by Searle were discovered in Melbourne, Australia. They depict the Australian soldier Henry &quot;Lofty&quot; Cannon, who Searle credits with saving his life while they were prisoners of war. These drawings are now held by the State Library of Victoria.

==Magazines, books, and films==

Searle produced an extraordinary volume of work during the 1950s, including drawings for &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Punch&quot;. His cartoons appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; and the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;. He compiled more St Trinian&#x27;s books, which were based on his sister&#x27;s school and other girls&#x27; schools in Cambridge. He collaborated with Geoffrey Willans on the Molesworth books (&quot;Down With Skool!&quot;, 1953, and &quot;How to be Topp&quot;, 1954), and with Alex Atkinson on travel books. In addition to advertisements and posters, Searle drew the title backgrounds of the Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder film &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot;.

After moving to Paris in 1961, he worked more on reportage for &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot; and less on cartoons. He also continued to work in a broad range of media and created books (including his well-known cat books), animated films and sculpture for commemorative medals, both for the French Mint and the British Art Medal Society. Searle did a considerable amount of designing for the cinema, and in 1965, he completed the opening, intermission and closing credits for the comedy film &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot; as well as the 1969 film &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust!&quot; In 1975, the full-length cartoon &quot;Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done&quot; was released. It is based on the character and songs from &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;.

==Medallist==

Searle designed the 1992 delegates medal for the FIDEM XXIII Congress London. It depicted a half-length bust of the renaissance medallist Pisanello and was struck by the Royal Mint. Other notable medals were &quot;Searle at Seventy&quot; (1990) and &quot;Kwai 50th Anniversary&quot; (1991), both struck by Thomas Fattorini Ltd, and &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; (1983) struck by the Birmingham Mint.

==Archives==
In 2010, he gave about 2,200 of his works as permanent loans to Wilhelm Busch Museum, Hanover (Germany), now renamed . Previously the summer palace of George I of Hanover, this museum also holds Searle&#x27;s archives.

==Awards==
Searle received much recognition for his work, especially in America, including the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Advertising and Illustration Award in 1959 and 1965, the Reuben Award in 1960, their Illustration Award in 1980 and their Advertising Award in 1986 and 1987. Searle was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2004. In 2007, he was decorated with one of France&#x27;s highest awards, the Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur, and in 2009, he received the German Lower Saxony Order of Merit.

==Influence==
Without the satirical works of Searle the development of satirical and political cartoons — found across the range of daily and Sunday national newspapers — in the United Kingdom would be distinctly different, as his impact touched many developing artists of the later 20th century through into the twenty-first. Significantly, he was an important influence on the work and style of both Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman — with who there is an obvious link with the scratchy, ink splotting style they all use — along with Chris Riddell, as well as inspiring and corresponding in late life with Martin Rowson to whom he gave a precious set of pens that he had bought in Paris.

Across the Atlantic, Searle was an admiring friend of, and admired by, the satirical humorist S. J. Perelman. His work has had a great deal of influence, particularly on American cartoonists, including Edward Gorey, Pat Oliphant, Matt Groening, Hilary Knight, and the animators of Disney&#x27;s &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;.

He was an early influence on John Lennon&#x27;s drawing style which featured in the books &quot;In His Own Write&quot; and &quot;A Spaniard in the Works&quot;. Anglia Ruskin University has named the Ronald Searle Award for Creativity in the Arts in his honour.

<text>The Benin Expedition of 1897 was a punitive expedition by a British force of 1,200 men under Sir Harry Rawson. It came in response to the ambush and slaughter of a 250 strong party led by British Acting Consul General James Phillips of the Niger Coast Protectorate. Rawson&#x27;s troops captured Benin City and the Kingdom of Benin was eventually absorbed into colonial Nigeria. The expedition freed about 100 Africans enslaved by the Oba.The aftermath of the expedition had significant impacts on the Kingdom of Benin, including the looting of cultural artifacts and the exile of the Oba.

== Background ==

At the end of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Benin had retained its independence during the Scramble for Africa, and the Oba of Benin exercised a monopoly over trade in Benin&#x27;s territories which the Royal Niger Company considered a threat. In 1892, Deputy Commissioner and Vice-Consul Captain Henry Lionel Galway (1859–1949) tried to negotiate a trade agreement with Oba Ovọnramwẹn Nọgbaisi (1888–1914) to allow for the free passage of goods through his territory and the development of the palm oil industry. Captain Gallwey (as his name was then spelled) pushed for British interests in the region, especially of the palm oil industry, by attempting to negotiate a free trade agreement with the Oba at the time. Later, Ralph Moor urged the Foreign Office to use whatever means to secure the signed treaty, up to and including force. Gallwey signed the treaty with the Oba and his chiefs which gave Britain legal justification for exerting greater influence in the region. The Oba was hesitant to sign the treaty. After the British consul Richard Burton visited Benin in 1862 he described it a place of &quot;gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death&quot;, a narrative which was publicized in Britain and increased pressure for the territory&#x27;s incorporation into the British Empire. The treaty itself does not explicitly mention anything about the &quot;bloody customs&quot; that Burton had written about, and instead includes a vague clause about ensuring &quot;the general progress of civilization&quot;. While the treaty granted free trade to British merchants operating in the Kingdom of Benin, the Oba persisted in requiring customs duties. Since Major (later Sir) Claude Maxwell Macdonald, the Consul General of the Oil River Protectorate authorities considered the treaty legal and binding, he deemed the Oba&#x27;s requirements a violation of the accord and thus a hostile act.

Some historians have suggested that humanitarian motivations were driving British foreign policy in the region. Others, such as Philip Igbafe, consider that the annexation of Benin was driven largely by economic designs. The treaty itself did not mention any goal that removed the &quot;bloody customs&quot; that Burton had written about.

In 1894, after the capture of Ebrohimi, the trading town of the chief Nana Olomu (the leading Itsekiri trader in the Benin River District) by a combined Royal Navy and Niger Coast Protectorate force, the Kingdom of Benin increased the military presence on its own southern borders. These developments combined with the Colonial Office&#x27;s refusal to grant approval for an invasion of Benin City scuttled an expedition the Protectorate had planned for early 1895. Even so, between September 1895 and mid-1896 three attempts were made by the Protectorate to enforce the Gallwey Treaty of 1892: firstly by Major P. Copland-Crawford, Vice-Consul of the Benin District; secondly by Ralph Frederick Locke, the Vice-Consul Assistant; and thirdly by Captain Arthur Maling, Commandant of the Niger Coast Protectorate Force detachment based in Sapele.

In March 1896, following price fixing and refusals by Itsekiri middle men to pay the required tributes, the Oba of Benin ordered a cessation of the supply of oil palm produce to them. The trade embargo brought trade in the Benin River region to a standstill, and the British merchants in the region appealed to the Protectorate&#x27;s Consul-General to &quot;open up&quot; Benin territories and to send the Oba (whom they claimed was an obstruction to their trading activities) into exile. In October 1896 the Acting Consul-General, James Robert Phillips, visited the Benin River District and met with the agents and traders, who convinced him that &quot;there is a future on the Benin River if Benin territories were opened&quot;.

== The Benin Massacre (January 1897) ==
In November 1896, Phillips, the Vice Consul of a trading post on the African coast, decided to meet with the Oba in Benin City in regards to the trade agreement that the Oba had made with the British but was not keeping. He formally asked his superiors in London for permission to visit Benin City, claiming that the costs of such an embassy would be recouped by trading for ivory. In late December 1896, without waiting for a reply or approval, Phillips embarked on an expedition comprising:
# James Robert Phillips, Acting Consul-General, Niger Coast Protectorate.
# Maj. Copland Crawford, Vice-Council of the Benin and Warri districts.
# Alan Boisragon, Commandant of the Constabulary of the Niger Coast Protectorate.
# Cap. Malling, Niger Coast Protectorate force.
# Elliot, Medical Officer for Sapele and Benin districts.
# Ralph Locke, District Commissioner of Warri.
# Kenneth Campbell, District Commissioner at Sapele.
# Mr Gordon, trader, Africa Association.
# Swainson, trader, of Mr. Pinnock&#x27;s firm.
# Mr Powis, agent for Millers Brothers palm oil, at Old Calabar.
# Mr Lyon, Assistant District commissioner at Sapele (waited Gwatto).
# Mr Baddoo (of Accara, Gold Coast), Consul-General&#x27;s Chief clerk and Photographer.
# Mr Jumbo, Consul-General&#x27;s orderly, and Civil Policeman.
# Mr , Vice-Council&#x27;s orderly, and Civil Policeman.
# Mr Towey, local interpreter.
# Mr Herbert Clarke, local interpreter.
# Mr Basilli, local Benin guide.
# Jim, Boisragon&#x27;s, Kru, manservant.
# 180 Jakri porters to carry their supplies, food, trade goods, presents, cameras, and tents.
# 60 Kru labourers.

Phillips had sent a message to the Oba, claiming that his present mission was to discuss trade and peace and demanding admission to the territory. Ahead of Phillips, he had sent an envoy bearing numerous gifts for trade. It was during this time that the Oba was celebrating Igue festival, and he sent word that he did not wish to see the British at the time, and he would send word in a month or two, when he was ready to receive just Phillips and one Jakri chief.

On 4 January 1897, Phillips and his entire party was ambushed along their journey to Benin City, at Ugbine village near Gwato. British officers and African porters were slaughtered. Only two British survived their wounds, Alan Boisragon and Ralph Locke. The Edo ambushers captured over 100 Itseriki porters hired by the British, and enslaved them in Benin. Within the week, news had made it to London of the massacre. This event led to the mounting of the Punitive Expedition.

As a result of this attack, the Foreign Office authorized military action, leading to the &quot;punitive expedition&quot;, the purported intention by Moor: »It is imperative that a most severe lesson be given the Kings, Chiefs, and JuJu men of all surrounding countries, that white men cannot be killed with impunity, and that human sacrifices, with the oppression of the weak and poor, must cease.« According to historian Philip Igbafe, the humanitarian and punitive justifications given by Moor ran counter to the economic justifications for military action that he and other members of the Protectorate administration promoted in the months and years before the events of February 1897.

The two British that survived the annihilation of Phillips&#x27; expedition, which became known as the &#x27;Benin Massacre&#x27;, were Captain Alan Maxwell Boisragon, Commandant of the Constabulary of the Niger Coast Protectorate, who had been shot in the right arm and knee, and Ralph Locke, District Commissioner of Warri, who had been shot four times in the arm, and once in the hip.

== The punitive expedition (February 1897) ==

On 12 January 1897, Rear-Admiral Harry Rawson, commander of the Royal Navy forces at the Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, was appointed by the Admiralty to lead a force to invade the Kingdom of Benin and capture the Benin Oba. The operation was named the Benin Punitive Expedition.

On 9 February 1897, the invasion of the Kingdom of Benin began. The British invasion force of about 1,200 Royal Marines, sailors and Niger Coast Protectorate Forces was organised into three columns: the &#x27;Sapoba&#x27;, &#x27;Gwato&#x27; and &#x27;Main&#x27; columns. Flotillas of warships (including HMS &quot;Philomel&quot; and &quot;Phoebe&quot;) and gunboats approached Benin City from the east and west. The &#x27;Sapoba&#x27; and &#x27;Main&#x27; columns reached Benin City after ten days of fighting. The &#x27;Gwato&#x27; column (under Captain Gallwey) took the same route as that taken by the previous mission and came on the scene of the massacre, finding headless bodies of the victims.

Elspeth Huxley spent some time researching in Benin in 1954, and wrote:&quot; ... to hear an account of the Benin massacre of 1897 and its sequel from one who had taken part. It is a story that still has power to amaze and horrify, as well as to remind us that the British had motives for pushing into Africa other than the intention to exploit the natives and glorify themselves. Here, for instance, are some extracts from the diary of a surgeon who took part in the expedition.:-

&#x27;As we neared Benin City we passed several human sacrifices, live women slaves gagged and pegged on their backs to the ground, the abdominal wall being cut in the form of a cross, and the uninjured gut hanging out. These poor women were allowed to die like this in the sun. Men slaves, with their hands tied at the back and feet lashed together, also gagged, were lying about. As we neared the city, sacrificed human beings were lying in the path and bush—even in the king&#x27;s compound the sight and stench of them was awful. Dead and mutilated bodies were everywhere – by God! May I never see such sights again! . . .&#x27;&quot;Herbert Walker, a soldier serving in the punitive expedition, believed that the human sacrifices he saw were an attempt by Benin City residents to appease the Gods as they tried to defend themselves from the expedition.

According to professor of African studies, Robin Law, the issue of human sacrifices is an extremely sensitive one and prone to bias. Law suggests that the reported extent of the practice in Benin was exaggerated by the British in order to establish the need for military intervention.

Eight members of the punitive force were recorded as being killed in action during the Benin Expedition; the number of military and civilian casualties amongst the Benin people was not estimated but is thought to have been very high.

The Benin Expedition was described as such:
:&quot;In twenty-nine days a force of 1,200 men, coming from three places between 3000 and 4500 m. from the Benin river, was landed, organized, equipped and provided with transport. Five days later the city of Benin was taken, and in twelve days more the men were re-embarked, and the ships coaled and ready for any further service.&quot;

All-in-all, around 5,000 men were mobilised for the expedition, which took place over three weeks.

== Aftermath ==
After the capture of Benin City, houses, sacred sites, ceremonial buildings and palaces of many high-ranking chiefs were looted and many buildings were burned down, including the Palace building itself on Sunday 21 February. There was evidence of previous human sacrifice found by members of the expedition, with journalists from Reuters and the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; reporting that the town &#x27;reeked of human blood.&#x27; Inside the abandoned palace, a terrible sight was revealed to the British. The Oba in panic of what he had done and in fear of a retaliatory attack, had embarked in a great mass of human sacrifice in order to stave off full disaster. Bodies of those sacrificed by the Oba laid in pits and many hung crucified in trees.

The Oba was eventually captured by the British consul-general, Ralph Moor. He was deposed and exiled, with two of his eighty wives, to Calabar. A British Resident was appointed, and six chiefs were hanged in Benin City&#x27;s marketplace.

Most of the plunder from the city was retained by the expedition with some 2,500 (official figures) religious artefacts, Benin visual history, mnemonics and artworks being sent to Britain. They include over a thousand metal plaques and sculptures collectively known as the Benin Bronzes. The Admiralty confiscated and auctioned off the war booty to defray the costs of the expedition.

About 40% of the art was accessioned to the British Museum, while other works were given to individual members of the armed forces as spoils of war, and the remainder was sold at auction by the Admiralty to pay for the expedition as early as May 1897 (Stevens Auction Rooms, 38 King Street, London, 25 May 1897; followed by several sales by the ethnographic dealer William Downing Webster, Bicester, between 1898 and 1900). Most of the Benin Bronzes sold at auction were purchased by museums, mainly in Germany. The dispersal of Benin artworks to museums around the world catalysed the beginnings of a long and slow European reassessment of the value of West African art. The Benin art was copied and the style integrated into the art of many European artists and thus had a strong influence on the early formation of modernism in Europe.

The British occupied Benin, which was absorbed into the British Niger Coast Protectorate and eventually into British colonial Nigeria. A general emancipation of slaves followed in the wake of British occupation, and with it came an end to human sacrifice. However, the British instituted a system of drafting locals to work as forced labourers in often poor conditions that were not much better than had been during the previous Benin Empire.

== Controversy ==
There has much debate of why James Phillips set out on the mission to Benin without much weaponry. Some have argued he was going on a peaceful mission. Such commentators argue that the message from the Oba that his festival would not permit him to receive European visitors touched the humanitarian side of Phillips&#x27;s character because of an assumption that the festival included human sacrifice. According to Igbafe, this does not explain why Phillips set out before he had received a reply from the Foreign Office to his request where he stated that:

Igbafe also points to Phillips&#x27; November 1896 advocacy of military force regarding Benin, arguing that this is inconsistent with the perception of Phillips as a man of peace in January 1897. Igbafe posits that Phillips was going on a reconnaissance mission and that Phillips&#x27; haste to Benin can be explained by a belief that nothing bad would happen to him or his party.

Phillips&#x27;s journey has been described by Mona Zutshi Opubor as a period of lull before the outbreak of a violent storm which had been gathering for years with the pressure of traders, consuls and a few visits of armed Europeans to the Benin Empire. The suspicion among the Oba of Benin, therefore, only deepened with Phillips&#x27;s mission. The previous deportations of the Jaja of Opobo in 1887 and Nana Olomu in 1894 in neighboring British controlled territories may have made the Benin Empire anxious about safety of their Oba and the true intentions of the British. According to Igbafe, evidence at the Oba&#x27;s trial in September 1897, showed that the people of Benin Empire did not believe that Phillips&#x27; party had peaceful intentions, since the capture of Nana, there had been a long expectation of war in Benin.

== Movement for repatriation of objects taken as war booty==
In 2017 a cockerel statue or &quot;okukor&quot; looted during the 1897 Benin Expedition was removed from the hall of Jesus College, Cambridge, following protests by students of the university. Jesus College&#x27;s student union passed a motion declaring that the sculpture should be returned. A spokesperson from the university stated that &quot;Jesus College acknowledges the contribution made by students in raising the important but complex question of the rightful location of its Benin bronze, in response to which it has removed the &quot;okukor&quot; from its hall&quot; and that the university is willing &quot;to discuss and determine the best future for the &quot;okukor&quot;, including the question of repatriation. On 27 October 2021, the okukor was received by Nigeria&#x27;s National Commission for Museums and Monuments in a Benin Bronze Restitution Ceremony held and livestreamed by Jesus College.

The University of Aberdeen became the first institution to agree to the full repatriation of a Benin Bronze from a museum in March 2021 and handed back a bronze sculpture, depicting the head of an Oba, to the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments on 28 October 2021. It had been purchased by the university at an auction in 1957 and was identified as a Benin bronze in a recent collections review.

Current day policy of the Nigerian government see all repatriated Benin Bronzes turned over to the ownership of Ewuare II, the current Oba of Benin and direct descendant of the ruler of Benin overthrown by the British in 1897. Many descendants of the freed slaves still remain in the Benin area today and thus returning the Benin Bronzes to the descendant of the ruler enriched by their slave trading and human sacrifice has caused much controversy nationally and internationally.

<text>Factoring is a financial transaction and a type of debtor finance in which a business &quot;sells&quot; its accounts receivable (i.e., invoices) to a third party (called a factor) at a discount. A business will sometimes factor its receivable assets to meet its present and immediate cash needs. Forfaiting is a factoring arrangement used in international trade finance by exporters who wish to sell their receivables to a forfaiter. Factoring is commonly referred to as accounts receivable factoring, invoice factoring, and sometimes accounts receivable financing. Accounts receivable financing is a term more accurately used to describe a form of asset based lending against accounts receivable. The Commercial Finance Association is the leading trade association of the asset-based lending and factoring industries.

In the United States, factoring is not the same as &quot;invoice discounting&quot; (which is called an &quot;assignment of accounts receivable&quot; in American accounting – as propagated by FASB within GAAP). Factoring is the &quot;sale&quot; of receivables, whereas invoice discounting (&quot;assignment of accounts receivable&quot; in American accounting) is a &quot;borrowing&quot; that involves the use of the accounts receivable assets as collateral for the loan. However, in some other markets, such as the UK, invoice discounting is considered to be a form of factoring, involving the &quot;assignment of receivables&quot;, that is included in official factoring statistics. It is therefore also not considered to be borrowing in the UK. In the UK the arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of the factor. In the UK, the main difference between factoring and invoice discounting is confidentiality. Scottish law differs from that of the rest of the UK, in that notification to the account debtor is required for the assignment to take place. The Scottish Law Commission reviewed this position and made proposals to the Scottish Ministers in 2018.

==Overview==
There are three parties directly involved: the &quot;factor&quot; who purchases the receivable, the one who sells the receivable, and the debtor who has a financial liability that requires him or her to make a payment to the owner of the invoice. The receivable, usually associated with an invoice for work performed or goods sold, is essentially a financial asset that gives the owner of the receivable the legal right to collect money from the debtor whose financial liability directly corresponds to the receivable asset. The seller &quot;sells&quot; the receivables at a discount to the third party, the specialized financial organization (aka the factor) to obtain cash. This process is sometimes used in manufacturing industries when the immediate need for raw material outstrips their available cash and ability to purchase &quot;on account&quot;. Both invoice discounting and &quot;factoring&quot; are used by B2B companies to ensure they have the immediate cash flow necessary to meet their current and immediate obligations. Invoice factoring is not a relevant financing option for retail or B2C companies because they generally do not have business or commercial clients, a necessary condition for factoring.

The &quot;sale&quot; of the receivable transfers ownership of the receivable to the factor, indicating the factor obtains all of the rights associated with the receivables. Accordingly, the receivable becomes the factor&#x27;s asset, and the factor obtains the right to receive the payments made by the debtor for the invoice amount, and is free to pledge or exchange the receivable asset without unreasonable constraints or restrictions. Usually, the account debtor is notified of the sale of the receivable, and the factor bills the debtor and makes all collections; however, non-notification factoring, where the client (seller) collects the accounts sold to the factor, as agent of the factor, also occurs. The arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of the factor. If the factoring transfers the receivable &quot;without recourse&quot;, the factor (purchaser of the receivable) must bear the loss if the account debtor does not pay the invoice amount. If the factoring transfers the receivable &quot;with recourse&quot;, the factor has the right to collect the unpaid invoice amount from the transferor (seller). However, any merchandise returns that may diminish the invoice amount that is collectible from the accounts receivable are typically the responsibility of the seller, and the factor will typically hold back paying the seller for a portion of the receivable being &quot;sold&quot; (the &quot;factor&#x27;s holdback receivable&quot;) in order to cover the merchandise returns associated with the factored receivables until the privilege to return the merchandise expires.

There are four principal parts to the factoring transaction, all of which are recorded separately by an accountant who is responsible for recording the factoring transaction:
# the &quot;fee&quot; paid to the factor,
# the Interest Expense paid to the factor for the advance of money,
# the &quot;bad debt expense&quot; associated with portion of the receivables that the seller expects will remain unpaid and uncollectable,
# the &quot;factor&#x27;s holdback receivable&quot; amount to cover merchandise returns, and (e) any additional &quot;&quot;loss&quot; or &quot;gain&quot;&quot; the seller must attribute to the sale of the receivables. Sometimes the factor&#x27;s charges paid by the seller (the factor&#x27;s &quot;client&quot;) covers a discount fee, additional credit risk the factor must assume, and other services provided. The factor&#x27;s overall profit is the difference between the price it paid for the invoice and the money received from the debtor, less the amount lost due to non-payment.

==Rationale==
Factoring is a method used by some firms to obtain cash. Certain companies factor accounts when the available cash balance held by the firm is insufficient to meet current obligations and accommodate its other cash needs, such as new orders or contracts; in other industries, however, such as textiles or apparel, for example, financially sound companies factor their accounts simply because this is the historic method of financing. The use of factoring to obtain the cash needed to accommodate a firm&#x27;s immediate cash needs will allow the firm to maintain a smaller ongoing cash balance. By reducing the size of its cash balances, more money is made available for investment in the firm&#x27;s growth.

Debt factoring is also used as a financial instrument to provide better cash flow control especially if a company currently has a lot of accounts receivables with different credit terms to manage. A company sells its invoices at a discount to their face value when it calculates that it will be better off using the proceeds to bolster its own growth than it would be by effectively functioning as its &quot;customer&#x27;s bank.&quot; Accordingly, factoring occurs when the rate of return on the proceeds invested in production exceed the costs associated with factoring the receivables. Therefore, the trade-off between the return the firm earns on investment in production and the cost of utilizing a factor is crucial in determining both the extent factoring is used and the quantity of cash the firm holds on hand.

Many businesses have cash flow that varies. It might be relatively large in one period, and relatively small in another period. Because of this, businesses find it necessary to both maintain a cash balance on hand, and to use such methods as factoring, in order to enable them to cover their short term cash needs in those periods in which these needs exceed the cash flow. Each business must then decide how much it wants to depend on factoring to cover short falls in cash, and how large a cash balance it wants to maintain in order to ensure it has enough cash on hand during periods of low cash flow.

Generally, the variability in the cash flow will determine the size of the cash balance a business will tend to hold as well as the extent it may have to depend on such financial mechanisms as factoring. Cash flow variability is directly related to two factors:
# The extent cash flow can change, and
# The length of time cash flow can remain at a below average level.

If cash flow can decrease drastically, the business will find it needs large amounts of cash from either existing cash balances or from a factor to cover its obligations during this period of time. Likewise, the longer a relatively low cash flow can last, the more cash is needed from another source (cash balances or a factor) to cover its obligations during this time. As indicated, the business must balance the opportunity cost of losing a return on the cash that it could otherwise invest, against the costs associated with the use of factoring.

The cash balance a business holds is essentially a demand for transactions money. As stated, the size of the cash balance the firm decides to hold is directly related to its unwillingness to pay the costs necessary to use a factor to finance its short term cash needs. The problem faced by the business in deciding the size of the cash balance it wants to maintain on hand is similar to the decision it faces when it decides how much physical inventory it should maintain. In this situation, the business must balance the cost of obtaining cash proceeds from a factor against the opportunity cost of the losing the Rate of Return it earns on investment within its business. The solution to the problem is:

:formula_1

where
* formula_2 is the cash balance
* formula_3 is the average &quot;negative&quot; cash flow in a given period
* formula_4 is the [discount rate] that cover the factoring costs
* formula_5 is the rate of return on the firm&#x27;s assets.
Today factoring&#x27;s rationale still includes the financial task of advancing funds to smaller rapidly growing firms who sell to larger more credit-worthy organizations. While almost never taking possession of the goods sold, factors offer various combinations of money and supportive services when advancing funds.

Factors often provide their clients four key services: information on the creditworthiness of their prospective customers domestic and international, and, in nonrecourse factoring, acceptance of the credit risk for &quot;approved&quot; accounts; maintain the history of payments by customers (i.e., accounts receivable ledger); daily management reports on collections; and, make the actual collection calls. The outsourced credit function both extends the small firm&#x27;s effective addressable marketplace and insulates it from the survival-threatening destructive impact of a bankruptcy or financial difficulty of a major customer. A second key service is the operation of the accounts receivable function. The services eliminate the need and cost for permanent skilled staff found within large firms. Although today even they are outsourcing such back-office functions. More importantly, these services insure entrepreneurs and owners against a major source of a liquidity crises and their equity.

== Process ==
The factoring process can be broken up into two parts: the initial account setup and ongoing funding. Setting up a factoring account typically takes one to two weeks and involves submitting an application, a list of clients, an accounts receivable aging report and a sample invoice. The approval process involves detailed underwriting, during which time the factoring company can ask for additional documents, such as documents of incorporation, financials, and banks statements. If approved, the business will be set up with a maximum credit line from which they can draw. In the case of notification factoring, the arrangement is not confidential and approval is contingent upon successful notification; a process by which factoring companies send the business&#x27;s client or account debtor a Notice of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment serves to
# inform debtors that a factoring company is managing all of the business&#x27;s receivables,
# stake a claim on the financial rights for the receivables factored, and
# update the payment address – usually a bank lock box.

Once the account is set up, the business is ready to start funding invoices. Invoices are still approved on an individual basis, but most invoices can be funded in a business day or two, as long as they meet the factor&#x27;s criteria. Receivables are funded in two parts. The first part is the &quot;advance&quot; and covers 80% to 85% of the invoice value. This is deposited directly to the business&#x27;s bank account. The remaining 15% to 20% is rebated, less the factoring fees, as soon as the invoice is paid in full to the factoring company.

==Accounts receivable discounting ==
Non-recourse factoring should not be confused with making a loan. When a lender decides to extend credit to a company based on assets, cash flows, and credit history, the borrower must recognize a liability to the lender, and the lender recognizes the borrower&#x27;s promise to repay the loan as an asset. Factoring without recourse is a &quot;sale&quot; of a financial asset (the receivable), in which the factor assumes ownership of the asset and all of the risks associated with it, and the &quot;seller&quot; relinquishes any title to the asset &quot;sold&quot;. An example of factoring is the credit card. Factoring is like a credit card where the bank (factor) is buying the debt of the customer without recourse to the seller; if the buyer doesn&#x27;t pay the amount to the seller the bank cannot claim the money from the seller or the merchant, just as the bank in this case can only claim the money from the debt issuer. Factoring is different from invoice discounting, which usually doesn&#x27;t imply informing the debt issuer about the assignment of debt, whereas in the case of factoring the debt issuer is usually notified in what is known as notification factoring. One more difference between the factoring and invoice discounting is that in case of factoring the seller assigns all receivables of a certain buyer(s) to the factor whereas in invoice discounting the borrower (the seller) assigns a receivable balance, not specific invoices. A factor is therefore more concerned with the credit-worthiness of the company&#x27;s customers. The factoring transaction is often structured as a purchase of a financial asset, namely the accounts receivable. A non-recourse factor assumes the &quot;credit risk&quot; that an account will not collect due solely to the financial inability of account debtor to pay. In the United States, if the factor does not assume the credit risk on the purchased accounts, in most cases a court will recharacterize the transaction as a secured loan.

When a company decides to factors account receivables invoices to a principles factors or broker, it needs to understands the risks and rewards involved with factoring. Amount of funding can vary depending on the specific accounts receivables, debtor and industry that factoring occurs in. Factors can limit and restrict funding in such occasions where the debtor is found not credit worthy, or the invoice amount represents too big of a portion of the business&#x27;s annual income. Another area of concern is when the cost of invoice factoring is calculated. It&#x27;s a compound of an administration charge and interest earned overtime as the debtor takes time to repay the original invoice. Not all factoring companies charge interest over the time it takes to collect from a debtor, in this case only the administration charge needs to be taken into account although this type of facility is comparatively rare. There are major industries which stand out in the factoring industry which are:

1. Distribution
2. Retail
3. Manufacturing
4. Transportation
5. Services
6. Construction

However, most businesses can apply invoice factoring successfully to their funding model.

== Common factoring terms ==

=== Discount rate or factoring fee ===
The discount rate is the fee a factoring company charges to provide the factoring service. Since a formal factoring transaction involves the outright purchase of the invoice, the discount rate is typically stated as a percentage of the face value of the invoices. For instance, a factoring company may charge 5% for an invoice due in 45 days. In contrast, companies that do accounts receivable financing may charge per week or per month. Thus, an invoice financing company that charges 1% per week would result in a discount rate of 6–7% for the same invoice.

=== Advance rate ===
The advance rate is the percentage of an invoice that is paid out by the factoring company upfront. The difference between the face value of the invoice and the advance rates serves to protect factors against any losses and to ensure coverage for their fees. Once the invoice is paid, the factor gives the difference between the face value, advance amount and fees back to the business in the form of a factoring rebate.

=== Reserve account ===
Whereas the difference between the invoice face value and the advance serves as a reserve for a specific invoice, many factors also hold an ongoing reserve account which serves to further reduce the risk for the factoring company. This reserve account is typically 10–15% of the seller&#x27;s credit line, but not all factoring companies hold reserve accounts.

=== Long-term contracts and minimums ===
While factoring fees and terms range widely, many factoring companies will have monthly minimums and require a long-term contract as a measure to guarantee a profitable relationship. Although shorter contract periods are now becoming more common, contracts and monthly minimums are typical with &quot;whole ledger&quot; factoring, which entails factoring all of a company&#x27;s invoices or all of the company&#x27;s invoices from a particular debtor.

=== Spot factoring ===
Spot factoring, or single invoice discounting, is an alternative to &quot;whole ledger&quot; and allows a company to factor a single invoice. The added flexibility for the business, and lack of predictable volume and monthly minimums for factoring providers means that spot factoring transactions usually carry a cost premium.

==Treatment under GAAP==
In the United States, under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), receivables are considered &quot;sold&quot;, under FASB ASC 860-10 (or under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, paragraph 112), when the buyer has &quot;no recourse&quot;. Moreover, to treat the transaction as a sale under GAAP, the seller&#x27;s monetary liability under any &quot;recourse&quot; provision must be readily estimated at the time of the sale. Otherwise, the financial transaction is treated as a secured loan, with the receivables used as collateral.

When a nonrecourse transaction takes place, the accounts receivable balance is removed from the statement of financial position. The corresponding debits include the expense recorded on the income statement and the proceeds received from the factor.

==History==
Factoring as a fact of business life was underway in England prior to 1400, and it came to America with the Pilgrims, around 1620. It appears to be closely related to early merchant banking activities. The latter however evolved by extension to non-trade related financing such as sovereign debt. Like all financial instruments, factoring evolved over centuries. This was driven by changes in the organization of companies; technology, particularly air travel and non-face-to-face communications technologies starting with the telegraph, followed by the telephone and then computers. These also drove and were driven by modifications of the common law framework in England and the United States.

Governments were latecomers to the facilitation of trade financed by factors. English common law originally held that unless the debtor was notified, the assignment between the seller of invoices and the factor was not valid. The Canadian Federal Government legislation governing the assignment of moneys owed by it still reflects this stance as does provincial government legislation modelled after it. As late as the current century, the courts have heard arguments that without notification of the debtor the assignment was not valid. In the United States, by 1949 the majority of state governments had adopted a rule that the debtor did not have to be notified, thus opening up the possibility of non-notification factoring arrangements.

Originally the industry took physical possession of the goods, provided cash advances to the producer, financed the credit extended to the buyer and insured the credit strength of the buyer. In England the control over the trade thus obtained resulted in an Act of Parliament in 1696 to mitigate the monopoly power of the factors. With the development of larger firms who built their own sales forces, distribution channels, and knowledge of the financial strength of their customers, the needs for factoring services were reshaped and the industry became more specialized.

By the twentieth century in the United States factoring was still the predominant form of financing working capital for the then-high-growth-rate textile industry. In part this occurred because of the structure of the US banking system with its myriad of small banks and consequent limitations on the amount that could be advanced prudently by any one of them to a firm. In Canada, with its national banks the limitations were far less restrictive and thus factoring did not develop as widely as in the US. Even then, factoring also became the dominant form of financing in the Canadian textile industry.

By the first decade of the 21st century, a basic public policy rationale for factoring remains that the product is well-suited to the demands of innovative, rapidly growing firms critical to economic growth. A second public policy rationale is allowing fundamentally good business to be spared the costly, time-consuming trials and tribulations of bankruptcy protection for suppliers, employees and customers or to provide a source of funds during the process of restructuring the firm so that it can survive and grow.

==Modern forms==
In the latter half of the twentieth century the introduction of computers eased the accounting burdens of factors and then small firms. The same occurred for their ability to obtain information about debtor&#x27;s creditworthiness. Introduction of the Internet and the web has accelerated the process while reducing costs. Today credit information and insurance coverage are instantly available online. The web has also made it possible for factors and their clients to collaborate in real time on collections. Acceptance of signed documents provided by facsimile as being legally binding has eliminated the need for physical delivery of &quot;originals&quot;, thereby reducing time delays for entrepreneurs.

Traditionally, factoring has been a relationship driven business and factoring transactions have been largely manual and frequently involving a face to-face component as part of the relationship building process or due-diligence phase. This is especially true for small business factoring, in which the factoring companies tend to be locally or regionally focused. The geographic focus helps them better mitigate risks that because of their smaller scale, they otherwise couldn&#x27;t afford to take.

To make the arrangement economically profitable, most factoring companies have revenue minimums (e.g. at least $500,000 in annual revenue) and require annual contracts and monthly minimums. More recently, several online factoring companies have emerged, leveraging aggregation, analytics, automation to deliver the benefits of factoring with the convenience and ease afforded by the internet. Some companies use technology to automate some of the risk and back-office aspects of factoring and provide the service via a modern web interface for additional convenience. This enables them to serve a broader range of small businesses with significantly lower revenue requirements without the need for monthly minimums and long-term contracts. Many of these companies have direct software integrations with software programs such as Quickbooks, allowing businesses to immediately receive funding without an application.

The emergence of these modern forms has not been without controversy. Critics accurately point out that none of these new players have experienced a complete credit cycle and thus, their underwriting models have not been market tested by an economic contraction. What&#x27;s more, some of these new models rely on a market place lending format. It&#x27;s unclear if this source of capital will be stable over time, as other companies, most notably, Lending Club, had a difficult time attracting investors in early 2016, even though net returns seem higher on invoice finance platforms such as MarketInvoice and FundThrough than on business loan platforms such as Funding Circle.

== Specialized factoring ==
With advances in technology, some invoice factoring providers have adapted to specific industries. This often affects additional services offered by the factor in order to best adapt the factoring service to the needs of the business. An example of this includes a recruitment specialist factor offering payroll and back office support with the factoring facility; a wholesale or /distribution factor may not offer this additional service. These differences can affect the cost of the facility, the approach the factor takes when collecting credit, the administration services included in the facility and the maximum size of invoices which can be factored.

=== Real estate ===
Since the 2007 United States recession one of the fastest-growing sectors in the factoring industry is real estate commission advances. Commission advances work the same way as factoring but are done with licensed real estate agents on their pending and future real estate commissions. Commission advances were first introduced in Canada but quickly spread to the United States. Typically, the process consists of an online application from a real estate agent, who signs a contract selling future commissions at a discount; the factoring company then wires the funds to the agent&#x27;s bank account.

=== Medical factoring ===
The healthcare industry makes for a special case in which factoring is much needed because of long payment cycles from government, private insurance companies and other third party payers, but difficult because of HIPAA requirements. For this reasons medical receivables factoring companies have developed to specifically target this niche.

=== Construction ===
Factoring is commonplace in the construction industry because of the long payment cycles that can stretch to 120 days and beyond. However, the construction industry has features that are risky for factoring companies. Because of the risks and exposure from mechanics&#x27; liens, danger of &quot;paid-when-paid&quot; terms, existence of progress billing, use of withholding, and exposure to economic cycles most &quot;generalist&quot; factoring companies avoid construction receivables entirely. That has created another niche of factoring companies that specialize in construction receivables.

=== Haulage ===
Factoring is often used by haulage companies to cover upfront expenses, such as fuel. Factoring companies that cater to this niche offer services to help accommodate drivers on the road, including the ability to verify invoices and fund on copies sent via scan, fax or email, and the option to place the funds directly onto a fuel card, which works like a debit card. Haulage factors also offer fuel advance programs that provide a cash advance to carriers upon confirmed pickup of the load.

=== Recruitment ===
In the recruitment sector factoring is an effective solution, often used by temporary recruitment agencies who must ensure that their business has the available funds each week to make payment to the workers they have placed.

==Invoice payers (debtors)==
Large firms and organizations such as governments usually have specialized processes to deal with one aspect of factoring, redirection of payment to the factor following receipt of notification from the third party (i.e., the factor) to whom they will make the payment. Many but not all in such organizations are knowledgeable about the use of factoring by small firms and clearly distinguish between its use by small rapidly growing firms and turnarounds.

Distinguishing between assignment of the responsibility to perform the work and the assignment of funds to the factor is central to the customer or debtor&#x27;s processes. Firms have purchased from a supplier for a reason and thus insist on that firm fulfilling the work commitment. Once the work has been performed, however, it is a matter of indifference who is paid. For example, General Electric has clear processes to be followed which distinguish between their work and payment sensitivities. Contracts direct with the US government require an assignment of claims, which is an amendment to the contract allowing for payments to third parties (factors).

==Risks==
Risks to a factor include:
* Counter-party credit risk related to clients and risk-covered debtors. Risk-covered debtors can be reinsured, which limit the risks of a factor. Trade receivables are a fairly low-risk asset due to their short duration.
* External fraud by clients: fake invoicing, misdirected payments, pre-invoicing, not assigned credit notes, etc. A fraud insurance policy and subjecting the client to audit could limit the risks.
* Legal, compliance and tax risks: large number of applicable laws and regulations in different countries
* Operational risks, such as contractual disputes
* Uniform Commercial Code (UCC-1) securing rights to assets.
* IRS liens associated with payroll taxes, etc.
* ICT risks: complicated, integrated factoring system, extensive data exchange with client

==Reverse factoring==

In reverse factoring or supply-chain finance, the buyer sells its debt to the factor. That way, the buyer secures the financing of the invoice, and the supplier gets a better interest rate.

<text>Inks Lake is a reservoir on the Colorado River in the Texas Hill Country in the United States. The reservoir was formed in 1938 by the construction of Inks Dam by the Lower Colorado River Authority. Located near Burnet, Texas, the lake serves to provide flood control in tandem with Lake Buchanan and features the smallest hydroelectric power plant on the Highland Lakes chain. Inks Lake was named for Roy B. Inks, one of the original board members of the Lower Colorado River Authority, and serves as a venue for outdoor recreation, including fishing, boating, swimming, camping, and picnicking.

The other reservoirs on the Colorado River are Lake Buchanan, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, Lake Austin, and Lady Bird Lake.

== Fish and wildlife populations ==

Inks Lake has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Inks Lake include largemouth bass, white bass, catfish, crappie, and sunfish. Inks Lake is a level-controlled reservoir with less than one foot (one third meter) variation in water level annually.

== Recreational uses ==

Some of the property bordering Inks Lake is privately owned. Inks Lake State Park is adjacent to the lake and includes facilities for camping, backpacking, swimming, golf, and boat access. Cliff jumping is another water activity locals and visitors enjoy at &quot;Devil&#x27;s Water Hole&quot; located within the confines of Inks Lake State Park on Inks Lake. In the 1990s and early 2000s, a fish restaurant was permanently moored adjacent to an RV park on a barge. The restaurant is closed, however the RV park remains. Camp Longhorn, a summer camp for boys and girls founded by Tex Robertson in 1939, is adjacent to the lake.

<doc id="317813" wikidata="Q733984" url="?curid=317813" title="Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria">
<text>Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria also called Abba Kyrillos VI, ; (2 August 1902 – 9 March 1971; 26 Epip 1618 – 30 Meshir 1687) was the 116th Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St. Mark from 10 May 1959 (2 Pashons 1675) to his death.

==Early life==
Pope Cyril VI was born as Azer Youssef Atta in Damanhour, Egypt, into a Coptic Orthodox middle-class family, the son of a deacon. He resigned from a civil service position to become a monk in July 1927 (Paoni–Epip 1643). He passed his probationary period and, on 24 February 1928 (21 Meshir 1644), took his monastic vows at the Paromeos Monastery, assuming the name of Father Mina el-Baramosy (Father Mina of the Paromeos Monastery). He was also known as Father Mina the Elder.

After helping to resolve a conflict between the abbot of El Baramous monastery and some of its elder monks, he requested from Pope John XIX of Alexandria to live in one of the windmills built in Old Cairo during the reign of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. He spent the start of his time in the windmill with no doors or a roof out of love for solitude. He was then pressured by the priests and an &quot;Archon&quot; (lay-leader) of a nearby church to renovate the windmill in order to be a more suitable environment to live. The ground floor served as a place for Fr Mina to live and the upper level he placed a sanctuary with an altar to pray daily liturgies in. He stayed in the windmill for some time before his relocation to the Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confessor. After his death, a church was built around the windmill.

In 1944 he was nominated to become the abbot of the Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confessor and played a vital role in building a centre for the monastery in El Zawra, renovating the ancient churches of the monastery and building new monk cells.

In 1947 (1663–1664), Father Mina built the Church of Saint Mina in Cairo. He also used to pray in the Church of the Holy Virgin in Babylon El-Darag before assuming the papacy.

==Coptic Pope==

Father Mina became Pope of Alexandria on 10 May 1959 (2 Pashons 1675). In accordance with the old Coptic church tradition, Pope Cyril VI was the only monk in the 20th century A.D./17th century A.M. to be chosen for papacy without having been a bishop /Metropolitan first. Before him, there were three bishops / Metropolitans who became Popes of Alexandria: Pope John XIX (1928–1942), Pope Macarius III (1942–1944) and Pope Joseph II (1946–1956). After him, Pope Shenouda III was also a bishop before becoming Pope.

During his enthronement ceremony, he addressed the people of the Coptic Church with the following words:But as for you, I hope to open my heart to you, that you might perceive the deep love for all therein; this is the love that emanates from the heart of our Saviour who loved us and redeemed us with His Blood. And so, I beseech all of you to persist in raising prayers for the safety of the Church and for my weakness, and for all the labouring servants.

In November 1959, he laid the foundation stone of the new Monastery of Saint Mina in the Desert of Mariout.

Cyril&#x27;s papacy also marked the alleged apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Zeitoun, Egypt (starting on 2 April 1968/24 [Paremhat 1684]).

The Seat of Pope Cyril VI was initially located in Saint Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Azbakeya, Cairo. However, in 1968 he built the Saint Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Abbasseya, also in Cairo, which replaced it. Its inauguration was attended by Egyptian President Nasser, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, and delegates from most other churches.

In June 1968 (Pashons–Paoni 1684), Pope Cyril received the relics of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Apostle, which had been taken from Alexandria to Venice over eleven centuries earlier. The relics were interred beneath the newly completed cathedral.

Pope Cyril died on 9 March 1971 (30 Meshir 1687), after a short illness. His funeral was held in the Saint Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Abbasseya. He was buried in a temporary tomb under the altar of the cathedral. His body was then relocated according to his will to the Monastery of Saint Mina in Mariut by Pope Shenouda III in November 1971. Pope Shenouda III spoke about his predecessor: &quot;There is no man in all the history of the church like Pope Cyril VI, who was able to pray so many liturgies. He prayed more than 12,000 liturgies. This matter never happened before in the history of the Popes of Alexandria or the world, or even among the monks. He was wondrous in his prayers.&quot; On 20 June 2013 (13 Paoni 1729), 42 years after his death, he was canonised as a saint by the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church.

==Inter-Church relations==

Pope Cyril VI elevated the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church to the title of Patriarch-Catholicos. Abuna Basilios, who was the first Ethiopian to be appointed Archbishop of Ethiopia by Pope Joseph II, became Ethiopia&#x27;s first Patriarch. Pope Cyril VI was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Star of Solomon by Emperor Haile Selassie in gratitude.

In January 1965 (Koiak–Tobi 1681), Pope Cyril VI presided over the Committee of Oriental Orthodox Churches in Addis Ababa, the first non-Chalcedonian ecumenical synod of these churches held in modern times.

<text>Little Plum (full name revealed to be Little Plum Stealing Varmint) is a British comedy western comics series about a little Native American, originally created by Leo Baxendale and published in the magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;.

==Concept==

The eponymous hero and his friends Chiefy, Little Peach, Pimple and Hole-in-um-Head are members of the &quot;Smellyfeet&quot; American Indian tribe, who spend much of their time clashing with their rivals the &quot;Puttyfeet&quot; tribe. Other characters include Dr. Kildeer (the tribal medicine man), Treaclefoot (Plum&#x27;s faithful horse) and Pudding Bison (a &#x27;marvellous&#x27; creature who eats anything – also featuring in spin-off strips Baby Face Finlayson and The Three Bears).

==Character history==

===Original run (1953–1998)===
Leo Baxendale created Little Plum in 1953 as a puny cartoon character in a dangerous cartoon world. It first appeared in issue 586, dated 10 October 1953. The comic strip employed a caricature of English language spoken by American Indians, notably replacing the word &quot;the&quot; with &quot;um&quot;. Baxendale dreamed him up claiming he was a mixture of Hiawatha and Dennis the Menace and gave him into the editing team. Unsure of the name, Baxendale gave it in to the then &quot;Beano&quot; editor under the working title &#x27;Booster&#x27; before the strip was officially titled &#x27;Little Plum, Your Redskin Chum&#x27; . They consisted of Plum, a ten-year-old member of the Smellyfoot tribe and the misadventures he got up to trying to prove himself a valuable member. After Baxendale left &quot;The Beano&quot; in 1962, Robert Nixon drew a few strips before Ron Spencer took over that same year. The strip originally finished in 1986, but it continued to appear in the Beano annuals up to 1994, and reappeared for a short time in 1998 under the name &#x27;The Legend of Little Plum&#x27;, drawn by Tom Paterson.

===Hunt Emerson strips and later history (2002 – 2015)===
From 2002 it has returned again under its original name, drawn by Hunt Emerson. The strip was finally dropped in 2006 when Hunt Emerson started drawing Ratz, though he has since appeared in BeanoMAX and in the 2009 Beano Annual. In Issue 3566, Little Plum returned to the comic once again, as reprints of Hunt Emerson&#x27;s strips. However, all uses of the word &quot;um&quot; present when the strips originally appeared were removed in the reprinted versions. In autumn 2012, a new feature launched in the Beano called Funsize Funnies, each page of which features four single line strips. One of these is Little Plum, drawn by Laura Howell. Some episodes are written and drawn by Andy Fanton, an ex-Dandy artist. After a brief absence, Little Plum returned to The Beano every week as a 6 panel half page strip, drawn by Hunt Emerson and written by ex-Dandy artist Stu Munro after the pair collaborated on a revival of The Nibblers. The final weekly appearance of Little Plum ran in February 2015 with a full page strip parodying The Gruffalo. The character was then officially retired.

==Other appearances==
* Little Plum was parodied in the bawdy comic magazine &quot;Viz&quot; with their character &quot;Little Plumber&quot;.

<doc id="317815" wikidata="Q887176" url="?curid=317815" title="Oba of Benin">
<text>The Oba of Benin is the traditional ruler and the custodian of the culture of the Edo people and all Edoid people. The then Kingdom of Benin (not to be confused with the modern-day and unrelated Republic of Benin, which was then known as Dahomey) has continued to be mostly populated by the Edo (also known as Benin ethnic group).

In 1897, a British military force of approximately 1,200 men under the command of Sir Harry Rawson mounted the Benin punitive Expedition. The force was dispatched in retaliation to the ambush of a British party, at Ugbine village near Gwato on 4 January 1897 by a group of Benin soldiers who were acting without orders from the Oba; the ambush had led to the deaths of all but two of the British party. The British force captured the capital of the Kingdom of Benin, sacking and burning the city while forcing the Oba of Benin, Ovonramwen, into a six-month exile. The expeditionary force consisted of both indigenous soldiers and British officers based in colonial-era Nigeria. Numerous artworks (collectively known as the Benin Bronzes) looted from the city palace were sold off to defray the costs of the expedition. Ovonramwen died in 1914, his throne never having been restored to him. His son, grandson and now his great-grandson, however, has preserved their title and status as traditional rulers in modern-day Nigeria.

<doc id="317820" wikidata="Q7814706" url="?curid=317820" title="Tom, Dick and Sally">
<text>Tom, Dick and Sally was a comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot; between issue 1735 (dated 18 October 1975) and 2305 (20 September 1986). It was initially drawn by Dave Jenner, but Keith Reynolds drew it for much of its run. Robert Nixon is also known to have drawn a number of episodes. Tom and Dick repeatedly tried to offload their responsibilities onto their younger sister Sally, and enjoy an easy life at her expense. They nearly always failed and ended up worse-off than when they started. However, sometimes Sally lets them have the last laugh.

The pop group Madness once appeared as themselves in a strip as did singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading. Singer Tom Jones and TV presenter Dickie Davies have also received mentions.

The strip is named after the phrase Tom, Dick and Harry. There was also a strip in The Beezer called &quot;Pop, Dick and Harry&quot;.

In 2014, Tom, Dick and Sally returned to The Beano as part of the Funsize Funnies drawn by Steve Beckett

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 415. It is situated approximately west from Grantham, and adjoins the county border with Leicestershire. The neighbouring village of Belvoir lies on the other side of the border. Grantham Canal is situated to the north-east at its closest point.

==History==

=== Etymology ===
According to &quot;A Dictionary of British Place Names&quot;, the name Woolsthorpe means &quot;an outlying farmstead or hamlet (Old Scandinavian &#x27;thorp&#x27;) of a man called Wulfstan (Old English person name)&quot;.

=== Early history ===
In the 1086 &quot;Domesday&quot; account Woolsthorpe is referred to as &quot;Ulestanestorp&quot;, in the Kesteven Hundred of Winnibriggs and Threo. It comprised 29 households, 6 villagers, 3 smallholders and 8 freemen, with 4 ploughlands and 3 mills. In 1066 Leofric of Bottesford was Lord of the Manor, this transferred in 1086 to Robert of Tosny, who also became Tenant-in-chief.

A possible deserted medieval village lies at the southern edge of the present village just to the east off Woolsthorpe Lane, on the same site of a previous St James church destroyed in 1643 by Parliamentary forces. Of the destruction &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Directory&quot; wrote in 1885: &quot;the original church of St. James, of which some fragments of the tower remain, was burned down by soldiers of the Parliamentary Army who bivouacked there during the siege of Belvoir Castle&quot;.

Further evidence of medieval and earlier occupation are finds of a stone macehead at the centre of the village, Roman coins and a Middle Bronze Age cinerary urn to the south-west, and medieval ridge and furrow earthworks, and a trackway seen through cropmarks, to the north. Approximately north from Woolsthorpe is the deserted medieval village of Stenwith, defined by moat, ditch, enclosure, hollow way and croft (homestead with land) earthworks. Stenwith is recorded in the &quot;Domesday&quot; account as &quot;Stanwald&quot; or &quot;Stanwalt&quot;. in the Lincolnshire Hundred of Winnibriggs and Threo. It was part of the manor of Barrowby and comprised 21 households, 2 smallholders and 19 freemen, with 4 ploughlands, of meadow and one mill. In 1066 Godwin of Barrowby was Lord of the Manor, this transferred in 1086 to Robert Malet, who also became Tenant-in-chief.

=== 19th century ===

In 1885 &quot;Kelly&#x27;s&quot; describes Woolsthorpe as situated on the River Devon, close to the borders of Leicestershire. It was in the wapentake of Winnibriggs and Threo, the petty sessional division of Spittlegate, the union and county court district of South Grantham, and in the Archdeaconry and Diocese of Lincoln. The nearest railway station was noted as away at Sedgebrook, on the Great Northern Railway line. Parts of the &quot;plantations and pleasure grounds of Belvoir Castle... are in this parish&quot;; Belvoir castle was supplied with water from the parish&#x27;s Holywell spring. The parish area of had a rateable value of £2,983. Crops grown were chiefly wheat, barley and oats. Parish population in 1881 was 598.

In 1879 the Stanton Iron Company began quarrying for marl ironstone at Woolsthorpe, on land leased from the Duke of Rutland. The ore was taken by horse and cart to the Grantham Canal. The Great Northern Railway built a branch to Woolsthorpe in 1883. At first ironstone was transported by trains run by the Stanton company via this branch to the Grantham to Nottingham mainline. Later this line was operated by the Great Northern. A gauge tramway carried the ore from the quarries to the Great Northern branch. The northern end of the tramway was a cable-worked incline. Horses were used to pull the wagons on the upper section of the tramway until the first steam locomotive arrived in November 1883. The first quarry was at Brewer&#x27;s Grave to the north of the Denton Road and west of Longmoor Lane, and the tramway was known as the Brewer&#x27;s Grave Tramway. The quarries were extended to the east, north and south of this and then into the parish of Harston in Leicestershire to the south. The quarries at Woolsthorpe were worked out by 1923 but quarrying carried on at Harston and later Knipton and Denton for many years. The Woolsthorpe tramway was abandoned around 1918 by which time the Woolsthorpe branch of the Great Northern branch had been extended to a point in Denton Parish just north of the Denton to Harston Road to serve the quarries. Another tramway linked the southernmost Woolsthope quarries to the new branch terminus. The mainline branch was still used to carry ironstone until the closure of the Denton quarries in 1974.

One steam locomotive used on the tramway survived. Nancy was built in 1908 for the Stanton Ironworks Company. She is now preserved in working order at the Cavan and Leitrim Railway in Ireland.

&quot;Kelly&#x27;s&quot; in 1885 also recorded the Duke of Rutland KG as lord of the manor and chief landowner. Within the village were a boot-and-shoe maker, two shopkeepers-cum-carriers, a shoemakers with post office, a butcher-cum-grocer, two carpenters, two tailors, two shopkeepers, a blacksmith, a baker-cum-beer retailer, two farmers, a butcher-cum-farmer, and a homoeopathist. There were two public houses, the Rutland Arms and the Chequers, and a ladies boarding and day school. Living in the village was a gamekeeper and a farm bailiff, both in the employ of the Duke of Rutland, and a surgeon medical officer who was public vaccinator for the Denton district and Grantham Union. Five carriers from the village delivered to Grantham&#x27;s Blue Man, Blue Ram, and Blue Bull public houses.

=== 20th century ===
The village was designated a conservation area by South Kesteven Council in 1997.

==Landmarks==
Woolsthorpe Grade II listed Anglican church is dedicated to St James. It was built of ironstone in 1845–47 by G. G. Place, replacing an earlier 1793 church on the same site. &quot;Kelly&#x27;s&quot; wrote of the church and its history:The church of St. James is a building of stone, in the Decorated style, erected in 1845–6 from designs by Mr. G. G. Place, of Nottingham, and consisting of chancel, nave, aisles and a tower, as yet unfinished: it has a very elaborately carved Perpendicular font, and the east window and some others are stained... [following the destruction of the earlier church in 1643] services were afterwards held in the Chapel of St. Mary, a small building in the middle of the village, which was taken down in 1793, and a church erected on the same site: the present edifice will seat 400 persons. The register of baptisms date from 1663; marriages, 1662; burials, 1661. The living is a rectory, tithe rent-charge £80, net yearly value £230, including 38 acres of glebe with residence, in the gift of the Duke of Rutland K.G. and held since 1879 by the Rev. Edward Alfred Gillett M.A. of Exeter College, Oxford.
On Village Street is a Grade II listed former County Primary School and schoolmaster&#x27;s house. It was built in the style of St James&#x27; Church. In 1885 &quot;Kelly&#x27;s&quot; described the school as an &quot;elementary School (mixed), built in 1871, at a cost of £1,200, for 120 children, with an average attendance of 112; &amp; supported by voluntary subscriptions, school pence &amp; government grant.&quot;

Further listed buildings include the red-brick mid-18th-century Woolsthorpe House on Belvoir Lane, and the red-brick Rectory on Rectory Lane, dating from the late 18th century. &quot;Pevsner&quot; mentions the wharf on the Grantham Canal which was used to unload stone, and &quot;charming lock cottages&quot;.

Of the ironstone workings little can be seen today except for the remains of the cable worked incline and the remains of the branch railway. In places it can be seen that the level of the fields and lanes has been lowered.

<text>The Buchanan Dam () is a multiple arch dam located on the Colorado River of Texas. The dam forms Lake Buchanan and was the first dam to be completed in the chain of Texas Highland Lakes. The dam is used for generating hydroelectric power and for flood control and is located about west of Burnet, Texas.

==History==
Construction of the then-named George W. Hamilton Dam was started in 1931 by a company controlled by Samuel Insull, but soon ended with the dam less than half completed when his highly leveraged public utility holding company collapsed during the Great Depression. In 1934, the Texas legislature authorized the formation of the Lower Colorado River Authority to complete the Hamilton dam. Following completion in 1937, the dam was renamed for U.S. Representative James P. Buchanan, who helped obtain federal funding for the project from the Public Works Administration.

Construction of the dam required the relocation of the town of Bluffton, Texas. Relocation began in 1931 and was complete by 1939. A 2011 drought re-exposed the old Bluffton townsite.

Following a flood along the river in 1938, in which the dam was required to pass through all of the flow of water, there was criticism of the dam project as failing to meet its promise of preventing downstream floods. However, at the time it was pointed out that the Buchanan Dam was just the first in a series of four flood control dams, and that prevention of flooding would not be possible until they were finished.

<doc id="317827" wikidata="Q2102402" url="?curid=317827" title="Morton's fork">
<text>A Morton&#x27;s fork is a type of false dilemma in which contradictory observations lead to the same conclusion. Its name dates back to the rationalising of a benevolence by the 15th century English prelate John Morton.

The earliest known use of the term dates from the mid-19th century and the only known earlier mention is a claim by Francis Bacon of an extant tradition.

==Dilemma==

Under Henry VII, John Morton was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1486 and Lord Chancellor in 1487. He rationalised requiring the payment of a benevolence (tax) to King Henry by reasoning that someone living modestly must be saving money and therefore could afford the benevolence, whereas someone living extravagantly was obviously rich and therefore could also afford the benevolence. &quot;Morton&#x27;s Fork&quot; may have been invented by another of Henry&#x27;s supporters, Richard Foxe.

==Other uses==
&quot;Morton&#x27;s fork coup&quot; is a manoeuvre in the game of bridge that uses the principle of Morton&#x27;s fork.

<doc id="317828" wikidata="Q2306978" url="?curid=317828" title="O Lucky Man!">
<text>O Lucky Man! is a 1973 British comedy-drama fantasy film directed by Lindsay Anderson and starring Malcolm McDowell as Mick Travis, whom McDowell had first played as a disaffected public schoolboy in his first film performance in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;if...&quot; (1968). &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; is the second film in the Mick Travis trilogy, all starring McDowell as an everyman character, concluding with &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982).

==Plot==
The film is prefaced by a short story that begins &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, a silent, black-and-white film that depicts an unnamed country filled with peasant laborers. They pick coffee beans while armed foremen push rudely between them. One worker (McDowell with black hair and a mustache) pockets a few beans for himself (&quot;Coffee for the Breakfast Table&quot;), but he is discovered by a foreman. He is next seen before a fat magistrate who slobbers as he removes his cigar only to say &quot;Guilty.&quot; The foreman draws his machete and lays it across the unfortunate laborer&#x27;s wrists, bound to a wooden block, revealing that he is to lose his hands for the theft of a few beans. The machete rises and falls, and the laborer draws back in a silent scream. The scene blacks out and the title &quot;NOW&quot; appears onscreen and quickly expands to fill it.

During his life journey, Michael Arnold &quot;Mick&quot; Travis slowly learns the lesson (reinforced by numerous songs in the soundtrack by Alan Price), that he must abandon his principles in order to succeed in life. Nevertheless, unlike the other characters he meets, he retains a detached idealism that allows him to distance himself from the evils of the world. Initially, Travis is motivated only by money and material wealth. He progresses from a coffee salesman (working for Imperial Coffee in the North East of England and Scotland) to a victim of torture in a government installation and a medical research subject, under the supervision of Dr. Millar.

In parallel with Travis&#x27;s experiences, the narration shows 1960s Britain slowly retreating from its imperial past but retaining some influence by means of corrupt dealings with the foreign dictators of countries that had recently fought for their independence. After finding out his girlfriend Patricia is the daughter of Sir James Burgess, an evil industrialist, Travis is appointed Burgess&#x27; personal assistant. Burgess is allied with Dr. Munda, the dictator of Zingara (a fictional African country), who has created a brutal police state and playground for wealthy people from the developed world. Burgess sells the regime a chemical called &quot;PL45 &#x27;Honey&#x27;&quot;, which the dictator sprays on rebel areas; its effects resemble those of napalm. When public outcry goes international, Burgess conspires to convict Travis of fraud. Travis is imprisoned for five years.

Five years later Travis has finished his sentence, become a model prisoner, and converted to humanism. He is quickly faced with a bewildering series of assaults upon his new-found idealism (&quot;Look Over Your Shoulder&quot;). While stopping at a slum in London&#x27;s outskirts he finds out that Patricia and her wealthy husband — whom Patricia married for financial stability while cheating on him with Travis — have lost all of their money and are living in extreme poverty. Travis&#x27; misadventures culminate in him being attacked by down-and-outs he had been trying to help.

Becoming despondent and wandering the streets, the now-destitute Travis inadvertently becomes involved in a casting call for a film production (with Lindsay Anderson himself playing the director of the film). He is given various props to handle, including a stack of schoolbooks and a machine gun (both reminiscent of Mick Travis&#x27; first chapter in the trilogy, &quot;if...&quot;). The director believes he has found the protagonist for his new film in Travis, but when asked to smile for his screen test Travis, failing to understand what is being asked of him, is befuddled and repeatedly asks why he should smile since he feels he has no reason to do so. Suddenly, the director slaps Travis with his script book, and Travis, having an epiphany, slowly begins to smile. After a cut to black (a device used throughout the film) it is implied that Travis has become a successful actor and wealthy celebrity. He is then shown dancing at a raucous party (&quot;O Lucky Man!&quot;), which includes all of the film&#x27;s cast celebrating.

==Production==
The film originally began as a script written by McDowell about his experiences as a coffee salesman in his late teens and early 20s. Anderson was unhappy with this treatment, and David Sherwin worked on the script. Sherwin though was undergoing personal problems at the time, which necessitated Anderson writing a few scenes himself, a skill he did not feel he had. Anderson found working with Czech cinematographer Miroslav Ondříček much less rewarding than he had on &quot;if...&quot;. He also doubted his own skills as a director during the film&#x27;s making, and felt that the film had insufficient preparation. The role of Patricia was recast during production. Originally, Fiona Lewis, best known for appearing in several horror films around this time, played the role.

&quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982) completes the trilogy of films featuring Mick Travis, which also sees the return of Dr. Millar.

==Soundtrack==

Alan Price said Lindsay Anderson wanted to make a documentary about Price and his band touring England, but the cost of licensing songs they performed was too high. As Sherwin and McDowell developed the script, Anderson decided Price should write the score and sent him the script, indicating where he would like songs to appear. Price wrote nearly all the songs before filming started. Anderson conceived of Price&#x27;s role as a kind of Greek Chorus, both commenting on and finally appearing as part of the action.

The soundtrack was released as a vinyl album, by Warner Bros. Records, in 1973. In the U.S., it entered the Top LPs &amp; Tape chart on 11 August 1973, and spent 14 weeks on the chart, peaking at no. 117.

The score won the 1974 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.

===Track listing===

# &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot;
# &quot;Poor People&quot;
# &quot;Sell Sell&quot;
# &quot;Pastoral&quot;
# &quot;Arrival&quot;
# &quot;Look Over Your Shoulder&quot;
# &quot;Justice&quot;
# &quot;My Home Town&quot;
# &quot;Changes&quot;
# &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot;
The song &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; has lyrics that mirror the fable from the Pasolini&#x27;s film Uccellacci e uccellini – The Hawk and the Sparrows. “Takers and fakers and talkers won’t tell you. Teachers and preachers will just buy and sell you. When no one can tempt you with heaven or hell- You’ll be a lucky man!” says the bird.

The song &quot;Changes&quot; (based on the tune to &quot;What a Friend We Have in Jesus&quot;) was later a chart hit for Price in April 1988 when it was used in a television advertisement of the same name for Volkswagen Golf cars in 1987, starring model Paula Hamilton. The song &quot;Sell Sell&quot; was recorded by Widespread Panic for their twelfth studio album &quot;Street Dogs&quot; and has been performed by the band on several occasions beginning on 19 February 2012 in Aspen, Colorado for the final night of their Wood Tour.

===Charts===
==Release==
The film was entered into the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.

===Versions===
A number of different edits exist, with some American prints removing around twenty minutes including the working class parody suicide, just before the conclusion of the film. Even both British VHS releases delete at least one scene present in the BBC broadcast of the film (Travis testing his status in the home of his industrialist patron) in the early eighties. The original editor&#x27;s cut was 183 minutes, but the distributor demanded a shorter version. The cinema release was 168 minutes, achieved by accidentally missing &quot;roll 16&quot; during an editing session.

===Home media===
A 2-disc special edition Region 1 DVD, including commentary by Malcolm McDowell, David Sherwin and Alan Price, and the feature-length documentary &quot;O Lucky Malcolm!&quot;, was released by the Criterion Collection on 30 October 2007.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes 80% of reviews from 20 critics reviews were positive with an average rating of 7.7 out of 10.

Some critics consider this film one of the best British films ever.

in a negative review for &quot;Creem&quot; in 1973, Robert Christgau said, &quot;How does an acerbic, good-humored music journeyman like Price (find: &quot;This Price is Right&quot;, on Parrot) fall in with a pompous, overfed con man like Lindsay Anderson? By playing the Acerbic, Good-Humoured Music Journeyman Symbol in a pompous, overfed movie. Two or three deft political songs do not redeem an LP that runs under 25 minutes despite filler. It figures—the movie is an hour (or three hours) too long.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; rated it 2 out of 4 and wrote: &quot;Staying with it through its almost three-hour running time becomes increasingly nerve-racking, like watching superimposed images that never synchronize. The result does not match the ambition of the intention. The wit is too small, too perfunctory, for the grand plan of the film and the quality of the production itself.&quot;

Reviewing the film for BFI in May 2024, Stephen Dalton said:

An anarchic joyride through the tragicomic horrorscape of early 1970s Britain, Lindsay Anderson’s maximalist musical satire &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; has lost little of its disturbing, lurid, carnivalesque power in the half century since it was released. Part bawdy farce, part picaresque road movie, part sprawling state-of-the-nation sermon, this boldly experimental three-hour pageant stars Malcolm McDowell alongside a stellar ensemble cast of British screen stalwarts. ... A heady cocktail of Brecht and Buñuel, Lewis Carroll and Monty Python, Jean-Luc Godard and Ken Russell, &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; still contains plenty to delight, shock and disgust 21st century audiences. Admittedly some elements have dated exceptionally badly, especially the Carry On-style depiction of women as pliant nymphomaniacs, and the jarring spectacle of beloved Dad’s Army star Arthur Lowe in full blackface (a decision that would have been unremarkable in 1973, when &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; was still a high-rating BBC fixture). Despite this, the film’s rich combination of cynicism and romanticism, jaunty music and bitingly absurd humour, can still feel fresh and spiky today, with its proto-punk contempt for bourgeois good taste.

<doc id="317833" wikidata="Q4861900" url="?curid=317833" title="Barnsley Canal">
<text>The Barnsley Canal is a canal that ran from Barnby Basin, through Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England, to a junction with the Aire and Calder Navigation near Wakefield, West Yorkshire. It was built in the 1790s, to provide a transport link from coal reserves at Barnsley to a wider market. Both the Aire and Calder Navigation and the River Don Navigation took a keen interest in the project, the former buying many of the initial shares, and the latter constructing the Dearne and Dove Canal to link the canal to their waterway. Water supply issues meant that the Aire and Calder proposed pumping all of the water for the canal from the River Calder, using steam pumps, but a reservoir was built at Cold Hiendley instead, increasing the construction costs, but reducing the running costs. The canal as built was long and included 15 locks.

Traffic came initially from the colliery at Barnby Furnace, but this failed in 1806, and the company found itself with no money and little traffic. Gradually, tramways to other mines were built, and traffic increased, enough to pay dividends to the shareholders from 1810 onwards. Many bridges were raised between 1828 and 1830, to accommodate larger barges. Railways arrived in the area in the 1840s, and traffic volumes decreased rapidly, but the canal was taken over by the Aire and Calder Navigation in 1856, and despite competition from the railways, and structural damage from subsidence, remained profitable until 1942. The locks below Cold Hiendley were lengthened between 1879 and 1881, and the final section including the five Barugh locks was closed in 1893.

A major breach occurred in 1911, resulting in the canal being closed for nearly a year, and further breaches occurred in 1945 and 1946. The Aire and Calder applied to abandon the canal in 1947, and despite protestations from the fledgling Inland Waterways Association, the right to do so was granted in 1953. The aqueduct over the River Dearne was demolished immediately. The Barnsley Canal Group was formed in 1984, to campaign for restoration, eventually becoming the Barnsley, Dearne and Dove Canal Trust in June 2000. They are now part of the Barnsley Canal Consortium, which has commissioned a study which showed that restoration is feasible. A restored route would involve three diversions from the historic route, at Walton locks, near Cold Hiendley reservoir, and where the canal crosses the River Dearne.

==History==
The early 1790s were a time when there was an increasing demand for coal, but a shortage in many places because much of the coal being produced was being consumed by industries close to the mines. There were coal reserves near Barnsley, but no transport links to distribute it to the region. In July 1792, the Aire and Calder Canal Company asked William Martin, who was the manager of the canal, to prepare plans for a link from near Wakefield to the Barnsley mines. Hearing of the plans, the River Don Navigation Company proposed an alternative, which involved the canalisation of the River Dearne, to reach the same destination. The Aire and Calder scheme foresaw a healthy trade in coal and manufactured goods from Barnsley to the Aire and Calder, and agricultural lime from Knottingley in the reverse direction.

Martin and the Aire and Calder&#x27;s resident engineers surveyed the route, and at a public meeting held on 20 September 1792, the canal engineer William Jessop suggested that the line from just below Wakefield to Barnsley and Silkstone could be built for approximately £50,000. The Aire and Calder decided to subscribe £20,000 for shares, to ensure that they held a majority shareholding. A further meeting in mid-October reported that the cost was now £60,000, and that 86 people had subscribed to it. The River Don company attended the meeting, as they were keen to use the Barnsley to Silkstone route for their Dearne and Dove Canal, but an agreement was reached, whereby the Barnsley Canal Company would build the Barnby to Barnsley section, but no water would be taken from the River Dearne, which was needed to supply the Dearne and Dove Canal. A branch from Barugh to Haigh Bridge, including an extra seven locks, was added to the scheme.
The Aire and Calder proposed to pump all the water for the canal from the River Calder, using steam-driven pumps at Agbrigg, Walton and Barugh. The Haigh branch would have required a fourth engine, but the Haigh furnace closed and the branch was never built. The pumps at Walton and Agbrigg were replaced by a reservoir at Cold Hiendley, which increased the construction costs by £3,000, but reduced running costs by £350 per year. An act of Parliament, the (33 Geo. 3. c. 110), was obtained on 3 June 1793, which created the company and authorised them to raise £72,000 by the issuing of shares, with an additional £25,000 by shares or by mortgage if it was required. The Dearne and Dove canal was authorised on the same day.

===Construction===
Construction work started on 27 September 1793, at Heath Common, near the junction with the Aire and Calder Canal. Samual Hartley was the engineer, and John Pinkerton was contracted to build the canal. Construction was difficult, with Pinkerton unexpectedly encountering rock in the cutting at Cold Hiendley, and inflation pushed up the costs. There were disputes between Hartley and Pinkerton, which lasted until long after the canal was opened, and were finally settled in 1812, after a lawsuit. The northern section to Barnsley opened on 8 June 1799, while the Barnsley to Barnby section was not started until late 1798, and did not open until early 1802. The Dearne and Dove Canal was completed in late 1804.

The cost of construction was £95,000. The original scheme envisaged a number of tramways to connect to the coal mines, but none of these were built initially. Major engineering features included a five-arched aqueduct where the canal crossed the River Dearne, a long cutting at Cold Hiendley, five locks at Barugh, another twelve at Walton, two at Agbrigg and the final one near Heath. This lock was situated at the end of a cut, which frequently filled with rubbish, and so it was replaced in 1816 by a new lock much closer to the Aire and Calder. The Wintersett reservoir covered an area of when first built, which increased to when its banks were raised by in 1807. In 1803, a pumping station was built at Ryhill, using a Cornish beam engine obtained from Harveys of Hayle, which pumped surplus water from the canal up into the reservoir. Land for a second reservoir at Cold Hiendley was obtained in 1840, and it was built in 1854. It was located between Wintersett Reservoir and the canal, but was at a lower level, and the pumping station was modified so that water could also be pumped from the new reservoir into the canal. The Cold Hiendley reservoir was enlarged to cover in 1874. The beam engine, which was probably second-hand in 1803, gave good service and lasted until the closure of the canal in 1946.

===Traffic===

The canal was principally designed to carry coal from collieries in the Barnby region. The Low Moor Company had a colliery at Barnby Furnace, and constructed the long Low Moor Waggonway between there and Barnby basin, which was carrying coal by 1802. By 1804, around 10,000 tons was leaving the colliery, although the Dearne and Dove Canal had opened in late 1803, and only about half of the trade travelled the full length of the canal to the Aire and Calder. Coal from the Silkstone collieries was sporadic, as the tramway which had been authorised by the act of Parliament was not built due to financial constraints. The Barnby Furnace mine failed in May 1807, and the company found itself with no money and little traffic. It obtained a new act of Parliament, the (48 Geo. 3. c. xiii), on 28 March 1808, authorising it to raise another £43,000 in share capital, and £10,000 by mortgage. They were also able to raise the tolls.

The Silkstone Waggonway was completed in 1810. Barnby basin was enlarged to cope with the expected trade, which grew steadily. Coal accounted for just 23 per cent of the 22,270 tons carried in 1800, but had risen to 109,945 tons out of a total of 181,063 tons by 1821. The other main cargoes were corn and limestone. Receipts also rose, from £2,028 in 1803 to 7,649 in 1821, the latter figure being supplemented by a further £2,094 raised from tramway tolls. Profits were sufficient to pay dividends from 1810. In order to keep the boats moving, the Barnsley Canal Company attempted to take water from the River Dearne on several occasions, and were ordered to remove the works which diverted the water by the River Don Navigation Company, who had sponsored the Dearne and Dove Canal. A compromise was reached in 1812, which allowed some of the Dearne water to be used by the Barnsley canal. Between 1828 and 1830, a number of bridges were raised, to allow larger vessels, called &quot;Billy-boys&quot;, to use the canal.

===Competition===
Competition in the form of railways started to affect the canal from the 1840s. The canal company initially welcomed some of the schemes, but the Don Navigation Company proposed to lease the canal for a year in 1845 and then to buy it, in order to prevent the railways gaining access to the Silkstone coal resources, and to protect the water supplies. They quickly offered to pass the canal on to the Aire and Calder Company, and to buy the Dearne and Dove Canal, but although they took over the Dearne and Dove Canal from 1 January 1846, they dropped their ideas for the Barnsley Canal. The Barnsley Canal Company then tried to arrange a lease with the Aire and Calder, but negotiations foundered. A series of negotiations took place with the Yorkshire Railway Company, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and the Aire and Calder Navigation between 1846 and 1853. It was not until 1854 that the company finally agreed to a lease from the Aire and Calder, by which time traffic was falling rapidly. The takeover was ratified by an act of Parliament in 1856, although the Barnsley Canal Company was not wound up, as it continued to collect the rent from the lease.
By reducing tolls, the Aire and Calder managed to increase traffic from 179,295 tons in 1855 to 291,313 tons in 1863, but traffic gradually reduced after that, as railway links to the coalfields were built. The canal structures were increasingly affected by subsidence from the mining, and an inspection of the aqueduct in 1866 revealed &quot;fissures in the rock and cracks in the arches&quot;. In 1870, Barnsley Corporation ordered the canal company to stop extracting water from the River Dearne, as they needed the supply. Faced with a dilemma, the Barnsley and the Aire and Calder companies negotiated, and the result was the (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. cxcv), which authorised the takeover of the canal by the Aire and Calder, the replacing of ten of the twelve Walton locks by an inclined plane, and protection of the water supply at Barugh.

The locks below Cold Hiendley were lengthened from to between 1879 and 1881, but by this time there was little traffic on the upper section. The final section to Barnby, including the five locks at Barugh were abandoned under the terms of the Aire and Calder Navigation Act 1893 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. cxlviii). Powers to build the inclined plane were renewed in 1889, but no construction took place. Despite railway competition, the canal still carried in excess of 200,000 tons per year between 1885 and 1909.

===Decline===

A major breach of the canal occurred on 20 November 1911, when subsidence caused part of the aqueduct and the adjacent embankment to fail. Repairs were not completed until 10 July 1912, when the canal was reopened. The canal had to close for four months at the end of 1922 due to drought conditions. In 1934, the county council installed an electric lift bridge at Royston. Traffic continued to fall, and maintenance costs increased as the effects of subsidence damaged the infrastructure, but the canal remained profitable until 1942. The following year, the Royston bridge was operated 856 times to allow boats to pass. Mottram Wood colliery was flooded on 13 June 1945, when another leak occurred near the aqueduct, and in 1946, of water escaped from the canal on 22 November, flooding a housing estate and the surrounding countryside. The Aire and Calder applied to abandon the canal in May 1947, and although the fledgeling Inland Waterways Association campaigned for its retention, the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive (DIWE) expressed &quot;grave doubts as to whether it would be in the national interest to reinstate the waterway.&quot; The DIWE then offered compensation to carriers who were affected by the closure, and the abandonment order was finally granted in 1953. The aqueduct was demolished immediately, as it was deemed to be unsafe.

==Restoration==
The line of the canal below Barugh has remained largely intact, and in April 1984, the Barnsley Canal Group was formed, with the aim of campaigning for the restoration of the canal. Their first task was to undertake a detailed survey of the canal, to confirm that restoration was at least realistic. Having become a Limited Company and obtaining charitable status in April 1991, the group reformed as the Barnsley, Dearne and Dove Canal Trust in June 2000. In May 2001, the Barnsley Canal Consortium, consisting of a working group which includes local authorities, the Inland Waterways Association and the Canal Trust, was formed. The Consortium employed professional engineers to carry out a feasibility study on the reopening of both the Barnsley Canal and the Dearne and Dove Canal in August 2004, and the report, which was published in November 2006 confirmed that restoration was possible.

The restored canal would follow the original line from the Aire and Calder Navigation to Barnsley, where a new marina would be built near to the location of Barugh locks. Three diversions would be required, one at the foot of the Walton locks, one near Cold Hiendley reservoir, and one where the canal crosses the River Dearne, where the original aqueduct has been demolished.

In 2019, a public enquiry about Barnsley Metropolitan District Council&#x27;s local plan was held, at which the council recommended that a firm line for the restored canal should not be included, and this decision was upheld by the inspector. In the light of this, the lack of new members, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Trust took the decision to cease operation in April 2020, although the AGM at which the decision would be ratified was postponed due to the pandemic. They are expected to transfer their assets to the Chesterfield Canal Trust, who will also ensure that the Trust website is maintained as a source of information for some years.

In 2020, a local resident from Redbrook called James Crampton set up a Facebook group called Barnsley Old Canal during the Coronavirus lockdown, where people could share their stories of the canal. Within a few months, over 450 people had registered an interest in maintaining the canal&#x27;s heritage. Before long, people started to think about restoration, and the group have decided that their first objective should be improvements to the towpath between Barugh Green and Smithies.

<text>Lake Buchanan () was formed by the construction of Buchanan Dam by the Lower Colorado River Authority to provide a water supply for the region and to provide hydroelectric power. Buchanan Dam, a structure over 2 mi (3.2 km) in length, was completed in 1939. Lake Buchanan was the first of the Texas Highland Lakes to be formed, and with of surface water, it is also the largest. The surface of the lake includes area in both Burnet and Llano Counties. The lake is west of the city of Burnet, Texas.

The other reservoirs on the Colorado River are Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, Lake Austin, and Lady Bird Lake.

The lake is named for Representative James P. Buchanan (1867–1937), who is credited with securing the funding to build the lake and dam.

==History==
Lake Buchanan was artificially created upon the completion of the adjacent Buchanan Dam in 1938. Work on the dam itself began in April 1931, but was suspended a year later. Work resumed in 1935, with the dam completed three years later. However, deliberate impounding of the reservoir began in May 1937. Initially, the dam and resulting reservoir project was known as Hamilton Dam and Reservoir, but its name was changed to honor Texas Congressman James P. Buchanan upon the completion of the project; Buchanan had been responsible for securing federal funding for the project. The flooding of the lake forced the community of Bluffton to relocate westward. The abandoned community was soon inundated; however, a drought in 2011 caused Lake Buchanan&#x27;s water level to drop significantly, exposing the remains of the town.

==Fish and wildlife populations==
Lake Buchanan has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Lake Buchanan include largemouth bass, catfish, white bass, and striped bass. Lake Buchanan is a level-controlled reservoir, and will not be allowed to flood during periods of heavy rain. The lake level can, however, drop significantly during periods of drought.

==Recreational uses==
Much of the property bordering Lake Buchanan is privately owned. Many lakeside cottages and homes are rented out on a regular basis. The Lower Colorado River Authority maintains three parks on the lake: Cedar Point Recreation Area, Black Rock Park, and Canyon of the Eagles. County parks and private marinas offer boating access to the lake. Fall Creek Winery, the oldest winery in the Texas Hill Country, is located near the confluence of Fall Creek and Lake Buchanan.

<doc id="317840" wikidata="Q237918" url="?curid=317840" title="Ann Richards">
<text>Dorothy Ann Richards (née Willis; September 1, 1933 – September 13, 2006) was an American politician who served as the 45th governor of Texas from 1991 to 1995. A Democrat, she first came to national attention as the Texas State Treasurer, when she gave the keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Richards was the second female governor of Texas (the first being Miriam A. Ferguson), and was frequently noted in the media for her outspoken feminism and her one-liners.

Born in McLennan County, Texas, Richards became a schoolteacher after graduating from Baylor University. She won election to the Travis County Commissioners&#x27; Court in 1976, and took office as Texas State Treasurer in 1983. She delivered a nominating speech for Walter Mondale at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and the keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention.

Richards won the 1990 Texas gubernatorial election, defeating Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox in a Democratic primary run-off election and businessman Clayton Williams in the general election. She was defeated in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election by George W. Bush. She remained active in public life until her death in 2006. To date, Richards is the most recent Democrat and woman to serve as Governor of Texas.

==Early life==
Richards was born in Lakeview (now part of Lacy Lakeview), in McLennan County, Texas, the only child of Robert Cecil Willis and Mildred Iona &quot;Ona&quot; Warren. Robert Cecil Willis was a pharmaceutical salesman who served in World War II and Mildred Iona Warren was a homemaker. Both of Richards&#x27; parents were Texas natives. Richards grew up in Waco, and the family briefly lived in San Diego, before moving back to Texas at the start of Richards&#x27;s high school years. At this time, she dropped her first name and went by her middle name. She participated in Girls State, a mock-government assembly. She also was the Texas delegate in Washington, D.C. at the Girls Nation event, where she found her passion for politics. She graduated from Waco High School in 1950. She attended Baylor University on a debate team scholarship, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree. After marrying her high school sweetheart David &quot;Dave&quot; Richards, she moved to Austin, where she earned a teaching certificate from the University of Texas. David and Ann Richards had four children: Cecile, Daniel, Clarke, and Ellen. Her first cousin once removed was the art historian Gary Tinterow. Cecile was born on July 15, 1957. She is the former president of Planned Parenthood (2006–2018). Cecile died of glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer that is incurable and has a survival rate of 12 to 18 months, on January 20, 2025.

Richards taught social studies and history at Fulmore Junior High School (re-named Lively Middle School) in Austin from 1955 to 1956. She campaigned for Texas liberals and progressives, such as Henry B. Gonzalez, Ralph Yarborough, and future U.S. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes.

==Political career==

===State Treasurer===
After incumbent Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding (no relation to the U.S. president) became mired in legal troubles in 1982, Richards won the Democratic nomination for that post. Winning election against a Republican opponent in November that year, Richards became the first woman elected to statewide office in more than fifty years. In 1986, she was re-elected treasurer without opposition. Richards was a popular and proactive treasurer who worked to maximize the return of Texas state investments. Richards said that when she took office, the Treasury Department was run something like a 1930s country bank, with deposits that didn&#x27;t earn interest. At the 1984 Democratic National Convention, Richards delivered one of the nominating speeches for nominee Walter Mondale, and she campaigned actively for the Mondale/Ferraro ticket in Texas, even though President Ronald Reagan enjoyed great popularity in her state.

===1988 Democratic National Convention===
Richards&#x27; keynote address to the 1988 Democratic National Convention put her in the national spotlight. The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then–Vice President George H. W. Bush. Her address was notable for several remarks: &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like&quot;, &quot;Poor George, he can&#x27;t help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth&quot;, &quot;Two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels&quot;, and &quot;When we pay billions for planes that won&#x27;t fly, billions for tanks that won&#x27;t fire, and billions for systems that won&#x27;t work, that old dog won&#x27;t hunt. And you don&#x27;t have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn&#x27;t make America strong, that it&#x27;s a bum deal&quot;. Richards&#x27; convention address has been cited by rhetorical experts as a historically significant speech. In the presidential debate that year between Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, Bush referenced Richard&#x27;s uncivil comments about him during her speech on his way to winning the White House. 
The speech set the tone for Richards&#x27; political future. In 1989, with co-author Peter Knobler, she wrote her autobiography, &quot;Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places&quot;.

===Governor (1991–1995)===

In 1990, Texas&#x27; Republican governor, Bill Clements, decided not to run for re-election to a third nonconsecutive term. Richards painted herself as a sensible progressive and won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination against Attorney General (and former U.S. representative) Jim Mattox of Dallas and former Governor Mark White of Houston. Mattox ran a particularly abrasive campaign against Richards, accusing her of having had drug problems beyond alcoholism. The Republicans nominated colorful and eccentric multi-millionaire rancher Clayton Williams, of Fort Stockton and Midland. Republican political activist Susan Weddington of San Antonio, a Williams supporter, placed a black wreath that read &quot;Death to the Family&quot; at the door of Richards&#x27;s campaign headquarters in Austin. After a series of gaffes by Williams (most notably a joke about rape), Richards narrowly won on November 6, 1990, with 49% of the vote to Williams&#x27; 47%. Libertarian Party nominee Jeff Daiell drew 3.3 percent in an effort that included television spots and considerable personal campaigning. Richards was inaugurated governor the following January.
Richards became the second woman to hold Texas&#x27;s top office, since Miriam &quot;Ma&quot; Ferguson. Her chief of staff was Mary Beth Rogers.

In 1994, Richards ran for re-election against Republican George W. Bush. Despite outspending his campaign by 23%, she was defeated, with 45.88% of the vote to Bush&#x27;s 53.48% while Libertarian Keary Ehlers received 0.64%. The Richards campaign had hoped for a misstep from the relatively inexperienced Republican nominee, but none appeared, while Richards created many of her own, including calling Bush &quot;some jerk&quot;, &quot;shrub&quot; and &quot;that young Bush boy&quot;.

====Tenure as Governor====
As governor, Richards reformed the Texas prison system, establishing a substance abuse program for inmates, reducing the number of violent offenders released, and increasing prison space to deal with a growing prison population (from less than 60,000 in 1992 to more than 80,000 in 1994). She backed proposals to reduce the sale of semi-automatic firearms and &quot;cop-killer&quot; bullets in the state.
The Texas Lottery was also instituted during her governorship—advocated as a means of supplementing school finances; Richards purchased the first lottery ticket on May 29, 1992, in Oak Hill, near Austin.

School finance remained one of the key issues of Richards&#x27; governorship and of those succeeding hers; the famous Robin Hood plan was launched in the 1992–1993 biennium and attempted to make school funding more equitable across school districts. Richards also sought to decentralize control over education policy to districts and individual campuses; she instituted &quot;site-based management&quot; to this end.

One of her first goals was to focus on education. To do so, she held a &quot;school assembly&quot; on January 19, 1991, where she met with students as well as teachers from all over Texas to hear directly from the source what needed to change in the school systems. She found this to be important because these are the people who were directly affected by the education system at the time. She found education to be extremely important and this was clear during her time in office.

In 1993, Richards signed into law the re-codified Texas Penal Code which included anti-homosexual Section 21.06, the state&#x27;s &quot;Homosexual Conduct&quot; law which states: &quot;(a) A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.
(b) An offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor.&quot;. In 1990, Richards had campaigned in Houston to repeal the law. But, as governor, her signature criminalized same-sex sexual relations in Texas.

==Post-governorship==
Richards was defeated in the 1994 Republican landslide that also unseated New York Governor Mario Cuomo and brought a Republican majority to the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. Richards and Cuomo appeared in a series of humorous television commercials for the snack food Doritos shortly afterward, in which they discussed the &quot;sweeping changes&quot; occurring. The changes they are discussing turn out to be the new Doritos packaging.

Beginning in 2001, Richards was a senior advisor to the communications firm Public Strategies, Inc. in Austin and New York. From 1995 to 2001, Richards was also a senior advisor with Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, a Washington, D.C.–based international law firm. Richards sat on the boards of the Aspen Institute, JCPenney, and T.I.G. Holdings.

One of her daughters, Cecile Richards, became president of Planned Parenthood in 2006. Ann Richards demonstrated interest in social causes such as equality, abortion, and women&#x27;s rights.

She was a tireless campaigner for Democratic candidates throughout the United States. In the 2004 presidential election, Richards endorsed Howard Dean for the Democratic nomination, and campaigned on his behalf. Richards later stumped for Democratic nominee John Kerry, highlighting the issues of health care and women&#x27;s rights. Some political pundits mentioned her as a potential running mate to Kerry; however, she did not make his list of top finalists, and he selected North Carolina Senator John Edwards. Richards said that she was &quot;not interested&quot; in a political comeback.

==Teaching==
Richards taught social studies and history at Fulmore Junior High School (now Lively Middle School) in Austin (1954–1957). She continued teaching in later years.

Education was of extreme importance to Richards, especially when it came to solving crime and economic problems in Texas. In November, 1989, she held a campaign speech in Bryan, Texas where she spoke about Texas&#x27; criminal justice and economic system and the work that needed to be done to educate the people in order to create a sustainable environment. Richards put great emphasis on an investment in education to promote jobs in Texas&#x27; high technology fields and break its crime cycles, or else Texas would be in trouble.

She served at Brandeis University as the Fred and Rita Richman Distinguished Visiting Professor of Politics from 1997 to 1998. In 1998 she was elected as a trustee of Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, she was reelected in 2004, and continued to hold the position until her death.

Richards was diagnosed with osteoporosis in 1996, having lost  inch in height and breaking her hand and ankle. She changed her diet and lifestyle, and then her bone density stabilized. She spoke frequently about this experience, teaching or advocating a healthier lifestyle for women at risk of the disease. In 2004, she co-authored &quot;I&#x27;m Not Slowing Down&quot;, with the gynaecologist Richard U. Levine, which describes her own battle with osteoporosis and offers guidance to others with the disease.

In Steve Labinski&#x27;s review, he described the book as inspiring women to fight the disease with various tactics, such as:

* identifying factors that might increase vulnerability to osteoporosis including lack of estrogen, menopause, and usage of drugs related to caffeine, tobacco and alcohol;
* emphasizing the impact of bone-density tests and explaining the process using Ann Richard&#x27;s own bone test as an example;
* supplying an extensive list of calcium-enriched foods which are beneficial, plus noting some foods to avoid;
* listing everyday tips to improve muscle condition and prevent bone injuries.

In the fall of 2005, Richards taught a class called &quot;Women and Leadership&quot; at the University of Texas at Austin; 21 female students were selected for that class.

Before Richards had died, she created a school for women called &quot;the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders&quot;. The school opened on August 27, 2007, with a goal to educate and empower young women, grades 6-12, while creating opportunities for them that may not have otherwise presented themselves. Serving for the Austin Independent School District, the public school began by welcoming 6th and 7th grade classes, adding an additional grade every year from 2007 to 2012. In January 2021, the school moved into a new facility. With Richards&#x27; vision, so many young women who came from disadvantaged backgrounds now had an opportunity and the confidence to pursue their college education and careers. Today, more than 900 students come together to create a community of women who share a desire to become someone great with thanks to the Austin Independent School District, the Dallas-based Young Women’s Preparatory Network (YWPN), and the Ann Richards School Foundation.

==Arts and film==
One of her first legislative requests was to move the Texas Music Office (created in 1990 during the administration of Governor Bill Clements) and the Texas Film Commission (created in 1971 during Governor Preston Smith&#x27;s term) from the Texas Department of Commerce to the Office of the Governor.

Her longtime personal interest in Texas film and music greatly raised the public profile of both industries and brought the two programs into the Governor&#x27;s Office. As a result, these industries were institutionalized as key high-profile parts of Texas&#x27; future economic growth plans. Other of her music milestones include publishing the first &quot;Texas Music Industry Directory&quot; (1991) and her &quot;Welcome to Texas&quot; speech to the opening day registrants of the 1993 South By Southwest Music and Media Conference. She was involved with the Texas Film Hall of Fame from the beginning. At the first ceremony, she inducted Liz Smith. She was emcee every subsequent year but had to cancel at the last minute in 2006 because of her diagnosis with cancer.

Richards said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a friend to Texas film since the number of people who cared about Texas film could have fit in a phone booth.&quot; She was an advocate for the Texas film industry and traveled to Los Angeles to market her state. Gary Bond, the director of the Austin Film Commission, noted, &quot;She was far from being the first governor to appoint a film commissioner; I think she was the first that really brought the focus of Hollywood to Texas.&quot;

She was also a mentor to other women. She advised Rebecca Campbell, executive director of the Austin Film Society, &quot;Whenever you speak in public you&#x27;ve got to tell them what you need from them.&quot; She put the spotlight on film as a genuine industry, brought more focus to Texas, and had a tremendous network of people in the entertainment industry. She gave more focus to film as a business than had been done before.

She was interviewed in the 1996 Ken Burns documentary series &quot;The West&quot; about the history of Texas and the United States in the 1800s. In the film she states that the colonization of the United States required genocide and dispossession, &quot;But even knowing all of that. And wishing that part of it were not there, cannot take away the spirit and idealism and the excitement that people (settlers) felt that actually did it and that we still feel when we think about them doing it.&quot; Richards also appeared in a 2009 documentary film, &quot;Sam Houston: American Statesman, Soldier, and Pioneer&quot;.

It is believed that her last appearance in film was in a short public announcement used at the Alamo Drafthouse, asking patrons not to be disruptive during the film. The Alamo Drafthouse still uses it today, with an addition at the end in honor of Ann Richards.

Richards was active in the Austin City Limits Festivals and the SXSW festival, the interactive music and film festival held each year in Austin.

==Awards and recognition==
During her career, Ann Richards received many awards and honors. One of them being the Baylor Distinguished Alumni which is given to the &quot;alumni who makes an outstanding contribution to biomedical and/or medical science through clinical service, research, education and/or administrative leadership.&quot; Another one is the Texas NAACP Presidential Award for Outstanding Contributions to Civil Rights. The winners get selected by the NAACP president for acknowledge a special achievement and distinguished public service. She was also awarded the National Wildlife Federation Conservation Achievement Award. Ann was also given the Orden del Aguila Azteca (Order of the Aztec Eagle) presented by the government of Mexico. Another being the Maurice N. Eisendrath Bearer of Light Award from the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and finally the Texas Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame honoree for Public Service. Ann Richards was also fortunate to have a public all girls preparatory school in Austin, Texas named in honor of her in 2007.

==Final years and death==
While the events of 9/11 motivated many New Yorkers to leave the city, Liz Smith wrote that it drove the former governor to that city in which she would spend the last five years of her life. She said that she wanted to convey a message that &quot;just because something tragic and life altering may happen, that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re supposed to turn heel and run away.&quot;

In March 2006, Richards disclosed that she had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and received treatment at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Alcohol and tobacco exposure are major risk factors for certain types of esophageal cancer; by her own admission, Richards said that she &quot;smoked like a chimney and drank like a fish&quot; in her younger years.

Richards died of cancer at her home in Austin on September 13, 2006, at the age of 73. Three memorial services were held. Her remains are interred at Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

==Legacy==

The City of Austin changed the official name of Congress Avenue Bridge (which opened in 1910) to Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge on November 16, 2006.

Her 1988 DNC keynote address was listed as No. 38 in American Rhetoric&#x27;s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).

The Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders in Austin, Texas, which Ann Richards helped to create, is named for her. The Ann Richards School, a college preparatory school for girls in grades 6–12, opened in the fall of 2007 in Austin, and continues to celebrate the life and legacy of Governor Richards. She also inaugurated a school in the year 1999 named Ann Richards Middle School in Palmview, Texas.

A tribute to Richards was featured during the &quot;HerStory&quot; video tribute to notable women on U2&#x27;s tour in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; during a performance of &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;.

Richards&#x27; legacy has proven controversial among LGBT groups due to her involvement in the ratification of Section 21.06 of the Texas Penal Code, a measure that Richards had campaigned against in the 1990 Texas gubernatorial election. This law prohibits &quot;deviate sexual intercourse [between] individual[s] of the same sex&quot;. This led LGBT commentator Dale Carpenter to describe Richards&#x27; legacy as &quot;darkly anti-gay&quot; and raise examples of men having been prosecuted for violating the law that Richards had signed. However, Bryan H. Wildenthal, associate professor and director of the Center for Law and Social Justice at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, argued that this legislation was passed despite objections by Richards. Wildenthal added that vetoing the legislation would have resulted in the existing sodomy law remaining in force while sacrificing many other unrelated progressive improvements in the code.

==In popular culture==
In 2001, Richards made a cameo appearance in a fifth-season episode of the Texas-based animated TV series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. In the episode entitled &quot;Hank and the Great Glass Elevator&quot;, Hank Hill moons her, and she begins a brief relationship with Bill Dauterive. She is also seen in the closing credits of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; Season 1 Episode 4, playing tether ball with Willie Nelson&#x27;s roadie.

Richards made a voice cameo in Disney&#x27;s 2004 animated film &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, where she voiced a saloon owner named Annie.

Richards was a topic in the film &quot;Bush&#x27;s Brain&quot; (by Joseph Mealey and Michael Shoob), in a segment regarding her defeat in the 1994 election for Texas governor. The film presents the case that her defeat involved a whisper campaign that the governor was a lesbian, because she had allegedly hired many gays and lesbians to work on her re-election campaign.

In the 2008 Oliver Stone film &quot;W.&quot;, Richards is mentioned during George Bush&#x27;s campaign as &quot;Ms. Big Mouth, Big Hair&quot;.

Richards was one of the characters portrayed by Anna Deavere Smith in her play, &quot;Let Me Down Easy,&quot; which explores illness, death, and the healthcare system. The show opened in 2008, played in cities around the country, and was featured as part of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; series on January 13, 2012.

In 2010, actress Holland Taylor debuted in a one-woman show called &quot;Ann: An Affectionate Portrait of Ann Richards&quot; at the Charline McCombs Empire Theater in San Antonio, Texas. The show was subsequently staged at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and the Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center in 2013. PBS &quot;Great Performances&quot; broadcast the premiere of the play, now titled simply &quot;Ann,&quot; on June 19, 2020. It had been recorded at the Zach Theater in Austin, Texas, following its national tour and Broadway run. Taylor said of her subject, &quot;She was brave, strong, and funny—Bill Clinton has said the wittiest person he&#x27;d ever met!...She ran as a liberal in conservative Texas, so I had to write a play about her four incredible years in Austin... She was ahead of Obama by about 10 years as an &#x27;inclusive&#x27; leader.&quot;

In 2012, a documentary about her political life, &quot;Ann Richards&#x27; Texas&quot;, was released. On April 28, 2014, HBO released a documentary, &quot;All About Ann: Governor Richards of the Lone Star State.&quot;

In 2019, &quot;Call Me Ann: A Rock Opera&quot; debuted in Houston, Texas, at the Houston Fringe Festival.

<doc id="317841" wikidata="Q16997171" url="?curid=317841" title="International Defensive Pistol Association">
<text>The International Defensive Pistol Association (IDPA), founded in 1996, is an organization based in Bogata, Texas that governs a practical shooting sport (IDPA), which is based on defensive pistol tactics, everyday carry equipment, and full-charge service ammunition, to solve simulated &quot;real world&quot; self-defense scenarios. Competitors (shooters) are required to use handguns and equipment (holsters, ammunition carriers) that are suitable for self-defense, and wear a concealment garment tha conceals the handgun and associated equipment from view of bystanders.

The sport came about as a response to the perceived shortcomings in competitions organized by the United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA) and its migration away from the use of common, un-customized handguns. It was decided by the founders of IDPA (Bill Wilson, John Sayle, Ken Hackathorn, Dick Thomas, Walt Rauch and Larry Vickers), that USPSA competitions had become too far removed from the reality of defensive shooting situations, using extensively modified guns, handmade ammunition, and speed-draw holsters that were impractical for self-defense. The IDPA founders believed that USPSA matches had become &quot;equipment races&quot;, which were heavily dependent on a shooter&#x27;s gear rather than their ability.

In order to keep the sport in line with its founding principles, allowable alterations to the competition gear (including pistol or pistol caliber carbine) are carefully regulated in IDPA. Ammunition capacity is limited compared to some other action shooting sports in order to keep the playing field level for competitors from states that ban higher capacity magazines.
==Competition==
An IDPA match consists of one or more stages. A stage presents a course of fire for the shooter to complete. A course of fire consists of one or more strings of fire. A string of fire is a timed segment in a course of fire. The time to complete a string of fire begins with a start signal (typically audible) and ends with the last shot fired. Time is measured by a shot timer, which provides the start signal and records each shot fired.

There are two types of stages: Scenario and Standards. A Scenario stage represents a self-defense situation that could happen in real life. A Standards stage tests shooting fundamentals.

==Scoring==
IDPA uses &quot;Time Plus&quot; scoring. &quot;Time Plus&quot; means the time it takes to complete a stage plus time added for points down and penalties. For a stage, the string times (raw time) plus points down time, plus penalty time are added to determine total stage time. For a match, the total time of all stages is added together. Match placement is based on total time. The lower the time, the higher the placement.

===Points Down===
The official IDPA target is made of cardboard and has a vaguely humanoid shape consisting of a &quot;head&quot; and a &quot;body&quot;. Scoring zones are perforated onto its surface. A &quot;neck&quot; perforation demarcates the &quot;head&quot; from the &quot;body.&quot;

There are 5 distinct scoring zones on an IDPA target: -0 head, -0 body, -1 head, -1 body, -3 body. The &quot;head&quot; is a 6&quot; square with a 4&quot; circle centered within it. The circle is marked &quot;-0&quot;. The area outside of the circle is marked &quot;-1&quot;. The &quot;body&quot; has an 8&quot; circle in the high-center chest, which is marked &quot;-0&quot;. A polygonal area surrounding the circle is marked &quot;-1&quot;. The remainder of the body is marked &quot;-3&quot;.

Only the required number of hits are scored. If there are fewer hits than required, the missing hits are scored as misses, which are &quot;-5&quot;. If there are more hits on a target then required, the best of the required number of hits are scored, subject to the scoring method used (see below).

Scored hits in each zone are added to the total points down. For example: if a target requires two hits, a hit in the &quot;-1&quot; zone and a hit in the &quot;-3&quot; zone would be scored as &quot;-4&quot; and called as &quot;down-4&quot; (or simply &quot;4&quot;).

One second per point down is added to the total time taken to shoot the stage.

===Scoring Methods===
There are two methods of scoring: Unlimited and Limited. Scenario stages must use Unlimited scoring. Standards stages may use either method, although Limited scoring is commonly used on Standards stages.
====Unlimited Scoring====
Unlimited scoring means that the shooter may fire more than the required number of shots at a target. The best of the required number of hits on the target are scored. Extra shots (makeups) are beneficial if they remove more points down than the time it takes to fire them.
====Limited Scoring====
Limited scoring means that the shooter may NOT fire more than the required number of shots at a target. Firing extra rounds on a limited stage will earn a procedural penalty. In addition to the penalty, for each extra shot fired at a target, the highest scoring hit will be removed (taped over) prior to scoring the target. 

For example: a Limited Scoring stage calls for two shots per threat target. The shooter fires one round into the -0 zone and one round into the -1 zone. The shooter then fires an extra shot, hitting the -1 zone. First, the shooter is assessed a PE. Second, the highest scoring hit on the target, i.e.: the -0 hit, is removed, leaving two -1 hits. The final score on the target is &quot;down 2.&quot;

===Penalties===
====Procedural Error (PE)====
A procedural error is a 3-second penalty given for violating the rules of IDPA or failing to follow the stage procedure of a course of fire.

Procedural errors may be assessed by the Safety Officer for infractions such as:
* Faulting a cover line while engaging a target at a Point of Cover.
* Not engaging targets in tactical priority.
* Failing to follow the stage procedure.
* Leaving loaded loading devices behind after performing a reload.

====Hit on Non-Threat (HNT)====
Targets identified with two open hands are considered &quot;non-threat&quot; targets. A hit on a non-threat in any scoring zone will result in a 5-second penalty for each and every hit.
====Flagrant Penalty (FP)====
A flagrant penalty is a 10-second penalty given in place of a PE when the shooter knowingly commits an infraction and gains a competitive advantage that outweighs the 3-second PE penalty the infraction would normally earn.

Flagrant penalties may be assessed by the Safety Officer for infractions such as:
* Shooting with two hands when the procedure requires for one-handed shooting.
* Engaging an entire array of threats while faulting cover.
* Loading more rounds than allowed in the shooter&#x27;s division.

The examples provided in the rule book should not be considered automatic. The Safety Officer must use judgement to determine if the infraction warrants a Flagrant penalty.

Flagrant penalties must be approved by the match director.

====Failure to Do Right (FTDR)====
A failure to do right is a 20-second penalty given for &quot;gross unsportsmanlike conduct&quot;.

&quot;Gross unsportsmanlike conduct&quot; includes unacceptable behavior as well as intentional gross violations of the course of fire.

FTDR penalties must be approved by the match director.

==Equipment==
===Firearms===
IDPA currently recognizes nine divisions of competition, with each division having different limitations for the firearms. The Revolver (REV) and Back-Up Gun (BUG) divisions are further divided into two subcategories each.

In the following table, note that &quot;Max Rounds Loaded&quot; is a general maximum for all competitions. Instructions for a stage may require a lower round count for that stage. In the semi-automatic divisions, this refers to the maximum number of rounds allowed to be loaded in the magazine. Unless stage instructions state otherwise, shooters may start with an additional round in the chamber. Also note that &quot;Other Firearm Restrictions&quot; only lists the most significant firearm restrictions for a division. See IDPA rulebook for an exhaustive list of rules.

===Holsters===
* Holster must be attached to a belt worn through belt loops. All but two belt loops must be used.
* Holster must hold the firearm with enough tension to allow the wearer to complete normal daily tasks without fear of losing the weapon
* Except for law enforcement officers competing using their duty equipment, the holster must be concealable
* Shoulder, ankle, and cross-draw holsters are not allowed due to safety concerns

<text>A cooling pond is a man-made body of water primarily formed for the purpose of cooling heated water or to store and supply cooling water to a nearby power plant or industrial facility such as a petroleum refinery, pulp and paper mill, chemical plant, steel mill or smelter.

==Overview==
Cooling ponds are used where sufficient land is available, as an alternative to cooling towers or discharging of heated water to a nearby river or coastal bay, a process known as “once-through cooling.” The latter process can cause thermal pollution of the receiving waters. Cooling ponds are also sometimes used with air conditioning systems in large buildings as an alternative to cooling towers.

The pond receives thermal energy in the water from the plant&#x27;s condensers during the process of energy production and the thermal energy is then dissipated mainly through evaporation and convection. Once the water has cooled in the pond, it is reused by the plant. New water is added to the system (“make-up” water) to replace the water lost through evaporation.

A 1970 research study published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that cooling ponds have a lower overall electrical cost than cooling towers while providing the same benefits. The study concluded that a cooling pond will work optimally within 5 degrees Fahrenheit of natural water temperature with an area encompassing approximately 4 acres per megawatt of dissipated thermal energy.

== Examples ==
* Lake Anna is a cooling pond in Virginia, which provides cooling water for the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station. This pond has recreational uses such as fishing, swimming, boating, camping, and picnicking as well as being a cooling pond for the nuclear plant.
* The cooling pond at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (Pripyat, Ukraine) has abundant wildlife, despite the radiation present in the area. There are some accounts of wels catfish &quot;(Silurus glanis)&quot; growing up to 350 pounds and having a lifespan of up to 50 years in the area.
* The Columbia Energy Center in Pacific, Wisconsin is a coal fired power plant with a capacity of 1000 MW. A dual cooling system is used for heat rejection that consists of a cooling pond and two cooling towers. The pond and towers are connected in a parallel arrangement to help dissipate thermal energy at expedited rates.
* In 1994 the reactor at Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, North Korea, was under U.S scrutiny and its nuclear fuel rods were taken out of the reactor and placed in the facility&#x27;s cooling pond. The fuel rods have since been removed.
* At the 2.05 MW Ashford A power station Kent, UK, cooling water for the  oil-fired engines was obtained from, and returned to, cooling water ponds. The principal cooling mechanism in the ponds was by convection from the water surface.
* At the 89 MW Back o’ the’ Bank power station in Bolton UK the cooling water was cooled in 4 spray ponds. The small size of the spray droplets improved the heat transfer, increased evaporation, and led to more effective cooling. Each cooling pond had a capacity of 0.75 million gallons per hour (0.95 m3/s). Make up water was abstracted from the nearby River Tonge. In about 1950 a hyperbolic reinforced concrete cooling tower was built with a capacity of 2.5 million gallons per hour (3.15 m3/s), with cooling range of 15 °F (8.3 °C). However, there were complaints that operation of the cooling tower let to problems with ice in cold weather as water vapour from the tower froze as fine particles.
* In 1963 the UK&#x27;s Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) was researching the possibility of using warmed cooling water from power stations to support fish-farming both for recreational use and for food. At Grove Road power station in London water was cooled in wooden natural draft cooling towers and fell into cooling water ponds. The CEGB introduced carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp, silver carp and Tilapia into the cooling water ponds; the fish grew rapidly in the warm water (up to 27 °C).
* Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, has massive cooling ponds with additional water spray.

<doc id="317845" wikidata="Q3361824" url="?curid=317845" title="Lure coursing">
<text>Lure coursing is a sport for dogs that involves chasing a mechanically operated lure. Competition is typically limited to dogs of purebred sighthound breeds. The AKC has a pass/fail trial for all breeds called the Coursing Ability Test (CAT) and a timed 100 yard dash called Fast CAT where the dog&#x27;s speed is converted to points.

==Lure course==

In lure coursing, dogs chase an artificial lure across a field, following a pattern that is meant to simulate live coursing. A typical lure course in the United States is between long. In Europe, as well as the rest of the world, the course length can be over 1000 meters, and often incorporates some obstacles or jumps. The course must have a minimum number of turns in order to simulate prey (the jack-rabbit or hare) changing direction in a chase. The fields can be fenced or not. If a dog is lure focused they will typically follow the lure from start to finish and not run off course. Dogs with some considerable lure experience, termed &quot;lure-wise&quot;, may try to anticipate or &quot;cheat&quot; by attempting to cut off the lure instead of trying to capture the lure using follow, speed and agility. Sighthounds generally have no need to be trained or enticed to chase the lure since the desire to chase is instinctual.

Some breeds do, however, require lure play at a very early age to encourage them to follow an artificial object with enthusiasm. Dogs must be at least one year old to compete; the hard fast turns are tough on a dog&#x27;s developing joints, and intense and frequent competitive lure coursing before the age of 12 months may cause joint problems later in life. Dogs at an earlier age do require a moderate but essential introduction to the artificial chase to: stimulate their normal mental and physical development, to prepare and improve their capacity to perform physically with enthusiasm without hurting themselves - as is the case with the mutual, voluntary athletic play of littermates.

==Qualifying to compete==
In American Sighthound Field Association (ASFA) competitions, a dog must be Certified in order to compete in the Open category of the breed. To certify, a dog must run &quot;clean&quot; (not interfere with the other hound and pursue the lure) with another dog of similar running style and be certified by a qualified ASFA judge. Dogs used for certification do not have to be certified themselves, nor do they have to be a sighthound, and judges can certify two or three hounds at the same time. Hounds do not have to be certified, or have the QC to run in the Singles stake. In American Kennel Club (AKC) coursing, a rule was passed in early 2010, making the certification process similar to the ASFA certification process. A dog must run cleanly against another dog of similar running style in order to earn a QC (Qualified Courser, not a title, but the hound is now qualified to compete in Open competition). Both the ASFA certification and the AKC QC are accepted as qualifiers to run in Open for each organization. In AKC dogs can still earn their JC (junior courser) title by running a minimum of with four turns twice, in two separate trials, under two different qualified AKC judges. The dogs run alone, and once they complete both runs, they earn a Junior Courser (JC) title. The JC title, however, no longer allows them to compete against other dogs.

In Europe, competing dogs need a coursing licence or racing licence for official national and international lure coursing trials, obtained through a racing or coursing club, and are principally run in braces only of the same breed, or run solo.

==Levels of competition==
Dogs are coursed by breed in trios (three) in North America, or braces (two) in Europe. Hounds must run jacketed in yellow, pink and blue in North America, red and white in Europe. Dogs can run alone if there are no other dogs of the same breed or stake entered, but in AKC their scores will not receive enough points to qualify towards a title unless they defeat a hound in a Best Of Breed run which has an AKC annually designated number for each breed to earn a &quot;major&quot; or win Best In Field. Running order is determined by a random draw within their breed and stake. Dogs in North America can compete in open stake, field champion stake (for dogs who have earned the requisite number of points), or veteran stake (dogs over the age of 6 years, except Irish Wolfhounds (5 years), and Whippets (7 years)). There is also a Singles stake where hounds run alone and need not be certified. ASFA has also set up a Lure Coursing Instinct stake which can be run in a regular trial, for any non-sighthound dogs. It is run like the Singles stake, with dogs running the course alone. Each dog runs twice during the trial. The first run is the &quot;preliminary&quot;. After all preliminaries have been run, the course is reversed for the second run, called &quot;finals&quot;. A hound does not qualify for any points or title in ASFA unless they get at least 50 points including both runs. Once all preliminaries and finals have been run, Best of Breed is determined for each breed by stakes run-off or by forfeit. All placements must be determined by total score (preliminary + final), run-off, or forfeit. After the Best of Breed runs, the top dogs from each breed compete for Best In Field to determine the best hound for the trial. Some clubs opt to provide a Best in Event which brings Best of Breed dogs from multiple days to run off. In AKC, rules regarding breeds that may not compete in Best In Field are updated periodically, based on recommendations of the breed club, and provisional or limited breeds also may not run in Best In Field.

==Judging==
===ASFA===
In American Sighthound Field Association trials, hounds receive a numerical score based on speed (25), agility (25), endurance (20), enthusiasm (15), and follow (15) for a maximum score of 100 points. &quot;Follow&quot; means in pursuit of the lure, not the other dogs. Judges will deduct a pre-slip penalty of up to 10 points for the early release of a hound in a course. Judges can also assess up to 10 points penalty for a course delay. Judges can excuse a hound from competition for failing to run, being unfit, coursing another hound instead of the lure, hound or handler interference, or excessive course delay. Hounds can be dismissed for interfering with another hound. Hounds may be disqualified for being the aggressor in a fight on the field.

===AKC===
In American Kennel Club trials, hounds are judged for overall ability (10), follow (10), speed (10), agility (10), and endurance (10) for a maximum score of 50 points.

The AKC also offers lure coursing titles for all breeds through the Coursing Ability Test (CAT). This program is pass or fail. To pass, the dog must complete a or course (determined by breed) with enthusiasm.

===FCI===
In international lure coursing trials in Europe, dogs are judged according to the FCI Regulations for international lure coursing competitions. Lure coursing judges judge the performance of the dogs on the basis of the following five criteria: Speed; Enthusiasm; Intelligence; Agility; Endurance. The maximum number of points to be given for each criterion is 20.

Some European countries (for example, France and Germany) have their own judging systems. Using these systems in international trials is also allowed, as long as the qualifying criteria are within the general FCI framework of rules.

==Titles==

===ASFA===
Once an Open hound receives 100 title points plus either two first placements or one first and two second placements, they earn a Field Champion title (FCh). A hound earns a Lure Courser of Merit title (LCM) each time it earns 300 points and four first placements.

Titles can also be earned in Singles stake.

===AKC===
Once a dog has received 15 AKC lure coursing points, which must include two majors (3 to 5 point at one trial), it will have earned a Field Champion (FC) prefix title. Any dog that has earned the title of Field Champion and has earned 45 additional championship points from the Special or Veterans Stake, shall be awarded the suffix title of Lure Courser Excellent (LCX). The title of Lure Courser Excellent is a cumulative title. Each time a hound accrues an additional 45 championship points, it would be eligible to receive the next title level (LCX II, LCX III, LCX IV, etc.). Once a dog has achieved four qualifying runs (50 point runs) they earn a Senior Courser (SC) suffix title. Twenty five additional qualifying runs after the SC title is earned will results in a Master Courser (MC) suffix title.

===FCI===
At international lure coursing trials, the CACIL &quot;(Certificat d&#x27;Aptitude au Championnat International des Courses de Lévriers)&quot; is given to the first placed sighthound of each breed and sex, provided that it has achieved at least two thirds of the possible total points. If there are less than six dogs per sex entered, only one CACIL is provided; if there are less than six starters per breed, the CACIL is not given. Sighthounds which did not get at least 50% of the points in the first round, will not be allowed to take part in the second round. The title of an &quot;International Lure Coursing Champion&quot; is given to dogs with complete pedigree, which have gained at least two CACIL within more than 12 months in two different countries, and which have earned at least the qualification &quot;Very Good&quot; at two International FCI dog shows.

Since 2002, the FCI holds an annual European Lure Coursing Championship trial. In 2012, the championships were held in Dunakeszi, Hungary, in 2013 in Pouch, Germany, and in 2014 in Luserna (Italy). The FCI European Lure Coursing Championships took place on 6 and 7 June 2015 in Helsinki, Finland.

Many European countries also have their own National Lure Coursing Championships, as well as National Lure Coursing Cup competitions.

==Sanctioning organizations==
In the United States, the ASFA and AKC are the two main sanctioning bodies. Hound breeds eligible for competition include:
*Afghan Hound
*Azawakh
*Basenji
*Borzoi
*Cirneco dell&#x27;Etna
*Deerhound
*Greyhound
*Ibizan Hound
*Irish Wolfhound
*Italian Greyhound
*Norrbottenspets (AKC only)
*Peruvian Inca Orchid
*Pharaoh Hound
*Portuguese Podengo (Medio and Grande) 
*Portuguese Podengo Pequeno 
*Rhodesian Ridgeback
*Saluki
*Sloughi
*Thai Ridgeback (AKC only)
*Whippet
*Silken Windhound(ASFA Only)

Breeds that are allowed to compete in ASFA&#x27;s Limited Stakes are:
*Chart Polski
*Galgo Espanol
*Magyar Agar
*Peruvian Inca Orchid
*Portuguese Podengo (3 varieties that are to be run separately)

Only AKC-recognized breeds can compete in AKC lure coursing trials, but all AKC breeds, as well as dogs registered with the AKC&#x27;s Canine Partners, may participate in the AKC&#x27;s Coursing Ability Test.

For ASFA, hounds must be registered with an ASFA approved registry, such as the American Kennel Club, National Greyhound Association, the Federation Cynologique Internationale, an ASFA-recognized foreign registry or, in the case of Salukis, a critique registration number from the Society for the Perpetuation of Desert Bred Salukis.

In Canada, lure coursing is sanctioned by the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC). In Canada, the officially eligible breeds do not include the Sloughi, or the Rhodesian Ridgeback. An effort is currently underway to get the Rhodesian Ridgeback included in Canadian lure coursing. The Italian Greyhound, although considered a Toy Breed in AKC is now eligible for Lure Coursing as the CKC recognizes it as a Sighthound.

In Europe, international lure coursing trials are held under the auspices of the Commission for Sighthound Sport of the F.C.I. Trials are organised by local lure coursing clubs, which are either directly affiliated with the national member organisation of the FCI or with a national sighthound club, which again is affiliated with the national FCI member club.

Eligible breeds include all breeds of FCI group 10 (Sighthounds):

*Afghan Hound
*Azawakh
*Borzoi
*Chart Polski
*Deerhound
*Galgo Espanol
*Greyhound
*Irish Wolfhound
*Italian Greyhound
*Magyar Agar
*Saluki
*Sloughi
*Whippet

The following breeds of FCI group 5 (primitive type) are also allowed to participate; they can gain most national titles and can also take part in the European Lure Coursing Championship trial. However, they can currently not get the CACIL:

*Cirneco dell&#x27;Etna
*Pharaoh Hound
*Podenco Canario
*Podenco Ibicenco (Ibizan Hound)

Basenji, Podengo Português, Rhodesian Ridgeback, and Hortaya Borzaya may participate on national level in some European countries, but they are currently not eligible for FCI international lure coursing trials.

<text>Thelma Ritter (February 14, 1902 – February 5, 1969) was an American character actress who, known for her strong New York City accent, diminutive size, and plain look, favored working-class roles. She earned a Tony Award and six Academy Award nominations, more than any other actress in the Best Supporting Actress category.

These nominations were for her performances in &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), &quot;The Mating Season&quot; (1951), &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; (1952), &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; (1953), &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959), and &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962). Her other film roles include those in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), and &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962).

Ritter shared the 1958 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for performance in the musical &quot;New Girl in Town&quot; with her co-star Gwen Verdon. She received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series nomination for &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot; in 1956.

==Early and personal life==
Ritter was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 14, 1902, the first child of Charles and Lucy Ritter. Her father was a bookkeeper, later an office manager.

At age 11, Ritter played Puck in a semi-professional dramatic society&#x27;s production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. As a teenager she appeared in high-school plays and stock companies. After initially being rebuffed, she received formal training at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (ADA) upon her graduation from Manual Training High School in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

Although she subsequently struggled to establish a stage career, Ritter decided to take a hiatus from acting to raise her two children, Monica and Joe. Their father, her husband, Joseph Moran, was also an actor. In the mid-1930s, he changed professions, becoming an actors&#x27; agent and then an advertising executive.

==Career==
Ritter&#x27;s first professional experience came with stock theater companies in New York and New England. Her Broadway credits include &quot;UTBU&quot; (1965), &quot;New Girl in Town&quot; (1956), &quot;In Times Square&quot; (1931), and &quot;The Shelf&quot; (1926).

Ritter&#x27;s first movie role was in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947). She made a memorable impression in a brief uncredited part, as a frustrated mother unable to find the toy that Kris Kringle has promised her son. Her third role, in writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1949), left a mark, although Ritter was again uncredited. Mankiewicz kept Ritter in mind, and cast her as Birdie Coonan in &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), which earned her an Oscar nomination. A second nomination followed for her work in the Mitch Leisen ensemble screwball comedy &quot;The Mating Season&quot; (1951) starring Gene Tierney and John Lund. She enjoyed steady film work for the next dozen years.

She appeared in many of the episodic drama TV series of the 1950s and 1960s, such as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, and &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; ‘’Wagon Train’’. Other film roles were as James Stewart&#x27;s nurse in &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954) and as Doris Day&#x27;s housekeeper, Alma, in &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959). Although best known for comedy roles, she played the occasional dramatic role, most notably in &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; (1952), &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; (1953), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953), &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), and &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962), for which she received her final Oscar nomination. Her last work was an appearance on &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot; on January 23, 1968.

==Death==
On January 27, 1969, Ritter suffered a heart attack at her residence in Queens, New York City. She died from a second heart attack on February 5, in New York City, at age 66.

==Legacy==
In 2019, Ritter was listed at number 1 on &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; list of ten women who changed the face of film forever.

==Awards and nominations==
Ritter received six Academy Award nominations during her career, without a win. This ties her with Deborah Kerr and Amy Adams with the second most such nominations among actresses, behind Glenn Close’s eight. Peter O&#x27;Toole also has eight without a win among men. Only Kerr and O&#x27;Toole have received honorary awards from the Academy.

In 1955 Ritter co-hosted the Oscar ceremony, notably trading wisecracks with Bob Hope.

<doc id="317860" wikidata="Q160001" url="?curid=317860" title="Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg">
<text>Victoria Eugenie Julia Ena of Battenberg (24 October 1887 – 15 April 1969) was Queen of Spain as the wife of King Alfonso XIII from their marriage on 31 May 1906 until 14 April 1931, when the Spanish Second Republic was proclaimed. A Hessian princess by birth, she was a member of the Battenberg family, a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt. She was the youngest granddaughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Unlike other members of the Battenberg family, who were accorded the lower rank of &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, Victoria Eugenie was born with the rank of &quot;Highness&quot; due to a Royal Warrant issued in 1886 by Queen Victoria.

==Early life==
Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg was born on 24 October 1887 at Balmoral Castle, in Scotland. Her father was Prince Henry of Battenberg, the fourth child and third son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia, Princess of Battenberg, and her mother was Princess Beatrice, the fifth daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her mother, as the youngest child of the lonely queen, was kept &quot;at home&quot; with the court, which happened to be at Balmoral when she went into labour. Victoria Eugenie was the last grandchild of a British monarch to be born in Scotland until Princess Margaret was born at Glamis Castle in Angus in August 1930.

As Prince Henry was the product of a morganatic marriage, he took his style of &quot;Prince of Battenberg&quot; from his mother, who had been created Princess of Battenberg in her own right. As such, Henry&#x27;s children would normally have been born with the style &quot;Serene Highness&quot;; however, Queen Victoria had issued a Royal Warrant on 4 December 1886 granting the higher style of &quot;Highness&quot; to all sons and daughters of Prince Henry and Princess Beatrice, thus she was born &quot;Her Highness Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg.&quot; She was named for her maternal grandmother Victoria and for her godmother, Eugénie de Montijo, the Spanish-born French empress who lived in exile in the United Kingdom. To her family, and the British general public, she was known by a diminutive of the last of her names, as &quot;Ena&quot;. She was born in the 50th year of Queen Victoria’s reign, so she was called &quot;the Jubilee baby&quot;.

She was baptised in the Drawing Room at Balmoral. Her godparents were Empress Eugénie (represented by Princess Frederica of Hanover), the German Crown Princess (her maternal aunt; represented by the Duchess of Roxburghe), the Princess of Battenberg (her paternal grandmother; represented by the Marchioness of Ely), Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (her maternal aunt; represented by the Countess of Erroll), Prince Louis of Battenberg (her paternal uncle; represented by the Earl of Hopetoun) and the Duke of Edinburgh (her maternal uncle; represented by Sir Henry Ponsonby).

Victoria Eugenie grew up in Queen Victoria&#x27;s household, as the British monarch had reluctantly allowed Beatrice to marry on the condition that she remain her mother&#x27;s full-time companion and personal secretary. Therefore, she spent her childhood at Windsor Castle, Balmoral, and Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She was a bridesmaid at the wedding of her cousins, the Duke (later King George V) and Duchess of York on 6 July 1893.

When she was six, Victoria Eugenie suffered a severe concussion when she was thrown off her pony at Osborne and hit her head on the ground. Queen Victoria&#x27;s physicians noticed &quot;dangerous symptoms&quot;, such as &quot;evident signs of brain pressure, probably a haemorrhage&quot;. Her aunt Victoria, Princess Royal, wrote, &quot;it is so grievous that [Victoria Eugenie] cannot take notice or open her eyes&quot;.

Victoria Eugenie was close to her grandmother Queen Victoria. She reflected that &quot;having been born and brought up in her home, Queen Victoria was like a second mother to us. She was very kind but very strict, with old fashioned ideas of how children must be brought up&quot;. When Victoria Eugenie said, &quot;I think it is time for us to go to bed&quot;, Queen Victoria corrected her. &quot;Young woman, a princess should say, &#x27;I think it is time for me to retire&#x27;. Queen Victoria wrote that &quot;I love these darling children so, almost as much as their own parent&quot; and referred to Victoria Eugenie as &quot;the little treasure&quot;.
Her father died while on active military service after contracting fever in Africa in 1896. After the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, her mother and her family moved out of Osborne House and took up residence in Kensington Palace in London. Princess Beatrice inherited Osborne Cottage on the Isle of Wight from her mother.

==Engagement and wedding==

In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an official state visit to the United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s maternal uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Helena, King Edward&#x27;s sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. Everybody knew that King Alfonso was looking for a suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, another niece of King Edward. As Princess Patricia seemed not to be impressed by the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son&#x27;s choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry&#x27;s mother, and in part because she wanted her son to marry within her own family. Other obstacles to a marriage were religion (Alfonso was Roman Catholic, and Victoria Eugenie was Anglican); and, the potential problem of haemophilia, the disease that Queen Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s brother, Leopold, was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50% probability that she would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.

After a year of rumours about which princess Alfonso would marry, his mother finally acceded to her son&#x27;s selection in January 1906 and wrote a letter to Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s mother, telling her about the love Alfonso felt for her daughter and seeking unofficial contact with the king. Some days later at Windsor, King Edward congratulated his niece on her future engagement.

Princess Beatrice and her daughter arrived in Biarritz on 22 January and stayed at the Villa Mauriscot where some days later King Alfonso met them. At the Villa Mauriscot, Alfonso and his future bride conducted a chaperoned, three-day romance. Then, Alfonso took Victoria Eugenie and her mother to San Sebastián to meet Queen Maria Cristina. On 3 February, the king left San Sebastian to go to Madrid and Victoria Eugenie and her mother went to Versailles where the Princess would be instructed in the Catholic faith: as the future Queen of Spain, she agreed to convert. The official reception of Victoria Eugenie into the Catholic faith took place on 5 March 1906 at Miramar Palace in San Sebastián.

The terms of the marriage were settled by two agreements, a public treaty and a private contractual arrangement. The treaty was executed between Spain and the United Kingdom in London on 7 May 1906 by their respective plenipotentiaries, the Spanish Ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s, Don Luis Polo de Bernabé, and the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, Bt. Ratifications were exchanged on 23 May following. Among other conditions, the treaty stipulated:

The treaty&#x27;s reference to the forfeiture of Victoria Eugénie&#x27;s British succession rights reflected neither any British government censure of the alliance nor any made by her. Rather, it was an explicit recognition of the fact that by marrying (and becoming) a Roman Catholic, Victoria Eugénie lost any right to inherit the British crown as a consequence of Britain&#x27;s Act of Settlement 1701. This exclusion was personal and limited: those among her descendants who do not become Roman Catholic remain in the line of succession to the British Throne.

Despite this treaty, concern about the reaction to the marriage and to Victoria Eugénie&#x27;s conversion among Protestants was accommodated by the British government&#x27;s decision that King Edward need not grant official consent to the marriage in his Privy Council, despite the fact that his niece was a British subject. Although the Royal Marriages Act 1772 requires that descendants of King George II obtain the British sovereign&#x27;s prior permission to marry by Order in Council, an exception exists for descendants of royal daughters who marry &quot;into foreign families&quot;. Although the naturalisation of Victoria Eugénie&#x27;s father in the United Kingdom had been initiated in Parliament a week prior to his marriage to Princess Beatrice, the nuptials were completed before the naturalisation, thus the government was able to take the position that Victoria Eugénie was not bound by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, and therefore the British king had legal authority neither to authorise nor forbid her marriage.

The king did, however, issue a royal warrant which read:

&quot;Our Will and Pleasure is and we do hereby declare and ordain that from and after the date of this Warrant our Most Dear Niece Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena, only daughter of Our Most Dear Sister Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (Princess Henry of Battenberg) shall be styled entitled and called &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; before her name and such Titles and Appellations which to her belong in all Deeds Records Instruments or Documents whatsoever wherein she may at any time hereafter be named or described. And We do hereby authorize and empower Our said Most Dear Niece henceforth at all times to assume and use and to be called and named by the Style, Title and Appellation of &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; accordingly. Given at Our Court of Saint James&#x27;s, the Third day of April 1906: in the Sixth Year of Our Reign. By His Majesty&#x27;s Command. M Gladstone&quot;

Notice of this warrant was gazetted in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; which read:

Princess Victoria Eugenie married King Alfonso XIII at the Royal Monastery of San Jerónimo in Madrid on 31 May 1906. Present at the ceremony were her widowed mother and brothers, as well as her cousins, the Prince and Princess of Wales.

After the wedding ceremony, as the royal procession was heading back to the Royal Palace, an assassination attempt was made on the King and Queen when anarchist Mateu Morral threw a bomb from a balcony at the royal carriage; this incident would become known as the Morral affair. Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s life was saved because, at the exact moment the bomb exploded, she turned her head in order to see St. Mary&#x27;s Church, which Alfonso was showing her. She escaped injury, although her dress was spotted with the blood of a guard who was riding beside the carriage. A large statue in front of the Royal Monastery of San Jeronimo commemorates the victims of the bombing of 31 May 1906.

==Queen of Spain==
After the inauspicious start to her tenure as Queen of Spain, Victoria Eugenie became isolated from the Spanish people and was unpopular in her new land. Her married life improved when she gave birth to a son and heir apparent to the kingdom, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias. However, while the baby prince was being circumcised, the doctors noted that he did not stop bleeding — the first sign that the infant heir had haemophilia. Victoria Eugenie was the obvious source of the condition, which was inherited by her eldest and youngest sons. Contrary to the response of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, whose son and heir by another granddaughter of Queen Victoria was similarly afflicted, Alfonso is alleged never to have forgiven Victoria Eugenie nor to have come to terms with what had happened. In all, King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenie had seven children, five sons and two daughters. Neither of their daughters is known to have been a carrier of haemophilia.

After the births of their children, Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s relationship with Alfonso deteriorated, and he had numerous affairs. It has been said that he had a dalliance with the Queen&#x27;s cousin, Beatrice, Duchess of Galliera, but this is disputed. Then members of the king&#x27;s circle spread rumours that Beatrice had been expelled because of her bad behaviour, which was not true. All this situation was very painful for the Queen, who could do nothing to help her cousin.

Victoria Eugenie devoted herself to work for hospitals and services for the poor, as well as to education. She was also involved in the reorganization of the Spanish Red Cross. In 1929, the city of Barcelona erected a statue of her in a nurse&#x27;s uniform in honour of her Red Cross work (the statue has since been destroyed).

Various Spanish landmarks have been named after Victoria Eugenie. For instance, in 1909, Madrid&#x27;s stately neoclassical bridge crossing the Manzanares River was named after her as the &quot;Puente de la Reina Victoria&quot;. In 1912, the monumental opera house and theatre &quot;Teatro Victoria Eugenia&quot; in San Sebastián, Spain, was named after her. In 1920, she launched the Spanish Navy cruiser &quot;Reina Victoria Eugenia&quot; which was named after her.

She was the 976th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa. In 1923, the Pope conferred upon her the Golden Rose which was the first time this honour had been awarded to a British princess since 1555 when Pope Julius III conferred one upon Queen Mary I of England. She was also granted the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert by her grandmother, Queen Victoria. The Queen was also awarded the Spanish Red Cross Merit Order (First Class) and the jewelled breast star was paid for by a subscription undertaken by the Corps of Lady Nurses of the Spanish Red Cross.&#x27;

==Exile==

The Spanish royal family went into exile on 14 April 1931 after municipal elections brought Republicans to power in most of the major cities, leading to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Alfonso XIII had hoped that his voluntary exile might avert a civil war between the Republicans and the Monarchists. The family went to live in France and later Italy. Victoria Eugenie and Alfonso later separated, and she lived partly in the UK and in Switzerland. She purchased a chateau, the Vieille Fontaine, outside Lausanne.

In 1938, the whole family gathered in Rome for the baptism at the Palazzo Malta of Alfonso and Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s son Juan&#x27;s eldest son, Juan Carlos, by Vatican Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli (who stood in for the dying Pope Pius XI and would himself become Pope Pius XII in a few months). On 15 January 1941, Alfonso, feeling his death was near, transferred his rights to the Spanish crown to his son, the Count of Barcelona. On 12 February, Alfonso suffered a first heart attack. Alfonso died on 28 February 1941. In 1942, Victoria Eugenie was obliged to leave Italy, having become &quot;persona non grata&quot; to the Italian government, according to Harold Tittmann, a U.S. representative at the Vatican at the time, for her &quot;ill-disguised leanings to the Allied cause&quot;.

Victoria Eugenie returned briefly to Spain in February 1968, to stand as godmother at the baptism of her great-grandson, Infante Felipe, the son of Infante Juan Carlos and Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark. Felipe became King of Spain after his father, King Juan Carlos I, abdicated in June 2014.

==Death==

Victoria Eugenie died in Lausanne on 15 April 1969, aged 81, exactly 38 years after she had left Spain for exile. She was the last surviving child of Princess Beatrice and Prince Henry of Battenberg. The funeral was held in the church of &quot;Sacré Coeur&quot;, she was buried in the nearby cemetery Bois-de-Vaux in Lausanne. On 25 April 1985, her remains were returned to Spain and re-interred in the Royal Vault in the Escorial, outside Madrid, next to the remains of her husband, Alfonso XIII, and not far from her sons, Infante Alfonso, Infante Jaime, and Infante Gonzalo.

==Legacy==

After the death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, the monarchy was restored and Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s grandson, Juan Carlos I, became King of Spain; her great-grandson, Felipe VI, is the current king. Her godchildren included the Prince of Monaco, Queen Fabiola of Belgium, and Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duchess of Alba.

Victoria Eugenie left eight important pieces of jewellery written in her will that, following her instructions, would be transmitted privately to the head of the royal family successively to be worn by the following Queens of Spain. The jewellery collection, known as the &quot;joyas de pasar&quot;, includes her Ansorena given to her by Alfonso XIII as a wedding gift in addition to other wedding gift jewellery from the King. She left her other jewels to be distributed between her daughters Infanta Beatriz and Infanta María Cristina –who received Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s Cartier tiara of diamonds set with pearls (or alternatively with emeralds)–. This tiara and other family jewels were added to the &quot;joyas de pasar&quot; collection later. The jewels in the collection are currently the most important of the royal family and are worn by the Queen of Spain on solemn occasions.

A sapphire ring owned by Victoria Eugenie was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in May 2012 for $50,000.
That same year, Sotheby&#x27;s also sold at auction Victoria Eugenie&#x27;s diamond and pink conch shell bracelet by Cartier for the extraordinary price of $3.4 million.

The Kalamazoo Civic Players was established in 1929 and first performed on the stage of the Lincoln School Auditorium. Founders of the theatre included Dorothy Dalton, Norman Carver Sr., Howard Chenery, Ruth Noble, Paul Fuller, Louise Carver, and Jean Huston.

===Timeline===

1931 – The Players move into the Civic Auditorium on Park Street, a gift of W.E. Upjohn to the city. The theatre was state of the art for the time. In October of that year, their first show of the 1931-1932 season was a staging of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Wife&quot;.

1933 – Founding member Norman Carver Sr. was instrumental in forming the Michigan Little Theatre Enclave, later to become the Community Theatre Association of Michigan.

1941 – The Civic was asked by the publishers of Stage Magazine to present a production of one of their plays on Broadway.

1945 – An intern program was created. It was the first of its kind in the nation. The first intern was Betty Ebert, who later married Jack Ragotzy. Together they founded The Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan.

1945 – In order to support the war effort, the Civic began touring productions to outlying communities. This outreach program was an important part of the Civic&#x27;s mission during the war years.

1949 – The &quot;Imaginary Invalid&quot; was staged in an arena style setting. Audience members sat on the stage, surrounding the action. This venture gave a hint of what was to come with the Carver Center.

1950 – The Civic staged its 200th production &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;.

1952 – Norman Carver was elected as the inaugural president of the newly created National Organization of Community Theatres.

1953 – The Civic celebrated its 25th anniversary.

1956 – The tradition of opening the season with a musical began a tradition that continues to this day.

1958 – The Civic Auditorium Trustees built an annex to the auditorium. This new facility, built one block south of the auditorium, was needed to give the players much needed shop and storage space. It also provided a multi purpose space that was used as a second performance area for experimental productions. It also was used as office and rehearsal space for the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra. The trustees honored their manager of 30 years, Norman Carver, by naming the facility after him.

1958 – James Carver joined The Civic staff as a Production Assistant.

1960 – The Civic was the first community theatre in the nation to present &quot;Raisin in the Sun&quot;.

1969 – The Civic entered its first AACT festival. Due to an accident during the performance they were unable to complete their performance. However, because of the quality of the performance they were given an Honorary Mention.

1974 – James Carver was promoted to Managing Director of The Civic.

1983 – &quot;Fools&quot;, having won first place in State and Regional AACT/Fest competition, went on to represent The Civic at the National Festival. It was voted second place in National Competition. This Civic production represented the United States at an international theatre festival in England.

1989 – The Civic presented its 500th production &quot;Our Town&quot;.

1994 – The Civic produced &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;. This was another festival entrant, winning State, Regional, and National Competitions. They also received recognition for both the outstanding performance of the actors as well as design of the production.

1995 – A Capital Campaign was undertaken to fund a complete renovation of the Civic Auditorium as well as the construction of the Suzanne D. Parish Theatre. New electrical systems, rigging, stage flooring, and seating were installed in the auditorium as part of the renovation. Furnishings were reupholstered, and the walls were repainted.

1996 – Ground breaking took place for the new Suzanne D. Parish Theatre. It was built next to the Carver Center.

1997 – The Civic took &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; to Monaco to perform at an international festival sponsored by the Princess Grace Foundation.

1997 – James Carver retired from the Civic.

1998 – August 1998 brought the opening of a multi-million-dollar state of the art arena style performance space. In addition it doubled the shop space as well as giving the ever-growing Civic much needed storage space.

1999 – The Civic&#x27;s production of &quot;Forever Plaid&quot; won first place in State and Regional AACT/Fest competition. The &quot;Plaid&quot; company represented Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Ohio at National competition in Memphis, Tennessee.

2000 - The Kalamazoo Civic Players and the Kalamazoo Civic Auditorium merged to form the Kalamazoo Civic Theatre.

2003 - The Civic&#x27;s production of &quot;Visiting Mr. Green&quot; won first place in AACT/Fest competition and traveled to Wisconsin.

2004 - The Civic celebrated its 75th anniversary with a Gala Reunion Concert, which featured former volunteers that have gone on to careers in regional theatre, film, and opera as well as on Broadway and television.

2005 – The Carver Center was expanded to include a new costume shop as well as new rehearsal and classroom space.

2005 – The Civic hosted AACTFest 2005, the national theatre festival. Over 500 theatre lovers traveled to Kalamazoo to see community theatre productions, attend workshops and make new friends.

2005 – The Civic launched its Senior Class Reader&#x27;s Theatre program with a semi-staged production of Ladies of the Corridor. The SCRT is composed of veteran performers (age 50 and older) who perform learned, but not memorized, lines.

2006 – As part of the newly created Artist-in-Residence program, Broadway performers Ron Schwinn, Jerry Dixon, Peg Small and acclaimed author Alma Bond shared their skills and insights with the Civic staff, guest artists and volunteers. They also played an important role in community outreach, teaching classes and leading group discussion.

2007 – The theatre was chosen as the first community theatre in the country to present a pilot production of the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot;. Naughty and fun, this provocative show broke all attendance records for the Parish Theatre.

==About==
Each year, the Civic season includes both musicals and plays, set in either the Main Stage, or the Parish Theatre. The Civic has been unusual in its ability to maintain both a professional core staff, and a very enthusiastic community involvement. The professional staff has provided a foundation for the consistently high quality of their productions. In addition, there is a great deal of other theatrical activity in the area, leading to the availability of a large number of experienced amateur actors who repeatedly make their appearance on the Civic&#x27;s stages.

The Civic Youth Theatre is also an important group in Kalamazoo County. It does three shows a year. The Civic&#x27;s Youth Education Program is strong and offers camps throughout the summer to encourage today&#x27;s youth to become tomorrow&#x27;s leaders in the arts.

The front of the auditorium was designed utilizing elements reminiscent of a circus tent. The carving around the doorways gives the impression of tent flaps. Built in 1929 the Auditorium features a house capable of seating 500, eccrouetements of imported limestone, and lead crystal chandeliers imported from Yugoslavia.
The Auditorium stage features 40 usable flysets. The proscenium measures 30 feet across and stage depth is 32 feet.

A remarkable feature of the Civic is the Parish theatre, completed in 1998. This is a black-box-type theatre complete with a trapdoor and possibly all way around seating.

<text>Friends United Meeting (FUM) is an association of twenty-six yearly meetings of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in North America, Africa, and the Caribbean. Its home pages states that it is &quot;a collection of Christ-centered Quakers, embracing 34 yearly meetings and associations, thousands of local gatherings and hundreds of thousands of individuals&quot;. In addition there are several individual monthly meetings and organizations that are members of FUM; FUM&#x27;s headquarters is in Richmond, Indiana, with offices in Kisumu, Kenya. Friends United Meeting is a member of the National Council of Churches in the United States of America, and is a global member of the World Council of Churches.

There are five other branches within American Quakerism, two of them represented by parallel organizations (Friends General Conference and Evangelical Friends Church International), the third (Central Yearly Meeting of Friends), the fourth (Conservative Friends), and the fifth (Beanite Quakerism), the fourth and the fifth having no single unifying organization.

After the switching of around 7,000 Friends in California to the EFCI, FUM is the second largest association of Friends in the United States. As of 2010, there were 24,826 members in 258 congregations in the United States. The Friends United Meeting is responsible for much of the growth of Quakerism in Africa and Latin America. Globally, FUM has over 170,000 members, with 75 percent of the Monthly meetings being in Kenya.

FUM has meetings in the United States, Canada, Belize, Cuba, Jamaica, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. FUM is also affiliated with the only Quaker meeting in Palestine, the Ramallah Friends Meeting.

==History==
15 years after the signing on the Richmond Declaration in 1887, Five Years Meeting was established in 1902 by a collection of orthodox yearly meetings.

After World War I, growing desire for a more fundamentalist approach began to split Five Years Meeting. in 1926, Northwest Yearly Meeting withdrew from the organization, leading several other yearly meetings and scattered monthly meetings. In 1947, the Association of Evangelical Friends was formed, which led in turn to the 1965 formation of the Evangelical Friends Association, a precursor to today&#x27;s Evangelical Friends International, formed in 1989.

During the 1950s many yearly meetings in North America reunited and became joint members of Five Years Meeting and Friends General Conference.

In 1963 Five Years Meeting was renamed Friends United Meeting.

== Beliefs and worship ==

There are two other similar organizations within Quakerism, Friends General Conference (FGC) and Evangelical Friends Church International (EFCI); each of these three organizations represent different branches within Quakerism, with the FGC occupying a more liberal universalist theological viewpoint and the EFCI representing an admixture of Quakerism and conservative evangelicalism.

As the largest organization of Quakers, Friends United Meeting is decidedly centrist and contains a wide range of Christian Quaker theological outlooks from very progressive and inclusive views to very conservative and traditional beliefs among individual members, Monthly Meetings or Churches, and affiliated Yearly Meetings within FUM. This has historically led to some friction within the larger organization. FUM also serves a wide range of Quaker worship styles in their Meetings for worship from unprogrammed, which is lay-led and on the basis of silence, to semi-programmed, which is pastor-led and include some elements of a traditional church service in addition to a period of open worship, to completely programmed.

Friends United Meeting considers itself to be noncreedal which allows it to embrace a wide range of Christian Quaker theological viewpoints.

Friends have no creeds—no official words can substitute for a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. These unofficial statements give a general sense of Friends&#x27; faith.
God is love and wants to communicate inwardly with everyone who is willing.
Worship is spiritual and must be Spirit-led.
All people are equal before God and may minister as they are led by God.
Jesus Christ is our present Teacher and Lord, and we seek to conduct church affairs in unity under his guidance
The Spirit of God gives guidance that is consistent with the Bible.

As people respond to the Light of Christ within, their lives begin to reflect Jesus&#x27; peace, integrity, simplicity and moral purity.

<doc id="317873" wikidata="Q777970" url="?curid=317873" title="Xanadu (film)">
<text>Xanadu is a 1980 American musical fantasy film written by Richard Christian Danus and Marc Reid Rubel and directed by Robert Greenwald. The film stars Olivia Newton-John, Michael Beck, and Gene Kelly in his final film role. It features music by Newton-John, Electric Light Orchestra, Cliff Richard and the Tubes. The title is a reference to the nightclub in the film, which takes its name from Xanadu, the summer capital of Kublai Khan&#x27;s Yuan dynasty in China. The city appears in &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, an 1816 poem quoted in the film.

Released in the United States on August 8, 1980, by Universal Pictures, the film was a box-office disappointment, was panned by critics, and was an inspiration (along with &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;) for the creation of the Golden Raspberry Awards to recognize the worst films of the year. Despite the film&#x27;s lackluster performance, the soundtrack album became commercially successful worldwide and was certified double platinum in the United States. The song &quot;Magic&quot; was a US chart-topper for Newton-John, and the title track (performed by Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra) reached number one in the United Kingdom and several other countries. The film has since become a cult classic for its mixture of 1980s music and culture, creative choreography, and special effects that were innovative for the time.

==Plot==
Sonny Malone is a struggling freelance artist in Los Angeles who has failed to find passion in his art. He tears up one of his sketches and throws it into the wind; it drifts toward a mural of nine sisters that suddenly comes alive. The sisters fly across Earth, but one of them roller skates through town and deliberately encounters Sonny. She kisses him before skating away, leaving him confused.

Sheepishly returning to his old job of painting album-cover reproductions at AirFlo Records, Sonny is tasked by his tyrannical boss Simpson with painting a reproduction for a group called the 9 Sisters. The cover shows the mysterious woman whom Sonny had met in front of an abandoned Art Deco-style auditorium. The photographer tells Sonny that the woman was not supposed to be on the cover but suddenly appeared in a few of his shots. After appearing in person, Sonny tracks her across town to the same auditorium, where she introduces herself as Kira but refuses to reveal anything else about herself or her background.

Sonny also meets and befriends Danny McGuire, a former big-band clarinet player and later orchestra leader turned construction mogul. The two befriend each other, with Danny detailing his romantic involvement in the 1940s with a singer who resembled Kira; her departure resulted in his own loss of creative passion. Kira encourages the duo to open a nightclub at the auditorium called Xanadu, and the two begin working together as partners. Sonny and Kira also gradually fall in love, culminating in a magically animated sequence. On the night before the club&#x27;s opening, Kira confesses to Sonny that she is actually Terpsichore, one of the Nine Muses of Olympus. She was sent to inspire the creation of Xanadu, but she cannot stay despite their mutual feelings, as she is forbidden from falling in love with mortals. Sonny becomes upset at the revelation, and Kira departs Earth having fulfilled her duty.

Danny tells Sonny to keep pursuing Kira, encouraging him not to abandon his dreams as Danny had done after his own muse left him. Sonny manages to enter Kira&#x27;s home by roller skating into the Muses&#x27; mural. Inside the realm of the gods on Mount Helicon, Sonny pleads with Kira&#x27;s father Zeus to allow Kira to return to Earth, and Kira&#x27;s sympathetic mother Mnemosyne attempts to influence Zeus. However, Zeus sends Sonny back to Earth. Kira then professes her feelings for Sonny, and Zeus ultimately relents, allowing her to be with Sonny for &quot;maybe just one moment, or forever&quot;. Kira and the Muses perform at the grand opening of the Xanadu club before returning to their realm. Sonny is initially saddened by their departure, but after Danny orders a cocktail for him, he notices that the waitress who served him resembles Kira and begins a conversation with her.

==Production==

Originally conceived as a relatively low-budget roller-disco picture, a number of prominent performers joined the production, which evolved into a much larger project. However, roller skating was retained as a recurring theme, especially in the final scenes of the club&#x27;s opening night.

Earlier versions of the story established that Sonny was the artist who created the mural from which the nine goddess sisters emerge. This provided a much stronger explanation for the Muses&#x27; interest in helping him achieve artistic success. However, continual rewrites and editing during production caused this plot point to be abandoned, except for one line spoken by Sonny as he laments his failure as a freelance artist: &quot;I paint his van... I paint somebody else&#x27;s mural...&quot; This element of the plot was recycled and used in the later stage adaptation. The Marvel Comics adaptation published as &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #17 retained the more strongly emphasized connection between Sonny and the painting.

The plot of the 1947 film &quot;Down to Earth&quot; was used as the basis for &quot;Xanadu&quot;. In that film, Rita Hayworth plays Terpsichore, with Larry Parks as a stage producer. Gene Kelly&#x27;s character, Danny McGuire, previously appeared in &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944). Kelly retired from acting after the film&#x27;s release and died in 1996.

Kenny Ortega and Jerry Trent served as choreographers.

The Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles was used for exterior shots of the nightclub. Sonny refers to the venue as &quot;a dump&quot; and the real Pan-Pacific Auditorium had fallen into disrepair. Danny remarks that &quot;they used to have wrestling here,&quot; which was indeed true of the Pan-Pacific. The building was destroyed by fire a decade later. Xanadu&#x27;s nightclub interior was built on Stage 4 of the Hollywood Center Studios beginning in 1979.

Newton-John recalled problems with the script and the many story changes that occurred during filming.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It has been certified double platinum in the US and gold in the UK. It contained five top-20 singles:

*&quot;Magic&quot;Olivia Newton-John: 1 pop (four weeks), No. 1 adult contemporary (five weeks), certified gold
*&quot;Xanadu&quot;Olivia Newton-John/Electric Light Orchestra: No. 8 Pop (one week), No. 2 adult contemporary (one week), No. 1 UK (two weeks)
*&quot;All Over the World&quot;Electric Light Orchestra: No. 13 pop (one week), No. 45 adult contemporary (one week)
*&quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;Electric Light Orchestra: No. 16 pop (one week), No. 48 adult contemporary (one week), certified gold
*&quot;Suddenly&quot;Olivia Newton-John/Cliff Richard: No. 20 pop (one week), No. 4 adult contemporary (one week)

===Musical numbers===
The album grouped Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s and ELO&#x27;s songs on separate sides of the soundtrack album, and some songs heard in the film were excluded from the album. The following is the actual order in the film:
*Instrumental medley of &quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Away from Me&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot;, over first part of opening credits
*&quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Away from Me&quot; (excerpt) as Danny plays the clarinet on the beach at the break of dawn
*Instrumental underscoring of &quot;Xanadu&quot; with Sonny drawing and painting 
*Extended intro to &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;
*&quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; (ELO) as the Muses from the wall mural come to life
*&quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Away from Me&quot; (excerpt) with Danny again playing the clarinet at the beach
*&quot;Magic&quot; (Newton-John) as Kira and Sonny have their first conversation while Kira is roller skating in the dark auditorium

*&quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Away from Me&quot; (Gene Kelly and Newton-John) Danny and Kira singing and dancing in the ballroom. This song was heavily influenced by Frank Sinatra. This was the last sequence filmed.
*&quot;Suddenly&quot; (Newton-John duet with Cliff Richard) and Sonny dance and roller skate in the recording studio
*&quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot; (Newton-John duet with the Tubes) in the auditorium as Danny and Sonny imagine differing visions of their ideal club. Sonny&#x27;s rock band and Danny&#x27;s big-band female trio merge into a unified whole, leading to agreement on Xanadu as the name of the club
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot; (ELO) during a romantic animated sequence featuring Sonny and Kira as fish and birds (animation by Don Bluth)
*&quot;All Over the World&quot; (ELO) in the &quot;franchised glitz dealer&quot; store (the Beverly Hills Fiorucci store), Danny runs through dance steps and models various outfits
*&quot;The Fall&quot; (ELO) as Sonny finds the Muses wall mural and roller skates through its portal entrance into Xanadu to find Kira
*&quot;Suspended in Time&quot; (Newton-John) after Zeus sends Sonny home and a dejected Kira sings about her love for Sonny
*&quot;Drum Dreams&quot; (ELO) begins the Xanadu opening-night sequence, with Danny leading the group on skates

*&quot;Xanadu&quot; (Newton-John and ELO) short version over closing credits

==Home media==
&quot;Xanadu&quot; was released on DVD on June 24, 2008. The Magical Music Edition features a &quot;Going Back to Xanadu&quot; featurette, the film&#x27;s trailer and a photo gallery. A bonus music CD with the original soundtrack album was included, with no extra tracks.

The film was released on Blu-ray on March 8, 2016. It has also been released in digital high-definition format for download and streaming.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film underperformed at the box office; it grossed only $23 million against a reported $20 million budget, a total that was insufficient to offset all related costs and return a profit.

===Critical response===
Universal canceled press screenings, suggesting that the studio was not confident in the film. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a stupendously bad film whose only salvage is the music.&quot; Roger Ebert awarded the film two stars out of four, describing the film as &quot;a mushy and limp musical fantasy&quot; with a confused story, redeemed only by Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;high spirits&quot; and several strong scenes with Kelly. Ebert criticized the choreography, saying that &quot;the dance numbers in this movie do not seem to have been conceived for film.&quot; He noted that large dance scenes were not photographed well by cinematographer Victor J. Kemper, who shot at eye level and failed to capture the larger patterns of dancers, with dancers in the background muddying the movement of the foreground.

 The German television show &quot;Die schlechtesten Filme aller Zeiten&quot; (English: &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot;) featured the film in its third season. Janet Maslin wrote in her review: &quot;Like &quot;The Wiz&quot;... &quot;Xanadu&quot; is desperately stylish without having any real style.&quot;

A double feature with &quot;Xanadu&quot; and another musical released several months earlier, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, inspired John J.B. Wilson to create the Golden Raspberry Awards (or Razzies), an annual event recognizing the worst in cinema for a given year. Greenwald won the first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director, and the film was nominated for six other awards.

===Accolades===

==Legacy==
===Cult following===
Over the years, the film has developed a cult audience.

Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the book for the musical based on the film, later called &quot;Xanadu&quot; &quot;what happens when you let straight men near the musical... I blame cocaine. It&#x27;s like people say, &#x27;When you hear Ray Charles play, you can hear the heroin?&#x27; When you watch &quot;Xanadu&quot;, you can see the cocaine up on the screen.&quot;

In 2000, an unauthorized stage show titled &quot;Xanadu Live!&quot; was performed in Los Angeles, with actors speaking the film&#x27;s dialogue and miming the songs.

===Stage musical===

A $5 million Broadway musical adaptation of the same name began previews on May 23, 2007, and opened (with Newton-John and songwriter Farrar in attendance) on July 10, 2007, starring Kerry Butler as Kira, Cheyenne Jackson as Sonny, and Tony Roberts as Danny. In the musical, Kira is the Muse Clio, not Terpsichore. Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa co-starred (in a plot twist new to the Broadway version) as evil Muse sisters. The show, which humorously parodied the plot of the film, was a surprise hit, receiving praise for its satirical approach, and was nominated for several Tony Awards.

The original cast recording was released in December 2007. The Broadway production closed on September 28, 2008, after 49 previews and 512 performances, and a successful national tour followed.

<text>The Lord Great Chamberlain of England is the sixth of the Great Officers of State, ranking beneath the Lord Privy Seal but above the Lord High Constable. The office of Lord Great Chamberlain is an ancient one: it was first created around 1126 (in Norman times) and has been in continuous existence since 1138. The incumbent is Rupert Carington, 7th Baron Carrington.

==Duties==

The Lord Great Chamberlain is entrusted by the Sovereign with custody of the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British Parliament, and serves as his or her representative therein. The Lord Great Chamberlain enjoys plenary jurisdiction in those precincts of the Palace of Westminster not assigned to either the House of Lords or the House of Commons: namely, the Royal Apartments, Central Lobby, and the Crypt Chapel. To this end, the Lord Great Chamberlain is responsible for the use, preservation, and occupation of such spaces. In addition, the Lord Great Chamberlain is one of the three commissioners who exercise control and maintenance over Westminster Hall; the other commissioners are the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords and the Speaker of the House of Commons.

The Lord Great Chamberlain performs other less routine functions as custodian of the Palace of Westminster. For example, the Lord Great Chamberlain welcomes foreign heads of state visiting the Palace of Westminster. Likewise, the Lord Great Chamberlain is responsible for attending upon the Sovereign and other members of the British royal family whenever present at the parliamentary estate. In the latter case, the Lord Great Chamberlain is authorised to make any administrative arrangements necessary for delivery of services required by the Sovereign.

However, the Lord Great Chamberlain’s most publicly visible parliamentary role is participating in state openings of Parliament. To this end, the Lord Great Chamberlain receives the Sovereign at the Norman Porch, enrobes him or her with the Robe of State and the Imperial State Crown in the Robing Room, and leads the Sovereign’s procession through the Royal Gallery and the Prince&#x27;s Chamber into the Lords Chamber. It is also the Lord Great Chamberlain who, upon the command of the Sovereign, directs Black Rod to summon members of the House of Commons to attend the House of Lords for the purpose of hearing the speech from the throne.

Parliamentary responsibilities aside, the Lord Great Chamberlain also has a major part to play in royal coronations, having the right to dress the monarch on coronation day and to serve the monarch water before and after the coronation banquet. Likewise, the Lord Great Chamberlain invests the monarch with the insignia of rule during the coronation service. On state occasions like coronations, the Lord Great Chamberlain wears a distinctive scarlet court uniform and bears a gold key and a white staff as the insignia of his office.

The office of Lord Great Chamberlain is distinct from the non-hereditary office of Lord Chamberlain of the Household, a position in the monarch&#x27;s household. This office arose in the 14th century as a deputy of the Lord Great Chamberlain to fulfil the latter&#x27;s duties in the Royal Household, but now they are quite distinct.

The House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, but the Act provided that a hereditary peer exercising the office of Lord Great Chamberlain (as well as the Earl Marshal) be exempt from such a rule, in order to perform ceremonial functions.

==Succession==
The position is a hereditary one, held since 1780 in gross.
At any one time, no single person actually exercises the office of Lord Great Chamberlain.
The various individuals who hold fractions of the office are properly each &quot;Joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain&quot;.
They choose one individual of the rank of a knight or higher to be the &quot;Deputy Lord Great Chamberlain&quot;.
Under an agreement made in 1912, the right to exercise the office for a given reign rotates among three families (of the then three joint office holders) in proportion to the fraction of the office held.
For instance, the Marquesses of Cholmondeley hold one-half of the office, and may therefore exercise the office or appoint a deputy every alternate reign.
Whenever one of the three shares of the 1912 agreement is split further, the joint heirs of this share have to agree among each other, who should be their deputy or any mechanism to determine who of them has the right to choose a deputy.

== History of the office ==
The office was originally held by Robert Malet, a son of one of the leading companions of William the Conqueror. In 1133, however, Henry I declared Malet&#x27;s estates and titles forfeit, and awarded the office of Lord Great Chamberlain to Aubrey de Vere, whose son was created Earl of Oxford. Thereafter, the Earls of Oxford held the title almost continuously until 1526, with a few intermissions due to the forfeiture of some earls for treason. In 1526, however, John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford died, leaving his aunts as his heirs. The earldom was inherited by a more distant heir-male, his second cousin. Henry VIII then decreed that the office belonged to the Crown, and was not transmitted along with the earldom. The King appointed John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford to the office, but the appointment was deemed for life and was not hereditary. The family&#x27;s association with the office was interrupted in 1540, when the 15th Earl died and Thomas Cromwell, the King&#x27;s chief adviser, was appointed Lord Great Chamberlain. After Cromwell&#x27;s attainder and execution later the same year, the office passed through a few more court figures, until 1553, when it was passed back to the de Vere family to John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, again as an uninheritable life appointment. Later, Mary I ruled that the Earls of Oxford were indeed entitled to the office of Lord Great Chamberlain on an hereditary basis.

Thus, the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth Earls of Oxford held the position on a hereditary basis until 1626, when Henry de Vere, 18th Earl of Oxford died, again leaving a distant relative as heir male, but a closer one as a female heir. The House of Lords eventually ruled that the office belonged to the heir general, Robert Bertie, 14th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, who later became Earl of Lindsey. The office remained vested in the Earls of Lindsey, who later became Dukes of Ancaster and Kesteven. 

In 1779, however, Robert Bertie, 4th Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven died, leaving two sisters as female heirs, and an uncle as an heir male. The uncle became the 5th and last Duke, but the House of Lords ruled that the two sisters were jointly Lord Great Chamberlain and could appoint a Deputy to fulfil the functions of the office. The barony of Willoughby de Eresby fell into abeyance between the two sisters, but George III terminated the abeyance and granted the title to the elder sister, Priscilla Bertie, 21st Baroness Willoughby de Eresby. The office of Lord Great Chamberlain, however, was divided between Priscilla and her younger sister Georgiana. Priscilla&#x27;s share was eventually split between two of her granddaughters, and has been split several more times since then. By contrast, Georgiana&#x27;s share has been inherited by a single male heir each time; that individual has in each case been the Marquess of Cholmondeley, a title created for Georgiana&#x27;s husband.

===20th and 21st centuries===

In 1902 it was ruled by the House of Lords that the then joint office holders (Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 1st Earl of Ancaster, George Cholmondeley, 4th Marquess of Cholmondeley, and Charles Wynn-Carrinton, 1st Earl Carrington, later Marquess of Lincolnshire) had to agree on a deputy to exercise the office, subject to the approval of the Sovereign. Should there be no such agreement, the Sovereign should appoint a deputy until an agreement be reached.

In 1912 an agreement was reached. The office, or right to appoint the person to exercise the office, would thereafter rotate among the three joint office holders and their heirs after them, changing at the start of each successive reign. Cholmondeley and his heirs would serve in every other reign; Ancaster and Carrington would each serve once in four reigns.

As the Cholmondeley share and the Ancaster share (held since 1983 by Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 28th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby) are not further split, each of these holders decides in his or her turn to act as Lord Great Chamberlain or to name a person who will act as Lord Great Chamberlain. The Carrington share was divided at his death among his five daughters and their heirs, and has since been further divided, with 11 people holding shares as of September 2022. At accession of Charles III the turn fell to the Carrington heirs who named their cousin Rupert Carington, 7th Baron Carrington, to act as Lord Great Chamberlain. Being descended from the Earl&#x27;s younger brother he himself has no share of the office.

On 6 May 2023, the Lord Great Chamberlain presented spurs to King Charles III as part of Charles&#x27; coronation. The spurs were included among the first English coronation ornaments in 1189 and were used during the coronation of Richard I.

<text>The Lord High Constable of England is the seventh of the Great Officers of State, ranking beneath the Lord Great Chamberlain and above the Earl Marshal. This office is now called out of abeyance only for coronations. The Lord High Constable was originally the commander of the royal armies and the Master of the Horse. He was also, in conjunction with the Earl Marshal, president of the court of chivalry or court of honour. In feudal times, martial law was administered in the court of the Lord High Constable.

The constableship was granted as a grand serjeanty with the Earldom of Hereford by the Empress Matilda to Miles of Gloucester, and was carried by his heiress to the Bohuns, earls of Hereford and Essex. They had a surviving male heir, and still have heirs male, but due to the power of the monarchy the constableship was irregularly given to the Staffords, Dukes of Buckingham; and on the attainder of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, in the reign of Henry VIII, it became merged into the Crown. Since that point it has not existed as a separate office, except as a temporary appointment for the coronation of a monarch; in other circumstances the Earl Marshal exercises the traditional duties of the office.

The Lacys and Verduns were hereditary constables of Ireland from the 12th to the 14th century; and the Hays, earls of Erroll, have been hereditary Lord High Constables of Scotland from early in the 14th century.

<doc id="317886" wikidata="Q172365" url="?curid=317886" title="San people">
<text>The San peoples (also Saan), or Bushmen, are the members of any of the indigenous hunter-gatherer cultures of southern Africa, and the oldest surviving cultures of the region. They are thought to have diverged from other humans 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. Their recent ancestral territories span Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, and South Africa.

The San speak, or their ancestors spoke, languages of the Khoe, Tuu, and Kxʼa language families, and can be defined as a people only in contrast to neighboring pastoralists such as the Khoekhoe and descendants of more recent waves of immigration such as the Bantu, Europeans, and Asians.

In 2017, Botswana was home to approximately 63,500 San, making it the country with the highest proportion of San people at 2.8%. 71,201 San people were enumerated in Namibia in 2023, making it the country with the second highest proportion of San people at 2.4%.

== Definition ==
In Khoekhoegowab, the term &quot;San&quot; has a long vowel and is spelled &quot;Sān&quot;. It is an exonym meaning &quot;foragers&quot; and is used in a derogatory manner to describe people too poor to have cattle. Based on observation of lifestyle, this term has been applied to speakers of three distinct language families living between the Okavango River in Botswana and Etosha National Park in northwestern Namibia, extending up into southern Angola; central peoples of most of Namibia and Botswana, extending into Zambia and Zimbabwe; and the southern people in the central Kalahari towards the Molopo River, who are the last remnant of the previously extensive indigenous peoples of southern Africa.

==Names==
The designations &quot;Bushmen&quot; and &quot;San&quot; are both exonyms. The San have no collective word for themselves in their own languages. &quot;San&quot; comes from a derogatory Khoekhoe word used to refer to foragers without cattle or other wealth, from a root &quot;saa&quot; &quot;picking up from the ground&quot; + plural &quot;-n&quot; in the Haiǁom dialect.

&quot;Bushmen&quot; is the older cover term, but &quot;San&quot; was widely adopted in the West by the late 1990s. The term &quot;Bushmen&quot;, from 17th-century Dutch &quot;&quot;, is still used by others and to self-identify, but is now considered pejorative or derogatory by many South Africans. In 2008, the use of &quot;boesman&quot; (the modern Afrikaans equivalent of &quot;Bushman&quot;) in the &quot;Die Burger&quot; newspaper was brought before the Equality Court. The San Council testified that it had no objection to its use in a positive context, and the court ruled that the use of the term was not derogatory.

The San refer to themselves as their individual nations, such as ǃKung (also spelled &quot;ǃXuun&quot;, including the Juǀʼhoansi), ǀXam, Nǁnǂe (part of the ǂKhomani), Kxoe (Khwe and ǁAni), Haiǁom, Ncoakhoe, Tshuwau, Gǁana and Gǀui (ǀGwi), etc. Representatives of San peoples in 2003 stated their preference for the use of such individual group names, where possible, over the use of the collective term &quot;San&quot;.

Adoption of the Khoekhoe term &quot;San&quot; in Western anthropology dates to the 1970s, and this remains the standard term in English-language ethnographic literature, although some authors later switched back to using the name &quot;Bushmen&quot;. The compound &quot;Khoisan&quot; is used to refer to the pastoralist Khoi and the foraging San collectively. It was coined by Leonhard Schulze in the 1920s and popularized by Isaac Schapera in 1930. Anthropological use of &quot;San&quot; was detached from the compound &quot;Khoisan&quot;,
as it has been reported that the exonym &quot;San&quot; is perceived as a pejorative in parts of the central Kalahari. By the late 1990s, the term &quot;San&quot; was used generally by the people themselves. 
The adoption of the term was preceded by a number of meetings held in the 1990s where delegates debated on the adoption of a collective term. These meetings included the Common Access to Development Conference organized by the Government of Botswana held in Gaborone in 1993, the 1996 inaugural Annual General Meeting of the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) held in Namibia, and a 1997 conference in Cape Town on &quot;Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage&quot; organized by the University of the Western Cape. 
The term &quot;San&quot; is now standard in South African, and used officially in the blazon of the national coat-of-arms. The &quot;South African San Council&quot; representing San communities in South Africa was established as part of WIMSA in 2001.

The term &quot;Basarwa&quot; (singular &quot;Mosarwa&quot;) is used for the San collectively in Botswana. 
The term is a Bantu (Tswana) word meaning &quot;those who do not rear cattle&quot;, that is, equivalent to Khoekhoe &quot;Saan&quot;. The &quot;mo-/ba-&quot; noun class prefixes are used for people; the older variant &quot;Masarwa&quot;, with the &quot;le-/ma-&quot; prefixes used for disreputable people and animals, is offensive and was changed at independence.

In Angola, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;mucancalas&quot;, or &quot;bosquímanos&quot; (a Portuguese adaptation of the Dutch term for &quot;Bushmen&quot;). 
The terms &quot;Amasili&quot; and &quot;Batwa&quot; are sometimes used for them in Zimbabwe.
The San are also referred to as &quot;Batwa&quot; by Xhosa people and as &quot;Baroa&quot; by Sotho people. 
The Bantu term &quot;Batwa&quot; refers to any foraging tribesmen and as such overlaps with the terminology used for the &quot;Pygmoid&quot; Southern Twa of South-Central Africa.

== History ==

The hunter-gatherer San are among the oldest cultures on Earth, and are thought to be descended from the first inhabitants of what is now Botswana and South Africa. The historical presence of the San in Botswana is particularly evident in northern Botswana&#x27;s Tsodilo Hills region. San were traditionally semi-nomadic, moving seasonally within certain defined areas based on the availability of resources such as water, game animals, and edible plants. Peoples related to or similar to the San occupied the southern shores throughout the eastern shrubland and may have formed a Sangoan continuum from the Red Sea to the Cape of Good Hope. Early San society left a rich legacy of cave paintings across Southern Africa.

In the Bantu expansion (2000 BC - 1000 AD), San were driven off their ancestral lands or incorporated by Bantu speaking groups. The San were believed to have closer connections to the old spirits of the land, and were often turned to by other societies for rainmaking, as was the case at Mapungubwe. San shamans would enter a trance and go into the spirit world themselves to capture the animals associated with rain.

By the end of the 18th century after the arrival of the Dutch, thousands of San had been killed and forced to work for the colonists. The British tried to &quot;civilize&quot; the San and make them adopt a more agricultural lifestyle, but were not successful. By the 1870s, the last San of the Cape were hunted to extinction, while other San were able to survive. The South African government used to issue licenses for people to hunt the San, with the last one being reportedly issued in Namibia in 1936.

From the 1950s through to the 1990s, San communities switched to farming because of government-mandated modernization programs. Despite the lifestyle changes, they have provided a wealth of information in anthropology and genetics. One broad study of African genetic diversity, completed in 2009, found that the genetic diversity of the San was among the top five of all 121 sampled populations. Certain San groups are one of 14 known extant &quot;ancestral population clusters&quot;; that is, &quot;groups of populations with common genetic ancestry, who share ethnicity and similarities in both their culture and the properties of their languages&quot;.

Despite some positive aspects of government development programs reported by members of San and Bakgalagadi communities in Botswana, many have spoken of a consistent sense of exclusion from government decision-making processes, and many San and Bakgalagadi have alleged experiencing ethnic discrimination on the part of the government. The United States Department of State described ongoing discrimination against San, or &quot;Basarwa&quot;, people in Botswana in 2013 as the &quot;principal human rights concern&quot; of that country.

==Society==


The San kinship system reflects their history as traditionally small mobile foraging bands. San kinship is similar to Inuit kinship, which uses the same set of terms as in European cultures but adds a name rule and an age rule for determining what terms to use. The age rule resolves any confusion arising from kinship terms, as the older of two people always decides what to call the younger. Relatively few names circulate (approximately 35 names per sex), and each child is named after a grandparent or another relative, but never their parents.

Children have no social duties besides playing, and leisure is very important to San of all ages. Large amounts of time are spent in conversation, joking, music, and sacred dances. Women may be leaders of their own family groups. They may also make important family and group decisions and claim ownership of water holes and foraging areas. Women are mainly involved in the gathering of food, but sometimes also partake in hunting.

Water is important in San life. During long droughts, they make use of sip wells in order to collect water. To make a sip well, a San scrapes a deep hole where the sand is damp, and inserts a long hollow grass stem into the hole. An empty ostrich egg is used to collect the water. Water is sucked into the straw from the sand, into the mouth, and then travels down another straw into the ostrich egg.

Traditionally, the San were an egalitarian society. Although they had hereditary chiefs, their authority was limited. The San made decisions among themselves by consensus, with women treated as relative equals in decision making. San economy was a gift economy, based on giving each other gifts regularly rather than on trading or purchasing goods and services.

Most San are monogamous, but if a hunter is able to obtain enough food, he can afford to have a second wife as well.

===Subsistence===
Villages range in sturdiness from nightly rain shelters in the warm spring (when people move constantly in search of budding greens), to formalized rings, wherein people congregate in the dry season around permanent waterholes. Early spring is the hardest season: a hot dry period following the cool, dry winter. Most plants still are dead or dormant, and supplies of autumn nuts are exhausted. Meat is particularly important in the dry months when wildlife cannot range far from the receding waters.

Women gather fruit, berries, tubers, bush onions, and other plant materials for the band&#x27;s consumption. Ostrich eggs are gathered, and the empty shells are used as water containers. Insects provide perhaps 10% of animal proteins consumed, most often during the dry season. Depending on location, the San consume 18 to 104 species, including grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, and termites.

Women&#x27;s traditional gathering gear is simple and effective: a hide sling, a blanket, a cloak called a &quot;kaross&quot; to carry foodstuffs, firewood, smaller bags, a digging stick, and perhaps, a smaller version of the kaross to carry a baby.

Men, and presumably women when they accompany them, hunt in long, laborious tracking excursions. They kill their game using bow and arrows and spears tipped in diamphotoxin, a slow-acting arrow poison produced by beetle larvae of the genus &quot;Diamphidia&quot;.

===Early history===
A set of tools almost identical to that used by the modern San and dating to 42,000 BC was discovered at Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal in 2012.

In 2006, what is thought to be the world&#x27;s oldest ritual is interpreted as evidence which would make the San culture the oldest still practiced culture today. 

Historical evidence shows that certain San communities have always lived in the desert regions of the Kalahari; however, eventually nearly all other San communities in southern Africa were forced into this region. The Kalahari San remained in poverty where their richer neighbours denied them rights to the land. Before long, in both Botswana and Namibia, they found their territory drastically reduced.

==Genetics==
Various Y chromosome studies show that the San carry some of the most divergent (earliest branching) human Y-chromosome haplogroups. These haplogroups are specific sub-groups of haplogroups A and B, the two earliest branches on the human Y-chromosome tree.

Mitochondrial DNA studies also provide evidence that the San carry high frequencies of the earliest haplogroup branches in the human mitochondrial DNA tree. This DNA is inherited only from one&#x27;s mother. The most divergent (earliest branching) mitochondrial haplogroup, L0d, has been identified at its highest frequencies in the southern African San groups.

In a study published in March 2011, Brenna Henn and colleagues found that the ǂKhomani San, as well as the Sandawe and Hadza peoples of Tanzania, were the most genetically diverse of any living humans studied. This high degree of genetic diversity hints at the origin of anatomically modern humans.

A 2008 study suggested that the San may have been isolated from other original ancestral groups for as much as 50,000 to 100,000 years and later rejoined, re-integrating into the rest of the human gene pool.

A DNA study of fully sequenced genomes, published in September 2016, showed that the ancestors of today&#x27;s San hunter-gatherers began to diverge from other human populations in Africa about 200,000 years ago and were fully isolated by 100,000 years ago.

==Ancestral land conflict in Botswana==
According to professors &quot;Robert K. Hitchcock, Wayne A. Babchuk, &quot;&quot;In 1652, when Europeans established a full-time presence in Southern Africa, there were some 300,000 San and 600,000 Khoekhoe in Southern Africa. During the early phases of European colonization, tens of thousands of Khoekhoe and San peoples lost their lives as a result of genocide, murder, physical mistreatment, and disease. There were cases of “Bushman hunting” in which commandos (mobile paramilitary units or posses) sought to dispatch San and Khoekhoe in various parts of Southern Africa.&quot;

Much aboriginal people&#x27;s land in Botswana, including land occupied by the San people (or &quot;Basarwa&quot;), was conquered during colonization. Loss of land and access to natural resources continued after Botswana&#x27;s independence. The San have been particularly affected by encroachment by majority peoples and non-indigenous farmers onto their traditional land. Government policies from the 1970s transferred a significant area of traditionally San land to majority agro-pastoralist tribes and white settlers Much of the government&#x27;s policy regarding land tended to favor the dominant Tswana peoples over the minority San and Bakgalagadi. Loss of land is a major contributor to the problems facing Botswana&#x27;s indigenous people, including especially the San&#x27;s eviction from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. The government of Botswana decided to relocate all of those living within the reserve to settlements outside it. Harassment of residents, dismantling of infrastructure, and bans on hunting appear to have been used to induce residents to leave. The government has denied that any of the relocation was forced. A legal battle followed. The relocation policy may have been intended to facilitate diamond mining by Gem Diamonds within the reserve.

==&quot;Hoodia&quot; traditional knowledge agreement==
&quot;Hoodia gordonii&quot;, used by the San, was patented by the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in 1998, for its presumed appetite suppressing quality, although, according to a 2006 review, no published scientific evidence supported hoodia as an appetite suppressant in humans. A licence was granted to Phytopharm, for development of the active ingredient in the &quot;Hoodia&quot; plant, p57 (glycoside), to be used as a pharmaceutical drug for dieting. Once this patent was brought to the attention of the San, a benefit-sharing agreement was reached between them and the CSIR in 2003. This would award royalties to the San for the benefits of their indigenous knowledge. During the case, the San people were represented and assisted by the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA), the South African San Council and the South African San Institute.

This benefit-sharing agreement is one of the first to give royalties to the holders of traditional knowledge used for drug sales. The terms of the agreement are contentious, because of their apparent lack of adherence to the Bonn Guidelines on Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing, as outlined in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The San have yet to profit from this agreement, as P57 has still not yet been legally developed and marketed.

==Representation in mass media==


===Early representations===
The San of the Kalahari were first brought to the globalized world&#x27;s attention in the 1950s by South African author Laurens van der Post. Van der Post grew up in South Africa, and had a respectful lifelong fascination with native African cultures. In 1955, he was commissioned by the BBC to go to the Kalahari desert with a film crew in search of the San. The filmed material was turned into a very popular six-part television documentary a year later. Driven by a lifelong fascination with this &quot;vanished tribe,&quot; Van der Post published a 1958 book about this expedition, entitled &quot;The Lost World of the Kalahari.&quot; It was to be his most famous book.

In 1961, he published &quot;The Heart of the Hunter,&quot; a narrative which he admits in the introduction uses two previous works of stories and mythology as &quot;a sort of Stone Age Bible,&quot; namely &quot;Specimens of Bushman Folklore&quot;&#x27; (1911), collected by Wilhelm H. I. Bleek and Lucy C. Lloyd, and Dorothea Bleek&#x27;s &quot;Mantis and His Friend.&quot; Van der Post&#x27;s work brought indigenous African cultures to millions of people around the world for the first time, but some people disparaged it as part of the subjective view of a European in the 1950s and 1960s, stating that he branded the San as simple &quot;children of Nature&quot; or even &quot;mystical ecologists.&quot;
In 1992 by John Perrot and team published the book &quot;Bush for the Bushman&quot; – a &quot;desperate plea&quot; on behalf of the aboriginal San addressing the international community and calling on the governments throughout Southern Africa to respect and reconstitute the ancestral land-rights of all San.

===Documentaries and non-fiction===
John Marshall, the son of Harvard anthropologist Lorna Marshall, documented the lives of San in the Nyae Nyae region of Namibia over a period spanning more than 50-years. His early film &quot;The Hunters,&quot; shows a giraffe hunt. &quot;A Kalahari Family&quot; (2002) is a series documenting 50 years in the lives of the &quot;Juǀʼhoansi&quot; of Southern Africa, from 1951 to 2000. Marshall was a vocal proponent of the San cause throughout his life. His sister Elizabeth Marshall Thomas wrote several books and numerous articles about the San, based in part on her experiences living with these people when their culture was still intact. &quot;The Harmless People,&quot; published in 1959, and &quot;The Old Way: A Story of the First People,&quot; published in 2006, are two of them. John Marshall and Adrienne Miesmer documented the lives of the ǃKung San people between the 1950s and 1978 in &quot;Nǃai, the Story of a ǃKung Woman.&quot; This film, the account of a woman who grew up while the San lived as autonomous hunter-gatherers, but who later was forced into a dependent life in the government-created community at Tsumkwe, shows how the lives of the ǃKung people, who lived for millennia as hunter gatherers, were forever changed when they were forced onto a reservation too small to support them.

South African film-maker Richard Wicksteed has produced a number of documentaries on San culture, history and present situation; these include &quot;In God&#x27;s Places&quot; / &quot;Iindawo ZikaThixo&quot; (1995) on the San cultural legacy in the southern Drakensberg; &quot;Death of a Bushman&quot; (2002) on the murder of San tracker Optel Rooi by South African police; &quot;The Will To Survive&quot; (2009), which covers the history and situation of San communities in southern Africa today; and &quot;My Land is My Dignity&quot; (2009) on the San&#x27;s epic land rights struggle in Botswana&#x27;s Central Kalahari Game Reserve.

A documentary on San hunting entitled, &quot;The Great Dance: A Hunter&#x27;s Story&quot; (2000), directed by Damon and Craig Foster. This was reviewed by Lawrence Van Gelder for the &quot;New York Times,&quot; who said that the film &quot;constitutes an act of preservation and a requiem.&quot;

Spencer Wells&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;The Journey of Man&quot;—in connection with National Geographic&#x27;s Genographic Project—discusses a genetic analysis of the San and asserts their genetic markers were the first ones to split from those of the ancestors of the bulk of other &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens.&quot; The PBS documentary based on the book follows these markers throughout the world, demonstrating that all of humankind can be traced back to the African continent (see Recent African origin of modern humans, the so-called &quot;out of Africa&quot; hypothesis).

The BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Mammals&quot; (2003) series includes video footage of an indigenous San of the Kalahari desert undertaking a persistence hunt of a kudu through harsh desert conditions. It provides an illustration of how early man may have pursued and captured prey with minimal weaponry.

The BBC series &quot;How Art Made the World&quot; (2005) compares San cave paintings from 200 years ago to Paleolithic European paintings that are 14,000 years old. Because of their similarities, the San works may illustrate the reasons for ancient cave paintings. The presenter Nigel Spivey draws largely on the work of Professor David Lewis-Williams, whose PhD was entitled &quot;Believing and Seeing: Symbolic meanings in southern San rock paintings&quot;. Lewis-Williams draws parallels with prehistoric art around the world, linking in shamanic ritual and trance states.

===Films and music===
A 1969 film, &quot;Lost in the Desert,&quot; features a small boy, stranded in the desert, who encounters a group of wandering San. They help him and then abandon him as a result of a misunderstanding created by the lack of a common language and culture. The film was directed by Jamie Uys, who returned to the San a decade later with &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy,&quot; which proved to be an international hit. This comedy portrays a Kalahari San group&#x27;s first encounter with an artifact from the outside world (a Coca-Cola bottle). By the time this movie was made, the ǃKung had recently been forced into sedentary villages, and the San hired as actors were confused by the instructions to act out inaccurate exaggerations of their almost abandoned hunting and gathering life.

&quot;Eh Hee&quot; by Dave Matthews Band was written as an evocation of the music and culture of the San. In a story told to the Radio City audience (an edited version of which appears on the DVD version of &quot;Live at Radio City&quot;), Matthews recalls hearing the music of the San and, upon asking his guide what the words to their songs were, being told that &quot;there are no words to these songs, because these songs, we&#x27;ve been singing since before people had words.&quot; He goes on to describe the song as his &quot;homage to meeting... the most advanced people on the planet.&quot;
===Memoirs===
In Peter Godwin&#x27;s biography &quot;When A Crocodile Eats the Sun&quot;, he mentions his time spent with the San for an assignment. His title comes from the San&#x27;s belief that a solar eclipse occurs when a crocodile eats the sun.

===Novels===

Laurens van der Post&#x27;s two novels, &quot;A Story Like The Wind&quot; (1972) and its sequel, &quot;A Far Off Place&quot; (1974), made into a 1993 film, are about a white boy encountering a wandering San and his wife, and how the San&#x27;s life and survival skills save the white teenagers&#x27; lives in a journey across the desert.

James A. Michener&#x27;s &quot;The Covenant&quot; (1980), is a work of historical fiction centered on South Africa. The first section of the book concerns a San community&#x27;s journey set roughly in 13,000 BC.

In Wilbur Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;The Burning Shore&quot; (an instalment in the Courtneys of Africa book series), the San people are portrayed through two major characters, O&#x27;wa and H&#x27;ani; Smith describes the San&#x27;s struggles, history, and beliefs in great detail. San characters also appear in many of his other books, often working as trackers and guides for Smith&#x27;s main characters.

Norman Rush&#x27;s 1991 novel Mating features an encampment of Basarwa near the (imaginary) Botswana town where the main action is set.

Tad Williams&#x27;s epic &quot;Otherland&quot; series of novels features a South African San named ǃXabbu, whom Williams confesses to be highly fictionalized, and not necessarily an accurate representation. In the novel, Williams invokes aspects of San mythology and culture.

In 2007, David Gilman published &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Breath&quot;. One of the main characters, a small San boy named ǃKoga, uses traditional methods to help the character Max Gordon travel across Namibia.

Alexander McCall Smith has written a series of episodic novels set in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. The fiancé of the protagonist of &quot;The No. 1 Ladies&#x27; Detective Agency&quot; series, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, adopts two orphaned San children, sister and brother Motholeli and Puso.

The San feature in several of the novels by Michael Stanley (the &quot;nom de plume&quot; of Michael Sears and Stanley Trollip), particularly in &quot;Death of the Mantis&quot;.

In Christopher Hope&#x27;s book &quot;Darkest England&quot;, the San hero, David Mungo Booi, is tasked by his fellow tribesmen with asking the Queen for the protection once promised, and to evaluate the possibility of creating a colony on the island. He discovered England in the manner of 19th century Western explorers.

<text>Aberystwyth University () is a public research university in Aberystwyth, Wales. Aberystwyth was a founding member institution of the former federal University of Wales. The university has over 8,000 students studying across three academic faculties and 17 departments.

Founded in 1872 as University College Wales, Aberystwyth, it became a founder member of the University of Wales in 1894, and changed its name to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. In the mid-1990s, the university again changed its name to become the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. On 1 September 2007, the University of Wales ceased to be a federal university and Aberystwyth University became independent again. The annual income of the institution for 2022–2023 was £130.8 million of which £22.2 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £127.8 million.

== History ==


In the middle of the 19th century, eminent Welsh people were advocating the establishment of a university in the principality of Wales. One of these, Thomas Nicholas, whose book, &quot;Middle and High Class Schools, and University Education for Wales&quot; (1863), is said to have &quot;exerted great influence on educated Welshmen&quot;.

Funded through public and private subscriptions, and with five regional committees (London, Manchester, Liverpool, North and South Wales) guaranteeing funds for the first three years&#x27; running costs, the university opened in October 1872 with 26 students. Thomas Charles Edwards was the principal. In October 1875, chapels in Wales raised the next tranche of funds from over 70,000 contributors. Until 1893, when the college joined the University of Wales as a founder member, students applying to Aberystwyth sat the University of London&#x27;s entrance exams. Women were admitted in 1884.

In 1885, a fire damaged what is now known as the Old College, Aberystwyth, and in 1897 the first 14 acres of what became the main Penglais campus were purchased. Incorporated by royal charter in 1893, the university installed Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, as chancellor in 1896, the same year it awarded an honorary degree to the former British prime minister, William Gladstone.

The university&#x27;s coat of arms dates from the 1880s. The shield features two red dragons to symbolise Wales, and an open book to symbolise learning. The crest, an eagle or phoenix above a flaming tower, may signify the college&#x27;s rebirth after the 1885 fire. The motto is (&#x27;a world without knowledge is no world at all&#x27;).

In the early 1900s, the university added courses that included law, applied mathematics, pure mathematics and botany. The Department for International Politics, which Aberystwyth says is the oldest such department in the world, was founded in 1919. By 1977, the university&#x27;s staff included eight Fellows of the Royal Society, such as Gwendolen Rees, the first Welsh woman to be elected an FRS.

The Department of Sports and Exercise Science was established in 2000. Joint honours psychology degrees were introduced in September 2007, and single honours psychology in 2009.

The chancellor of the university is The Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, who took up the position in January 2018. The visitor of the university is an appointment made by the privy council, under the royal charter of the university. Since July 2014, the holder of this office is Mr Justice Sir Roderick Evans KC.

In 2011, the university appointed a new vice chancellor under whom the academic departments were restructured as larger subject-themed institutes.

In 2022, the university celebrated its 150th anniversary, being established in 1872 (known at the time as The University College of Wales).

====Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences====
The Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS) is a research and teaching centre which brings together staff from the Institutes of Rural Sciences and Biological Sciences and the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER). Around 360 research, teaching and support staff conduct basic, strategic and applied research in biology.

The institute is located in two areas; one at the main teaching Penglais campus and another rural research hub at the Gogerddan campus.

====Aberystwyth Business School====
In 1998, the Department of Economics (founded in 1912), the Department of Accounting and Finance (founded in 1979) and the Centre for Business Studies merged to create the School of Management and Business. In 2013, the School joined the Department of Information Studies and the Department of Law and Criminology at a new campus at Llanbadarn Fawr. The school was shortlisted for &quot;Business School of the Year&quot; in the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; Awards (2014). In 2016, the institute, minus the Department of Information Studies, was renamed the Institute of Business and Law, the remaining departments being renamed Aberystwyth Business School and Aberystwyth Law School.

====Department of Computer Science====

The Department of Computer Science (founded in 1970), conducts research in automated reasoning, computational biology, vision graphics and visualisation and intelligent robotics.

AberMUD, the first popular internet-based MUD, was written in the department by then-student Alan Cox. Jan Pinkava, another graduate, won an Oscar for his short animated film &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot;.

====Department of Geography and Earth Sciences====
The Department of Geography and Earth Sciences (IGES) was formed, in 1989, from the former Departments of Geography (established in 1918) and Geology. It houses the E. G. Bowen map library, containing 80,000 maps and 500 atlases.

====Department of Information Studies====
The College of Librarianship Wales (CLW) was established at Llanbadarn Fawr in 1964, in response to a recommendation for the training of bilingual librarians that was made in the Bourdillon Report on &quot;Standards of public library service in England&quot; (HMSO, 1962). The college grew rapidly, developing close links to the Welsh speaking and professional communities, acquiring an international reputation and pioneering flexible and distance learning courses. It claimed to be Europe&#x27;s largest institution for training librarians. The independent college merged with the university in August 1989 and the department moved to the Penglais campus a quarter of a century later. Following the merger, the new department took over responsibility for existing offerings in archives administration and modern records management.

====Department of International Politics====

The Department of International Politics is the oldest of its kind in the world. It was founded, shortly after the First World War in 1919, with the stated purpose of furthering political understanding of the world in the hope of avoiding such conflicts in the future. This goal led to the creation of the Woodrow Wilson Chair of International Politics, with Wilson having played a significant role in its creation. The department has over 700 students from 40 countries studying at undergraduate, masters and PhD levels. It achieved a 95% score for student satisfaction in the 2016 National Student Survey, placing it as the highest-ranking politics department in Wales and within the UK&#x27;s top ten.

The department has hosted notable academic staff in the field including E. H. Carr, Leopold Kohr, Andrew Linklater, Ken Booth, Steve Smith, Michael Cox, Michael MccGwire, Jenny Edkins and Colin J. McInnes.

====Department of Law and Criminology====
The Department of Law and Criminology (founded in 1901) is housed in the Hugh Owen Building on the Penglais campus, and includes the &quot;Centre for Welsh Legal Affairs&quot;, a specialist research centre. All academic staff are engaged in research, and the &quot;International Journal of Biosciences and the Law&quot; and the &quot;Cambrian Law Review&quot; are edited in the department. In 2013, the department joined the Department of Information Studies and the School of Management and Business at a new campus at Llanbadarn Fawr, as part of a newly created Institute of Management, Law and Information Studies. In September 2018, the department moved back to the Hugh Owen Building, based in the Penglais campus, and its name changed from Aberystwyth Law School to the Department of Law and Criminology.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; University Guide 2018 ranked the Law Department at 69th in the UK, and &quot;The Times&quot; Higher Education Guide ranks it as 300th globally.

====Department of Modern Languages====
Aberystwyth has taught modern languages since 1874. French, German, Italian and Spanish courses are taught at both beginners&#x27; and advanced levels, in a research-active academic environment. One of its research projects is the &quot;Anglo-Norman Dictionary&quot;, based in Aberystwyth since 2001 and available online since 2005.

====Department of Physics====
Physics was first taught at Aberystwyth as part of Natural Philosophy, Astronomy and Mathematics under N. R. Grimley, soon after the foundation of the University College. It became a department in 1877, under the leadership of F. W. Rudler. The department was located in the south wing of what is now the Old College, but later moved to the Physics Building on the Penglais Campus. The first chair in Physics was offered to D. E. Jones in 1885. Before the First World War, much of the early research in the department was undertaken in Germany. Early research in the 1900s was concerned with electrical conductivity and quantum theory, later moving into thermal conductivity and acoustics. In 1931, the department hosted the Faraday Centenary Exhibition. E. J. Williams was appointed to the Chair of Physics in 1938 where he continued his research into sub-atomic particles using a cloud chamber. Following the Second World War, research was concerned with mechanical and nuclear physics, later moving into the fields of air density, experimental rocket launching equipment and radar.
====Department of Psychology====
In 2007, Aberystwyth established psychology as a &quot;Centre for Applied Psychology&quot; within the Department of International Politics. By 2011, psychology had moved into its current premises in Penbryn 5 on the Penglais Campus. The department has over 550 undergraduate students, with degrees accredited by the British Psychological Society and is home to an MSc in Behaviour Change.

==Campuses==
=== Penglais ===
The main campus of the university is situated on Penglais Hill, overlooking the town of Aberystwyth and Cardigan Bay, and comprises most of the university buildings, Arts Centre, Students&#x27; Union, and many of the student residences. Just below Penglais Campus is the National Library of Wales, one of Britain&#x27;s five legal deposit libraries. The landscaping of the Penglais Campus is historically significant and is listed at Grade II* on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. The CADW listing states, 

=== Llanbadarn ===
The Llanbadarn Centre is located approximately one mile to the east of the Penglais Campus, near Llanbadarn Fawr, overlooking the town and Cardigan Bay to the west, with the backdrop of the Cambrian Mountains to the east. Llanbadarn Centre hosted Aberystwyth Law School and Aberystwyth Business School, which together formed the Institute of Business and Law. The Department of Information Studies is also based there. Additionally, the Llanbadarn Campus is the site of the Aberystwyth branch of Coleg Ceredigion (a further education college, and not part of the university).

=== Goggerddan ===
At Gogerddan, on the outskirts of town is located the university&#x27;s major centre for research in land based sciences and the main centre for the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Science.

=== School of Art, Edward Davies Building ===

The School of Art is located between the Penglais Campus and the centre of Aberystwyth, in what was originally the Edward Davies Memorial Chemistry Laboratories. A listed building, the Edward Davies Building is one of the finest examples of architecture in Aberystwyth.

=== Old College ===

The site of the original university is the Old College, currently the subject of the &quot;New Life for Old College&quot; project which aims to transform it into an integrated centre of heritage, culture, learning and knowledge exchange.

=== Aberystwyth Mauritius ===
The university opened an international campus in Mauritius in 2015 operating as &quot;Aberystwyth University (Mauritian Branch Campus)&quot; and registered with the Tertiary Education Commission of Mauritius, but closed it to new enrolments two years later due to low enrolment numbers. Less than 200 students enrolled with the Mauritius campus, which had the capacity for 2,000 students, before its 2018 closure and the university lost more than a million pounds as a result of the venture.

===Student residences===
Most of the student residences are on campus, with the rest in walking distance of the campus and Aberystwyth town centre. Accommodation ranges from &quot;traditional&quot; catered residences to en-suite self-catered accommodation, and from budget rooms to more luxurious studio apartments. All have wired access to the university&#x27;s computer network and a support network of residential tutors.

====Penglais Campus====
*Cwrt Mawr (self-catered flats, single rooms, capacity 503)
* (Welsh speaking traditional catered hall, refurbished in 2020, capacity 200)
*Penbryn (Welsh-speaking traditional catered hall, capacity 350)
*Rosser (self-catered en-suite flats, capacity 336), 
*Rosser G (postgraduate flats following 2011 expansion to Rosser, capacity 60)
*Trefloyne (self-catered flats, capacity 147)

==== Pentre Jane Morgan (Student Village)====
*Almost 200 individual houses arranged in closes and cul-de-sacs. Each house typically accommodates five or six students. The total capacity is 1,003.

==== Fferm Penglais Student Residence====
* Purpose-built student accommodation with studio apartments and en-suite bedrooms (total capacity 1,000). An area of accommodation within the Fferm Penglais Student Residence is set aside for students who are Welsh learners or fluent Welsh speakers and who wish to live in a Welsh speaking environment.

==== Town accommodation====
*Seafront Residences (self-catered flats located on the seafront and Queen&#x27;s Road, overall capacity 361). The original Seafront residences, Plyn&#x27; and Caerleon, were destroyed by fire in 1998. 
*Seafront residences include Aberglasney, Balmoral, Blaenwern, Caerleon, Carpenter, Pumlumon, Ty Glyndwr, and Ty Gwerin Halls.

The university also owns several houses, such as Penglais Farmhouse (adjacent to Pentre Jane Morgan) and flats in Waun Fawr, which are let on an assured shorthold tenure to students with families. Disabled access rooms are available within the existing student village.

==Reputation and academic profile==
Aberystwyth University is placed in the UK&#x27;s top 40 universities in the main national rankings. It is ranked 38th for 132 UK university rankings in &quot;The Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide&quot; for 2023, and the first university to be given the prestigious award &quot;University of the year for teaching quality&quot; for two consecutive years, in 2018 and 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.machynlleth-today.co.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; placed it in the 301—350 group for 800 university rankings, compared with 351—400 the previous year, and the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; placed it at the 432nd position for 2019, compared with 481—490 of the previous year. In 2015, UK employers from &quot;predominantly business, IT and engineering sectors&quot; listed Aberystwyth equal 49th in their 62-place employability rankings for UK graduates, according to a &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; report.

Aberystwyth University was rated in the top ten of UK higher education institutions for overall student satisfaction in the 2016 National Student Survey (NSS).

Aberystwyth University was shortlisted in four categories in the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; Leadership and Management Awards (THELMAs) (2015).

Aberystwyth University has been awarded the Silver Award under the Corporate Health Standard (CHS), the quality mark for workplace health promotion run by Welsh Government.

The university has been awarded an Athena SWAN Charter Award, recognising commitment to advancing women&#x27;s careers in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM) in higher education and research.

In 2007, the university came under criticism for its record on sustainability, ranking 97th out of 106 UK higher education institutions in that year&#x27;s Green League table. In 2012 the university was listed in the table&#x27;s &quot;Failed, no award&quot; section, ranking equal 132nd out of 145. In 2013 it ranked equal 135th out of 143, and was listed again as &quot;Failed, no award&quot;.

Following the university&#x27;s initiatives to address sustainability, it received an EcoCampus Silver Phase award in October 2014.

In October 2015, the university&#x27;s Penglais Campus became the first university campus in Wales to achieve the Green Flag Award. The Green Flag Award is a UK-wide partnership, delivered in Wales by Keep Wales Tidy with support from Natural Resources Wales, and is the mark of a high quality park or green space.

In 2013, the University and College Union alleged bullying behaviour by Aberystwyth University managers, and said staff were fearful for their jobs. The university president, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, said in a BBC radio interview, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe the views set out are representative and I don&#x27;t recognise the picture.&quot; He also said, &quot;Due process is rigorously applied in Aberystwyth.&quot; The economist John Cable resigned his &quot;emeritus&quot; professorship, describing the university&#x27;s management as &quot;disproportionate, aggressive and confrontational&quot;. The singer Peter Karrie resigned his honorary fellowship in protest, he said, at the apparent determination to &quot;ruin one of the finest arts centres in the country&quot;, and because he was &quot;unable to support any regime that can treat their staff in such a cruel and appalling manner&quot;.

In Autumn 2024, students protested the reduction of opening hours at Hugh Owen Library, a cost-cutting measure. Students argued that the university had continued to promote their 24/7 Library until recent open days, and that they were going back on promises which had attracted many students to the University. The University initially met with students to discuss options to restore the library&#x27;s original opening hours, but later rejected further requests for meetings, and refused to negotiate any further.

<text>A clothes dryer (tumble dryer, drying machine, or simply dryer) is a powered household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of clothing, bedding and other textiles, usually after they are washed in the washing machine.

Many dryers consist of a rotating drum called a &quot;tumbler&quot; through which heated air is circulated to evaporate moisture while the tumbler is rotated to maintain air space between the articles. Using such a machine may cause clothes to shrink or become less soft (due to loss of short soft fibers). A simpler non-rotating machine called a &quot;drying cabinet&quot; may be used for delicate fabrics and other items not suitable for a tumble dryer. Other machines include steam to de-shrink clothes and avoid ironing.

==Tumble dryers==
Tumble dryers continuously draw in the ambient air around them and heat it before passing it through the tumbler. The resulting hot, humid air is usually vented outside to make room for more air to continue the drying process.

Tumble dryers are sometimes integrated with a washing machine, in the form of washer-dryer combos, which are essentially a front loading washing machine with an integrated dryer or (in the US) a laundry center, which stacks the dryer on top of the washer and integrates the controls for both machines into a single control panel. Often the washer and dryer functions will have a different capacity, with the dryer usually having a lower capacity than the washer. Tumble dryers can also be top loading, in which the drum is loaded from the top of the machine and the drum&#x27;s end supports are in the left and right sides, instead of the more conventional front and rear. They can be as thin as in width, and may include detachable stationary racks for drying items like plush toys and footwear.

==Ventless dryers==

===Spin dryers===

These centrifuge machines simply spin their drums much faster than a typical washer could, in order to extract additional water from the load. They may remove more water in two minutes than a heated tumbler dryer can in twenty, thus saving significant amounts of time and energy. Although spinning alone will not completely dry clothing, this additional step saves a worthwhile amount of time and energy for large laundry operations such as those of hospitals.

===Condenser dryers===
Just as in a tumble dryer, condenser or condensation dryers pass heated air through the load. However, instead of exhausting this air, the dryer uses a heat exchanger to cool the air and condense the water vapor into either a drain pipe or a collection tank. The drier air is run through the loop again. The heat exchanger typically uses ambient air as its coolant, therefore the heat produced by the dryer will go into the immediate surroundings instead of the outside, increasing the room temperature. In some designs, cold water is used in the heat exchanger, eliminating this heating, but requiring increased water usage.

In terms of energy use, condenser dryers typically require around 2 kilowatt hours (kW⋅h) of energy per average load.

Because the heat exchange process simply cools the internal air using ambient air (or cold water in some cases), it will not dry the air in the internal loop to as low a level of humidity as typical fresh, ambient air. As a consequence of the increased humidity of the air used to dry the load, this type of dryer requires somewhat more time than a tumble dryer. Condenser dryers are a particularly attractive option where long, intricate ducting would be required to vent the dryer.

===Heat pump dryers===
A closed-cycle heat pump clothes dryer uses a heat pump to dehumidify the processing air. Such dryers typically use under half the energy per load of a condenser dryer.

Whereas condensation dryers use a passive heat exchanger cooled by ambient air, these dryers use a heat pump. The hot, humid air from the tumbler is passed through a heat pump where the cold side condenses the water vapor into either a drain pipe or a collection tank and the hot side reheats the air afterward for re-use. In this way not only does the dryer avoid the need for ducting, but it also conserves much of its heat within the dryer instead of exhausting it into the surroundings. Heat pump dryers can, therefore, use up to 50% less energy required by either condensation or conventional electric dryers. Heat pump dryers use about 1 kW⋅h of energy to dry an average load instead of 2 kW⋅h for a condenser dryer, or from 3 to 9 kW⋅h, for a conventional electric dryer. Domestic heat pump dryers are designed to work in typical ambient temperatures from . Below , drying times significantly increase.

As with condensation dryers, the heat exchanger will not dry the internal air to as low a level of humidity as the typical ambient air. With respect to ambient air, the higher humidity of the air used to dry the clothes has the effect of increasing drying times; however, because heat pump dryers conserve much of the heat of the air they use, the already-hot air can be cycled more quickly, possibly leading to shorter drying times than tumble dryers, depending on the model.

===Mechanical steam compression dryers===
A new type of dryer in development, these machines are a more advanced version of heat pump dryers. Instead of using hot air to dry the clothing, mechanical steam compression dryers use water recovered from the clothing in the form of steam. First, the tumbler and its contents are heated to . The wet steam that results purges the system of air and is the only remaining atmosphere in the tumbler.

As wet steam exits the tumbler, it is mechanically compressed (hence the name) to extract water vapor and transfer the heat of vaporization to the remaining gaseous steam. This pressurized, gaseous steam is then allowed to expand, and is superheated before being injected back into the tumbler where its heat causes more water to vaporize from the clothing, creating more wet steam and restarting the cycle.

Like heat pump dryers, mechanical steam compression dryers recycle much of the heat used to dry the clothes, and they operate in a very similar range of efficiency as heat pump dryers. Both types can be over twice as efficient as conventional tumble dryers. The considerably higher temperatures used in mechanical steam compression dryers result in drying times on the order of half as long as those of heat pump dryers.

===Convectant drying===
Marketed by some manufacturers as a &quot;static clothes drying technique&quot;, convectant dryers simply consist of a heating unit at the bottom, a vertical chamber, and a vent at top. The unit heats air at the bottom, reducing its relative humidity, and the natural tendency of hot air to rise brings this low-humidity air into contact with the clothes. This design is slower than conventional tumble dryers, but relatively energy-efficient if well-implemented. It works particularly well in cold and humid environments, where it dries clothes substantially faster than line-drying. In hot and dry weather, the performance delta over line-drying is negligible.

Given that this is a relatively simple and cheap technique to materialize, most consumer products showcase the added benefit of portability and/or modularity. Newer designs implement a fan heater at the bottom to pump hot air into the vertical drying rack chamber. Temperatures in excess of can be reached inside these &quot;hot air balloons,&quot; yet lint, static cling, and shrinkage are minimal. Upfront cost is significantly lower than tumble, condenser and heat pump designs.

If used in combination with washing machines featuring fast spin cycles (800+ rpm) or spin dryers, the cost-effectiveness of this technique has the potential to render tumble dryer-like designs obsolete in single-person and small family households. One disadvantage is that the moisture from the clothes is released into the immediate surroundings. Proper ventilation or a complementary dehumidifier is recommended for indoor use. It also cannot compete with the tumble dryer&#x27;s capacity to dry multiple loads of wet clothing in a single day.

===Solar clothes dryer===
The solar dryer is a box-shaped stationary construction which encloses a second compartment where the clothes are held. It uses the sun&#x27;s heat without direct sunlight reaching the clothes. Alternatively, a solar heating box may be used to heat air that is driven through a conventional tumbler dryer.

===Microwave dryers===
Japanese manufacturers have developed highly efficient clothes dryers that use microwave radiation to dry the clothes (though a vast majority of Japanese air dry their laundry). Most of the drying is done using microwaves to evaporate the water, but the final drying is done by convection heating, to avoid problems of arcing with metal pieces in the laundry. There are a number of advantages: shorter drying times (25% less), energy savings (17–25% less), and lower drying temperatures. Some analysts think that the arcing and fabric damage is a factor preventing microwave dryers from being developed for the US market.

===Ultrasonic dryers===
Ultrasonic dryers use high-frequency signals to drive piezoelectric actuators in order to mechanically shake the clothes, releasing water in the form of a mist which is then removed from the drum. They have the potential to significantly cut energy consumption while needing only one-third of the time needed by a conventional electric dryer for a given load. They also do not have the same issues related with lint in most other types of dryers.

===Hybrid dryers===
Some manufacturers, like LG Electronics and Whirlpool, have introduced hybrid dryers, that offer the user the option of using either a heat pump or a traditional electric heating element for drying the user&#x27;s clothes. Hybrid dryers can also use a heat pump and a heating element at the same time to dry clothes faster.

==Static electricity==
Clothes dryers can cause static cling through the triboelectric effect. This can be a minor nuisance and is often a symptom of over-drying textiles to below their equilibrium moisture level, particularly when using synthetic materials. Fabric conditioning products such as dryer sheets are marketed to dissipate this static charge, depositing surfactants onto the fabric load by mechanical abrasion during tumbling. Modern dryers often have improved temperature and humidity sensors and electronic controls which aim to stop the drying cycle once textiles are sufficiently dry, avoiding over-drying and the static charge and energy wastage this causes.

==Pest control use==
Drying at a minimum of heat for thirty minutes kills many parasites including house dust mites, bed bugs, and scabies mites and their eggs; a bit more than ten minutes kills ticks. Simply washing drowns dust mites, and exposure to direct sunlight for three hours kills their eggs.

==Lint build-up (tumble dryers)==
Moisture and lint are byproducts of the tumble drying process and are pulled from the drum by a fan motor and then pushed through the remaining exhaust conduit to the exterior termination fitting. Typical exhaust conduit comprises flex transition hose found immediately behind the dryer, the rigid galvanized pipe and elbow fittings found within the wall framing, and the vent duct hood found outside the house.

A clean, unobstructed dryer vent improves both the efficiency and safety of the dryer. As the dryer duct pipe becomes partially obstructed and filled with lint, drying time markedly increases and causes the dryer to waste energy. A blocked vent increases the internal temperature and may result in a fire. Clothes dryers are one of the more costly home appliances to operate.

Several factors can contribute to or accelerate rapid lint build-up. These include long or restrictive ducts, bird or rodent nests in the termination, crushed or kinked flex transition hose, terminations with screen-like features, and condensation within the duct due to un-insulated ducts traveling through cold spaces such as a crawl space or attic. If plastic flaps are at the outside end of the duct, one may be able to flex, bend, and temporarily remove the plastic flaps, clean the inside surface of the flaps, clean the last foot or so of the duct, and reattach the plastic flaps. The plastic flaps keep insects, birds, and snakes out of the dryer vent pipe. During cold weather, the warm wet air condenses on the plastic flaps, and minor trace amounts of lint sticks to the wet inside part of the plastic flaps at the outside of the building. 

Ventless dryers include multi-stage lint filtration systems and some even include automatic evaporator and condenser cleaning functions that can run even while the dryer is running. The evaporator and condenser are usually cleaned with running water. These systems are necessary, in order to prevent lint from building up inside the dryer and evaporator and condenser coils.

Aftermarket add-on lint and moisture traps can be attached to the dryer duct pipe, on machines originally manufactured as outside-venting, to facilitate installation where an outside vent is not available. Increased humidity at the location of installation is a drawback to this method.

==Safety==
Dryers expose flammable materials to heat. Underwriters Laboratories recommends cleaning the lint filter after every cycle for safety and energy efficiency, provision of adequate ventilation, and cleaning of the duct at regular intervals. UL also recommends that dryers not be used for glass fiber, rubber, foam or plastic items, or any item that has had a flammable substance spilled on it.

In the United States, an estimate from the US Fire Administration in a 2012 report estimated that from 2008 to 2010, fire departments responded to an estimated 2,900 clothes dryer fires in residential buildings each year across the nation. These fires resulted in an annual average loss of 5 deaths, 100 injuries, and $35 million in property loss. The Fire Administration attributes &quot;Failure to clean&quot; (34%) as the leading factor contributing to clothes dryer fires in residential buildings, and observed that new home construction trends place clothes dryers and washing machines in more hazardous locations away from outside walls, such as in bedrooms, second-floor hallways, bathrooms, and kitchens.

To address the problem of clothes dryer fires, a fire suppression system can be used with sensors to detect the change in temperature when a blaze starts in a dryer drum. These sensors then activate a water vapor mechanism to put out the fire.

==Environmental impact==
The environmental impact of clothes dryers is especially severe in the US and Canada, where over 80% of all homes have a clothes dryer. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, if all residential clothes dryers sold in the US were energy efficient, &quot;the utility cost savings would grow to more than $1.5 billion each year and more than 10 billion kilograms (22 billion pounds) of annual greenhouse gas emissions would be prevented”.

Clothes dryers are second only to refrigerators and freezers as the largest residential electrical energy consumers in America.

In the European Union, the EU energy labeling system is applied to dryers; dryers are classified with a label from A+++ (best) to G (worst) according to the amount of energy used per kilogram of clothes (kW⋅h/kg). Sensor dryers can automatically sense that clothes are dry and switch off. This means over-drying is not as frequent. Most of the European market sells sensor dryers now, and they are normally available in condenser and vented dryers.

==History==
A hand-cranked clothes dryer was created in 1800 by M. Pochon from France. Henry W. Altorfer invented and patented an electric clothes dryer in 1937. J. Ross Moore, an inventor from North Dakota, developed designs for automatic clothes dryers and published his design for an electrically operated dryer in 1938. Industrial designer Brooks Stevens developed an electric dryer with a glass window in the early 1940s.

<doc id="317905" wikidata="Q974039" url="?curid=317905" title="Centrifugal switch">
<text>A centrifugal switch is an electric switch that operates using the centrifugal force created from a rotating shaft, most commonly that of an electric motor or gasoline engine. The switch is designed to activate or de-activate as a function of the rotational speed of the shaft.

==History== 
A 1927 patent for a centrifugal switch (US Patent #1,630,394) was granted to Royal Lee on May 31, 1927. It was the basis for the formation of the Lee Engineering Company.

==Applications==

=== Electric motors ===
Perhaps the most common use of centrifugal switches is within single-phase, split-phase induction motors. Here, the switch is used to disconnect the starting winding of the motor once the motor approaches its normal operating speed. In this case, the centrifugal switch consists of weights mounted to the shaft of the motor and held near the shaft by spring force. At rest, levers attached to the weights press a low-friction, non-conductive plate against a set of electrical contacts mounted to the motor housing, closing the contacts and connecting the starting winding to the power source. When the motor approaches its normal operating speed, centrifugal force overcomes the spring force and the weights swing out, raising the plate away from the electrical contacts. This allows the contacts to open and disconnects the starting winding from the power source; the motor then continues operating solely using its &quot;running winding&quot;. Motors using such a centrifugal switch make a distinct clicking noise when starting and stopping as the centrifugal switch opens and closes.

A variation of the centrifugal switch used a changeover contact to ensure that the auxiliary windings remain in the circuit through a running capacitor. These motors are called two-value or capacitor start capacitor run motors.

Centrifugal switches are found in many clothes dryers, supplying power to the motor in parallel with the start switch. As long as the motor continues turning, the centrifugal switch supplies power, but if something jams in the dryer and slows it down too much, the switch will cut power.

Centrifugal switches were also used in early electric fans, particularly those made in the 1900s and early 1910s. 

In aircraft, a centrifugal switch is used to control the starting and ignition circuits, the governed speed indication circuit and the overspeed protection circuit of the auxiliary power unit. This switch is mounted inside a rotating body. This can be set to activate or deactivate a circuit as the rpm of device increases or decreases.

Centrifugal switches are designed to minimize frictional contact between the rotating speed sensor and the non-rotating switch body. In most cases, this is done by having contact at low speed, which is pulled away at operating speed, so there is friction only during brief periods of start-up and slow-down. However, overspeed switches work the other way, making contact at high speed, but avoiding contact at normal operating speed.

<text>D-1 or 4:2:2 Component Digital is an SMPTE digital recording video standard, introduced in 1986 through efforts by SMPTE engineering committees. It started as a Sony and Bosch – BTS product and was the first major professional digital video format. SMPTE standardized the format within ITU-R 601 (orig. CCIR-601), also known as Rec. 601, which was derived from SMPTE 125M and EBU 3246-E standards.

== Format ==
D-1 or 4:2:2 D-1 (1986) was a major feat in real time, broadcast quality digital video recording. It stores uncompressed digitized component video, encoded at Y&#x27;CbCr 4:2:2 using the CCIR 601 raster format with 8 bits, along with PCM audio tracks as well as timecode on a 3/4 inch (19 mm) videocassette tape (though not to be confused with the ubiquitous 3/4-inch U-Matic/U-Matic SP cassette). 

The uncompressed component video used enormous bandwidth for its time: 167 Mbit/sec (bit rate). One of the first D-1 VTRs, the Sony DVR-1000, required a separate, large video processor. Its successor, the DVR-2000, integrated it into the same chassis as the VTR. The maximum record time on a D-1 tape is 94 minutes. Medium tapes could record up to 34 minutes, and small tapes up to 6 minutes.

The format uses helical scan, with an M wrap pattern in which the tape is wrapped around the head drum around the left and right side. The helical scan head drum rotates at 10,800 RPM for NTSC video, or at 9000 RPM for PAL. It is 75 mm in diameter and the helical tracks, read by video heads mounted on the head drum, are 40 microns wide. Writing speed at the heads is 33.63 m/s, linear tape speeds are 286.588 mm/s for NTSC, 286.875 mm/s for PAL.

Because of the uncompromising picture quality, component processing and uncompressed recording, D-1 was most popular in high-end graphic and animation production – where multiple layering had previously been done in short run times via hard drives (Quantel Harry, Henry, Harriet, Hal or Abekas DDR) or via multiple analog machines running at once. Hard drives in the 1980s that stored broadcast-quality video would typically only hold 30 seconds to a few minutes of space, yet the systems that made them work could cost $500,000. By contrast, the D-1 machine allowed 94 minutes of recording on a $200 cassette.

D-1 resolution is 720 (horizontal) × 486 (vertical) for NTSC systems and 720 × 576 for PAL systems; these resolutions come from Rec. 601. 

A small variation removing the top 6 lines to save space was later introduced and made popular in the 1/4-inch DV/DVCAM/DVCPRO formats and for digital broadcasting, which have 720 x 480 pixels for NTSC; and is also used in DVD-Video and standard-definition television.

The D1 units are switchable between NTSC and PAL. Luma is sampled at 13.5 MHz and Chroma at 6.75 MHz with an overall data rate of 27 MHz. Sampling at 13.5 MHz was used as it is a common multiple of NTSC/PAL line rate (6 x 2.5 MHz). The first input/output interface was a 25 pin parallel cable (SMPTE 125M) and later updated to serial digital interface on coaxial cable (SDI, SMPTE 259M, 75Ω coax, 270 MHz). Ancillary data can be put in H/V blanking intervals. Color space for Y’ B’-Y’ R’-Y’ is also defined in ITU Rec. 601 or Rec. 709 color space.

Panasonic&#x27;s D-5 format has similar specifications, but sampled at 10-bits as opposed to D-1&#x27;s 8-bits. It had the advantage of development time as it was released much later than Sony&#x27;s D-1 and one year after Sony&#x27;s Digital Betacam format was unveiled.

The D-2 format system from Sony and Ampex soon followed two years later, using composite video in order to lower the bandwidth needed. This reduced D-2&#x27;s price tag to half that of D-1. Since D-2 was composite digital as opposed to component, it could easily be dropped into the space and infrastructure of composite analog machines presently used at the time (2-inch Quadruplex, 1-inch Type C and 3/4-inch U-Matic). Since less information was recorded on D-2 than on D-1, tape speed could be reduced and hold a maximum of 208 minutes compared to D-1&#x27;s 94 minutes. However, D-2 was still a compromise, being composite video.

As broadcasters would later convert from analog to digital wiring, component digital infrastructure became feasible. Sony&#x27;s popular component Digital Betacam supported this transition by keeping the colors separated in component digital space (D1/D5) rather than combined in composite space (D2/D3). Digital Betacam could play previous analog Betacam/Betacam SP tapes which by now had built a library archive for broadcasters using its 1/2-inch tape format (as opposed to the bulkier 19mm D1/D2 cassettes). 1/2-inch Digital Betacam thus became the de facto standard-definition broadcast editing, delivery and archive standard.

Even as HD broadcasting and delivery became more commonplace in the U.S. after 2008–2010, networks would often require standard definition copies on Digital Betacam. Television shows such as CBS&#x27; &quot;The Rachael Ray Show&quot; were still recorded and archived on Digital Betacam as late as 2012.

== Use ==
D-1 was notoriously expensive and the equipment required very large infrastructure changes in facilities which upgraded to this digital recording format, because the machines being uncompromising in quality reverted to component processing (where the luminance or black-and-white information of the picture) and its primary colors red, green and blue (RGB) were kept separate in a sampling algorithm known as 4:2:2, which is why many machines have a badge of &quot;4:2:2&quot; instead of &quot;D-1.&quot;

Early D-1 operations were plagued with difficulties, though the format quickly stabilized and is still renowned for its superb standard definition image quality.

D-1 was the very first real-time digital broadcast-quality tape format. The original Sony DVR-1000 unveiled in 1986 had a U.S. MSRP (manufacturer suggested retail price) of $160,000. A few years later, Sony&#x27;s engineers were able to drastically reduce the size of the machine by reducing the electronic processing to fit into the main cassette drive chassis, christened the DVR-2000, lowering the U.S. cost to $120,000.

An external single-rack unit would enable the machine to record an additional key (matte) channel (4:2:2:4) or double the horizontal resolution (8:4:4) by combining two VTRs running simultaneously.

Later &quot;SP&quot; and &quot;OS&quot; models ran Off-SPeed, making them technically friendly for 24-frame telecine film transfers to D1 tape – and allowing a single tape to provide both NTSC (525 vertical lines) and PAL (625 lines) masters at one time.

==Relation to other tapes==
While early color television experiments were kept in the component domain of RGB, most color television broadcasting and post production was compromised in the 1960s and 1970s to simplify infrastructure and transmission by combining the color and luminance (composite). However, once the color and luminance information was combined, it could never truly be uncombined as cleanly as originated.

Component video was rarely processed through a video facility as RGB, as it is in computer displays. There was a historical legacy need to maintain black-and-white signals. Further, as the human eye is more sensitive to black-and-white picture information than color, engineers calculated that with the size of the largest home television screen, the color video lines did not need to be sampled for every converted digital pixel.

Sony&#x27;s 1982 news-gathering 1/2-inch video format Betacam, the first camcorder combination came up with a compromise, known as YUV. The &quot;Y&quot; was luminance, or the detail of the video picture, in black-and-white. It contained the sync &#x27;frame&#x27; needed to make a stable picture. If one connects only the &quot;Y&quot; cable, one can see a black-and-white image, but not if only connecting the other two color information channels.

The &quot;UV&quot; was a math algorithm of R-Y (red minus luminance) and B-Y (blue minus luminance). The green information was derived by the difference (thus YUV is referred to as color difference processing). For example, if there are five black-and-white panda teddy bears in a box (Y); plus eight red apples (R-Y) and two blueberries (B-Y); and the total number of items has to equal 20, one can easily calculate how many remaining green apples there are, as 20 minus 15 would leave a difference of five.

When engineers sought to process and record in real time the huge amount of digital data needed to make the first digital video tape format, keeping the Y, R-Y, B-Y or YUV algorithm was key to simplifying and reducing the initial picture information sampled, saving valuable space.

4:2:2 is Y, R-Y and B-Y; not RGB; 4:2:2 is often erroneously quoted as 4 meaning red, and the remaining 2s standing for green and blue. If this were true, it would produce an uneven recording of green and blue data compared to red.

In a given small sample of the video picture – for instance the first four pixels going across horizontally in the top-left corner of the screen, the first &quot;4&quot; means that the more important luminance/black-and-white picture detail was sampled in every pixel in that 4-sample.

The next two 2s mean that R-Y and B-Y were sampled at every other pixel, skipping the one in-between. The eye should not be able to see the two in-between pixels not having the actual color information that the originating camera recorded – previous color pixel is simply replicated. Thus with 4:2:2, all color, red, green and blue, is sampled at half the rate of the black-and-white (luminance) picture detail. You could say that 50% of the color is actually recorded – because for the TV screen, it was good enough for the human eye.

The popular 1995/96 1/4-inch DV/DVCAM/DVCPRO format had a component digital YUV sampling of 4:1:1, meaning only 1 out of 4 pixels or 25% of the color is actually recorded, which is why the color looks &quot;muddy&quot; and not as vibrant when compared to any 4:2:2 recording. This further made perfect green screen mattes impossible on the format. The DV format further compressed the digital data at 5:1, meaning compromising the picture information by 80% to get 25 million bits per second onto a small tape moving at a slow speed. Compare the DV quality to 1986&#x27;s D1, with 4:2:2, no compression, and 173~226 million bits per second of data preserved.

Modern high definition video recorders like Sony&#x27;s HDCAM-SR format, SR stands for superior resolution, have the ability to switch between 4:2:2 and full RGB recording for giant-screen motion picture work, thus RGB is sampled at every pixel and branded 4:4:4.

<doc id="317918" wikidata="Q1887587" url="?curid=317918" title="DIP switch">
<text>A DIP switch is a manual electric switch that is packaged with others in a group in a standard dual in-line package (DIP). The term may refer to each individual switch, or to the unit as a whole. This type of switch is designed to be used on a printed circuit board along with other electronic components and is commonly used to customize the behavior of an electronic device for specific situations.

DIP switches are an alternative to jumper blocks. Their main advantages are that they are quicker to change and there are no parts to lose.

==History==
US patent 3621157, filed in 1970 by Pierre Schwab, is the earliest known DIP switch patent, which discloses a rotary style DIP switch.

US patent 4012608, filed in 1975 by Joseph Lockard, is a DIP switch with sliding levers, the modern DIP switch.

==Types==
The slide, rocker, and piano types, which are very common, are arrays of simple single pole, single throw (SPST) contacts, each of which can be either on or off. This allows each switch to select a one-bit binary value. The values of all switches in the package can also be interpreted as one number. For example, seven switches offer 128 (27) combinations, allowing them to select a standard ASCII character. Eight switches offer 256 (28) combinations, which is equivalent to one byte.

A tri-state type DIP switch can be in one of three positions (+, 0, −) which allows more codes than a binary DIP switch. For example, 8 pole tri-state DIP switches offer 6,561 (38) combinations/codes compared to 8 pole binary switches&#x27; 256 (28) combinations/codes. This makes them especially suitable for encoding devices such as a remote controller.

Rotary DIP switches contain multiple electrical contacts, one of which is selected by rotating the switch to align it with a number printed on the package. Some have a knob that can be turned by fingers, or a small slot that requires a screwdriver to change them. Typically, rotary types are available in two different types of output, 1) a binary encoded output, where 10 (BCD) or 16 (hex) choices are encoded into a 4-bit binary output, or 5 to 8 choices are encoded into a 3-bit binary output. 2) a rotary version of a multipole slide switch where one signal has a choice between multiple connections, such as SPDT, SP3T, SP4T.

The DIP switch package also has socket pins or mounting leads to provide an electrical path from the switch contacts to the circuit board. Although circuits can use the electrical contacts directly, it is more common to convert them into high and low signals. In this case, the circuit board also needs interface circuitry for the DIP switch, consisting of a series of pull-up or pull-down resistors, a buffer, decode logic, and other components. Typically, the device&#x27;s firmware reads the DIP switches when the device is powered on.

Single in-line SIP switches are also available, which only have one row of pins instead of the two rows of pins in DIP packages. This saves on pins and space. One of the pins is a common.

With the popularization of surface-mount technology, these switches are now commonly available in non-DIP surface-mount package types. They are, however, still referred to as &quot;DIP switches&quot;, as the term has become associated with the style of switch.

==Contacts==
There are many different kinds of DIP switches. Some of the most common are the slide, rocker, piano (side), and rotary types.
Slide / rocker / piano DIP switches are commonly available in 1 to 12 contacts (positions) SPST, though some are available as special order up to 30 contacts (positions).

==Applications==
DIP switches were used extensively in ISA architecture of PC expansion cards to select IRQs and memory addresses. Before the advent of cheaper, battery-backed RAM, DIP switches were also often used on arcade games in the 1980s and early 1990s to enter game settings such as difficulty or the number of credits per coin. DIP switches were very commonly used to set security codes on garage door openers as well as on some early cordless phones. This design, which used up to 12 switches in a group, was used to avoid RF interference from other nearby door opener remotes or other devices. Current garage door openers use rolling code systems for better security.

These types of switches were used on early video cards for early computers to facilitate compatibility with other video standards. For example, CGA cards allowed for MDA compatibility.

After the late 1990s, DIP switches became less common in consumer electronics. Reasons include the trend toward smaller products, the demand for easier configuration through software menus or plug and play, and the falling price of non-volatile memory. However, DIP switches are still widely used in industrial equipment because they are inexpensive and easy to incorporate into circuit designs, and because they allow settings to be checked at a glance without powering the system on.

DIP switches are still used in some remote controls to prevent interference; for example, to control a ceiling fan (and its light fixture) that was retrofitted to a single-circuit junction box. The DIP switches set a different radio frequency or address for each transmitter/receiver pair, so that multiple units can be installed without unintentionally controlling each other.

<text>Hydromorphone, also known as dihydromorphinone, and sold under the brand name Dilaudid among others, is a morphinan opioid used to treat moderate to severe pain. Typically, long-term use is only recommended for pain due to cancer. It may be used by mouth or by injection into a vein, muscle, or under the skin. Effects generally begin within half an hour and last for up to five hours. A 2016 Cochrane review (updated in 2021) found little difference in benefit between hydromorphone and other opioids for cancer pain.
Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, itchiness, and constipation. Serious side effects may include abuse, low blood pressure, seizures, respiratory depression, and serotonin syndrome. Rapidly decreasing the dose may result in opioid withdrawal. Generally, use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Hydromorphone is believed to work by activating opioid receptors, mainly in the brain and spinal cord. Hydromorphone 2 mg IV is equivalent to approximately 10 mg morphine IV.
Hydromorphone was patented in 1923. Hydromorphone is made from morphine. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 233rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.
== Side effects ==

Adverse effects of hydromorphone are similar to those of other potent opioid analgesics such as morphine and heroin. The major hazards of hydromorphone include dose-related respiratory depression, urinary retention, bronchospasm, and sometimes, circulatory depression. More common side effects include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, itching, constipation, nausea, vomiting, headache, perspiration, and hallucinations. These symptoms are common in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.

Simultaneous use of hydromorphone with other opioids, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, sedatives, and general anesthetics may cause a significant increase in respiratory depression, progressing to coma or death. Taking benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) in conjunction with hydromorphone may increase side effects such as dizziness and difficulty concentrating. If simultaneous use of these drugs is required, dose adjustment may be made.

A particular problem that may occur with hydromorphone is accidental administration in place of morphine due to a mix-up between the similar names, either at the time the prescription is written or when the drug is dispensed. This has led to several deaths and calls for hydromorphone to be distributed in distinctly different packaging from morphine to avoid confusion.

Massive overdoses are rarely observed in opioid-tolerant individuals, but when they occur, they may lead to circulatory system collapse. Symptoms of overdose include respiratory depression, drowsiness leading to coma and sometimes to death, drooping of skeletal muscles, low heart rate, and decreasing blood pressure. At the hospital, individuals with hydromorphone overdose are provided supportive care, such as assisted ventilation to provide oxygen and gut decontamination using activated charcoal through a nasogastric tube. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, also may be administered concurrently with oxygen supplementation. Naloxone works by reversing the effects of hydromorphone, and only is administered in the presence of significant respiratory depression and circulatory depression.

Sugar cravings associated with hydromorphone use are the result of a glucose crash after transient hyperglycemia following injection, or a less profound lowering of blood sugar over a period of hours, in common with morphine, heroin, codeine, and other opioids.

=== Hormone imbalance ===
As with other opioids, hydromorphone (particularly during heavy chronic use) often causes temporary hypogonadism or hormone imbalance.

=== Neurotoxicity ===

In the setting of prolonged use, high dosage, and/or kidney dysfunction, hydromorphone has been associated with neuroexcitatory symptoms such as tremor, myoclonus, agitation, and cognitive dysfunction. This toxicity is less than that associated with other classes of opioids such as the pethidine class of synthetics in particular.

=== Withdrawal ===

Users of hydromorphone may experience painful symptoms if the drug is suspended. Some people cannot tolerate the symptoms, which results in continuous drug use. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal are not easy to decipher, as there are differences between drug-seeking behaviors and true withdrawal effects. Symptoms associated with hydromorphone withdrawal include:
* Abdominal pain
* Anxiety
* Panic attacks
* Depression
* Piloerection (goose bumps)
* Inability to enjoy daily activities
* Muscle and joint pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Runny nose and excessive secretion of tears
* Sweating

In the clinical setting, excessive secretion of tears, yawning, and dilation of pupils are helpful presentations in diagnosing opioid withdrawal. Hydromorphone is a rapid-acting painkiller; however, some formulations may last up to several hours. Patients who stop taking this drug abruptly may experience withdrawal symptoms, which may start within hours of taking the last dose of hydromorphone, and last up to several weeks. Withdrawal symptoms in people who stopped taking the opioid may be managed by using opioids or non-opioid adjuncts. Methadone is an opioid commonly used for this kind of therapy. However, the selection of therapy should be tailored to each specific person. Methadone also is used for detoxification in people who have opiate addiction, such as heroin or drugs similar to morphine. It may be given orally or intramuscularly. There is controversy regarding whether any opioid (such as methadone) should be included in the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, since these agents also may cause relapse when therapy is suspended. Clonidine is a non-opioid adjunct which may be used in situations where opioid use is not desired, such as in patients with high blood pressure.

== Interactions ==
CNS depressants may enhance the depressant effects of hydromorphone, such as other opioids, anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, chloral hydrate, dimenhydrinate, and glutethimide. The depressant effect of hydromorphone also may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors), first-generation antihistamines (e.g., brompheniramine, promethazine, diphenhydramine, chlorphenamine), beta blockers, and alcohol. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.

== Pharmacology ==


Hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic μ-opioid agonist. As a hydrogenated ketone of morphine, it shares the pharmacologic properties typical of opioid analgesics. Hydromorphone and related opioids produce their major effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. These include analgesia, drowsiness, mental clouding, changes in mood, euphoria or dysphoria, respiratory depression, cough suppression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased biliary pressure, and increased pinpoint constriction of the pupils.

=== Formulations ===

Hydromorphone is available in parenteral, rectal, subcutaneous, and oral formulations, and also can be administered via epidural or intrathecal injection. Hydromorphone also has been administered via nebulization to treat shortness of breath, but it is not used as a route for pain control due to low bioavailability. Transdermal delivery systems are also under consideration to induce local skin analgesia.

Concentrated aqueous solutions of hydromorphone hydrochloride have a visibly different refractive index from pure water, isotonic 9‰ (0·9 per cent) saline and the like, especially when stored in clear ampoules and phials may acquire a slight clear amber discolouration upon exposure to light; this reportedly has no effect on the potency of the solution, but 14-dihydromorphinones such as hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and relatives come with instructions to protect from light. Ampoules of solution which have developed a precipitate should be discarded.

Battery-powered intrathecal drug delivery systems are implanted for chronic pain when other options are ruled out, such as surgery and traditional pharmacotherapy, provided that the patient is considered a suitable fit in terms of any contraindications, both physiological and psychological.

An extended-release (once-daily) version of hydromorphone is available in the United States. Previously, an extended-release version of hydromorphone, Palladone, was available before being voluntarily withdrawn from the market after a July 2005 FDA advisory warned of a high overdose potential when taken with alcohol. As of March 2010, it is still available in the United Kingdom under the brand name Palladone SR, Nepal under the brand name Opidol, and in most other European countries, In Canada, prescription continuous release hydromorphone is available as both brand name (Hydromorph Contin) and generic formulations (Apo-Hydromorphone CR).

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

The chemical modification of the morphine molecule to hydromorphone results in higher lipid solubility and greater ability to cross the blood–brain barrier to produce more rapid and complete central nervous system penetration. On a per milligram basis, hydromorphone is considered to be five times as potent as morphine; although the conversion ratio may vary from 4–8 times, five times is in typical clinical usage.

Patients with renal abnormalities must exercise caution when dosing hydromorphone. In those with renal impairment, the half-life of hydromorphone may increase to as much as 40 hours. The typical half-life of intravenous hydromorphone is 2.3 hours. Peak plasma levels usually occur between 30 and 60 minutes after oral dosing.

The onset of action for hydromorphone administered intravenously is less than 5 minutes and within 30 minutes of oral administration (immediate release).

=== Metabolism ===

While other opioids in its class, such as codeine or oxycodone, are metabolized via CYP450 enzymes, hydromorphone is not. Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized in the liver to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which has no analgesic effects. As similarly seen with the morphine metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide, a build-up in levels of hydromorphone-3-glucuronide may produce excitatory neurotoxic effects such as restlessness, myoclonus and hyperalgesia. Patients with compromised kidney function and older patients are at higher risk for metabolite accumulation.

== Chemistry ==
With a formula of C17H19NO3 and a molecular weight of 285.343, both identical to morphine, hydromorphone can be considered a structural isomer of morphine and is a hydrogenated ketone thereof.

Hydromorphone is made from morphine either by direct re-arrangement (made by reflux heating of alcoholic or acidic aqueous solution of morphine in the presence of platinum or palladium catalyst) or reduction to dihydromorphine (usually via catalytic hydrogenation), followed by oxidation with benzophenone in presence of potassium tert butoxide or aluminium tert butoxide (Oppenauer oxidation). The 6 ketone group may be replaced with a methylene group via the Wittig reaction to produce 6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine, which is 80× stronger than morphine.

Hydromorphone is more soluble in water than morphine; therefore, hydromorphone solutions may be produced to deliver the drug in a smaller volume of water. The hydrochloride salt is soluble in three parts of water, whereas a gram of morphine hydrochloride dissolves in 16 ml of water; for all common purposes, the pure powder for hospital use can be used to produce solutions of virtually arbitrary concentration. When the powder appeared on the street, this very small volume of powder needed for a dose means that overdoses are likely for those who mistake it for heroin or other powdered narcotics, especially those that have been diluted prior to consumption.

=== Bacteria ===

Some bacteria have been shown to be able to turn morphine into closely related drugs, including hydromorphone and dihydromorphine among others. The bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot; serotype M10 produces a naturally-occurring NADH-dependent morphinone reductase that can work on unsaturated 7,8 bonds, with result that, when these bacteria are living in an aqueous solution containing morphine, significant amounts of hydromorphone form, as it is an intermediary metabolite in this process; the same goes for codeine being turned into hydrocodone.

== History ==

Hydromorphone was patented in 1923. It was introduced to the mass market in 1926 under the brand name &quot;Dilaudid&quot;, indicating its derivation and degree of similarity to morphine (by way of laudanum).

== Society and culture ==

=== Names ===

Hydromorphone is known in various countries around the world by the brand names Hydal, Dimorphone, Exalgo, Sophidone LP, Dilaudid, Hydrostat, Hydromorfan, Hydromorphan, Hymorphan, Laudicon, Opidol, Palladone, Hydromorph Contin, and others. An extended-release version of hydromorphone, called Palladone, was available for a short time in the United States before being voluntarily withdrawn from the market after a July 2005 FDA advisory warned of a high overdose potential when taken with alcohol. As of March 2010, it is still available in Nepal under the brand name Opidol, in the United Kingdom under the brand name Palladone SR, and in most other European countries.

There has also been a once-daily prolonged release version of hydromorphone available in Australia under the brand name Jurnista as of May 2009.

In the United States, the main drug control agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, reports an increase in annual aggregate production quotas of hydromorphone from in 1998 to in 2006, and an increase in prescriptions in this time of 289%, from about 470,000 to 1,830,000. The 2013 production quota was .

Like all opioids used for analgesia, hydromorphone is potentially habit-forming and is listed in Schedule II of the United States Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as well as in similar levels under the drugs laws of practically all other countries and it is listed in the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs. The DEA ACSCN for hydromorphone is 9150.

Hydromorphone is listed under the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz as a Betäubungsmittel in the most restricted schedule for medicinal drugs; it is controlled similarly in Austria (Suchtgift) under the SMG and the Swiss BetmG. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (United Kingdom) and comparable French, Canadian, Australian, Italian, Czech, Croatian, Slovenian, Swedish, Polish, Spanish, Greek, Russian, and other laws similarly control it, as do regulations in virtually all other countries.

=== Use in executions ===

In 2009, Ohio approved the use of an intramuscular injection of 500 mg of hydromorphone and a supratherapeutic dose of midazolam as a backup means of carrying out executions by lethal injection when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.

Hydromorphone and midazolam was injected intravenously to execute double-murderer Joseph Wood in Arizona on 24 July 2014. Wood was heavily sedated (&quot;surgical anesthesia&quot;) within four minutes from start, but took almost two hours to transition to stage 4 (cessation of respiration) and death.

<text>Eugen Jochum (; 1 November 1902 – 26 March 1987) was a German conductor, best known for his interpretations of the music of Anton Bruckner, Carl Orff, and Johannes Brahms, among others.

==Biography==
Jochum was born to a Roman Catholic family in Babenhausen, near Augsburg, Germany; his father was an organist and conductor. Jochum studied the piano and organ in Augsburg, enrolling in its Academy of Music from 1914 to 1922. He then studied at the Munich Conservatory, with his composition teacher being Hermann von Waltershausen; it was there that he changed his focus to conducting, his teacher being Siegmund von Hausegger, who conducted the first performance of the original version of the Ninth Symphony of Anton Bruckner and made the first recording of it.

Jochum&#x27;s first post was as a rehearsal pianist at Mönchen-Gladbach, and then in Kiel. He made his conducting debut with the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra in 1926 in a program which included Bruckner&#x27;s Seventh Symphony. In the same year he was appointed conductor at the Kiel Opera House, where he conducted seventeen operas in his first season, including &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;, &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and &quot;Turandot.&quot;

After Kiel he went to Mannheim, where Wilhelm Furtwängler praised his conducting. He turned down an offer to conduct twelve concerts with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra, believing that his repertory and experience were not yet equal to it. (He did not appear in America until 1958.) His next appointment was as music director in Duisburg, from 1930 to 1932. In 1932 he became chief of the Berlin Radio Orchestra, also conducting 16 concerts a season with the Berlin Philharmonic, and at the Deutsche Oper.

In 1934 Jochum succeeded Karl Böhm as musical director of the Hamburg State Opera and the Hamburg Philharmonic. Throughout the Nazi era, Hamburg remained, as Jochum put it, &quot;reasonably liberal&quot;, and Jochum was even able to keep his post despite not joining the party. He performed music by composers such as Hindemith and Bartók elsewhere banned by the Nazis. In 1944, Joseph Goebbels included Jochum in the Gottbegnadeten list.

In the postwar denazification initiatives, however, British and American authorities had a &quot;high-level disagreement&quot; over Jochum that was &quot;an exception&quot; to the usual pattern of British authorities following the American lead: after &quot;initially clearing&quot; Jochum and selecting him to conduct the Munich Philharmonic in May 1945, the American authorities temporarily blacklisted him on grounds that he &quot;had done exceptionally well&quot; during the war and that his brothers had been &quot;fanatical&quot; Nazis; but British authorities &quot;found no fault&quot; with Jochum, arguing that he had never been a member of the Nazi party, SS or Sturmabteilung, had remained a &quot;convinced Roman Catholic,&quot; and had &quot;not compromised his artistic integrity.&quot; It took until 1948 before the American authorities determined that they could find no evidence of his joining any Nazi organizations.

Jochum continued to serve at Hamburg until 1949, then left when the newly reconstituted Bayerischer Rundfunk appointed him the founding music director of its new orchestra, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. To build the orchestra, Jochum &quot;recruited highly qualified musicians,&quot; including the Koeckert Quartet as the &quot;nucleus of the strings&quot;. Jochum remained music director of the orchestra until 1961; with it, he made numerous recordings, mostly for Deutsche Grammophon.

Jochum was also a regular guest conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam, and served as the orchestra&#x27;s &#x27;first conductor&#x27; (&#x27;) from 1941 to 1943, during the chief conductorship of Willem Mengelberg. From 1961 to 1963, Jochum was joint chief conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra alongside Bernard Haitink. He conducted frequently in London, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra. In 1975, the LSO appointed him conductor laureate, a position he held until 1978. Jochum served as principal conductor of the Bamberg Symphony from 1969 to 1973. He later worked regularly with the Staatskapelle Dresden, with which he recorded the complete symphonies of Bruckner and &quot;London&quot; symphonies of Joseph Haydn (which latter he also recorded with the London Philharmonic). He appeared regularly at the Salzburg Festival. He also, in 1953–54 and 1971, conducted at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus; he made his debut conducting &quot;Tristan und Isolde.&quot;

He led the world premieres of various works, including the Concerto for Strings by Boris Blacher, the &quot;Concerte per il principe Eugenio&quot; by Alberto Bruno Tedeschi, the &quot;Suite Française&quot; by Werner Egk, the &quot;Tanz-Rondo&quot; by Gottfried von Einem, and the Symphony No. 6 by Karl Amadeus Hartmann.

He was a regular recording artist, from his first records in 1932. In the stereo LP era, he recorded mainly for Deutsche Grammophon. His DG cycle of the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, split between the Berlin Philharmonic and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, has remained in the record catalogs ever since its first issue in the 1960s. This cycle and a later Jochum Bruckner cycle, with the Staatskapelle Dresden for EMI, have been widely and frequently acclaimed and have caused his name to be especially associated with this composer. In addition, he was president of the International Bruckner Society from 1950, and wrote extensively about Bruckner interpretation. Still, according to his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, he said in a 1983 interview, &quot;Today, everyone thinks of me as a specialist in Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies. But I began with the music of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. And it is to their music that I still feel closest.&quot; His recordings of Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor and St. John Passion are frequently counted among the finest of these works. His three complete recordings of the Beethoven symphonies have also been strongly praised: they were made with the Berlin Philharmonic and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in the 1950s for Deutsche Grammophon, with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in the late 1960s for Philips, and with the London Symphony Orchestra in the 1970s for EMI. Jochum also made two complete recordings of the symphonies of Johannes Brahms, one with the Berlin Philharmonic in the mid-1950s, the other with the London Philharmonic in 1977. On the strengths of these sets, the conductor Kenneth Woods called him &quot;the greatest Brahms conductor who ever lived.&quot; (Others would nominate Weingartner or Toscanini.) He also recorded the Brahms piano concertos with Emil Gilels, a recording that is often listed among the finest made of these works. His recordings of Mozart, Haydn, Schumann, Wagner and Carl Orff have also been highly praised. His 1967 recording of &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; is considered by Bill Alford to be an authoritative interpretation, as Orff himself was present during the recording and endorsed the finished product.

Regarding his podium technique, Kenneth Woods blogs, &quot;Look at his hands -- very small and focused motions but so powerful.&quot; Woods also states that &quot;his sense of rubato, while still incredibly daring, is perhaps more un-erring than even that of Wilhelm Furtwängler.&quot;

Jochum&#x27;s older brother Otto Jochum (1898–1969) was a composer and choral conductor; his younger brother Georg Ludwig Jochum (1909–1970) was, like Jochum, an orchestral conductor. His daughter Veronica Jochum is a pianist on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.

Jochum died in Munich in 1987, at the age of 84. His wife Maria predeceased him, in 1985.

<doc id="317924" wikidata="Q503253" url="?curid=317924" title="István Kertész (conductor)">
<text>István Kertész (28 August 192916 April 1973) was a Hungarian orchestral and operatic conductor who throughout his brief career led many of the world&#x27;s great orchestras, including the Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Francisco and Minnesota Orchestras in the United States, as well as the London Symphony, Vienna Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Israel Philharmonic, and L&#x27;Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. 

Kertész&#x27;s orchestral repertoire numbered over 450 works from all periods, and was matched by a repertoire of some sixty operas ranging from Mozart, Verdi, Puccini and Wagner to the more contemporary Prokofiev, Bartók, Britten, Kodály, Poulenc and Janáček. Kertész was part of a musical tradition that produced fellow Hungarian conductors Fritz Reiner, Antal Doráti, János Ferencsik, Eugene Ormandy, George Szell, János Fürst, Peter Erős, Ferenc Fricsay, and Georg Solti.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Kertész was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1929, the first child of Margit Muresian and Miklós Kertész. His sister, Vera, was born four years later. Miklós Kertész, born in Szécsény, Hungary into a large Jewish family, was the director of a leather-works and died of appendicitis in 1938. Margit Muresian Kertész went to work to support her family. At an early age Kertész showed a great affinity for music, and began violin lessons. &quot;When I was six and started music,&quot; he told a &quot;High Fidelity&quot; interviewer, &quot;it was 1935 and cruel things were going on in Europe ... I found my &#x27;exile&#x27; in music, practicing the piano, the fiddle, and writing little compositions.&quot;

===World War II and the Holocaust===
With the failure of Hungary&#x27;s efforts to negotiate an armistice with the western Allies, German forces occupied Hungary on 19 March 1944. Aware of what was happening to Jews throughout Europe, the family went into hiding. Most of Kertész&#x27;s extended family were deported to Auschwitz in July 1944 and did not survive the Holocaust.

At the insistence of his mother, and despite the wartime interruptions of air raids, deportations, starvation and invasions by both Germans and later, the Russians, István Kertész continued his musical studies. By the time he was twelve, Kertész began to study the piano and composition in addition to the violin. The young Kertész, along with his sister, took advantage of Budapest&#x27;s rich cultural life and attended symphonic or operatic performances almost every evening. It was at this time that Kertész decided to become a conductor. After the war, he resumed his formal studies and attended the Kölcsey-Gymnasium where, in 1947, he graduated with honors.

That same year, István Kertész enrolled as a scholarship student at the Royal Academy of Music, now the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied violin, piano and composition with Zoltán Kodály, Leó Weiner and Rezső Kókai. Developing his keen interest in conducting, Kertész became a student of János Ferencsik and László Somogyi. At the conservatory, Kertész also met his wife, the lyric soprano Edith Gancs, whom he married in 1951. She later changed her name to Edith Kertész-Gabry. The pair were part of a cohort of musicians. Musically, Kertész was most influenced by László Somogyi, Bruno Walter and Otto Klemperer, then the director of the Budapest Opera.

==Career==
On 17 December 1948, István Kertész made his debut as a conductor with an all-Mozart programme.

===Budapest===
In 1953 Kertész was chosen as Chief Conductor of the Philharmonic Orchestra at Győr, a post that he held for two years. During this period he had the opportunity to develop a broad symphonic repertoire, leading the Budapest Opera Orchestra from 1955 to 1957, and working as an Assistant Professor of Conducting at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. After the upheaval of the Hungarian Revolution, and with a young family in tow, Kertész left Hungary. Offered a fellowship to the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Kertész studied with Fernando Previtali while his wife, Edith Kertész-Gabry sang at the Bremen Opera. Kertész graduated with distinction, and was given the highest award of the Accademia, the &quot;Premio d&#x27;Atri.&quot; Moreover, Previtali chose Kertész for his &quot;Corso di Perfezionamento&quot; for two successive seasons, during which Kertész conducted the Santa Cecilia Orchestra forty times.

After completing his studies in Rome, Kertész was engaged as a guest conductor of the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra and the Hamburg State Opera. Guest conducting there, as well as in Wiesbaden and Hanover, he conducted &quot;Fidelio&quot; and &quot;La bohème&quot;.

===Augsburg Opera===
In March 1960, Kertész was invited to become general music director of the Augsburg Opera—a post especially created for him. There he conducted performances of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, earning himself a reputation as an interpreter of Mozart&#x27;s work. He also conducted performances of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot;, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;Arabella&quot;, and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;. Invited to the Salzburg Festival, he conducted &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; in 1961, and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; in 1963. During this time, he also gave the first of many performances at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, and conducted the Berlin Philharmonic, London Symphony Orchestra, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, San Francisco Opera, North German Radio Symphony Orchestra, Hamburg Symphony, Munich Philharmonic, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto where he conducted Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;.

Kertész&#x27;s earliest recordings include Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 and Symphony No. 4. Having already recorded for EMI/Columbia records, Kertész now signed an exclusive contract with Decca/London. His British debut was with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra in 1960. He made his US debut during the 1961–62 season, also beginning an association with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra whom he guest-conducted at Tel Aviv&#x27;s Mann Auditorium in March 1962. Eventually, Kertész conducted over 378 compositions with the Israel Philharmonic over an eleven-year period.

===Cologne Opera===
In 1964, Kertész received an appointment as the general music director of the Cologne Opera where he conducted the first German performance of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Stiffelio&quot;, as well as the Mozart operas &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.

While he established a good rapport with the often critical Cologne audience, they were sometimes unhappy with his often fast tempi. His 1970 &quot;Aida&quot;, with Martina Arroyo in the title role, with one interval and some cuts, lasted under three hours.

===London Symphony Orchestra===
Retaining his previous position as director of the Cologne Opera, he also became principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra from 1965 to 1968, and made guest appearances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. During his three years as principal conductor of the LSO, Kertész made recordings of the nine Dvořák symphonies, which included the first complete recording of the Symphony No. 1. The LSO dispensed with him when he sought control of all artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968.

During this period in Kertész&#x27;s career, in 1966 he recorded Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; with Christa Ludwig singing the role of Judith and Walter Berry in the title role. Kertész&#x27;s interpretation of Bartók&#x27;s difficult, brooding work is considered by many to be the benchmark performance of the opera; &quot;the playing of the London Symphony Orchestra, and Kertész&#x27;s instinctive shaping of the drama ... has never been surpassed.&quot;

Kertész was a frequent guest conductor of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and numerous other orchestras. He was appointed principal conductor of the Bamberg Symphony in 1973. The Cleveland Orchestra unsuccessfully bid for his appointment as musical director the year before. In a poll, the Cleveland musicians had given 96 &quot;first-choice&quot; votes to Kertész as the replacement for George Szell, and only two for Lorin Maazel, Cleveland&#x27;s eventual choice. In Chicago, Kertész conducted his first performance at the Ravinia Festival in July 1967; he was the Festival&#x27;s principal conductor from 1970 to 1972.

==Death==
On 16 April 1973, while on a concert tour, Kertész drowned while swimming off the coast of Israel at Herzliya. He had been recording Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme by Haydn&quot;, as well as the complete Brahms symphonies. After his death, and in tribute to him, the Vienna Philharmonic finished recording the &quot;Haydn Variations&quot; without a conductor.

Kertész was survived by his wife, operatic soprano Edith Kertész-Gabry, his children, Gábor, Péter, and Kathrin, his mother, Margit Muresian Kertész Halmos, and his sister, the graphic artist Vera Kertész.

His many recordings include the first complete recording of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;. He was also the first to record the complete Dvořák symphonies and his interpretations of them are still considered classics of their kind. Pianists Clifford Curzon, Hans Richter-Haaser, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Julius Katchen each made records with Kertész. He recorded Kodály&#x27;s &quot;Psalmus Hungaricus&quot; and &quot;Peacock Variations&quot;.

<text>Kirill Petrovich Kondrashin (; – 7 March 1981) was a Soviet and Russian conductor. People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR (1972).

==Early life==
Kondrashin was born in Moscow to a family of orchestral musicians. Having spent many hours at rehearsals, he made a firm decision at the age of 14 to become a conductor. He studied at the Moscow Conservatory from 1931 to 1936 under the conductor Boris Khaikin. Kondrashin began conducting in the Young People&#x27;s Theatre in Moscow in 1931, continuing in the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre three years later. He conducted at the Maly Opera Theatre in Leningrad from 1938 to 1942 and the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow from 1943. His performance of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No.1 attracted the composer&#x27;s attention and led to the formation of a firm friendship. In 1947, he was awarded the Stalin Prize.

==Main career==
In the first International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1958, Kondrashin was the conductor for American pianist Van Cliburn, who won the first prize. Following the competition, he toured the United States with Cliburn, being the first Soviet conductor to visit America since the beginning of the Cold War. They performed and recorded the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.3 and Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No.1, which they had played in the competition. Millions of the recordings were sold in America. And their Tchaikovsky recording for RCA Victor was the first classical LP to sell one million copies. Later, in 1972, a concert performance of Brahms&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 reunited Cliburn and Kondrashin with the Moscow Philharmonic in Moscow; RCA Victor eventually released the recorded performance in 1994, along with a studio recording of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;, on compact disc. Kondrashin was also the artistic director of the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra from 1960 to 1975. During this period he conducted the premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No.4 in December 1961 and No.13 the following year. He conducted several performances in Europe and America with other famous Russian musicians like Rostropovich, Oistrakh, and Richter.

==Exile to Western Europe==
Kondrashin defected from the Soviet Union in December 1978 while touring in the Netherlands and sought political asylum there, whereupon the Soviet regime immediately banned all his previous recordings. He took the post of Permanent Guest Conductor of Amsterdam&#x27;s Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1978 and remained in that position until his death. He also established a brief but fruitful collaboration with the Vienna Philharmonic.

In the Netherlands, he married his assistant and interpreter, musicologist Nolda Broekstra (born 1944). When they first met around 1975, Broekstra was 30 years old and spoke no Russian. Both were married and were not fluent in English, the language they spoke with each other. Yet they fell in love, tried to be together when they could, and exchanged letters. Broekstra diligently started studying Russian and English and quickly mastered both languages. Their family life in the Netherlands was short, as Kondrashin died in Amsterdam from a heart attack in early 1981, on the same day he conducted Mahler&#x27;s First Symphony with the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra. Philips Records issued recordings of some of Kondrashin&#x27;s live concerts with the Concertgebouw Orchestra on LP and CD, including energetic performances of symphonies by Shostakovich. On the recording of Shostakovich&#x27;s sixth symphony Kondrashin can be heard tapping or even pounding his foot as he conducts the lively final movement. In 1971, he publicly supported the American communist activist Angela Davis.

<text>Stefano Infessura (c. 1435 – c. 1500) was an Italian humanist historian and lawyer. He is remembered through his municipalist &quot;Diary of the City of Rome&quot;, a partisan chronicle of events at Rome by the Colonna family&#x27;s point of view. He was in a position to hear everything that circulated in informed Roman circles, for he was the longtime secretary of the Roman Senate. Anecdotes that Infessura relates may be colored by his own partisan nature, but his diary faithfully records news that was making the rounds in the city, whether true or not; &quot;he inserted every fragment of the most preposterous and malevolent gossip current in Roman society, and is therefore not considered a reliable chronicler&quot; (&quot;New Catholic Dictionary&quot;).

Infessura&#x27;s diary, partly in Latin and partly in ancient Romanesco, the &quot;Diarium urbis Romae (Diario della Città di Roma)&quot; is of special firsthand value for the pontificates of Paul II (1464-1471), Sixtus IV (1471-1484), Innocent VIII (1484-1492), and the beginning of Alexander VI&#x27;s pontificate.

Infessura took a degree of Doctor of Laws and served as a judge, before he came to the University of Rome as professor of Roman law. According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;Under Sixtus IV, his office was affected by the financial measures of that pope, who frequently withheld the income of the Roman University, applied it to other uses, and reduced the salaries of the professors&quot;. That may not provide adequate motivation for Infessura&#x27;s deep opposition to Sixtus&#x27; policies, and for anecdotes that would be certainly scurrilous if they are untrue.

Infessura became entangled in the conspiracy of Stefano Porcari against Nicholas V (1453), which aimed at overturning the papal secular powers in Rome and the Papal States and reviving the Roman republic of antiquity. Among the paganizing Humanists of the Roman Academy under Pomponio Leto, Infessura certainly belonged to the antipapal faction.

Papst and other Catholic authors take pains to discredit the story of Innocent VIII&#x27;s deathbed. As the Pope sank into a coma, &quot;the harrowing story was told that, at the suggestion of a Jewish physician, the blood of three boys was infused into the dying pontiff’s mouth (the concept of circulation and methods for intravenous access did not exist at that time). They were ten years old, and had been promised a ducat each. All three died.&quot; Historians of medicine note this event as the first recorded historical attempt at a blood transfusion.

<doc id="317934" wikidata="Q1130590" url="?curid=317934" title="The Cask of Amontillado">
<text>&quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; is a short story by the American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in the November 1846 issue of &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;. The story, set in an unnamed Italian city at carnival time, is about a man taking fatal revenge on a friend who, he believes, has insulted him. Like several of Poe&#x27;s stories, and in keeping with the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative follows a person being buried alive – in this case, by immurement. As in &quot;The Black Cat&quot; and &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, Poe conveys the story from the murderer&#x27;s perspective.

Montresor invites Fortunato to sample amontillado that he has ostensibly purchased without proving its authenticity. Intrigued by the promise of fine wine and having already drunk enough to impair his judgment, Fortunato follows him into the Montresor family vaults, which also serve as catacombs. However, there is no amontillado; Montresor instead lures him into a trap, entombing him alive within the catacombs. At the end of the story, Montresor reveals that fifty years have passed since he took revenge and Fortunato&#x27;s body has not been disturbed.

Scholars have noted that Montresor&#x27;s reasons for revenge are unclear and that he may simply be insane. However, Poe also leaves clues that Montresor has lost his family&#x27;s prior status and blames Fortunato. Further, Fortunato is depicted as an expert on wine, which Montresor exploits in his plot, but he does not display the type of respect towards alcohol expected of such experts. Poe may have been inspired to write the story by his own real-life desire for revenge against contemporary literary rivals. The story has been frequently adapted in multiple forms since its original publication.

==Plot summary==

The story&#x27;s narrator, a nobleman named Montresor, describes his revenge against fellow noble Fortunato. Angry over numerous injuries and an unspecified insult, Montresor resolves to avenge himself without being caught, and also to make sure that Fortunato knows he is responsible.

During the annual Carnival season, Montresor finds a drunken Fortunato and asks for his help in authenticating a recently purchased pipe (about 130 gallons, or 492 litres) of what has been described to him as Amontillado wine. As the two descend to the wine cellars and catacombs beneath Montresor&#x27;s home, Montresor expresses concern over Fortunato&#x27;s persistent cough and the effect that the dampness will have on his health. Undeterred, Fortunato presses on, intent on sampling the Amontillado, and Montresor gives him more wine to keep him inebriated. Montresor describes his family coat of arms: a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot&#x27;s heel, with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit (&quot;No one provokes me with impunity&quot;). At one point, Fortunato makes a gesture that Montresor does not recognize and deduces that Montresor is not a mason. Montresor shows him a trowel as a joke, deliberately confusing Freemasonry with the profession of stonemasonry.

They arrive at a niche deep within the catacombs, where Montresor claims the Amontillado is stored. When Fortunato ventures inside, Montresor chains him to the wall, having devised the Amontillado ruse to lure him into this trap. Montresor sets to work walling up the niche, using supplies of stone and mortar he had previously hidden nearby. Fortunato quickly sobers up and tries to escape, but Montresor mocks his cries for help, knowing that no one can hear them. While Montresor continues to work, Fortunato tries to persuade Montresor to release him, first by suggesting that they treat the incident as a practical joke, and finally making a last desperate plea. As he falls silent, Montresor completes the wall and moves a pile of bones to hide it, feeling a sickness of heart that he dismisses as a reaction to the dampness of the catacombs.

Stating that the niche and Fortunato&#x27;s body have stood undisturbed for 50 years, Montresor concludes his account by saying, &quot;In pace requiescat!&quot; (&quot;May he rest in peace!&quot;).

==Publication history==

&quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; was first published in the November 1846 issue of &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;, which was, at the time, the most popular periodical in America. The story was only published one additional time during Poe&#x27;s life, in the November 14, 1846 &quot;New England Weekly Review&quot;.

==Analysis==
Although the subject matter of Poe&#x27;s story is a murder, &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; is not a tale of detection like &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; or &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;; there is no investigation of Montresor&#x27;s crime and the criminal himself explains how he committed the murder. The mystery in &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; is in Montresor&#x27;s motive for murder. Without a detective in the story, it is up to the reader to solve the mystery. From the beginning of the story, it is made clear that Montresor has exaggerated his grievances towards Fortunato. The reader is led to assume that much like his exaggerated grievances, the punishment he chooses will represent what he believes is equal justice, and in turn, going to the extreme.

Montresor never specifies his motive beyond the vague &quot;thousand injuries&quot; and &quot;when he ventured upon insult&quot; to which he refers. Some context is provided, including Montresor&#x27;s observation that his family once was great (but no longer so), and Fortunato&#x27;s belittling remarks about Montresor&#x27;s exclusion from Freemasonry. Many commentators conclude that, lacking significant reason, Montresor must be insane, though even this is questionable because of the intricate details of the plot.

There is also evidence that Montresor is almost as clueless about his motive for revenge as his victim. In his recounting of the murder, Montresor notes, &quot;A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong&quot;. After Fortunato is chained to the wall and nearly entombed alive, Montresor merely mocks and mimics him, rather than disclosing to Fortunato the reasons behind his exacting revenge. Montresor may not have been entirely certain of the exact nature of the insults for which he expected Fortunato to atone.

Additional scrutiny into the vague injuries and insults may have to do with a simple matter of Montresor&#x27;s pride and not any specific words from Fortunato. Montresor comes from an established family. His house had once been noble and respected, but has fallen slightly in status. Fortunato, as his name would seem to indicate, has been blessed with good fortune and wealth and is, therefore, viewed as unrefined by Montresor; however, this lack of refinement has not stopped Fortunato from surpassing Montresor in society, which could very well be the &quot;insult&quot; motive for Montresor&#x27;s revenge.

There is indication that Montresor blames his unhappiness and loss of respect and dignity within society on Fortunato. It is easy to ascertain that Fortunato is a Freemason, while Montresor is not, which could be the source of Fortunato&#x27;s recent ascension into upper class society. Montresor even imparts this blame to Fortunato when he states, &quot;You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was&quot;. This interchanging of fortunes is a suggestion that, since the names Montresor and Fortunato mirror one another, there is a psychological reciprocal identification between victim and executioner. This identification reciprocity is further suggested when one takes into consideration that Montresor entombs Fortunato in the Montresor family catacombs rather than dispatching him elsewhere in the city amidst the chaos of the Carnival. It is with this converging of the two characters that one is able to see the larger symbolism of the Montresor crest – the foot steps on the serpent while the serpent forever has his fangs embedded in the heel.

Upon further investigation into the true nature of character, double meaning can be derived from the Montresor crest. It is the position of Montresor to view himself as the owner of the righteous foot that is crushing the insolent Fortunato serpent and his &quot;thousand injuries&quot; that progress into insult. A more allegoric meaning of Poe&#x27;s places the actors in reverse. The blind oaf Fortunato has unintentionally stepped upon the snake in the grass – the sneaky and cunning Montresor – who, as a reward for this accidental bruising, sinks his fangs deep into the heel of his offender, forever linking them in a form of mutual existence.

Though Fortunato is presented as a connoisseur of fine wine, his actions in the story make that assumption questionable. For example, Fortunato comments on another nobleman being unable to distinguish amontillado from sherry when amontillado is in fact a type of sherry, and treats De Grave, an expensive French wine, with very little regard by drinking it in a single gulp. Because intoxication interferes with critical evaluation, and would be avoided by a connoisseur during a wine tasting, it is implied within the story that Fortunato is merely an alcoholic. Under this interpretation, Fortunato&#x27;s fate could also have been retribution for wasting a bottle of fine wine.

Immurement, a form of imprisonment, usually for life, in which a person is placed within an enclosed space with no exit, is featured in several other works by Poe, including &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, &quot;The Premature Burial&quot;, &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, and &quot;Berenice&quot;.

==Inspiration==
An apocryphal legend holds that the inspiration for &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; came from a story Poe had heard at Castle Island (South Boston), Massachusetts, when he was a private stationed at Fort Independence in 1827. According to this legend, he saw a monument to Lieutenant Robert Massie. Historically, Massie had been killed in a sword duel on Christmas Day 1817 by Lieutenant Gustavus Drane, following a dispute during a card game. The legend states other soldiers then took revenge on Drane by getting him drunk, luring him into the dungeon, chaining him to a wall, and sealing him in a vault. This version of Drane&#x27;s demise is false; Drane was courtmartialled for the killing and acquitted, and lived until 1846. A report of a skeleton discovered on the island may be a confused remembering of Poe&#x27;s major source, Joel Headley&#x27;s &quot;A Man Built in a Wall&quot;, which recounts the author&#x27;s seeing an immured skeleton in the wall of a church in Italy. Headley&#x27;s story includes details very similar to &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;; in addition to walling an enemy into a hidden niche, the story details the careful placement of the bricks, the motive of revenge, and the victim&#x27;s agonized moaning. Poe may have also seen similar themes in Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;La Grande Bretèche&quot; (&quot;Democratic Review&quot;, November 1843) or his friend George Lippard&#x27;s &quot;The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall&quot; (1845). Poe may have borrowed Montresor&#x27;s family motto &quot;Nemo me impune lacessit&quot; from James Fenimore Cooper, who used the line in &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1826).
Poe wrote his tale, however, as a response to his personal rival Thomas Dunn English. Poe and English had several confrontations, usually revolving around literary caricatures of one another. Poe thought that one of English&#x27;s writings went a bit too far, and successfully sued the other man&#x27;s editors at the &quot;New York Mirror&quot; for libel in 1846. That year, English published a revenge-based novel called &quot;1844, or, The Power of the S.F.&quot; Its plot was convoluted and difficult to follow, but made references to secret societies and ultimately had a main theme of revenge. It included a character named Marmaduke Hammerhead, the famous author of &quot;The Black Crow&quot;, who uses phrases like &quot;Nevermore&quot; and &quot;lost Lenore&quot;, referring to Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot;. This parody of Poe was depicted as a drunkard, liar, and an abusive lover.

Poe responded with &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;, using very specific references to English&#x27;s novel. In Poe&#x27;s story, for example, Fortunato makes reference to the secret society of Masons, similar to the secret society in &quot;1844&quot;, and even makes a gesture similar to one portrayed in &quot;1844&quot; (it was a signal of distress). English had also used an image of a token with a hawk grasping a snake in its claws, similar to Montresor&#x27;s coat of arms bearing a foot stomping on a snake – though in this image, the snake is biting the heel. In fact, much of the scene of &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; comes from a scene in &quot;1844&quot; that takes place in a subterranean vault. In the end, then, it is Poe who &quot;punishes with impunity&quot; by not taking credit for his own literary revenge and by crafting a concise tale (as opposed to a novel) with a singular effect, as he had suggested in his essay &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot;.

Poe may have also been inspired, at least in part, by the Washingtonian movement, a fellowship that promoted temperance. The group was made up of reformed drinkers who tried to scare people into abstaining from alcohol. Poe may have made a promise to join the movement in 1843 after a bout of drinking with the hopes of gaining a political appointment. &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; then may be a &quot;dark temperance tale&quot;, meant to shock people into realizing the dangers of drinking.

Poe scholar Richard P. Benton has stated his belief that &quot;Poe&#x27;s protagonist is an Englished version of the French Montrésor&quot; and has argued forcefully that Poe&#x27;s model for Montresor &quot;was Claude de Bourdeille, comte de Montrésor (Count of Montrésor), the 17th-century political conspirator in the entourage of King Louis XIII&#x27;s weak-willed brother, Gaston d&#x27;Orléans&quot;. The &quot;noted intriguer and memoir-writer&quot; was first linked to &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; by Poe scholar Burton R. Pollin.

Further inspiration for the method of Fortunato&#x27;s murder comes from the fear of live burial. During the time period of this short story some coffins were given methods of alerting the outside in the event of live entombment. Items such as bells tied to the limbs of a corpse to signal the outside were not uncommon. This theme is evident in Fortunato&#x27;s costume of a jester with bells upon his hat, and his situation of live entombment within the catacombs.

Poe may have known bricklaying through personal experience. Many periods in Poe&#x27;s life lack significant biographical details, including what he did after leaving the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; in 1837. Poe biographer John H. Ingram wrote to Sarah Helen Whitman that someone named &quot;Allen&quot; said that Poe worked &quot;in the brickyard &#x27;late in the fall of 1834&#x27;&quot;. This source has been identified as Robert T. P. Allen, a fellow West Point student during Poe&#x27;s time there.

* In 2023, Mike Flanagan&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, the story is one of many of Poe&#x27;s works loosely borrowed throughout. It is used as the foundation of the Usher Empire. In the series, antagonist Fortunato is renamed Rufus Griswold, CEO of Fortunato. Madeline and Roderick Usher are substitutes for the narrator. Resolving to murder Rufus for the takeover of the family company resulting in their parents dying penniless and the Ushers growing up in squalor as orphans. They ultimately succeed by means that parallel the story of &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;.
