<text>The Rhino (Aleksei Sytsevich; Russian: Алексей Сицевич) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita Sr., and first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #41 (Oct. 1966). The character is a Russian thug who underwent an experimental procedure that gave him an artificial skin covering and superhuman strength. Rebelling against the scientists responsible for his transformation, Rhino used his newfound powers to become a successful criminal, and soon clashed with superheroes like Spider-Man and the Hulk. The character is typically portrayed as a dimwitted brute, capable of great destruction, but ultimately easily deceived.

One of Spider-Man&#x27;s most prominent adversaries, the Rhino has been adapted into various forms of media since his original debut during the Silver Age of Comic Books, including animated television series and video games. He has also featured in Marvel merchandise such as action figures and trading cards.

In live-action, Paul Giamatti played a version of Aleksei Sytsevich who uses a rhinoceros-themed battle armor, similar to the character&#x27;s Ultimate Marvel incarnation, in the 2014 film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;. Another version appeared in the 2024 Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe film &quot;Kraven the Hunter&quot; played by Alessandro Nivola.

==Publication history==
Described by writer Mike Conroy as &quot;famously one of Spider-Man&#x27;s dimmest villains&quot;, the Rhino debuted in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #41–43 (Oct.–Dec. 1966) as a thug for hire working for an Eastern Bloc country. He volunteers to participate in an experiment that bonds a super-strong polymer to his skin, as well as augmenting his strength and speed. The character returned in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #104 (June 1968), and although he apparently died at the end of the story, he was revived in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #124 (Feb. 1970), becoming a perennial opponent of both Spider-Man and the Hulk.

The character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a villain for hire in over 12 titles. Significant appearances included starring in the limited series &quot;Deadly Foes of Spider-Man&quot; #1–4 (May–Aug. 1991); the &quot;Flowers for Rhino&quot; storyline in &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s Tangled Web&quot; #5–6 (Oct.–Nov. 2001), which is told from the character&#x27;s perspective; and &quot;Punisher War Journal&quot; (vol. 2) #13–15 (Jan.–March 2008), in which Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle. He has also been a member of multiple supervillain teams, including the Emissaries of Evil, the Sinister Syndicate, and the Sinister Six.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Origin and early villainy ===
Aleksei Sytsevich was a low-ranking member of the Russian mafia who willingly underwent a series of chemical and radiation treatments meant to give him an artificial skin covering that would grant superhuman strength. After successfully completing the treatment, Sytsevich rebelled against the Eastern Bloc agents who gave him these powers and sought to use him as a weapon, destroying their laboratory. He was subsequently hired to kidnap Colonel John Jameson and obtain the extraterrestrial spores to which Jameson was exposed during a space mission, but Sytsevich was defeated by the superhero Spider-Man and taken to prison.

After serving his sentence, the Rhino was approached by the same scientists for more augmentation. This time, they used the same gamma radiation that granted the Hulk his abilities to further increase the Rhino&#x27;s strength. They also equipped him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that would further increase his abilities. As repayment, the Rhino agreed to find and kidnap Bruce Banner, the Hulk&#x27;s human alter ego, for his knowledge of gamma radiation. Despite the Rhino&#x27;s training and equipment, he was easily defeated by the Hulk, who placed him in a coma.

Months later, the Rhino was revived by the Leader, who planned to interrupt Banner&#x27;s wedding to Betty Ross. The Leader intended to transform Banner into the Hulk, and wanted the Rhino to protect him from the ensuing rampage. At the wedding, the Rhino betrays the Leader and attacks Banner the moment he transforms. In the resulting chaos, the Rhino is once again comatose, and the Leader briefly takes mental control of Sytsevich&#x27;s body to combat the Hulk. The Leader abandons the Rhino and the Hulk on an alien world, and returns home in a rocket, which crashes on arrival.

The Rhino&#x27;s first collaboration with other villains occurs when he and the Abomination activated a gamma bomb at the Hulkbuster base in an attempt to destroy the Hulk. Although this attempt failed, Egghead recruited the Rhino for his supervillain team, the Emissaries of Evil, where he was paired with Solarr in search of a rare jewel. Rhino and Solarr are defeated by the Defenders, Doctor Strange, and Doc Samson.

Samson took the Rhino to Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., where he was part of a failed prison break involving Moonstone, Blackout, and Electro. While being transferred to another facility, the Miracle Man attempted to free the Rhino, who wanted to stay in P.E.G.A.S.U.S. for medical treatment. The rocket crash had permanently affixed the Rhino&#x27;s costume to his body, and he wanted it separated. He and the Thing successfully stopped Miracle Man, and took the Rhino to a medical facility within P.E.G.A.S.U.S.

When the treatments fail to return the Rhino to normal, he escapes P.E.G.A.S.U.S. and joins the Sinister Syndicate, fighting Spider-Man on multiple occasions. After the team falls apart, the Rhino is hired by the Kingpin under the belief that he can raise the money for more surgery. When he hears the Kingpin tell a group of scientists not to remove the Rhino suit, Sytsevich kidnaps one of their children until they complete the procedure. Sytsevich then requests a removable suit from Justin Hammer, allowing him to continue his life of crime.

Hulk, in the bandaged disguise of &quot;Bob Danner&quot;, played baseball for the Florida Pistols when they competed against the Miami Emperors. One player on the Miami Emperors turns out to be Rhino under the alias of &quot;Alex O&#x27;Hirn&quot;. A fight soon happened between both teams where the baseball players soon left the field when they found out how strong &quot;Bob Danner&quot; and &quot;Alex O&#x27;Hirn&quot; are.

Rhino was among the villains who accompany Klaw in his invasion of Wakanda. It took the Wakandan Air Force to subdue Rhino.

===&quot;Civil War&quot; and aftermath===
When the Rhino accidentally kills a security guard during a bank robbery, he is humiliated by the Punisher, and captured by Alyosha Kravinoff, the son of Kraven the Hunter. The Punisher rescues the Rhino from Kravinoff&#x27;s superhuman zoo, and he is convinced to make amends. The Rhino sends a letter and money to the security guard&#x27;s widow, and aids the Punisher on a case. Later, the Rhino persuades the Punisher not to kill Michael Watts, the third Stilt-Man.

During &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; storyline, the Rhino gives up his life of crime, surrendering himself to the police. S.H.I.E.L.D. removes his Rhino suit and sentences him to 25 years on Ryker&#x27;s Island. He is released early on good behavior, and upon release, he meets Doctor Tramma, who wants to reinvent the Rhino. Sytsevich declines, and Tramma creates a new Rhino. At Spider-Man&#x27;s persuasion, Sytsevich refuses to fight the new Rhino. That promise is broken when Sytsevich&#x27;s wife Oksana is killed, and a grief-stricken Sytsevich kills the new Rhino.

Doctor Octopus recruits the Rhino for his iteration of the Sinister Six. During the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline, the Rhino tells Spider-Man that the loss of his wife has changed him, and he is prepared to die. When Doctor Octopus self-destructs his own lair, the Rhino pins Silver Sable to the floor of a flooding corridor, knowing that Spider-Man will blame himself for his fellow hero&#x27;s death. He is presumed drowned, and while in Doctor Octopus&#x27; dying body, Spider-Man meets Oksana and the Rhino in the afterlife.

=== &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; ===
As part of the lead-up to the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, the Rhino resurfaces, having survived his apparent demise. The Jackal finds Sytsevich in hiding in Tahuexco, Guatemala, where he persuades the Rhino to do his bidding with the promise of a revived Oksana. When Doctor Octopus activates a virus in all of the Jackal&#x27;s clones that causes them to rapidly decay, Oksana turns to dust, and the Rhino goes on a grief-stricken rampage. Spider-Man calms him by convincing him to move forward for his wife&#x27;s sake, and the two agree to see each other once in a while to help the other with their pain.

In a prelude to the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, the Rhino is among the animal-themed characters captured by the Taskmaster and the Black Ant on behalf of Kraven the Hunter. He is among those who Arcade publicly reveals as the Savage Six.

During the &quot;King in Black&quot; storyline, Rhino is among the villains recruited by Mayor Wilson Fisk to be part of his Thunderbolts at the time of Knull&#x27;s invasion. Following the deaths of Ampere and Snakehead, Taskmaster couldn&#x27;t bring himself to prevent Rhino from walking away.

During the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Rhino accompanied the Savage Six into attacking the premiere of the movie which Mysterio was involved in. This led up to the Savage Six also fighting the Sinister Six.

During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Rhino appears as a member of Mayor Wilson Fisk&#x27;s latest incarnation of the Thunderbolts when Mayor Fisk passes a law that forbids superhero activities. He assisted Agony, Electro II, and U.S. Agent in taking down Moon Knight. In truth, Rhino did not sign up to dispose underage superheroes after learning the Kamala&#x27;s Law incidents in &quot;Outlawed&quot; and its conclusion in &quot;Killer App&quot;, so he secretly helps the Champions by giving them the Thunderbolts badge due to Fisk&#x27;s patrol system becoming even tighter with Doctor Octopus&#x27; Octobots and many innocent people being unsaved. It was because of Rhino declaring himself out of the Thunderbolts because of this reason that caused Mayor Fisk to bring in Abomination as a replacement.

Orchis later subjected Rhino to the same mind-control device that they used on Nightcrawler. He went on a rampage until he fought Nightcrawler&#x27;s Spinnenmann appearance. Despite interference from Silver Sable and the Wild Pack, Spinnenmann defeated Rhino.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
A series of mutagenic chemical and radiation treatments provide the Rhino with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and speed, all which were further augmented by gamma rays. His incredible speed allows him to run at high velocities, especially over short distances. Sytsevich frequently &quot;charges&quot; his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies in the surrounding area. He is, however, notorious for his lack of agility and slow reaction time, which makes it difficult for him to change direction when running at high speeds. As such, his fighting style is focused more on melee attacks.

===Rhino suit===
Sytsevich possesses a thick polymer suit that resembles the physique of a rhinoceros, including two horns, and covers everything but his face. The suit is resistant to damage and extreme temperatures and these horns are capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first, cruder suit was originally bonded to his skin during a rocket crash and he went through several attempts to remove it.

After the first suit&#x27;s destruction, Justin Hammer created a second, removable iteration with improved strength and durability.

==Other characters named Rhino==
===Doctor Tramma&#x27;s Rhino===
When Aleksei Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma&#x27;s offer to return to the Rhino role, Tramma finds another subject and equips him with a high-tech suit that was supposed to be given to Sytsevich. The second Rhino comes after Sytsevich, feeling that he had to destroy the original Rhino if he was going to ascend. Spider-Man defeats the second Rhino, who then escapes.

While lifting a makeshift dumbbell made out of a pole and two trucks, the second Rhino is called up by a mysterious person telling him where he can find Sytsevich. Rhino attacks Aleksei at one of J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s press meetings. Aleksei lies to the second Rhino, agreeing to fight him in his Rhino suit, but instead goes into hiding with his wife Oksana. Before they arrive at their safehouse, however, the second Rhino attacks again, and Oksana dies as a result. Aleksei dons his old Rhino suit, which is strong enough to destroy the new Rhino&#x27;s, and kills the unnamed wearer.

===Ryan O&#x27;Smith===
A man named Ryan O&#x27;Smith was experimented on by an unnamed mad scientist where the experiment gave him flight and wanted to be a superhero. When he wanted to be a heroic Rhino after meeting Spider-Man, he would be targeted by the original Rhino which led to Ryan and Spider-Man defeating Rhino.

<text>Metro Area is a Brooklyn-based house and nu-disco duo formed in 1998 by Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani.

== History ==
Geist grew up in Wayne, New Jersey, while Jesrani is from upstate New York. Both arrived at electronic music through their interest in rock music, with Geist through the electronic sound effects he noticed in progressive rock songs and Jesrani through the electronic introduction to Rush&#x27;s song Tom Sawyer, which he says &quot;led me into Devo, Thomas Dolby&quot; in which both had been producing music independently since the mid-90s. Before forming Metro Area, Geist attended Oberlin College (where he founded his record label, Environ, in 1995) and was responsible for a number of highly regarded solo releases, while Jesrani began his production career as half of the groups Essa 3 and Acronym City. The two met through internet mailing lists in 1995 or 1996. After collaborating under the names &quot;Sage.&quot; and &quot;Phenom,&quot; they began Metro Area in 1998, releasing four 12&quot;s on Environ under that name between 1999 and 2001. Edits of six tracks from these releases later turned up on their 2002 self-titled album, which received good reception, being named as &quot;the second best album of the decade&quot; by &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; and &quot;the nineteenth best album of the decade&quot; by &quot;Fact&quot; magazine. Both Jesrani and Geist are DJs as well as producers; in 2002 and 2003 they hosted a monthly residency at APT in the Meatpacking District, called Party Out of Bounds.

Morgan Geist also works under the name &#x27;Storm Queen&#x27; and is best known for the successful single &quot;Look Right Through&quot;, made popular as a dub version by Marc Kinchen.

<text>A string figure is a design formed by manipulating string on, around, and using one&#x27;s fingers or sometimes between the fingers of multiple people. String figures may also involve the use of the mouth, wrist, and feet. They may consist of singular images or be created and altered as a game, known as a string game, or as part of a story involving various figures made in sequence (string story). String figures have also been used for divination, such as to predict the sex of an unborn child.

A popular string game is cat&#x27;s cradle, but many string figures are known in many places under different names, and string figures are well distributed throughout the world.

==History==
According to Camilla Gryski, a Canadian librarian and author of numerous string figure books, &quot;We don&#x27;t know when people first started playing with string, or which primitive people invented this ancient art. We do know that all primitive societies had and used string—for hunting, fishing, and weaving—and that string figures have been collected from native peoples all over the world.&quot;

&quot;Of the games people play, string figures enjoy the reputation of being the most widespread form of amusement in the world: more cultures are familiar with string figures than with any other game. Over 2,000 individual patterns have been recorded worldwide since the 19th century. It was long believed that anthropologist Franz Boas was the first to describe the construction of string figures (a pair of Inuit string figures) in 1888 (Boas 1888a, 1888b, Abraham 1988:12).&quot;, but actually string figure instructions already feature in several 19th century European books on children&#x27;s games prior to that. 

String figures are probably one of humanity&#x27;s oldest games, and are spread among an astonishing variety of cultures, even ones as unrelated as Europeans and the Dayaks of Indonesia; Alfred Wallace who, while traveling in Borneo in the 1800s, thought of amusing the Dayak youths with a novel game with string, was in turn very surprised when they proved to be familiar with it, and showed him some figures and transitions that he hadn&#x27;t previously seen. The anthropologist Louis Leakey has also attributed string figure knowledge with saving his life and described his use of this game in the early 1900s to obtain the cooperation of Sub-Saharan African tribes otherwise unfamiliar with, and suspicious of, Europeans, having been told by his teacher A.C. Haddon, &quot;You can travel anywhere with a smile and a piece of string.&quot;

The Greek physician Heraklas produced the earliest known written description of a string figure in his first century monograph on surgical knots and slings. This work was preserved by republication in Oribasius&#x27; fourth century &quot;Medical Collections&quot;. The figure is described as a sling to set and bind a broken jaw, with the chin being placed in the center of the figure and the four loops tied near the top of the head. Called the &quot;Plinthios Brokhos&quot;, the resulting figure has been identified by multiple sources as the figure known to Aboriginal Australians as &quot;The Sun Clouded Over&quot;. The Inuit are purported to possess a string figure representing the extinct woolly mammoth.


String figures were widely studied by anthropologists like James Hornell from the 1880s through around 1900, as they were used in attempts to trace the origin and developments of cultures. String figures, once thought to have proven monogenesis, appear to have arisen independently as an entertainment pastime in many societies. Many figures were collected and described from south-east Asia, Japan, South America, West Indies, Pacific Islanders, Inuit and other Native Americans. Figures have also been collected in Europe and Africa. One of the major works on the subject is &quot;String Figures and How to Make Them&quot; (), by Caroline Furness Jayne.

The International String Figure Association (ISFA) was formed in 1978 with the primary goal of gathering, preserving, and distributing string figure knowledge so that future generations will continue to enjoy this ancient pastime.

==Terminology==

While in string figure literature there are many phrases often used, there may be some variation with the fingers, loops, and strings indicated in different ways. A &quot;loop&quot; consists of the strings that go around the back of a finger, multiple fingers, or another body part such as the wrist. Some authors name the strings, fingers and their loops (near middle finger string, right index finger, pinky loop, for example), while others number them (3n, R1, 5 loop). One of the first methods of recording figures and sets of terminology was an anatomical system proposed in &quot;A Method of Recording String Figures and Tricks&quot; by W. H. R. Rivers and A. C. Haddon. Though location or locations of a string are most often indicated by casual systems of terms such as &quot;near&quot; or &quot;far&quot;, the Rivers and Haddon system is far less ambiguous, though this may be unnecessary for the most common, illustrated, figures.

Below are some common moves, openings, and extensions.
*Openings
** Murray Opening/Index Opening: The loop is grasped with the middle, ring, and little fingers so that there is a couple inches of string between them. These fingers are put together so there is a circle made by the overlapping strings. The index finger is inserted from the far side into the circle, and the index finger rotated upwards, circling towards the body.
** Position 1: The &quot;untwisted&quot; loop is put on the thumb and little fingers.
** Opening A: Following from Position 1, the right index finger picks up the string on the left hand going between the thumb and the little finger. The left index finger then goes between both strings of right index finger, and picks up the string going from the right thumb to little finger.
** Opening B: Place the loop around one&#x27;s thumbs, then insert the left index proximally into the thumb loop, taking up the left ulnar thumb string. Insert one&#x27;s right finger proximally into the left index loop, taking up the radial string and forming an x.
** Japanese Opening: The Japanese Opening is similar to Opening A, however the strings are picked up with the middle fingers instead of the index fingers.
*Extensions
** Caroline Extension: Starting with a loop on the thumb, the string is lifted in the nook of the index finger, then pinched between the index finger and thumb.
*Moves
**Pick up
** Navajo leap, &quot;navajoing&quot;, or &quot;Navajo&quot;: Given two loops on one finger, the lower loop is moved over the upper loop and released from the finger.
**Release
**Transfer
**Rotate
**Share
** (Eskimo–Aleut for:put two things together): the thumbs loops are combined before strings are drawn through them

<doc id="315896" wikidata="Q324286" url="?curid=315896" title="BookCrossing">
<text>BookCrossing (also known as BC, BCing or BXing) is defined as the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be &#x27;caught&#x27; by others, who may then do likewise. The term is derived from bookcrossing.com, a free online book community which was founded in 2001 to encourage the practice, aiming to &quot;make the whole world a library.&quot;

The &quot;crossing&quot; or exchanging of books may take any of a number of forms, including the &#x27;wild-release&#x27; of a book in public places (when the receiver of the book is unknown), controlled release (when the receiver of the book is known) with other members of the websites, or &quot;book rings&quot; in which books travel in a set order to participants who want to read a certain book. The community aspect of BookCrossing.com has grown and expanded in ways which were not expected at the outset, in the form of blog or forum discussions, mailing lists, and holding annual conventions throughout the world.

==History==
The idea for what is now known as BookCrossing was conceived in March 2001 by Ron Hornbaker in the US. Business partners and co-founders Bruce and Heather Pedersen collaborated with Hornbaker to launch BookCrossing.com on April 21, 2001. Both Bruce and Hornbaker have been veterinarians and Heather was a stockbroker.

After two years the website had over 113,000 members and by 2004 it was prominent enough to be referenced in an episode of the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. In the same year it appeared as a new word in the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary,&quot; although as of 2017, only the Collins English dictionary retained it as a word.

Membership surpassed one million by March 2012 and the registered book count exceeded 8.5 million. By November 2019, there were over 1.9 million members and over 13 million books travelling through 132 countries, of which over 25 thousand books newly &quot;released in the wild&quot; in the previous month across over 60 countries, with over 80% of the books being released in the 8 most active countries (Germany, United States, Spain, Italy, Australia, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Brazil), while 30 countries had seen a book release in the previous 3 days.

In July 2007 Singapore became the first country to give the practice official status, designating 2,000 locations in the country as &#x27;hotspots&#x27;, similar to Official BookCrossing Zones (OBCZ), in an initiative launched with the National Library of Singapore. The world&#x27;s first official International BookCrossing Day took place on 21 April 2014. BookCrossing is actively developing in the countries of Eastern Europe, in particular Ukraine since 2021 in small and large cities.

===Awards===
In May 2005 BookCrossing.com won two People&#x27;s Voice awards in the Webby Awards for best community website and best social/networking website. BookCrossing was also featured in a BBC Radio project broadcast as 84 Book Crossing Road, which involved releasing 84 copies of Helene Hanff&#x27;s book &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; around the world. The program was nominated for a Sony Radio Academy Award in 2006.

==Process==
Anyone who wishes to officially participate in &quot;releasing&quot; books, whether leaving in a public place or passing it on to a friend, may register on the BookCrossing.com website, although there is the option to remain anonymous when &quot;catching&quot; or recording the find of a book. BookCrossing.com users can &#x27;go hunting&#x27;, where a member will go to the website to view a list of books that have recently been &quot;released&quot;, then go to the location it was left to &quot;catch&quot; it.

Books may also be left at &quot;Official BookCrossing Zones&quot; (OBCZs), which are in certain coffee shops, cafes, and restaurants, or other public places. The purpose of the zones is to motivate current members in the area to leave books to share with the public. It advertises BookCrossing and adds more members.

==Conventions==
There is a BookCrossing anniversary convention every April, where BookCrossers go to enjoy organized literary-related events and release books together. 

The location of the convention changes each year; here is a list of past and forthcoming conventions:

Many unofficial conventions or &quot;un-conventions&quot; take place at other locations and times throughout the year, making it easier for BookCrossers who cannot travel internationally for the convention, to gather and share their love of books.

==Controversy and criticism==
In 2003, BookCrossing was criticized by the astrologer and novelist Jessica Adams, who claimed that books were being &quot;devalued&quot; by the website as BookCrossing could lead to lower sales of books and, therefore, the reduction in royalties being paid to authors. Most BookCrossers dispute this argument, however. They claim that the website introduces readers to authors and genres that they have not read before, that the website encourages more people to take up or reclaim reading as a hobby, and that some members, having read a book that they have enjoyed, will buy extra copies to distribute through BookCrossing.

In March 2005, Caroline Martin, managing director of the publisher Harper Press, said in a speech that &quot;book publishing as a whole has its very own potential Napster crisis in the growing practice of bookcrossing&quot;. BookCrossers rebutted the link to Napster, saying that while music file sharing involves duplicating audio files countless times, BookCrossing doesn&#x27;t involve duplicating books (and also does not involve violating copyright, as books can be sold or given away freely without permission of the publisher being needed; copyright, the intellectual property, still remains with the creator or publisher). 

When BookCrossing was first launched, the founder of BookCrossing, Ron Hornbaker, originally wondered if people would make this comparison.

<doc id="315897" wikidata="Q3289310" url="?curid=315897" title="Microphylls and megaphylls">
<text>In plant anatomy and evolution a microphyll (or lycophyll) is a type of plant leaf with one single, unbranched leaf vein. Plants with microphyll leaves occur early in the fossil record, and few such plants exist today. In the classical concept of a microphyll, the leaf vein emerges from the protostele without leaving a leaf gap. Leaf gaps are small areas above the node of some leaves where there is no vascular tissue, as it has all been diverted to the leaf. Megaphylls, in contrast, have multiple veins within the leaf and leaf gaps above them in the stem.

==Leaf vasculature==

The clubmosses and horsetails have microphylls, as in all extant species there is only a single vascular trace in each leaf. These leaves are narrow because the width of the blade is limited by the distance water can efficiently diffuse cell-to-cell from the central vascular strand to the margin of the leaf. Despite their name, microphylls are not always small: those of &quot;Isoëtes&quot; can reach 25 centimetres in length, and the extinct &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; bore microphylls up to 78 cm long. 

===Evolution===
The enation theory of microphyll evolution posits that small outgrowths, or enations, developed from the side of early stems (such as those found in the Zosterophylls). Outgrowths of the protostele (the central vasculature) later emerged towards the enations (as in &quot;Asteroxylon&quot;), and eventually continued to grow fully into the leaf to form the mid-vein (such as in &quot;Baragwanathia&quot;). The fossil record appears to display these traits in this order, but this may be a coincidence, as the record is incomplete. The telome theory proposes instead that both microphylls and megaphylls originated by the reduction; microphylls by reduction of a single &quot;telome&quot; branch, and megaphylls by evolution from branched portions of a telome.

The simplistic evolutionary models, however, do not correspond well to evolutionary relationships. Some genera of ferns display complex leaves that are attached to the pseudostele by an outgrowth of the vascular bundle, leaving no leaf gap. Horsetails (&quot;Equisetum&quot;) bear only a single vein, and appear to be microphyllous; however, the fossil record suggests that their forebears had leaves with complex venation, and their current state is a result of secondary simplification. Some gymnosperms bear needles with only one vein, but these evolved later from plants with complex leaves.

An interesting case is that of &quot;Psilotum&quot;, which has a (simple) protostele, and enations devoid of vascular tissue. Some species of &quot;Psilotum&quot; have a single vascular trace that terminates at the base of the enations. Consequently, &quot;Psilotum&quot; was long thought to be a &quot;living fossil&quot; closely related to early land plants (rhyniophytes). However, genetic analysis has shown &quot;Psilotum&quot; to be a reduced fern.

It is not clear whether leaf gaps are a homologous trait of megaphyllous organisms or have evolved more than once.

While the simple definitions (microphylls: one vein, macrophylls: more than one) can still be used in modern botany, the evolutionary history is harder to decipher.

<text>Bruce Arthur Johnston (born Benjamin Baldwin; June 27, 1942) is an American singer, musician, and songwriter who is a member of the Beach Boys. He also collaborated on many records with Terry Melcher (his bandmate in Bruce &amp; Terry, the Rip Chords, and California Music) and composed the 1975 Barry Manilow hit, &quot;I Write the Songs&quot;.

Born in Illinois, Johnston grew up in Los Angeles and studied classical piano in his early years. While in high school, he arranged and played on his first hit record, Sandy Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Teen Beat&quot; (1959), and also worked with musicians such as Kim Fowley and Phil Spector. One of Johnston&#x27;s first gigs was as a member of the surf band the Gamblers before becoming a staff producer at Columbia Records.

In 1965, Johnston joined the Beach Boys for live performances, initially filling in for the group&#x27;s co-founder Brian Wilson. Johnston&#x27;s first appearance on the band&#x27;s records was as a vocalist on &quot;California Girls&quot; (1965). He later contributed original material to the group&#x27;s albums, including &quot;The Nearest Faraway Place&quot; on &quot;20/20&quot; (1969), &quot;Tears in the Morning&quot; and &quot;Deirdre&quot; on &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970), and &quot;Disney Girls (1957)&quot; on &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (1971).

Johnston left the Beach Boys in 1972 and subsequently embarked on a solo career. During this time, Johnston recorded one solo album, &quot;Going Public&quot; (1977), his latest to date. In late 1978, he rejoined the Beach Boys to co-produce the group&#x27;s &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; (1979). Since then, he has continued to tour as a member of the band.

==Background==
Born in Peoria, Illinois in 1942 at the Florence Crittenden Home, he was adopted as a child by William and Irene Johnston of Chicago and grew up in the wealthy Los Angeles neighborhoods of Brentwood and Bel-Air. His adoptive family is of Irish descent, with his grandparents hailing from Markethill, County Armagh. His adoptive father was president of the Owl Rexall Drug Company in Los Angeles after moving from Walgreens in Chicago. 

Johnston attended the private Bel Air Town and Country School (later renamed John Thomas Dye School) and the University of California, Los Angeles. He also studied classical piano in his early years, training at Interlochen Arts Camp as a youth.

==Early career==

In high school, Johnston switched to contemporary music. He performed in a few &quot;beginning&quot; bands during this time and then moved on to working with young musicians such as Sandy Nelson, Kim Fowley, and Phil Spector. 
Soon, Johnston began backing people such as Ritchie Valens, the Everly Brothers, and Eddie Cochran. 

In 1959, while still in high school, Johnston arranged and played on his first hit record, &quot;Teen Beat&quot; by Sandy Nelson. The single reached the Billboard Top Ten. The same year, Johnston made his first single under his own name, &quot;Take This Pearl&quot; on Arwin Records (a record label owned by Doris Day) as part of the Bruce &amp; Jerry duo (Jerry Cooper was a high school friend of Bruce&#x27;s). The teenage Hot Rod film entitled &quot;Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow&quot; (1959), features the song &quot;I Promise You&quot; by Johnston and Judy Harriet.

In 1960, Johnston started his record production career at Del-Fi Records, producing five singles and an album – &quot;Love You So&quot; – by Ron Holden (many of the album&#x27;s eleven tracks were written or co-written by Johnston). 

In 1962 and 1963, Johnston continued his recording career with a series of surfin&#x27; singles (vocal &amp; instrumental) and an album, &quot;Surfin&#x27; &#x27;Round the World&quot;, credited to Bruce Johnston, and another &quot;live&quot; album, the Bruce Johnston Surfin&#x27; Band&#x27;s &quot;Surfer&#x27;s Pajama Party&quot;. In 1963 came the first collaboration with his friend Terry Melcher (Doris Day&#x27;s son), a mostly instrumental covers album credited to the Hot Doggers.

The first artist that Johnston and Melcher produced was a group called the Rip Chords. The pair were then working as staff producers at Columbia Records, Hollywood, and by the time they were producing the million-selling &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot;, a knock-off of the Beach Boys car song vocal style, they also wound up singing every layered vocal part for the recording. The two of them made a few recordings as Bruce &amp; Terry and the Rogues, but Melcher began to focus more on his production career (with the Byrds, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders).

==Original tenure with the Beach Boys==

On April 9, 1965, Johnston joined the Beach Boys in New Orleans, replacing Glen Campbell, who briefly filled in as a touring member for Brian Wilson, and had declined an offer to officially join the band. Johnston did not start playing bass until his first tenure with the Beach Boys, and the first contributions Johnston made as one of the Beach Boys was on &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;. For contractual reasons, however, he was not credited on a Beach Boys album cover until &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (1967) though he was photographed as a touring band member on the back sleeve of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966).

In May 1966, Johnston flew to London and played &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966) for John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Keith Moon. Johnston provided backing vocals to six of the album&#x27;s 13 tracks: &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot;, &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Not Me&quot;, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; (also co-lead), &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, and &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&quot;. He similarly contributed backing vocals to some of the subsequent &quot;Smile&quot; sessions. In early 1967, Wilson discussed the extent of his personal relationship with Johnston to &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I only know Bruce superficially. [...] I only see him at recording sessions. [...] He&#x27;s a very likeable person.&quot;

Johnston did not participate in most of the 1967 &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; sessions and played on only a few tracks on &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. Reflecting on &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, Johnston said it was &quot;a thousand times better than the [original &quot;Smile&quot;] [...] It&#x27;s just the most underrated album in the whole catalog for me.&quot; He had an unfavorable opinion of the band&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Friends&quot;, calling the songs &quot;wimpy&quot;. The Beach Boys asked touring member Billy Hinsche to permanently replace Johnston in mid-1969, although Hinsche elected to focus on his studies at UCLA and Johnston was not aware of the offer at the time.

Starting with the instrumental &quot;The Nearest Faraway Place&quot; from &quot;20/20&quot; (1969), Johnston&#x27;s original compositions began appearing on the band&#x27;s records. Johnston considered his favorite Beach Boys album to be &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970). In a 1970s interview, he described it as the last true Beach Boys album because, in his belief, it was the last to feature Wilson&#x27;s input and active involvement. He nonetheless regretted the inclusion of his two songs, saying that &quot;Tears in the Morning&quot; was &quot;too pop&quot; and that &quot;I wish I hadn&#x27;t recorded [&#x27;Deirdre&#x27;] with the group.&quot;

&quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (1971) included Johnston&#x27;s most notable written composition for the band, &quot;Disney Girls (1957)&quot;, which was subsequently recorded by, among others, Cass Elliot, Captain &amp; Tennille, Art Garfunkel, Jack Jones, and Doris Day. From a performance standpoint, he later cited 1971 as his favorite year of the group musically because their set lists focused on newer songs. He also criticized &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; as &quot;a hyped-up lie.&quot; His final contribution before departing consisted of backing vocals on their 1972 song &quot;Marcella&quot;.

In 1972, Johnston was dismissed from the band. According to manager Jack Rieley, he fired Johnston at the request of the Wilson brothers. Brian told an interviewer, &quot;All I know is he got into a horrible fight with Jack Rieley. Some dispute, and they got into a horrible fight, and the next day Bruce was gone.&quot; Dennis Wilson said, &quot;There&#x27;s less tension since Bruce left. [...] Musically, we didn&#x27;t click [and] appreciate each other, so one day we both said, &#x27;OK, that&#x27;s it.&#x27; He&#x27;s a good guy but he was writing stuff for a solo album. [...] We&#x27;re a band.&quot; Mike Love stated, &quot;It was very amicable. The Beach Boys never threw him out. He was just on a tangent that was outside The Beach Boys for so many years.&quot; Johnston himself said that he left the band partly due to his unhappiness with Brian&#x27;s creative withdrawal from the group. Later, in 1974, he said that he departed because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to go on singing oldies for the rest of my life&quot; and was &quot;too frustrated being [considered as] a fifth of something – which was what I was with the Beach Boys.&quot;

==Solo career and return to the Beach Boys==
Although he was no longer an official member of the band, Johnston continued to make occasional appearances on their albums from the mid-1970s. Concurrently, he embarked on a solo career. In 1977, he released his third solo album &quot;Going Public&quot;, which included among its tracks Johnston&#x27;s own recording of &quot;I Write the Songs&quot; as well as a disco remake of his 1970 Beach Boys song &quot;Deirdre&quot;. Johnston would also score a hit off the album on the disco charts with a dance-oriented remake of the Chantays&#x27; hit &quot;Pipeline&quot; after the recording was popularized by Manhattan-based underground DJ David Mancuso.

At the end of 1978, Johnston rejoined the Beach Boys at Brian Wilson&#x27;s request to appear on (and co-produce) the album &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot;. The following year he was credited as sole producer on the follow-up LP, &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot;. Johnston has remained with the Beach Boys ever since and was the only member to continue touring with Mike Love as the Beach Boys after the death of Carl Wilson.

Biographer Peter Ames Carlin approached Johnston during the writing of the 2006 book &quot;Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall and Redemption of the Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson&quot;. However, Johnston was reluctant to be interviewed and only offered a few comments via e-mail. According to Carlin, Johnston remarked at one point, &quot;I can tell that you are far deeper into the Beach Boys thing than I will ever be in 100 lifetimes! It&#x27;s only &quot;business&quot; to me.&quot;

Johnston still retains his equal ownership of the band&#x27;s ASCAP publishing company, Wilojarston, and is the only member of the band to have earned a Grammy Award for Song of the Year. As of 2020, Johnston remains the longest-tenured active member of the Beach Boys on tour after Love.

==Other work==
In 1967, Johnston sang on &quot;My World Fell Down&quot;, a minor hit for the Gary Usher-led studio group Sagittarius.

In the mid-1970s, he wrote &quot;I Write the Songs&quot;, which was originally recorded by Captain &amp; Tennille. The song became a &quot;Billboard&quot; number one hit by Barry Manilow, for which Johnston won a Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1977. &quot;I Write the Songs&quot; would go on to be recorded by over two hundred artists, including Frank Sinatra, among others. Regarding the Grammy win, Johnston stated: &quot;How can I get a Grammy for a song that I wrote in my car and The Beach Boys, Brian Wilson and Mike Love have not won? Why is fate being so uncool?&quot;

In 1977, Johnston provided vocal arrangements and sang back-up vocals on Eric Carmen&#x27;s LP &quot;Boats Against the Current&quot; and can be heard on the hit single &quot;She Did It&quot;, with inspiration taken from the 1968 Beach Boys&#x27; hit &quot;Do It Again&quot;. Additionally, during this period Johnston wrote backing vocal arrangements and also sang on the recordings for Elton John including &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;. He also contributed vocals to several songs on Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Wall&quot;, most notably in the song &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, which Roger Waters specifically wrote for Beach Boys-style vocal harmonies.

In 2021, a reconstituted line-up of California Music was formed by Johnston with members of the Beach Boys and their family. Omnivore Recordings released their first album, &quot;California Music Presents Add Some Music&quot;, in April 2021.

Bruce Johnston is one of the producers of The Weeknd&#x27;s album &quot;Dawn FM&quot; (2022), in which he wrote and co-produced &quot;Here We Go... Again&quot; featuring rapper Tyler, the Creator.

==Personal life==
Johnston married Harriet Johnston in 1976 and has four sons: Ozzie, Justin, Ryan, and Max. He described himself as &quot;a real conservative guy&quot; and stated that he had never taken drugs other than alcohol in his life. 

Politically, he identified as a Republican as of 2012. He was subjected to criticism during the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary tour, when a fan video during a meet and greet caught him being critical of then-US President Barack Obama, as well as 2012 Republican Presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.

<text>The Farthest Shore is a fantasy novel by the American author Ursula K. Le Guin, first published by Atheneum in 1972. It is the third book in the series commonly called the Earthsea Cycle. As the next Earthsea novel, &quot;Tehanu&quot;, would not be released until 1990, &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; is sometimes referred to as the final book in the so-called Earthsea trilogy, beginning with &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; and &quot;The Tombs of Atuan.&quot; Decades later, &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; follows the wizard Ged in his final adventure.

&quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; won the 1973 National Book Award in category Children&#x27;s Books. Studio Ghibli&#x27;s animated film &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; was based primarily on this novel.

== Plot ==
An ominous, inexplicable malaise is spreading throughout Earthsea. Magic is losing its power; songs are being forgotten; people and animals are sickening or going mad. Accompanied by Arren, the young Prince of Enlad, the Archmage Ged leaves Roke Island to find the cause. On his boat &quot;Lookfar&quot;, they sail south to Hort Town, where they encounter a drug addled wizard called Hare. They realize that Hare and many others are under the dream-spell of a powerful wizard who promises them life after death at the cost of their magic, their identity, and all names, that is, all reality. Ged and Arren continue southwest to the island of Lorbanery, once famous for its dyed silk, but the magic of dyeing has been lost and the local people are listless and hostile.

Fleeing the stifling despair, Ged and Arren keep on southwest to the furthest islands of the Reaches. Arren is drawn under the influence of the dark wizard, and when Ged is injured by hostile islanders, Arren cannot rouse himself to help. As Ged&#x27;s life ebbs, and they drift into the open ocean, they are saved by the Raft People, nomads who live on great rafts beyond any land. The spreading evil has not yet reached them, and they nurse Ged and Arren back to health. At the midwinter festival, the sickness arrives, and the singers are struck dumb, unable to remember the songs.

The dragon Orm Embar arrives on the wind, and begs Ged to sail to Selidor, the westernmost of all islands, where the dark wizard is destroying the dragons, beings who embody magic. Ged and Arren voyage past the Dragons&#x27; Run south of Selidor, encountering dragons flying about and devouring each other in a state of madness. On Selidor, Orm Embar is waiting for them, but he too has lost the power of speech. After a search, they find the wizard in a house of dragon bones at the western tip of Selidor – the end of the world.

Ged recognises the wizard as Cob, a dark mage whom he defeated many years before. After his defeat, Cob became expert in the dark arts of necromancy, desperate to escape death and live forever. In doing so, he has opened a breach between worlds which is sucking away all life. As Cob paralyzes Ged with the staff of a long-dead mage, Orm Embar impales himself on it, crushing Cob in a final effort. But the undead Cob cannot be killed, and he crawls back to the Dry Land of the dead, pursued by Ged and Arren. In the Dry Land, Ged manages to defeat Cob and closes the breach in the world, but it requires the sacrifice of all his magic power.

They travel even further, crawling over the Mountains of Pain back to the living world, where the eldest dragon Kalessin is waiting. He flies them to Roke, leaving Ged on his childhood home of Gont Island. Arren has fulfilled the centuries-old prediction of the last King of Earthsea: &quot;He shall inherit my throne who has crossed the dark land living and come to the far shores of the day.&quot; Arren will reunite the fractious islands as the future King Lebannen (his true name).

Le Guin originally offered two endings to the story. In one, after Lebannen&#x27;s coronation, Ged sails alone out into the ocean and is never heard from again. In the other, Ged returns to the forest of his home island of Gont. In 1990, seventeen years after the publication of &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;, Le Guin opted for the second ending when she continued the story in &quot;Tehanu&quot;.

==Major characters==
; Cob : A sorcerer whom Ged has met before.
; Ged : Archmage of Roke. Called &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;.
; Kalessin : The eldest dragon.
; Lebannen : Young prince of Enlad. The name means &quot;rowan tree&quot; in the Old Speech. Called &quot;Arren&quot;.
; Orm Embar : A powerful dragon of the West Reach descended from &quot;Orm&quot;.

== Themes ==

===Power and responsibility===

Like both previous books in the trilogy, &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; is a bildungsroman. The story is told mostly from the point of view of Arren, who develops from the boy who stands overawed in front of the masters of Roke, to the man who addresses dragons with confidence on Selidor, and who will eventually become the first King in centuries and unify the world of Earthsea.

Ged has also matured. He is no longer the impetuous boy who had himself opened a crack between the worlds in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, or the supremely confident young man who sailed the Dragon&#x27;s Run and went alone into &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;. Not glory, but necessity alone guides his actions now. Ged will no longer wield magic for the thrill of power or fame or self-righteousness, and tells the impetuous Arren: &quot;do nothing because it seems good to do so; do only that which you must do and which you cannot do in any other way.&quot;

===Confronting one&#x27;s shadow===

In a sense, Cob is Ged&#x27;s alter ego – a Ged who did not turn back from the dangerous road of summoning the dead, which tempted Ged in his youth, but continued to its ultimate conclusion. Thus, Ged&#x27;s final confrontation with Cob and the closing of the hole between the worlds reprises his confrontation with the Shadow in the first book, who was Ged&#x27;s alter ego in a more explicit way. Ged&#x27;s closing of that evil hole, at the cost of completely losing his power (and very nearly his life), can also be considered as fulfilling his wish &quot;to undo the evil&quot; of his own necromantic spell, which as a youth he had expressed to then-Archmage Gensher (and which, as the Archmage told him, he was at the time not capable of achieving).

===Balance===

With a greater understanding of the Balance and Equilibrium that encompasses Earthsea (fundamental parts of Taoism, a philosophy Le Guin encourages in her works), and how life comes from death as much as death comes from life (death itself being a balancing force in the book), Ged is portrayed as a wiser and sager archmage.

==Reception==

Reviewing the novel for a genre audience, Lester del Rey reported that it was &quot;fantasy with a logic of execution that is usually found only in science fiction ... rich in ideas, color and inventions&quot;.

<text>Russell, also known by the Māori name , is a town in the Bay of Islands, in New Zealand&#x27;s far north. It was the first permanent European settlement and seaport in New Zealand. 

==History==


=== Māori settlement ===
Before the arrival of the Europeans, the area now known as Russell was inhabited by Māori because of its pleasant climate and the abundance of food, fish and fertile soil. The settlement was known as Kororāreka, and was located on the coast. The name translates to &#x27;sweet blue penguin&#x27;, after an ailing chief who had eaten a penguin broth remarked or &#x27;the kororā is sweet&#x27;. 

Early European explorers James Cook and Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne remarked, by their arrival in the 18th century, that the area was quite prosperous.

=== Early European settlement ===
When European and American ships began visiting New Zealand in the early 1800s, the indigenous Māori quickly recognised there were great advantages in trading with these strangers, whom they called .
The Bay of Islands offered a safe anchorage and had a large Māori population. To attract ships, Māori began to supply food, timber and prostitution. In exchange, the Māori population traded for firearms, alcohol and other goods of European manufacture.

Kororāreka developed as a result of this trade but soon earned a reputation as a community full of prostitution and without laws. It became known as the &quot;Hell Hole of the Pacific&quot;; European law had no influence and Māori law was seldom enforced within the town&#x27;s area. Fighting on the beach at Kororāreka in March 1830, between northern and southern subtribes () within the Ngāpuhi iwi, became known as the Girls&#x27; War.

On 30 January 1840 at Christ Church, Governor William Hobson read his proclamations (which were the beginnings of the Treaty of Waitangi) in the presence of a number of settlers and the Māori chief Moka Te Kainga-mataa. A document confirming what had happened was signed at this time by around forty witnesses, including Moka, the only Māori signatory. The following week, the treaty proceedings moved across to the western side of the bay to Waitangi.

By this time, Kororāreka was an important mercantile centre and served as a vital resupply port for whaling and sealing operations. When the Colony of New Zealand was founded in that year, Hobson was reluctant to choose Kororāreka as his capital, due to its bad reputation. Instead, he purchased land at Okiato, situated five kilometres to the south, and renamed it Russell in honour of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord John Russell. Hobson soon decided that the move to the Okiato site was a mistake, and Auckland was selected as the new capital not long after.

Kororāreka was part of the Port of Russell, and after Russell (now Okiato) became virtually deserted, Kororāreka gradually came to be known as Russell as well. In January 1844, Governor Robert FitzRoy officially designated Kororāreka as part of the township of Russell. Today, the name Russell applies only to Kororāreka, while the former capital is known either by its original name of Okiato or as Old Russell.

===Catholic mission===

In 1841–42, Jean Baptiste Pompallier established a Roman Catholic mission in Russell, which contained a printing press for the production of Māori-language religious texts. His building, known as Pompallier Mission, remains in the care of Heritage New Zealand.

On 18 November 1844, while at anchor in the Bay of Islands, Mary Davis Wallis described &quot;Kororarika&quot; as a town &quot;which appears small, consisting of a few houses along the shore, and cottages scattered here and there on the slope of the hills behind. Nothing is to be seen back of the town but lofty hills not particularly verdant.&quot;

===Flagstaff War===

The Flagstaff War was touched off in 1845 by the repeated felling and re-erection of the Union Jack on Flagstaff Hill above the town. The town was sacked by Hōne Heke, after diversionary raids drew away the British defenders. The flagstaff was felled for the fourth time at the commencement of the Battle of Kororāreka, and the inhabitants fled aboard British ships, which then shelled and destroyed most of the houses.

Hōne Heke directed his warriors not to interfere with Christ Church and the Pompallier Mission.

=== Twenty-first century ===
In January 2023, the New Zealand Geographic Board proposed that the town&#x27;s name be officially changed back to Kororāreka, its original Māori name.

==Demographics==
Russell covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Russell had a population of 798 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 36 people (4.7%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 96 people (13.7%) since the 2013 census. There were 384 males, 408 females and 3 people of other genders in 408 dwellings. 3.0% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 61.0 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 57 people (7.1%) aged under 15 years, 66 (8.3%) aged 15 to 29, 342 (42.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 330 (41.4%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 84.6% European (Pākehā); 21.8% Māori; 1.5% Pasifika; 1.9% Asian; 1.1% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.3% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 98.5%, Māori language by 4.9%, and other languages by 12.8%. No language could be spoken by 0.8% (e.g. too young to talk). The percentage of people born overseas was 33.1, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 24.4% Christian, 0.4% Hindu, 1.5% Māori religious beliefs, 1.1% Buddhist, 0.8% New Age, 0.4% Jewish, and 0.8% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 62.4%, and 8.6% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 150 (20.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 366 (49.4%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 177 (23.9%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $32,500, compared with $41,500 nationally. 63 people (8.5%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 258 (34.8%) people were employed full-time, 123 (16.6%) were part-time, and 15 (2.0%) were unemployed.

Much of the accommodation in the area consists of holiday homes or tourist accommodation.

===Marae===

The local Kororāreka Marae is a traditional meeting ground of Te Kapotai, a hapū of Ngāpuhi.

==Climate==
Russell experiences a humid subtropical climate.

==Economy==

Russell is now mostly a &quot;bastion of cafés, gift shops and B&amp;Bs&quot;. 

Pompallier Mission, the historic printery/tannery/storehouse of the early Roman Catholic missionaries, is the oldest surviving industrial building in New Zealand, while the town&#x27;s Christ Church is the country&#x27;s oldest surviving Anglican church. The surrounding area also contains many expensive holiday homes, as well as New Zealand&#x27;s most expensive rental accommodation, the Eagles Nest. The photographer Laurence Aberhart lives here.

A car ferry across the Bay of Islands runs between Okiato and Opua, and is the main tourist access to Russell. There is a land connection, but this requires a substantial detour (the ferry route is only 2.3 kilometres, while the land route is 43.5 km).

==Education==

Russell School is a coeducational full primary (years 1–8) school with a roll of as of The school opened in 1892.

<doc id="315902" wikidata="Q1335035" url="?curid=315902" title="Flight level">
<text>In aviation, a flight level (FL) is an aircraft&#x27;s altitude as determined by a pressure altimeter using the International Standard Atmosphere. It is expressed in hundreds of feet or metres. The altimeter setting used is the ISA sea level pressure of 1013 hPa or 29.92 inHg. The actual surface pressure will vary from this at different locations and times. Therefore, by using a standard pressure setting, every aircraft has the same altimeter setting, and vertical clearance can be maintained during cruise flight.
==Background==
Flight levels are used to ensure safe vertical separation between aircraft. Historically, altitude has been measured using an altimeter, essentially a calibrated barometer. An altimeter measures ambient air pressure, which decreases with increasing altitude following the barometric formula. It displays the corresponding altitude. If aircraft altimeters were not calibrated consistently, then two aircraft could be flying at the same altitude even though their altimeters appeared to show that they are at different altitudes. Flight levels require defining altitudes based on a standard altimeter setting. All aircraft operating at flight levels set 1013 hPa or 29.92 inHg. On the descent when descending through the published transition level, the altimeter is set to the local surface pressure, to display the correct altitude above sea level.

== Definition ==
Flight levels are described by a number, which is the nominal altitude, or pressure altitude, in hundreds of feet, and a multiple of 500 ft. Therefore, a pressure altitude of is referred to as &quot;flight level 320&quot;. In metre altitudes the format is Flight Level xx000 metres.

Flight levels are usually designated in writing as &quot;FLxxx&quot;, where &quot;xxx&quot; is a two- or three-digit number indicating the pressure altitude in units of . In radio communications, FL290 would be stated as &quot;flight level two nine(r) zero&quot;.

==Transition altitude==
While use of a standardised pressure setting facilitates separation of aircraft from each other, it does not provide the aircraft&#x27;s actual altitude above sea level. Below the Transition level (which varies worldwide), the altimeter is set to the local altimeter setting, which can be directly compared to the known elevation of the terrain. The pressure setting to achieve this varies with local atmospheric pressure. It is called QNH (&quot;barometric pressure adjusted to sea level&quot;), or &quot;altimeter setting&quot;, the current local value is available from various sources, including air traffic control and the local airport weather frequency or a METAR-issuing station.

The transition altitude (TA) is the altitude above sea level at which aircraft change from the use of local pressure to the use of standard pressure. When operating at or below the TA, aircraft altimeters are usually set to show the altitude above sea level. Above the TA, the aircraft altimeter pressure setting is changed to the standard pressure setting of 1013 hectopascals (equivalent to millibars) or 29.92 inches of mercury, with the aircraft altitude will be stated as a flight level instead of altitude.

In the United States and Canada, the transition altitude is . In Europe, the transition altitude varies and can be as low as . There are discussions to standardize the transition altitude within the Eurocontrol area. In the United Kingdom, different airports have different transition altitudes, between 3000 and 6000 feet.

On 25 November 2004 the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand raised New Zealand&#x27;s transition altitude from and changed the transition level from FL130 to FL150.

The transition level (TL) is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude. The table below shows the transition level according to transition altitude and QNH. When descending below the transition level, the pilot starts to refer to altitude of the aircraft by setting the altimeter to the QNH for the region or airfield.
The transition layer is the airspace between the transition altitude and the transition level.

According to these definitions the transition layer is thick. Aircraft are not normally assigned to fly at the &quot;&#x27;transition level&#x27;&quot; as this would provide inadequate separation from traffic flying on QNH at the transition altitude. Instead, the lowest usable &quot;&#x27;flight level&#x27;&quot; is the transition level plus 500 ft.

However, in some countries, such as Norway for example, the transition level is determined by adding a buffer of minimum (depending on QNH) to the transition altitude. Therefore, aircraft may be flying at both transition level and transition altitude, and still be vertically separated by at least . In those areas the transition layer will be thick, depending on QNH.

In summary, the connection between &quot;transition altitude&quot; (TA), &quot;transition layer&quot; (TLYR), and &quot;transition level&quot; (TL) is

TL = TA + TLYR

==Semicircular/hemispheric rule==
The &quot;semicircular rule&quot; (also known as the &quot;hemispheric rule&quot;) applies, in slightly different version, to IFR flights in the UK inside controlled airspace and generally in the rest of the world.
The standard rule defines an East/West track split:

* Eastbound – Magnetic track 000 to 179° – odd thousands (FL 250, 270, etc.)
* Westbound – Magnetic track 180 to 359° – even thousands (FL 260, 280, etc.)

At FL 290 and above, if Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) are not in use, 4,000 ft intervals are used to separate same-direction aircraft (instead of 2,000 ft intervals below FL 290), and only odd flight levels are assigned, independent of the direction of flight:
* Eastbound – Magnetic track 000 to 179° – odd flight levels (FL 290, 330, 370, etc.)
* Westbound – Magnetic track 180 to 359° – odd flight levels (FL 310, 350, 390, etc.)
Conversely, RVSM equipped aircraft are able to continue separation in 2,000 ft intervals as outlined in the semicircular rules. Both non-RVSM and RVSM equipped aircraft use a separation of 4,000 ft above FL 410. 

Countries where the major airways are oriented north/south (e.g., New Zealand; Italy; Portugal) have semicircular rules that define a North/South rather than an East/West track split.

In Italy, France, Portugal and recently also in Spain (AIP ENR 1.7-3), for example, southbound traffic uses odd flight levels; in New Zealand, southbound traffic uses even flight levels.
In Europe commonly used International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) separation levels are as per the following table:


==Quadrantal rule==
The quadrantal rule is defunct. It was used in the United Kingdom but was abolished in 2015 to bring the UK in line with the semi-circular rule used around the world.

The quadrantal rule applied to IFR flights in the UK both in and outside of controlled airspace except that such aircraft may be flown at a level other than required by this rule if flying in conformity with instructions given by an air traffic control unit, or if complying with notified en-route holding patterns or holding procedures notified in relation to an aerodrome. The rule affected only those aircraft operating under IFR when in level flight &quot;above 3,000 ft above mean sea level, or above the appropriate transition altitude, whichever is the higher&quot;, and when &quot;below FL195&quot; (19,500 ft above the 1013.2 hPa datum in the UK, &quot;or&quot; with the altimeter set according to the system published by the competent authority in relation to the area over which the aircraft is flying if such aircraft is not flying over the UK.)

The rule was non-binding upon flights operating under visual flight rules (VFR).

Minimum vertical separation between two flights abiding by the UK Quadrantal Rule is 500 ft (&quot;note these are in geopotential foot units&quot;). The level to be flown is determined by the magnetic track of the aircraft, as follows:

* Magnetic track 000 to, and including, 089° – odd thousands of feet (FL070, 090, 110 etc.)
* Magnetic track 090 to, and including, 179° – odd thousands plus 500 ft (FL075, 095, 115 etc.)
* Magnetic track 180 to, and including, 269° – even thousands of feet (FL080, 100, 120 etc.)
* Magnetic track 270 to, and including, 359° – even thousands plus 500 ft (FL085, 105, 125 etc.)

==Reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM)==

Reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) reduces the vertical separation between FL290 and FL410. This allows aircraft to safely fly more optimum routes, save fuel and increase airspace capacity by adding new flight levels. Only aircraft that have been certified to meet RVSM standards, with several exclusions, are allowed to fly in RVSM airspace. It was introduced into the UK in March 2001. On 20 January 2002, it entered European airspace. The United States, Canada and Mexico transitioned to RVSM between FL 290 and FL 410 on 20 January 2005, and Africa on 25 September 2008.

* Track 000 to 179° – odd thousands (FL 290, 310, 330, etc.)
* Track 180 to 359° – even thousands (FL 300, 320, 340, etc.)
At FL 410 and above, 4,000 ft intervals are resumed to separate same-direction aircraft and only odd Flight Levels are assigned, depending on the direction of flight:
* Track 000 to 179° – odd flight levels (FL 410, 450, 490, etc.)
* Track 180 to 359° – odd flight levels (FL 430, 470, 510, etc.)

==Metre flight levels==
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has recommended a transition to using the International System of Units since 1979 with a recommendation on using metres (m) for reporting flight levels. China, Mongolia, Russia and many CIS countries have used flight levels specified in metres for years. Aircraft entering these areas normally make a slight climb or descent to adjust for this, although Russia and some CIS countries started using feet above transition altitude and introduced RVSM at the same time on 17 November 2011.

=== Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan ===
The flight levels below apply to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and 6,000 m or below in Turkmenistan (where feet is used for FL210 and above). Flight levels are read as e.g. &quot;flight level 7,500 metres&quot;:
;Track 180 to 359°
*600 m (2,000 ft)
*1,200 m (3,900 ft)
*1,800 m (5,900 ft)
*2,400 m (7,900 ft)
*3,000 m (9,800 ft)
*3,600 m (11,800 ft)
*4,200 m (13,800 ft)
*4,800 m (15,700 ft)
*5,400 m (17,700 ft)
*6,000 m (19,700 ft)
*6,600 m (21,700 ft)
*7,200 m (23,600 ft)
*7,800 m (25,600 ft)
*8,600 m (28,200 ft)
*9,600 m (31,500 ft)
*10,600 m (34,800 ft)
*11,600 m (38,100 ft)
*13,100 m (43,000 ft)
*15,100 m (49,500 ft)
and every 2,000 metres thereafter.

;Track 000 to 179°
*900 m (3,000 ft)
*1,500 m (4,900 ft)
*2,100 m (6,900 ft)
*2,700 m (8,900 ft)
*3,300 m (10,800 ft)
*3,900 m (12,800 ft)
*4,500 m (14,800 ft)
*5,100 m (16,700 ft)
*5,700 m (18,700 ft)
*6,300 m (20,700 ft)
*6,900 m (22,600 ft)
*7,500 m (24,600 ft)

*10,100 m (33,100 ft)
*11,100 m (36,400 ft)
*12,100 m (39,700 ft)
*14,100 m (46,300 ft)
and every 2,000 metres thereafter.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China and Mongolia===
The flight levels below apply to Mongolia and People&#x27;s Republic of China, not including Hong Kong. To distinguish flight levels in feet, flight levels are read without &quot;flight level&quot;, e.g. &quot;one two thousand six hundred metres&quot; or for 12,600 m (Chinese only available in Chinese airspace). To distinguish altitude from flight level, &quot;on standard&quot; or &quot;on QNH&quot; would be added during initial clearance, such as &quot;climb 4,800 metres on standard&quot; or &quot;descent 2,400 metres on QNH 1020&quot;.

RVSM was implemented in China at 16:00 UTC on 21 November 2007, and in Mongolia at 00:01 UTC on 17 November 2011. Aircraft flying in feet according to the table below will have differences between the metric readout of the onboard avionics and ATC cleared flight level; however, the differences will never be more than thirty metres.
;Track 180 to 359°
*600 m (2,000 ft)
*1,200 m (3,900 ft)
*1,800 m (5,900 ft)
*2,400 m (7,900 ft)
*3,000 m (9,800 ft)
*3,600 m (11,800 ft)
*4,200 m (13,800 ft)
*4,800 m (15,700 ft)
*5,400 m (17,700 ft)
*6,000 m (19,700 ft)
*6,600 m (21,700 ft)
*7,200 m (23,600 ft)
*7,800 m (25,600 ft)
*8,400 m (27,600 ft)
*9,200 m (30,100 ft)
*9,800 m (32,100 ft)
*10,400 m (34,100 ft)
*11,000 m (36,100 ft)
*11,600 m (38,100 ft)
*12,200 m (40,100 ft)
*13,100 m (43,000 ft)
*14,300 m (46,900 ft)
and every 1,200 metres thereafter.

;Track 000 to 179°
*900 m (3,000 ft)
*1,500 m (4,900 ft)
*2,100 m (6,900 ft)
*2,700 m (8,900 ft)
*3,300 m (10,800 ft)
*3,900 m (12,800 ft)

*6,300 m (20,700 ft)
*6,900 m (22,600 ft)
*7,500 m (24,600 ft)
*8,100 m (26,600 ft)
*8,900 m (29,100 ft)
*9,500 m (31,100 ft)
*10,100 m (33,100 ft)
*10,700 m (35,100 ft)
*11,300 m (37,100 ft)
*11,900 m (39,100 ft)
*12,500 m (41,100 ft)
*13,700 m (44,900 ft)
*14,900 m (48,900 ft)
and every 1,200 metres thereafter.

==Flight levels in Russian Federation and North Korea==
On 5 September 2011 the government of the Russian Federation issued decree No.743, pertaining to the changes in the rules of use of the country&#x27;s airspace. The new rules came into force on 17 November 2011, introducing a flight level system similar to the one used in the West. RVSM has also been in force since this date.

The following table is true for IFR flights:

;Track 180 to 359°
;Track 000 to 179°

The new system would eliminate the need to perform climbs and descents in order to enter or leave Russian airspace from or to jurisdictions following the Western standard.

From February 2017, Russia is changing to use QNH and Feet below the Transition Level. The first airport to use this is ULLI/St. Petersburg. Most other airports still use QFE.

Unlike Russia, North Korea uses metres below the TL based on QNH.

<doc id="315903" wikidata="Q203843" url="?curid=315903" title="Alfonso García Robles">
<text>Alfonso García Robles (20 March 1911 – 2 September 1991) was a Mexican diplomat and politician who, in conjunction with Sweden&#x27;s Alva Myrdal, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982.

García Robles was born in Zamora, Michoacán, and trained in law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the Institute of Higher International Studies (IHEI) in Paris, France (1936), and The Hague Academy of International Law in the Netherlands (1938) before joining his country&#x27;s foreign service in 1939.
He served as a delegate to the 1945 San Francisco Conference that established the United Nations. 
He was ambassador to Brazil from 1962 to 1964, and was state secretary to the ministry of foreign affairs from 1964 to 1970. In 1971–1975 he served as his country&#x27;s representative to the United Nations before an appointment as foreign minister in 1975–76. He was then appointed Mexico&#x27;s permanent representative to the UN&#x27;s Committee on Disarmament.

García Robles received the Nobel Peace Prize as the driving force behind the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which set up a nuclear-free zone in Latin America and the Caribbean. The agreement was signed in 1967 by most states in the region, though some states took some time to ratify the agreement.

He was admitted to the Colegio Nacional of Mexico in 1972. His name was inscribed on the Wall of Honor of the Palacio Legislativo de San Lázaro, the seat of the Chamber of Deputies, in 2003. His widow died in 2005 aged 83.

<text>Sports in Puerto Rico can be traced from the ceremonial competitions amongst the pre-Columbian Native Americans of the Arawak (Taíno) tribes who inhabited the island to the modern era in which sports activities consist of an organized physical activity or skill carried out with a recreational purpose for competition. One of the sports which the Taíno&#x27;s played was a ball game called &quot;Batey&quot;. The &quot;Batey&quot; was played in U-shaped fields two teams; however, unlike the ball games of the modern era, the winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed.

The Spanish Conquistadores who conquered the island introduced various sports such as horse racing, cockfighting, dominoes and a game similar to &quot;Bowling&quot; called &quot;Boliche&quot;. The Spaniards however did not participate in team sports.

Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as a result of their defeat in the 1898 Spanish–American War. American soldiers who organized games as part of their training introduced the sport of boxing and basketball to the people of Puerto Rico. The sport of baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States.

Puerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation even though it is a territory of the United States. Puerto Rico has participated as such since the 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London. On 2 March 1917, Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the enactment of the Jones–Shafroth Act (Pub.L. 64–368, 39 Stat. 951) and as such Puerto Ricans who resided in the United States mainland were and still are permitted to participate and represent that country in international sports events. However, their achievements representing the United States are part of the intertwined history of sports in the United States and Puerto Rico.

The following is the list and history of the most common sports practiced in Puerto Rico and other countries and of the Puerto Ricans or people of Puerto Rican descent who have excelled in those sports locally and/or in international events as representatives of Puerto Rico or any other country.

==Brief history of sports in Puerto Rico==

===Pre-Columbian era===

The Taínos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and diversional, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the gladiators) and ball playing. The ball game was played in a field, which they called &quot;Batey&quot;, situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a &quot;U&quot;. The ball was made of vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain number of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed. The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas the game was played in the following manner: &quot;One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.&quot; In 1975, archaeologists from the Guaynia Society of Archeology and History at the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, members of the Archeological Society of the Southwest announced the discovery of the ruins of a &quot;Batey&quot; in an area called Tibes, on the outskirts of the city of Ponce. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered under thick forest overgrowth dating back to AD 25 in the area which is now known as &quot;Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes&quot; (The Tibes Indigenoius Ceremonial Center). The site is now a tourist attraction and is open to the public. Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen in a museum on the site and in the Ponce Museum of Art.

===Spanish colonization===
The first Spaniards to inhabit the island were soldiers (Conquistadores), later they were followed by farmers, miners and their families. Team sports were virtually unheard of however, there were other types of competitions and sports in which they participated. The most common sports were horse racing, cockfighting and dominoes. The first horse track was built in San Juan in 1887. One of the most popular sports was &quot;Boliche&quot;. The men would gather in the town plaza and roll a small ball made of wood with the objective of knocking down pins. &quot;Boliche&quot; was similar to bowling. Another popular sport was bullfighting, which was limited to the larger cities of Ponce and San Juan.

===American (United States) colonization===
In the late 19th century &quot;new&quot; sports were introduced in Puerto Rico, after Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American War. Baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States. The sport was also played by the American soldiers who organized games as part of their training. Puerto Ricans were also introduced to the sports of boxing and basketball by the occupying military forces.

==Modern era==

===Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans in the Olympic Games===

Puerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation but because of Puerto Ricans having American citizenship, Puerto Rican athletes have the option of representing Puerto Rico or moving to the United States, living there for 3 previous years or more and then representing that country in the games. Some Puerto Ricans, such as Gigi Fernández in tennis, have won gold medals for the U.S.

The 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London, was a historical one for Puerto Rico because it was the first time that the island would participate as a nation in a major international sporting event. The island&#x27;s delegation consisted of only three members, two of which finished among the ten best in pole vault. In their regional participations, the Puerto Ricans had carried the United States flag into the games. The United States protested, claiming that two nations could not use the same flag at the same time. The decree of Commonwealth on 25 July 1952 would give the Puerto Rican delegation a flag of their own.

In 1980, the United States boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow, Russian SFSR, USSR in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Germán Rieckehoff, who was then the president of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, was against the boycott because he believed that politics should not get involved with sporting events. He was, therefore, denied economic support from the local government. Rieckehoff did however, manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico in boxing, Alberto Mercado, who became the only American citizen to participate in the 1980 Olympics.

In 1982, the Government of Puerto Rico, headed by then governor Carlos Romero Barceló, withheld economic support from the athletic delegation headed to Cuba, where the Central American and Caribbean Games were going to be held. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Rieckehoff, had to appeal directly to the people for donations and were able to send the delegation. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee is also the organization in charge of selecting the Puerto Rican athletes which represent the island in the Pan American Games and the Central American and Caribbean Games.

The Puerto Rican national baseball team won a bronze medal at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, but that medal is not counted among Puerto Rico&#x27;s Olympic medals totals because baseball was only an exhibition sport during those games.

The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the &quot;XV Olympic Winter Games&quot;, was celebrated in Calgary, Alberta, Canada between 13 and 28 February. It was the first Winter Olympics ever held in Canada. It was also the first time that a Puerto Rican team was sent to represent the island in an Olympic ski competition. No Puerto Rican had ever skied in the Olympics. The six-person Puerto Rican ski team was made up of native Puerto Ricans. They were Félix Flechas, Walter Sandza, Kevin Wilson, his sister Mary Pat Wilson and Jason Edelmann. Mary Pat Wilson is Puerto Rico&#x27;s first and only female Olympic skier. Even though the team did not do well in the competition, they were highly respected by their competitors. Since then. Puerto Rico has participated in all but three of the Winter Olympic Games, missing those of 2006, 2010, and 2014.

Kristina Brandi represented Puerto Rico in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. She became the first tennis player representing Puerto Rico to win a singles match in an Olympic when she beat Jelena Kostanić from Croatia (7–5 and 6–1). She lost in the second round to Russian Anastasia Myskina.

At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Monica Puig made Olympic history when she became the first person to win an Olympic gold medal for Puerto Rico by defeating Germany&#x27;s Angelique Kerber in the women&#x27;s singles tennis final. She became the first Puerto Rican female medalist in any sport. On 2 August 2021, Jasmine Camacho-Quinn won Puerto Rico&#x27;s second Olympic Gold Medal. She won the medal in the Women&#x27;s 100m Hurdles in the Olympic games which were celebrated in Tokyo, Japan.

===Olympics medalists===
The following table has a list of Puerto Ricans, including people of Puerto Rican ancestry, who won Olympic medals. &quot;Puerto Rican&quot; is a term also used to describe a resident of the United States who was &quot;born in Puerto Rico or who traces their family ancestry to Puerto Rico.&quot; Not all represented the island, some represented the United States. Puerto Ricans have won a total of 38 Olympic medals, 28 representing the United States and 10 representing Puerto Rico.

===Puerto Rico at the Paralympic Games===
Puerto Rico debuted in the Paralympic Games on 1988. In this event, Isabel Bustamante was awarded the first medals for the delegation, winning one gold and two silver medals in athletics. In the 2000 Summer Paralympics, Alexis Pizarro became the first male athlete to win a medal for Puerto Rico, reaching bronze in athletics. Pizarro repeated this performance in the 2004 Summer Paralympics.

On 20 August 2008, David Bernier awarded the flag of Puerto Rico to Nilda Gómez, who was selected to be the flag bearer in the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Paralympics. Three athletes that registered A-marks attended the ceremony, which also included Alexis Pizarro in athletics and Julio Reguero in sailing. Puerto Rico&#x27;s first medal in this edition of the Paralympics was won by Gómez, who won bronze in rifle shooting. She won bronze in the 10-meter trial, finishing with 489 points.

===Puerto Rico at the Special Olympics===
Puerto Rico&#x27;s Special Olympics program was founded in 1970, since then it has offered services to more than a thousand athletes.

In the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games, Puerto Rico won 57 medals.

Puerto Rico won a total of 34 medals in the 2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games, including 7 gold, 18 silver and 9 bronze medals. Due to the team&#x27;s performance, the Senate of Puerto Rico organized a ceremony where the athletes and trainers received recognitions.

==Distribution and practice among sports==

===American football===

Ron Rivera became the first NFL player of Puerto Rican descent when he played for the Chicago Bears in the 1980s. In 1986, Rivera also became the first NFL player of Puerto Rican descent to win a Super Bowl championship ring.

Others who have played in the NFL are O.J. Santiago of the Atlanta Falcons, Marco Rivera who played for the Dallas Cowboys and who in 2002 became the first Puerto Rican to play in the Pro Bowl as a member of the Green Bay Packers (the first of three appearances) and Glenn Martinez who in 2005 played for the Detroit Lions, Ken Amato who played for the Tennessee Titans and Alvin Pearman who played with the Jacksonville Jaguars are of Puerto Rican descent. Willie Colon who was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 and won Super Bowl XLIII is also of Puerto Rican descent. Aaron Hernandez, formerly of the New England Patriots, was also of Puerto Rican descent. Victor Cruz, another player of Puerto Rican descent, played for the New York Giants and was known for his salsa touchdown dance. While all of these players are of Puerto Rican descent, there has yet to be a Puerto Rican born NFL player.

American Football has been played in the island for many decades, dating back to the installment of American military bases. Puerto Rico currently has 4 football leagues. PR Pee Wee league, for children 8-16, PRHSFL, for high school students, the newly created AFAF, for college students, and PRAFL, a semi-professional league. Although football has been in the island for so many years, it is not widely known. Many things attribute to this, for example lack of proper funding and advertising, lack of high school affiliated teams, both attributing to lack of good coaching. In July 2012, the Puerto Rico American Football Federation became a member of the International Federation of American Football.

Pee Wee Football League
This federation has 4 divisions, with areas in: Baldrich, Parque Central, University Gardens, Parkville, Ft. Buchanan, Carolina, and lastly Caguas. The league is played from January to March at &quot;El Complejo Deportivo Roberto Clemente&quot; in San Juan Saturday mornings. The following is a table with the years and weight distribution for each division:

PRHSFL
This league has 6 Varsity teams and 3 teams at Junior Varsity level. the league is made up of 2 schools, Antilles High School Pirates, and Commonwealth Comets, and four clubs, Carolina Blittz, Bayamón Wolfpack, University Garden Dolphins, and Parque Central Blue Wave.

AFAF
This league was founded in 2009 to rival the PRAFL and to one day be a part of local college athletics. There are four teams, Cataño Gators, San Juan Hurricanes, Carolina Blittz, and Baldrige Falcons.

PRAFL (Puerto Rico American Football League)
A semi-professional league founded in 1985, with 5 teams. The Bayamón Wolfpack, Baldrich 57 Falcons, Carolina Blitzz, Cataño Lancheros, and Fajardo Cariduros.

===Baseball===
====Early history of baseball in Puerto Rico====

During the late 19th century Puerto Rico was to witness the introduction of organized team sports. The game of baseball was first introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States. At first the sport was not well received by the local press and general public, it was looked upon as a silly game. The first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897. They were the Almendares Baseball Club, owned by Francisco Alamo Armas and the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.

According to the daily newspaper &quot;El País&quot;, on 11 January 1898, the first organized baseball game was played in Puerto Rico at the old velodrome which was located at the Pda.15 in Santurce, San Juan. The Borinquen team beat the Almendares with a score of 3 to 0. The first game to go a complete nine innings was played on 30 January 1898 and the Borinquen once again beat the Almendares with a score of 9 to 3.

Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American War. The American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico were permitted to organize a baseball club to play against the local clubs as diversional outlet. On 4 November 1900 the Almendares Baseball Club composed of Puerto Ricans and Cubans beat the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry with a score of 32 to 18. In the early 1920s, teams from Puerto Rico, such as the San Juan Stars, would travel to New York City and play against some of teams there which included teams made up of Puerto Ricans who lived there.

Modern era

====Early history of basketball in Puerto Rico====

Basketball was used by the American soldiers in Puerto Rico as part of their physical training. When the soldiers played basketball, they used a plain straw basket which was cut open at both ends and placed it on the highest end of a pole. For a ball, they used a football and the game was played without any established set of rules.

In 1913, the YMCA of Puerto Rico organized the first game played using the official rules of basketball and in 1916, the YMCA organized the first basketball tournament in Puerto Rico. Teams organized in the other YMCAs in the island participated in the tournament. The first basketball organization in Puerto Rico was the San Juan Basketball League. Río Piedras and Bayamón later followed and formed their own leagues.

Basketball became a popular sport in Puerto Rico, due in part to the BSN, which has been around since the 1930s. During the early 1980s, with many games shown on television, the sport&#x27;s popularity increased. There is also a women&#x27;s professional league, which is affiliated to the BSN.

Boxing competitions amongst the soldiers were open to the public. The first boxing match in Puerto Rico was held on 15 January 1899.

Boxing has, for many years, disputed the top spot for the Puerto Rican fan&#x27;s favorite sport with Baseball and Basketball. Puerto Ricans have distinguished themselves both as amateurs and professionals. In 1917, Nero Chen became the first Puerto Rican professional boxer to gain international recognition. Puerto Rico has also been the site of many championship fights.

====Boxing in the Olympics====

In 1948, boxer Juan Evangelista Venegas earned Puerto Rico&#x27;s first Olympic medal, finishing his participation in London with a bronze medal that year. Subsequently, Puerto Rico has earned five more medals in Olympic boxing, including a silver one by Luis Ortiz in 1984. That silver medal is the only silver medal ever won by any Puerto Rican native at Olympic Games. Although he did not win a medal, Alberto Mercado became, in 1980, the only American citizen to actually participate in the Moscow Olympics.

====Professional boxing====

There are fourteen Puerto Ricans in the International Boxing Hall of Fame, they are Puerto Rico&#x27;s first world champion Sixto Escobar, Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez, Carlos Ortíz, Edwin Rosario, Pedro Montañez, José Chegui Torres, Joe Cortez (referee), Herbert &quot;Cocoa Kid&quot; Hardwick, Felix &quot;Tito&quot; Trinidad, Hector &quot;Macho&quot; Camacho, Mario Rivera Martino (writer), Miguel Cotto and Ivan Calderon. Benítez (The youngest champion in boxing&#x27;s history) as of 23 May 1981, was the youngest three-time world champion after knocking out World Junior Middleweight champion Maurice Hope. Hardwick, was a member of the feared &quot;Black Murderers&#x27; Row&quot;. The late Mario Rivera Martino, served Puerto Rican boxing for more than 50 years as a writer and eventual commissioner.

Other boxers from Puerto Rico which have excelled in the sport include: Carlos De Leon, Ossie Ocasio, Alfredo Escalera, Belinda Laracuente, John Ruiz who made history by becoming boxing&#x27;s first Latin American world Heavyweight champion ever, after beating WBA world champ Evander Holyfield, Alex Sánchez, Samuel Serrano, Amanda Serrano (no relation), Ada Vélez, who is the first Puerto Rican-native Women&#x27;s boxing world champion and Jose Miguel Cotto.

In 2006, Puerto Rican Miguel Santana made boxing history by becoming the fighter who waited the longest after a title bout to have a losing world title bout recognized as a mistake by a major organization. The IBF recognized Santana&#x27;s challenge of IBF Lightweight champion Greg Haugen (who originally beat Santana by an eleventh round technical decision) as erroneous because of a fight-fixing and betting scandal that took place during the era the contest happened, and gave Santana a special recognition.

<text>Mysterio is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #13 (June 1964). In his comic book appearances, Mysterio is the alias of Quentin Beck, a former special effects artist, illusionist and actor who turns to crime. He is one of the superhero Spider-Man&#x27;s most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. He is also a founding member of the supervillain team the Sinister Six, and has fought other heroes, including Daredevil.

The character has been adapted in various media incarnations, including feature films, television series and video games. Jake Gyllenhaal portrayed Mysterio in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019).

==Publication history==
Mysterio was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and first appears in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #13 (June 1964). It was later retconned that the aliens seen in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #2 had been Mysterio and his men in disguise. It was revealed that he had been hired by the Tinkerer to disguise himself as an extraterrestrial and uncover military and industrial secrets. Like the Kingpin, he has crossed over and been a major villain of Daredevil. In the story arc &quot;Guardian Devil&quot;, he crossed into Daredevil&#x27;s territory, almost pushing Daredevil over the edge.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background and first appearances===
Quentin Beck is a special effects master and stunt man working for a major Hollywood studio with dreams of making a name for himself in the film industry. However, he came to see his career in special effects as a dead-end job. His attempts to become an actor were poorly received, but he realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective criminal. In his first battle with Spider-Man, after he frames Spider-Man for robbing the Midtown Museum, Mysterio obstructs the hero&#x27;s spider-sense with gas and dissolves Spider-Man&#x27;s webbing with a chemical abrasive. However Spider-Man tricks Mysterio into revealing he robbed the museum, then Spider-Man revealed he had captured it on tape. Mysterio was then jailed, blaming Spider-Man for his ruined career.

Mysterio later joins the Sinister Six in an attempt at revenge on Spider-Man. In an elaborate scheme, Doctor Octopus gives each member of the Sinister Six a card with the location of the next battle written on it. Each location was carefully selected to best suit that member&#x27;s particular talents and Spider-Man will have to fight them one after the other. Only once Spider-Man has defeated each opponent, will he be able to obtain the card that will identify the next location. Doctor Octopus believed that with this plan, each of the Sinister Six would weaken Spider-Man a little bit more so that his chances would grow slimmer after each battle. When Spider-Man reaches Mysterio, his third opponent, he is immediately attacked by a group of highly developed robot replicas of the X-Men controlled by Mysterio. After successfully defeating the robots and Mysterio, Spider-Man gets the next card that enables him to go on to battle the Sandman.

===Further appearances and decline===

Mysterio later creates the alias of world-renowned psychiatrist Dr. Ludwig Rinehart, using technology and hypnosis in an attempt to make Spider-Man lose his mind, and nearly convincing him to unmask himself, though ironically Spider-Man was helped by J. Jonah Jameson suddenly bursting into the house. Spider-Man then unmasked Mysterio. Mysterio then establishes a brief partnership with the Wizard in a plot to kill Spider-Man and the Human Torch on a Hollywood movie set by pretending to enroll them in a film. However, they were both defeated and arrested. He threatens to destroy the city while on TV, and goes on to convince Spider-Man he is tall using a post-hypnotic suggestion and a miniature funfair, but Spider-Man sees through the illusion and captures Mysterio yet again.

While Beck is incarcerated, his cellmate Daniel Berkhart briefly becomes Mysterio on the original&#x27;s behalf. Out of prison, Beck resumes his Ludwig Rinehart identity to manipulate Spider-Man&#x27;s Aunt May into revealing the whereabouts of a lost fortune hidden in her house. Beck used bogus alien disguises to frighten May Parker into revealing the location of the fortune, but then learned that the money had long ago been eaten by silverfish. In his next appearance, Mysterio tricks Spider-Man into believing that he had caused the death of a bystander. Mysterio then attempts to scare the tenants from an apartment complex in a real estate scam thwarted by the preteen superhero team Power Pack, much to his later humiliation. He is recruited by Doctor Octopus to form the second Sinister Six, and battles Spider-Man. In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man&#x27;s Aunt May, and made deals with demons from Limbo. Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly beaten by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined Doctor Octopus&#x27; Sinister Six on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired. Eventually, he began to lose credibility as a supervillain, with his defeat at the hands of Power Pack being a particularly humiliating moment.

===&quot;Guardian Devil&quot; and death===
After his final imprisonment during the &quot;Guardian Devil&quot; story arc, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a brain tumor and lung cancer, both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live, but this imminent death caused prison psychiatrists to grant him an early release. Obsessed with exacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he was disappointed when he deduced from newspaper articles that the current Spider-Man was just a clone and saw no dignity in overpowering a &quot;copy&quot; of the real thing (even though by then, the clone had been killed and the current Spider-Man was indeed the original). Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on Daredevil, whom he had encountered recently during an insurance scam that the hero had thwarted; Mysterio believed that he had found a &#x27;kindred spirit&#x27; in Daredevil, in the sense that both were s with little reputation outside their homes.

After the Kingpin gave Mysterio all the information he possessed about Daredevil&#x27;s past, Mysterio developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane using a special designed drug to influence Daredevil&#x27;s mood, presenting him with a baby girl and conflicting reports that she was the second coming of Christ or the Antichrist, with the drug rendering Daredevil violent if anyone suggested that the child was innocent. In the course of the scheme, Karen Page was killed by Bullseye after Mysterio had convinced her that she was suffering from HIV due to her time as a porn star, Matt Murdock&#x27;s partner Foggy Nelson was framed for murder after cheating on his current lover, and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell.

However, Daredevil&#x27;s will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and once Doctor Strange discovers and magically removed the drug from Daredevil&#x27;s bloodstream, Daredevil unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain&#x27;s helmet in fury and revealing his now-languishing appearance. Beck had thought Daredevil would kill him upon discovery, which in his eyes, was a &quot;grand way to end his final show&quot;. Daredevil denied him this and instead dismissed Mysterio&#x27;s scheme as a basic &#x27;B-movie&#x27; plot and calling Mysterio a &#x27;human Xerox&#x27;, incapable of having an original thought in his life; if nothing else, the Kingpin had already attempted to drive Daredevil insane and he had used the &#x27;supernatural intruding on our world&#x27; idea in a previous attack on J. Jonah Jameson. Broken in every sense of the word, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from Kraven the Hunter, pulled out a gun and shot himself dead. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, this act was apparently legitimate, as Mysterio literally had nothing left to live for.

===Resurrection===

Sometime later, Quentin Beck suddenly appears in the Midtown High School auditorium in a dark red version of his costume during the three-way battle between Spider-Man and the two successor Mysterios. He confronts Francis Klum before leaving him for Berkhart to deal with. Quentin Beck then confronts Miss Arrow, revealing that half his head is missing from the gunshot wound and explains that, having gone to Hell for suicide, his &quot;superiors&quot; in the afterlife sent him back to Earth to maintain a cosmic balance. His superiors want Spider-Man to continue working at the school and Beck knows Miss Arrow has a similar role for the &quot;other side&quot;. Berkhart and Klum briefly battle one another before Spider-Man captures Berkhart. While trying to escape, Klum runs into Arrow and tries to take her as a hostage, only to be stabbed by one of her stingers. He then teleports away, badly bleeding. Neither Berkhart nor Klum have been seen since. Though Berkhart was incarcerated, Klum&#x27;s status is uncertain. In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #581, a flashback shows that, prior to his suicide, Beck had been hired by Norman Osborn to fake his son Harry&#x27;s death.

Mysterio reappears during &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; story line, which re-introduces several past Spider-Man villains with new twists. This Mysterio claims to be a returned Quentin Beck who had faked his death, though it&#x27;s unclear how this fits in with his aforementioned appearance. He is under the employ of Maggia crime member Carmine, creating androids of various deceased Maggia (including their dead leader Silvermane) to give them a credibility boost in their gang war with Mister Negative. Beck controls the Silvermane robot himself and plants seeds of rebellion in Hammerhead, who had left the Maggia under the belief that Silvermane was deceased. He also tries to drive Spider-Man mad by making him think he&#x27;s accidentally killed several gang members, while trying to convince him that a returned Captain George Stacy, who claims to have always been the gangster known as the Big Man, also faked his death years earlier. This turn makes Spider-Man realize that Mysterio must be behind the recent mysterious return of so many deceased individuals, and he vows to have Mysterio pay for making it personal. Shortly after, Mysterio uses the Silvermane robot to murder Carmine in an attempt to secretly seize control of the Maggia and its fortune. Spider-Man eventually exposes and confronts Mysterio, who flees. He later runs into the Chameleon, who tells him that he has some friends who are &quot;dying&quot; to meet him. The &quot;friends&quot; the Chameleon was talking about happens to be the Kravinoffs. He was present at the ritual where Spider-Man is seemingly sacrificed to revive Kraven the Hunter.

During the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; story line, Mysterio is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains&#x27; team where he is promised that he will receive a reward. Mysterio went after Spider-Man for Menace&#x27;s infant. He manages to trick Spider-Man into giving him the child by projecting an image of Avengers Mansion and uses his illusions to try to frighten Spider-Man. Ultimately, Spider-Man recovers the baby from Mysterio after figuring out the villain&#x27;s involvement. Mysterio is next seen as part of the new Sinister Six organized by Doctor Octopus. He first works with Chameleon to distract Spider-Man and the Future Foundation, faking an attack in the Caribbean by zombie pirates while the rest of the Six steal something from the Fantastic Four&#x27;s headquarters. He also participates in an attack by the Six on the Avengers Academy. When the Sinister Six launch an attack on the Intelligencia and their new doomsday weapon, Mysterio is responsible for taking down the Red Ghost and his Super-Apes.

===Subsequent schemes===
Doctor Octopus and Mysterio later coordinate the Octobots that have infiltrated the Apogee 1 Space Station. When Mysterio notices that some of the Octobots were disabled, Doctor Octopus orders the Octobots to finish their mission and then destroy the space station. Spider-Man, the Human Torch and John Jameson later discover that some of the space station&#x27;s crew members have been taken over by the Octobots, making them Octobot-controlled zombies that obey Doctor Octopus&#x27;s commands. While in their undersea base, Doctor Octopus and Mysterio discover that their Octobot-controlled zombies have passed out. After Apogee 1 Space Station is destroyed and the crew is evacuated by Spider-Man, the Human Torch and John Jameson, Doctor Octopus tells the rest of the Sinister Six that his master plan is about to begin.

Although Mysterio aids Doctor Octopus in his attack against the Avengers and his plan to &quot;heal&quot; the world during the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; story line, he agrees to help Spider-Man, Silver Sable and the Black Widow defeat Doctor Octopus&#x27;s plans after Spider-Man convinces him that Doctor Octopus will not honor any deal he has made with the Six, as he will almost certainly scorch Earth if his plan succeeds. Mysterio leads Spider-Man and his allies to a Mayan temple where Doctor Octopus&#x27;s base is located (claiming that he was responsible for the choice of location due to the supposed Mayan prophecies of the world ending in 2012), leaving them to face the mind-controlled Avengers. After disabling the Octobots that were controlling the Avengers, Mysterio lends Spider-Man and Silver Sable his vehicle and provides them with the location of Dr. Octopus&#x27; base. He then disappears in a cloud of smoke and leaves the heroes to deal with Octavius.

During the &quot;Spider-Men&quot; story line, it is revealed that Mysterio has crossed over to the Ultimate Marvel Universe multiple times. In the first time, he had a police technician set up surveillance equipment to the police department. However, after NYPD&#x27;s police captain Frank Quaid asked the Ultimate version of Spider-Man to aid them to find the crook who was somehow able to stay ahead of his unit. The Ultimate version of Mary Jane Watson, Spider-Man&#x27;s love interest, figured out how the criminal does it after the hero informed her of the situation. After the police arrested his accomplice, the villain vowed to get even with Spider-Man and then escapes. Mysterio appears again in &quot;Ultimate Comics Spider-Man&quot; #1, blasting the Ultimate version of the Kingpin out the window of a skyscraper following the &quot;Ultimatum&quot;. He publicly confesses to Wilson Fisk&#x27;s murder and threatens the city, stating that he is now in charge. He releases a fear hallucinogen across Manhattan to rob the Federal Bank. Spider-Man stops him and Mysterio&#x27;s personal hatred for the web slinger increases. Creating an illusion of the Hulk to lure Spider-Man to him, Mysterio ambushes and severely wounds the hero. Before Mysterio can unmask and kill Spider-Man, a mysterious vigilante rescues him and together they defeat Mysterio, revealing his true face. Mysterio finds Spidey&#x27;s blood on his broken armor and designs a Spider-Slayer that personally targets Peter. Spider-Man defeats it. Before Mysterio can do anything else, the police rush to his hideout which they found by tracking a piece of Mysterio&#x27;s tech. Mysterio curses and proceeds to blow up his hideout. He encounters the mainstream Spider-Man after his last travel. In the struggle, Spider-Man is transported to the Ultimate Universe, where Mysterio reveals that his Ultimate counterpart is simply a robotic avatar controlled remotely. Refusing to allow Spider-Man to escape, Mysterio sends a robot avatar after Peter and the new Spider-Man. Despite using chemical weapons to create the hallucination that both Spider-Men are fighting an army of their greatest foes, Peter&#x27;s greater experience allows him to focus through Mysterio&#x27;s illusions and destroy the avatar. Mysterio subsequently departs, reflecting that it is more appropriate to leave Spider-Man trapped in a world where he is dead, leaving Iron Man to examine his discarded technology. Mysterio is preparing to cement his victory by destroying the portal and trapping Spider-Man in the Ultimate universe forever. But unable to resist the temptation to see how his enemy is faring, he keeps the portal open long enough for Peter and the Ultimates to capture him. Despite his best efforts to throw them off with their worst fears, Mysterio is quickly defeated. Fury decides to keep him prisoner in the Ultimate universe due to his knowledge of Peter&#x27;s secret identity. He is later questioned by the Ultimates when Galactus is accidentally transferred into the Ultimate universe after they determine that Galactus originates from Mysterio&#x27;s world. Beck reveals that Galactus&#x27;s past assaults had been defeated by his world&#x27;s Reed Richards, allowing the Ultimates to send their Reed to Earth-616 to hack his counterpart&#x27;s files on Galactus.

Eight months after the events of &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, Mysterio attacks Parker Industries with the intention of using the company&#x27;s Webware technology to cause mass hysteria by beaming imagery directly into the minds of the product&#x27;s users. The plot is thwarted by Deadpool, who runs Mysterio over with his &quot;Dead-Buggy&quot;. While recovering in the hospital, Beck is visited by an unknown figure, who leaves a Mysterio bust on the supervillain&#x27;s bedside table while declaring that he is &quot;not out of the game yet&quot;. After Deadpool is manipulated into killing Spider-Man, Mysterio tortures the hero&#x27;s Limbo-bound soul by projecting his own spirit into the realm using power provided by a mysterious benefactor. Deadpool is able to enter Limbo and help Spider-Man overpower Mysterio, who is afterward shown to have disappeared from his hospital bed.

===Retirement and return to villainy===
After being beaten by the likes of Deadpool and other superheroes, Quentin Beck left the supervillain business and relocated to Las Vegas. His daughter Misty Beck shows up persuade him to become Mysterio again. Dusk shows some awareness of this, as she warns the Scarlet Spider about Mysterio, but when Reilly visits the villain, he accepts Beck&#x27;s explanation that he has decided to retire. Misty later involves her father in a ritual that would grant her great power if she sacrificed something she truly loved in exchange. But when she attempted to kill Beck, Reilly&#x27;s intervention distracted her long enough for Beck to accidentally stab her resulting in him gaining the power himself as he places his left hand on the altar while shedding Misty&#x27;s blood. Now possessing power drawn from Cyttorak, Beck recreates his Mysterio costume and attacks the Scarlet Spider. The Scarlet Spider defeats his foe by cutting off the hand that touched the altar, taking away Beck&#x27;s power.

Mysterio later created the illusion of an alien invasion that lured every superhero team to fight them. Spider-Man discovered Mysterio&#x27;s plot and defeated him. Mysterio stated that he wanted to become more than a lesser criminal as Spider-Man webbed him up for the police. When in court, Janice Lincoln appeared as Mysterio&#x27;s lawyer as the vision of an unidentified entity with centipedes on him appeared in the courthouse, claiming to be the one who revived Mysterio.

In the pages of &quot;Dead Man Logan,&quot; Miss Sinister coaxes Quentin Beck into becoming Mysterio again in exchange for keeping him safe from Old Man Logan. Miss Sinister informed him that his counterpart tricked Wolverine into killing the X-Men. To take over the world, Miss Sinister and Mysterio side with Neo-HYDRA. Mysterio would later find out that Miss Sinister and Neo-HYDRA would dispose of him once he has served his purpose. This led to Mysterio taking Old Man Logan to Neo-HYDRA&#x27;s base. During the battle between Old Man Logan and Neo-HYDRA, Mysterio used an illusion to make Old Man Logan think that he killed him. Quentin then makes his way back to Bedford Hills Psychiatric Hospital while tossing out his Mysterio costume.

===Dealings with Kindred===
Mysterio is later shown attending a meeting with psychiatrist Dr. Winhorst, where he affirms his old story that he was sent to Hell after his suicide and was released by some demonic entity whose name he fears to say. Dr. Winhorst attempts to convince Beck that he actually faked his suicide and his belief in the demon is just his former illness causing him to hallucinate. But when the demon that brought Beck back to life appears in the psychiatrist&#x27;s office, it affirms that the &quot;demon&quot; is real. When Dr. Winhorst flees, Mysterio begs forgiveness from the entity. Although initially prepared to spare Mysterio, the entity realizes that Peter is somehow witnessing these events in a dream. The entity adopts the temporary alias of Kindred and kills Beck again so that he cannot reveal his identity to Spider-Man before Kindred is ready. However, it is soon established that the &quot;Mysterio&quot; who died was actually Dr. Winhorst, who was brainwashed by Mysterio to believe that he was the supervillain to give Mysterio a chance to escape from Bedford Hills Psychiatric Hospital. Although Kindred is angered that Mysterio shared his real name with Winhorst to increase the reality of the delusion, he notes that Mysterio keeps running from his purpose and gives him a script to stick to.

More recently, Mysterio had begun production on a film with Mary Jane Watson on a remote set he used to torment Spider-Man, to make a play for a girl he wronged while under the alias of Cage McKnight. After being discovered by Mary Jane, they cooperated in the project, but the filming was turned tumultuous by the Savage Six when the Vulture felt insulted by the &quot;unauthorized use&quot; of his person in the film&#x27;s plot. Nevertheless, thanks to an authentic recording of their attack, the movie became a rousing success.

===Sinister War===
In a prelude to the &quot;Sinister War&quot; story line, Mysterio is still in Kindred&#x27;s servitude as he places Mysterio in Doctor Octopus&#x27; latest incarnation of the Sinister Six. Peter and Mary Jane Watson are attending the premiere of MJ&#x27;s new movie which she worked on with Mysterio under the alias of Cage McKnight. Peter is planning to propose to Mary Jane when the movie is over in front of the press and public, but the Savage Six take the opportunity to attack. Mysterio comes to Mary Jane&#x27;s rescue, exposing his identity to Peter and the Savage Six. Doctor Octopus then attacks the theater with Electro, Kraven the Hunter, the Lizard, and the Sandman as Doctor Octopus states to the Vulture that they need Mysterio. Mary Jane confesses to a concerned Peter that she knew who Mysterio was all along and vouches for him. Mysterio tries to tell Peter that he and Mary Jane&#x27;s deal with Mephisto is to blame for everything that is presently happening, but Peter is far too distracted by the warring factions. Doctor Octopus offers Mysterio the opportunity to join the Sinister Six as long as he helps them capture Mary Jane. Mysterio complies and teleports away taking MJ with him while promising her that the &quot;devil will get his due&quot;.

Mary Jane is transported to Mysterio&#x27;s old studios where Beck reveals what happened to him after his suicide, transported to hell, and tortured there until Harry Osborn made him a deal. Taking it, Beck was revived around the time Peter&#x27;s identity was public knowledge, his adventures in the Spider-Men crossover are referenced, and over time Harry stopped communicating with him until recently. Mysterio also reveals to Mary Jane that he was the therapist who helped her come to terms with Harry&#x27;s death, but Mary Jane barely remembers this. Mary Jane pleas with Beck, reminding him he has changed, but Mysterio remains loyal to the deal he struck and tells Mary Jane that he knows what fate awaits him. Mysterio rejoins the teams of villains while leaving Mary Jane to the mercy of Kindred. It is later revealed that Mysterio used his time as Mary Jane&#x27;s therapist to implant false memories of Gwen Stacy confessing to a brief affair with Norman Osborn, thus justifying the existence of Gwen&#x27;s adult children, Gabriel and Sarah (actually clones created by Harry).

Mysterio was among the villains captured by Ultra Living Brain. When Spider-Man defeated the Sinister Six-type Super-Adaptoid, Ultra Living Brain teleported the villains away.

==Powers and abilities==
Quentin Beck does not possess superhuman abilities. He is an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master hypnotist and magician and an amateur chemist and roboticist. He has extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman, allowing him to engage in combat with Spider-Man despite his foe&#x27;s superior physical abilities and using his skills at misdirection as a further method of self-defense.

===Equipment===
Mysterio&#x27;s suit includes many devices to aid him. His helmet is made of one-way plexiglass, meaning he can see out but no one can see in. The helmet also includes an air supply to protect him from his own gases, sonar to navigate within his mist cloak and a holographic projector to create 3D illusions. His boots contain magnetic coil springs which allow him impressive leaps as well as the ability to cling to surfaces. Mysterio&#x27;s costume contains nozzles in the boots and wrists that can release a constant stream of smoke that shields his movements. He can mix other chemicals into this smokescreen for various effects, including a gas that dulls and inhibits Spider-Man&#x27;s spider-sense, a gas that causes paralysis for 30 minutes, an abrasive that eats away Spider-Man&#x27;s webbing, hypnogens that make those around him more susceptible to his will and hallucinogens to cause vivid hallucinations. A combination of the hypnogens and hallucinogens, along with his holographic projectors, are how Mysterio achieves most of his illusions. The costume sometimes also includes offensive weaponry, such as lasers or knockout gas nozzles in the eye emblems on his shoulders, or electric coils within his cape to electrocute those who touch it.

==Other characters named Mysterio==
After Quentin Beck, there have been several other characters who became his successors after taking his mantle as Mysterio. The second Mysterio (Daniel Berkhart) was created by Gerry Conway and Ross Andru and first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #141 (February 1975). The third Mysterio (Francis Klum) was created by Kevin Smith and Terry Dodson, and he first appeared in &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do&quot; #1 (August 2002), and became Mysterio in the final issue of the miniseries. The fourth Mysterio (an unknown man named &quot;Mysterion&quot;) was created by Christopher Yost and David Lopez and first appeared in &quot;Avenging Spider-Man&quot; #22 (June 2013).

===Daniel Berkhart===
After the original Mysterio seemingly dies in prison during an escape attempt, J. Jonah Jameson hires Daniel Berkhart, a stuntman who had previously worked with Beck and Beck&#x27;s cellmate, to torment Spider-Man while claiming to be Mysterio&#x27;s ghost. After he is defeated by Spider-Man, Berkhart explains that Beck had bequeathed some of his equipment to him after his &quot;death&quot;, and he felt he owed it to Beck to get revenge. The story leaves it ambiguous whether there is any truth to Berkhart&#x27;s story or if he was simply covering up Jameson&#x27;s role in the affair. Berkhart is arrested, despite there being no witnesses to his harassing Spider-Man. He tries to force Jameson to get a lawyer for him by threatening to reveal his involvement to the police, a plot thread which is never resolved.

Later, after Beck&#x27;s suicide, someone claiming to be Mysterio appears with the revised Sinister Six, making references to his &quot;death&quot;, stating how after fighting Daredevil he had exited in a &quot;most spectacular fashion&quot;. There was some confusion to this Mysterio&#x27;s identity until the miniseries &quot;Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto&quot; hinted that it was again Daniel Berkhart. This issue was not addressed again until a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured. Berkhart was later confirmed to be this second Mysterio by Quentin Beck. This Mysterio appeared during stories published between the original&#x27;s death and subsequent return.

The Jack O&#x27;Lantern fought by Agent Venom claims to have killed off all of the surviving previous Jack O&#x27;Lanterns, leaving Berkhart&#x27;s status uncertain.

===Francis Klum===
Francis Klum, a mutant with the ability to teleport, was sexually abused by his older brother Garrison (Mr. Brownstone) and forced to use his powers to assist Garrison&#x27;s illegal activity as a heroin dealer. When Garrison dosed the Black Cat with heroin and attempted to rape her, Francis decided to stop his brother&#x27;s cruelty for good, teleporting within and blowing up Garrison&#x27;s body.

Eventually learning the details of Francis&#x27; abusive relationship with Garrison and his role in his brother&#x27;s death, Felicia nearly convinced Francis to turn himself into the authorities; but Spider-Man, believing that Francis was trying to throw Black Cat from the bridge on which they were talking, brutally attacked Klum. Believing that Felicia set him up, he fell from the bridge, teleported in mid-fall and sustained severe physical injuries, losing his left leg below the knee.

Hungry for revenge against Spider-Man, he contacted the Kingpin and purchased the paraphernalia of the currently-deceased Mysterio (Quentin Beck). He reasoned that by using an old enemy&#x27;s costume, he could put Spider-Man off-guard; Spider-Man would assume he knew who he was dealing with until Klum demonstrated his powers and it was too late for the wall-crawler to do anything about it.

However, Klum&#x27;s plans to kill Spider-Man at Midtown High were interrupted when he was stabbed in the chest by school nurse Miss Arrow&#x27;s stingers after an altercation with the other two Mysterios (Quentin Beck having returned from the dead). Klum teleported to safety, although Arrow (who was later revealed to be Ero, a being composed of hundreds of spiders) would later state that her stingers were fatal to anyone except Spider-Man.

Klum later died from his wounds, but was resurrected in a cloned body (with his soul intact) by Ben Reilly alongside other deceased Spider-Man villains, before ultimately dying again soon after.

===Mysterion===
An unknown African American individual purchases the suit of Mysterio from Roderick Kingsley and calls himself Mysterion. He fights the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27;s mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body) and the Punisher. While keeping the Punisher from killing Mysterion, the Superior Spider-Man captures Mysterion and places him in containment with the Sandman, Electro and the Chameleon in his hidden underwater lab. He is later forcibly put under mind control by the Superior Spider-Man and forced to join his Superior Six superhero team. Mysterion escapes with the other members after being freed from the Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s influence.

Mysterion later attacks Liberty Island with an army of robot dinosaurs, which are defeated by Squirrel Girl and other superheroes.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
Quentin Beck / Mysterio appears in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal.

* Introduced in the film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019), this version is a former Stark Industries scientist who developed holographic technology that Tony Stark showcased in the film &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016) and dubbed B.A.R.F. (Binary Augmented Retro-Framing). Angered at Stark for seemingly stealing his invention, Beck was fired for his unstable nature. As a result, he swore revenge and joined forces with other like-minded ex-Stark Industries employees to take advantage of the power vacuum left in the wake of Stark&#x27;s death in the film &quot;&quot; (2019). To this end, they manufactured the Elementals using drones equipped with Beck&#x27;s technology and fabricated a backstory claiming the entities and Beck himself were from another universe. To build up his reputation and legitimize himself as an &quot;Avengers-level&quot; hero, Beck joins forces with an unknowing Talos disguised as Nick Fury and Spider-Man—whose classmates gave Beck the &quot;Mysterio&quot; moniker—to &quot;defeat&quot; the Elementals around the world while bonding with the latter to gain his trust and acquire a device Talos gave him on Stark&#x27;s behalf called E.D.I.T.H. Despite successfully getting it, he learns Spider-Man broke off a holographic projector from one of the drones and reluctantly decides to kill him along with anyone who could potentially reveal his secret. Using a fight in London between his holographic persona and an Elemental Fusion monster as a distraction, Beck attempts to act on this plan, but is foiled when Spider-Man destroys his drones and retrieves E.D.I.T.H. from him. During the fight, Beck is accidentally shot and killed by one of the drones. Unbeknownst to Spider-Man, one of his associates downloaded the drones&#x27; data and doctored the footage to demonize Spider-Man, publicly reveal his identity, and make Beck look like a hero.
* Beck reappears in the film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), portrayed again by Gyllenhaal via archive footage. Though Spider-Man&#x27;s lawyer Matt Murdock convinces law enforcement to drop the murder charges against him, the former and his friends struggle with negative publicity from the press, J. Jonah Jameson, and people who believe Beck was a hero, resulting in Spider-Man seeking Stephen Strange&#x27;s help to make the world forget his identity.
* The full footage of Beck exposing Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity reappears in the web series &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot;, with Gyllenhaal reprising his role via archive footage.
* An alternate universe variant of Beck appears in the &quot;What If...?&quot; episode &quot;What If... the Emergence Destroyed the Earth?&quot;, voiced by Alejandro Saab. Years after the Earth was destroyed during the Emergence, this version spent the intervening decades using Stark Industries technology to build an army of drones called the Iron Federation, gaining control of the Vision to lead them, and utilizing nanites to better control his illusions.

<text>MacDonald &quot;Mac&quot; Gargan is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #19 (December 1964). Mac Gargan is a recurring antagonist of the superhero Peter Parker / Spider-Man. He debuted as a private investigator hired by J. Jonah Jameson to learn how Peter Parker took pictures of Spider-Man. In the following issue, Jameson decided to turn Gargan into a deadly adversary for Spider-Man through a barely-tested procedure, which left Gargan with an irremovable scorpion-themed armor and the predatory instincts of the arachnid. Driven insane by his mutation, Gargan instead turned to a life of crime as the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], and went on to menace both Spider-Man and Jameson, whom he held responsible for his transformation. Since then, having finally removed the armor, Gargan has also served as the third host of the [[Venom (character)|Venom]] symbiote, and a member of the Dark Avengers as Spider-Man, but eventually returned to his Scorpion alias as it kept him alive due to the strain both the neural-armors and symbiote put on his body.

Since his original introduction during the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including feature films, television series, video games, and merchandise. The character made his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), portrayed by Michael Mando. A version of the character appeared in animated form in &quot;Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

===Scorpion===
Mac Gargan was a private investigator initially hired by J. Jonah Jameson to find out how Peter Parker is able to obtain incredible pictures of Spider-Man. Gargan&#x27;s efforts set off Peter&#x27;s spider-sense and the teen easily evades the detective. Jameson then decides to hire Gargan as the subject of a barely-tested process that would endow him with the useful characteristics of a particular animal with the help of Farley Stillwell. Stillwell also outfits him with a club-like mechanical tail. In this case, a scorpion is the base for the purposes of creating a powerful agent capable of defeating Spider-Man as the scorpion is a predator of the spider. The Scorpion proves to be more than a match for Spider-Man, defeating him twice, but the mutagenic treatment seriously affects Gargan&#x27;s mind, driving him insane as the predatory instincts of the scorpion take over. He promptly turns on his benefactor but Spider-Man intervenes, and finally defeats the Scorpion in their third battle. The Scorpion becomes a professional criminal and returns to indulge in a vendetta against Spider-Man and Jameson, only to be defeated again.

He is later hired by a spy ring to follow S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter, but is defeated by Captain America. Scorpion is acquired by Mr. Kline, who creates an android duplicate of him. The real Scorpion and Mr. Hyde launch a campaign of terror against S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, but are defeated by Captain America and Falcon. After being released from prison for good behavior, the Scorpion hunts down Spider-Man and tries drowning him in a cement vat, hoping to use the boost to his reputation to become an underworld boss. Scorpion learns that Spider-Man survived the encounter, and the Jackal gives him the hero&#x27;s location. The Scorpion arrives at a hospital room with Peter Parker and his Aunt May. Not recognizing Spider-Man in his civilian identity, he threatens May and demands to know where Spider-Man is. After she faints, Scorpion rampages through the hospital. A furious Spider-Man beats the Scorpion and makes him apologize to May.

The Scorpion fights Ms. Marvel after a botched revenge attempt against Jameson; the Scorpion becomes more psychotic than usual after this, resulting in his being dumped in acid. In the sewers, his sanity deteriorating, Scorpion comes to believe that his costume cannot be taken off. After a quick encounter, Spider-Man proves that his belief of being a monster is only in his mind. Gargan forms an extortion racket to sabotage the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, but is thwarted by Spider-Man and Captain America. He is freed from prison by agents of Egghead, who wants him to join the third Masters of Evil alongside Whirlwind and Moonstone. The team fight the Avengers but are defeated. Scorpion kidnaps Jameson&#x27;s bride Marla Madison on their wedding day but she is rescued by Spider-Man. Jonah publicly confesses to his role in creating the Scorpion when the Hobgoblin tries to use that secret to blackmail him. Despite his encounters with other foes, Scorpion has always had a special hatred for Spider-Man and Jameson, which extends to when he attempts to become a mercenary for Justin Hammer, who has the Scorpion&#x27;s battlesuit modified. He ruins his prospects on his first mission, to capture a war hero, when he cannot resist creating a hostage situation simply to bring Jameson to him for revenge. In reaction, while Spider-Man in cooperation with the police are dealing with Gargan, Hammer sends Blacklash and Rhino to subdue Gargan and confiscate the tail enhancement equipment for abrogating his contract.

During the &quot;Acts of Vengeance,&quot; he tries to enter Canada to avoid the Super Power Registration Act. The Tinkerer meets him at the airport and provides him with a modified scorpion tail for his costume. He, Asp, Nekra, and Owl are repelled by Alpha Flight and Gamma Flight. He is then hired by the Chameleon to kill a depowered Spider-Man. He is defeated by the Black Cat. The Scorpion&#x27;s constant defeats at the hands of Spider-Man drive him to depression. He wanders the sewers, his mind becoming clearer than it had been since his transformation, and decides to quit being the Scorpion. He encounters a depressed and crisis-ridden Spider-Man. Ignoring Gargan&#x27;s plea that he is a changed man, Spider-Man beats him savagely. In his next appearance, Gargan is back to being psychopathic. He battles and is defeated by Spider-Man&#x27;s clone Ben Reilly.

Scorpion temporarily works for Roxxon and helps them in their phony &quot;rehabilitation therapy&quot;. Roxxon updates the Scorpion&#x27;s powers and costume and promises he will get back at his enemies. Spider-Man convinces Scorpion that he is only being used. Scorpion then turns on Roxxon and is then defeated by Spider-Man. Gargan reappears in the aftermath of the Secret War that was organized by Nick Fury against Latveria. He is among the supervillains who were supplied with enhanced technology by Lucia von Bardas and sent to attack the heroes involved in Fury&#x27;s Secret War. The villains&#x27; technologies are hijacked by von Bardas, supplying her with power, potentially at the cost of the villains&#x27; lives, but the assembled heroes defeat von Bardas and apprehend Scorpion and the others.

===Venom===
Later on, through circumstances yet to be revealed, Norman Osborn reveals Spider-Man&#x27;s true identity to Gargan and gives him orders to kidnap Peter&#x27;s Aunt May should Osborn ever be captured and imprisoned. When Spider-Man defeats Osborn, he is imprisoned and Gargan carries out Osborn&#x27;s orders in kidnapping Aunt May. Gargan eventually summons Peter and tells him the only way he can see his aunt again is to break Norman out of jail. Shortly thereafter, the Venom symbiote approaches Gargan, offering him new abilities, and Gargan becomes bonded with the creature. This would later give him an extra edge as part of Norman Osborn&#x27;s Sinister Twelve. Even with these additional powers he is still swiftly defeated by Spider-Man, as Captain America, Iron Man, Daredevil, Yellowjacket, and the Fantastic Four deal with the rest of the Twelve. Though incarcerated, Gargan is unfazed, as with his new powers come the respect of becoming an &quot;A-list&quot; villain at last.

Alongside Spider-Man and other villains and heroes, Venom is kidnapped by other-dimensional forces. He succeeds in killing Spider-Man, who is really the original Space Phantom in disguise. For his crimes, Medusa orders his execution and almost carries it out herself. Later, he tries to kill the other participants for the Beyonder&#x27;s wish fulfillment prize for the winner, but fails and is returned to Earth alongside the rest of the group.

===Thunderbolts===
Gargan later becomes a member of a sub-group of the Thunderbolts, which has been drafted by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive Secret Avengers and is currently run by the Commission for Superhuman Activities. It is then revealed that he has been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Venom symbiote in check. As a Thunderbolt, he is seen as a hero by the general public and has his own action figures. Gargan displays his new raw power as Venom in a battle with Jack Flag, after pummeling Flag for a bit, the hero manages to stab Gargan, who is protected by the symbiote. Gargan becomes enraged and ferociously man-handles Flag, and is about to eat him when his electrical implants kick in and temporarily subdue him, allowing Flag to live. Gargan expresses fear of the control the symbiote possesses over him, yet he has become addicted to the raw unearthly power it brings to him and cannot even begin to imagine life without it, similar to a drug addict. An attack from Steel Spider and Sepulchre makes him lose control again, briefly becoming a huge monster once more, while Moonstone is incapacitated and thus cannot coordinate control of his electrical implants. Afterwards he returns to a normal form with no ill effects. He also bites off and devours Steel Spider&#x27;s arm during a fight.

Gargan is later ordered by Osborn to hunt down Namor. After shooting him with a Thunderbolts-supplied weapon, Gargan disables Namor by ripping off his feet-wings. The Sub-Mariner manages to render Gargan unconscious and then rips out the symbiote&#x27;s tongue, although the symbiote easily makes a new one. Gargan begins to hallucinate that the symbiote is speaking to him, telling him to &quot;feed (it)&quot;. He later attacks and devours a guard and declares that &quot;the only way out of Thunderbolts Mountain is when I decide to let you die&quot;. It is later revealed that Bluestreak is controlling Gargan&#x27;s actions, although it is uncertain whether the symbiote was actually speaking to him or not. Venom goes up against the Swordsman, who stabs Gargan through the chest, using his powers to force the symbiote away from his sword. Gargan is wounded, but lives. After healing, he retains his monstrous form, rarely returning to his usual size.

===&quot;New Ways to Die&quot;===
Gargan reappears during the &quot;New Ways to Die&quot; story arc of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, no longer possessing the knowledge of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity. Gargan and the Thunderbolts are called back to New York to capture Spider-Man. While on a search for the wall-crawler, Gargan&#x27;s symbiote senses a former host nearby. Gargan suspects that it is Spider-Man but instead finds Eddie Brock at the F.E.A.S.T center (a soup kitchen). The Venom symbiote attempts to leave Gargan to re-bond with Brock, much to Gargan&#x27;s (and Brock&#x27;s) dismay. Upon making contact with Brock, his skin is shown to be caustic to his former symbiote, and as a white substance seeps out of his pores covering his body, Brock uses the Anti-Venom symbiote and battles Gargan. With some help from Spider-Man, Anti-Venom subdues Venom and nearly destroys the symbiote. Norman Osborn uses a sample of Anti-Venom&#x27;s DNA from Mac Gargan and creates a poisonous counter to its healing powers by combining the sample with the immune system of Freak. Mac Gargan is injected with the &quot;cure&quot; and is given a new Scorpion battlesuit, which contains the venom, until the symbiote can recover. Anti-Venom tracks down Gargan at Oscorp. After a grueling battle &quot;Ven-orpion&quot; injects the toxin into Anti-Venom and seemly kills the suit. He then attempts to kill Brock but the symbiote tries holding him back, still feeling love for its former host. The symbiote gains its strength and breaks through the Scorpion suit. Gargan gives up but promises that he will get past this problem and will someday finish Brock.

===&quot;Secret Invasion&quot;===
Gargan was seen being thrown from Thunderbolt Mountain by Captain Marvel. Gargan was later seen with the other Thunderbolts in Washington. The Skrulls attempt to trick him into killing normal humans to find out which of them are Skrulls. Osborn attempted to prevent the symbiote from killing anyone by threatening to kill Mac Gargan and promising to help satisfy his &quot;urges&quot; later, only for Gargan to reveal that the threat he appeared to pose to civilians was a ruse to draw out a disguised Skrull. Venom played a huge part in fighting the Skrulls. He was seen slashing and eating the Skrulls all at once. He soon joins the Thunderbolts and the remaining heroes for the final battle against the Skrulls. During the battle, he was a force to be reckoned with.

Venom, along with most of the Thunderbolts team, attempts to kill partner Songbird on the orders of Osborn. Facing Venom, Songbird was defeated and almost eaten by Venom, but escaped with help from the Swordsman.

===&quot;Dark Reign&quot;===
Norman Osborn forms the Dark Avengers, providing new identities to some of his former Thunderbolts. After feeding a Skrull to a hungry Venom that has become more bestial than human, Osborn gives him a medication that resets the symbiote to the size it was when it possessed Spider-Man originally. Gargan can transform into his larger Venom form at will.

Norman introduces Gargan and the symbiote as &quot;Spider-Man&quot; of the Dark Avengers. During their first mission against Morgana le Fay, Morgana transforms &quot;Venom-Spidey&quot; into a giant, demonic monster who then tries to eat Ares. Venom later coughs up Ares; however, Morgana&#x27;s magic continues to affect Venom, causing him to lose and gain control of himself randomly. After Morgana is defeated in the past by Iron Patriot and Doctor Doom, Mac returned to his &quot;Spider-Man&quot; form with only a slight headache. Hawkeye promised to kill Mac one day for trying to eat him while he was under Morgana&#x27;s control. Once they arrive home, he is seen arguing with Hawkeye.

Later, attempting to find out Norman Osborn&#x27;s plans for his son Harry, the real Spider-Man, with the aid of the Invisible Woman, manages to capture Gargan by using a sonic generator and takes his place to infiltrate the Dark Avengers. Gargan is thrown into the Negative Zone, but is later seen back with the Dark Avengers.

Against Osborn&#x27;s wishes, Gargan is seen heading out into the city to &quot;fight crime&quot; solo. At one point, he is seen defeating a bank robber called General Wolfram. After making out with two girls at once and getting cheered by a large crowd, he takes the robber to an abandoned rooftop and consumes his arm. He then takes the money Wolfram stole and swings away. Gargan is then seen at a strip club with the money and discovers his new favorite stripper. After getting reprimanded by Norman Osborn for eating Wolfram&#x27;s arm, Gargan kills the stripper and places her dead body in J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s bed while he is gone in an attempt to frame him for her murder. At the same time, Redeemer visits the injured General Wolfram and recruits him alongside other villains who have had limbs bitten off by Gargan (namely Dementoid, Doctor Everything, Eleven, and Hippo) in a plan to take down &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (who is believed to be the root of their problem). In another attempt to antagonize Jameson, Gargan instigates a turf war between two rival street gangs, hoping to wear Jameson down through stress and exhaustion from continuously putting out stories to cover the crime wave. At the same time, the Redeemer arms his group with cybernetic limbs to defeat Spider-Man. J. Jonah Jameson goes to Osborn for help and is given Spider-Man to help solve the city&#x27;s gang problem.

Gargan continues to instigate the gang war and aggravate Jameson in person. A bomb threat is placed by Redeemer to lure Spider-Man into an intervention, though Gargan instead devours Hippo and Eleven, badly injures Dementoid, and beats Doctor Everything into submission before turning him over to the police. He then eats Redeemer&#x27;s limbs. With Redeemer, Wolfram, and Dementoid the only ones still remaining of the group (albeit hospitalized), Redeemer sends photos of Gargan&#x27;s actions to Jameson in an attempt to expose him as a cannibalistic psychopath to the world. Jameson first goes to Osborn, who decides to cut Gargan loose by sending Bullseye and Daken (in their old costumes) to kill him. At the Big Apple Festival, the two attack him, with Dementoid, General Wolfram, and both gangs involved in the turf war entering the fray to try to kill Spider-Man. Gargan ends up defeating all of them, and J. Jonah Jameson shoots a gun in the air to stop the fight. As a result, everyone credits Jameson and Spider-Man with successfully working together to stop criminals and save the festival. Gargan later returns to Avengers Tower, where he is visited by Norman Osborn. Osborn informs him that Bullseye and Daken will get over being hurt, but warns Gargan that if he goes out of control again, he will suit up as the Iron Patriot and take care of him personally.

During the opening chapter of &quot;Utopia,&quot; the Dark Avengers are sent into San Francisco to quell the mutant riots and battle any X-Men they can find. Tension is shown to exist between the Avengers and Osborn&#x27;s own Dark X-Men. When Namor and Emma Frost are revealed to be double agents on Cyclops&#x27; side and defect with Cloak and Dagger, an irate Osborn gathers the Dark Avengers and the remaining Dark X-Men, Gargan included, ordering them to bring him Namor&#x27;s head and Emma Frost&#x27;s heart and to make sure that Cyclops sees them do it. The Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men attack Utopia and battle the X-Men, with Venom facing off against Colossus. Due to the sheer number of X-Men, Osborn is forced to retreat when informed that the only way to win would be to kill all the mutants on the island, an option which is not politically viable.

Gargan later begins to show signs that his medications are making him emotionally unstable. On a mission with the Dark Avengers, Osborn takes Gargan off the case when he notices Gargan&#x27;s outbursts. Molecule Man turns Gargan and his symbiote into an inert pile of goo. He is later restored by the Sentry.

===&quot;Siege&quot;===
During the &quot;Siege&quot; storyline, Mac Gargan is with the Dark Avengers when Norman Osborn makes plans to invade Asgard. Mac Gargan and the rest of the Avengers protest. For fighting alongside the Initiative, Osborn promises to give the team their freedom from servitude. As a result, Gargan is among the mass of soldiers to launch an attack on Asgard following Loki&#x27;s setup. He and the rest of the Avengers manage to overwhelm Thor. While fighting Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man after they arrive, Gargan is forcefully removed from the Venom symbiote, which takes over Ms. Marvel until Spider-Man defeats it. He, along with the other Dark Avengers, are arrested after Norman Osborn falls from power.

===Return as Scorpion===
During the &quot;Big Time&quot; storyline, Mac Gargan is seen at the Raft superprison, having been separated from Venom: the symbiote&#x27;s removal was causing medical problems due to the side effects from his original genetic mutation. Alistair Smythe breaks him out of the Raft. Gargan was then fitted with a new Scorpion suit by Smythe, which included a life-support system to stabilize Gargan&#x27;s condition. Smythe convinced Gargan to join him in his plan for revenge on J. Jonah Jameson. Scorpion joins Alistair Smythe, a new villain named Fly-Girl, and some unnamed cyborg minions (each wanting revenge on Jameson) in attacking the launch site of John Jameson&#x27;s latest space mission, where they sabotage the launch and hold John Jameson for ransom.

During the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline, Scorpion is seen guarding one of Doctor Octopus&#x27; facilities. Titanium Man enters it and ends up fighting Scorpion. Titanium Man is defeated by Scorpion despite his best efforts.

During the &quot;Dying Wish&quot; storyline, Scorpion hears the call-to-arms from Peter Parker (while trapped in Doctor Octopus&#x27; dying body) to save him and apprehend Doctor Octopus (occupying Spider-Man&#x27;s body) in order to save his loved ones from Doctor Octopus&#x27; final sinister scheme. Scorpion and Hydro-Man accompany Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus&#x27; body to Stark Industries to look for Tony Stark only to end up in a trap set by Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man&#x27;s body. When finding a safe area containing Spider-Man&#x27;s friends and relatives, Scorpion plans to have his final revenge on J. Jonah Jameson. Upon accessing the memories of Spider-Man loving Aunt May – and the times Scorpion threatened her – Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man&#x27;s body retaliates by punching Scorpion so hard in the jaw (the only unprotected part of his body) that it breaks off from his head.

Scorpion was later seen in the Raft&#x27;s infirmary with Boomerang and Vulture. Scorpion now sported a metal apparatus that replaced his missing jaw. Alistair Smythe&#x27;s mini-Spider-Slayers heal and enhance them, and Smythe gives them an offer to kill Spider-Man. While Boomerang fights Spider-Man, Scorpion is convinced by Smythe to go after Mayor Jameson again.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Scorpion is among the villains at Kingpin&#x27;s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.

In &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel,&quot; Scorpion was secretly hired by Tiberius Stone of Alchemax to further test Alchemax&#x27;s Spider-Slayers during Tiberius&#x27; trip to a foreign country to sell them. During Scorpion&#x27;s test of Alchemax&#x27;s Spider-Slayers, Scorpion encountered Spider-Man 2099. When Scorpion thought that Spider-Man 2099 was his Spider-Man in a different costume, he attacks him with the aid of the Spider-Slayers; Spider-Man 2099 muses that in his time the Scorpion is considered a low-key opponent for Spider-Man, but personally considers the villain a genuine threat after just a few moments fighting him. Spider-Man 2099 was able to use his holographic assistant to project a hologram of Spider-Man over Scorpion causing the Spider-Slayers to attack Scorpion until he turned them off twice.

Scorpion later doubles working for Black Cat&#x27;s gang when he and a man named Lee Price partake in a black market sale that also involved Tombstone&#x27;s gang. When at Black Cat&#x27;s hideout, Scorpion accuses Lee Price of botching up the black market sale which Lee Price denied leading Black Cat to demand an explanation after hearing about some information from her spies at the New York City Police Department telling her what they know. After Lee Price leaves following his explanation, Scorpion becomes suspicious towards Lee. While confiding his suspicions, Mac Gargan dons a new version of the Scorpion armor. He then meets Price at the apartment of a Daily Bugle reporter, who had evidence against Black Cat. When Lee reminds him that they should scare the reporter, Scorpion attacks him causing Lee to transform into Venom and the two begin to fight. During the fight, Scorpion is nearly killed until Spider-Man intervenes, who mistook Venom for Flash Thompson.

In a prelude to the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Scorpion is among the animal-themed characters captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant on Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s behalf. He is among those who Arcade publicly reveals as the Savage Six.

During the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Scorpion was with the Savage Six when they attacked the world premiere of the movie that Mary Jane Watson and Mysterio were in.

During the &quot;Carnage Reigns&quot; storyline, Scorpion joined Agent Gao&#x27;s Cape-Killers.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Scorpion was with the Cape-Killers when they arrived following Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Misty Knight, and Colleen Wing&#x27;s defeat of Bumbler&#x27;s group and Frost Pharaoh&#x27;s group. After an altercation, a call between She-Hulk and Agent Gao mentions that Miles Morales is among the superheroes deputized by Mayor Luke Cage into helping to deal with this gang war causing Miles to work with Scorpion and Gust in investigating Hobgoblin&#x27;s activities in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. While Miles fights Prowler, Scorpion and Gust defeat the Enforcers. Scorpion and Gust later join Miles&#x27; group and Prowler in heading to Hobgoblin&#x27;s hideout. He is among those that fight Hobgoblin&#x27;s superhuman muscle outside. While Scorpion fought Shocker, he asked him when was the last time a Goblin fulfilled a promise to somebody. This was enough to cause Hobgoblin&#x27;s hired muscle to turn against him.

During the &quot;Venom War&quot; storyline, Scorpion runs into the Wild Pack and asks them to help him get out of town amidst the Zombiote invasion. When the Zombiotes attack, Scorpion is turned into a Zombiote.

==Powers and abilities==
=== As Scorpion ===
As the Scorpion, Mac Gargan was given superhuman powers through chemical and radiological treatments, include splicing his genetics with a scorpion&#x27;s DNA, which produced mutagenic effects. As the result, he has arachnid-like powers similar to Spider-Man&#x27;s such as superhuman strength, stamina, and durability, as well as superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes. He can scale walls and also punches holes in walls as a way to climb. He possesses an exceptionally strong grip, reminiscent of a real scorpion&#x27;s pincers. He wears a full-body battlesuit composed of two layers of light steel mesh separated by a thin layer of insulated rubber. In addition to his superhuman physique, he was traditionally armed with a cybernetically-controlled, seven-foot mechanical tail, with a tool steel articulated framework which can whip at 90 miles per hour. The tail has in the past been equipped with projectile weapons, usually an electric generator, although it has also been equipped with a spike at its tip, which can squirt an acidic spray, and a low-density plasma energy projector. The Scorpion can use his tail as an extra leg, or he can coil it behind him to spring himself a distance of at least 30 feet. The Scorpion is substantially stronger and more durable than Spider-Man, though is a much less skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and thus Spider-Man relies on his tactics and wits to defeat him.

=== As Venom ===
With the Venom symbiote, Mac Gargan retains his superhuman abilities, some of which have increased substantially beyond the original levels. The costume can even emulate the tail of Gargan&#x27;s Scorpion costume. It can also be used as a fifth limb. As Venom, Gargan has gained the ability to shoot webbing and climb walls like Spider-Man, and can disguise himself as other people or blend in with his background. He is undetectable by Spider-Man&#x27;s &quot;spider-sense&quot;. His skill as a hand-to-hand combatant has increased due to the influence of the alien symbiote, which has superior instincts and fighting experience. The costume can also heal grave injuries suffered by the host with incredible speed. Mac (as Venom) has claws on his fingers which can be used as weapons to slash his foes. He can also create tendrils to incapacitate his enemies.

When injured or enraged, Venom now has the ability to increase its mass and physical strength to meet whatever threat it is facing with equal force, an ability inconsistently hinted in the past, such as when Venom battled the Juggernaut. During these times it is not clear that Gargan has any control over the symbiote, for had it not been for the technology restraining Venom, he would have eaten Jack Flag. Also, during a battle with the Steel Spider, Gargan attacks innocent bystanders.

=== As Spider-Man ===
A special &quot;medication&quot; provided by Norman Osborn allowed Venom to assume a smaller, more human-looking form similar to when Spider-Man had control of the symbiote. From this form, he is able to switch back to his larger, more feral form whenever he pleases. As Spider-Man, Mac is even more agile than when he was as Venom. He also still has all of Venom&#x27;s powers, minus the claws, tongue, and teeth, which he can regrow at will. His &quot;medication&quot; has also been shown to decrease his will to fight, making him more sympathetic.

=== Return as Scorpion ===
After Smythe breaks him out of the Raft, Gargan is fitted with a new Scorpion suit. The suit is larger than its predecessor, and cybernetically wired into Gargan, making him a cyborg. It is equipped with a more powerful tail, mechanical pincers, and is bulletproof. Smythe also altered Gargan&#x27;s biology, giving him a &quot;scorpion-sense&quot; to match Spider-Man&#x27;s spider-sense. The suit is also very tough, allowing Gargan to withstand a fall at terminal speed. The armor leaves Mac&#x27;s jaw unprotected, which Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man&#x27;s body exploited to punch his jaw clean off. Following his employment by Alchemax, he has gained a new jaw to replace the one he lost.

==Characterization==
===Personality===
Before he assumed the identity of the Scorpion, Mac Gargan was a skilled, if somewhat greedy and unscrupulous, private investigator, who admitted that he would go through anything &quot;just so long as the pay is good!&quot; His greed still motivated him as a supervillain, albeit in a twisted way: while awaiting an official &quot;offer&quot; from the Thunderbolts, Gargan squeezed his agent for financial details on a proposed deal, demanded certain talent for the writing, and, finally, Gargan killed six &quot;capekiller&quot; S.H.I.E.L.D. agents sent to bring him in – because while he intended to cooperate, his agent had told him that the rights to his life story would be &quot;worth a little more&quot; if Gargan &quot;goosed up the body count&quot; before joining the Thunderbolts.

He is emotionally disturbed as a result of the procedure in which he acquired his powers, and retains little of his former rationality. He is typically easily outsmarted by Spider-Man and is not very good at cooperating with other supervillains or following instructions as Justin Hammer learned. His most prominent weakness is his explosive temper and irrational hatred toward J. Jonah Jameson, to the point where he has been known to ignore the orders of whomever he is working for, in order to attack the &quot;Daily Bugle&#x27;s&quot; publisher. None of this has changed with his bonding to the Venom symbiote, or with his new career serving under Norman Osborn with the Thunderbolts or the Dark Avengers: in fact, the symbiote seems to have only made him even more irrational, and his new career as a &quot;hero&quot; has done nothing to curtail his lingering hatred of Jameson. He nearly blew his cover as Spider-Man when he started a drug war and photographs of him engaging in cannibalism wound up in J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s hands, putting his employer Norman Osborn&#x27;s plans and the &quot;heroic&quot; status of his entire Dark Avengers team in jeopardy, just to pursue vengeance against Jameson (now the Mayor of New York) yet again. His ill-conceived and poorly thought-out plan failed, and he was forced to publicly make peace with Jameson in his Spider-Man guise, greatly embarrassing him, though he secretly fantasized about killing Jameson during the whole time while they were shaking hands.

The years of being outsmarted and beaten, despite his physical superiority over Spider-Man, complement the similar hatred possessed by the symbiote, and has allowed it to almost completely control Gargan. Unlike the other Venoms, Mac very seldom refers to himself as &quot;we&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot;. Gargan has even engaged in cannibalism as Venom, severing and devouring the arm of the still-living Steel Spider. After getting &quot;the taste of flesh&quot;, he is seen displaying even more signs of cannibalism such as eating Skrulls, consuming the bones of Swarm, devouring Eleven and the limbs of criminals, and trying to eat Ares. When the symbiote is dormant in his body he has expressed nausea and fear of the organism. Unlike Eddie Brock, any inhibitions Gargan had about harming innocent bystanders has been eliminated with his bonding to the symbiote, most likely because he had such little regard for others to begin with. Gargan&#x27;s previous identity has not been completely degraded. His symbiote once sprouted a scorpion-like tail, although he has not had it since. Also, when he learned there was a new hero calling herself the Scorpion, Gargan-Venom attacked her to protect his trademark while it still lasted. Also, for a brief time, Gargan wore a new Scorpion suit while the symbiote regenerated after Anti-Venom&#x27;s attack, although initially he was hesitant about wearing it alongside the symbiote.

== Reception ==
Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; called Mac Gargan &quot;one of Spidey&#x27;s greatest foes.&quot; David Caballero of &quot;Digital Trends&quot; described Mac Gargan as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s &quot;most interesting villain.&quot; Pierce Lydon of &quot;Newsarama&quot; named Mac Gargan one of the &quot;best Venom hosts of all time from comics.&quot; &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; referred to Mac Gargan as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s &quot;coolest villains,&quot; and one of the &quot;most Iconic Spider-Man villains.&quot; Drew Beaty of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; found Mac Gargan to be one of the &quot;best Marvel legacy villains.&quot; Mark Lynch of &quot;FanSided&quot; described Mac Gargan as a &quot;memorable Venom&quot; and one of the &quot;greatest characters&quot; associated with the vilain. 

Ethan Stewart of &quot;Collider&quot; included Mac Gargan in their &quot;10 Spider-Man Villains Fans Want to See in the MCU&quot; list, saying, &quot;Since 2017, fans have been wondering when Scorpion will fully be brought into live-action.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Mac Gargan 10th in their &quot;Top 25 Spider-Man Villains&quot; list, naming him the &quot;most iconic villain to call himself Scorpion.&quot; Tom Bowen of &quot;Game Rant&quot; ranked Mac Gargan 11th in their &quot;28 Best Spider-Man Villains Of All Time&quot; list.

<text>Bo Lindor Holmberg (17 November 1942 – 11 February 2010), born in Härnösand, Västernorrlands län, Sweden, was a Swedish politician, Governor of Södermanland, and husband of former Minister for Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh.

==Biography==
Holmberg&#x27;s first major political assignment was as a Commissioner of the Västernorrland County Council from 1976 to 1982. In 1982, he was made minister for physical planning and local government in the newly elected Social Democrat Government, and in the following year minister for civil service affairs, on which post he remained until 1988. He then served as a Member of the Parliament for his home constituency of Västernorrland until being appointed Governor of Södermanland on 1 July 1996. His term ended in 2005.

Holmberg was married to Lindh from 1991 until she was assassinated in 2003. They had two sons, David and Filip.

Holmberg died on 11 February 2010 at age 67.

<text>Thermoacoustic engines (sometimes called &quot;TA engines&quot;) are thermoacoustic devices which use high-amplitude sound waves to pump heat from one place to another (this requires work, which is provided by the loudspeaker) or use a heat difference to produce work in the form of sound waves (these waves can then be converted into electrical current the same way as a microphone does).

These devices can be designed to use either a standing wave or a travelling wave. 

Compared to vapor refrigerators, thermoacoustic refrigerators have no coolant and few moving parts (only the loudspeaker), therefore require no dynamic sealing or lubrication.

== History ==
The ability of heat to produce sound was noted by glassblowers centuries ago. 

In the 1850s experiments showed that a temperature differential drove the phenomenon, and that acoustic volume and intensity vary with tube length and bulb size. 

Rijke demonstrated that adding a heated wire screen a quarter of the way up the tube greatly magnified the sound, supplying energy to the air in the tube at its point of greatest pressure. Further experiments showed that cooling the air at its points of minimal pressure produced a similar amplifying effect. A Rijke tube converts heat into acoustic energy, using natural convection.

In about 1887, Lord Rayleigh discussed the possibility of pumping heat with sound. 

In 1969, Rott reopened the topic. Using the Navier-Stokes equations for fluids, he derived equations specific for thermoacoustics. 

Linear thermoacoustic models were developed to form a basic quantitative understanding, and numeric models for computation. 

Swift continued with these equations, deriving expressions for the acoustic power in thermoacoustic devices.

In 1992 a similar thermoacoustic refrigeration device was used on Space Shuttle Discovery.

Orest Symko at University of Utah began a research project in 2005 called &quot;Thermal Acoustic Piezo Energy Conversion&quot; (TAPEC).

Niche applications such as small to medium scale cryogenic applications. Score Ltd. was awarded £2M in March 2007 to research a cooking stove that also delivers electricity and cooling for use in developing countries.

A radioisotope-heated thermoacoustic system was proposed and prototyped for deep space exploration missions by Airbus. The system has slight theoretical advantages over other generator systems like existing thermocouple based systems, or a proposed Stirling engine used in ASRG prototype.

SoundEnergy developed the THEAC system that turns heat, typically waste heat or solar heat into cooling with no other power source. The device uses argon gas. The device amplifies sound created by the waste heat, converts the resulting pressure back into another heat differential and uses a Stirling cycle to produce the cooling effect.

== Operation ==
A thermoacoustic device takes advantages of the fact that in a sound wave parcels of gas adiabatically alternatively compress and expand, and pressure and temperature change simultaneously; when pressure reaches a maximum or minimum, so does the temperature. It basically consists of heat exchangers, a resonator and a stack (on standing wave devices) or regenerator (on travelling wave devices). Depending on the type of engine a driver or loudspeaker might be used to generate sound waves.

In a tube closed at both ends, interference can occur between two waves traveling in opposite directions at certain frequencies. The interference causes resonance and creates a standing wave. The stack consists of small parallel channels. When the stack is placed at a certain location in the resonator having a standing wave, a temperature differential develops across the stack. By placing heat exchangers at each side of the stack, heat can be moved. The opposite is possible as well: a temperature difference across the stack produces a sound wave. The first example is a heat pump, while the second is a prime mover.

=== Heat pump ===
Creating or moving heat from a cold to a warm reservoir requires work. Acoustic power provides this work. The stack creates a pressure drop. Interference between the incoming and reflected acoustic waves is now imperfect. The difference in amplitude causes the standing wave to travel, giving the wave acoustic power.

Heat pumping along a stack in a standing wave device follows the Brayton cycle.

A counter-clockwise Brayton cycle for a refrigerator consists of four processes that affect a parcel of gas between two plates of a stack.

#&quot;Adiabatic compression of the gas.&quot; When a parcel of gas is displaced from its rightmost position to its leftmost position, the parcel is adiabatically compressed, increasing its temperature. At the leftmost position the parcel now has a higher temperature than the warm plate.
#&quot;Isobaric heat transfer.&quot; The parcel&#x27;s higher temperature causes it to transfer heat to the plate at constant pressure, cooling the gas.
#&quot;Adiabatic expansion of the gas.&quot; The gas is displaced back from the leftmost position to the rightmost position. Due to adiabatic expansion the gas cools to a temperature lower than that of the cold plate.
#&quot;Isobaric heat transfer.&quot; The parcel&#x27;s lower temperature causes heat to be transferred from the cold plate to the gas at a constant pressure, returning the parcel&#x27;s temperature to its original value.

Travelling wave devices can be described using the Stirling cycle.

=== Temperature gradient ===
Engines and heat pumps both typically use stacks and heat exchangers. The boundary between a prime mover and heat pump is given by the temperature gradient operator, which is the mean temperature gradient divided by the critical temperature gradient.

:formula_1

The mean temperature gradient is the temperature difference across the stack divided by the length of the stack.

:formula_2

The critical temperature gradient is a value that depends on characteristics of the device such as frequency, cross-sectional area and gas properties.

If the temperature gradient operator exceeds one, the mean temperature gradient is larger than the critical temperature gradient and the stack operates as a prime mover. If the temperature gradient operator is less than one, the mean temperature gradient is smaller than the critical gradient and the stack operates as a heat pump.

=== Theoretical efficiency ===
In thermodynamics the highest achievable efficiency is the Carnot efficiency. The efficiency of thermoacoustic engines can be compared to Carnot efficiency using the temperature gradient operator.

The efficiency of a thermoacoustic engine is given by

:formula_3

The coefficient of performance of a thermoacoustic heat pump is given by

:formula_4

== Practical efficiency ==
The most efficient thermoacoustic devices have an efficiency approaching 40% of the Carnot limit, or about 20% to 30% overall (depending on the heat engine temperatures).

Higher hot-end temperatures may be possible with thermoacoustic devices because they have no moving parts, thus allowing the Carnot efficiency to be higher. This may partially offset their lower efficiency, compared to conventional heat engines, as a percentage of Carnot.

The ideal Stirling cycle, approximated by traveling wave devices, is inherently more efficient than the ideal Brayton cycle, approximated by standing wave devices. However, the narrower pores required to give good thermal contact in a travelling wave device, as compared to a standing wave stack which requires deliberately imperfect thermal contact, also gives rise to greater frictional losses, reducing practical efficiency. The toroidal geometry often used in traveling wave devices, but not required for standing wave devices, can also boost losses due to Gedeon streaming around the loop.

<doc id="315927" wikidata="Q245188" url="?curid=315927" title="Modern architecture">
<text>Modern architecture, also called modernist architecture, was an architectural movement and style that was prominent in the 20th century, between the earlier Art Deco and later postmodern movements. Modern architecture was based upon new and innovative technologies of construction (particularly the use of glass, steel, and concrete); the principle functionalism (i.e. that form should follow function); an embrace of minimalism; and a rejection of ornament.

According to Le Corbusier, the roots of the movement were to be found in the works of Eugène Viollet le duc, while Mies van der Rohe was heavily inspired by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The movement emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after World War II until the 1980s, when it was gradually replaced as the principal style for institutional and corporate buildings by postmodern architecture.

==Origins==

Modern architecture emerged at the end of the 19th century from revolutions in technology, engineering, and building materials, and from a desire to break away from historical architectural styles and invent something that was purely functional and new.

The revolution in materials came first, with the use of cast iron, drywall, plate glass, and reinforced concrete, to build structures that were stronger, lighter, and taller. The cast plate glass process was invented in 1848, allowing the manufacture of very large windows. The Crystal Palace by Joseph Paxton at the Great Exhibition of 1851 was an early example of iron and plate glass construction, followed in 1864 by the first glass and metal curtain wall. These developments together led to the first steel-framed skyscraper, the ten-story Home Insurance Building in Chicago, built in 1884 by William Le Baron Jenney and based on the works of Viollet le Duc.

French industrialist François Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete, that is, concrete strengthened with iron bars, as a technique for constructing buildings. In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four-storey house in the suburbs of Paris. A further important step forward was the invention of the safety elevator by Elisha Otis, first demonstrated at the New York Crystal Palace exposition in 1854, which made tall office and apartment buildings practical. Another important technology for the new architecture was electric light, which greatly reduced the inherent danger of fires caused by gas in the 19th century.

The debut of new materials and techniques inspired architects to break away from the neoclassical and eclectic models that dominated European and American architecture in the late 19th century, most notably eclecticism, Victorian and Edwardian architecture, and the Beaux-Arts architectural style. This break with the past was particularly urged by the architectural theorist and historian Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In his 1872 book &quot;Entretiens sur L&#x27;Architecture&quot;, he urged: &quot;use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its ornament.&quot; This book influenced a generation of architects, including Louis Sullivan, Victor Horta, Hector Guimard, and Antoni Gaudí.

==Early modernism in Europe (1900–1914)==

At the end of the 19th century, a few architects began to challenge the traditional Beaux Arts and Neoclassical styles that dominated architecture in Europe and the United States. The Glasgow School of Art (1896–99) designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, had a façade dominated by large vertical bays of windows. The Art Nouveau style was launched in the 1890s by Victor Horta in Belgium and Hector Guimard in France; it introduced new styles of decoration, based on vegetal and floral forms. In Barcelona, Antonio Gaudi conceived architecture as a form of sculpture; the façade of the Casa Batlló in Barcelona (1904–1907) had no straight lines; it was encrusted with colorful mosaics of stone and ceramic tiles.

Architects also began to experiment with new materials and techniques, which gave them greater freedom to create new forms. In 1903–1904 in Paris Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage began to use reinforced concrete, previously only used for industrial structures, to build apartment buildings. Reinforced concrete, which could be molded into any shape, and which could create enormous spaces without the need of supporting pillars, replaced stone and brick as the primary material for modernist architects. The first concrete apartment buildings by Perret and Sauvage were covered with ceramic tiles, but in 1905 Perret built the first concrete parking garage on 51 rue de Ponthieu in Paris; here the concrete was left bare, and the space between the concrete was filled with glass windows. Henri Sauvage added another construction innovation in an apartment building on Rue Vavin in Paris (1912–1914); the reinforced concrete building was in steps, with each floor set back from the floor below, creating a series of terraces. Between 1910 and 1913, Auguste Perret built the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, a masterpiece of reinforced concrete construction, with Art Deco sculptural bas-reliefs on the façade by Antoine Bourdelle. Because of the concrete construction, no columns blocked the spectator&#x27;s view of the stage.

Otto Wagner, in Vienna, was another pioneer of the new style. In his book &quot;Moderne Architektur&quot; (1895) he had called for a more rationalist style of architecture, based on &quot;modern life&quot;. He designed a stylized ornamental metro station at Karlsplatz in Vienna (1888–89), then an ornamental Art Nouveau residence, Majolika House (1898), before moving to a much more geometric and simplified style, without ornament, in the Austrian Postal Savings Bank (1904–1906). Wagner declared his intention to express the function of the building in its exterior. The reinforced concrete exterior was covered with plaques of marble attached with bolts of polished aluminum. The interior was purely functional and spare, a large open space of steel, glass, and concrete where the only decoration was the structure itself.

The Viennese architect Adolf Loos also began removing any ornament from his buildings. His Steiner House, in Vienna (1910), was an example of what he called rationalist architecture; it had a simple stucco rectangular façade with square windows and no ornament. The fame of the new movement, which became known as the Vienna Secession spread beyond Austria. Josef Hoffmann, a student of Wagner, constructed a landmark of early modernist architecture, the Stoclet Palace, in Brussels, in 1906–1911. This residence, built of brick covered with Norwegian marble, was composed of geometric blocks, wings, and a tower. A large pool in front of the house reflected its cubic forms. The interior was decorated with paintings by Gustav Klimt and other artists, and the architect even designed clothing for the family to match the architecture.

In Germany, a modernist industrial movement, &quot;Deutscher Werkbund&quot; (German Work Federation) had been created in Munich in 1907 by Hermann Muthesius, a prominent architectural commentator. Its goal was to bring together designers and industrialists, to turn out well-designed, high-quality products, and in the process to invent a new type of architecture. The organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms, but quickly expanded. The architects include Peter Behrens, Theodor Fischer (who served as its first president), Josef Hoffmann and Richard Riemerschmid. In 1909 Behrens designed one of the earliest and most influential industrial buildings in the modernist style, the AEG turbine factory, a functional monument of steel and concrete. In 1911–1913, Adolf Meyer and Walter Gropius, who had both worked for Behrens, built another revolutionary industrial plant, the Fagus Factory in Alfeld an der Laine, a building without ornament where every construction element was on display. The &quot;Werkbund&quot; organized a major exposition of modernist design in Cologne just a few weeks before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. For the 1914 Cologne exhibition, Bruno Taut built a revolutionary glass pavilion.

==Early American modernism (1890s–1914)==
Frank Lloyd Wright was a highly original and independent American architect who refused to be categorized in any one architectural movement. Like Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, he had no formal architectural training. From 1887 to 1893 he worked in the Chicago office of Louis Sullivan, who pioneered the first tall steel-frame office buildings in Chicago, and who famously stated &quot;form follows function&quot;. Wright set out to break all the traditional rules. He was particularly famous for his Prairie Houses, including the Winslow House in River Forest, Illinois (1893–94); Arthur Heurtley House (1902) and Robie House (1909); sprawling, geometric residences without decoration, with strong horizontal lines which seemed to grow out of the earth, and which echoed the wide flat spaces of the American prairie. His Larkin Building (1904–1906) in Buffalo, New York, Unity Temple (1905) in Oak Park, Illinois and Unity Temple had highly original forms and no connection with historical precedents.

===Early skyscrapers===
At the end of the 19th century, the first skyscrapers began to appear in the United States. They were a response to the shortage of land and high cost of real estate in the center of the fast-growing American cities, and the availability of new technologies, including fireproof steel frames and improvements in the safety elevator invented by Elisha Otis in 1852. The first steel-framed &quot;skyscraper&quot;, The Home Insurance Building in Chicago, was ten stories high. It was designed by William Le Baron Jenney in 1883, and was briefly the tallest building in the world. Louis Sullivan built another monumental new structure, the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building, in the heart of Chicago in 1904–1906. While these buildings were revolutionary in their steel frames and height, their decoration was borrowed from Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Gothic and Beaux-Arts architecture. The Woolworth Building, designed by Cass Gilbert, was completed in 1912, and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in 1929. The structure was purely modern, but its exterior was decorated with Neo-Gothic ornament, complete with decorative buttresses, arches and spires, which caused it to be nicknamed the &quot;Cathedral of Commerce&quot;.

==Rise of modernism in Europe and Russia (1918–1931)==

After the first World War, a prolonged struggle began between architects who favored the more traditional styles of neo-classicism and the Beaux-Arts architecture style, and the modernists, led by Le Corbusier and Robert Mallet-Stevens in France, Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Germany, and Konstantin Melnikov in the new Soviet Union, who wanted only pure forms and the elimination of any decoration. Louis Sullivan popularized the axiom &quot;Form follows function&quot; to emphasize the importance of utilitarian simplicity in modern architecture. Art Deco architects such as Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage often made a compromise between the two, combining modernist forms and stylized decoration.

===International Style (1920s–1970s)===

The dominant figure in the rise of modernism in France was Charles-Édouard Jeanerette, a Swiss-French architect who in 1920 took the name Le Corbusier. In 1920 he co-founded a journal called &quot;″L&#x27;Espirit Nouveau&quot; and energetically promoted architecture that was functional, pure, and free of any decoration or historical associations. He was also a passionate advocate of a new urbanism, based on planned cities. In 1922 he presented a design of a city for three million people, whose inhabitants lived in identical sixty-story tall skyscrapers surrounded by open parkland. He designed modular houses, which would be mass-produced on the same plan and assembled into apartment blocks, neighborhoods, and cities. In 1923 he published &quot;Toward an Architecture&quot;, with his famous slogan, &quot;a house is a machine for living in.&quot; He tirelessly promoted his ideas through slogans, articles, books, conferences, and participation in Expositions.

To illustrate his ideas, in the 1920s he built a series of houses and villas in and around Paris. They were all built according to a common system, based upon the use of reinforced concrete, and of reinforced concrete pylons in the interior which supported the structure, allowing glass curtain walls on the façade and open floor plans, independent of the structure. They were always white, and had no ornament or decoration on the outside or inside. The best-known of these houses was the Villa Savoye, built in 1928–1931 in the Paris suburb of Poissy. An elegant white box wrapped with a ribbon of glass windows around on the façade, with living space that opened upon an interior garden and countryside around, raised up by a row of white pylons in the center of a large lawn, it became an icon of modernist architecture.

===Bauhaus and the German Werkbund (1919–1933)===
In Germany, two important modernist movements appeared after the first World War, The Bauhaus was a school founded in Weimar in 1919 under the direction of Walter Gropius. Gropius was the son of the official state architect of Berlin, who studied before the war with Peter Behrens, and designed the modernist Fagus turbine factory. The Bauhaus was a fusion of the prewar Academy of Arts and the school of technology. In 1926 it was transferred from Weimar to Dessau; Gropius designed the new school and student dormitories in the new, purely functional modernist style he was encouraging. The school brought together modernists in all fields; the faculty included the modernist painters Vasily Kandinsky, Joseph Albers and Paul Klee, and the designer Marcel Breuer.

Gropius became an important theorist of modernism, writing &quot;The Idea and Construction&quot; in 1923. He was an advocate of standardization in architecture, and the mass construction of rationally designed apartment blocks for factory workers. In 1928 he was commissioned by the Siemens company to build apartment for workers in the suburbs of Berlin, and in 1929 he proposed the construction of clusters of slender eight- to ten-story high-rise apartment towers for workers.

While Gropius was active at the Bauhaus, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe led the modernist architectural movement in Berlin. Inspired by the De Stijl movement in the Netherlands, he built clusters of concrete summer houses and proposed a project for a glass office tower. He became the vice president of the German Werkbund, and became the head of the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1933. proposing a wide variety of modernist plans for urban reconstruction. His most famous modernist work was the German pavilion for the 1929 international exposition in Barcelona. It was a work of pure modernism, with glass and concrete walls and clean, horizontal lines. Though it was only a temporary structure, and was torn down in 1930, it became, along with Le Corbusier&#x27;s Villa Savoye, one of the best-known landmarks of modernist architecture. A reconstructed version now stands on the original site in Barcelona.

When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they viewed the Bauhaus as a training ground for communists, and closed the school in 1933. Gropius left Germany and went to England, then to the United States, where he and Marcel Breuer both joined the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and became the teachers of a generation of American postwar architects. In 1937 Mies van der Rohe also moved to the United States; he became one of the most famous designers of postwar American skyscrapers.

===Expressionist architecture (1918–1931)===

Expressionism, which appeared in Germany between 1910 and 1925, was a counter-movement against the strictly functional architecture of the Bauhaus and Werkbund. Its advocates, including Bruno Taut, Hans Poelzig, Fritz Hoger and Erich Mendelsohn, wanted to create architecture that was poetic, expressive, and optimistic. Many expressionist architects had fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the German Revolution of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda. Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s, As result, many of the most innovative expressionist projects, including Bruno Taut&#x27;s &quot;Alpine Architecture&quot; and Hermann Finsterlin&#x27;s &quot;Formspiels&quot;, remained on paper. Scenography for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination, and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate. A particular type, using bricks to create its forms (rather than concrete) is known as Brick Expressionism.

Erich Mendelsohn, (who disliked the term Expressionism for his work) began his career designing churches, silos, and factories which were highly imaginative, but, for lack of resources, were never built. In 1920, he finally was able to construct one of his works in the city of Potsdam; an observatory and research center called the Einsteinium, named in tribute to Albert Einstein. It was supposed to be built of reinforced concrete, but because of technical problems it was finally built of traditional materials covered with plaster. His sculptural form, very different from the austere rectangular forms of the Bauhaus, first won him commissions to build movie theaters and retail stores in Stuttgart, Nuremberg, and Berlin. His Mossehaus in Berlin was an early model for the streamline moderne style. His Columbushaus on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin (1931) was a prototype for the modernist office buildings that followed. (It was torn down in 1957, because it stood in the zone between East and West Berlin, where the Berlin Wall was constructed.) Following the rise of the Nazis to power, he moved to England (1933), then to the United States (1941).

Fritz Höger was another notable Expressionist architect of the period. His Chilehaus was built as the headquarters of a shipping company, and was modeled after a giant steamship, a triangular building with a sharply pointed bow. It was constructed of dark brick, and used external piers to express its vertical structure. Its external decoration borrowed from Gothic cathedrals, as did its internal arcades. Hans Poelzig was another notable expressionist architect. In 1919 he built the Großes Schauspielhaus, an immense theater in Berlin, seating five thousand spectators for theater impresario Max Reinhardt. It featured elongated shapes like stalagmites hanging down from its gigantic dome, and lights on massive columns in its foyer. He also constructed the IG Farben building, a massive corporate headquarters, now the main building of Goethe University in Frankfurt. Bruno Taut specialized in building large-scale apartment complexes for working-class Berliners. He built twelve thousand individual units, sometimes in buildings with unusual shapes, such as a giant horseshoe. Unlike most other modernists, he used bright exterior colors to give his buildings more life The use of dark brick in the German projects gave that particular style a name, Brick Expressionism.

The Austrian philosopher, architect, and social critic Rudolf Steiner also departed as far as possible from traditional architectural forms. His Second Goetheanum, built from 1926 near Basel, Switzerland and Mendelsohn&#x27;s Einsteinturm in Potsdam, Germany, were based on no traditional models and had entirely original shapes.

===Constructivist architecture (1919–1931)===
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Russian avant-garde artists and architects began searching for a new Soviet style which could replace traditional neoclassicism. The new architectural movements were closely tied with the literary and artistic movements of the period, the futurism of poet Vladimir Mayakovskiy, the Suprematism of painter Kasimir Malevich, and the colorful Rayonism of painter Mikhail Larionov. The most startling design that emerged was the tower proposed by painter and sculptor Vladimir Tatlin for the Moscow meeting of the Third Communist International in 1920: he proposed two interlaced towers of metal four hundred meters high, with four geometric volumes suspended from cables. The movement of Russian Constructivist architecture was launched in 1921 by a group of artists led by Aleksandr Rodchenko. Their manifesto proclaimed that their goal was to find the &quot;communist expression of material structures&quot;. Soviet architects began to construct workers&#x27; clubs, communal apartment houses, and communal kitchens for feeding whole neighborhoods.

One of the first prominent constructivist architects to emerge in Moscow was Konstantin Melnikov, the number of working clubs – including Rusakov Workers&#x27; Club (1928) – and his own living house, Melnikov House (1929) near Arbat Street in Moscow. Melnikov traveled to Paris in 1925 where he built the Soviet Pavilion for the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925; it was a highly geometric vertical construction of glass and steel crossed by a diagonal stairway, and crowned with a hammer and sickle. The leading group of constructivist architects, led by Vesnin brothers and Moisei Ginzburg, was publishing the &#x27;Contemporary Architecture&#x27; journal. This group created several major constructivist projects in the wake of the First Five Year Plan – including colossal Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (1932) – and made an attempt to start the standardization of living blocks with Ginzburg&#x27;s Narkomfin building. A number of architects from the pre-Soviet period also took up the constructivist style. The most famous example was Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum in Moscow (1924), by Alexey Shchusev (1924)

The main centers of constructivist architecture were Moscow and Leningrad; however, during the industrialization many constructivist buildings were erected in provincial cities. The regional industrial centers, including Ekaterinburg, Kharkiv or Ivanovo, were rebuilt in the constructivist manner; some cities, like Magnitogorsk or Zaporizhzhia, were constructed anew (the so-called &quot;socgorod&quot;, or &#x27;socialist city&#x27;).

The style fell markedly out of favor in the 1930s, replaced by the more grandiose nationalist styles that Stalin favored. Constructivist architects and even Le Corbusier projects for the new Palace of the Soviets from 1931 to 1933, but the winner was an early Stalinist building in the style termed Postconstructivism. The last major Russian constructivist building, by Boris Iofan, was built for the Paris World Exhibition (1937), where it faced the pavilion of Nazi Germany by Hitler&#x27;s architect Albert Speer.

===New Objectivity (1920–1933) ===
The New Objectivity (in German Neue Sachlichkeit, sometimes also translated as New Sobriety) is a name often given to the Modern architecture that emerged in Europe, primarily German-speaking Europe, in the 1920s and 30s. It is also frequently called Neues Bauen (New Building). The New Objectivity took place in many German cities in that period, for example in Frankfurt with its Neues Frankfurt project.

===Modernism becomes a movement: CIAM (1928)===

By the late 1920s, modernism had become an important movement in Europe. Architecture, which previously had been predominantly national, began to become international. The architects traveled, met each other, and shared ideas. Several modernists, including Le Corbusier, had participated in the competition for the headquarters of the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the Weissenhof Estate Stuttgart. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses; Le Corbusier, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau, and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style. The first meeting of the &quot;Congrès Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne&quot; or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a chateau on Lake Leman in Switzerland 26–28 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Auguste Perret, Pierre Chareau and Tony Garnier from France; Victor Bourgeois from Belgium; Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn, Ernst May and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from Germany; Josef Frank from Austria; Mart Stam and Gerrit Rietveld from the Netherlands, and Adolf Loos from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included Josep Lluís Sert of Spain and Alvar Aalto of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic &quot;Rational methods for groups of habitations&quot;. A third meeting, on &quot;The functional city&quot;, was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead, the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized. The text, called The Athens Charter, after considerable editing by Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1957 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.

==Art Deco==
The Art Deco architectural style (called &quot;Style Moderne&quot; in France), was modern, but it was not modernist; it had many features of modernism, including the use of reinforced concrete, glass, steel, chrome, and it rejected traditional historical models, such as the Beaux-Arts style and Neo-classicism; but, unlike the modernist styles of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, it made lavish use of decoration and color. It reveled in the symbols of modernity; lightning flashes, sunrises, and zig-zags. Art Deco had begun in France before World War I and spread through Europe; in the 1920s and 1930s it became a highly popular style in the United States, South America, India, China, Australia, and Japan. In Europe, Art Deco was particularly popular for department stores and movie theaters. The style reached its peak in Europe at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925, which featured art deco pavilions and decoration from twenty countries. Only two pavilions were purely modernist; the Esprit Nouveau pavilion of Le Corbusier, which represented his idea for a mass-produced housing unit, and the pavilion of the USSR, by Konstantin Melnikov in a flamboyantly futurist style.

Later French landmarks in the Art Deco style included the Grand Rex movie theater in Paris, La Samaritaine department store by Henri Sauvage (1926–28) and the Social and Economic Council building in Paris (1937–38) by Auguste Perret, and the Palais de Tokyo and Palais de Chaillot, both built by collectives of architects for the 1937 Paris .

===American Art Deco; the skyscraper style (1919–1939)===
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an exuberant American variant of Art Deco appeared in the Chrysler Building, Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center in New York City, and Guardian Building in Detroit. The first skyscrapers in Chicago and New York had been designed in a neo-gothic or neoclassical style, but these buildings were very different; they combined modern materials and technology (stainless steel, concrete, aluminum, chrome-plated steel) with Art Deco geometry; stylized zig-zags, lightning flashes, fountains, sunrises, and, at the top of the Chrysler building, Art Deco &quot;gargoyles&quot; in the form of stainless steel radiator ornaments. The interiors of these new buildings, sometimes termed Cathedrals of Commerce&quot;, were lavishly decorated in bright contrasting colors, with geometric patterns variously influenced by Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, African textile patterns, and European cathedrals, Frank Lloyd Wright himself experimented with Mayan Revival, in the concrete cube-based Ennis House of 1924 in Los Angeles. The style appeared in the late 1920s and 1930s in all major American cities. The style was used most often in office buildings, but it also appeared in the enormous movie palaces that were built in large cities when sound films were introduced.

===Streamline style and Public Works Administration (1933–1939)===

The beginning of the Great Depression in 1929 brought an end to lavishly decorated Art Deco architecture and a temporary halt to the construction of new skyscrapers. It also brought in a new style, called &quot;Streamline Moderne&quot; or sometimes just Streamline. This style, sometimes modeled after for the form of ocean liners, featured rounded corners, strong horizontal lines, and often nautical features, such as superstructures and steel railings. It was associated with modernity and especially with transportation; the style was often used for new airport terminals, train and bus stations, and for gas stations and diners built along the growing American highway system. In the 1930s the style was used not only in buildings, but in railroad locomotives, and even refrigerators and vacuum cleaners. It both borrowed from industrial design and influenced it.

In the United States, the Great Depression led to a new style for government buildings, sometimes called PWA Moderne, for the Public Works Administration, which launched gigantic construction programs in the U.S. to stimulate employment. It was essentially classical architecture stripped of ornament, and was employed in state and federal buildings, from post offices to the largest office building in the world at that time, Pentagon (1941–43), begun just before the United States entered the Second World War.

==American modernism (1919–1939)==

During the 1920s and 1930s, Frank Lloyd Wright resolutely refused to associate himself with any architectural movements. He considered his architecture to be entirely unique and his own. Between 1916 and 1922, he broke away from his earlier prairie house style and worked instead on houses decorated with textured blocks of cement; this became known as his &quot;Mayan style&quot;, after the pyramids of the ancient Mayan civilization. He experimented for a time with modular mass-produced housing. He identified his architecture as &quot;Usonian&quot;, a combination of USA, &quot;utopian&quot; and &quot;organic social order&quot;. His business was severely affected by the beginning of the Great Depression that began in 1929; he had fewer wealthy clients who wanted to experiment. Between 1928 and 1935, he built only two buildings: a hotel near Chandler, Arizona, and the most famous of all his residences, Fallingwater (1934–37), a vacation house in Pennsylvania for Edgar J. Kaufman. Fallingwater is a remarkable structure of concrete slabs suspended over a waterfall, perfectly uniting architecture and nature.

The Austrian architect Rudolph Schindler designed what could be called the first house in the modern style in 1922, the Schindler house. 
Schindler also contributed to American modernism with his design for the Lovell Beach House in Newport Beach. The Austrian architect Richard Neutra moved to the United States in 1923, worked for a short time with Frank Lloyd Wright, also quickly became a force in American architecture through his modernist design for the same client, the Lovell Health House in Los Angeles. Neutra&#x27;s most notable architectural work was the Kaufmann Desert House in 1946, and he designed hundreds of further projects.

==Paris International Exposition of 1937 and the architecture of dictators==
The 1937 Paris International Exposition in Paris effectively marked the end of the Art Deco, and of pre-war architectural styles. Most of the pavilions were in a neoclassical Deco style, with colonnades and sculptural decoration. The pavilions of Nazi Germany, designed by Albert Speer, in a German neoclassical style topped by eagle and swastika, faced the pavilion of the Soviet Union, topped by enormous statues of a worker and a peasant carrying a hammer and sickle. As to the modernists, Le Corbusier was practically, but not quite invisible at the Exposition; he participated in the Pavilion des temps nouveaux, but focused mainly on his painting. The one modernist who did attract attention was a collaborator of Le Corbusier, Josep Lluis Sert, the Spanish architect, whose pavilion of the Second Spanish Republic was pure modernist glass and steel box. Inside it displayed the most modernist work of the Exposition, the painting &quot;Guernica&quot; by Pablo Picasso. The original building was destroyed after the Exposition, but it was recreated in 1992 in Barcelona.

The rise of nationalism in the 1930s was reflected in the Fascist architecture of Italy, and Nazi architecture of Germany, based on classical styles and designed to express power and grandeur. The Nazi architecture, much of it designed by Albert Speer, was intended to awe the spectators by its huge scale. Adolf Hitler intended to turn Berlin into the capital of Europe, grander than Rome or Paris. The Nazis closed the Bauhaus, and the most prominent modern architects soon departed for Britain or the United States. In Italy, Benito Mussolini wished to present himself as the heir to the glory and empire of ancient Rome. Mussolini&#x27;s government was not as hostile to modernism as The Nazis; the spirit of Italian Rationalism of the 1920s continued, with the work of architect Giuseppe Terragni. His &quot;Casa del Fascio&quot; in Como, headquarters of the local Fascist party, was a perfectly modernist building, with geometric proportions (33.2 meters long by 16.6 meters high), a clean façade of marble, and a Renaissance-inspired interior courtyard. Opposed to Terragni was Marcello Piacitini, a proponent of monumental fascist architecture, who rebuilt the University of Rome, and designed the Italian pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition, and planned a grand reconstruction of Rome on the fascist model.

==New York World&#x27;s Fair (1939)==

The 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair marked a turning point in architecture between Art Deco and modern architecture. The theme of the Fair was the &quot;World of Tomorrow&quot;, and its symbols were the purely geometric trylon and periphery sculpture. It had many monuments to Art Deco, such as the Ford Pavilion in the Streamline Moderne style, but also included the new International Style that would replace Art Deco as the dominant style after the War. The Pavilions of Finland, by Alvar Aalto, of Sweden by Sven Markelius, and of Brazil by Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa, looked forward to a new style. They became leaders in the postwar modernist movement.

==World War II: wartime innovation and postwar reconstruction (1939–1945)==

World War II (1939–1945) and its aftermath was a major factor in driving innovation in building technology, and in turn, architectural possibilities. The wartime industrial demands resulted in shortages of steel and other building materials, leading to the adoption of new materials, such as aluminum, The war and postwar period brought greatly expanded use of prefabricated building; largely for the military and government. The semi-circular metal Nissen hut of World War I was revived as the Quonset hut. The years immediately after the war saw the development of radical experimental houses, including the enameled-steel Lustron house (1947–1950), and Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s experimental aluminum Dymaxion House.

The unprecedented destruction caused by the war was another factor in the rise of modern architecture. Large parts of major cities, from Berlin, Tokyo, and Dresden to Rotterdam and east London; all the port cities of France, particularly Le Havre, Brest, Marseille, Cherbourg had been destroyed by bombing. In the United States, little civilian construction had been done since the 1920s; housing was needed for millions of American soldiers returning from the war. The postwar housing shortages in Europe and the United States led to the design and construction of enormous government-financed housing projects, usually in run-down center of American cities, and in the suburbs of Paris and other European cities, where land was available,

One of the largest reconstruction projects was that of the city center of Le Havre, destroyed by the Germans and by Allied bombing in 1944; 133 hectares of buildings in the center were flattened, destroying 12,500 buildings and leaving 40,000 persons homeless. The architect Auguste Perret, a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete and prefabricated materials, designed and built an entirely new center to the city, with apartment blocks, cultural, commercial, and government buildings. He restored historic monuments when possible, and built a new church, St. Joseph, with a lighthouse-like tower in the center to inspire hope. His rebuilt city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005.

==Le Corbusier and the &quot;Cité Radieuse&quot; (1947–1952)==

Shortly after the War, the French architect Le Corbusier, who was nearly sixty years old and had not constructed a building in ten years, was commissioned by the French government to construct a new apartment block in Marseille. He called it Unité d&#x27;Habitation in Marseille, but it more popularly took the name of the Cité Radieuse (and later &quot;Cité du Fada&quot; &quot;City of the crazy one&quot; in Marseille French), after his book about futuristic urban planning. Following his doctrines of design, the building had a concrete frame raised up above the street on pylons. It contained 337 duplex apartment units, fit into the framework like pieces of a puzzle. Each unit had two levels and a small terrace. Interior &quot;streets&quot; had shops, a nursery school, and other serves, and the flat terrace roof had a running track, ventilation ducts, and a small theater. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets, and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. Unité d&#x27;Habitation became a prototype for similar buildings in other cities, both in France and Germany. Combined with his equally radical organic design for the Chapel of Notre-Dame du-Haut at Ronchamp, this work propelled Corbusier in the first rank of postwar modern architects.

== Team X and the 1953 International Congress of Modern Architecture ==

In the early 1950s, Michel Écochard, director of urban planning under the French Protectorate in Morocco, commissioned GAMMA ()—which initially included the architects Elie Azagury, George Candillis, Alexis Josic and Shadrach Woods—to design housing in the Hay Mohammedi neighborhood of Casablanca that provided a &quot;culturally specific living tissue&quot; for laborers and migrants from the countryside. Sémiramis, (Honeycomb), and Carrières Centrales were some of the first examples of this Vernacular Modernism.

At the 1953 &quot;Congrès Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture&quot; Moderne (CIAM), ATBAT-Afrique—the Africa branch of founded in 1947 by figures including Le Corbusier, Vladimir Bodiansky, and André Wogenscky—prepared a study of Casablanca&#x27;s bidonvilles entitled &quot;Habitat for the Greatest Number&quot;. The presenters, Georges Candilis and Michel Ecochard, argued—against doctrine—that architects must consider local culture and climate in their designs. This generated great debate among modernist architects around the world and eventually provoked a schism and the creation of Team 10. Ecochard&#x27;s 8x8 meter model at Carrières Centrales earned him recognition as a pioneer in the architecture of collective housing, though his Moroccan colleague Elie Azagury was critical of him for serving as a tool of the French colonial regime and for ignoring the economic and social necessity that Moroccans live in higher density vertical housing.

== Late modernist architecture ==
Late modernist architecture is generally understood to include buildings designed (1968–1980) with exceptions. Modernist architecture includes the buildings designed between 1945 and the 1960s. The late modernist style is characterized by bold shapes and sharp corners, slightly more defined than Brutalist architecture.

==Postwar modernism in the United States (1945–1985)==

The International Style of architecture had appeared in Europe, particularly in the Bauhaus movement, in the late 1920s. In 1932 it was recognized and given a name at an Exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City organized by architect Philip Johnson and architectural critic Henry-Russell Hitchcock, Between 1937 and 1941, following the rise Hitler and the Nazis in Germany, most of the leaders of the German Bauhaus movement found a new home in the United States, and played an important part in the development of American modern architecture.

===Frank Lloyd Wright and the Guggenheim Museum===

Frank Lloyd Wright was eighty years old in 1947; he had been present at the beginning of American modernism, and though he refused to accept that he belonged to any movement, continued to play a leading role almost to its end. One of his most original late projects was the campus of Florida Southern College in Lakeland, Florida, begun in 1941 and completed in 1943. He designed nine new buildings in a style that he described as &quot;The Child of the Sun&quot;. He wrote that he wanted the campus to &quot;grow out of the ground and into the light, a child of the sun&quot;.

He completed several notable projects in the 1940s, including the Johnson Wax Headquarters and the Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma (1956). The building is unusual that it is supported by its central core of four elevator shafts; the rest of the building is cantilevered to this core, like the branches of a tree. Wright originally planned the structure for an apartment building in New York City. That project was cancelled because of the Great Depression, and he adapted the design for an oil pipeline and equipment company in Oklahoma. He wrote that in New York City his building would have been lost in a forest of tall buildings, but that in Oklahoma it stood alone. The design is asymmetrical; each side is different.

In 1943 he was commissioned by the art collector Solomon R. Guggenheim to design a museum for his collection of modern art. His design was entirely original; a bowl-shaped building with a spiral ramp inside that led museum visitors on an upward tour of the art of the 20th century. Work began in 1946 but it was not completed until 1959, the year that he died.

===Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer===

Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus, moved to England in 1934 and spent three years there before being invited to the United States by Walter Hudnut of the Harvard Graduate School of Design; Gropius became the head of the architecture faculty. Marcel Breuer, who had worked with him at the Bauhaus, joined him and opened an office in Cambridge. The fame of Gropius and Breuer attracted many students, who themselves became famous architects, including Ieoh Ming Pei and Philip Johnson. They did not receive an important commission until 1941, when they designed housing for workers in Kensington, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh., In 1945 Gropius and Breuer associated with a group of younger architects under the name TAC (The Architects Collaborative). Their notable works included the building of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the U.S. Embassy in Athens (1956–57), and the headquarters of Pan American Airways in New York (1958–63).

===Ludwig Mies van der Rohe===
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe described his architecture with the famous saying, &quot;Less is more&quot;. As the director of the school of architecture of what is now called the Illinois Institute of Technology from 1939 to 1956, Mies (as he was commonly known) made Chicago the leading city for American modernism in the postwar years. He constructed new buildings for the Institute in modernist style, two high-rise apartment buildings on Lakeshore Drive (1948–51), which became models for high-rises across the country. Other major works included Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois (1945–1951), a simple horizontal glass box that had an enormous influence on American residential architecture. The Chicago Convention Center (1952–54) and Crown Hall at the Illinois Institute of Technology (1950–56), and The Seagram Building in New York City (1954–58) also set a new standard for purity and elegance. Based on granite pillars, the smooth glass and steel walls were given a touch of color by the use of bronze-toned I-beams in the structure. He returned to Germany in 1962–68 to build the new Nationalgallerie in Berlin. His students and followers included Philip Johnson, and Eero Saarinen, whose work was substantially influenced by his ideas.

===Richard Neutra and Charles and Ray Eames===

Influential residential architects in the new style in the United States included Richard Neutra and Charles and Ray Eames. The most celebrated work of the Eames was Eames House in Pacific Palisades, California, (1949) Charles Eames in collaboration with Eero Saarinen It is composed of two structures, an architects residence and his studio, joined in the form of an L. The house, influenced by Japanese architecture, is made of translucent and transparent panels organized in simple volumes, often using natural materials, supported on a steel framework. The frame of the house was assembled in sixteen hours by five workmen. He brightened up his buildings with panels of pure colors.

Richard Neutra continued to build influential houses in Los Angeles, using the theme of the simple box. Many of these houses erased the line distinction between indoor and outdoor spaces with walls of plate glass. Neutra&#x27;s Constance Perkins House in Pasadena, California (1962) was re-examination of the modest single-family dwelling. It was built of inexpensive material–wood, plaster, and glass–and completed at a cost of just under $18,000. Neutra scaled the house to the physical dimensions of its owner, a small woman. It features a reflecting pool which meanders under of the glass walls of the house. One of Neutra&#x27;s most unusual buildings was Shepherd&#x27;s Grove in Garden Grove, California, which featured an adjoining parking lot where worshippers could follow the service without leaving their cars.

===Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and Wallace K. Harrison===

Many of the notable modern buildings in the postwar years were produced by two architectural mega-agencies, which brought together large teams of designers for very complex projects. The firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill was founded in Chicago in 1936 by Louis Skidmore and Nathaniel Owings, and joined in 1939 by engineer John Merrill, It soon went under the name of SOM. Its first big project was Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the gigantic government installation that produced plutonium for the first nuclear weapons. In 1964 the firm had eighteen &quot;partner-owners&quot;, 54 &quot;associate participants, &quot;and 750 architects, technicians, designers, decorators, and landscape architects. Their style was largely inspired by the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and their buildings soon had a large place in the New York skyline, including the Manhattan House (1950–51), Lever House (1951–52) and the Manufacturers Trust Company Building (1954). Later buildings by the firm include Beinecke Library at Yale University (1963), the Willis Tower, formerly Sears Tower in Chicago (1973) and One World Trade Center in New York City (2013), which replaced the building destroyed in the terrorist attack of 11 September 2001.

Wallace Harrison played a major part in the modern architectural history of New York; as the architectural advisor of the Rockefeller Family, he helped design Rockefeller Center, the major Art Deco architectural project of the 1930s. He was supervising architect for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, and, with his partner Max Abramowitz, was the builder and chief architect of the headquarters of the United Nations; Harrison headed a committee of international architects, which included Oscar Niemeyer (who produced the original plan approved by the committee) and Le Corbusier. Other landmark New York buildings designed by Harrison and his firm included Metropolitan Opera House, the master plan for Lincoln Center, and John F. Kennedy International Airport.

===Philip Johnson===

Philip Johnson (1906–2005) was one of the youngest and last major figures in American modern architecture. He trained at Harvard with Walter Gropius, then was director of the department of architecture and modern design at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1946 to 1954. In 1947, he published a book about Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and in 1953 designed his own residence, the Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut in a style modeled after Mies&#x27;s Farnsworth House. Beginning in 1955 he began to go in his own direction, moving gradually toward expressionism with designs that increasingly departed from the orthodoxies of modern architecture. His final and decisive break with modern architecture was the AT&amp;T Building (later known as the Sony Tower), and now the 550 Madison Avenue in New York City, (1979) an essentially modernist skyscraper completely altered by the addition of broken pediment with a circular opening. This building is generally considered to mark the beginning of Postmodern architecture in the United States.

===Eero Saarinen===
Eero Saarinen (1910–1961) was the son of Eliel Saarinen, the most famous Finnish architect of the Art Nouveau period, who emigrated to the United States in 1923, when Eero was thirteen. He studied art and sculpture at the academy where his father taught, and then at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière Academy in Paris before studying architecture at Yale University. His architectural designs were more like enormous pieces of sculpture than traditional modern buildings; he broke away from the elegant boxes inspired by Mies van der Rohe and used instead sweeping curves and parabolas, like the wings of birds. In 1948 he conceived the idea of a monument in St. Louis, Missouri in the form of a parabolic arch 192 meters high, made of stainless steel (1948). He then designed the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan (1949–55), a glass modernist box in the style of Mies van der Rohe, followed by the IBM Research Center in Yorktown, Virginia (1957–61). His next works were a major departure in style; he produced a particularly striking sculptural design for the Ingalls Rink in New Haven, Connecticut (1956–59, an ice skiing rink with a parabolic roof suspended from cables, which served as a preliminary model for next and most famous work, the TWA Terminal at JFK airport in New York (1956–1962). His declared intention was to design a building that was distinctive and memorable, and also one that would capture the particular excitement of passengers before a journey. The structure is separated into four white concrete parabolic vaults, which together resemble a bird on the ground perched for flight. Each of the four curving roof vaults has two sides attached to columns in a Y form just outside the structure. One of the angles of each shell is lightly raised, and the other is attached to the center of the structure. The roof is connected with the ground by curtain walls of glass. All of the details inside the building, including the benches, counters, escalators, and clocks, were designed in the same style.

===Louis Kahn===

Louis Kahn (1901–74) was another American architect who moved away from the Mies van der Rohe model of the glass box, and other dogmas of the prevailing international style. He borrowed from a wide variety of styles, and idioms, including neoclassicism. He was a professor of architecture at Yale University from 1947 to 1957, where his students included Eero Saarinen. From 1957 until his death he was a professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. His work and ideas influenced Philip Johnson, Minoru Yamasaki, and Edward Durell Stone as they moved toward a more neoclassical style. Unlike Mies, he did not try to make his buildings look light; he constructed mainly with concrete and brick, and made his buildings look monumental and solid. He drew from a wide variety of different sources; the towers of Richards Medical Research Laboratories were inspired by the architecture of the Renaissance towns he had seen in Italy as a resident architect at the American Academy in Rome in 1950. Notable buildings by Kahn in the United States include the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York (1962); and the Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas (1966–72). Following the example of Le Corbusier and his design of the government buildings in Chandigarh, the capital city of the Haryana &amp; Punjab State of India, Kahn designed the Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban (National Assembly Building) in Dhaka, Bangladesh (1962–74), when that country won independence from Pakistan. It was Kahn&#x27;s last work.

===I. M. Pei===
I. M. Pei (1917–2019) was a major figure in late modernism and the debut of Post-modern architecture. He was born in China and educated in the United States, studying architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While the architecture school there still trained in the Beaux-Arts architecture style, Pei discovered the writings of Le Corbusier, and a two-day visit by Le Corbusier to the campus in 1935 had a major impact on Pei&#x27;s ideas of architecture. In the late 1930s, he moved to the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he studied with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer and became deeply involved in Modernism. After the war he worked on large projects for the New York real estate developer William Zeckendorf, before breaking away and starting his own firm. One of the first buildings his own firm designed was the Green Building at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While the clean modernist façade was admired, the building developed an unexpected problem; it created a wind tunnel effect, and in strong winds the doors could not be opened. Pei was forced to construct a tunnel so visitors could enter the building during high winds.

Between 1963 and 1967 Pei designed the Mesa Laboratory for the National Center for Atmospheric Research outside Boulder, Colorado, in an open area at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The project differed from Pei&#x27;s earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. His design was a striking departure from traditional modernism; it looked as if it were carved out of the side of the mountain.

In the late modernist area, art museums bypassed skyscrapers as the most prestigious architectural projects; they offered greater possibilities for innovation in form and more visibility. Pei established himself with his design for the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York (1973), which was praised for its imaginative use of a small space, and its respect for the landscape and other buildings around it. This led to the commission for one of the most important museum projects of the period, the new East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, completed in 1978, and to another of Pei&#x27;s most famous projects, the pyramid at the entrance of Louvre Museum in Paris (1983–89). Pei chose the pyramid as the form that best harmonized with the Renaissance and neoclassical forms of the historic Louvre, as well as for its associations with Napoleon and the Battle of the Pyramids. Each face of the pyramid is supported by 128 beams of stainless steel, supporting 675 panels of glass, each .

===Fazlur Rahman Khan===
In 1955, employed by the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), he began working in Chicago. He was made a partner in 1966. He worked the rest of his life side by side with Architect Bruce Graham. Khan introduced design methods and concepts for efficient use of material in building architecture. His first building to employ the tube structure was the Chestnut De-Witt apartment building. During the 1960s and 1970s, he became noted for his designs for Chicago&#x27;s 100-story John Hancock Center, which was the first building to use the trussed-tube design, and 110-story Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998, which was the first building to use the framed-tube design.

He believed that engineers needed a broader perspective on life, saying, &quot;The technical man must not be lost in his own technology; he must be able to appreciate life, and life is art, drama, music, and most importantly, people.&quot; Khan&#x27;s personal papers, most of which were in his office at the time of his death, are held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Fazlur Khan Collection includes manuscripts, sketches, audio cassette tapes, slides and other materials regarding his work.

Khan&#x27;s seminal work of developing tall building structural systems are still used today as the starting point when considering design options for tall buildings. Tube structures have since been used in many skyscrapers, including the construction of the World Trade Center, Aon Centre, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, Bank of China Tower and most other buildings in excess of 40 stories constructed since the 1960s. The strong influence of tube structure design is also evident in the world&#x27;s current tallest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. According to Stephen Bayley of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;:
===Minoru Yamasaki===

In the United States, Minoru Yamasaki found major independent success in implementing unique engineering solutions to then-complicated problems, including the space that elevator shafts took up on each floor, and dealing with his personal fear of heights. During this period, he created a number of office buildings which led to his innovative design of the towers of the World Trade Center in 1964, which began construction 21 March 1966. The first of the towers was finished in 1970. Many of his buildings feature superficial details inspired by the pointed arches of Gothic architecture, and make use of extremely narrow vertical windows. This narrow-windowed style arose from his own personal fear of heights. One particular design challenge of the World Trade Center&#x27;s design related to the efficacy of the elevator system, which was unique in the world. Yamasaki integrated the fastest elevators at the time, running at 1,700 feet per minute. Instead of placing a large traditional elevator shaft in the core of each tower, Yamasaki created the Twin Towers&#x27; &quot;Skylobby&quot; system. The Skylobby design created three separate, connected elevator systems which would serve different segments of the building, depending on which floor was chosen, saving approximately 70% of the space used for a traditional shaft. The space saved was then used for office space. In addition to these accomplishments, he had also designed the Pruitt-Igoe Housing Project, the largest ever housing project built in the United States, which was fully torn down in 1976 due to bad market conditions and the decrepit state of the buildings themselves. Separately, he had also designed the Century Plaza Towers and One Woodward Avenue, among 63 other projects he had developed during his career.

==Postwar modernism in Europe (1945–1975)==
In France, Le Corbusier remained the most prominent architect, though he built few buildings there. His most prominent late work was the convent of Sainte Marie de La Tourette in Eveux-sur-l&#x27;Arbresle. The Convent, built of raw concrete, was austere and without ornament, inspired by the medieval monasteries he had visited on his first trip to Italy.

In Britain, the major figures in modernism included Wells Coates (1895–1958), FRS Yorke (1906–1962), James Stirling (1926–1992) and Denys Lasdun (1914–2001). Lasdun&#x27;s best-known work is the Royal National Theatre (1967–1976) on the south bank of the Thames. Its raw concrete and blockish form offended British traditionalists; Charles III, King of the U.K compared it with a nuclear power station.

In Belgium, a major figure was Charles Vandenhove (born 1927) who constructed an important series of buildings for the University Hospital Center in Liège. His later work ventured into colorful rethinking of historical styles, such as Palladian architecture.

In Finland, the most influential architect was Alvar Aalto, who adapted his version of modernism to the Nordic landscape, light, and materials, particularly the use of wood. After World War II, he taught architecture in the United States. In Denmark, Arne Jacobsen was the best-known of the modernists, who designed furniture as well as carefully proportioned buildings.

In Italy, the most prominent modernist was Gio Ponti, who worked often with the structural engineer Pier Luigi Nervi, a specialist in reinforced concrete. Nervi created concrete beams of exceptional length, twenty-five meters, which allowed greater flexibility in forms and greater heights. Their best-known design was the Pirelli Building in Milan (1958–1960), which for decades was the tallest building in Italy.

The most famous Spanish modernist was the Catalan architect Josep Lluis Sert, who worked with great success in Spain, France, and the United States. In his early career, he worked for a time under Le Corbusier, and designed the Spanish pavilion for the 1937 Paris Exposition. His notable later work included the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Provence, France (1964), and the Harvard Science Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served as Dean of Architecture at the Harvard School of Design.

Notable German modernists included Johannes Krahn, who played an important part in rebuilding German cities after World War II, and built several important museums and churches, notably St. Martin, Idstein, which artfully combined stone masonry, concrete, and glass. Leading Austrian architects of the style included Gustav Peichl, whose later works included the Art and Exhibition Center of the German Federal Republic in Bonn, Germany (1989).

== Tropical Modernism ==

Tropical Modernism, or Tropical Modern, is a style of architecture that merges modernist architecture principles with tropical vernacular traditions, emerging in the mid-20th century. The term is used to describe modernist architecture in various regions of the world, including Latin America, Asia and Africa, as detailed below. Architects adapted to local conditions by using features which encouraged protection from harsh sunlight (such as solar shading) and encouraged the flow of cooling breezes through buildings (through narrow corridors). Some contend that the style originated in the &quot;hot, humid conditions&quot; of West Africa in the 1940s. Typical features include geometric screens. Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, of the Architectural Association architecture school in London, UK, made important contributions to research and practice in the Tropical Modernism style, after founding the School of Tropical Study at the AA. Speaking about the adoption of modernism in post-independence Ghana, Professor Ola Ukuku, states that those involved in developing Tropical Modernism were actually operating as agents of the colonies at the time.

==Latin America==

Architectural historians sometimes label Latin American modernism as &quot;tropical modernism&quot;. This reflects architects who adapted modernism to the tropical climate as well as the sociopolitical contexts of Latin America.

Brazil became a showcase of modern architecture in the late 1930s through the work of Lúcio Costa (1902–1998) and Oscar Niemeyer (1907–2012). Costa had the lead and Niemeyer collaborated on the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro (1936–43) and the Brazilian pavilion at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair in New York. Following the war, Niemeyer, along with Le Corbusier, conceived the form of the United Nations Headquarters constructed by Walter Harrison.

Lúcio Costa also had overall responsibility for the plan of the most audacious modernist project in Brazil; the creation of new capital, Brasília, constructed between 1956 and 1961. Costa made the general plan, laid out in the form of a cross, with the major government buildings in the center. Niemeyer was responsible for designing the government buildings, including the palace of the President;the National Assembly, composed of two towers for the two branches of the legislature and two meeting halls, one with a cupola and other with an inverted cupola. Niemeyer also built the cathedral, eighteen ministries, and giant blocks of housing, each designed for three thousand residents, each with its own school, shops, and chapel. Modernism was employed both as an architectural principle and as a guideline for organizing society, as explored in &quot;The Modernist City.&quot;

Following a military coup d&#x27;état in Brazil in 1964, Niemeyer moved to France, where he designed the modernist headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris (1965–1980), a miniature of his United Nations plan.

Mexico also had a prominent modernist movement. Important figures included Félix Candela, born in Spain, who emigrated to Mexico in 1939; he specialized in concrete structures in unusual parabolic forms. Another important figure was Mario Pani, who designed the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City (1949), and the Torre Insignia (1988); Pani was also instrumental in the construction of the new University of Mexico City in the 1950s, alongside Juan O&#x27;Gorman, Eugenio Peschard, and Enrique del Moral. The Torre Latinoamericana, designed by Augusto H. Alvarez, was one of the earliest modernist skyscrapers in Mexico City (1956); it successfully withstood the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which destroyed many other buildings in the city center. Pedro Ramirez Vasquez and Rafael Mijares designed the Olympic Stadium for the 1968 Olympics, and Antoni Peyri and Candela designed the Palace of Sports. Luis Barragan was another influential figure in Mexican modernism; his raw concrete residence and studio in Mexico City looks like a blockhouse on the outside, while inside it features great simplicity in form, pure colors, abundant natural light, and, one of is signatures, a stairway without a railing. He won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1980, and the house was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.

==Asia and Australia==
Japan, like Europe, had an enormous shortage of housing after the war, due to the bombing of many cities. 4.2 million housing units needed to be replaced. Japanese architects combined both traditional and modern styles and techniques. One of the foremost Japanese modernists was Kunio Maekawa (1905–1986), who had worked for Le Corbusier in Paris until 1930. His own house in Tokyo was an early landmark of Japanese modernism, combining traditional style with ideas he acquired working with Le Corbusier. His notable buildings include concert halls in Tokyo and Kyoto and the International House of Japan in Tokyo, all in the pure modernist style.

Kenzo Tange (1913–2005) worked in the studio of Kunio Maekawa from 1938 until 1945 before opening his own architectural firm. His first major commission was the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum . He designed many notable office buildings and cultural centers. office buildings, as well as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The gymnasium, built of concrete, features a roof suspended over the stadium on steel cables.

The Danish architect Jørn Utzon (1918–2008) worked briefly with Alvar Aalto, studied the work of Le Corbusier, and traveled to the United States to meet Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1957 he designed one of the most recognizable modernist buildings in the world; the Sydney Opera House. He is known for the sculptural qualities of his buildings, and their relationship with the landscape. The five concrete shells of the structure resemble seashells by the beach. Begun in 1957, the project encountered considerable technical difficulties making the shells and getting the acoustics right. Utzon resigned in 1966, and the opera house was not finished until 1973, ten years after its scheduled completion.

In India, modernist architecture was promoted by the postcolonial state under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, most notably by inviting Le Corbusier to design the city of Chandigarh. Although Nehru advocated for young Indians to be part of Le Corbuiser&#x27;s design team in order to refine their skills whilst building their city, the team included only one female Indian architect, Eulie Chowdhury. Important Indian modernist architects also include BV Doshi, Charles Correa, Raj Rewal, Achyut Kanvinde, and Habib Rahman. Much discussion around modernist architecture took place in the journal MARG. In Sri Lanka, Geoffrey Bawa pioneered Tropical Modernism. Minnette De Silva was an important Sri Lankan modernist architect.

Post independence architecture in Pakistan is a blend of Islamic and modern styles of architecture with influences from Mughal, indo-Islamic and international architectural designs. The 1960s and 1970s was a period of architectural Significance. Jinnah&#x27;s Mausoleum, Minar e Pakistan, Bab e Khyber, Islamic summit minar and the Faisal mosque date from this time.

== Africa ==
Modernist architecture in Ghana is also considered part of Tropical Modernism.

Some notable modernist architects in Morocco were Elie Azagury and Jean-François Zevaco.

Asmara, capitol of Eritrea, is well known for its modernist architecture dating from the period of Italian colonization.

==Preservation==
Several works or collections of modern architecture have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. In addition to the early experiments associated with Art Nouveau, these include a number of the structures mentioned above in this article: the Rietveld Schröder House in Utrecht, the Bauhaus structures in Weimar, Dessau, and Bernau, the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates, the White City of Tel Aviv, the city of Asmara, the city of Brasília, the Ciudad Universitaria of UNAM in Mexico City and the University City of Caracas in Venezuela, the Sydney Opera House, and the Centennial Hall in Wrocław, along with select works from Le Corbursier and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Private organizations such as Docomomo International, the World Monuments Fund, and the Recent Past Preservation Network are working to safeguard and document imperiled Modern architecture. In 2006, the World Monuments Fund launched &quot;Modernism at Risk&quot;, an advocacy and conservation program. The organization MAMMA. is working to document and preserve modernist architecture in Morocco.

<text>In telecommunications, Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System or CTCSS is one type of in-band signaling that is used to reduce the annoyance of listening to other users on a shared two-way radio communication channel. It is sometimes referred to as tone squelch or PL for Private Line, a trademark of Motorola. It does this by adding a low frequency audio tone to the voice. Where more than one group of users is on the same radio frequency (called &quot;co-channel users&quot;), CTCSS circuitry mutes those users who are using a different CTCSS tone or no CTCSS. 

CTCSS tone codes are sometimes referred to as sub-channels, but this is a misnomer because no additional radio channels are created. All users with different CTCSS tones on the same channel are still transmitting on the identical radio frequency, and their transmissions interfere with each other; however; the interference is masked under most conditions. Although it provides some protection against interference, CTCSS does not offer any security against interception or jamming, and receivers without CTCSS enabled will still hear all traffic.

A receiver with just a carrier or noise squelch does not suppress any sufficiently strong signal; in CTCSS mode it unmutes only when the signal also carries the correct sub-audible audio tone. The tones are not actually below the range of human hearing, but are poorly reproduced by most communications-grade speakers and in any event are usually filtered out before being sent to the speaker or headphone.

==Theory of operation==
Radio transmitters using CTCSS always transmit their own tone code whenever the transmit button is pressed. The tone is transmitted at a low level simultaneously with the voice. This is called CTCSS &quot;encoding&quot;. CTCSS tones range from 67 to 257 Hz. The tones are usually referred to as &quot;sub-audible tones&quot;. In an FM two-way radio system, CTCSS encoder levels are usually set for 15% of system deviation. For example, in a 5 kHz deviation system, the CTCSS tone level would normally be set to 750 Hz deviation. Engineered systems may call for different level settings in the 500 Hz to 1 kHz (10–20%) range.

The ability of a receiver to mute the audio until it detects a carrier with the correct CTCSS tone is called &quot;decoding&quot;. Receivers are equipped with features to allow the CTCSS &quot;lock&quot; to be disabled. On a base station console, a microphone may have a split push-to-talk button. Pressing one half of the button, (often marked with a speaker icon or the letters &quot;MON&quot;, short for &quot;MONitor&quot;) disables the CTCSS decoder and reverts the receiver to hearing any signal on the channel. This is called the &quot;monitor&quot; function. There is sometimes a mechanical interlock: the user must push down and hold the monitor button or the transmit button is locked and cannot be pressed. This interlock option is referred to as &quot;compulsory monitor before transmit&quot; (the user is forced to monitor by the hardware design of the equipment itself). On mobile radios, the microphone is usually stored in a hang-up clip or a hang-up box containing a microphone clip. When the user pulls the microphone out of the hang-up clip to make a call, a switch in the clip (box) forces the receiver to revert to conventional carrier squelch mode (&quot;monitor&quot;). Some designs relocate the switch into the body of the microphone itself. In hand-held radios, an LED indicator may glow green, yellow, or orange to indicate another user is talking on the channel. Hand-held radios usually have a switch or push-button to monitor. Some modern radios have a feature called &quot;Busy Channel Lockout&quot;, which will not allow the user to transmit as long as the radio is receiving another signal.

A CTCSS decoder is based on a very narrow bandpass filter which passes the desired CTCSS tone. The filter&#x27;s output is amplified and rectified, creating a DC voltage whenever the desired tone is present. The DC voltage is used to turn on, enable, or unmute the receiver&#x27;s speaker audio stages. When the tone is present, the receiver is unmuted, when it is not present the receiver is silent.

Because period is the inverse of frequency, lower tone frequencies can take longer to decode (depends on the decoder design). Receivers in a system using 67.0 Hz can take noticeably longer to decode than ones using 203.5 Hz, and they can take longer than one decoding 250.3 Hz. In some repeater systems, the time lag can be significant. The lower tone may cause one or two syllables to be clipped before the receiver audio is unmuted (is heard). This is because receivers are decoding in a chain. The repeater receiver must first sense the carrier signal on the input, then decode the CTCSS tone. When that occurs, the system transmitter turns on, encoding the CTCSS tone on its carrier signal (the output frequency). All radios in the system start decoding after they sense a carrier signal then recognize the tone on the carrier as valid. Any distortion on the encoded tone will also affect the decoding time.

Engineered systems often use tones in the 127.3 Hz to 162.2 Hz range to balance fast decoding with keeping the tones out of the audible part of the receive audio. Most amateur radio repeater controller manufacturers offer an audio delay option—this delays the repeated speech audio for a selectable number of milliseconds before it is retransmitted. During this fixed delay period (the amount of which is adjusted during installation, then locked down), the CTCSS decoder has enough time to recognize the right tone. This way the problem with lost syllables at the beginning of a transmission can be overcome without having to use higher frequency tones.

In early systems, it was common to avoid the use of adjacent tones. On channels where every available tone is not in use, this is good engineering practice. For example, an ideal would be to avoid using 97.4 Hz and 100.0 Hz on the same channel. The tones are so close that some decoders may periodically false trigger. The user occasionally hears a syllable or two of co-channel users on a different CTCSS tone talking. As electronic components age, or through production variances, some radios in a system may be better than others at rejecting nearby tone frequencies.

===Digital-Coded Squelch===
CTCSS is an analog system. A later Digital-Coded Squelch (DCS) system was developed by Motorola under the trademarked name Digital Private Line (DPL). General Electric responded with the same system under the name of Digital Channel Guard (DCG). The generic name is CDCSS (Continuous Digital-Coded Squelch System). The use of digital squelch on a channel that has existing tone squelch users precludes the use of the 131.8 and 136.5 Hz tones as the digital bit rate is 134.4 bits per second and the decoders set to those two tones will sense an intermittent signal (referred to in the two-way radio field as &quot;falsing&quot; the decoder).

==List of tones==
CTCSS tones are standardized by the EIA/TIA. The full list of the tones can be found in their original standard RS-220A, and the most recent EIA/TIA-603-E; the CTCSS tones also may be listed in manufacturers instruction, maintenance or operational manuals. Some systems use non-standard tones. The NATO Military radios use 150.0 Hz, and this can be found in the user manuals for the radios. Some areas do not use certain tones. For example, the tone of 100.0 Hz is avoided in the United Kingdom since this is twice the UK mains power line frequency; an inadequately smoothed power supply may cause unwanted squelch opening (this is true in many other areas that use 50 Hz power). Tones typically come from one of three series as listed below along with the two character PL code used by Motorola to identify tones. The most common set of supported tones is a set of 39 tones including all tones with Motorola PL codes, except for the tones 8Z, 9Z, and 0Z (zero-Z). The lowest series has adjacent tones that are roughly in the harmonic ratio of 20.05 to 1 (≈1.035265), while the other two series have adjacent tones roughly in the ratio of 100.015 to 1 (≈1.035142). An example technical description can be found in a Philips technical information sheet about their CTCSS products.

===Notes===
==Reverse CTCSS==
Some professional systems use a phase-reversal of the CTCSS tone at the end of a transmission to eliminate the squelch crash or squelch tail. This is common with General Electric Mobile Radio and Motorola systems. When the user releases the push-to-talk button the CTCSS tone does a phase shift for about 200 milliseconds. In older systems, the tone decoders used mechanical reeds to decode CTCSS tones. When audio at a resonant pitch was fed into the reed, it would resonate, which would turn on the speaker audio. The end-of-transmission phase reversal (called &quot;Reverse Burst&quot; by Motorola (and trademarked by them) and &quot;Squelch Tail Elimination&quot; or &quot;STE&quot; by GE ) caused the reed to abruptly stop vibrating which would cause the receive audio to instantly mute. Initially, a phase shift of 180 degrees was used, but experience showed that a shift of ±120 to 135 degrees was optimal in halting the mechanical reeds. These systems often have audio muting logic set for CTCSS only. If a transmitter without the phase reversal feature is used, the squelch can remain unmuted for as long as the reed continues to vibrate—up to 1.5 seconds at the end of a transmission as it coasts to a stop (sometimes referred to as the &quot;flywheel effect&quot; or called &quot;freewheeling&quot;).

==Interference and CTCSS==
In non-critical uses, CTCSS can also be used to hide the presence of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments. The interference will still be present and may block the receiver, but the decoder will prevent it from being heard. It will still degrade system performance but the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.

CTCSS is commonly used in VHF and UHF amateur radio operations for this purpose. Wideband and extremely sensitive radios are common in the amateur radio field, which imposes limits on achievable intermodulation and adjacent-channel performance.

Family Radio Service (FRS), PMR446 and other consumer-grade radios often include a CTCSS feature called &quot;Interference Eliminator Codes&quot;, &quot;sub-channels&quot;, &quot;privacy tones&quot;, or &quot;privacy codes&quot;. These do not afford privacy or security, but serve only to reduce annoying interference by other users or other noise sources; a receiver with the tone squelch turned off will hear everything on the channel. GMRS/FRS radios offering CTCSS codes typically provide a choice of 38 tones, but the tone number and the tone frequencies used may vary from one manufacturer to another (or even within product lines of one manufacturer) and should not be assumed to be consistent (i.e. &quot;Tone 12&quot; in one set of radios may not be &quot;Tone 12&quot; in another).

<doc id="315929" wikidata="Q1329260" url="?curid=315929" title="Calendar reform">
<text>Calendar reform or calendrical reform is any significant revision of a calendar system. The term sometimes is used instead for a proposal to switch to a different calendar design.

== Principles ==
The prime objective of a calendar is to unambiguously identify any day in past, present and future by a specific date in order to record or organize social, religious, commercial or administrative events. Recurring periods that contain multiple days, such as weeks, months, and years, are secondary, convenient features of a calendar. Most cultures adopt a primary dating system, but different cultures have always needed to align multiple calendars with each other, either because they coexisted in the same space (e.g. secular and religious groups with different demands) or had established trading relations.

Once specified, a &quot;calendar design&quot; cannot be altered without becoming a new design. If a proposed design is sufficiently close to the legacy one, i.e. compatible with it, a &quot;reform&quot; of the local &quot;calendar system&quot; is possible without disruption. Examples of this include the changes to the Chinese calendar due to problems between regions in China and practical changes in religious calendars such as the Islamic calendar, where the start of the month is now derived from astronomical data rather than sightings by religious leaders.

Some design changes, however, will yield date identifiers different from the previous design for some days, often in the distant past or future.

The calendar system must clarify whether dates are changed to the new design retroactively (using a &quot;proleptic calendar&quot;) or whether the design in use then and there shall be respected. Calendar schisms happen if not all cultures that adopted a common calendar system before perform a calendar reform at the same time. If date identifiers are similar but different, confusion and mistakes are unavoidable.

Most calendars have several rules which could be altered by reform:
* Whether and how days are grouped into subdivisions such as months and weeks, and days outside those subdivisions, if any.
* Which years are leap years and common years and how they differ.
* Numbering of years, selection of the epoch, and the issue of year zero.
* Start of the year (such as the December solstice, January 1, March 1, March equinox, Lady Day).
* If a week is retained, the start, length, and names of its days.
* Start of the day (midnight, sunrise, noon, or sunset).
* If months are retained, number, lengths, and names of months.
* Special days and periods (such as leap day or intercalary day).
* Alignment with social cycles.
* Alignment with astronomical cycles.
* Alignment with biological cycles.
* Literal notation of dates.

== Historical reforms ==
Historically, most calendar reforms have been made in order to synchronize the calendar with the astronomical year (either solar or sidereal) and/or the synodic month in lunar or lunisolar calendars. Most reforms for calendars have been to make them more accurate. This has happened to various lunar and lunisolar calendars, and also the Julian calendar, when it was altered to the Gregorian calendar.

The fundamental problems of the calendar are that the astronomical year has neither a whole number of days nor a whole number of lunar months; neither does the lunar month have a whole number of days: in each case there are fractions &quot;left over&quot;. (In some physical circumstances the rotations and revolutions of a planet and its satellite(s) can be phase-locked – for example the same side of the moon always faces us – but this has not operated to lock together the lengths of the Earth&#x27;s year, day and month.) Such remainders could accumulate from one period to the next, thereby driving the cycles out of synchronization.

A typical solution to force synchronization is intercalation. This means occasionally adding an extra day, week, or month into the cycle. An alternative approach is to ignore the mismatch and simply let the cycles continue to drift apart. The general approaches include:
* The lunar calendar, which fits days into the cycle of lunar months, adding an extra day when needed, while ignoring the annual solar cycle of the seasons.
* The solar calendar, which fits artificial months into the year, adding an extra day into one month when needed, while ignoring the lunar cycle of new/full moons.
* The lunisolar calendar, which keeps both the lunar and solar cycles, adding an extra month into the year when needed.

An obvious disadvantage of the lunisolar method of inserting a whole extra month is the large irregularity of the length of the year from one to the next. The simplicity of a lunar calendar has always been outweighed by its inability to track the seasons, and a solar calendar is used in conjunction to remedy this defect. Identifying the lunar cycle month requires straightforward observation of the Moon on a clear night. However, identifying seasonal cycles requires much more methodical observation of stars or a device to track solar day-to-day progression, such as that established at places like Stonehenge. After centuries of empirical observations, the theoretical aspects of calendar construction could become more refined, enabling predictions that identified the need for reform.

=== Reform of lunar and lunisolar calendars ===
There have been 50 to 100 reforms of the traditional Chinese calendar over 2500 years, most of which were intended to better fit the calendar months to astronomical lunations and to more accurately add the extra month so that the regular months maintain their proper seasonal positions, even though each seasonal marker can occur anywhere within its month.
There have been at least four similar reforms of the lunisolar version of the Hindu calendar, all intended to make the month a better match to the lunation and to make the year a better fit to the &quot;sidereal&quot; year. There have been reforms of the &quot;solar&quot; version of the Hindu calendar which changed the distribution of the days in each month to better match the length of time that the Sun spends in each &quot;sidereal&quot; zodiacal sign. The same applies to the Buddhist calendar. The first millennium reform of the Hebrew calendar changed it from an observational calendar into a calculated calendar. The Islamic calendar was a reform of the preceding lunisolar calendar which completely divorced it from the solar year.

Another reform was performed in Seljuk Persia by Omar Khayyam and others, developing the precisely computed Jalali calendar.

=== Julian and Gregorian reforms ===

When Julius Caesar took power in Rome, the Roman calendar had ceased to reflect the year accurately.

The Julian reform made 46 BC 445 days long and replaced the intercalary month with an intercalary day to be inserted within February every four years. This produced a noticeably more accurate calendar, but it had an average year length of 365 days and six hours (365.25 days), which had the effect of adding about three-quarters of an hour every four years. The effect accumulated from inception in 45 BC until by the 16th century the northward equinox was falling on March 10 or 11.

Under Pope Gregory XIII, the leap year rule was altered: only centennial years evenly divisible by 400 are leap years. Thus, the years 1600, 2000, 2400, and 2800 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2900, and 3000 are common years despite being divisible by 4. This rule makes the mean year 365.2425 days long. While this does not synchronize the years entirely, it would require a few thousand years to accumulate a day.

So that the northward equinox would have the same date in the new Gregorian calendar as it had when the Council of Nicaea made recommendations in AD 325 (), ten days were dropped so that became in 1582. This reform took a few centuries to spread through the nations that used the Julian calendar, although the Russian church year still uses the Julian calendar. Those nations that adopted this calendar on or after 1700, had to drop more than ten days: Great Britain, for instance, dropped eleven.

In 1923, Milutin Milanković proposed to a synod of some Eastern Orthodox Churches at Constantinople that only centennial years that leave a remainder of 200 or 600 upon division by 900 would be leap years, decreasing the average year length to 365.24 days: these remainders were chosen to delay as much as possible the first year (after the year of 1923) that this calendar would disagree with the Gregorian calendar, which occurs in until 2800. It was adopted by some Eastern Orthodox Churches, under the names Revised Julian calendar or New calendar, but was rejected by others.

== Proposals ==
The Gregorian calendar is currently used by most of the world. There is also an international standard describing the calendar, ISO 8601, with some differences from traditional conceptions in many cultures.

Since the papal reform in 1582, several proposals have been offered to make the Gregorian calendar more useful or regular. Very few reforms have gained official acceptance. The rather different decimal French Republican Calendar was one such official reform, but was abolished twelve years later by Napoleon. After World War II, the newly formed United Nations continued efforts of its predecessor, the League of Nations, to establish the proposed World Calendar but postponed the issue after a veto from the government of the United States, which was mainly based upon concerns of religious groups about the proposed days that would be outside the seven-day week cycle (&quot;blank days&quot;) and thus disrupt having a sabbath every seven days. Independently the World Council of Churches still tries to find a common rule for the date of Easter, which might be eased by a new common calendar.

Reformers cite several problems with the Gregorian calendar:
* It is not perennial. Each year starts on a different day of the week and calendars expire every year.
* It is difficult to determine the weekday of any given day of the year or month.
* Months are not equal in length, nor regularly distributed across the year, and so some people rely on mnemonics (e.g., &quot;Thirty days hath September&quot; or knuckle counting) to remember the lengths of months.
* The year&#x27;s four quarters (of three full months each) are not equal (being of 90/91, 91, 92 and 92 days respectively). Business quarters that are equal would make accounting easier.
* Its epoch, i.e. start of the year count, is religious. The same applies to month and weekday names in many languages.
* Each month has no connection with the lunar phases.
* Solstices and equinoxes do not coincide with either the beginning of the Gregorian months or the midpoint of the months.
* The calendar does not have a year zero: the year after 1 BC was 1 AD, with nothing in between them.

It is hard or even impossible to solve all these issues in just one calendar.

Most plans evolve around the solar year of a little more than 365 days. This number does not divide well by seven or twelve, which are the traditional numbers of days per week and months per year respectively. The nearby numbers 360, 364 and 366 are divisible in better ways. There are also lunar-centric proposals.

=== Perennial calendars ===

Many calendar reforms have offered solutions to make the Gregorian calendar perennial. These reforms would make it easy to work out the day of the week of a particular date, and would make changing calendars each year unnecessary. There are, roughly speaking, two options to achieve this goal: leap week calendars and intercalary days. Leap week calendars add a leap week of seven days to the calendar every five or six years to keep the calendar roughly in step with the tropical year. They have years of either 364 days (52 weeks) or 371 days (53 weeks), thus preserving the 7-day week.

Proposals mainly differ in their selection of a leap rule, placing of the leap item (usually middle or end of the year), in the start day of the week and year, in the number (12 or 13) and size of months and in connected naming; some are compatible to the week date of ISO 8601.

The World Calendar, favored by the UN in the 1950s, and the International Fixed Calendar, quite popular among economists between the World Wars, are proposals that start each year on a Sunday. The 364 days within the week system form 52 weeks of 7 days. The World Calendar has every quarter beginning on the same day of the week. In the World Calendar, the 365th and 366th day are considered holidays and named Worlds Day and Leap Year Day. These &quot;off-calendar&quot; days stand outside the seven-day week and caused some religious groups to strongly oppose adoption of the World Calendar. Such concerns helped prevent the World Calendar from being adopted. Supporters of the World Calendar, however, argue that the religious groups&#x27; opposition overlooked every individual&#x27;s right to celebrate these holidays as extra days of worship, or Sabbaths. This option, they reason, maintained the seven-day worship cycle for those who share that concern, while allowing benefits of a perennial calendar to be shared by all.

Some calendar reform ideas, such as the Pax Calendar, Symmetry454 calendar and the Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar, were created to solve this problem by having years of either 364 days (52 weeks) or 371 days (53 weeks), thus preserving the 7-day week. The 53-week calendar, used in government and in business for fiscal years, is a variant of this concept. Each year of this calendar can be up to 371 days long.

Some calendars have quarters of regularly patterned uneven months e.g., a 35-day (five-week) month and a pair of 28-day (four-week) months, with a leap week appended to the final month when needed. The Common Civil Calendar and Time calendar has months of 30 and 31 days, but inserts a leap week in the middle of the year, when needed, whereas its successor, the Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar, moves the extra week to the end of the year.

In the World Season Calendar, months are discarded altogether; instead, the year is divided into four seasons of 13 weeks each. An extra day (two days during leap year) is added to the calendar that is not assigned a day of the week in order to perennialize the calendar. The same calendar of 91 days is used for each season of every year.

=== 10-month calendars ===

A decimal calendar is a calendar which includes units of time based on the decimal system.

The French Republican Calendar was introduced (along with decimal time) in 1793. It consisted of twelve months, each divided into three &quot;décades&quot; of ten days, with five or six intercalary days called &quot;sansculottides&quot;. The calendar was abolished by Napoleon on January 1, 1806.

=== 12-month calendars ===
The lengths of the months inherited from the old Roman calendar as reformed by Julius Caesar do not follow any apparent logic systematically. Many reform proposals seek to make the pattern more uniform.
When keeping the traditional dozen months and the close approximation of a solar year, this usually yields four equal quarters of three months each where one month is longer than the other two. World Calendar and Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar follow this with 31:30:30 and 30:30:31 days per month, respectively. On the other hand, Symmetry454 uses 4:5:4 weeks per month. They all result in 364 systematically distributed days and hence have to add either one extra and one leap day or a leap week.

=== 13-month calendars ===
Some calendar reformers seek to equalize the length of each month in the year. This is often accomplished by creating a calendar that has 13 months of 4 weeks (28 days) each, making 364 days. The earliest known proposal of this type was the Georgian Calendar (1745) by Rev. Hugh Jones.

The Positivist calendar (1849), created by Auguste Comte, was based on a 364-day year which included one or two &quot;blank&quot; days. Each of the 13 months had 28 days and exactly four weeks, and each started on a Monday. The International Fixed Calendar is a more modern descendant of this calendar: invented by Moses B. Cotsworth and financially backed by George Eastman.

Around 1930, one James Colligan invented the Pax Calendar, which avoids off-calendar days by adding a 7-day leap week to the 364-day common year for 71 out of 400 years.

=== Lunisolar calendars ===
Lunisolar calendars usually have 12 or 13 months of 29 or 30 days.

The Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar is a lunisolar calendar proposal which has 12 or 13 lunar months of 29 or 30 days a year, and begins each year near the vernal equinox.

The Meyer–Palmen Solilunar Calendar has 12 lunar months with 29 or 30 days plus a leap month called Meton every 3 or 2 years with 30 or 31 days. 60 years together are called a cycle. It uses a leap cycle which has equal number of days, weeks, months, years and cycles. 2498258 days, 356894 weeks, 84599 months, 6840 years and 114 cycles nearly all equal each other. It is called an era, although time isn&#x27;t divided into it in this calendar.

Some propose to improve leap rules of existing calendars, such as the Hebrew calendar. The Rectified Hebrew calendar uses a more accurate leap cycle of 4366 months per 353-year cycle, with 130 leap years per cycle, and a progressively shorter &quot;molad&quot; interval, intended to replace the 19-year leap cycle and the constant &quot;molad&quot; interval of the traditional fixed arithmetic Hebrew calendar, respectively.

=== Naming ===
Calendar proposals that introduce a thirteenth month or change the Julian-Gregorian system of months often also propose new names for these months. New names have also been proposed for days out of the week cycle (e.g., 365th and leap) and weeks out of the month cycle.

Proposals to change the traditional month and weekday names are less frequent. The Gregorian calendar obtains its names mostly from gods of historical religions (e.g., Thursday from Nordic Thor or March from Roman Mars) or leaders of vanished empires (July and August from the first Caesars), or ordinals that got out of synchronization (September through December, originally seventh through tenth, now ninth through twelfth).

==== Examples ====
Comte&#x27;s Positivist calendar, for example, proposed naming the 13 months in his calendar after figures from religion, literature, philosophy and science. Similarly, the Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar uses 12 or 13 lunar months named after 13 contributors to research on psychoactive plants and chemicals.

=== Specific proposals ===
There have been many specific calendar proposals to replace the Gregorian calendar:

The following count one or more days outside the standard seven-day week:
* International Fixed Calendar
* Invariable Calendar
* Positivist calendar
* World Calendar
* World Season Calendar

The following are leap week calendars:
* Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar
* Pax Calendar
* Symmetry454

There have also been proposals to revise the way years are numbered:
* Anno Lucis
* Holocene calendar

Reform of the Islamic calendar:
* Since the beginning of the 21st century, there is a trend within the Muslim communities of North America and Europe to substitute a lunar calendar based on calculations for the traditional Islamic method of monthly observation of the new moon to declare the beginning of the new month in each country separately.

<doc id="315930" wikidata="Q1628107" url="?curid=315930" title="Airfield traffic pattern">
<text>An airfield traffic pattern is a standard path followed by aircraft when taking off or landing while maintaining visual contact with the airfield.

At an airport, the pattern (or circuit) is a standard path for coordinating air traffic. It differs from &quot;straight-in approaches&quot; and &quot;direct climb-outs&quot; in that an aircraft using a traffic pattern remains close to the airport. Patterns are usually employed at small general aviation (GA) airfields and military airbases. Many large controlled airports avoid the system unless there is GA activity as well as commercial flights. However, some kind of a pattern may be used at airports in some cases such as when an aircraft is required to go around, but this kind of pattern at controlled airports may be very different in form, shape, and purpose to the standard traffic pattern as used at GA airports.

The use of a pattern at airfields is for aviation safety. By using a consistent flight pattern, pilots will know from where to expect other air traffic and be able to see and avoid it. Pilots flying under visual flight rules (VFR) may not be separated by air traffic control, so this consistent predictable pattern is a vital way to keep things orderly. At tower-controlled airports, air traffic control (ATC) may provide traffic advisories for VFR flights on a work-load permitting basis.

== Wind direction ==
Pilots prefer to take off and land facing into the wind. This has the effect of reducing the aircraft&#x27;s speed over the ground (for a given airspeed), thus reducing the length of runway required to perform either maneuver.

An exception to this rule is at airports where the runway is on a severe slope, such as alpine airports (altiports). In these instances, takeoffs are usually made downhill and landings uphill regardless of wind direction with the slope aiding in acceleration and deceleration. Another exception is at airports with mountains at one end.

Many airfields have runways facing a variety of directions. The purpose of this is to provide arriving aircraft with the best runway to land on according to the wind direction. Runway orientation is determined from historical data of the prevailing winds in the area. This is especially important for single-runway airports that do not have the option of a second runway pointed in an alternative direction. A common scenario is to have two runways arranged at or close to 90 degrees to one another, so that aircraft can always find a suitable runway. Almost all runways are reversible, and aircraft use whichever runway in whichever direction is best suited to the wind. In light and variable wind conditions, the direction of the runway in use might change several times during the day, or there may be a preferred “calm wind runway”, possibly because it’s longer.

== Layout ==
Traffic patterns can be defined as left-hand or right-hand according to which way the turns in the pattern are performed. They are usually left-hand turns because most small airplanes are piloted from the left seat (or the senior pilot or pilot-in-command sits in the left seat), and so the pilot has better visibility out the left window. Right-hand patterns will be set up for parallel runways, for noise abatement, or because of ground features (such as terrain, towers, etc.). In the US, the non-standard (i.e. right-hand) patterns are noted in the Airport/Facilities Directory or on a sectional chart; in other countries they may be indicated in that nation&#x27;s similar document, e.g. Canada Flight Supplement. Unless explicitly indicated otherwise, all traffic patterns at non-towered airports are to the left. The direction of the pattern may be indicated by a traffic pattern indicator in the aerodrome&#x27;s signal square.

In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations CFR 91.126 a. (2) requires helicopters to avoid the flow of fixed wing aircraft.

Because the active runway is chosen to meet the wind at the nearest angle (with take-offs and landings upwind), the pattern orientation also depends on wind direction. Patterns are typically rectangular in basic shape, and include the runway along one long side of the rectangle. Each leg of the pattern has a particular name:

* &quot;Upwind leg&quot;. A flight path parallel to and in the direction of the landing runway. It is offset from the runway and opposite the downwind leg.
* &quot;Crosswind leg&quot;. A short climbing flight path at right angles to the departure end of the runway.
* &quot;Downwind leg&quot;. A long level flight path parallel to but in the opposite direction of the landing runway. (Some consider it to have &quot;sub-legs&quot; of early, mid and late. Certainly a plane giving a position report of &quot;mid-downwind&quot; can be visually located easily.)
* &quot;Base leg&quot;. A short descending flight path at right angles to the approach end extended centerline of the landing runway.
* &quot;Final approach&quot;. A descending flight path in the direction of landing along the extended runway centerline from the base leg to the runway. The last section of the final approach is sometimes referred to as &quot;short final&quot;.
* &quot;Departure leg&quot;, &quot;Initial&quot;, or &quot;Climb out&quot;. The climbing flight path along the extended runway centerline which begins at takeoff and continues to at least 1/2 mile beyond the runway&#x27;s departure end and not less than 300 feet below the traffic pattern altitude.

The names of the legs are logical and based on the relative wind as seen looking down a runway facing into the wind. An aircraft flying &quot;upwind&quot; heads into the wind, flying &quot;crosswind&quot; heads across the wind, flying &quot;downwind&quot; heads in the direction of the wind just like blown smoke.

While many airfields operate a completely standard pattern, in other cases it will be modified according to need. For example, military airfields often dispense with the crosswind and base legs, but rather fly these as circular arcs directly joining the upwind and downwind sections.

==Procedures in the pattern==

Aircraft are expected to join and leave the pattern, following the pattern already in use. Sometimes this will be at the discretion of the pilot, while at other times the pilot will be directed by air traffic control.
There are conventions for joining the pattern, used in different jurisdictions.
* In the United States, aircraft usually join the pattern at a 45° angle to the downwind leg and abeam midfield. Although aircraft may legally join the pattern at any point, the AIM and AC 90-66B strongly recommend using a 45° entry at pattern altitude.
* In Canada, aircraft at uncontrolled airports usually cross the airport at midfield at pattern altitude from the upwind side, turning onto the downwind leg. Although joining straight in downwind is also a possibility. At controlled airports, the tower typically directs aircraft to join the downwind leg, base leg, or straight into the final leg.
* In the UK, South Africa, and New Zealand a standard overhead join is recommended.
* In Europe, aircraft usually join the pattern at a 45° angle to the downwind leg, in the beginning of the downwind leg.
* Fast aircraft, for example military jets, may enter the pattern with a run-and-break (in the US, overhead maneuver or overhead break). The aircraft flies at speed along the final leg, and makes a sharp, high-G turn above midfield to lose speed and arrive on the downwind leg at pattern altitude and in landing configuration.

Similarly, there are conventions for departing the pattern.
* In the United States, aircraft usually depart the pattern either straight out along the runway heading, with a 45° turn in the direction of (or against) the crosswind leg, downwind, or with a 45° turn away from downwind.
* In Canada, aircraft usually depart straight out along the runway heading until at circuit altitude, at which point they may turn as desired. At controlled airports, the tower typically gives instructions for what turn to make on departure.

There is also a procedure known as an &quot;orbit&quot;, where an aircraft flies a 360° loop either clockwise or anticlockwise. This is usually to allow greater separation with other traffic ahead in the pattern. This can be the result of a controller&#x27;s instruction. If at the pilot&#x27;s initiative, the pilot will report e.g. &quot;(tail number or flight number) making one left-hand orbit, will advise complete&quot;.

To practice take off and landing, a pilot would often fly many patterns, one after another, from the same runway. Upon each landing, depending on the runway distance remaining, aircraft and pilot capabilities, noise abatement procedures in effect, and air traffic control clearance, the pilot will perform either a &quot;full stop&quot; landing (taxi to the runway beginning for subsequent take-off), a &quot;touch-and-go&quot; (stabilize in the landing roll, reconfigure the aircraft for take-off, and take-off without ever stopping the aircraft), or a &quot;stop-and-go&quot; (decelerate to a stop, then take-off from the remaining runway). In the U.S., when operating in a controlled airport a pilot can be cleared for the option, allowing any of the landing options above, or a rejected landing, at pilot&#x27;s discretion.

==Contra-rotating circuit patterns==

In cases where two or more parallel runways are in operation concurrently, the aircraft operating on the outermost runways are required to perform their patterns in a direction which will not conflict with the other runways. Thus, one runway may be operating with a left-hand pattern direction and the other one will be operating with a right-hand pattern direction.

This allows aircraft to maintain maximum separation during their patterns, however it is important that the aircraft do not stray past the centerline of the runway when joining the final leg, so as to avoid potential collisions. If three or more parallel runways exist, as is the case at Bankstown Airport in Australia, then the middle runway(s) can, for obvious reasons, only be used when either a straight in approach is used or when the aircraft joins the pattern from a very wide base leg.

== Altitudes ==

An aerodrome publishes a &quot;circuit height&quot; or &quot;pattern altitude&quot;, that is, a nominal level above the field at which pilots are required (recommended in the US, FAA AC90-66A Para. 8c) to fly while in the circuit. Unless otherwise specified, the standard recommended pattern height is 1000 ft AGL (above ground level), although a pattern height of 800 ft AGL is common. Helicopters usually fly the pattern at 500 ft AGL. Extreme caution must be exercised by pilots while flying at or through published traffic pattern altitudes as this might contribute to mid-air collisions.

== Visual indicators ==
At airports without an operating control tower, a segmented circle visual indicator system, if installed, is designed to provide traffic pattern information. Usually located in a position affording maximum visibility to pilots in the air and on the ground and providing a centralized location for other elements of the system, the segmented circle consists of the following components: wind direction indicators such as windsocks, landing direction indicators, landing strip indicators, and traffic pattern indicators.

Landing strip indicators are installed in pairs and are used to show the alignment of landing strips. Traffic pattern indicators are arranged in pairs in conjunction with landing strip indicators and used to indicate the direction of turns when there is a variation from the normal left traffic pattern. If there is no segmented circle installed at the airport, traffic pattern indicators may be installed on or near the end of the runway.

== Helicopters ==
Helicopter pilots also prefer to land facing the wind and are often asked to fly a pattern on arrival or departure. Many airfields operate a special pattern for helicopters to take account of their low airspeed. This is usually a mirror image of the fixed-wing pattern, and often at a slightly lower standard height above surface level; as noted above this altitude is usually 500 feet above ground level. However, due to helicopters&#x27; unique maneuverability, helicopter pilots often choose not to enter the pattern, and make a direct approach to the helipad or apron they wish to land on.

==Other patterns==
If an aircraft intending to land must be delayed, the air traffic control (ATC) may decide to place it in a holding pattern until the airport is prepared to permit the landing. Commercial aircraft on hold will generally fly slow, racetrack-shaped patterns which differ considerably from the airfield traffic pattern that will be commenced once the approval has been given to land. Although an aircraft in a holding pattern may similarly circle the airport, ATC may designate a distant location in which to circle.

<doc id="315935" wikidata="Q1734280" url="?curid=315935" title="Karolinska University Hospital">
<text>The Karolinska University Hospital () is a teaching hospital affiliated with Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, with two major sites in the municipalities of Solna and Huddinge. The hospital network is the second largest in Sweden, after Sahlgrenska University Hospital.

The present day Karolinska University Hospital is the result of a 2004 merger between the former Huddinge University Hospital (&quot;Huddinge universitetssjukhus&quot;) in Huddinge, south of Stockholm, and the Karolinska Hospital (&quot;Karolinska sjukhuset&quot;) in Solna, north of Stockholm. The new hospital has about 15,000 employees and 1,340 patient beds. The Karolinska University Hospital is closely affiliated with the Karolinska Institutet. It incorporates the Astrid Lindgren Children&#x27;s hospital in Solna and the Children&#x27;s Hospital in Huddinge.

The old Karolinska University Hospital in Solna (&quot;Gamla Karolinska&quot;) has been replaced by the New Karolinska Solna University Hospital (&quot;Nya Karolinska&quot;). Since 2021, the hospital network has consistently ranked among the top 10 hospitals in the world according to Newsweek. 

== New Karolinska Solna ==
The New Karolinska Solna University Hospital (NKS) (), is the new university hospital built in Solna, Sweden, replacing the old Karolinska University Hospital buildings in Solna.

In April 2008, the decision was made by the Stockholm County Council to build a new university hospital in Stockholm. To construct a new hospital has been considered to be more cost effective, compared to renovating and refurbishing the present facilities, spread over a large area in more than 40 buildings. In June 2008, it was decided that the new university hospital will be built using a public–private partnership 
model which includes also financing as well as management of the building after the completion.

The project, however, was met with controversy, and the process for planning and building the hospital has been heavily criticized for poor construction planning, execution, management and corruption.

The first departments to move into the new hospital building in 2016 were the cardiovascular and pediatric services. All other departments were expected to move into the new hospital building by the end of 2018.

It is one of the most expensive buildings in the world.

<doc id="315938" wikidata="Q304974" url="?curid=315938" title="Numerus clausus">
<text>Numerus clausus (&quot;closed number&quot; in Latin) is one of many methods used to limit the number of students who may study at a university. In many cases, the goal of the &quot;numerus clausus&quot; is simply to limit the number of students to the maximum feasible in some particularly sought-after areas of studies with an intent to keep a constant supply of qualified workforce and thus limit competition. In historical terms however, in some countries, &quot;numerus clausus&quot; policies were religious or racial quotas, both in intent and function.

Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students, at various times, have included: Austria, Canada, Hungary, Imperial Russia, Iraq, Latvia (from 1934 under the Kārlis Ulmanis regime), Netherlands, Poland, Romania, United States, Vichy France, and Yugoslavia among others.

== Historical examples ==
=== Germany ===

A whole series of &quot;numerus clausus&quot; resolutions were adopted in 1929 on the grounds of race, place of origin, or religion. On 25 April 1933, the Nazi government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German non-Aryans, essentially of German Jews enrolling to German high-schools and universities.

=== Hungary ===

The Hungarian &quot;numerus clausus&quot; was introduced in 1920. The law formally placed limits on the number of minority students at universities and legalized corporal punishment. Though the text did not use the term &quot;Jew&quot;, it was nearly the only group overrepresented in higher education. The policy is often seen as the first anti-Jewish act of twentieth century Europe.

Its aim was to restrict the number of Jews to 6 percent, which was their proportion in Hungary at that time; the rate of Jewish students was approximately 15% in the 1910s. In 1928 – also because of the pressure of liberal capital and League of Nations – the act was modified and the passage of the ethnicity quota had been eliminated. In the period of 1938–1945 the anti-Jewish acts were revitalised and eventually much worsened, partly due to German Nazi pressure, and in hope of revising the Treaty of Trianon with the help of Germany.

=== Poland ===
Polish universities were a hotbed of the radical far-right National Democracy and from Poland&#x27;s independence in 1918 right-wing students promoted the return of the Russian &quot;numerus clausus&quot; system. Attempts by the University of Lwów to implement &quot;numerus clausus&quot; in 1922-3 were ruled unconstitutional. In the early 1930s, Camp of Great Poland advocated &quot;numerus nullus&quot; - a complete exclusion of Jews. In 1931, the All-Polish Youth demonstrated against Jewish medical students operating on Christian cadavers. The medical faculties caved in, and Jewish students were supplied with Jewish cadavers. Polish radicals then demanded segregation of Jewish students, first asking for &quot;voluntary&quot; segregation and when this was refused attacking Jewish students. Following violent demonstrations by Polish radicals, in 1937-8 most Polish universities introduced segregation. By 1939, most Polish institutes of higher learning implemented a &quot;numerus clausus&quot; system.

=== USSR ===
Certain scientific and educational institutions in the USSR, such as the MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics implemented anti-Jewish restrictions in the second half of the XX century under the guise of &quot;numerus clausus&quot;. Officially claimed to help promote enrollment of applicants belonging to ethnic minorities underrepresented in Soviet science, such as Yakuts, this policy was effectively used to discriminate Jewish applicants. According to Edward Frenkel, this led to a creation of a strong mathematical community in the advanced mathematics department of Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas, which as a consequence was composed to a significant degree of Jewish students denied entry to the Moscow State University.

=== North America ===

Between 1918 and the 1950s a number of private universities and medical schools in the United States introduced &quot;numerus clausus&quot; policies limiting admissions of students based on their religion or race to certain percentages within the college population. Many minority groups were negatively impacted by these policies; one of the groups affected was Jewish applicants, whose admission to some New England- and New York City-area liberal arts colleges fell significantly between the late 1910s and the mid-1930s. For instance, the admission to Harvard University during that period fell from 27.6% to 17.1% and in Columbia University from 32.7% to 14.6%. Corresponding quotas were introduced in the medical and dental schools resulting during the 1930s in the decline of Jewish students: e.g. in Cornell University School of Medicine from 40% in 1918–22 to 3.57% in 1940–41, in Boston University Medical School from 48.4% in 1929–30 to 12.5% in 1934–35. At Yale University, Dean Milton Winternitz&#x27;s instructions to the admissions office regarding ethnic quotas were very specific: &quot;Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all.&quot; During this period, a notable exception among U. S. medical schools was the medical school of Middlesex University, which had no quotas and many Jewish faculty members and students; school officials believed that antisemitism played a role in the school&#x27;s failure to secure AMA accreditation.

The most common method, employed by 90% of American universities and colleges at the time to identify the &quot;desirable&quot; (native-born, white, Protestant) applicants, was the application form questions about their religious preference, race, and nationality. Other more subtle methods included restrictions on scholarships, rejection of transfer students, and preferences for alumni sons and daughters.

Legacy preference for university admissions was devised in 1925 at Yale University, where the proportional number of Jews in the student body was growing at a rate that became alarming to the school&#x27;s administrators. Prior to that year, Yale had begun to incorporate such amorphous criteria as &#x27;character&#x27; and &#x27;solidity&#x27;, as well as &#x27;physical characteristics&#x27;, into its admissions process as an excuse for screening out Jewish students; but nothing was as effective as legacy preference, which allowed the admissions board to summarily pass over Jews in favor of &#x27;Yale sons of good character and reasonably good record&#x27;, as a 1929 memo phrased it. Other schools, including Harvard, soon began to pursue similar policies for similar reasons, and Jewish students in the Ivy League schools were maintained at a steady 10% through the 1950s. Such policies were gradually discarded during the early 1960s, with Yale being one of the last of the major schools to eliminate the last vestige with the class of 1970 (entering in 1966). While legacy admissions as a way of screening out Jewish students may have ceased, the practice of giving preference to legacies has continued to the present day. In the 1998 book &quot;The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions&quot;, authors William G. Bowen, former Princeton University president, and Derek Bok, former Harvard University president, found &quot;the overall admission rate for legacies was almost twice that for all other candidates&quot;.

The religion preference question was eventually dropped from the admission application forms and noticeable evidence of informal &quot;numerus clausus&quot; policies in the American private universities and medical schools decreased by the 1950s.

Certain Canadian universities had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. McGill University&#x27;s strict quota was the longest, being officially adopted in 1920 up until the late 1960s.

== Modern examples ==

The &quot;numerus clausus&quot; is used in countries and universities where the number of applicants greatly exceeds the number of available places for students. This is the case in many countries of continental Europe. Students in much of Europe choose their field of specialization when they begin university study, unlike students in North America, who specialize later. Fields such as medicine, law, biology, dentistry, pharmacy, psychology and business administration are particularly popular and therefore harder to gain admittance to study.

=== Brazil ===
In November 2002 the Brazilian government passed Federal Law 10.558/2002, known as the &quot;Quota Law&quot;. The law allowed for the establishment of racial quotas at public universities. In 2012 the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil unanimously upheld the law.

=== Germany ===
The &quot;numerus clausus&quot; is used in Germany to address overcrowding at universities. There are local admission restrictions, which are set up for a particular degree program (&quot;&quot;) at the university&#x27;s discretion, and nationwide admission restrictions in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and pharmacy. Not all degree programs restrict admissions. The most common admission criterion is the final grade of the university entrance qualification, that is the high school completion certificate formally allowing the applicant to study at a German university. Typically, this is the &quot;Abitur&quot;. The final grade takes into account the grades of the final exams as well as the course grades. In colloquial usage, &quot;numerus clausus&quot; may also refer to the lowest admitted grade in this process. Other criteria, e.g. interviews, are increasingly common as well.

=== Finland ===

The Finnish system of implementing the &quot;numerus clausus&quot; provides a comparison to the German model. In Germany, the main weight of the student selection lies on the &quot;Abitur&quot; grades (i.e. high school diploma). In Finland, which has a similar nationwide final exam, the matriculation examination (Finnish &quot;ylioppilastutkinto&quot;), the majority of student selections are based on entrance exams. Most degree programs consist of a single major subject and have their own entrance procedures. Nearly all programs have a quota in which the score is calculated solely on the basis of the entrance exam. The written exams usually consist of open-ended questions requiring the applicant to write an essay or solve problems. Multiple choice tests are uncommon.

In fields where the competition for study places is less fierce. This is especially the case with the engineering and natural science programs. It is relatively easy to be accepted in these fields—about one-third of the study places in technology are awarded on the basis of the matriculation exam. The rest of the students are admitted on the basis of an entrance exam. After receiving a study place, the student must accept it in writing on the pain of forfeiting the place. In case the students receive more than one study place, they must select one. During the year, one person may accept only a single study place in an institution of higher education. The system is enforced through a national database on student admissions.

In the Finnish system, the &quot;numerus clausus&quot; is the most important factor limiting student numbers. After gaining entrance, traditionally a student cannot be expelled, pays no tuition, and enjoys a state student benefit. The new legislation, introduced in the summer of 2005, limits the study period to seven years, but it is anticipated that it will be relatively easy to receive permission for a longer study time. No changes to the financial position of the student are currently being considered (as of the summer of 2005).

=== France ===

In France, admission to the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; is obtained by competitive exams with a fixed, limited number of positions each year. Also, at the end of the first year of medical studies in universities, until 2020, there was a competitive exam with a &quot;numerus clausus&quot; for determining which students are allowed to proceed to the second year; in later years of medical studies there is a competitive exam (&quot;concours de l&#x27;internat&quot;) for choosing medical specialties.

=== Ireland ===

&quot;Numerus clausus&quot; is also used in Ireland. University College Dublin uses the system in its admission for Medicine and Veterinary Medicine.

=== Switzerland ===

The introduction of the &quot;numerus clausus&quot; in Switzerland has limited access to medical studies at the universities. At all universities of the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the students need to have a high score on an aptitude test that comprises logical and spatial thinking and text understanding skills.

The universities in the western, French-speaking part of Switzerland did not decide to introduce a &quot;numerus clausus&quot;. Instead, these universities provide unrestricted access to the first-year curriculum in medicine; and the best first-year students are allowed to further their medical studies at the same or at another university. In other popular faculties like psychology or journalism, there are also aptitude tests—but they concern only a single university.

=== United States ===

Starting in the 1980s, and ongoing , there have been allegations of an Asian quota in college admissions, analogous to the earlier Jewish quota.

== Legislation ==
&quot;Numerus clausus&quot; is also used in law, property law in particular, as the principle that the system of estates allows only a limited number of property rights available in a legal system. The &quot;numerus clausus&quot; principle has its roots in Roman law. In German law the &quot;numerus clausus&quot; principle has a constitutional foundation and limits property rights in their number (Typenzwang) and content (Typenfixierung). Other European states show equal doctrines.

== Matters other than education ==

&quot;Numerus clausus&quot; is also a rule that regulates the number of practitioners of a public service in many areas. In the U.S., for instance, it can limit the number of liquor stores to be found in a given geographic area.

In France, it limits the distribution of public notaries geographically and, in effect, limits competition for their services (since their fees are fixed by the state). Notaries handle, for instance, title transactions, which is not allowed to lawyers in France. Similar limitations apply to pharmacists, and to licensed premises for the consumption of strong alcoholic beverages.

In India the system of caste quotas for job placement is enforced, and vigorously defended by strikes and riots.

Often, the rule is administered by the corporation or professional body to which the public servant must adhere, but it is also employed by state entities that have the responsibility for assuring the uniformity of a public service across a national geography.

<doc id="315940" wikidata="Q1267249" url="?curid=315940" title="Go-around">
<text>In aviation, a go-around is an aborted landing of an aircraft that is on final approach or has already touched down. A go-around can either be initiated by the pilot flying or requested by air traffic control for various reasons, such as an unstabilized approach or an obstruction on the runway.

== Etymology ==
The term arises from the traditional use of traffic patterns at airfields. A landing aircraft will first join the traffic pattern/circuit and prepare for landing. If for some reason, the pilot decides not to land, the pilot can simply fly back up to traffic pattern altitude/circuit height, and complete another circuit. The term &quot;go-around&quot; is still used even for modern airliners, though they often do not use traditional traffic patterns/circuits for landing, instead using an airport-specific go-around procedure.

== Reasons for use ==

Initiation of a go-around may be either ordered by air traffic control (normally the local or tower controller in a controlled field) or initiated by the pilot in command of the aircraft for a variety of reasons, such as an unstabilised approach, improperly executed landing (&quot;bounce&quot;), mechanical issue, sudden wind change, unsafe flight condition, or traffic on the runway.

In naval aviation, the term wave-off is used instead of go-around. When touching down on an aircraft carrier, a pilot always initiates a wave-off by applying full thrust as a fail-safe measure. If the plane&#x27;s tail hook fails to catch any of the arrestor cables (known as a (deck) &quot;bolter&quot;) the aircraft can climb again. If the tailhook catches a cable, the aircraft will stop in short order regardless. Conversely, if a wave-off were not initiated and the aircraft were not arrested, it would not have enough power and/or runway to fly off the carrier safely.

Many airlines and aircraft operators state a list of conditions that must be satisfied so that a safe landing can be carried out. If one or more of these conditions cannot be satisfied then a go-around should be considered in some cases and must be carried out in others. This list is usually written in airline or manufacturer&#x27;s operations manual which must be approved by the relevant aviation authority. The operator&#x27;s list of conditions allows pilots to use their individual judgment outside of this scope.

== Procedure ==
When the pilot is instructed or decides to go around, the pilot applies full thrust or a predetermined TOGA (Takeoff and Go Around) thrust to the engine(s), adopts an appropriate climb attitude and airspeed, raises the landing gear when the airplane has achieved a positive climb rate, retracts the flaps as necessary, follows the instructions of the control tower (in controlled airspace), and typically climbs into the traffic pattern or follows the published go-around procedure for another approach. Otherwise, the pilot may elect to divert to an alternate airport or wait while circling over the landing airport for some time, especially if the go-around was initiated by bad weather.

Many modern aircraft, such as most Boeing and Airbus aircraft, have autothrottle/autothrust systems that will set go-around thrust if they are engaged.

On other aircraft, the pilot configures manually for a go-around. In a typical small aircraft, such as those found in general aviation, this might involve:

* Applying go around power (usually full power on normally aspirated engines). 
* Adopting an appropriate climb attitude and airspeed.
* Retracting one stage of flaps if necessary.
* Checking for a positive rate of climb, and raising the landing gear if equipped with retractable landing gear.
* Retracting the flaps fully when the aircraft achieves a certain safe airspeed and altitude.
* Climbing to cleared altitude, or pattern altitude if at a non-towered airfield.
* Advising ATC if go around was pilot initiated, or acknowledging ATC instructions if at a controlled airfield.

==Safety==

Go-arounds occur with an average rate of 1–3 per 1000 approaches. Go-around rates vary between different aircraft operators and operational environments.
A go-around is not an emergency, and may be necessary for a number of reasons. Some of those include; unstable approach, unable to land in the touchdown zone, not in correct configuration, directed by ATC, obstacle on the runway (aircraft, vehicle, animal), or aircraft controllability issues.

Half of commercial jet crashes between 2012 through 2021 occurred during the approach, landing and go-around flight phases. In 2011, 68% (63) of accidents in commercial aviation occurred during these phases of flight.

The lack of go-around decision is the leading risk factor in approach and landing accidents, and it is also the primary cause of runway excursions during landing. Yet, only an estimated 3–5% of unstabilised approaches lead to a go-around. One in ten go-around reports record a potentially hazardous go-around outcome, including exceeded aircraft performance limits or fuel endurance.

A study by Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University on a particular US air carrier conducted to determine predictors of an unstable approach based on conditions at AGL, has shown that factors with the highest correlation were, in order:

# Thrust levers at idle,
# Autothrottle deactivated,
# Speed brakes (air brakes) deployed,
# Glideslope deviation,
# Localizer deviation,
# Flaps not extended,
# Rate of descent deviation, and
# Approach speed (Vref) deviation.
# Incomplete landing checklist

A go-around is a relatively rare maneuver for most commercial pilots. On average, a short-haul pilot may make a go-around once or twice a year, and a long-haul pilot may make one every 2 to 3 years.

Going around carries risks which include:
* Ineffective initiation of go-around can lead to Loss of Control (LOC).
* Failure to maintain control during go-around can lead to LOC, including abnormal contact with the runway, or to Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).
* Failure to fly required track can lead to CFIT or Mid-Air Collision (MAC).
* Failure to maintain traffic separation can lead to MAC.
* Wake turbulence generated may create a hazard to another aircraft that can lead to LOC.

==Baulked landing==

A baulked landing or rejected landing is an unofficial term that usually refer to a very late go-around, initiated when the aircraft is below the prescribed Decision Height or Minimum Descent Altitude or even when the aircraft has touched down. A baulked landing is considered a high risk go-around as the aircraft is typically in a low energy state with low altitude, idle thrust and decelerating airspeed. Additionally, as the aircraft is below the prescribed Decision Height or Minimum Descent Altitude, there is a greater risk of collisions with obstacles and terrain even when following the established missed approach procedure, which may result in Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).

<text>Eaton Socon is a district of St Neots, in the civil parish of St Neots, in the Huntingdonshire district, in the county of Cambridgeshire, England, 1.4 miles south-west of St Neots town centre. Eaton Socon is a component of the town of St Neots, located on its south-west margin. Eaton Socon lies on the west side of the River Great Ouse, and is bounded on the west by the A1 road and on the south by the A428 road (St Neots by-pass). On the north side Duloe Brook delineates the boundary with Eaton Ford, which is also part of St Neots.

Much of Eaton Socon is given over to residential use, but there is a large area dedicated to light industry and trade distribution activities. There are also several public houses and inns, and a retail park.

In the days of stagecoach travel, Eaton Socon was a major stop on the journey from London to the North, with inns providing refreshments and overnight accommodation for travellers, and feed and rest facilities for horses. Some stage coaches diverted through St Neots, but the majority continued on the Great North Road.

Eaton Socon was originally in Bedfordshire but it was merged with St Neots in 1965 and is now in Cambridgeshire. Its housing grew and its population more than doubled: 2,240 in 1931 to 3,264 in 1961, and now (2020) 9,042.

The name Eaton Socon comes from Ea-tun (waterside settlement) and soke (local government area in Norman times).

==Eaton Socon in the present==
Eaton Socon is an area of housing, forming part of St Neots. Lying on the west side of the town, and between the River Great Ouse and the A1 trunk road. It is aligned on the north-south axis, formed by the original Great North Road (now designated B1428). General shopping and travel-to-work patterns have merged over recent decades, so that for many practical purposes Eaton Socon is simply a part of St Neots.

The Little End Industrial Estate is home to a range of light industrial units, at the southern end of Eaton Socon; on the other side of the Great North Road is the Quora Industrial Estate and a retail park. There are three discount supermarkets in this area as well as a large do-it-yourself store and some specialist retail businesses.

Towards the north end of Eaton Socon, there is a medium-sized Co-op supermarket on the Old Great North Road.

Bushmead Primary School is within Eaton Socon.

Just down the Mill Hill and close to nearby Eaton Ford, there is a scout hut, named Eaton Socon Scout Hut, that hosts activities for their scouts and hosts St Neots Children&#x27;s Karate Academy, a branch of karate company Fusion Martial Arts and many more activities.
==History==
===Early history===
There were probably a few scattered settlements around Eaton Socon in the Neolithic period. The first definite record reports that an Anglo-Saxon leader took control of a village near the river near Duloe Brook, and this was called Ea-tun, meaning waterside-village. Another settlement a little further north was called Forda, and later simply Ford.

At this early time, the river was much wider and shallower than nowadays, and in dryer periods it was possible to ford it.

The majority of the population were pagan, and the Pope sent Augustine in 597 AD, to impose Christianity. Augustine&#x27;s work was successful and a hundred years later most of East Anglia was Christian. A mother church was built in Eaton to serve as a focus for a large area on the west bank of the Great Ouse.

===The Norman Conquest===

The local landholder at Eaton at the time of the Norman Conquest was Ulmar, a thegn (or thane) and he was superior to two sokemen; the soke was a subsidiary area of land and control. In time the area became known as Soka de Eton by 1247 AD. In 1645 it was known as Eton cum Soca, and in the nineteenth century this had become Eaton Socon.

The manor of Eaton included two water mills, a church and a priest; there were 38 villein families, seven smallholders and eight tied labourers. The manor of Eaton was allocated at first to Lisois de Moutiers, but by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 it had been transferred to Eudo Dapifer; he was a steward in the Royal household, and therefore an extremely important person, bringing prestige to Eaton.

In this period the Priory at St Neots, at the time still considered part of Eynesbury, was gaining in importance because of the presence of the relics of Saint Neot, an important and famous holy man. Eventually that part of Eynesbury became known as St Neots as a result. At the same time a small religious house was established in Eaton Socon. William of Colmworth and a group of monks, not affiliated to any particular order, was given a site at Bushmead by Hugh de Beauchamp, who had his base in Bedford, in about 1195. After 1215 the site became an Augustinian priory, but it never rivalled the prestige of the St Neots priory.

===Eaton Socon Castle===

Hugh de Beauchamp built a castle in present-day Eaton Socon around 1140. It was probably of timber construction with earthworks and may never have been completed, but the earth mound still exists. It is a Scheduled Monument referred to as The Hillings. The castle was built during a period of civil war over the succession to the throne. Matilda was the heir to King Henry I but a faction of barons supported Stephen. In the civil war that followed several fortified positions were quickly thrown up, in support of Stephen. One of these was Eaton Socon Castle. Stephen&#x27;s supporters won and he was installed as king. When he died in 1154, Matilda&#x27;s son Henry succeeded as King Henry II. One of his first acts was to order the demolition of the castles, which were referred to as adulterine.

Some habitable accommodation must have remained, and was occupied in the 13th century by a Lady Juliana de Beauchamp. Notwithstanding its demolition, the castle and the remaining residential occupation conferred considerable prestige on Eaton. Only an earth mound remains at the present day.

===Turnpikes and stage coaches===
The roads that were adequate for static populations in the sixteenth century were becoming a hindrance to the commercial progress. By 1700 a few turnpikes had been set up: a turnpike was a toll road: the toll income was used to improve and maintain the road surface. The tolls were resented by people who had formerly used the road for nothing.

Eventually local Acts of Parliament were passed to enable turnpike trusts to manage sections of road. In 1725 a Trust was established to manage the Great North Road between Biggleswade and Alconbury.

Improved roads meant more travelling and the number of coaches and carriages passing through St Neots and Eaton Socon increased. It was during the 18th century that road travel reached its zenith, when the stagecoach was introduced. Teams of horses were changed at intervals of 10 or 12 miles, known as &quot;stages&quot;, enabling the coach to keep going, stopping only for the change, and for meal stops. Coaching inns along the line of route arranged the feed and rest of the horses and had them ready at the specified time for the next run by the same coach operator. Overnight accommodation was provided, as in general any long transit took several days, although some coaches continued through the night. Feed for the horses was the largest expense for the operator.

By 1754 coaches were travelling from London as far as Edinburgh. At the height of stagecoach activity there were 20 coaches passing through Eaton Socon daily, &quot;some of them going straight up the Great North Road after changing horses at The White Horse and others taking the loop through St Neots. At The Cross Keys Inn mail was collected as well as passengers&quot;.

The routes converged again at Alconbury Hill with stagecoaches using the Old North Road, the stretch from there to Norman Cross was the busiest length of road in England. Stagecoaches passed along this section at the rate of one every 20 minutes day and night, and the Bell Inn at Stilton, where teams of horses were changed,
had stabling for over 300 horses.

The carriage of goods was by river, and the River Great Ouse was navigable up to Eaton Socon. Some medium distance goods transport was by stage cart, or by pack horse.

===The Cock Inn===
The Cock Inn stood to the north of Eaton Socon Green, between the church and the corner of Peppercorn Lane. It was a large, elegant building of brick with a clay-tiled roof, and double bay windows. It was a well-known hostelry in the 18th century, with a reputation for good food. Lord Torrington, writing in his diary in 1794, was very complimentary about it. His bill came to 9s 10d and consisted of 4s for dinners, 1s 3d for wine, 1s 4d for brandy, 4d for beer and 6d for coffee. There was also 1s 9d for servants and 6d for horses. The Cock was a &quot;posting house&quot;, meaning that horses could be hired there; The Cock was never a stagecoach inn.

The Cock also acted as a meeting place for official business. In a letter recorded in Letters to William Frend, Mr Reynolds of Paxton Hall tells of &quot;a very full meeting of the Commissioners of Biggleswade Turnpike Road at The Cock Inn, Eaton&quot; in 1800, where the builder of Hail Heston bridge was reprimanded &quot;for his neglect in repairing the breach caused by the flood&quot;.

The Cock Inn disappeared some time in the 1920s, although its signboard is said to have survived a few years longer.

===Reference in Nicolas Nickleby===
 In Dickens&#x27; novel Nicolas Nickleby, Squeers and some boys are making their way from London to Yorkshire by stagecoach. They stop at a place named Eton Slocomb, evidently a pseudonym for Eaton Socon:

So the day wore on. At Eton Slocomb there was a coach dinner of which the box, the four front outsides, the one inside, Nicholas, the good-tempered man, and Mr. Squeers partook; while the five little boys were put to thaw by the fire, and regaled with sandwiches. The reference is noted on a blue plaque on the White Horse Public House in Eaton Socon, although there is no presumption that this where Squeers dined.

===The Great North Road in 1794===
John Byng travelled in the county and wrote a description of his travels:

Sandy Field exhibits the same shew of fertility; To the right, upon the hill, amidst woods, stands the new built seat of Mr. Pym; to the left, over the river, the village of Blunham, the beautiful steeple of its church, and the pretty house of Mrs. C---. At mile 51 you enter Tempsford village -- a little thoroughfare; at the end of which are the grounds and house of Sr. G. P. close to the road, foams the wide River Ouse -- now joined by the Ivell.-- As at Sandy there is a Roman, so here is a Danish camp) The village of Wroxston is on the other side of the river; to which there is a Ford passable when the water is down. -- At 52 there is a long bridge over the River Ouze (an excellent spot for fishing) -- At 53 you come to Wyberson village--; Colmworth Church looks loftily to the left. To the right over the river is seen the church of Little Barford, at 54 you pass by a range of houses called Little End.-- At 55 you enter the large village of Eaton; where are several inns, one, The Cock, much frequented by fox hunters, and a noble church.

From the hill above Eaton there is a view of the large market turn of St. Neots in the vale of which join&#x27;d to Eynesbury village makes a great shew: St. Neots Church and steeple, are much admired.-- At Cross Hall, a pretty spot where there is a good public house, The Ram, with a grove of trees, you quit Bedfordshire. At 57 pass the end of Little Paxton village. The high road being adorn&#x27;d by the two good houses of Mr Reynolds and Mr Alexander page.

===Impact of railways===
On 7 August 1850, a railway opened to the public through St Neots: the Great Northern Railway opened its line from a temporary station in London, Maiden Lane, to Peterborough. In succeeding years the company opened throughout from Kings Cross to Doncaster, and railway main lines and branches proliferated.

At St Neots the route taken by the railway lay well to the east of the town, farthest away from the river and from Eaton Socon. The railway enabled the transport of goods and minerals: manufactured goods outward, and heavy commodities inward: coal, lime for improving soil, and cattle feed. Coal in particular: the price of coal often reduced by 80% the day after a town acquired a railway connection. In addition the railway enabled passenger travel in general, and for the first time people of all classes were able to travel, and cheap excursions to seaside resorts were arranged, as well as to the Great Exhibition of 1851.

Unfortunately for Eaton Socon, the rise of the railways led to the extinction of the stagecoach trade that had brought so much prosperity to the area. Long distance stagecoach travel was quickly wiped out, and stagecoach operators ran nothing more than feeder services. Moreover the river traffic too declined steeply; Bedford and St Neots merchants and farmers no longer required river transport for their materials, and employment on the water too was greatly reduced.

Eaton Socon had little industry to fall back on, and from this time it declined. Employment was limited to agriculture, and to the industrial work available in St Neots.

The village has a conservation area centred on listed buildings including modest thatched cottages along the Great North Road and side roads such as Peppercorns Lane and School Lane.

==Post-war development==
The population of Eaton Socon remained without much change until the late 1950s. At this time the Government were concerned about overcrowding and poor accommodation in London, and a number of initiatives grouped under the name London Overspill was implemented. Large-scale increase in housing was planned in Eaton Socon, and this was followed by further schemes in later decades. This resulted in most of the land between the Great North Road and the A1 being infilled. The development was not limited to housing, but included light industry, which was established at first on the Little End estate, and later elsewhere in Eaton Socon.

Following the enactment of the Education Act 1944, there was a great expansion in secondary education for all pupils. It was not until 1960 that a secondary school was established in St Neots, but Eaton Socon was in Bedfordshire, so a number of Eaton Socon pupils travelled daily to Biggleswade. It was only with the establishment of Longsands and Ernulf comprehensive schools in 1966 and 1971 that a full secondary education provision was made in St. Neots.

On 1 April 1965, Huntingdonshire was combined with the Soke of Peterborough to form an enlarged county, named Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough. Eaton Socon was still in Bedfordshire. In 1974 Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough were finally merged with Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely, the entire new county being known as Cambridgeshire. Eaton Socon and Eaton Ford were transferred to Cambridgeshire and Huntingdon District Council, and a St Neots Town Council was set up. Huntingdon District Council later changed its name to Huntingdonshire District Council.

==Amenities==
Eaton Socon slopes down to the west bank of the River Great Ouse. Its weir was constructed in 1967 and has associated lock gates to allow river navigation. The riverbank hosts a large inn, The River Mill Tavern.

The parish church of St Mary the Virgin stands on the picturesque green in the centre of the village.

Great North Road is lined with local businesses. The White Horse pub dates to the 13th century, and was a Royal Mail staging post.

==St Mary&#x27;s church==
St Mary&#x27;s church is the parish church of Eaton Socon.

On the evening of 8 February 1930 the church was substantially destroyed by a fire. By the time it was discovered it had already taken hold, and despite the attendance of Sandy and St Neots fire appliances, most of the timber and other flammable parts of the church were destroyed, as also was one of the bells. The vicar managed to save some of the historic documents and artefacts. In the early afternoon of the following day, the north wall collapsed. An investigation revealed that there had been a defective flue from the stove under the organ chamber. Timber panelling was ignited, and the fire took hold as a result.

The decision was taken to rebuild, and Prof A E Richardson, FRIBA, was appointed consulting architect. The rebuilt church was to be broadly faithful to the original, although detailed photographs proved not to be available. The restoration of the tower was undertaken first, and reinforced concrete was used for strength, and Mr Hartrop, a builder from Eaton Socon, was the contractor, and much other work was done by local people. A new altar was made from a slab of Derbyshire stone, weighing 12 cwt (600 kg).

In due course eight new bells were cast, in part from the metal of the old bells, but forming two more bells than the six former bells. Sir Edward Elgar was asked to compose a chime for striking the hour, but although he agreed, he seems to have been dilatory. However eventually his manuscript was received, but now the Parochial Church Council decided to ask for local compositions. This caused considerable controversy, quite apart from the discourtesy to Elgar, and in fact the chimes composed by S G Wilkinson, the Eaton Socon organist, were used.

Percy Bentham, the stonemason, carved a reference to the conflict in a corbel to the right of the north door: it shows a satyr snatching the pipes from the mouth of a musician.

A statement of expense dated 8 February 1936 shows expenditure of nearly £22,880, of which £18,000 was covered by insurance.

Betjeman later wrote:

Almost completely destroyed by fire in 1930, this church was formerly a 15th century enlargement and completion of a 14th century building famed for its poppy headed pew ends. The reconstruction by Richardson, using local craftsman, is excellent. Since the fire swept from the east, the chancel suffered least and although it was gutted its delicate perpendicular windows were reparable.

The architect of the 1930s reconstruction was Albert Richardson and local craftspeople were employed. Much work on the rebuilding of the church was by Percy George Bentham, including &quot;a rood screen, choir benches, parclose screens, roofing, and the organ case, all in Suffolk oak. The stone carving includes many symbolical corbel groups and portraits. Among the faces are those of the Bishop of St. Albans, the Archdeacon of Bedford, the vicar of Eaton Socon, the churchwardens, the architect, the clerk of the works, and the builders&#x27; foreman.&quot;

==Events==

Traditional May Day celebrations have until recently taken place every year on the green by St Mary&#x27;s church.

==Housing and demography==
Most, 65.8%, of housing is owned (with/without mortgage); the next largest category is 22.5% which is socially rented, including 5.4% from the district council directly. 1.7% of the 2,489 homes had (in 2011) no usual residents.

==Transport==
The Great North Road runs through the centre of Eaton Socon on a south to north axis. As motor traffic developed, this single carriageway thoroughfare became the A1 trunk road. It was not until 1971 that a new dual carriageway was opened, passing Eaton Socon on the west side. This road took over the role of the A1 and the Great North Road in Eaton Socon became classified as B1428.

At present the Great North Road is still the spine of Eaton Socon; traffic calming is much in evidence as it is heavily built up.

The village is connected to Bedford and Cambridge by the daily 905 bus service operated by Stagecoach East.

==Government==
Huntingdonshire District Council, based in Huntingdon, is responsible for most local affairs below County Council level. It collects council tax and administers building regulations, planning and environmental approvals, day centres, assessed housing benefits, parks, refuse collection, a communal leisure budget and supports tourism. District councillors serve four-year terms.

The next tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council, headquartered in Cambridge. This provides county-wide services in road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage. Eaton Socon is in the electoral division &quot;St Neots, Eaton Socon and Eynesbury&quot;, with two councillors.

Eaton Socon is in the Huntingdon Parliamentary constituency, and is represented in the House of Commons by Ben Obese-Jecty, (Conservative).

In 1961 the parish had a population of 3264. On 1 April 1965 the parish was abolished and merged with St Neots, parts also went to Staploe and Roxton.

<text>The airspeed indicator (ASI) or airspeed gauge is a flight instrument indicating the airspeed of an aircraft in kilometres per hour (km/h), knots (kn or kt), miles per hour (MPH) and/or metres per second (m/s). The recommendation by ICAO is to use km/h, however knots (kt) is currently the most used unit. The ASI measures the pressure differential between static pressure from the static port, and total pressure from the pitot tube. This difference in pressure is registered with the ASI pointer on the face of the instrument.

== Colour-coded speeds and ranges ==
The ASI has standard colour-coded markings to indicate safe operation within the limitations of the aircraft. At a glance, the pilot can determine a recommended speed (V speeds) or if speed adjustments are needed. Single and multi-engine aircraft have common markings. For instance, the green arc indicates the normal operating range of the aircraft, from &quot;V&quot;S1 to &quot;V&quot;NO. The white arc indicates the flap operating range, &quot;V&quot;SO to &quot;V&quot;FE, used for approaches and landings. The yellow arc cautions that flight should be conducted in this range only in smooth air, while the red line (&quot;V&quot;NE) at the top of the yellow arc indicates damage or structural failure may result at higher speeds.

The ASI in multi-engine aircraft includes two additional radial markings, one red and one blue, associated with potential engine failure. The radial red line near the bottom of green arc indicates &quot;V&quot;mc, the minimum indicated airspeed at which the aircraft can be controlled with the critical engine inoperative. The radial blue line indicates &quot;V&quot;YSE, the speed for best rate of climb with the critical engine inoperative.

== Operation ==

The ASI is the only flight instrument that uses both the static system and the pitot system. Static pressure enters the ASI case, while total pressure flexes the diaphragm, which is connected to the ASI pointer via mechanical linkage. The pressures are equal when the aircraft is stationary on the ground, and hence shows a reading of zero. When the aircraft is moving forward, air entering the pitot tube is at a greater pressure than the static line, which flexes the diaphragm, moving the pointer. The ASI is checked before takeoff for a zero reading, and during takeoff that it is increasing appropriately.

The pitot tube may become blocked, because of insects, dirt or failure to remove the pitot cover. A blockage will prevent ram air from entering the system. If the pitot opening is blocked, but the drain hole is open, the system pressure will drop to ambient pressure, and the ASI pointer will drop to a zero reading. If both the opening and drain holes are blocked, the ASI will not indicate any change in airspeed. However, the ASI pointer will show altitude changes, as the associated static pressure changes. If both the pitot tube and the static system are blocked, the ASI pointer will read zero. If the static ports are blocked but the pitot tube remains open, the ASI will operate, but
inaccurately.

== Types of airspeeds ==
There are four types of airspeed that can be remembered with the acronym ICE-T. Indicated airspeed (IAS), is read directly off the ASI. It has no correction for air density variations, installation or instrument errors. Calibrated airspeed (CAS) is corrected for installation and instrument errors. Equivalent airspeed (EAS) is calibrated airspeed (CAS) corrected for the compressibility of air at a non-trivial Mach number. True airspeed (TAS) is CAS corrected for altitude and nonstandard temperature. TAS is used for flight planning. TAS increases as altitude increases, as air density decreases. TAS may be determined via a flight computer, such as the E6B. Some ASIs have a TAS ring. Alternatively, a rule of thumb is to add 2 percent to the CAS for every of altitude gained.

== Jet aircraft ==
Jet aircraft do not have &quot;VNO&quot; and &quot;VNE&quot; like piston-engined aircraft, but instead have a maximum operating speed expressed in knots, &quot;VMO&quot; and Mach number, &quot;MMO&quot;. Thus, a pilot of a jet aeroplane needs both an airspeed indicator and a Machmeter, with appropriate red lines. An ASI will include a red-and-white striped pointer, or &quot;barber&#x27;s pole&quot;, that automatically moves to indicate the applicable speed limit at any given time.

== Angle of attack and Lift Reserve Indicators ==
An aeroplane can stall at any speed, so monitoring the ASI alone will not prevent a stall. The critical angle of attack (AOA) determines when an aircraft will stall. For a particular configuration, it is a constant independent of weight, bank angle, temperature, density altitude, and the center of gravity of an aircraft. An AOA indicator provides stall situational awareness as a means for monitoring the onset of the critical AOA. The AOA indicator will show the current AOA and its proximity to the critical AOA.

Similarly, the Lift Reserve Indicator (LRI) provides a measure of the amount of lift being generated. It uses a pressure differential system to provide the pilot with a visual representation of reserve lift available.

<text>Technology transfer (TT), also called transfer of technology (TOT), is the process of transferring (disseminating) technology from the person or organization that owns or holds it to another person or organization, in an attempt to transform inventions and scientific outcomes into new products and services that benefit society. Technology transfer is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) knowledge transfer.

A comprehensive definition of technology transfer today includes the notion of collaborative process as it became clear that global challenges could be resolved only through the development of global solutions. Knowledge and technology transfer plays a crucial role in connecting innovation stakeholders and moving inventions from creators to public and private users.

Intellectual property (IP) is an important instrument of technology transfer, as it establishes an environment conducive to sharing research results and technologies. Analysis in 2003 showed that the context, or environment, and motives of each organization involved will influence the method of technology transfer employed. The motives behind the technology transfer were not necessarily homogenous across organization levels, especially when commercial and government interests are combined. The protection of IP rights enables all parties, including universities and research institutions to ensure ownership of the scientific outcomes of their intellectual activity, and to control the use of IP in accordance with their mission and core values. IP protection gives academic institutions capacity to market their inventions, attract funding, seek industrial partners and assure dissemination of new technologies through means such as licensing or creation of start-ups for the benefit of society.

== In practice ==
Technology transfers may occur between universities, businesses (of any size, ranging from small, medium, to large), governments, across geopolitical borders, both formally and informally, and both openly and secretly. Often it occurs by concerted effort to share skills, knowledge, technologies, manufacturing methods, samples, and facilities among the participants.

While the Technology Transfer process involves many activities, which can be represented in many ways, in reality, technology transfer is a fluid and dynamic process that rarely follows a linear course. Typical steps include:

* Knowledge creation
* Disclosure
* Assessment and evaluation
* IP protection
* Fundraising and technology development
* Marketing
* Commercialization
* Product development, and
* Impact.

Technology transfer aims to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials, or services. It is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) knowledge transfer. Horizontal transfer is the movement of technologies from one area to another.

Transfer of technology is primarily horizontal. Vertical transfer occurs when technologies are moved from applied research centers to research and development departments.

=== Spin-outs ===
Spin-outs are used where the host organization does not have the necessary will, resources, or skills to develop new technology. Often these approaches are associated with raising of venture capital (VC) as a means of funding the development process, a practice common in the United States and the European Union. Research spin-off companies are a popular vehicle of commercialization in Canada, where the rate of licensing of Canadian university research remains far below that of the US. Local venture capital organizations such as the Mid-Atlantic Venture Association (MAVA) also sponsor conferences at which investors assess the potential for commercialization of technology.

Technology brokers are people who discovered how to bridge the emergent worlds and apply scientific concepts or processes to new situations or circumstances. A related term, used almost synonymously, especially in Europe, is &quot;technology valorisation&quot;. While conceptually the practice has been utilized for many years (in ancient times, Archimedes was notable for applying science to practical problems), the present-day volume of research, combined with high-profile failures at Xerox PARC and elsewhere, has led to a focus on the process itself.

Whereas technology transfer can involve the dissemination of highly complex technology from capital-intensive origins to low-capital recipients (and can involve aspects of dependency and fragility of systems), it also can involve appropriate technology, not necessarily high-tech or expensive, that is better disseminated, yielding robustness and independence of systems.

=== Informal promotion ===
Technology transfer is also promoted through informal means, such as at conferences organized by various groups, including the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM), and at &quot;challenge&quot; competitions by organizations such as the Center for Advancing Innovation in Maryland. AUTM represents over 3,100 technology transfer professionals, and more than 800 universities, research centers, hospitals, businesses and government organizations.

The most frequently used informal means of technology transfer are through education, studies, professional exchange of opinions, movement of people, seminars, workshops. .

There are numerous professional associations and TTO Networks enhancing different forms of collaboration among technology managers in order to facilitate this &quot;informal&quot; transfer of best practices and experiences.

In addition to AUTM, other regional and international associations include the Association of European Science and Technology Transfer Professionals (ASTP), the Alliance of Technology Transfer Professionals (ATTP), Licensing Executives Society (LES), Praxis Auril and others. There are also national Technology transfer associations and networks, such as the National Association of Technology Transfer Offices in Mexico (Red OTT Mexico), the Brazilian Forum of Innovation and Technology Transfer Managers (FORTEC), the Alliance of TechTransfer Professionals of the Philippines (AToP), the South African Research and Innovation Management Association (SARIMA), and other associations.

They promote cooperation in technology transfer and the exchange of best practices and experiences among professionals, as today international technology transfer is considered one of the most effective ways to bring people together to find solutions to global problems such as COVID-19, climate change or cyber-attacks.

=== IP policies ===
Universities and research institutions seeking to partner with industry or other organizations can adopt an institutional intellectual property policy for effective intellectual property management and technology transfer. Such policies provide structure, predictability, and a n environment, in which commercialization partners (industrial sponsors, consultants, non-profit organizations, SMEs, governments) and research stakeholders (researchers, technicians, students, visiting researchers, etc.) can access and share knowledge, technology and IP. National IP strategies are measures taken by a government to realize its IP policy objectives.

==Organizations==

A research result may be of scientific and commercial interest, but patents are normally only issued for practical processes, and so someone—not necessarily the researchers—must come up with a specific practical process. Another consideration is commercial value; for example, while there are many ways to accomplish nuclear fusion, the ones of commercial value are those that generate more energy than they require to operate. The process to commercially exploit research varies widely. It can involve licensing agreements or setting up joint ventures and partnerships to share both the risks and rewards of bringing new technologies to market. Other corporate vehicles, e.g. spin-outs, are used where the host organization does not have the necessary will, resources, or skills to develop new technology. Often these approaches are associated with raising of venture capital (VC) as a means of funding the development process. Research spin-off companies are a popular vehicle of commercialization in Canada, where the rate of licensing of Canadian university research remains far below that of the US.

Scholars Jeffrey Stoff and Alex Joske have argued that the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s united front &quot;influence apparatus intersects with or directly supports its global technology transfer apparatus.&quot;

=== Technology transfer offices ===
Many universities and research institutions, and governmental organizations now have an Office of Technology Transfer (TTO, also known as &quot;Tech Transfer&quot; or &quot;TechXfer&quot;) dedicated to identifying research that has potential commercial interest and strategies for how to exploit it. Technology Transfer Offices are usually created within a university in order to manage IP assets of the university, and the transfer of knowledge and technology to industry. Sometimes, their mandate includes any interaction or contractual relation with the private sector, or other responsibilities, depending on the mission of the institutions. Common names for such offices differ. Some examples include Technology Licensing Office (TLO), Technology Management Office, Research Contracts and IP Services Office, Technology Transfer Interface, Industry Liaisons Office, IP and Technology Management Office, and Nucleus of Technological Innovation.

Technology transfer offices may work on behalf of research institutions, governments, and even large multinationals. Where start-ups and spin-outs are the clients, commercial fees are sometimes waived in lieu of an equity stake in the business. As a result of the potential complexity of the technology transfer process, technology transfer organizations are often multidisciplinary, including economists, engineers, lawyers, marketers and scientists. The dynamics of the technology transfer process have attracted attention in their own right, and there are several dedicated societies and journals.

===Technology and Innovation Support Centers===

Technology and Innovation Support Centers (TISCs) help innovators access patent information, scientific and technical literature and search tools and databases and make more effective use of these resources to promote innovation, technology transfer, commercialization and utilization of technologies. The WIPO TISCs program currently supports over 80 countries. WIPO supports its member states in establishing and developing TISCs in universities and other institutions in numerous countries around the world. Services offered by TISCs may include:
* access to online patent and non-patent (scientific and technical) resources and IP-related publications;
* assistance in searching and retrieving technology information;
* training in database search;
* on-demand searches (novelty, state-of-the-art and infringement);
* monitoring technology and competitors;
* basic information on industrial property laws, management and strategy, and technology commercialization and marketing.

=== Science technology parks ===
Science and technology parks (STP) are territories usually affiliated with a university or a research institution, which accommodate and foster the growth of companies based therein through technology transfer and open innovation.

=== Technology incubators ===
Technology business incubators (TBIs) are organizations that help startup companies and individual entrepreneurs develop their businesses by providing a range of services, including training, brokering and financing.

=== IP marketplaces ===
Intellectual Property marketplaces are Internet-based platforms that allow innovators to connect with potential partners and/or clients. For example, online platform WIPO GREEN enable collaborations in specific areas of knowledge transfer and facilitate matchmaking between technology providers and technology seekers.

== Government and intellectual property support ==
There has been a marked increase in technology transfer intermediaries specialized in their field since 1980, stimulated in large part by the Bayh–Dole Act and equivalent legislation in other countries, which provided additional incentives for research exploitation. Due to the increasing focus on technology transfer there are several forms of intermediary institutions at work in this sector, from TTOs to IP &#x27;trolls&#x27; that act outside the Bayh–Dole Act provisions. Due to the risk of exploitation, intellectual property policy, training and systems support for technology transfer by government, research institutes and universities, have been international and regionally-focused organisation, such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the European Union.

=== Partnership intermediaries ===
The U.S. government&#x27;s annual budget funds over $100 billion in research and development activity, which leads to a continuous pipeline of new inventions and technologies from within government laboratories. Through legislation including the Bayh–Dole Act, Congress encourages the private sector to use those technologies with commercial potential through technology transfer mechanisms such as Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, Patent License Agreements, Educational Partnership Agreements, and state/local government partnerships.

The term &quot;partnership intermediary&quot; means an agency of a state or local government—or a nonprofit entity owned, chartered, funded, or operated by or on behalf of a state or local government—that assists, counsels, advises, evaluates, or otherwise cooperates with small business firms; institutions of higher education defined in section 201(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 USC § 1141 [a]); or educational institutions within the meaning of section 2194 of Title 10, United States Code, that need or can make demonstrably productive use of technology-related assistance from a federal laboratory, including state programs receiving funds under cooperative agreements entered into under section 5121 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 USC § 2781).

== During COVID-19 pandemic ==
Technology transfer had a direct impact on contributing to global public health issues, by enabling global access to COVID-19 vaccines. During 2021, vaccine developers concluded over 200 technology transfer agreements. One example was AstraZeneca concluding the licensing and technology transfer agreements on AstraZeneca with the Serum Institute of India and with Daiichi Sankyo of Japan to supply vaccines for COVID-19, which were developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford. In this process Intellectual Property was part of the solution and an important tool for facilitation of affordable global access to COVID 19 treatments – as it was the case in two licensing agreements between Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) and pharmaceutical companies Merck and Pfizer.

== Drawbacks ==
Despite incentives to move research into production, the practical aspects are sometimes difficult to perform in practice. Using DoD technology readiness levels as a criterion (for example), research tends to focus on TRL (technology readiness level) 1–3 while readiness for production tends to focus on TRL 6–7 or higher. Bridging TRL-3 to TRL-6 has proven to be difficult in some organizations. Attempting to rush research (prototypes) into production (fully tested under diverse conditions, reliable, maintainable, etc.) tends to be more costly and time-consuming than expected.

Power political and realpolitik incentives in technology transfer are cognized to be negative factors in destructive applications. Technology transfer to dictatorial regimes is thought to be disruptive for the scientific purposes.

<text>Nordiska Kompaniet (colloquially NK, and literally &quot;The Nordic Company&quot;) is the name of two luxury department stores located in Stockholm and Gothenburg, in Sweden.

The store in Stockholm receives some twelve million visitors annually, with the figure for the store in Gothenburg being about three million and the total number of staff around 1,200. The trademark and the real estate properties in Gothenburg and Stockholm are owned by Hufvudstaden AB, controlled by L E Lundbergföretagen publ (see Fredrik Lundberg).

Nordiska Kompaniet was a founder and remained member of the International Association of department stores from 1928 to 1991.

==History==
The company was founded in Stockholm 1902 through the merger of the two companies K.M. Lundberg and Joseph Leja. The men responsible for the merger were Karl Ludvig Lundberg and Josef Sachs (1872–1949), who wanted to establish a department store that would offer the same level of service as the stores in Paris or London.

On September 21, 1915 the building designed and built especially for the department store was inaugurated on Hamngatan, over the street from the Kungsträdgården park in Stockholm. Ferdinand Boberg, Sweden&#x27;s leading Art Nouveau architect, designed the building. He was influenced by American department stores, giving the structure an internal load-bearing steel structure and an external facade of granite. Ivar Kreuger&#x27;s company Kreuger &amp; Toll was responsible for the actual construction of the building.

In 1934, the company opened a branch store in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

About 1939 NK installed a circular neon sign with a diameter of 7 meters on the Old Stockholm telephone tower. The telephone wires were replaced by underground cabling in the early 20th century and the tower had since been rented by the telephone company for commercial purposes. The sign was constructed by L M Ericsson. One side of the sign features the NK logo in green, the other side a clock in red. It weighs four tons and revolves at four rpm. 

In the 1930s, the company specialized in old-fashioned luxury furniture, which had begun to go out of vogue in Sweden due to changing tastes and living conditions. In 1943, artistic director Lena Larsson, Elias Svedberg and Erik Worts developed the cheaper, more versatile TRIVA line of knock-down furniture, which marked the company&#x27;s pivot to more furniture design. The TRIVA line was similar to IKEA model of ready-to-assemble furniture.

In 1952, the building under the tower was fire-ravaged and the steel tower severely damaged. The neon sign was however not affected by the fire and since 1964 it sits on a custom-designed tower on the NK building&#x27;s roof, 87 meters above street level.

The building was extended in 1961–63 by architect Hans Asplund along the facade on Regeringsgatan. The extension stands on the former lot of Stockholm&#x27;s old electric power plant, which remarkably was the first major work by NK&#x27;s original architect Boberg. In 1971–73 a smaller addition was made by architect Bengt Lindroos when part of the street Smålandsgatan was closed and converted into a building lot. Nordiska Kompaniet (NK) is also the name of the well known design company which produced many popular design commodities in the 20th century.

<doc id="315962" wikidata="Q17071222" url="?curid=315962" title="NetKernel">
<text>NetKernel is a British software company and software platform by the same name that is used for High Performance Computing, Enterprise Application Integration, and Energy Efficient Computation.

It allows developers to cleanly separate code from architecture. It can be used as an application server, embedded in a Java container or employed as a cloud computing platform.

As a platform, it is an implementation of the resource-oriented computing (ROC) abstraction. ROC is a &quot;logical&quot; computing model that resides on top of but is completely isolated from the &quot;physical&quot; realm of code and objects. In ROC, information and services are identified by logical addresses which are resolved to physical endpoints for the duration of a request and then released. Logical indirect addressing results in flexible systems that can be changed while the system is in operation. In NetKernel, the boundary between the logical and physical layers is intermediated by an operation-system caliber microkernel that can perform various transparent optimization.

The idea of using resources to model abstract information stems from the REST architectural style and the World Wide Web. The idea of using a uniform addressing model stems from the Unix operating system. NetKernel can be considered a unification of the Web and Unix implemented as a
software operating system running on a monolithic microkernel within a single computer.

NetKernel was developed by 1060 Research and is offered under a dual open-source software and commercial software license.
==History==
NetKernel was started at Hewlett-Packard Labs in 1999. It was conceived by Dr. Russ Perry, Dr. Royston Sellman and Dr. Peter Rodgers as a general purpose XML operating environment that could address the needs of the exploding interest in XML dialects for intra-industry XML messaging.

Rodgers saw the web as an implementation of a general abstraction which he extrapolated as ROC, but whereas the web is limited to publishing information; he set about conceiving a solution that could perform computation using similar principles. Working in close partnership with co-founder Tony Butterfield, they discovered a method for writing software that could be executed across a logical model, separated from the physical realm of code and objects. Recognising the potential for this approach, they spun out of HP Labs.

Rodgers and Butterfield begun their company as &quot;1060 Research Limited&quot; in Chipping Sodbury, a small market town on the edge of the Cotsolds region of England in 2002, and over a number of years developed the platform that became NetKernel.

In early 2018, 1060 Research announced that it was appointing a new CEO, Charles Radclyffe. Radclyffe announced to the NetKernel community in February 2018 that the team were working on a new platform based on NKEE 6 which would be fully hosted, programmable and accessible via the web - NetKernel Cloud. Radclyffe resigned after six months.

==Concepts==
===Resource===
A &quot;resource&quot; is identifiable information within a computer system. Resources are an abstract notion and they cannot be manipulated directly. When a resource is requested, a concrete, immutable &quot;representation&quot; is provided which captures the current state of the resource. This is directly analogous to the way the World Wide Web functions. On the Web, a URL address identifies a globally accessible resource. When a browser issues a request for the resource it is sent a representation of the resource in the response.

===Addresses===
A resource is identified by an &quot;address&quot; within an &quot;address space&quot;. In NetKernel, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) addresses are used to identify all resources. Unlike the Web, which has a single global address space, NetKernel supports an unlimited number of address spaces and supports relationships between address spaces.

NetKernel supports a variety of URI schemes and introduces new ones specifically applicable to URI addressing within a software system.

===Request===
The fundamental operation in NetKernel is a &quot;resource request&quot;, or &quot;request&quot;. A request consists of a resource URI address and a &quot;verb&quot;.
Supported verbs include SOURCE, SINK, NEW, DELETE, EXISTS and META. Each request is dispatched to a microkernel which resolves the URI address to a physical endpoint and assigns and schedules a thread for processing. When the endpoint completes processing the microkernel returns the response to the initiating client.

==Programming==
The fundamental instruction in NetKernel is a resource request, specified by a URI. Mechanisms that sequence URI requests are located above the microkernel. In the current Java-based implementation, requests are dispatched using a Java API. This implies that any language that can call a Java API can be used to program NetKernel.

, the set of languages supported includes:
* Java
* Ruby
* Scala
* Clojure
* JavaScript
* Python 2
* Groovy
* Beanshell
* PHP
* DPML
* XML related languages such as XQuery
* The URI specification itself has sufficient richness to express a functional programming language.

===Active URI Scheme===

The &quot;active&quot; URI scheme was proposed by Hewlett-Packard as a means to encode a functional program within a URI.
For example, the following URI calls a random number generator
and the following uses an XSLT service to transform an XML document with an XSLT stylesheet:
Because the argument values may be URI addresses themselves, a tree-structured set of function calls can be encoded in a single URI.

===Transports===
Transports are a mechanism used to introduce requests from outside of NetKernel to the NetKernel address space. Transports are available for the HTTP protocol, JMS (Java Message Service), and CRON. Other transports can be easily added as they are independent from the rest of NetKernel.

The role of the transport is to translate an external request based on one protocol into a NetKernel request with a URI and a specific verb (SOURCE, SINK, etc.) and then to send the returned representation back to the client via the supported protocol.

Two mappings are handled by a transport. The first is between the address space of the externally supported protocol to the internal NetKernel address space. And the second is between the verb or action specified externally into a NetKernel verb.

For example, in the case of the HTTP transport, the external address space is a sub-space of a URL. The following mapping illustrates this point.
In addition, the HTTP protocol supports methods such as GET, PUT, HEAD, etc. which are mapped to NetKernel verbs.

===Scripting languages===
A mechanism is needed to issue the URI requests, capture the returned representations, and communicate with clients.

Scripting languages are executed by their runtime engine, which is itself a service. For example, the Groovy language runtime will run a program contained in the file codice_1 with the following:

<doc id="315963" wikidata="Q841258" url="?curid=315963" title="Heading indicator">
<text>The heading indicator (HI), also known as a directional gyro (DG) or direction indicator (DI), is a flight instrument used in an aircraft to inform the pilot of the aircraft&#x27;s heading.

== Use ==
The primary means of establishing the heading in most small aircraft is the magnetic compass, which, however, suffers from several types of errors, including that created by the &quot;dip&quot; or downward slope of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Dip error causes the magnetic compass to read incorrectly whenever the aircraft is in a bank, or during acceleration or deceleration, making it difficult to use in any flight condition other than unaccelerated, perfectly straight and level. To remedy this, the pilot will typically maneuver the airplane with reference to the heading indicator, as the gyroscopic heading indicator is unaffected by dip and acceleration errors. The pilot will periodically reset the heading indicator to the heading shown on the magnetic compass.

== Operation ==
The heading indicator works using a gyroscope, tied by an erection mechanism to the aircraft yawing plane, i. e. the plane defined by the longitudinal and the horizontal axis of the aircraft. As such, any configuration of the aircraft yawing plane that does not match the local Earth horizontal results in an indication error. The heading indicator is arranged such that the gyro axis is used to drive the display, which consists of a circular compass card calibrated in degrees. The gyroscope is spun either electrically, or using filtered air flow from a suction pump (sometimes a pressure pump in high altitude aircraft) driven from the aircraft&#x27;s engine. Because the Earth rotates (ω, 15° per hour, apparent drift), and because of small accumulated errors caused by imperfect balancing of the gyro, the heading indicator will drift over time (real drift), and must be reset using a magnetic compass periodically. The apparent drift is predicted by ω sin Latitude and will thus be greatest over the poles. To counter for the effect of Earth rate drift a latitude nut can be set (on the ground only) which induces a (hopefully equal and opposite) real wander in the gyroscope. Otherwise it would be necessary to manually realign the direction indicator once each ten to fifteen minutes during routine in-flight checks. Failure to do this is a common source of navigation errors among new pilots. Another sort of apparent drift exists in the form of transport wander, caused by the aircraft movement and the convergence of the meridian lines towards the poles. It equals the course change along a great circle (orthodrome) flight path. 
== Variations ==
Some more expensive heading indicators are &quot;slaved&quot; to a magnetic sensor, called a &quot;flux gate&quot;. The flux gate continuously senses the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and a servo mechanism constantly corrects the heading indicator. These &quot;slaved gyros&quot; reduce pilot workload by eliminating the need for manual realignment every ten to fifteen minutes.

The prediction of drift in degrees per hour, is as follows:

Although it is possible to predict the drift, there will be minor variations from this basic model, accounted for by gimbal error (operating the aircraft away from the local horizontal), among others. A common source of error here is the improper setting of the latitude nut (to the opposite hemisphere for example). The table however allows one to gauge whether an indicator is behaving as expected, and as such, is compared with the realignment corrections made with reference to the magnetic compass. Transport wander is an undesirable consequence of apparent drift.

<text>The attitude indicator (AI), also known as the gyro horizon or artificial horizon, is a flight instrument that informs the pilot of the aircraft orientation relative to Earth&#x27;s horizon, and gives an immediate indication of the smallest orientation change. The miniature aircraft and horizon bar mimic the relationship of the aircraft relative to the actual horizon. It is a primary instrument for flight in instrument meteorological conditions.

Attitude is always presented to users in the unit degrees (°). However, inner workings such as sensors, data and calculations may use a mix of degrees and radians, as scientists and engineers may prefer to work with radians.

==History==
Before the advent of aviation, artificial horizons were used in celestial navigation. Proposals of such devices based on gyroscopes, or spinning tops, date back to the 1740s, including the work of John Serson. Later implementations, also known as &quot;bubble horizons&quot;, were based on bubble levels and attached to a sextant. In the 2010s, remnants of an artificial horizon using liquid mercury were recovered from the wreck of HMS &quot;Erebus&quot;.

==Use==

The essential components of the AI include a symbolic miniature aircraft mounted so that it appears to be flying relative to the horizon. An adjustment knob, to account for the pilot&#x27;s line of vision, moves the aircraft up and down to align it against the horizon bar. The top half of the instrument is blue to represent the sky, while the bottom half is brown to represent the ground. The bank index at the top shows the aircraft angle of bank. Reference lines in the middle indicate the degree of pitch, up or down, relative to the horizon.

Most Russian-built aircraft have a somewhat different design. The background display is colored as in a Western instrument, but moves up and down only to indicate pitch. A symbol representing the aircraft (which is fixed in a Western instrument) rolls left or right to indicate bank angle. A proposed hybrid version of the Western and Russian systems would be more intuitive, but has never caught on.

==Operation==
The heart of the AI is a gyroscope (gyro) that spins at high speed, from either an electric motor, or through the action of a stream of air pushing on rotor vanes placed along its periphery. The stream of air is provided by a vacuum system, driven by a vacuum pump, or a venturi. Air passing through the narrowest portion of a venturi has lower air pressure through Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. The gyro is mounted in a double gimbal, which allows the aircraft to pitch and roll as the gyro stays vertically upright. A self-erecting mechanism, actuated by gravity, counteracts any precession due to bearing friction. It may take a few minutes for the erecting mechanism to bring the gyros to a vertical upright position after the aircraft engine is first powered up.

Attitude indicators have mechanisms that keep the instrument level with respect to the direction of gravity. The instrument may develop small errors, in pitch or bank during extended periods of acceleration, deceleration, turns, or due to the earth curving underneath the plane on long trips. To start with, they often have slightly more weight in the bottom, so that when the aircraft is resting on the ground they will hang level and therefore they will be level when started. But once they are started, that pendulous weight in the bottom will not pull them level if they are out of level, but instead its pull will cause the gyro to precess. In order to let the gyro very slowly orient itself to the direction of gravity while in operation, the typical vacuum powered gyro has small pendulums on the rotor casing that partially cover air holes. When the gyro is out of level with respect to the direction of gravity, the pendulums will swing in the direction of gravity and either uncover or cover the holes, such that air is allowed or prevented from jetting out of the holes, and thereby applying a small force to orient the gyro towards the direction of gravity. Electric powered gyros may have different mechanisms to achieve a similar effect.

Older AIs were limited in the amount of pitch or roll that they would tolerate. Exceeding these limits would cause the gyro to tumble as the gyro housing contacted the gimbals, causing a precession force. Preventing this required a caging mechanism to lock the gyro if the pitch exceed 60° and the roll exceeded 100°. Modern AIs do not have this limitation and therefore do not require a caging mechanism.

Attitude indicators are free from most errors, but depending upon the speed with which the erection system functions, there may be a slight nose-up indication during a rapid acceleration and a nose-down indication during a rapid deceleration. There is also a possibility of a small bank angle and pitch error after a 180° turn. These inherent errors are small and correct themselves within a minute or so after returning to straight-and-level flight.

==Flight Director Attitude Indicator==

Attitude indicators are also used on crewed spacecraft and are called Flight Director Attitude Indicators (FDAI), where they indicate the craft&#x27;s yaw angle (nose left or right), pitch (nose up or down), roll, and orbit relative to a fixed-space inertial reference frame from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The FDAI can be configured to use known positions relative to Earth or the stars, so that the engineers, scientists and astronauts can communicate the relative position, attitude, and orbit of the craft.

==Attitude and Heading Reference Systems==
Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRS) are able to provide three-axis information based on ring laser gyroscopes, that can be shared with multiple devices in the aircraft, such as &quot;glass cockpit&quot; primary flight displays (PFDs). Rather than using a spinning gyroscope, modern AHRS use solid-state electronics, low-cost inertial sensors, rate gyros, and magnetometers.

With most AHRS systems, if an aircraft&#x27;s AIs have failed there will be a standby AI located in the center of the instrument panel, where other standby basic instruments such as the airspeed indicator and altimeter are also available. These mostly mechanical standby instruments may remain available even if the electronic flight instruments fail, although the standby attitude indicator may be electrically driven and will, after a short time, fail if its electrical power fails.

==Attitude Direction Indicator==

The Attitude Direction Indicator (ADI), or Flight Director Indicator (FDI), is an AI integrated with a Flight Director System (FDS). The ADI incorporates a computer that receives information from the navigation system, such as the AHRS, and processes this information to provide the pilot with a 3-D flight trajectory cue to maintain a desired path. The cue takes the form of V steering bars. The aircraft is represented by a delta symbol and the pilot flies the aircraft so that the delta symbol is placed within the V steering bars.

<doc id="315973" wikidata="Q1661652" url="?curid=315973" title="Private transport">
<text>Private transport (as opposed to public transport) is the personal or individual use of transportation which are not available for use by the general public, where in theory the user can decide freely on the time and route of transit (&#x27;choice rider&#x27; vs. &#x27;captive rider&#x27;), using vehicles such as: private car, company car, bicycle, dicycle, self-balancing scooter, motorcycle, scooter, aircraft, boat, snowmobile, carriage, horse, etc., or recreational equipment such as roller skates, inline skates, sailboat, sailplane, skateboard etc.

==Definition==
Private transport is in contrast to public transport, and commercial non-public transport. While private transportation may be used alongside nearly all modes of public transportation, private railroad cars are rare (e.g. royal train), although heritage railways are not. Unlike many forms of public transportation, which may be government subsidized or operated by privately owned commercial organizations for mass or general public use, the entire cost of private transportation is born directly or indirectly by the individual user(s). However some scholars argue that it is inaccurate to say that the costs are covered by individual user because big (and often dominant) part of cost of private transportation is the cost of infrastructure on which individual trips rely. They therefore work also with model of quasi-private mobility.

===Personal transport===
Private transportation includes both non-motorized methods of private transit (pedestrians, cyclists, skaters, etc.) and all forms of self-propelled transport vehicles.

====Shared personal transport====

Non-public passenger transport in vehicles owned by the driver or passenger or operated by the driver.

===Commercial transport===

====Shared vehicle fleets without driver====
Self driven transport in vehicles not owned by either the passengers or driver.

====Shared vehicle fleets with driver====

Non-scheduled transit vehicles, taxicabs and rickshaws, which are rented or hired in the short-term on-demand with driver, belong, even if the user can freely decide on the time and route of transit, to the special forms of &#x27;public transport&#x27;.

====Shared individual vehicle journeys====

Means of transport are fixed route and fixed schedule passenger services, for example, excursion riverboats, tourist cable cars, resort ski lifts.

==Usage==
Private transport is the dominant form of transportation in most of the world. In the United States, for example, 86.2% of passenger miles are by passenger vehicles, motorcycles, and trucks.

==Examples of private transport==

* Motorized:
** Automobile
** Motorboat
** Electric bicycle
** Electric skateboard
** Hovercraft
** Moped
** Motorcycle
** Motorized wheelchair
** Private aviation
** Private jet
** Motor ship
** Submarine
** Electric scooter
** Electric unicycle
** Mobility scooter
** SUV
** Pick-up truck
**Limousine
* Non-motorized:
** Bicycle
** Horse-drawn vehicle
** Hot air balloon
** Ice skates
** Inline skates
** Pack animal
** Roller skates 
** Scooter
** Skateboard
** Walking
** Wheelchair

==Sustainability==
Cycling and walking, above all, have been recognized as the most sustainable transport systems. In general, all muscle-driven mobility will have a similar energy efficiency while at the same time being almost emission-free (apart from the exhaled during breathing).

The negative environmental impact of private transport can be alleviated by choosing the optimal modal share for a given environment and transport requirements.

<text>James Francis Cauty (born 19 December 1956), also known as Rockman Rock, is an English artist and musician, best known as one-half of the duo the KLF, co-founder of the Orb and as the man who burnt £1 million.

He is married to artist and musician Alannah Currie, a former member of Thompson Twins.

==Early life and career==
Cauty was born on the Wirral Peninsula. As a 17-year-old artist, he drew a popular &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; poster (and later, a counterpart based on &quot;The Hobbit&quot;) for British retailer Athena.

In 1981–82, Cauty was guitarist in a band called Angels 1–5, who recorded a Peel session on 1 July 1981. Lead vocalist was Cressida Bowyer, whom Cauty later married. He then joined the band Brilliant with which he remained until its break-up in 1986. Cauty was also an original member of Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction, in 1985.

==Artistic partnership with Bill Drummond==
Cauty joined with Bill Drummond to form the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (the JAMs), a collaboration that played out in various guises and media over much of the next decade.

As an A&amp;R man, Drummond had signed Brilliant to WEA. Concocting a scheme for a hip-hop record on New Year&#x27;s Day 1987, Drummond needed a like-minded collaborator with expertise in current music technology, and so contacted Cauty. Drummond later commented that Cauty &quot;knew exactly, to coin a phrase, &#x27;where I was coming from&#x27;&quot;. A week later, the JAMs had recorded their debut single, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;. Several singles and three albums as the JAMs followed (their debut, &quot;1987&quot;; the follow-up, &quot;Who Killed the JAMs?&quot;; and compilation &quot;Shag Times&quot;) before a change of direction saw the duo mutate into dance and ambient music pioneers, the KLF. The duo had their first British number one hit single as the Timelords with the Gary Glitter/Dr. Who novelty-pop mash-up &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot;, claimed to be sung by Cauty&#x27;s 1968 Ford Galaxie American police car. During this period, Cauty also worked with Tony Thorpe of the Moody Boys; besides remix and production work by the Moody Boys for the KLF and vice versa, Thorpe and Cauty recorded the single &quot;Journey into Dubland&quot; together at the KLF&#x27;s Trancentral studios.

The KLF released two albums, &quot;Chill Out&quot; and &quot;The White Room&quot;, and a string of top 5 singles, becoming the biggest selling singles act in the world in 1991. In 1992, suddenly and very publicly, the KLF retired from the music industry and deleted their entire back catalogue.

Drummond and Cauty re-emerged in 1993 as the K Foundation, releasing one limited edition single (&quot;K Cera Cera&quot;) and awarding the £40,000 K Foundation art award for the &quot;worst artist of the year&quot;. In 1994, the duo courted infamy by setting fire to one million pounds in cash on the Scottish island of Jura. In 1995, they undertook a screening tour of a film of the burning, before signing a moratorium on K Foundation activities.

Cauty worked with Drummond again in 1997 with a campaign to &quot;Fuck the Millennium&quot;, the highlight of which was a 23-minute live performance satirising the &quot;pop comeback&quot;, in which Cauty and Drummond appeared as grey-haired pensioners and wheeled around the stage in electric wheelchairs. They returned as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu in 2017, with a novel - &quot;2023: A Trilogy&quot; - and a 3-day festival, &quot;Welcome to the Dark Ages&quot;. Cauty confirmed that the duo&#x27;s work is an ongoing project.

Throughout their career, Drummond has often been the mouthpiece of the group and was sometimes viewed, subjectively, as their chief protagonist. &quot;NME&quot;, for example, wrote: &quot;One suspects that the real boiling genius of the duo is initiated by Drummond. The elements of the K Foundation affair are classic Drummond – honesty mixed with deranged publicity-seeking, pop terrorism ideas mixed with utter strangeness and mysticism..., and a sense that the things pop groups do should be visionary and above all should not be mundane.&quot; However, the initial &quot;idea&quot; for the K Foundation&#x27;s one million incineration was Cauty&#x27;s, although he was beginning to express regret in 1995 at which time Drummond remained resolute.

Contrasting with Drummond&#x27;s image, Jimmy Cauty was perceived, or presented, as &quot;Rockman Rock – cool dude&quot;; the &quot;quiet&quot;, enigmatic one, a &quot;long-haired and quietly spoken chain-smoker: a leather-jacketed misfit [who] has carried his adolescent rock obsession into adulthood&quot;. However, as the previously quoted &quot;NME&quot; piece cautioned, &quot;We can&#x27;t underestimate the importance of Jimmy Cauty&quot;. Cauty was the musical bedrock of The KLF, whether laying down the starting track for &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot;, or playing electric guitar, bass, drums and keyboard on &quot;America: What Time Is Love?&quot;. He and his wife, Cressida, were at the centre of KLF operations, living and working at Trancentral (actually the Cautys&#x27; squat in Stockwell, London) and driving the &quot;JAMsmobile&quot; (Cauty&#x27;s 1968 Ford Galaxie American police car) as their regular, everyday vehicle. Cressida, too, helped out, taking on an organisational role for KLF Communications, in addition to design and choreography work for The KLF, and her own work as an artist.

Engineer Mark Stent recalled Drummond as providing &quot;big concepts and insane ideas&quot;, whereas Cauty - he said - was &quot;literally a musical genius&quot;.

John Higgs wrote in &quot;The KLF: Chaos, Magic and the Band who Burned a Million Pounds&quot; that:
==Ambient house, 1988–1992==
In the late 1980s, Cauty met Alex Paterson and the duo began DJing and producing together as the Orb. Paterson and Cauty&#x27;s first release was a 1988 acid house anthem track, &quot;Tripping on Sunshine&quot; released on the compilation &quot;Eternity Project One&quot;, put together by Paterson&#x27;s childhood friend and Cauty&#x27;s ex-bandmate, Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover. The following year, the Orb released the &quot;Kiss EP&quot;, a four-track EP based on samples from New York City&#x27;s Kiss FM on Paterson and Youth&#x27;s new record label WAU/Mr. Modo Records.

After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as &quot;really shit drum sounds&quot;, the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by &quot;taking the bloody drums away&quot;. Paterson and Cauty began DJing in London and landed a deal in 1989 for the Orb to play the chill-out room at London nightclub Heaven. Resident DJ Paul Oakenfold brought in the duo specifically as ambient DJs for his &quot;The Land of Oz&quot; event at Heaven.

Though initially the Orb&#x27;s Monday night performances had only several &quot;hard-core&quot; followers, their &quot;Chill Out Room&quot; act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay at Heaven to the point that the small room was often packed with around 100 people. The Orb&#x27;s performances became especially popular among weary DJs and clubbers who sought solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb would build up melodies using multitrack recordings linked to multiple record decks and a mixer. They incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and BBC sound effects into their act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as &quot;Sueño Latino&quot;. Most often, they played dub and other chill out music which Bill Drummond described as &quot;Ambient house for the E generation.&quot;

Throughout 1989, Paterson, Cauty, Drummond and Youth developed the musical genre of ambient house through the use of a diverse array of samples and recordings. The culmination of Cauty and Paterson&#x27;s musical work came towards the end of the year when the Orb recorded a session for John Peel on BBC Radio 1. The track, then known as &quot;Loving You&quot;, was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and Minnie Riperton&#x27;s &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;. The Orb changed the title to &quot;A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld&quot;. In 1990, Cauty and Drummond held a chillout party at Trancentral, Cauty&#x27;s squat. A recording of Patersons DJing was made with a view to releasing it as an LP but the mix contained many uncleared samples and other records and was unusable. Later that year Cauty and Drummond went to the isle of Jura, Scotland to record a techno record called Gate. Instead they created a long form ambient film called Waiting (1990). During the same year Cauty and Drummond went into the studio and made the ambient LP &quot;Chill Out&quot;. The &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; suggests &quot;Chill Out&quot; to be the first ambient house album.

When offered an album deal by Big Life, the Orb found themselves at a crossroads. Cauty preferred that albums by the Orb were released on his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure the Orb did not become an offshoot of The KLF. Due to these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name &quot;the Orb&quot;. Cauty removed Paterson&#x27;s contributions from the recordings in progress and released the album as &quot;Space&quot; on KLF Communications.

==Post-KLF==
In 1999 Cauty produced several remixes under the alias &quot;The Scourge of the Earth&quot; for Placebo, Marilyn Manson, Hawkwind, Ian Brown, the Orb, and others. In December 1999 he joined with Guy Pratt, Lloyd Stanton and Denise Palmer to record and release a mobile telephone-themed novelty-pop record &quot;I Wanna 1-2-1 With You&quot; under the name Solid Gold Chartbusters. It was released as competition for the Christmas Number One but only reached Number 62 in the UK Singles Chart.

In 2001, Cauty joined with former collaborators Alex Paterson and Pratt in a London recording studio, together with Dom Beken, an associate of Pratt. Recording later continued in Cauty&#x27;s Brighton studio. In 2003, the group released their first single, &quot;Boom Bang Bombay&quot;, under the name &quot;Custerd&quot;. Subsequently, they settled on the name &quot;Transit Kings&quot;. Cauty left the band in 2004 to work on other projects. Two years later, the Transit Kings released their debut album, &quot;Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God&quot;; Cauty is listed as a composer on seven of the album&#x27;s 12 tracks.

In 2002, Cauty&#x27;s two remixes of U2&#x27;s &quot;New York&quot; were featured as B-sides on the band&#x27;s Electrical Storm single.

==Art==
Cauty was, until mid-2005, part of art/music collective Blacksmoke, together with James Fogarty and manager Keir Jens-Smith.

Cauty works with the L-13 Light Industrial Workshop, London which he explains &quot;is not a gallery, it&#x27;s a support system, spiritual home and technical epicentre for a small group of artists&quot; which includes Billy Childish, Jamie Reid, and Harry Adams. Cauty first worked in conjunction with L-13 on the Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice. Subsequent collaborations included the Riot in a Jam Jar exhibitions and the ADP Riot Tour - is a vast 1:87 scale model in a 40-foot shipping container which tours historic riot sites around the world. L-13 continue to collaborate with Cauty and Drummond, running &quot;dead perch merch&quot;, official merchandise operatives to The JAMs.

Following 2003 media speculation that Saddam Hussein could launch a poison chemical attack on London, Cauty designed the Stamps of Mass Destruction for Blacksmoke Art Collective. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd class stamps featuring the Queen&#x27;s head wearing a gas mask were released as limited edition prints and exhibited at Artrepublic Gallery, Brighton. Following a legal battle over alleged copyright infringement, the stamps were sent to Royal Mail for destruction.

In 2004, Cauty installed a gift shop, &quot;Blackoff&quot;, at the Aquarium Gallery, based on the UK government&#x27;s &quot;Preparing for Emergencies&quot; leaflet. The installation included &quot;terror aware&quot; items, such as &quot;terror tea towels&quot;, &quot;attack hankies&quot; and &quot;bunker-buster jigsaw puzzles&quot; (the latter missing one piece). He commented, &quot;The gift shop becomes the place we can explore our branding ideas, Cash for trash – it represents the futility and the glory of it all.&quot;

In response to the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, Cauty developed Operation Magic Kingdom, a series of images showing US forces in Iraq wearing masks of lovable and friendly Disney characters, adopting the UK&#x27;s &quot;winning hearts and minds&quot; tactics in a bid to gain the confidence of the Iraqi people. In Operation Magic Kingdom &quot;the rules of engagement have been changed to include &#x27;try and be more fun&#x27; before firing.&quot; The images were launched at the Bayswater Road Sunday Art Exhibition, bombed onto billboards and fly-posted across London, as well as being released by The Aquarium as limited edition prints and stamps.

In June 2011 he held a public exhibition at The Aquarium L-13 entitled &quot;A Riot in a Jam Jar&quot; consisting of a series of scale dioramas depicting violent confrontations between British rioters and police, each contained within an inverted glass jar. In 2012, Cauty premiered his short film, Believe the Magic, starring Debbie Harry, Nick Lehan and Branko Tomović, at Tate Modern as part of the annual Merge festival.
The ideas of A Riot in a Jam Jar evolved into the Aftermath Dislocation Principle, shown at the Hoxton Arches in October 2013. The 448-square-foot installation at 1:87 scale (representing approximately one square mile) details the desolate and charred aftermath of what appears to have been a devastating riot. The sculpture, constructed by modifying components of traditional model railway kits, took approximately 8 months to complete includes nearly 3,000 police figures and a soundtrack pitched to match the 1:87 scale. The piece &quot;makes a political statement about societal freedom and state control&quot;. The Aftermath Dislocation principle then toured the Netherlands, being shown at Piet Hein Eek Gallery, Eindhoven (November 2013), Cultuurwerf, Vlissingen (April 2014), and Mediamatic, Amsterdam (July–August 2014).

In 2015, the work was exhibited at Banksy&#x27;s Dismaland and then in London. Following this it was re-engineered to fit inside a 40-foot shipping container and now tours historic riot sites around the world.

In 2014, Cauty released a series of limited edition Smiley Riot Shields. Each are all ex-police riot gear painted over with a yellow smiley face. He originally designed the riot shields in 2012 as a symbol of &quot;non-violent direct action&quot; and as a practical self-protective measure for his step-daughter during the Occupy St Paul&#x27;s eviction.

==Personal life==
Cauty was married to Cressida ( Bowyer), with whom he has twins and a younger son. He later married artist and musician Alannah Currie (formerly of Thompson Twins) in 2011.

<text>The Lewis–Mogridge position, named after David Lewis and Martin J. H. Mogridge, was formulated in 1990 and observes that as more roads are built, more traffic consequently fills these roads. Speed gains from some new roads can disappear within months, if not weeks. Sometimes, new roads help to reduce traffic jams, but, in most cases, the congestion is only shifted to another junction.

The position reads &quot;traffic expands to meet the available road space&quot; (Mogridge, 1990). It is generally referred to as induced demand in the transport literature, and was posited as the &quot;Iron Law of Congestion&quot; by Anthony Downs. It is a special case of Jevons paradox (where the resource in question is traffic capacity), and relates to Marchetti&#x27;s constant (average commute times are similar in widely varying conditions).

Following the position, it is not generally concluded that new roads are never justified but that their development needs to consider the whole traffic system, which means understanding the movement of goods and people in detail as well as the motivation behind the movement.

The position is often used to understand problems caused by private transport such as congested roads in cities and on motorways. It can also be used to explain the success of schemes such as the London congestion charge.

The position, however, is not confined to private transport. Mogridge, a British transport researcher, concluded also that all road investment in a congested urban area will have the effect of reducing the average speed of the transport system as a whole: road and public transport. The relationship and overall equilibria are also known as the &quot;Downs–Thomson paradox&quot;. However, according to Downs, the link between average speeds on public transport and private transport applies only &quot;to regions in which the vast majority of peak-hour commuting is done on rapid transit systems with separate rights of way. Central London is an example, since in 2001 around 85 percent of all morning peak-period commuters into that area used public transit (including 77 percent on separate rights of way) and only 11 percent used private cars. When peak-hour travel equilibrium has been reached between the subway system and the major commuting roads, then the travel time required for any given trip is roughly equal on both modes.&quot;

<doc id="315984" wikidata="Q4923363" url="?curid=315984" title="Blacksmoke">
<text>Blacksmoke (also known as The Blacksmoke Organisation) is an occasional art collective and musical group. Founding members include Jimmy Cauty of The KLF, heavy metal musician James Fogarty, and Keir (ex-manager of The Black Dog and 808 State). Blacksmoke output includes original music, remix and production, compositions for films and TV, as well as photography and video.

== Background ==
Among the work so far produced by the Blacksmoke Organisation are limited edition prints of stamps known as &quot;The Stamps of Mass Destruction&quot; the &quot;Post Terrorist Modernist&quot; EP, and the &quot;Post-Terrorism Xmas Shop&quot;. The anger over 9/11 is immediately apparent in the samples and vocals of many of the original tracks as well as the graphics.

===Stamps of Mass Destruction===
Limited edition prints of first-, second- and third-class stamps featuring the Queen&#x27;s head with a gas mask on. These were exhibited at the artrepublic gallery in Brighton, until they earned the attention of the Royal Mail. All unsold copies of the stamps of mass destruction prints were sent to the Royal Mail for destruction. A second series of the stamps was later released: fourth-, fifth- and sixth-class, which had the Queen&#x27;s head completely engulfed in a chemical warfare protection suit and thus were presumably not subject to the legal action taken by the Royal Mail.

==Musical outputs==

=== 2003 ===
The first Blacksmoke releases were MP3s hosted on the Blacksmoke website, the tracks including &quot;Gimpo Gimpo&quot; and a remix of same entitled &quot;Fuck the Fucking Fuckers&quot;. K Foundation collaborator Gimpo who is organiser of the annual &quot;M25 SPIN&quot; was the inspiration for the track but, contrary to reports, has not provided vocals.

On 23 September 2003, BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Breezeblock with Mary Anne Hobbs show broadcast a 15-minute mix session. The session comprised the MP3s cut together with samples of mobile phones and Big Ben plus other sound effects. The BBC cut the final 3 minutes 30 seconds from the session due to the post Iraq war political climate. The cut material was &quot;Silent Night&quot;, one of the previously available download-only tracks. A few months later, the collective added an MP3 of the Breezeblock version of &quot;Silent Night&quot; to their website for download.

On 5 November 2003 Blacksmoke made available an MP3 EP on their website which they described as &quot;post-terrorist modernism for the Boom Bang Generation&quot;. A Blacksmoke press release drew connections with Bonfire Night and called Guy Fawkes Britain&#x27;s &quot;most notorious terrorist&quot;. The downloadable cover art featured Big Ben exploding like the World Trade Center and asked if the artwork &quot;depicted the destruction of government buildings in Baghdad or Kabul, would we pay any attention?&quot; There were media reports of &quot;outrage&quot;.

===2004 onwards ===
In July 2004 Blacksmoke appeared at The Big Chill festival. Cauty played an eclectic and experimental DJ set, which he described as &quot;an updated version of [The KLF&#x27;s ambient album] &quot;Chill Out&quot;&quot;, while a film by Gimpo called &quot;Docklands Light Railway&quot; was screened. An alternative version of the soundtrack to the film was later featured as an hour-long mix radio session on Resonance FM on 28 August. This was described as an industrial ambient mix.

The Blacksmoke Organisation were commissioned by Disney to rework the original theme tune to their 1960s movie &quot;The Love Bug&quot; for a 2005 remake entitled . Blacksmoke produced two versions, appearing within the movie and on the .

In May 2008 The Blacksmoke Organisation exhibited a new artwork entitled &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot; at the Photo Fictions: New Narrative Photography exhibition, held at the Show Cave Gallery in Los Angeles.

==Remixes==
Blacksmoke have done a number of distinctive remixes of other artists. Some of them have been available for download from their website, others are available on commercial recordings.

<text>Gimpo (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It borders Incheon, with which it shares the South Korean side of the Han River estuary, as well as Seoul and the lesser cities of Paju and Goyang. North Korea is across the Han River. The current mayor is . The city&#x27;s population of more than 300,000 is made up of more than 71,000 households.

Gimpo International Airport (formerly Kimpo International Airport) used to be located inside the city, but is now part of Seoul. Tertiary educational institutions located in the city include Kimpo College and Joong-ang Seungga University. The city has 27 elementary schools, 12 middle schools, and 8 high schools, including Gimpo Foreign Language High School. Three elementary schools, two middle schools, and two high schools are located in the area of Tongjin.

==Modern history==
In 1914, Yangcheon County and Gimpo County were merged. Yangcheon County was separated into two towns (Yangdong and Yangseo).

Kimpo Airfield was constructed in 1939 during the Japanese Imperial period for use by the Imperial Japanese Army. The airfield was a key asset during the Korean War, changing hands three times before being recaptured and held by UN forces in February 1951 for the duration of the war. Designated K-14 by the United States Air Force, it hosted several U.S. fighter, bomber, and reconnaissance units, notably F-86 Sabre which would engage in air combat in MiG Alley in the northwestern part of North Korea.

In 1958, the government decreed that the airfield would serve all commercial flights into Seoul, a role until then filled by Yeouido Airport. After the completion of the terminal at Gimpo, Yeouido was demolished.

In 1963, Yangdong and Yangseo towns were incorporated into Yeongdeungpo District, which includes Gimpo International Airport. In 1973, Gyeyang and Ojeong towns of Bucheon were transferred to Gimpo. In 1989, parts of Gyeyang town were ceded to Incheon, giving Incheon a border with southwestern Seoul. The Geomdan area was transferred to Incheon in 1995.

In 1998, Gimpo was promoted to a city (&quot;si&quot;). A major new development, the Gimpo Han River New Town, was announced in 2003, significantly increasing the population of the city since its construction. A two-car light rail system, the Gimpo Goldline, opened in 2019 to improve transportation to the New Town and to encourage population growth. The line operates between Yangchon station and Gimpo International Airport station, where transfers are available to AREX, Korail, and Seoul Metropolitan Subway services.

==Climate==
Gimpo has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.

<text>Freiberg () is a university and former mining town in Saxony, Germany, with around 41,000 inhabitants. The city lies in the foreland of the Ore Mountains, in the Saxon urbanization axis, which runs along the northern edge of the Elster and Ore Mountains, stretching from Plauen in the southwest via Zwickau, Chemnitz and Freiberg to Dresden in the northeast. It sits on the Freiberger Mulde, a tributary of the Mulde River. It is a &quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot; (large district town), and the administrative seat of &quot;Landkreis Mittelsachsen&quot; (district Central Saxony). Freiberg is connected to Dresden by the S3 line of the Dresden S-Bahn.

The entire historic center of the Silver City is under monument protection, and together with local monuments of mining history such as the &quot;Reiche Zeche&quot; ore mine, it has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Erzgebirge/Krušnohoří Mining Region since 2019 due to its exceptional testimony to the development of mining techniques across many centuries.

Freiberg University of Mining and Technology (&quot;Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg&quot;), founded in 1765, is the oldest university of mining and metallurgy in the world. Until 1969, the town was dominated for around 800 years by the mining and smelting industries. Since then it has restructured into a high technology site in the fields of semiconductor manufacture and solar technology, part of Silicon Saxony.

Freiberg Cathedral is one of the most richly furnished houses of worship in Saxony and contains important works of art such as the tulip pulpit, two Gottfried Silbermann organs, the choir, which was converted into a burial place for the Albertines, and the Golden Gate (&quot;Goldene Pforte&quot;), of which exist three replicas in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Moscow and Budapest.

Freiberg&#x27;s christmas market &quot;Freiberger Christmarkt&quot; is typical for christmas markets in the Ore Mountain region, which are characterized by a strong connection to mining and the typical christmas decorations of this region like &quot;Raachermannel&quot;, &quot;Schwibbögen&quot; and Christmas pyramids.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town lies on the northern declivity of the Ore Mountains, with the majority of the borough west of the Eastern or Freiberger Mulde river. Parts of the town are nestled in the valleys of Münzbach and Goldbach streams. Its centre has an altitude of about (at the railway station). Its lowest point is on Münzbach on the town boundary at ; its highest point is on an old mining tip at . Freiberg lies within a region of old forest clearances, subsequently used by the mining industry which left its mark on the landscape. The town is surrounded to the north, southeast and southwest by woods, and in the other directions by fields and meadows. Since the beginning of the 21st century an urbanised area has gradually developed which is formed by the towns of Nossen, Roßwein, Großschirma, Freiberg and Brand-Erbisdorf. It currently has about 75,000 inhabitants.

Freiberg is located about west-southwest of Dresden, about 31 kilometres east-northeast of Chemnitz, about southeast of Leipzig, about south of Berlin, and about northwest of Prague.

Freiberg lies on a boundary between two variants of the Upper Saxon dialect: the Southeast Meissen dialect (&quot;Südostmeißnisch&quot;) to the east and the South Meissen dialect (&quot;Südmeißnisch&quot;) to the west of the town, both belonging to the five Meissen dialects, as well as just north of the border of the dialect region of &quot;East Erzgebirgisch&quot;.

=== Expansion of the town ===
The nucleus of the town, the former forest village of Christiansdorf lies in the valley of the Münzbach stream. The unwalled town centre grew up on its two slopes and on the ridge to the west. This means &quot;inter alia&quot; that the roads radiating outwards east of the old main road axis (today &quot;Erbische Straße&quot; and &quot;Burgstraße&quot; running from the former Erbisch Gate (&quot;Erbischer Tor&quot;) on &quot;Postplatz&quot; to Freudenstein Castle), some of which run as far as the opposite side of the Münzbach valley, are very steep. The area located east of the main road axis is called &quot;Unterstadt&quot; (&quot;Lower Town&quot;), with its lower market or &quot;Untermarkt&quot;. The western area is the &quot;Oberstadt&quot; (&quot;Upper Town&quot;) where the &quot;Obermarkt&quot; or &quot;Upper Market&quot; is situated. The town centre is surrounded by a green belt running along the old town wall. In the west, this belt, in which the ponds of the &quot;Kreuzteichen&quot; are set, broadens out into an area like a park. Just north of the town centre is Freudenstein Castle as well as the remnants of the town wall with several wall towers and &quot;Schlüsselteich&quot; pond in front of them. The remains of the wall run eastwards, in sections, to the &quot;Donats Tower&quot;. This area is dominated by the historic moat. The southern boundary of the old town is characterised in places by buildings from the &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; period. The B 101 federal road, here called &quot;Wallstraße&quot;, flanks the west of the town centre, the B 173, as &quot;Schillerstraße&quot; and &quot;Hornstraße&quot;, bounds it to the south.

Freiberg&#x27;s north is dominated by the campus of its University of Mining and Technology. The main part of the campus on either side of &quot;Leipziger Straße&quot; (as the B 101 road, the most important transport link in this district) emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. Furthermore, the districts of &quot;Lossnitz&quot;, &quot;Lößnitz &quot; and &quot;Kleinwaltersdorf&quot; are found here, extending almost out to the boundary of the borough. Between &quot;Kleinwaltersdorf&quot; and &quot;Lößnitz&quot; is the &quot;Nonnenwald&quot; wood, and east of &quot;Leipziger Straße&quot; is a trading estate.

=== Surrounding area ===

In the area around Freiberg there are both industrial estates as well as agricultural and recreational areas. Smelting and metalworking firms are based at Muldenhütten and Halsbrücke and paper manufacturers at Weißenborn and Großschirma. Northeast of the town is the recreational area of the Tharandt Forest

The town of Großschirma lies north of Freiberg on the B 101 federal road. To the northeast the municipality of Halsbrücke borders on the territory of Freiberg&#x27;s borough and, to the east, is the municipality of Bobritzsch-Hilbersdorf. The municipality of Weißenborn to the southeast belongs to the &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; of Lichtenberg/Erzgebirge. On the B 101 south of Freiberg is the &quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot; of Brand-Erbisdorf and to the east is the municipality of Oberschöna.

=== Town subdivisions and residential areas ===
==History==
The town was founded around 1168, after a silver discovery led to the first Berggeschrey, and has been a centre of the mining industry in the Ore Mountains for centuries. A symbol of that history is the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, often just known as the Mining Academy (&quot;Bergakademie&quot;), established in 1765 and the oldest extant university of mining and metallurgy in the world. Freiberg also has a notable cathedral containing two famous Gottfried Silbermann organs. There are two other organs made by Gottfried Silbermann in the town – one at the St. Peter&#x27;s Church (&quot;Petrikirche&quot;) and the other one at the St. James&#x27; Church (&quot;Jakobikirche&quot;).

The Renaissance part of Freiberg, built after a fire destroyed the town in 1484, stands under heritage protection.

In 1913, silver mining was discontinued due to the decline in the price of silver. Resumed before the Second World War, mining activities for lead, zinc and tin extraction continued until 1969.

In 1944, a subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp was built outside the town of Freiberg. It housed over 500 female survivors of other camps, including Auschwitz. Altogether 50 or so SS women worked in this camp until its evacuation in April 1945. The female survivors eventually reached Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.

In 1985, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built the Freiberg Germany Temple here because of the large number of members in the region. The building of this temple is considered quite historic by church members given the political climate in Eastern Europe at the time. The Freiberg Germany Temple serves members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from all over Eastern Germany and a majority of Eastern Europe.

On 6 July 2019, the Erzgebirge/Krušnohoří Mining Region including Freiberg was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

=== Regular events ===
Every year in Freiberg the Mining Town Festival (&quot;Bergstadtfest&quot;) is held on the last weekend in June with a procession by the historic Miners&#x27; and Ironworkers&#x27; Guilds, the so-called Miners&#x27; and Ironworkers&#x27; Parade. The Freiberg Christmas Market takes place during Advent, when a so-called &quot;Mettenschicht&quot; is held with a parade by the Miners&#x27; and Ironworkers&#x27; Guilds and the SAXONIA Miners Music Corps. This includes a traditional Sermon on the Mount in St. Peter&#x27;s Church and waiting by the miners on the second Saturday in Advent. Firmly established is the potter&#x27;s gathering on a weekend in the second half of April on the Upper Market (&quot;Obermarkt&quot;). Every year on the &quot;Drei Brüder Schacht&quot; mineshaft in the quarter of Zug there is a model steam engine gathering. Other annual events include the Freiberg Art Award and the election of the Mining Town Queen (&quot;Bergstadt-Königin&quot;).

==Education==
The Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg (Freiberg University of Mining and Technology or Freiberg Mining Academy, University of Technology) was established in 1765 by Prince Franz Xaver, regent of Saxony, based on plans by Friedrich Wilhelm von Oppel and Friedrich Anton von Heynitz, and is the oldest extant university of mining and metallurgy in the world.

<text>Damien Francis Broderick (born 22 April 1944) is an Australian science fiction and popular science writer and editor of some 74 books. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; credits him with the first usage of the term &quot;virtual reality&quot; in science-fiction, in his 1982 novel &quot;The Judas Mandala.&quot;

==Life==

Broderick holds a Ph.D. in Literary Studies from Deakin University, Australia, with a dissertation (&quot;Frozen Music&quot;) comparing the semiotics of scientific, literary, and science fictional textuality. He was for several years a Senior Fellow in the School of Culture and Communication at the University of Melbourne.

Broderick lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife, tax attorney Barbara Lamar. He was the founding science fiction editor of the Australian popular science magazine &quot;Cosmos&quot; from mid-2005 to December 2010.

==Career==
Five of Broderick&#x27;s books have won Ditmar Awards (including the non-SF &quot;Transmitters&quot;, which was given a special award); the first, &quot;The Dreaming Dragons&quot;, was runner-up for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. He has also won the Aurealis award four times. In November 2003, Broderick was awarded a grant for 2004–05 by the Australia Council to write fiction exploring technological singularity. In 2005 he received the Distinguished Scholarship Award of the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts. In 2010, he tied for second place in the juried Theodore Sturgeon Award for best sf short story of 2009, and at the World Science Fiction Convention received the A. Bertram Chandler Memorial Award for 2010.

Broderick&#x27;s best-known works as a futurist and science writer are &quot;The Spike&quot; (1997; revised 2001), a nonfiction book exploring the future of technology, and in particular the concept of the technological singularity; &quot;The Last Mortal Generation&quot; (1999) on the prospect of radically extended youthful longevity; and &quot;Outside the Gates of Science&quot;, on the scientific evidence for some anomalous or paranormal phenomena (2007). A revised and updated edition of &quot;The Spike&quot; was published in 2001 as &quot;The Spike: How Our Lives Are Being Transformed by Rapidly Advancing Technologies&quot;.

His recent critical studies, &quot;x, y, z, t: Dimensions of Science Fiction&quot; (2004), &quot;Ferocious Minds: Polymathy and the New Enlightenment&quot; (2005), and &quot;Unleashing the Strange&quot; (2009) were released by a small US press, Wildside. Several of his books feature cover art by Swedish transhumanist Anders Sandberg, including &quot;Earth is but a Star&quot; (2001), Broderick&#x27;s anthology of science fiction stories, and thematically related critical discussions, concerned with the far future. In 2012, with Paul Di Filippo, he published &quot;Science Fiction: The 101 Best Novels, 1985–2010,&quot; which was short-listed for a 2013 Locus Award.

His most recent novels are the diptych &quot;Godplayers&quot; (2005) (selected in the annual Recommended Reading List from &quot;Locus&quot;), and &quot;K-Machines&quot; (2006) (winner of the 2007 Aurealis Award for year&#x27;s best SF novel), and, with Rory Barnes, a comic &quot;noir&quot; crime novel, &quot;I&#x27;m Dying Here: A Comedy of Bad Manners&quot; (2009), first released in very limited numbers as &quot;I Suppose a Root&#x27;s Out of the Question?&quot; (2007). With his wife, Barbara Lamar, he wrote the near-future sf thriller &quot;Post Mortal Syndrome,&quot; serialised online by &quot;Cosmos&quot; magazine (2007). He edited a book of original essays on the far future, &quot;Year Million&quot; (2008), which was favorably reviewed by &quot;Nature,&quot; the &quot;Wall Street Journal,&quot; etc. In 2010 &quot;Climbing Mount Implausible,&quot; a collection of mostly early stories, interspersed with memoir commentary, appeared from Borgo/Wildside Books, as did (in 2011) &quot;Embarrass My Dog,&quot; a collection of mostly early articles on sex, religion, and politics, framed by commentary recalling life in the 1960s and 1970s.

Broderick has also written radio plays, both adaptations of his own stories (including a 90-minute version of &quot;Transmitters&quot;) and original works. His commissioned drama &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Dog&quot;, first broadcast in 1995, was Australia&#x27;s entry in the Prix Italia; and his novella adaptation of the radio play, published the following year, was selected for Gardner Dozois&#x27; &quot;Year&#x27;s Best Science Fiction&quot; anthology for that year. His work has been translated into French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Danish, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Lithuanian, and Russian.

In 2009, he returned to short fiction, with five stories published in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; magazine, one online at Tor.com, and several others elsewhere. Two of these stories were selected for three 2010 &quot;Year&#x27;s Best&quot; anthologies. Another, &quot;Under the Moons of Venus,&quot; appeared in five 2011 &quot;Year&#x27;s Best&quot; anthologies. The novelette &quot;Walls of Flesh, Bars of Bone&quot;, co-written with Broderick&#x27;s wife Barbara Lamar, appeared in the 2010 anthology &quot;Engineering Infinity&quot;, edited by Jonathan Strahan. &quot;The Beancounter&#x27;s Cat&quot; was selected in Gardner Dozois&#x27; 2012 &quot;Year&#x27;s Best&quot; volume. &quot;This Wind Blowing and this Tide&quot; was reprinted online in &quot;Clarkesworld 100&quot; in 2015.

&quot;Quicken&quot;, a 2013 commissioned sequel to Grand Master Robert Silverberg&#x27;s 1974 novella &quot;Born with the Dead&quot;, appeared with the original work as &quot;Beyond the Doors of Death&quot;. This was selected to close Gardner Dozois&#x27; &quot;2014 Year&#x27;s Best Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot; anthology. In the same year, a comic fantasy &quot;--And Your Little Dog, Too&quot;, written with Rory Barnes, appeared in the short-lived &quot;Omni Reboot&quot;.

Broderick&#x27;s first horror fiction, &quot;The Unheimlich Maneuver&quot;, opened Luis Ortiz&#x27;s original anthology &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Other Paw: Revised Classic Stories of Dread and the Dead&quot; (2014).

<text>Morganucodon (&quot;Glamorgan tooth&quot;) is an early mammaliaform genus that lived from the Late Triassic to the Middle Jurassic. It first appeared about 205 million years ago. Unlike many other early mammaliaforms, &quot;Morganucodon&quot; is well represented by abundant and well preserved (though in the vast majority of cases disarticulated) material. Most of this comes from Glamorgan in Wales (&quot;Morganucodon watsoni&quot;), but fossils have also been found in Yunnan Province in China (&quot;Morganucodon oehleri&quot;) and various parts of Europe and North America. Some closely related animals (&quot;Megazostrodon&quot;) are known from exquisite fossils from South Africa.

The name comes from a Latinization of &quot;Morganuc&quot;, the name for South Glamorgan in the Domesday Book, the county of Wales where it was discovered by Walter Georg Kühne, giving the meaning &quot;Glamorgan tooth&quot;.

== History of discovery ==

In the summer of 1947, fieldwork was done at Duchy Quarry in Glamorgan in southern Wales. Grey conglomerate that formed fissure fill deposits within karstic voids in Carboniferous limestone was extracted. In 1949, Walter Georg Kühne noted the lower cheek tooth of a primitive mammal while examining samples of the rock. He named it &quot;Morganucodon watsoni,&quot; with the genus name being derived from Morganuc, which Kühne stated was the name of South Glamorgan in the Domesday Book, with the species name being in honour of D. M. S. Watson. Additional remains of &quot;M. watsoni&quot; were described by Kühne in 1958. Also in 1958, Kenneth Kermack and Frances Mussett described additional remains from Pant Quarry, about a mile from Duchy Quarry, that had been collected in 1956. In August 1948, an expedition to Lufeng in Yunnan, China yielded a 1 in (2.5 cm) long skull. It was shortly sent to Beijing (then Peking) and then eventually sent out of China, and deposited with Kenneth Kermack at University College London in 1960. The specimen was preliminarily described in 1963 by Harold W. Rigney, who noted the similarity to &quot;Morganucodon&quot; from Britain, and considered it cogeneric, naming the new species &quot;Morganucodon oehleri&quot; in honor of the reverend Edgar T. Oehler, who had originally collected the specimen. In 1978 C. C. Young described &quot;Eozostrodon heikuopengensis&quot; from the Hei Koa Peng locality near Lufeng, based on an associated skull and dentary, as well as a right maxilla and associated dentary. A revision by William A. Clemens in 1979 assigned this species to &quot;Morganucodon,&quot; based on its close similarity to the two previously named species.&quot;&quot; In 1980 Clemens named the species &quot;Morganucodon peyeri&quot;, from isolated teeth found in Late Triassic (Rhaetian) deposits near Hallau, Switzerland, with the species being named after paleontologist Bernhard Peyer. In 1981, Kermack, Mussett and Rigney published an extensive monograph on the skull of &quot;Morganucodon&quot;. In 2016 Percy Butler and Denise Sigogneau-Russell named the species &quot;Morganucodon tardus&quot; from an upper right molar (M34984) collected from the Watton Cliff locality near Eype in Dorset, England, dating to the late Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic. The species being named after the Latin &quot;tardus&quot;, late, in reference to it being the youngest member of the genus.

==Biology==

&quot;Morganucodon&quot; was a small, plantigrade animal. The tail was moderately long. According to Kemp (2005), &quot;the skull was 2–3 cm in length and a presacral body length of about 10 cm [4 inches]. In general appearance, it would have looked like a shrew or mouse&quot;. There is evidence that it had specialized glands used for grooming, which may indicate that, like present day mammals, it had fur.

Like present day mammals of similar size and presumed habit, &quot;Morganucodon&quot; was likely nocturnal and spent the day in a burrow. There is no direct fossil evidence, but several lines of evidence point to a nocturnal bottleneck in the evolution of the mammal class, and almost all modern mammals of similar size to &quot;Morganucodon&quot; are still nocturnal. Likewise, burrowing was widespread both in non-mammalian cynodonts and in primitive mammals. The logics of phylogenetic bracketing would make &quot;Morganucodon&quot; nocturnal and burrowing too. Plant material from the conifer &quot;Hirmeriella&quot; was also found in the fissure fills, indicating &quot;Morganucudon&quot; lived in, or near, a forested area.

The diet appears to have been insects and other small animals, with a preference for hard prey such as beetles. Like most modern mammal insectivores, it grew fairly quickly to adult size. Its eggs were probably small and leathery, a condition still found in monotremes.

The teeth grew in mammalian fashion, with deciduous teeth being replaced by permanent teeth that were retained throughout the rest of the animal&#x27;s life. The combination of rapid growth in juveniles and a toothless stage at infancy strongly suggests that &quot;Morganucodon&quot; raised its young by lactation; indeed, it may have been among the first animals to do so. The molars in the adult had a series of raised humps and edges that fit into each other, allowing for efficient chewing. However, unlike the situation in most later mammals, the upper and lower molars did not occlude properly when they first met; as they wore against each other, however, their shapes were modified by wear to produce a precise fit.

A 2020 study suggests that the metabolism of &quot;Morganucodon&quot; was significantly slower than that of comparably sized modern mammals, and that it had a life-span more similar to that of reptiles, with the oldest specimen having a lifespan of 14 years. Thus it likely did not possess the fully endothermic metabolism seen in current mammals.

== Species ==


==Classification==

&quot;Morganucodon&quot; is the type genus for the order Morganucodonta, a group of generally similar mammaliaforms known from the Late Triassic to Late Jurassic epochs, with one possible member (&quot;Purbeckodon&quot;) dating to the Early Cretaceous. All were small and likely insectivorous. &quot;Morganucodon&quot; is the best preserved and best understood member of Morganucodonta.

There is currently controversy about whether or not to classify &quot;Morganucodon&quot; as a mammal or as a non-mammalian mammaliaform. Some researchers limit the term &quot;mammal&quot; to the crown group mammals, which would not include &quot;Morganucodon&quot; and its relatives. Others, however, define &quot;mammals&quot;, as a group, by the possession of a special, secondarily evolved jaw joint between the dentary and the squamosal bones, which has replaced the primitive one between the articular and quadrate bones in all modern mammalian groups. Under this definition, &quot;Morganucodon&quot; would be a mammal. Nevertheless, its lower jaw retains some of the bones found in its non-mammalian ancestors in a very reduced form rather than being composed solely of the dentary. Furthermore, the primitive reptile-like jaw joint between the articular and quadrate bones, which in modern mammals has moved into the middle ear and become part of the ear ossicles as malleus and incus, is still to be found in &quot;Morganucodon&quot;. &quot;Morganucodon&quot; also suckled (it may have been the earliest animal to do so), had only two sets of teeth and grew rapidly to adult size and stopped growing thereafter, all typical mammalian traits.

<text>Ernest Warlick (July 21, 1932 – November 24, 2012), nicknamed &quot;Big Hoss&quot;, was an American football tight end who played in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the North Carolina Central Eagles.

==Early life and college==
Warlick was born in Washington, D.C. After starring at Ridgeview High School in Hickory, North Carolina, he played college football for the North Carolina Central Eagles.

==Professional career==
Warlick played four seasons with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He then joined the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL) in 1962. He had an average of 17.2 yards per catch with the Bills, while the team earned three straight Eastern Division titles and two AFL championships, and a 20.8 yards per catch average in 1964. In the same season, he helped the Bills win their first AFL championship game against the San Diego Chargers, 20–7, when he caught two passes for 41 yards. In the 1965 AFL championship, when guard Billy Shaw and center Dave Behrman were injured, Warlick helped bolster the Bills offensive blocking in a double tight end offense. In that game, he also scored the first touchdown in the Bills 23–0 victory over the Chargers, on an 18-yard pass from quarterback Jack Kemp.
He was selected to the AFL All-Star game every year he was in the league.

==After football==
He was the first African-American sportscaster on Buffalo television, was elected to the Buffalo Broadcast Pioneers Hall of Fame in 1998, and received the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Distinguished Service Award in 2000. In 2005, Warlick was inducted to North Carolina&#x27;s &quot;Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association Hall of Fame&quot;, honoring his basketball and football accomplishments at &quot;North Carolina Central&quot;.

<text>Queercore (or homocore) is a cultural/social movement that began in the mid-1980s as an offshoot of the punk subculture and a music genre that comes from punk rock. It is distinguished by its discontent with society in general, and specifically society&#x27;s disapproval of the LGBT community. Queercore expresses itself in a DIY style through magazines, music, writing and film.

As a music genre, it may be distinguished by lyrics exploring themes of prejudice and dealing with issues such as sexual identity, gender identity and the rights of the individual; more generally, queercore bands offer a critique of society endemic to their position within it, sometimes in a light-hearted way, sometimes seriously. Musically, many queercore bands originated in the punk scene but the industrial music culture has been influential as well. Queercore groups encompass many genres such as hardcore punk, electropunk, indie rock, power pop, no wave, noise, experimental, industrial and others.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In the early 1980s, several U.S. hardcore bands wrote queer-themed songs, and Gary Floyd of the Dicks along with Randy Turner of Big Boys were notable in both being openly gay and outspoken gay men. In England, in the anarcho-punk scene, Andy Martin of The Apostles was equally forthright. Politically motivated U.S. bands such as MDC and 7 Seconds also introduced anti-homophobia messages into their songs at this time, while the Nip Drivers included a song titled &quot;Quentin&quot;, dedicated to Quentin Crisp, in their repertoire.

The zine &quot;J.D.s&quot;, created by G.B. Jones and Bruce LaBruce, is widely acknowledged as being the zine which launched the movement. &quot;&quot;J.D.s&quot; is seen by many to be the catalyst that pushed the queercore scene into existence&quot;, writes Amy Spencer in &quot;DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture&quot;. Emerging out of the anarchist scene, at first the editors of &quot;J.D.s&quot; had chosen the appellation &quot;homocore&quot; to describe the movement but replaced the word &quot;homo&quot; with queer to better reflect the diversity of those involved, as well as to disassociate themselves completely from the confines of gay and lesbian orthodoxy.

The first issue was released in 1985, with a manifesto entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Gay&quot; published in the fanzine &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot; following soon after; inspiring, among many other zines, &quot;Holy Titclamps&quot;, edited by Larry-bob, &quot;Homocore&quot; by Tom Jennings and Deke Nihilson, Donna Dresch&#x27;s &quot;Chainsaw&quot;, and &quot;Outpunk&quot; by Matt Wobensmith, these last two later functioning as music labels. These zines, and the movement, are characterised by an alternative to the self-imposed ghettoization of orthodox gay men and lesbians; sexual and gender diversity in opposition to the segregation practiced by the mainstream gay community; a dissatisfaction with a consumerist culture, proposing a DIY ethos in its place in order to create a culture of its own; and opposition to oppressive religious tenets and political repression.

=== 1990s ===

In 1990, the &quot;J.D.s&quot; editors released the first queercore compilation, &quot;J.D.s Top Ten Homocore Hit Parade Tape&quot;, a cassette which included bands from Canada, such as Fifth Column, Big Man, and Bomb from the U.S.; from England, The Apostles, Academy 23 and No Brain Cell; and, from New Zealand, Gorse.

During the period from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, many of the punk rock bands involved in queercore were not necessarily queer but their ethics were motivation for supporting this movement. Other bands, such as Los Crudos and Go!, had one outspoken member who was homosexual.

Other early queercore bands included Anti-Scrunti Faction, who appeared in &quot;J.D.s&quot;, and Comrades In Arms, &quot;Homocore&quot; editor Deke Nihilson&#x27;s band. Shortly after the release of the tape &quot;J.D.s&quot; ceased publication and a new crop of zines arose, such as &quot;Jane and Frankie&quot; by Klaus and Jena von Brücker, &quot;Shrimp&quot; by Vaginal Davis and &quot;Fanorama&quot; by REB. The zine BIMBOX published statements such as &quot;You are entering a gay and lesbian-free zone...Effective immediately, BIMBOX is at war against lesbians and gays. A war in which modern queer boys and girls are united against the prehistoric thinking and demented self-serving politics of the above-mentioned scum.&quot;

The first queer zine gathering occurred at this time; &quot;Spew&quot;, held in Chicago in 1991, offered an opportunity for all those involved in the scene to meet. Although organizer Steve LaFreniere was stabbed outside the venue at the end of the night, he quickly recovered and the event was deemed a success. Spew 2 took place in Los Angeles in 1992, and Spew III in Toronto in 1993. These Spew events also included musical performances by queercore bands.

Among the better-known bands from the early 1990s are Fifth Column; God Is My Co-Pilot; Pansy Division; Pedro, Muriel and Esther (PME); Sister George; Team Dresch; Tribe 8; and Mukilteo Fairies. As these bands gained popularity and awareness of the movement grew, zines began appearing from around the world; &quot;The Burning Times&quot; from Australia, and &quot;P.M.S.&quot; from the UK are examples.

In Chicago, Mark Freitas and Joanna Brown organized a monthly &quot;Homocore&quot; night that featured queercore bands performing live, offering a stable venue for the scene to proliferate; most of the bands mentioned played at &quot;Homocore Chicago&quot;. As well, as Amy Spencer notes in &quot;DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture&quot;, &quot;Through Homocore events, they aimed to create a space for men and women to be together, as opposed to the sense of gender segregation which was the norm in mainstream gay culture – They attacked the idea that due to your sexuality you should be offered only one choice of social scene...&quot;

In 1992 Matt Wobensmith&#x27;s zine &quot;Outpunk&quot; also became a record label, and began to release its own queercore compilations, singles, and albums, and was crucial to the development of queercore. The first recordings by Tribe 8 and Pansy Division were released by the label. Some of the bands appearing later in the mid-1990s on the label include Sta-Prest, Cypher in the Snow and Behead the Prophet, No Lord Shall Live. It was also at this time in the early 1990s that Riot Grrrl emerged. Both groups deviated from the oppressive homonormative tendencies. &quot;In many ways the angry- girl genre owes its existence to punk homocore &#x27;zines...&quot; writes Emily White in &quot;Rock She Wrote&quot;. It follows that many of the participants, their zines, and bands like Excuse 17 were involved in both movements. Along with Outpunk, independent record labels such as Alternative Tentacles, K Records, Kill Rock Stars, Lookout! Records, Yoyo Recordings and Candy Ass Records also supported and released material by queercore artists but in the mid to late 1990s several other small labels, alongside Outpunk, sprung up solely devoted to queercore.

Donna Dresch&#x27;s zine &quot;Chainsaw&quot; became a record label as well, and began to release recordings by newer bands such as The Need, The Third Sex and Longstocking. Heartcore Records is another label, whose bands have included The Little Deaths, Addicted2Fiction, Crowns On 45 and Ninja Death Squad. These bands, many of whom are no longer together, constituted the &#x27;second wave&#x27; of queercore bands which also included IAMLoved, Subtonix, Best Revenge, prettypony, and Fagatron from the U.S., Skinjobs from Canada and, from Italy, Pussy Face. Of these early queercore labels, Chainsaw and Heartcore are still active and are still releasing new material.

By the mid-1990s, zines in the U.S., such as &quot;Marilyn Medusa&quot;, and in Canada, Scott Treleaven&#x27;s &quot;This Is The Salivation Army&quot;, began to link queercore with Paganism; at the same time, other strands in queercore began to link themselves with Riot Grrrl, and still others with anarchism. Mainstream media coverage intensified when Pansy Division toured the U.S. with Green Day (whose lead singer, Billie Joe Armstrong, is openly bisexual). In 1996 in San Francisco, the Dirtybird 96 Queercore Festival presaged other queer music gatherings which occurred in the following decade. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, DUMBA provided an ongoing venue in New York City for queercore bands, continuing in the path of Homocore Chicago and leading the way for other, similar clubs to come in the 2000s.

=== 2000s ===
In the 2000s, queercore club nights and events continued to take place throughout Europe and North America. In Los Angeles&#x27; Silver Lake neighbourhood an underground queer music scene was in existence at the monthly queercore club called &quot;The Freak Show&quot; hosted by the leather bar The Gauntlet II for three years, where bands such as Best Revenge, IAMLoved, and Nick Name and The Normals (aka Kent James) played regularly. In Toronto, the queercore scene thrived for a number of years at the monthly club Vazaleen, or Club V, run by Will Munro, which featured bands from across the U.S. and Canada, including such legendary performers as Jayne County. The festival Queer Panic was organized by Gordon Gordon of the zine Teen Fag in Seattle, Washington in June 2000. Scutterfest was organized by Rudy Bleu of the zine Scutter in Los Angeles, California in 2001, 2002, and 2003. The Bent Festival was held in Seattle in 2002 and 2003.

The festival &quot;Homo-a-go-go&quot; was held the summers of 2002, 2004 and 2006 in Olympia, Washington, featuring queer films, zines, performance and musical groups during the week-long event; in 2009 the festival was held in San Francisco.

&quot;Queeruption&quot;, which takes place in a different city each year, has been hosted by Berlin, Rome, New York and London in the past. In 2004 and 2005, a group of queercore bands toured throughout the U.S.; the tour was called &quot;Queercore Blitz&quot; and was yet another way to connect the like-minded. Queer groups active in the UK included Edinburgh QueerMutiny, Queers Without Borders, Queer Mutiny North, Cardiff Queer Mutiny and Queer Mutiny Brighton. A number of these are organised as Queer Mutiny groups.

In 2002, Agitprop! Records released a compilation titled &quot;Stand Up &amp; Fucking Fight For It&quot;, which collected new music from queercore bands. It was the first release from the label, which features many queercore acts in its roster. 16 records is a queercore label that releases albums by such Pacific Northwest bands as Shemo, The Haggard, and Swan Island, as well as the Brazilian band Dominatrix. Other new labels include Queer Control, which features the bands Pariah Piranha, Tough Tough Skin, Nancy Fullforce, Once A Pawn, and others.

In September 2005, &quot;Homocore: The Loud and Raucous Rise of Queer Rock&quot; by David Ciminelli and Ken Knox was published by Alyson Books. It traced the history of the movement in the 1990s in the United States, and included interviews with some of the contemporary musicians who have been inspired by it. Queercore became an increasingly international phenomenon in the early 2000s, with bands such as Low End Models, Triple Creme from NYC, and Rhythm King And Her Friends from Germany, Kids Like Us out of Norway and She Devils, from Argentina. From Toronto, Canada came Kids on TV, whose industrial background offered a new, more electronic direction for queercore. Similar electronic instrumentation was explored by Lesbians on Ecstasy from Montreal. Canada also birthed The Hidden Cameras, an anti-folk band from Toronto and Eekum Seekum, a queercore band from Halifax.

The 2000s also brought a new crop of bands to prominence in the United States. The band Limp Wrist represent a contemporary breed of hardcore punk. Butch Vs Femme, formed in 2004, are a riot grrrl inspired indie punk keyboard and drums duo originally from the small town of Dixon, California, saturated with politically powered lyrics surrounding queer issues. Gravy Train!!!!, a raucous electropop band from Oakland, California, known for their sexually explicit lyrics and onstage antics, has released several albums on Kill Rock Stars label. One offshoot of Gravy Train!!!!, Hunx and His Punx, are a power pop act more indebted to girl groups and 1960s garage rock. Three Dollar Bill from Chicago are an eclectic band whose sound ranges from punk to indie rock to metal. Three Dollar Puta was a synth punk queer core band from Los Angeles. Also citing metal as an inspiration are ASSACRE, a one man fantasy metal/spazz noise act by artist Ben Aqua from Austin, Texas, and Gay for Johnny Depp, a hardcore band from New York City.

The Shondes, a four piece rock band from Brooklyn combine riot grrrl punk with classical and traditional Jewish music influences; similarly, Schmekel, an all-transgender, all-Jewish Brooklyn band combines punk rock with klezmer. The Homewreckers are a riot grrrl / pop-punk band, also based in Brooklyn. Your Heart Breaks are a multi-instrumental low-fi band with a fluctuating line-up based in Seattle, Washington. Along with these new bands, queercore pioneers Team Dresch reunited in the mid-2000s for several tours. The underground Chicago DIY punk scene remains a safe haven for queercore artists to flourish and share their art. FED UP fest is a yearly three-day festival of music, zines, and workshops which celebrate queer culture in the punk community. It also serves as a benefit project for PROJECT FIERCE CHICAGO which aims to reduce the number of LGBTQ youth who are homeless through transitional housing and support services.

In the UK there was a burgeoning queercore scene, fuelled by aforementioned groups such as Queer Mutiny, Homocrime, and record labels such as Local Kid arranging shows and releasing records by bands and artists such as Corey Orbison, Sleeping States, Drunk Granny, Little Paper Squares, Husbands, Fake Tan and Lianne Hall. These bands all combine elements of the DIY culture that spurred queercore and the punk sensibility, as seen in two of Manchester&#x27;s offerings, the lesbian disco-punk band Vile Vile Creatures and solo lo-fi electro-punk-popster Ste McCabe (whose previous band Stephen Nancy were considered a major reference for UK queercore in the early 2000s). Music historian Julia Downes additionally identified the following artists and bands in an overview of UK queercore music circa 2003-2009: Candy Panic Attack, Chaps, Flamingo 50, Headfall, hooker [now LIINES], Hotpants Romance, Humousexual, Lake Me, Lesbo Pig, Robin Osterley, Roseanne Barrr, Sad Shields, Sailor Tongue, Scragfight, The Battys, the Jelas, the Rayographs, Trash Kit, Truly Kaput, Valerie and Wetdog. Members of these bands later played in Electrelane, Shopping, Dream Nails and others.

Club-wise, Psycho:Drama in Bristol was a passionate advocate of queercore and maintained a presence for alternative queer youth in the city for over 4 years. Collectives in the North West of England such as Manifesta, and Lola and the Cartwheels, promoted and organised alternative queer events whilst simultaneously having a strong feminist identity.

=== 2010s ===
In the UK, record label Tuff Enuff Records was formed in 2012 from Brighton &quot;queer/riot grrrl/DIY&quot; club night &quot;Riots Not Diets&quot; and focused on releases by queer-identifying bands. Elsewhere, events such as &quot;Pussy Whipped&quot; (Manchester, and later, Edinburgh) and &quot;Queer Riot&quot; (London) provided a space for like-minded artists, and since 2015, annual festivals &quot;Queer We Go&quot; (aka Queerfest) and &quot;Bentfest&quot; have been organised in Leeds and London. Bands in the post-punk, riot grrrl and indiepop genres continue to be associated with queercore including Dazey and the Scouts, Shopping, Wolf Girl, Martha, ONSIND, Colour Me Wednesday and Guttfull.

In the US, the 2017 book &quot;Queercore: Queer Punk Media Subculture&quot; by Curran Nault brought renewed attention to queercore via a historical overview and theoretical exploration of the homology between queer theory/practice and punk theory/practice at the heart of queercore mediamaking. Retrospective documentary &quot;&quot;, directed by Yony Leyser was released the same year. An oral history put together from the transcripts of the film as well as additional interviews called &quot;Queercore: How to Punk a Revolution: An Oral History&quot; by Liam Warfield, Walter Crasshole and Leyser was released by PM Press in 2021.

== Film ==
Filmmakers such as Kenneth Anger, Ron Rice, Jack Smith, early Andy Warhol and early John Waters, Vivienne Dick and the aforementioned Derek Jarman were influential in their depictions of queer subcultures. In 1990 the editors of &quot;J.D.s&quot; began presenting &quot;J.D.s&quot; movie nights in various cities showing films such as Bruce LaBruce&#x27;s &quot;Boy, Girl&quot; and &quot;Bruce and Pepper Wayne Gacy&#x27;s Home Movies&quot;, and G.B. Jones&#x27; &quot;The Troublemakers&quot;; after the demise of &quot;J.D.s&quot;, each made films exploring the queercore milieu; LaBruce released the feature length &quot;No Skin Off My Ass&quot; in 1991; G.B. Jones&#x27; &quot;The Troublemakers&quot; was released in 1990, followed by &quot;The Yo-Yo Gang&quot; in 1992. In 1996, &quot;J.D.s&quot; contributor Anonymous Boy completed the first animated queercore film, &quot;Green Pubes&quot;.

Documentary films about queercore include the 1996 releases &quot;She&#x27;s Real, Worse Than Queer&quot; by Lucy Thane and &quot;Queercore: A Punk-u-mentary&quot; by Scott Treleaven. &quot;Gay Shame &#x27;98&quot; by Scott Berry documents the first Gay shame event. Tracy Flannigan&#x27;s &quot;Rise Above: A Tribe 8 Documentary&quot; was released in 2003, and &quot;Pansy Division: Life In A Gay Rock Band&quot; by Michael Carmona debuted in 2008, both films playing regularly at film festivals around the world.

2003 saw the premiere of the no budget comedy &quot;Malaqueerche: Queer Punk Rock Show&quot; by Sarah Adorable (of Scream Club) and Devon Devine, which brought the third wave of queercore to the screen. In 2008, G.B. Jones released the feature film &quot;The Lollipop Generation&quot;, featuring many of the participants in the queercore scene, including Jena von Brücker, Mark Ewert, Vaginal Davis, Jane Danger of Three Dollar Bill, Jen Smith, Joel Gibb, Anonymous Boy, Scott Treleaven and Gary Fembot of Sta-Prest, with music by The Hidden Cameras, Anonymous Boy and the Abominations, Bunny and the Lakers, Jane Danger, Swishin&#x27; Duds and Mariae Nascenti. All these films impacted the scene and broadened the scope of queercore to include film as another of its mediums of expression.

Lynn Breedlove (Tribe 8, writer), Matt Wobensmith (Outpunk Zine and Label, Queercorps Label), Jody Bleyle (Candy-Ass Records, Team Dresch, Hazel), The Psychic Sluts (Queer Performance Group), Wendy-O Matic (spoken word artist, writer), Laura Litter (Fabulous Disaster), Mia d´Bruzzi (Mudwimin, Fabulous Disaster) and Anna Joy (Blatz, Cyper in the Snow, The Gru´ps, writer) were interviewed in the documentary &quot;Step Up and Be Vocal - Interviews zu Queer Punk und Feminismus in San Francisco&quot;, a DIY-documentary made by German filmmakers Uta Busch and Sandra Ortmann in 2001.

2016 saw the premiere of the queer punk rock musical &quot;Spidarlings&quot; directed by Selene Kapsaski. The film was released in 2017 by Troma Entertainment.

== Zines ==
As with punk and hardcore, queercore culture existed outside of the mainstream, so amateur-produced and inexpensively photocopied zines were crucial to its development and to communication between members of the subculture. Hundreds of zines formed an intercontinental network that enabled queercore to spread and allow those in smaller, more repressive communities to participate and learn about bands, labels and scene activists. The DIY attitude of punk was integral to queercore as well.

In the 1990s, as the availability of the internet increased, many queercore zines could be found online as well as in print. Queercore forums and chatrooms, such as &quot;QueerPunks,&quot; started up. The Queer Zine Archive Project is an internet database of scanned queer zines that continues to grow. All these developments allowed queercore to become a self-sustaining and self-determined subculture, expressing itself through a variety of mediums independent of the straight and gay establishment.
