<text>Jerry Ray Lucas (born March 30, 1940) is an American former basketball player. He was a nationally awarded high school player, national college star at Ohio State University, and 1960 gold medal Olympian and international player before later starring as a professional player in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

As a collegian, Lucas led the Ohio State Buckeyes to three straight NCAA finals (1960–1962), winning the national championship in 1960, and finishing as runner-up in 1961 and 1962. He is the only three-time Big Ten Basketball Player of the Year and was named the NCAA Player of the Year in 1961 and 1962 by the United States Basketball Writers Association (now Oscar Robertson Award), the Associated Press, and the Sporting News.

As a professional, Lucas was named All-NBA First Team three times, All-NBA Second Team twice, an NBA All-Star seven times (including six years in a row), was the 1964 NBA Rookie of the Year, and was named Most Valuable Player of the 1965 NBA All-Star Game among other honors and awards. He is one of eight players to ever achieve the basketball Triple Crown, and was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1980.

==Early life==
Jerry Ray Lucas was born on March 30, 1940, in Middletown, Ohio, a community of 30,000+ halfway between Dayton and Cincinnati. Middletown then called itself &quot;The Basketball Capital of Ohio&quot;, based on the success of the basketball teams from the town&#x27;s one high school. The Middies had already won five Ohio state high school championships between 1945 and 1955 before Lucas ever played at Middletown High. Local support for the team was remarkably high in the early and mid-1950s. A tall youth, Lucas was encouraged to take up the game and soon dedicated himself to the town&#x27;s game.

In addition to strong local support for Middletown High basketball, the city was also home to a remarkable summer outdoor basketball scene that had developed at Sunset Park. Previous Middletown players who had gone on to play at the college level had successfully recruited other college players to play there in the summer. By the time Lucas was age 15 in 1955, Sunset Park was one of the best summer basketball scenes in the region. By then, Lucas had also grown to 6&#x27;7&quot; and had the opportunity to scrimmage against these college players, advancing his game greatly. Lucas was, in fact, outplaying college-level big men before he played his first game for Middletown High.

The budding basketball star had, by then, also started to display a remarkable, if unusual intelligence. A straight-A student with a penchant for memorizing his school work, Lucas had started to develop memory games for himself as early as age nine. One trick he would be known for was his ability to take words apart and reassemble them quickly in alphabetical order. &quot;Basketball&quot; became &quot;aabbekllst&quot;. He also applied his intelligence successfully to his coaching in the game.

==High school==
Lucas started play at Middletown as a sophomore in the 1955–56 season. Even at 15, Lucas was a remarkable athlete who could play above the rim. His coach, Paul Walker, had already won three Ohio state champions at Middletown, and Lucas consistently found himself surrounded by strong teammates. As a sophomore, Lucas focused his game primarily on rebounding and passing, but still became a scoring star. Middletown&#x27;s schedule often featured strong teams from Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus, but remained undefeated. A February game held at Cincinnati Gardens against rival Hamilton, itself a nearby former state champion, drew over 13,000 at a time when crowd sizes of that kind were uncommon at any level of the game. The two state powers repeated that feat there in 1958.

In addition to being an excellent rebounder, Lucas also made 60% of his shots from the floor and 75% of his free throws. Wearing number #13, he was often compared to Wilt Chamberlain during his high school years. The 1955–56 Middletown team went undefeated, winning the state championship, and the 1956–57 team did too. He suffered just one loss as a senior, a 63–62 defeat in a state semi-final game against Columbus North. That loss ended a state-record 76 game win streak. Lucas carried a 34-point scoring average through his high school years, and received national press when he surpassed Chamberlain&#x27;s high school total in points.

Throughout Lucas&#x27; career Middletown continued playing top prep teams from around the state. At Cleveland Arena, 12,000 fans saw Lucas score 53 points as Middletown won 99–78 against the undefeated Cleveland East Tech team in the 1956 state playoffs. In 1957, over 15,000 watched Middletown top Toledo Macomber in another state playoff game at Saint John Arena, then the home floor of the Ohio State Buckeyes. With this high level of exposure, Lucas received college scholarship offers from more than 150 schools, and was one of the most publicized American high school players when he graduated from high school in 1958. Lucas also threw the discus in track and field, finishing third at state in 1957, and fifth at state in 1958. Lucas was also a member of the National Honor Society.

Lucas ended his high school career as Middletown&#x27;s number one scorer with 2,460 points. In three years on the varsity he led the Middies to a 76–1 record, three state final fours (1956–1958), winning two state championships (1956 &amp; 1957).

==College career==

Lucas was the subject of considerable recruiting interest while at Middletown, to such a degree that measures were taken to protect the privacy of Lucas and his family. When he announced for Ohio State, he became the center of a legendary recruiting class in 1958 that included two more future Hall of Famers in player John Havlicek and future coach Bob Knight. Mel Nowell joined the group as well, giving the group three future NBA players with Lucas and Havlicek. Buckeyes freshman coach Fred Taylor helped all four feel comfortable with coming to Ohio State and soon after he was promoted to head varsity coach. 
Lucas had insisted on an academic scholarship to Ohio State and would continue to be an A-student at the college level. In addition to publicized scrimmages against an 11–11 1958–59 Ohio State varsity, the freshman Lucas was also asked by Woody Hayes to tutor Ohio State football players in their studies. Such was his reputation as a student. Lucas was also a member of the fraternity Beta Theta Pi at Ohio State.

Lucas played at a time when freshmen athletes were ineligible for varsity college sports, so he and his new teammates had to wait until 1959–60 to lead Ohio State. The four new recruits joined future NBA players Larry Siegfried and Joe Roberts on a loaded Buckeyes team for second-year varsity coach Taylor. The high offense Buckeyes scored 90 points per game and were soon known for their shooting accuracy and rebounding. After two early losses to Utah and Kentucky, the team lost only one more the rest of the way en route to the 1960 NCAA national championship. The Buckeyes overwhelmed defending champion California, 75–55, at the Cow Palace in San Francisco to win the 1960 title. Lucas, passing often, still averaged 26 points per game on a then-record 63% shooting. He also averaged 16 rebounds per game and was named Most Outstanding Player of the 1960 NCAA Final Four. Lucas was on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; for the first time in January 1960.

In 1960–61, #1-ranked Ohio State ran a winning streak of 32 games all the way to the NCAA Final. Lucas and the team received considerable national publicity that year, especially after winning the 1960 Holiday Tournament at Madison Square Garden. In March 1961 against Kentucky, Lucas became the only college player to date to ever record a &quot;30–30&quot; in an NCAA tournament game (33 points, 30 rebounds). But in the finals, they were upset by the University of Cincinnati Bearcats, in overtime, 70–65.

By the time the 1961–62 season had started, the 6&#x27; 8&quot; 230-pound Lucas had played basketball nearly non-stop for two years—he played the 1959–60 season, 1960 Olympics, 1960–61 season, and then the 1961 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) tour of the Soviet Union. Therefore, health was an issue when he returned from Russia weighing just 200 pounds in the fall of 1961. His sore knees were also an issue throughout his basketball career. But Lucas and the Buckeyes again posted another strong season and made it to the NCAA final, their third straight. Lucas was badly injured against Wake Forest in the semifinal preceding his rematch against the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. But he opted to play in the 1962 final anyway, believing it was his last game ever. During his college career, he had stated repeatedly that he would never turn pro. In his final college game, he moved poorly and Cincinnati again topped Ohio State. 
Lucas was All-American First Team all three years at Ohio State. His #11 was later the second number ever retired by the college in any sport. He is still widely considered the greatest player to ever play in the Big Ten today. The team went 78–6 during his years.
Gaining strong national exposure during these years, Lucas was named 1961 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, the first-ever basketball player to win the award. In 1963, he was awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor, which recognizes one student from the graduating class of each Big Ten member school, for demonstrating joint athletic and academic excellence throughout their college career. Lucas is still widely regarded as one of the greatest college players of all time.
==1960 Olympics and international play==
In the wake of leading the 1960 NCAA champions, Lucas was also named to the 1960 U.S.A. Olympic team for the Rome Games that year. He had a sub-par Olympic Trials, due to fatigue from the NCAA final and the high altitude of the Trials in Denver, but still easily led all Trials players in rebounding. Initially named to the U.S. team as a reserve forward, Lucas begged Olympic head coach Pete Newell to try him at his natural center spot. Despite the fact that two 6&#x27;11&quot; centers, Walt Bellamy and Darrall Imhoff, were present, Lucas got time at center and emerged as the regular starter for the U.S. team. The biggest game was played against the Soviet Union in September at the Palazzetto dello Sport in Rome, which the Americans won, 81–65. Lucas then scored 21 points in the gold medal final against Brazil to finish second to teammate Oscar Robertson for the team lead in scoring, with 134 points scored in the Olympics over eight games. Despite the physical play near the basket during those Games, Lucas received just six free throws total, but shot 80% from the floor to be a top scorer.

Afterward, Coach Newell, whose California team had just lost to Ohio State and Lucas in the 1960 NCAA final, called Lucas &quot;the greatest player I ever coached, and the most unselfish&quot;. The U.S. team also included future pro stars Jerry West, Terry Dischinger, Adrian Smith, and Bob Boozer. Lucas&#x27;s international play also includes being named to a team of AAU stars that toured the Soviet Union in mid-1961. That team played games in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv with Lucas starring at center, and won all eight games played. The coach of the team was future Basketball Hall of Famer John McLendon. The team had gotten the Soviet invitation when the AAU Cleveland Pipers, owned by a young George Steinbrenner, had won the AAU national championship. At the time, Steinbrenner was considering Lucas as a future pro player, and maneuvered to invite him onto the tour team. In 1964, Lucas was also part of a team of NBA players that played behind the Iron Curtain in Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia. Having toured the Soviet Union in 1961 as that team&#x27;s big star, Lucas was reportedly requested by these countries for the 1964 NBA tour. That team was coached by basketball Hall of Famer Red Auerbach and included several Boston Celtics, in addition to his Cincinnati pro teammate, Oscar Robertson.

==Professional career==
===Cleveland Pipers===
&quot;I never had any special desire to be a professional basketball player,&quot; Lucas later said about his pro career. In 1962, pro basketball had two cash-strapped leagues—the NBA and the startup ABL—and both coveted Lucas because of the crowds he drew.
In the NBA, the Cincinnati Royals had long held that league&#x27;s rights to Lucas, having drafted him as a high schooler with a territorial selection, which was allowed in the league then. However, Lucas declined their contract offer in May 1962.

This created an opportunity for the other league. The now-ABL Cleveland Pipers drafted Lucas, too. They interested the young star with a rare combination business-player contract offer. As part of the deal, Lucas received ownership stock in the team. The ABL agreed to shorten their season for him as well.

The NBA then made overtures to have the Pipers, with Lucas, jump leagues that summer. When that deal was approved by Steinbrenner, the NBA Royals protested and admission fees were added to the Cleveland deal. Unable to make all of the considerable payments, Steinbrenner&#x27;s team later collapsed and folded. With the ABL losing their league champion in Cleveland and dropping to just six teams afterward, their league folded as well at the end of 1962.

By then, Lucas had signed a business deal with Cleveland advertisers Howard Marks and Carl Glickman, and spoke often of having an NBA franchise in Cleveland. Because of this contract, he missed the 1962–63 NBA season. When the Marks expansion deal was denied by the NBA, Lucas was released from that contract. He decided he wanted to play pro basketball after all, and the Royals retained his rights.

===Cincinnati Royals (1963–1969)===

The Cincinnati Royals had reportedly been considering Lucas since before their arrival to the city of Cincinnati in 1957. They had secured rights to him in 1958 and drafted him in 1962. In August 1963, Lucas finally signed with Warren Hensel, who was then in process of briefly becoming the team&#x27;s owner. Signing the locally well-known Middletown and Ohio State star surged ticket sales for the team which had steadily declined in the two seasons before his signing. Attendance at Royals games doubled during Lucas&#x27;s first season of 1963–64.

In addition to Lucas, the 1963–64 Royals squad included three NBA All-Stars: Oscar Robertson, Wayne Embry and Jack Twyman. Lucas was moved to the big forward position his first season, and the Royals soon had the second-best record in the NBA that year. His role on the team would again be chiefly rebounding and other support play, but he scored 20 or more points several times, and led the league in field goal percentage as a rookie. Lucas also had four 30-rebound games, and one 40-rebound game on February 29, 1964, and remains the only NBA forward with a 40-rebound game. In the 1964 NBA playoffs, Lucas was injured when a Philadelphia player collided with him from behind. He played through the injury, but never quite recovered his form during the playoffs. In Cincinnati&#x27;s one playoff game win over Boston, Lucas posted a triple-double game with 16 points, 10 assists, and 25 rebounds, but the Royals lost in the Eastern Conference Finals.

In his second season, 1964–65, Lucas was asked to shoot and score more. In 1964–65 and 1965–66, he enjoyed his best seasons in Cincinnati, with the Royals posting a top 3 finish in the league each season. As one of the NBA&#x27;s most accurate shooters, Lucas posted two seasons of over 21 points per game as the team&#x27;s #2 scorer. He also averaged over 20 rebounds per game both seasons. In 1965–66, Lucas averaged 21.1 rebounds over 79 games, with 1668 rebounds total on the season. Those are both still all-time rebounding marks for NBA forwards. In addition to his scoring, rebounding, and shooting, Lucas made a name for himself as a big minutes man. In a sport where a regulation NBA game is 48 minutes, Lucas routinely played 43–44 minutes per game at two positions, starting forward, then backup center. Knee pain was still a big concern, and after the 1965–66 season, he nearly retired, but he found a prescription anti-inflammatory drug that allowed him to continue as a player. In the 1964–65 playoffs, Lucas averaged 23.3 points, 21 rebounds and 48.8 minutes over four games against Philadelphia. In the 1965–66 playoffs, he averaged 21.4 points, 20.2 rebounds and 46.2 minutes over the best-of-five series. He had again been injured in the 1966 playoffs, accidentally undercut from behind by a teammate, but still toughed through big minutes of play. He was named Most Valuable Player of the 1965 NBA All-Star Game in St. Louis, having scored 26 points. In the 1966 All-Star Game held in Cincinnati, he collected a team-high 19 rebounds for the East. 
In the fall of 1966, the Royals announced the move of nine or more home games to Cleveland, where the team hoped to use Lucas, the former would-be ABL Piper, as a popular crowd draw. He was becoming a heavier player who weighed 240–250 pounds, but he still was a starting East All-Star.

With the team declining at this point, and with his own health concerns, Lucas focused more on off-court business. As a cutting-edge corporate athlete, he sought endorsements. He also studied investment opportunities and tax shelters. By 1968, Lucas was reportedly worth over a million dollars, most of it built on off-court investments. There were only two or three other millionaire players in the NBA at that time. His most famous investment was his growing fast-food chain, Jerry Lucas Beef N Shakes. Lucas also created a number of children&#x27;s games during this period, starting his own toys and games company. He published a book on the many magic card tricks he often performed himself.

Healthier in 1967–68, he bounced back to postseason averages of 21.5 points per game, 52% shooting, 19 rebounds, and 44.1 minutes over all 82 games. He was second in the league to Chamberlain in rebounds and minutes played. He had also topped Bill Russell of Boston by more than 100 rebounds on the season as just the second player ever to out-rebound Russell over a full season. He was First Team All-NBA again, but the Royals missed the playoffs on the last day of the season.

Over 308 games from 1964 to 1968, Lucas averaged 20.5 points and 19.8 rebounds per game. The only other NBA player to be &#x27;20–20&#x27; as often was Chamberlain. The 1968–69 season saw the Royals briefly in first place early in the season. Tom Van Arsdale had been added to a team that included Robertson, Lucas and Connie Dierking, but the team played 15 regular season home games outside Cincinnati, which increased their traveling. The extra travel caused the team to wear down after their hot start. Lucas played in his sixth straight All-Star Game in 1969.

In 1969, the American economy tightened, and Lucas saw his lines of credit for his many investments close. Overextended on several fronts, his portfolio of investments collapsed. Lucas was soon forced to declare bankruptcy. His popularity among players, some of whom had lost their investments with him, declined markedly for a time.

===San Francisco Warriors (1969–1971)===
In 1969, Bob Cousy took over as coach of the Royals, who had again missed the playoffs in the tough NBA East Division of the day. Wanting more of a running team, Cousy did not favor Lucas, now a heavier, slower player. But Lucas had a no-trade clause in his contract, and could steer his transfer to a chosen team. He chose San Francisco.
In 1969–70, he suffered a broken hand, and went through a tough season. He bounced back to form in 1970–71, though, bringing himself back into playing shape at 230 pounds. Lucas averaged 19.2 points per game on 50% shooting, 15.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists. He returned to the NBA All-Star Game in 1971 for the seventh and final time. He was fifth in the league in rebounding in an NBA that now had 17 teams. Playing with Nate Thurmond, Clyde Lee, Jeff Mullins and Ron Williams, the .500 Warriors made the 1971 playoffs before losing to a powerful Milwaukee team that later won the 1971 NBA title.

===New York Knicks (1971–1974)===
By 1971, Lucas had established himself as one of the most accurate shooters and top rebounders in the league. With the Warriors needing a small scoring forward, Lucas was acquired by the New York Knicks for Cazzie Russell on May 7, 1971. The Knicks needed a big man to back up their starting center Willis Reed and power forward Dave DeBusschere. However, early in the 1971–72 season, Reed went down with a season-ending injury and Lucas was pressed into service at center. He was the smallest center in the league, and many were skeptical about how Lucas and the Knicks would do with this lineup. But at 31, Lucas had what may have been his best pro season, leading the Knicks in rebounds and shooting accuracy, and second on the team in both scoring and assists to Walt Frazier. His outside shooting, often well past today&#x27;s three-point line, changed defensive strategies, as opponents were forced to send their big man 20 feet from the basket to guard Lucas.

Lucas shot 51.2% from the floor that season. He was also an outstanding passing center, just as he had been in college. The team was fourth in the NBA in defense with Lucas at center. The Knicks then upset both Baltimore and Boston to make the 1972 NBA finals against Los Angeles. Lucas figured strongly in both series wins. Lucas also played very well, averaging 20.8 points on 50% shooting, 9.8 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 46.6 minutes in the series against the Lakers and Wilt Chamberlain. When Game Four went to overtime, he played all 53 minutes. But New York lost the series.

During this time, Lucas gained some press for a magic trick, &quot;The Phone Book&quot;. In it, he memorized about 50 pages of the Manhattan White Pages phone book. After other demonstrations, a party held by writer Dick Schaap and teammate Bill Bradley saw the trick tested by world chess champion Bobby Fischer, who was reportedly astounded.

In 1972–73, Reed, the New York team captain and star, returned. Lucas was sent to the bench for the first time in his career. But, to keep Reed healthy for the playoffs, he still played often. In averaging ten points and seven rebounds, he also averaged 4.5 assists. The team made the NBA finals again, and this time New York won.
This made Lucas one of the first to become a champion at every level of the game – high school, college, Olympics, and NBA (a feat matched by Quinn Buckner, and Magic Johnson). He is one of eight players who has ever achieved the basketball Triple Crown.

In the 1973–74 season, the Knicks made a run to repeat as champions, but lost to perennial rival Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals. Lucas played far less and was physically declining in his 11th professional season. The 34-year-old Lucas retired from the NBA following the season. His 15.6 per game career rebounding average is fourth-highest in league history as of 2020, and his 12,942 total is 17th all-time. He is also seventh all-time in minutes played per game, despite being a reserve the last two years of his career.

==Legacy==
In 1980, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame with Oscar Robertson and Jerry West, all in their first year of eligibility. He was selected by the NBA in 1996 as one of its 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, and again in 2021 as part of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In 1999 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Lucas to their &quot;Five Man College Team of the Century&quot;. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked the top 75 players of all time, and named Lucas as the 72nd greatest player in NBA history.

As an all-time player, Lucas is remembered for his remarkable fame as an amateur player, his dominance as a rebounder, especially for his height, and as a big man with a dangerous long-range shot, a combination unmatched before and only becoming approached since.

==Post-playing career==
After his NBA career ended, Lucas pursued publishing and educational endeavors. In 1974 he co-authored a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller, &quot;The Memory Book&quot;, and he developed an educational product he named the &quot;Lucas Learning System&quot;.

<doc id="313027" wikidata="Q278929" url="?curid=313027" title="White nationalism">
<text>White nationalism is a type of racial nationalism or pan-nationalism which espouses the belief that white people are a race and seeks to develop and maintain a white racial and national identity. Many of its proponents identify with the concept of a white ethnostate.

White nationalists say they seek to ensure the survival of the white race and the cultures of historically white states. They hold that white people should maintain their majority in majority-white countries, maintain their political and economic dominance, and that their cultures should be foremost in these countries. Many white nationalists believe that miscegenation, multiculturalism, immigration of nonwhites and low birth rates among whites are threatening the white race.

Analysts describe white nationalism as overlapping with white supremacism and white separatism. White nationalism is sometimes described as a euphemism for, or subset of, white supremacism, and the two have been used interchangeably by journalists and analysts. White separatism is the pursuit of a &quot;white-only state&quot;, while supremacism is the belief that white people are superior to nonwhites and should dominate them, taking ideas from social Darwinism and Nazism. Critics argue that the term &quot;white nationalism&quot; is simply a &quot;rebranding&quot;, and ideas such as white pride exist solely to provide a sanitized public face for &quot;white supremacy&quot;, which white nationalists allegedly avoid using because of its negative connotations, and that most white nationalist groups promote racial violence.

==History and usage==
According to Merriam-Webster, the first documented use of the term &quot;white nationalist&quot; was 1951, to refer to a member of a militant group which espouses white supremacy and racial segregation. Merriam-Webster also notes usage of the two-word phrase as early as 1925. According to Dictionary.com, the term was first used in the title of a 1948 essay by South African writer and ecologist Thomas Chalmers Robertson titled &quot;Racism Comes to Power in South Africa: The Threat of White Nationalism&quot;.

According to Daryl Johnson, a former counterterrorism expert at the Department of Homeland Security, the term was used to appear more credible while also avoiding negative stereotypes about white supremacists. Modern members of racist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan generally favor the term and avoid self-describing as white supremacist.

Some sociologists have used white nationalism as an umbrella term for a range of white supremacist groups and ideologies, while others regard these movements as distinct. Analysis suggests that two groups largely overlap in terms of membership, ideology, and goals. Civil rights groups have described the two terms as functionally interchangeable. Ryan Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Center has said &quot;there is really no difference&quot;, and Kristen Clarke of the Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law has said &quot;There is no defensible distinction that can be drawn between white supremacy, white nationalism or white separatism in society today.&quot; News reports will sometimes refer to a group or movement by one term or the other, or both interchangeably.

==Views==
White nationalists claim that culture is a product of race, and advocate for the self-preservation of white people. White nationalists seek to ensure the survival of the white race, and the cultures of historically white nations. They hold that white people should maintain their majority in mainly-white countries, maintain their dominance of its political and economic life, and that their culture should be foremost. Many white nationalists believe that miscegenation, multiculturalism, mass immigration of non-whites and low birth rates among whites are threatening the white race, and some argue that it amounts to white genocide.

Political scientist Samuel P. Huntington described white nationalists as arguing that the demographic shift in the United States towards non-whites would bring a new culture that is intellectually and morally inferior. White nationalists claim that this demographic shift brings affirmative action, immigrant ghettos and declining educational standards. Most American white nationalists say immigration should be restricted to people of European ancestry.

White nationalists embrace a variety of religious and non-religious beliefs, including various denominations of Christianity, generally Protestant, although some specifically overlap with white nationalist ideology (Christian Identity, for example, is a family of white supremacist denominations), Germanic neopaganism (e.g. Wotanism) and atheism.

===Definitions of whiteness===
Most white nationalists define white people in a restricted way. In the United States, it often—though not exclusively—implies European ancestry of non-Jewish descent. Some white nationalists draw on 19th-century racial taxonomy. White nationalist Jared Taylor has argued that Jews can be considered &quot;white&quot;, although this is controversial within white nationalist circles. Many white nationalists oppose Israel and Zionism, while some, such as William Daniel Johnson and Taylor, have expressed support for Israel and have drawn parallels between their ideology and Zionism. Other white nationalists such as George Lincoln Rockwell exclude Jews from the definition but include Turks, who are a transcontinental ethnicity.

White nationalist definitions of race are derived from the fallacy of racial essentialism, which presumes that people can be meaningfully categorized into different races by biology or appearance. White nationalism and white supremacy view race as a hierarchy of biologically discrete groups. This has led to the use of often contradictory obsolete racial categories such as Aryanism, Nordicism, or the one-drop rule. Since the second half of the 20th century, attempts to categorize humans by race have become increasingly seen as largely pseudoscientific.

==Regional movements==

===Australia===
The White Australia policy was semi-official government policy in Australia until the mid twentieth century. It restricted non-white immigration to Australia and gave preference to British migrants over all others.

The Barton government, which won the first elections following the Federation of Australia in 1901, was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union and other labor organizations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded. The first Parliament of Australia quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia&#x27;s &quot;British character&quot;, passing the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 and the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 before parliament rose for its first Christmas recess. The Immigration Restriction Act limited immigration to Australia and required a person seeking entry to Australia to write out a passage of 50 words dictated to them in any European language, not necessarily English, at the discretion of an immigration officer. Barton argued in favour of the bill: &quot;The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman.&quot; The passage chosen for the test could often be very difficult, so that even if the test was given in English, a person was likely to fail. The test enabled immigration officials to exclude individuals on the basis of race without explicitly saying so. Although the test could theoretically be given to any person arriving in Australia, in practice it was given selectively on the basis of race. This test was later abolished in 1958.

Australian Prime Minister Stanley Bruce supported the White Australia policy, and made it an issue in his campaign for the 1925 Australian federal election.

It is necessary that we should determine what are the ideals towards which every Australian would desire to strive. I think those ideals might well be stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance of our White Australia Policy to continue as an integral portion of the British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its peoples to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble in many parts of the world.

At the beginning of World War II, Prime Minister John Curtin (ALP) expressed support for White Australia policy: &quot;This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.&quot;

Another (ALP) Leader of the Labor Party from 1960 to 1967 Arthur Calwell supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell&#x27;s comments in his 1972 memoirs, &quot;Be Just and Fear Not&quot;, in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:

I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.

He was the last leader of either the Labour or Liberal party to support it.

===Canada===
The Parliament of Canada passed the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 to bar all Chinese from coming to Canada with the exception of diplomats, students, and those granted special permission by the Minister of Immigration. Chinese immigration to Canada had already been heavily regulated by the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 which required Chinese immigrants to pay a $50 fee to enter the country (the fee was increased to one hundred dollars in 1900 and to five hundred dollars in 1903). Groups such as the Asiatic Exclusion League, which had formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, on 12 August 1907 under the auspices of the Trades and Labour Council, pressured Parliament to halt Asian immigration. The Exclusion League&#x27;s stated aim was &quot;to keep Oriental immigrants out of British Columbia.&quot;

The Canadian government also attempted to restrict immigration from British India by passing an order-in-council on 8 January 1908. It prohibited immigration of persons who &quot;in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior&quot; did not &quot;come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a continuous journey and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality.&quot; In practice, this applied only to ships that began their voyages in India, because the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in either Japan or Hawaii. These regulations came at a time when Canada was accepting massive numbers of immigrants (over 400,000 in 1913 alone), almost all of whom came from Europe. This piece of legislation has been called the &quot;continuous journey regulation&quot;.

===Germany===
The Thule Society developed out of the &quot;Germanic Order&quot; in 1918, and those who wanted to join the &quot;Order&quot; in 1917 had to sign a special &quot;blood declaration of faith&quot; concerning their lineage: &quot;The signer hereby swears to the best of his knowledge and belief that no Jewish or coloured blood flows in either his or in his wife&#x27;s veins, and that among their ancestors are no members of the coloured races.&quot; Heinrich Himmler, one of the main perpetrators of the Holocaust, said in a speech in 1937: &quot;The next decades do in fact not mean some struggle of foreign politics which Germany can overcome or not... but a question of to be or not to be for the white race...&quot; As the Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg said on 29 May 1938 on the Steckelburg in Schlüchtern: &quot;It is however certain that all of us share the fate of Europe, and that we shall regard this common fate as an obligation, because in the end the very existence of White people depends on the unity of the European continent.&quot;

At the same time, the Nazi Party subdivided white people into groups, viewing the Nordics as the &quot;master race&quot; (&quot;Herrenvolk&quot;) above groups like Alpine and Mediterranean peoples. Slavic peoples, such as Russians and Poles, were considered &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (subhumans) instead of Aryan. Adolf Hitler&#x27;s conception of the Aryan &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; (&quot;Aryan master race&quot;) explicitly excluded the vast majority of Slavs, regarding the Slavs as having dangerous Jewish and Asiatic influences. The Nazis, because of this, declared Slavs to be &quot;Untermenschen&quot;. Hitler described Slavs as &quot;a mass of born slaves who feel the need of a master&quot;. Hitler declared that because Slavs were subhumans that the Geneva Conventions were not applicable to them, and German soldiers in World War II were thus permitted to ignore the Geneva Conventions in regard to Slavs. Hitler called Slavs &quot;a rabbit family&quot; meaning they were intrinsically idle and disorganized. Nazi Germany&#x27;s propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels had media speak of Slavs as primitive animals who were from the Siberian tundra who were like a &quot;dark wave of filth&quot;. The Nazi notion of Slavs being inferior was part of the agenda for creating &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&quot;living space&quot;) for Germans and other Germanic people in Central and Eastern Europe that was initiated during World War II under , millions of Germans and other Germanic settlers would be moved into conquered territories of Eastern Europe, while the original Slavic inhabitants were to be exterminated and enslaved. Nazi Germany&#x27;s ally the Independent State of Croatia rejected the common conception that Croats were primarily a Slavic people and claimed that Croats were primarily the descendants of the Germanic Goths. However the Nazi regime continued to classify Croats as &quot;subhuman&quot; in spite of the alliance.

===Hungary===

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán stated in 2018 that &quot;we do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed: we do not want our own colour, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others.&quot; In 2022, he stated that &quot;we do not want to become peoples of mixed-race,&quot; praising &quot;The Camp of the Saints&quot; and referring specifically to the admixture of Europeans and non-European migrants, commenting that racially mixed countries &quot;are no longer nations.&quot; Two days later in Vienna, he clarified that he was talking about cultures and not about race. Laura Barrón-López of PBS described his ideology as white nationalist. White nationalists of the American alt-right and the European identitarian movements enthusiastically support Orbán&#x27;s policies. Some have personally migrated there and collaborated with the political party Jobbik.

===New Zealand===
Following the example of anti-Chinese poll taxes enacted by California in 1852 and by Australian states in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, John Hall&#x27;s government passed the Chinese Immigration Act 1881. This imposed a £10 tax per Chinese person entering the Colony of New Zealand, and permitted only one Chinese immigrant for every 10 tons of cargo. Richard Seddon&#x27;s government increased the tax to £100 per head in 1896, and tightened the other restriction to only one Chinese immigrant for every 200 tons of cargo.

The Immigration Restriction Act of 1899 prohibited the entry of immigrants who were not of British or Irish parentage and who were unable to fill out an application form in &quot;any European language&quot;. The Immigration Restriction Amendment Act 1920 aimed to further limit Asian immigration into the Dominion of New Zealand by requiring all potential immigrants not of British or Irish parentage to apply in writing for a permit to enter the country. The Minister of Customs had the discretion to determine whether any applicant was &quot;suitable&quot;. Prime Minister William Massey asserted that the act was &quot;the result of a deep seated sentiment on the part of a huge majority of the people of this country that this Dominion shall be what is often called a &#x27;white&#x27; New Zealand.&quot;

One case of a well known opponent of non-European immigration to New Zealand is that of white supremacist Lionel Terry who, after traveling widely to South Africa, British Columbia and finally New Zealand and publishing a book highly critical of capitalism and Asian immigration, shot and killed an elderly Chinese immigrant in Wellington. Terry was convicted of murder in 1905 and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life incarceration in New Zealand psychiatric institutions.

A Department of External Affairs memorandum in 1953 stated: &quot;Our immigration is based firmly on the principle that we are and intend to remain a country of European development. It is inevitably discriminatory against Asians—indeed against all persons who are not wholly of European race and colour. Whereas we have done much to encourage immigration from Europe, we do everything to discourage it from Asia.&quot;

===Paraguay===
In Paraguay, the New Australian Movement founded New Australia, a white supremacist utopian socialist settlement in 1893. Its founder, William Lane, intended the settlement to be based on a &quot;common-hold&quot; instead of a commonwealth, life marriage, teetotalism, communism and a brotherhood of Anglophone white people and the preservation of the &quot;colour-line&quot;. The colony was officially founded as &quot;Colonia Nueva Australia&quot; and comprised 238 adults and children.

In July 1893, the first ship left Sydney, Australia for Paraguay, where the government was keen to get white settlers, and had offered the group a large area of good land. The settlement had been described as a refuge for misfits, failures and malcontents of the left wing of Australian democracy. Notable Australian individuals who joined the colony included Mary Gilmore, Rose Summerfield and Gilbert Stephen Casey. Summerfield was the mother of León Cadogan, a noted Paraguayan ethnologist.

Due to poor management and a conflict over the prohibition of alcohol, the government of Paraguay eventually dissolved New Australia as a cooperative. Some colonists founded communes elsewhere in Paraguay but others returned to Australia or moved to England. , around 2,000 descendants of the New Australia colonists still lived in Paraguay.

===South Africa===

In South Africa, white nationalism was championed by the National Party starting in 1914, when it was established as a political party to represent Afrikaners after the Second Boer War by J. B. M. Hertzog in 1914. It articulated a policy promoting white &quot;civilised labour&quot; above African &quot;&quot;swart gevaar&quot;,&quot; and some radical nationalist movements such as the Afrikaner Broederbond, D. F. Malan&#x27;s Purified National Party, and Oswald Pirow&#x27;s New Order openly sympathized with Nazi Germany. In 1948, the Reunited National Party under Malan won the South African general election against the more moderate United Party and implemented the segregationist social system known as apartheid. 

The Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act, 1959 established homelands (sometimes pejoratively referred to as Bantustans) for ten different black African tribes. The ultimate goal of the National Party was to move all Black South Africans into one of these homelands (although they might continue to work in South Africa as &quot;guest workers&quot;), leaving what was left of South Africa (about 87 percent of the land area) with what would then be a White South African majority, at least on paper. As the homelands were seen by the apartheid government as embryonic independent nations, all Black South Africans were registered as citizens of the homelands, not of the nation as a whole, and were expected to exercise their political rights only in the homelands. Accordingly, the three token parliamentary seats that had been reserved for White representatives of black South Africans in Cape Province were scrapped. The other three provinces—Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and Natal—had never allowed any Black representation.

Coloureds were removed from the Common Roll of Cape Province in 1953. Instead of voting for the same representatives as white South Africans, they could now only vote for four White representatives to speak for them. Later, in 1968, the Coloureds were disenfranchised altogether. In the place of the four parliamentary seats, a partially elected body was set up to advise the government in an amendment to the Separate Representation of Voters Act.

During the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, the government implemented a policy of &quot;resettlement&quot;, to force people to move to their designated &quot;group areas&quot;. Millions of people were forced to relocate during this period. These removals included people relocated due to slum clearance programs, labour tenants on White-owned farms, the inhabitants of the so-called &quot;black spots&quot;, areas of Black owned land surrounded by White farms, the families of workers living in townships close to the homelands, and &quot;surplus people&quot; from urban areas, including thousands of people from the Western Cape (which was declared a &quot;Coloured Labour Preference Area&quot;) who were moved to the Transkei and Ciskei homelands. The best-publicised forced removals of the 1950s occurred in Johannesburg, when 60,000 people were moved to the new township of Soweto, an abbreviation for South Western Townships.

Until 1955, Sophiatown had been one of the few urban areas where Blacks were allowed to own land, and was slowly developing into a multiracial slum. As industry in Johannesburg grew, Sophiatown became the home of a rapidly expanding black workforce, as it was convenient and close to town. It could also boast the only swimming pool for Black children in Johannesburg. As one of the oldest black settlements in Johannesburg, Sophiatown held an almost symbolic importance for the 50,000 Blacks it contained, both in terms of its sheer vibrancy and its unique culture. Despite a vigorous African National Congress protest campaign and worldwide publicity, the removal of Sophiatown began on 9 February 1955 under the Western Areas Removal Scheme. In the early hours, heavily armed police entered Sophiatown to force residents out of their homes and load their belongings onto government trucks. The residents were taken to a large tract of land, thirteen miles (19 km) from the city center, known as Meadowlands (that the government had purchased in 1953). Meadowlands became part of a new planned Black city called Soweto. The Sophiatown slum was destroyed by bulldozers, and a new White suburb named Triomf (Triumph) was built in its place. This pattern of forced removal and destruction was to repeat itself over the next few years, and was not limited to people of African descent. Forced removals from areas like Cato Manor (Mkhumbane) in Durban, and District Six in Cape Town, where 55,000 coloured and Indian people were forced to move to new townships on the Cape Flats, were carried out under the Group Areas Act 1950. Ultimately, nearly 600,000 coloured, Indian and Chinese people were moved in terms of the Group Areas Act. Some 40,000 White people were also forced to move when land was transferred from &quot;White South Africa&quot; into the Black homelands.

Before South Africa became a republic, politics among white South Africans was typified by the division between the chiefly Afrikaans-speaking pro-republic conservative and the largely English-speaking anti-republican liberal sentiments, with the legacy of the Boer War still constituting a political factor for sections of the white populace. Once South Africa&#x27;s status as a republic was attained, Hendrik Verwoerd called for improved relations and greater accord between the two groups. He claimed that the only difference now was between those who supported apartheid and those who stood in opposition to it. The ethnic divide would no longer be between white Afrikaans-speakers and English-speakers, but rather White and Black South Africans. Most Afrikaners supported the notion of unanimity of White people to ensure their safety. Anglophone white South Africans voters were divided. Many had opposed a republic, leading to a majority &quot;no&quot; vote in Natal. Later, however, some of them recognized the perceived need for White unity, convinced by the growing trend of decolonization elsewhere in Africa, which left them apprehensive. Harold Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Wind of Change&quot; pronouncement lead the Anglophone white South African population to perceive that the British government had abandoned them. The more conservative Anglophones gave support to Verwoerd; others were troubled by the severing of ties with Britain and remained loyal to the Crown. They were acutely displeased at the choice between British and South African nationality. Although Verwoerd tried to bond these different blocs, the subsequent ballot illustrated only a minor swell of support, indicating that a great many Anglophones remained apathetic and that Verwoerd had not succeeded in uniting the White population in South Africa.

The Black Homeland Citizenship Act of 1970 was a denaturalization law passed during the apartheid era of South Africa that changed the status of the inhabitants of the Bantustans (Black homelands) so that they were no longer citizens of South Africa. The aim was to ensure that white South Africans came to make up the majority of the &quot;de jure&quot; population.

===United States===

====History====
The Naturalization Act of 1790 () provided the first rules to be followed by the United States government in granting national citizenship. This law limited naturalization to immigrants who were &quot;free white persons&quot; of &quot;good moral character.&quot; In 1856, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; decision that free blacks descended from slaves could not hold United States citizenship even if they had been born in the country. Major changes to this racial requirement for US citizenship did not occur until the years following the American Civil War. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed to grant birthright citizenship to black people born in the US, but it specifically excluded untaxed Indians, because they were separate nations. However, citizenship for other non-whites born in the US was not settled until 1898 with &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot;, 169 U.S. 649, which concluded with an important precedent in its interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This racial definition of American citizenship has had consequences for perceptions of American identity.

In a 4 January 1848 speech to the Senate regarding the issue of whether or not to annex the entirety of Mexico after the Mexican-American war, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina said, &quot;I know further, sir, that we have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race—the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind of incorporating an Indian race; for more than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes. I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.&quot;

Following the defeat of the Confederate States of America and the abolition of slavery in the United States at the end of the American Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was founded as an insurgent group with the goal of maintaining the Southern racial system throughout the Reconstruction Era. The creation of this group was able to instill fear in African Americans while, in some cases, filling white Americans with pride in their race and reassurance in the fact that they will stay &#x27;on top&#x27;. The message they gave to people around them was that, even though the Confederate States did not exist anymore, the same principle remained in their minds: whites were superior. Although the first incarnation of the KKK was focused on maintaining the Antebellum South, its second incarnation in the 1915-1940s period was much more oriented towards white nationalism and American nativism, with slogans such as &quot;One Hundred Percent Americanism&quot; and &quot;America for Americans&quot;, in which &quot;Americans&quot; were understood to be white and Protestant. The 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; is an example of an allegorical invocation of white nationalism during this time, and its positive portrayal of the first KKK is considered to be one of the factors which led to the emergence of the second KKK.

The second KKK was founded in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1915 and, starting in 1921, it adopted a modern business system of recruiting. The organization grew rapidly nationwide at a time of prosperity. Reflecting the social tensions of urban industrialization and vastly increased immigration, its membership grew most rapidly in cities and spread out of the South to the Midwest and West. The second KKK called for strict morality and better enforcement of prohibition. Its rhetoric promoted anti-Catholicism and nativism. Some local groups took part in attacks on private houses and carried out other violent activities. The violent episodes were generally in the South.

The second KKK was a formal fraternal organization, with a national and state structure. At its peak in the mid-1920s, the organization claimed to include about 15% of the nation&#x27;s eligible population, approximately 4 to 5 million men. Internal divisions, criminal behavior by leaders, and external opposition brought about a collapse in membership, which had dropped to about 30,000 by 1930. It faded away in the 1940s.

Starting in the 1960s, white nationalism grew in the US as the conservative movement developed in mainstream society. Samuel P. Huntington argues that it developed as a reaction to a perceived decline in the essence of American identity as European, Anglo-Protestant and English-speaking. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 had opened entry to the US to immigrants other than traditional Northern European and Germanic groups, and as a result it would significantly, and unintentionally, alter the demographic mix in the US.

The slogan &quot;white power&quot; was popularized by American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell, who used the term in a debate with Stokely Carmichael of the Black Panther Party after Carmichael issued a call for &quot;black power&quot;. Rockwell advocated a return to white control of all American institutions, and violently opposed any minority advancement. He rejected the Nazi idea of &quot;master race&quot;, however, and accepted all white European nationalities in his ideology, including Turks.

One influential white nationalist in the United States was William Luther Pierce, who founded the National Alliance in 1974.

In the United States a movement calling for white separatism emerged in the 1980s. Leonard Zeskind has chronicled the movement in his book &quot;Blood and Politics&quot;, in which he argues that it has moved from the &quot;margins to the mainstream&quot;.

During the 1980s the United States also saw an increase in the number of esoteric subcultures within white nationalism. According to Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, these movements cover a wide variety of mutually influencing groups of a radically ethnocentric character which have emerged, especially in the English-speaking world, since World War II. These loose networks use a variety of mystical, occult or religious approaches in a defensive affirmation of white identity against modernity, liberalism, immigration, multiracialism, and multiculturalism. Some are neo-fascist, neo-Nazi or Third Positionist; others are politicised around some form of white ethnic nationalism or identity politics, and a few have national anarchist tendencies. One example is the neo-tribalist paganism promoted by Else Christensen&#x27;s Odinist Fellowship. Especially notable is the prevalence of devotional forms and esoteric themes, so these subcultures often have the character of new religious movements.

Included under the same umbrella by Goodrick-Clarke are movements ranging from conservative revolutionary schools of thought (&quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot;, European New Right, Evolian Traditionalism) to white supremacist and white separatist interpretations of Christianity and paganism (Christian Identity, Creativity, Nordic racial paganism) to neo-Nazi subcultures (Esoteric Hitlerism, Nazi Satanism, National Socialist black metal).

In the 2010s, the alt-right, a broad term covering many different far-right ideologies and groups in the United States, some of which endorse white nationalism, gained traction as an alternative to mainstream conservatism in its national politics. The comic book super hero Captain America, in an ironic co-optation, has been used for dog whistle politics by the alt-right in college campus recruitment in 2017.

North Idaho state Rep. Heather Scott—who in 2015 had paraded with a Confederate battle flag—in 2017 attempted to distinguish &quot;white supremacy&quot; from &quot;white nationalism&quot;, claiming that the former was characterized by &quot;extreme racism&quot; and &quot;violent acts&quot; while the latter was merely nationalism by people who happen to be white, i.e. in her personal use of the term, a white nationalist is &quot;no more than a Caucasian who for the Constitution and making America great again.&quot; Scott&#x27;s interpretation of the term was rejected as &quot;incorrect&quot; by University of Idaho sociology professor Kristin Haltinner and as &quot;patently false&quot; by Vanderbilt University sociology professor Sophie Bjork-James.

In 2019, the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 to study whether it would be possible to screen military enlistees for &quot;white nationalist&quot; beliefs. However, the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate eliminated those words before passing the bill, expanding the wording to &quot;extremist and gang-related activity&quot;, rather than specifically referencing white nationalism.

==== Statistics ====
In 2016, the American National Election Studies survey conducted during Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign for the presidency found that 38% of Americans expressed &quot;strong feelings of white solidarity&quot;, 28% &quot;strong feelings of white identity&quot;, 27% that whites suffer from discrimination in American society, while 6% agree with all these propositions.

In 2020, it was reported that white nationalist groups leaving flyers, stickers, banners and posters in public places more than doubled from 1,214 in 2018 to 2,713 in 2019.

In a July 2021 Morning Consult Poll found that among Republican-leaning male voters, 23 percent responded that they have a favorable view of white nationalist groups. Eleven percent of Republican men surveyed said they have a &quot;very favorable&quot; view while 12 percent said they are only &quot;somewhat&quot;, With Democratic men it was 17 percent who said they have some form of &quot;favorable&quot; view of white nationalist groups.

Also in 2021, a poll found that in the state of Oregon, nearly four in 10 respondents strongly or somewhat agree with statements that reflect core arguments of white nationalism. In 2018, 31 percent believed that America had to protect or preserve its White European heritage, while in 2021 it went up to 40 percent.

According to journalist David D. Kirkpatrick, as of mid 2024, scholars of the far right estimate that 100,000 Americans &quot;actively participate in organized white nationalist groups&quot;.

==== Relationships with black separatist groups ====
In February 1962 George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi Party, spoke at a Nation of Islam (NOI) rally in Chicago, where he was applauded by Elijah Muhammad as he pronounced: &quot;I am proud to stand here before black men. I believe Elijah Muhammed is the Adolf Hitler of the black man!&quot; Rockwell had attended, but did not speak at, an earlier NOI rally in Washington, D.C., in June 1961, and once, he even donated $20 to the NOI. In 1965, after breaking with the Nation of Islam and denouncing its separatist doctrine, Malcolm X told his followers that the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad had made secret agreements with the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan.

Rockwell and other white supremacists (e.g. Willis Carto) also supported less well-known black separatist groups, such as Hassan Jeru-Ahmed&#x27;s Blackman&#x27;s Army of Liberation, in reference to which Rockwell told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter Michael Drosnin in 1967 that if &quot;Any Negro wants to go back to Africa, I&#x27;ll carry him piggy-back.&quot;

Tom Metzger, a former Ku Klux Klan leader from California, spoke at a NOI rally in Los Angeles in September 1985 and donated $100 to the group. In October of that same year, over 200 prominent white supremacists met at former Klan leader Robert E. Miles&#x27;s farm to discuss an alliance with Louis Farrakhan, head of the NOI. In attendance were Edward Reed Fields of the National States&#x27; Rights Party, Richard Girnt Butler of the Aryan Nations, Don Black, Roy Frankhouser, and Metzger, who said that &quot;America is like a rotting carcass. The Jews are living off the carcass like the parasites they are. Farrakhan understands this.&quot;

==== 2016 Trump presidential campaign ====
From the outset of his campaign, Donald Trump was endorsed by various white nationalist and white supremacist movements and leaders, (who were attracted to his accusation that Barack Obama was born in Africa, his denigration of immigrants as &quot;criminals and rapists&quot;, of &quot;shithole countries&quot; in Africa and the Caribbean, and more recently that there is &quot;a definite anti-white feeling&quot; in the United States that he would correct, according to journalist David D. Kirkpatrick). On 24 February 2016, David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, expressed vocal support for Trump&#x27;s campaign on his radio show. Shortly thereafter in an interview with Jake Tapper, Trump repeatedly claimed to be ignorant of Duke and his support. Republican presidential rivals were quick to respond on his wavering, and Senator Marco Rubio stated the Duke endorsement made Trump unelectable. Others questioned his professed ignorance of Duke by pointing out that in 2000, Trump called him a &quot;Klansman&quot;. Trump later blamed the incident on a poor earpiece he was given by CNN. Later the same day Trump stated that he had previously disavowed Duke in a tweet posted with a video on his Twitter account. On 3 March 2016, Trump stated: &quot;David Duke is a bad person, who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years. I disavowed him. I disavowed the KKK.&quot;

On 22 July 2016 (the day after Trump&#x27;s nomination), Duke announced that he will be a candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate election in Louisiana. He commented, &quot;I&#x27;m overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I&#x27;ve championed for years.&quot; A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said Trump &quot;has disavowed David Duke and will continue to do so.&quot;

On 25 August 2016, Hillary Clinton gave a speech saying that Trump is &quot;taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.&quot; She identified this radical fringe with the &quot;alt-right&quot;, a largely online variation of American far-right that embraces white nationalism and is anti-immigration. During the election season, the alt-right movement &quot;evangelized&quot; online in support of racist and anti-semitic ideologies. Clinton noted that Trump&#x27;s campaign chief executive Stephen Bannon described his Breitbart News Network as &quot;the platform for the alt-right&quot;. On 9 September 2016, several leaders of the alt-right community held a press conference, described by one reporter as the &quot;coming-out party&quot; of the little-known movement, to explain their goals. They affirmed their racialist beliefs, stating &quot;Race is real, race matters, and race is the foundation of identity.&quot; Speakers called for a &quot;White Homeland&quot; and expounded on racial differences in intelligence. They also confirmed their support of Trump, saying &quot;This is what a leader looks like.&quot;

Richard B. Spencer, who ran the white nationalist National Policy Institute, said, &quot;Before Trump, our identity ideas, national ideas, they had no place to go&quot;. The editor of the neo-Nazi website &quot;The Daily Stormer&quot; stated, &quot;Virtually every alt-right Nazi I know is volunteering for the Trump campaign.&quot; Rocky Suhayda, chairman of the American Nazi Party said that although Trump &quot;isn&#x27;t one of us&quot;, his election would be a &quot;real opportunity&quot; for the white nationalist movement.

The Southern Poverty Law Center monitored Trump&#x27;s campaign throughout the election and noted several instances where Trump and lower-level surrogates either used white nationalist rhetoric or engaged with figures in the white nationalist movement.

==Criticism==
Numerous individuals and organizations have argued that ideas such as white pride and white nationalism exist merely to provide a sanitized public face for white supremacy. Kofi Buenor Hadjor argues that black nationalism is a response to racial discrimination, while white nationalism is the expression of white supremacy. Other critics have described white nationalism as a &quot;...somewhat paranoid ideology&quot; based upon the publication of pseudo-academic studies.

Carol M. Swain argues that the unstated goal of white nationalism is to appeal to a larger audience, and that most white nationalist groups promote white separatism and racial violence. Opponents accuse white nationalists of hatred, racial bigotry, and destructive identity politics. White supremacist groups have a history of perpetrating hate crimes, particularly against people of Jewish and African descent. Examples include the lynching of black people by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).

Some critics argue that white nationalists—while posturing as civil rights groups advocating the interests of their racial group—frequently draw on the nativist traditions of the KKK and the National Front. Critics have noted the anti-semitic rhetoric used by some white nationalists, as highlighted by the promotion of conspiracy theories such as Zionist Occupation Government.

<text>In law, an en banc (; alternatively in banc, in banco or in bank; ) session is when all the judges of a court sit to hear a case, not just one judge or a smaller panel of judges.
For courts like the United States Courts of Appeals in which each case is heard by a three-judge panel instead of the entire court, &quot;en banc&quot; review is usually used for only unusually complex or important cases or when the court believes there is an especially significant issue at stake. &quot;En banc&quot; is a French phrase meaning &quot;in bench&quot;.

==United States==

Federal appeals courts in the United States sometimes grant rehearing to reconsider the decision of a panel of the court (consisting of only three judges) in which the case concerns a matter of exceptional public importance or the panel&#x27;s decision appears to conflict with a prior decision of the court. In rarer instances, an appellate court will order hearing &quot;en banc&quot; as an initial matter instead of the panel hearing it first.

Cases in United States courts of appeals are heard by three-judge panels, randomly chosen from the sitting appeals court judges of that circuit. If a party loses before a circuit panel, it may appeal for a rehearing &quot;en banc&quot;. A majority of the active circuit judges must agree to hear or rehear a case &quot;en banc&quot;. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure state that &quot;en banc&quot; proceedings are disfavored but may be ordered to maintain uniformity of decisions within the circuit or if the issue is exceptionally important (Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)). 

Each federal circuit has its own particular rules regarding &quot;en banc&quot; proceedings. The circuit rules for the Seventh Circuit provide a process where, under certain circumstances, a panel can solicit the consent of the other circuit judges to overrule a prior decision and thus avoid the need for an &quot;en banc&quot; proceeding. Federal law provides that for courts with more than 15 judges, an &quot;en banc&quot; hearing may consist of &quot;such number of members of its &quot;en banc&quot; courts as may be prescribed by rule of the court of appeals.&quot; The Ninth Circuit, with 29 judges, uses this procedure, and its &quot;en banc&quot; court consists of 11 judges. Theoretically, the Ninth Circuit can render &quot;en banc&quot; decisions with all 29 judges participating; such a hearing would overrule a prior 11-judge &quot;en banc&quot; hearing on the same case. Though no rule exists barring a party from requesting such a hearing, none has ever been granted. The Fifth Circuit, with 17 judges, adopted a similar procedure in 1986. &quot;State of La. ex rel. Guste v. M/V TESTBANK&quot;, 752 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir. 1985) (en banc). The Sixth Circuit has 16 judges, but , has not adopted such a policy yet. The FISA Court sat en banc for the first time in 2017 in a case concerning bulk data collection.

== United Kingdom ==
The UK Supreme Court has criteria in place to determine the size of the panel that sits on any one case, and particularly important cases can be heard by a panel comprising all but one of the justices. This has been described as sitting &quot;en banc&quot; by Lady Hale, then President of the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court has twelve justices, and cases are ordinarily decided by panels of five. The largest possible panel is 11 of the 12 justices, to prevent a deadlock. Eleven judges may sit on a panel:
* in cases where the court is being asked to depart, or may decide to depart from a previous decision;
* in cases of high constitutional importance or great public importance;
* in cases where a conflict between decisions in the House of Lords (as a court), Privy Council (as a court) and/or the Supreme Court has to be reconciled; or
* in cases raising an important point in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights.
, only two cases have been heard by the maximum panel of 11 justices, both arising out of political events relating to Brexit: &quot;R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union&quot; (&quot;Miller I&quot;), which was heard by all 11 serving justices (there was one judicial vacancy at the time) and decided by an 8–3 majority, and &quot;R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland&quot; (&quot;Miller II&quot;), which was heard by 11 of the 12 serving justices (Lord Briggs did not sit) and decided unanimously.

== Japan ==
The Supreme Court of Japan, which has a total of fifteen justices, ordinarily hears cases in panels of five judges, but is required to hear cases en banc (by the &quot;Grand Bench&quot;, 大法廷 &quot;daihōtei&quot;) when ruling on most constitutional issues, when overturning a previous decision of the Supreme Court, when the five-judge panel is unable to reach a decision, and in other limited cases.

== Australia ==
Appeals to the High Court of Australia (the federal supreme court of Australia) are sometimes heard by the full bench of all seven justices. Cases that are heard by the full bench include cases of constitutional significance, or where the court is being asked to overrule a previous decision, or cases that involve principles of major public importance. 

The state supreme courts and the Federal Court of Australia often hear appeals by a &quot;full court&quot; of judges, but this does not normally include all the judges on the court. For example, in New South Wales, particularly important appeal cases are heard by five judges, chosen from a pool of more than a dozen appeal judges.

Some court buildings in Australia include a courtroom specifically called the &quot;banco court&quot;, which is a large courtroom where the judges of the court can sit &quot;en banc&quot; - with &quot;in banco&quot;, the Medieval Latin term, being preferred in Australia over the Norman French equivalent &quot;en banc&quot;. They are used for full bench hearings, as well as ceremonies.

== France ==
In France, the Court of Cassation (France&#x27;s highest judicial court) sometimes hears cases that represent very significant legal issues, as well as cases in which lower appeals courts have failed to apply its rulings as ordered, in a formation known as the &quot;Assemblée plénière&quot; (Plenary Session), but this does not include all the judges of the court (of which there can be up to 58). This consists of a nineteen-member panel composed of the Chief Justice of the Court of Cassation and three members from each of the Court&#x27;s six divisions.

Together with the Treaty of Paris, signed five days earlier, it marked the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War. The treaty ended the continental conflict with no significant changes in prewar borders. Austria and Saxony renounced all claims to the Silesian territories ceded to Prussia in the 1742 Treaty of Berlin and the 1745 Treaty of Dresden. Prussia clearly stood among the ranks of the European great powers, while the treaty enhanced the rivalry with Austria.

==Background==
Austria&#x27;s resolve to repossess the rich province of Silesia, which had been lost to Prussia in 1748, was the major conflict leading to the Seven Years&#x27; War. Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, acquired the support of Russia, Sweden, Saxony, Spain and France, with the specific aim of waging war against Prussia and its ally, Great Britain. It was King Frederick II of Prussia, however, who initiated the hostilities with his attack and capture of Saxony in 1756.

The Seven Years&#x27; War started in 1756, with Prussia facing the allied forces of Austria, Russia, France and Sweden. Although in January 1757, the majority of the colleges of the Imperial Diet (minus Hanover, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Brunswick and Saxe-Gotha) voted against the move for war, Frederick succeeded in his quest for expanding Prussian influence, power and territory.

Through the first half of the war, the Prussians continued victorious. In the Battle of Rossbach, on 5 November 1757, the Prussian army defeated the French and also Imperial troops. The Prussians defeated the Austrians at Leuthen later in 1757 and the Russians at Zorndorf in 1758.

However, with Sweden entering the war and virtually all of Europe opposing Frederick, the tide seemed to turn. By 1759 eastern Prussia was in the hands of the Russians, and Berlin was occupied for some weeks. Austrian forces had invaded Prussia from the south. Now seriously running short of soldiers, Frederick II was in a desperate situation.

In 1758, the Anglo-Hanoverian army, an ally of Prussia commanded by Ferdinand of Brunswick, defeated the French and occupied the town of Münster. In 1759 Imperial troops invaded Saxony and expelled the Prussians.

Two significant factors, however, led to the eventual return of Prussian dominance in the war. One was the active support of the British and Hanoverians, which had been ineffective combatants but now fought successfully against the French. The second and more important was the withdrawal in 1762 of Russia and Sweden from the war. That occurred as a result of the death of Empress Elizabeth of Russia; her successor, Peter III, an admirer of Frederick, quickly signed a peace treaty with him. By the Treaty of Saint Petersburg, Russia made peace and restored all conquests, and Sweden also made peace that year. This turn in fortune was labeled the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg.

Now fighting alone in the east, the Austrians were soundly defeated in the Battle of Burkersdorf (July 1762). The French, had suffered severe reverses as well. In America, they had lost Louisbourg (1758), Quebec (1759), and some possessions in the West Indies. In India, the British victories at Plassey (1757) and Pondichéry (1761) had destroyed France&#x27;s military capabilities there. On the sea, the French took Port Mahón from the British (1757) but were defeated by Hawke in Quiberon Bay (1759). The entry of Spain into the war under the terms of the Family Compact of 1761 was of little help to France, where the war had never been popular.

==Aftermath==
After protracted negotiations between the war-weary powers, peace was made among Prussia, Austria and Saxony at Hubertusburg and among Great Britain, France and Spain at Paris. The Treaty of Hubertusburg restored the prewar status quo but marked the ascendancy of Prussia as a leading European power. Through the Treaty of Paris, Great Britain emerged as the world&#x27;s chief colonial empire, which had been its primary goal in the war, and France lost most of its overseas possessions.

The phrase &quot;Hubertsburg Peace&quot; is sometimes used as a description for any treaty that restores the situation existing before conflict broke out.

<doc id="313034" wikidata="Q1114403" url="?curid=313034" title="Comic relief">
<text>Comic relief is the inclusion of a humorous character or scene or witty dialogue in an otherwise serious or dramatic work, often to relieve tension.

==Definition==
Comic relief usually means a releasing of emotional or other tension resulting from a comic episode interposed in the midst of serious or tragic elements in a drama. Comic relief often takes the form of, but is not limited to, a bumbling, ing sidekick of the hero or villain in a work of fiction. A sidekick used for comic relief will usually comment on the absurdity of the hero&#x27;s situation and make comments that would be inappropriate for a character who is to be taken seriously. Other characters may use comic relief as a means to irritate others or keep themselves confident.

==Application==
Sometimes comic relief characters will appear in fiction that is comic. This generally occurs when the work enters a dramatic moment, but the character continues to be comical regardless. External and internal comic reliefs can be separated based on the engagement within the story and the effect on the audience. An internal comic relief is a character or moment where the story is written in the story itself. Others are involved and can laugh along with the humor. While external comic relief moments occur whenever the audience is supposed to laugh but the characters do not.

==History==
In the classical tradition, the mingling of the tragic and the comic was not allowed.
Greek tragedy did not allow any comic relief in drama, but had a tradition of concluding a series of several tragic performances with a humorous satyr play. Even the Elizabethan critic Philip Sidney, following Horace’s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;, pleaded for the exclusion of comic elements from a tragic drama. However in Renaissance England, Christopher Marlowe, a member of the University Wits, introduced comic relief through the presentation of crude scenes in &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, following the native tradition of the interlude, which was usually introduced between two tragic plays.

==Function==
Comic relief moments serve the purpose of allowing the audience to &quot;break from the dark and heavy content&quot; and advance the plot.

==Examples==
William Shakespeare deviated from the classical tradition and used comic relief in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The grave-digger scene in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the gulling of Roderigo in &quot;Othello&quot;, and the mockery of the fool in &quot;King Lear&quot; provide immense comic relief.

Take the Porter scene in &quot;Macbeth&quot;:

&quot;Here&#x27;s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning the key…Who&#x27;s there, i&#x27; the name of Beelzebub? Here&#x27;s a farmer, that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you; here you&#x27;ll sweat for&#x27;t…Faith, here&#x27;s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose.&quot;

In this scene, the Porter serves as the comedic relief. In the scene before, King Duncan is murdered by the Macbeth duo. After the scene, his body is discovered and the castle is thrown into hysteria. His chaotic scene in between serves as a comic relief moment to distract the audience from the gruesome content.

<text>Team management is the ability of an individual or an organization to administer and coordinate a group of individuals to perform a task. Team management involves teamwork, communication, objective setting and performance appraisals. Moreover, team management is the capability to identify problems and resolve conflicts within a team. Teams are a popular approach to many business challenges. They can produce innovative solutions to complex problems. There are various methods and leadership styles a team manager can take to increase personnel productivity and build an effective team. In the workplace teams can come in many shapes and sizes who all work together and depend on one another. They communicate and all strive to accomplish a specific goal. Management teams are a type of team that performs duties such as managing and advising other employees and teams that work with them. Whereas work, parallel, and project teams hold the responsibility of direct accomplishment of a goal, management teams are responsible for providing general direction and assistance to those teams.

==Elements of a healthy and successful team==

===Cohesive leadership===
In any functional team, cohesion amongst team leaders and decision makers is vital. Cohesive leadership means that team leaders act together as a unit and make decisions as a team instead of each branching off into their own work and operating individually. It ensures that the team will be steered in one direction instead of multiple directions due to team leaders not being concise and consistent with their instructions. Cohesive leadership will require team leaders to have strong communication skills. Lastly, motivation fosters a sense of purpose, bringing individuals towards a common goal. When team members are driven by a passion, it creates a cohesive environment. Cohesiveness promotes collaboration support, and synergy which brings motivation and strength that can bond the overall group&#x27;s cohesiveness.

===Effective communication===
Effective communication is the centerstone of successful team management. Ensuring clear goals and expectations opens opportunities that enables a collaborative environment, allowing team members to share ideas and feedback seamlessly. A well communicated team is better prepared to overcome challenges and make informed decisions. There must be an effective channel of communication(or Organizational communication) from the top to the bottom of the chain of command and vice versa. An effective channel of communication will allow messages to be transferred accurately without delay to the intended recipient, which will speed up decision making processes and the operations of the team. Furthermore, effective communication will increase the flexibility of an organization and cause it to be less susceptible to changes in the external environment, as a faster decision making process will allow organizations a longer time period to adapt to the changes and execute contingency plans. The use of social media at work positively influences three team processes, specifically the effective communication, knowledge sharing and coordination.

===Common goal===
In a group setting, common goals act as a binding force. Aligning skills and efforts towards a shared objective provides a cohesive setting. Ensuring everyone is working towards a unified purpose creates common goals that enhance group efficiency, foster teamwork, and contribute to a sense of camaraderie, ultimately leading to success. When team members first come together, they will each bring different ideas; however, the key to a successful team is the alignment of its objectives. It is essential that the team leader sets a common goal the entire team is willing to pursue. This way, all of the team members will put in effort in order to attain the goal. If there is not a common goal, team members who disagree with the objective in hand will feel reluctant to utilize their full effort, leading to failure to achieve the goal. In other cases, team members might divert themselves to other tasks due to a lack of belief or interest in the goal.

===Defined team roles and responsibilities===
Poorly defined roles are often the biggest obstacle to a successful team. If team members are unclear what their role is, their contributions will be minimal, therefore it is the team leader&#x27;s duty to outline the roles and responsibilities of each individual within the team and ensure that they work together as an integral unit.

In a successful team, a leader will first evaluate the team&#x27;s mission to understand what is needed to accomplish the task. Then, they will identify the strengths and weaknesses of the team members and assign roles accordingly. Lastly, they must ensure that all team members know what each other&#x27;s responsibilities are to avoid confusion and to create an effective channel of communication.

Individuals in a team can take on different roles that have their own unique responsibilities. A task-oriented role occurs when the individual offers new ideas, coordinates activities, or tries to find new information to share with the team. A social-oriented role occurs when an individual encourages the members of the team to be united. They also encourage participation and communication. An individual role occurs when an individual blocks the team&#x27;s activities. They tend to call attention to themselves and avoid interaction with others. Another occurrence is role conflict, which is a situation where an individual faces divergent role expectation. This means they are being pulled in various directions and hold different roles simultaneously.

==Methods of team management==

===Command and Control===
The &quot;command and control” method as an approach to team management is based on the concept of military management. It was a commonly used system in the private sector during the 21st century. In this method, the team leader instructs their team members to complete a task and if they refuse, they will punish employees until they comply. The team leader has absolute authority and utilises an autocratic leadership style. There are considerable drawbacks to this team management method. First, morale is lowered due to team members being belittled for the slightest mistakes; punishments lead to a lack of confidence resulting in poor performance. Second, in modern organisations roles are often specialised, therefore managers will require the expertise of the employee, elevating the value of the employee. Implementing this team management method leads to a high rate of employee turnover. In addition, in large organisations managers don&#x27;t have the time to provide instructions to all employees and continuously monitor them; this will impede an organisation&#x27;s performance as managers are not spending time on their core responsibilities.

===Engage and Create===
Due to the limiting nature of the &quot;command and control” method, managers developed an alternative management strategy known as “engage and create”. In this method team members are encouraged to participate in discussions and contribution.This yield better results. Engaged employees are inspiring to be around, excellent at their jobs, and essential to the success. Engagement and creating share similarities as both involve participation and support. When team members are engaged, they are invested in their work and the overall goals of the team. Creating, on the other hand, often involves generating new ideas and solutions. Together, they form a solid combination for team management. Engaged team members are more likely to contribute creatively which can lead to problem solving, productivity, and a positive work environment. Ultimately enhancing overall team performance to reach the team&#x27;s goals.

===Econ 101===
In the “econ 101” method of team management, the team leader makes the baseline assumption that all team members are motivated by reward in the form of money, and that the best way to manage the team is to provide financial rewards for performance and issue punishments for failure. This method of team management uses material gains in the place of intrinsic motivation to drive team members. This is similar to Frederick Taylor&#x27;s theory of scientific management which claims the main form of motivation for employees is money. The main drawback of this method is that it does not take into account other forms of motivation besides money such as personal satisfaction and ambition. Moreover, using reward and punishment as a method of team management can cause demotivation as everyone is motivated by different factors and there is no one way to satisfy all team members; the negative effect is further compounded by punishment leading to demoralisation and loss of confidence.

==Problems in team management==

===Absence of trust===
In Patrick Lencioni&#x27;s book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, the absence of vulnerability-based trust – where team members are comfortable being vulnerable with each other, trust each other to help when asking for guidance, and are willing to admit their mistakes – within a team is detrimental to a team. Team leaders have to assist each other when they are vulnerable and also allow team members to see their vulnerable side, which is contradictory to the orthodox belief. If a team lacks vulnerability-based trust, team members will not be willing to share ideas or acknowledge their faults due to the fear of being exposed as incompetent, leading to a lack of communication and the hindering of the team. To make vulnerability-based trust part of who you are, practice following these three steps. First, understand your vulnerabilities by looking at your past experiences and how they’ve affected you. Second, take that and create open communication where you and others can share thoughts and feelings. Lastly, view vulnerability as a way to grow stronger. By doing these things, you will build trust within yourself and your colleagues, making it a natural part of your personality and forming meaningful connections throughout your time.

===Fear of conflict===
Contrary to general belief, conflict is a positive element in a team as it drives discussion. The fear of conflict is the fear of team members to argue with one another or disagree with the team leader. If team members hold back and are afraid of confronting their leader or teammates, then the concept of a team is non-existent because there is only one person who contributes and no new ideas are generated from discussions.

The fear of conflict in a team stems from an absence of trust, more specifically vulnerability-based trust. If team members are afraid to be vulnerable in front of one another, disputes can be manipulative and a means to overthrow and shame the other team member. However, if team members trust each other and are comfortable being vulnerable in front of one another, then debates can be a pursuit of a better and more effective method to achieve a task.

===Lack of commitment===
When team members don&#x27;t provide input on a decision, it shows that they do not agree or approve of the decision, leading to a halt in team activity and progress. Furthermore, when team members don&#x27;t express their opinions, views and potential ideas are lost, hurting the project and the team. Effective communication is crucial for the success of any team. Poor communication leads to missed deadlines, conflict, and unhappy individuals. Team members should feel free to bounce ideas off of each other and provide feedback to improve the team.

===Avoidance of accountability===
The avoidance of accountability in a team is the failure of team members to be accountable for the consequences of their actions. When team members do not commit to a decision, they will be unwilling to take responsibility for the outcomes of the decision.

In addition, if a lack of trust exists within the team then there will be an absence of peer to peer accountability; team members will not feel accountable towards their team members and hence will not put effort into their tasks. The team must trust and hold each other responsible so that the intention will always be for the benefit of the team and for the team to succeed.

Team leaders who are afraid of confrontation might avoid holding team members accountable when in fact they have made a mistake. Team leaders must develop the confidence to hold team members accountable so that they will feel the sense of responsibility and entitlement to the team, and learn from their mistakes. If not, then errors will not be corrected and might lead to worse problems, causing a defective team.

===Inattention to results===
If team leaders and team members do not hold each other accountable then they will not be concerned about the outcome of the team and whether they have achieved their goal, as they do not have a drive to obtain great results. Inattention to results causes a loss of purpose and brings into question the existence of the team.

==Resolving problems through team management==

===Building trust===
An approach to resolving fundamental trust problems within teams is to build trust amongst team members. A team leader can build trust by persuading team members to ask questions and seek guidance from other team members so that they are more familiar and comfortable in being vulnerable with one another. This may include questions such as “Could you teach me how to do this?” or statements like “You are better than me at this”. However, in order to achieve vulnerability-based trust within the team, the team leader must be vulnerable first. If the team leader is unwilling to be vulnerable, the rest of the team will be unwilling to follow.

===Appraisals===
Appraisals can be a way for team members to provide feedback to one another or for team members to provide advice to the leader. This allows individual members of the team to reflect on their performance and aim to do better by amending their mistakes; furthermore appraisals create an environment where the chain of command is non-existent and team members can be honest towards one another. This is effective in a way that the team can provide progressive feedback towards other members and can advise the leader on how he or she can improve their leadership. After each member reads their appraisals, they will understand how they can strive to improve, benefitting the team in reaching its objectives. The commonly used forms of appraisals are performance appraisals, peer appraisals and 360 degree feedback.

===Team building activities===
Team-building activities are a series of simple exercises involving teamwork and communication. The main objectives of team building activities are to increase trust amongst team members and allow team members to better understand one another. When choosing or designing team-building activities it is best to determine if your team needs an event or an experience. Generally an event is fun, quick and easily done by non-professionals. Team building experiences provide richer, more meaningful results. Experiences should be facilitated by a professional on an annual basis for teams that are growing, or changing.

===What makes teams effective===
Team effectiveness occurs when the team has appropriate goals to complete and the confidence to accomplish those goals. Communication is also a large part of effectiveness in a team because in order to accomplish tasks, the members must negotiate ideas and information. Another aspect of effectiveness is and trust. When overcoming the “storming” phase of Bruce Tuckman&#x27;s stages of group development, trust is established, and it leads to higher levels of team cohesion and effectiveness. If there is a conflict, effectiveness allows cohesion and the ability to overcome conflict. Specifically in management teams, more weight falls on their shoulders because they have to direct and lead other teams. Being effective is a main priority for the team or teams involved. Unlike non-managerial teams, in which the focus is on a set of team tasks, management teams are effective only insofar as they are accomplishing a high level of performance by a significant business unit or an entire firm. Having support from higher-up position leaders can give teams insight on how to act and make decisions, which improves their effectiveness as well.

<text>Lake Neuchâtel ( ; ; ) is a lake primarily in Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. The lake lies mainly in the canton of Neuchâtel, but is also shared by the cantons of Vaud, Fribourg, and Bern. It comprises one of the lakes in the Three Lakes Region (French: &quot;Pays des Trois-Lacs&quot;, German: &quot;Drei-Seen-Land&quot;), along with lakes Biel/Bienne and Morat/Murten.

With a surface of , Lake Neuchâtel is the largest lake located entirely in Switzerland and the 59th largest lake in Europe. It is long and at its widest. Its surface is above sea level, and the maximum depth is . The total water volume is . The lake&#x27;s drainage area is approximately and its culminating point is Le Chasseron at .

In comparison to the Lake Geneva region, the Lake Neuchatel shoreline has experienced significant economic development with the completion of the regional motorway network. It is also known to have housed a Celtic agglomeration on pile-dwellings called La Tène and which gives its name to the second Iron Age.

The lake is fed by the rivers L&#x27;Orbe (called La Thielle or La Thièle locally, downstream of the city of Orbe), &quot;L&#x27;Arnon&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Areuse&quot;, &quot;Le Seyon&quot;, and &quot;La Menthue&quot;, as well as by the &quot;Canal de la Broye&quot;. The Thielle Canal (, ) drains the lake into Lake Biel and is part of regulation system for the lakes and the rivers of the Seeland region.

Lake Neuchâtel was the home of the now extinct species of deepwater trout &quot;Salvelinus neocomensis&quot;.

== Geography ==
Lake Neuchatel is situated at the foot of the Jura mountain range, on the Swiss Plateau. Mainly in the French-speaking Swiss Romande, it borders the territory of four cantons: Neuchâtel (), Vaud (), Fribourg () and Bern ().

The lake&#x27;s main tributaries are the Thiele and the Broye canal which connect it to Lake Morat. It flows into Lake Biel via the Thielle canal (German: &quot;Zihlkanal&quot;).

Since the Jura water correction in the 19th and 20th centuries, it has served, together with Lake Morat, as a compensation basin for the waters of the Aare flowing into Lake Biel. Indeed, if the level of the latter rises too much, the flow may stop or even go in the opposite direction.

Lake Neuchâtel is long and has a maximum width of . Its maximum depth is and its capacity is estimated at . It is the largest lake located entirely on Swiss territory, considering that Lake Geneva and Lake Constance are shared with neighboring countries.

In the summer of 2021, Lake Neuchatel reached historically high water levels due to widespread flooding over mainland Europe.

== History and prehistory ==
The lake was frequented by prehistoric man as evidenced by the remains (site of the Auvernier lake resort and archeological museum, the Laténium) where bones of brown bear and Eurasian beaver were also found (two species then almost ubiquitous in Europe). Several megalithic monuments line the lake such as the alignment of Clendy and the menhirs of Gorgier, Grandson, Saint-Aubin-Sauges, and Vauroux, as well as an imposing erratic block, the .

When the first Swiss towns appear, Mont Vully, which was a large fortified area of around 50 hectares built around 120 BCE, controlled the lakes of Morat and Neuchâtel while the La Tène area remained nearly unoccupied. What is now Yverdon-les-Bains was located on a barrier island on the other side of the lake, a place of smaller settlement (3 to 4 hectares) occupied from the 4th century BCE, and later fortified in 80 BCE by means of a long and solid rampart with frontal posts (like that of Vully), before this oppidum (&quot;Eburodunum&quot;) becomes a &quot;vicus&quot; in the first centuries CE.

The first written mention of the lake dates from the year 998 CE, where a &quot;laci everdunensis&quot; (or lake of Yverdon, from its Latin name &quot;Eburodunum&quot;) is mentioned, near which the priory of Bevaix was founded. The name dominates throughout the Middle Ages, co-utilized with the current term &quot;Lake Neuchâtel&quot;, however, is frequent from the 15th century onwards. The latter became dominant during the 19th century, in particular with the lowering of the level of the lake and the development of the Vaudois railway, which reduced the importance of the Port of Yverdon.

The Swiss Air Force used the lake for bombing practice until 2021, leaving an estimated 4,500 tons of munitions in its waters. Some of these munitions are located as close as six or seven meters below the surface.

Lake Neuchâtel, and in particular the town of Neuchâtel became a popular tourist destination during the Belle Époque period due to its climate and panoramic views of the Alps.

<doc id="313050" wikidata="Q2608804" url="?curid=313050" title="Silver Fox (character)">
<text>Silver Fox is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She works for the terrorist organization HYDRA and is also known as a former love interest for Wolverine.

Lynn Collins portrays Silver Fox in the 2009 film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;.

==Publication history==
Silver Fox first appeared in &quot;Wolverine&quot; vol. 2 #10, and was created by Chris Claremont and John Buscema.

==Fictional character biography==
Silver Fox is a member of the First Nation Blackfoot Confederacy. In the early to late 1900s, she lived with Wolverine as his lover in Canada. She was allegedly murdered by Sabretooth on Wolverine&#x27;s birthday, but is later revealed to be alive and a member of the covert ops Team X. Fox eventually betrays Team X and becomes a member of HYDRA, a subversive terrorist organization.

Silver Fox reappears during the modern period when Wolverine tracks down each member of the Weapon X staff, discovering the studios where many of his memories, which he believes to be real, were staged. Allegedly she kills the professor who had been in charge of the program after Logan left. At this point it is revealed that Silver Fox is in command of a section of HYDRA.

Shortly thereafter, Silver Fox captures the assassin Reiko, and forms an alliance with Reiko&#x27;s boss, Hand Jonin Matsu&#x27;o Tsurayaba. Matsu&#x27;o is in the process of trying to buy Clan Yashida&#x27;s underworld connections before Mariko Yashida severs them entirely. Silver Fox dupes Reiko into poisoning Mariko, giving Matsu&#x27;o what he wanted. Silver Fox&#x27;s motivations in this are unclear.

Later, when Mastodon, a member of the Weapon X Program, dies due to the failure of his anti-aging factor, Silver Fox reunites with Logan, Creed, Maverick, and Wraith. She is cold to Logan, and seems not to remember having spent any pleasant time with him. The group infiltrates a secret base and confronts the man who had implanted them with their false memories: Aldo Ferro, the Psi-Borg. After Carol Hines dies of fright at the hands of Ferro&#x27;s transformation, Ferro takes control of their minds and this time makes Creed kill Silver Fox. After Ferro&#x27;s defeat, Silver Fox was to be buried in Salem Center. At the church, Logan discovered that her body has been prepared for flight. The father at the church notifies Logan that &quot;a brick wall with an eyepatch&quot; gave the order. Suddenly, a S.H.I.E.L.D. carrier arrives with Nick Fury, who states he never imagined the day when a top-ranking HYDRA member would get a full honors S.H.I.E.L.D. burial. Wraith appears as well, having orchestrated the entire funeral, stating &quot;Salem Center meant nothing to her&quot;. Wraith tells Logan that they found the cabin where he really had lived with Silver Fox a lifetime ago. He gets permission to bury her there, by himself with only a shovel and uses the part of the door with &quot;Silver Fox + Logan&quot; in a heart that he had carved into it as a headstone.

Before beheading Sabretooth, Wolverine expresses his doubt on whether or not the events of Silver Fox&#x27;s return actually happened, but admits the pain and loss he felt during that time was real.

<text>The Golestan Palace (, &quot;Kākh-e Golestān&quot;), also transliterated as the Gulistan Palace and sometimes translated as the Rose Garden Palace from Persian language, was built in the 16th century, renovated in the 18th century and finally rebuilt in 1865. It is the former official royal Qajar complex in Tehran.

One of the oldest historic monuments in the city of Tehran, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Golestan Palace belongs to a group of royal buildings that were once enclosed within the mud-thatched walls of Tehran&#x27;s arg (&quot;citadel&quot;). It consists of gardens, royal buildings, and collections of Iranian crafts and European gifts from the 18th and 19th centuries.

==History==

The origin of the Tehran&#x27;s royal citadel can be traced back to July 6, 1404; when Ruy González de Clavijo, the envoy of Enrique III, traveled to Samarkand to meet with Timur, and he chose to stay at the house of Baba Sheikh (one of the elders of Tehran). It is believed that his house was located in the area of the royal citadel and later they were transformed into new buildings with changes. The beginning of the royal citadel can be traced back to the time of Suleiman I, with the construction of a palace in the Chenaristan area, a Divankhane where Soltan Hoseyn in the last year of his reign meet with the Ottoman government&#x27;s ambassador, Ahmad Dari Effendi. Tehran&#x27;s arg (&quot;citadel&quot;) was built during the reign of Tahmasp I (r. 1524–1576) of the Safavid dynasty (1502–1736). Abbas the Great built a large garden in the northern part of the fence, which was later surrounded by a high wall and buildings were built, with the royal residence was built inside it. At the end of the Safavid era, Tehran was sometimes the temporary seat of the court of Safavid kings. The palace was later renovated by Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty (r. 1750–1779). Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty (1742–1797) chose Tehran as his capital. The arg became the seat of the Qajars (1794–1925). The court and palace of Golestan became the official residence of the Qajar dynasty. The palace was rebuilt to its current form in 1865 by Haji Ab ol Hasan Mimar Navai.

During the Pahlavi era (1925–1979), the Golestan Palace was used for formal receptions. The Pahlavi dynasty built their own palaces in the Niavaran and Sa&#x27;dabad palace complexes. The most important ceremonies held in the palace during the Pahlavi era were the coronations of Reza Shah in 1926 and Mohammad Reza Shah and Shahbanu Farah in 1967. In between 1925 and 1945, a large portion of the buildings of the complex were destroyed by the order of Reza Shah. He believed that centuries-old Qajar palaces should not hinder the growth of a modern city. In the place of the old buildings, commercial buildings with the modern style of 1950s and 1960s were erected.

==Sites==
The Golestan Palace Complex consists of 17 structures, including palaces, museums, and halls. Almost all of this complex was built during the 131 year rule of the Qajar dynasty. These palaces were used for many occasions such as coronations and other important celebrations. It also consists of three main archives, including the photographic archive, the library of manuscripts, and the archive of documents.

===Marble Throne (Takht-e Marmar)===
This terrace, known as the Marble Throne, was built in 1747-1751.

===Karim Khani Nook (Khalvat-e Karim Khani)===
Dating back to 1759, this building was a part of the interior residence of Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty. The basic structure of the Karim Khani Nook is similar to the Marble Throne. Like the latter, it is a terrace. There is a small marble throne inside the terrace. The structure is much smaller than the Marble Throne and it has much less ornamentation. There was once a small pond with a fountain in the middle of this terrace. Water from a subterranean stream (the shah&#x27;s qanat) flowed from the fountain into the pond and was later used to irrigate the palace grounds.

Naser al-Din Shah Qajar was fond of this corner of the Golestan Palace.

===Pond House (Howz Khaneh)===

The Pond House was used as a summer chamber during the Qajar era. Works of European painters presented to the Qajar court are housed there. 
===Brilliant Hall (Talar-e Brelian)===

The Brilliant Hall was built by the order of Naser ed Din Shah. It is named so as it features brilliant Iranian mirror-work called Ayeneh-kari.

===Containers&#x27; Hall (Talar-e Zoruf)===
This building replaced the building of Narenjestan in the north of the Ivory Hall (Talar-e Adj).

===Ivory Hall (Talar-e Adj)===
Ivory Hall is a large hall used as a dining room. It was decorated with some gifts presented to Naser ed Din Shah by European monarchs.

===Mirror Hall (Talar-e Aineh)===

The Mirror Hall is a relatively small hall designed by Haj Abd ol Hossein &quot;Memar Bashi&quot; (Sanie ol Molk).

===Salam Hall (Talar-e Salam)===

The Salam (&quot;Reception&quot;) Hall was originally designed to be a museum.

===Diamond Hall (Talar-e Almas)===
The Diamond Hall is located in the southern wing of the Golestan Palace, next to the Windcatcher Mansion.

===The Windcatcher Mansion (Emarat-e Badgir)===

The Windcatcher Mansion was constructed during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. The building underwent major renovations, including structural changes, during the reign of Naser ed Din Shah.

===Edifice of the Sun (Shams-ol-Emareh)===

The Edifice of the Sun was designed by Moayer ol Mamalek. Construction on this building began in 1865 and was completed in two years. A clock presented by Queen Victoria to Naser al-Din Shah and mounted atop the building was repaired in 2012.

===Museum of Gifts===

This building is located under the Salam Hall.

===Abyaz Palace===

The Qajar monarch had the Abyaz Palace constructed.

===Museum Hall===
The original collection of the Museum Hall is now scattered among Tehran&#x27;s many museums.

===Photographic archive===

There is an early photographic collection at the Golestan complex which includes photos which are mainly related to the time of the 19th-century progress of photography in Europe. It was created by the order of Naser ed Din Shah. It is mentioned that &quot;photography was so common at the royal palace that the king&#x27;s wives and his servants also took pictures and posed playfully in front of the camera.&quot; There is a picture of one servant with flowers decorating his head and shoulders.

==Present use==

On 11 October 2005, the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran submitted the palace to the UNESCO for inclusion into the World Heritage List in 2007. On 23 June 2013, it was proclaimed as world heritage site during the UNESCO meeting in Phnom Penh.

The Golestan Palace is currently operated by the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran.

<doc id="313055" wikidata="Q5620634" url="?curid=313055" title="Mere addition paradox">
<text>The mere addition paradox (also known as the repugnant conclusion) is a problem in ethics identified by Derek Parfit and discussed in his book &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; (1984). The paradox identifies the mutual incompatibility of four intuitively compelling assertions about the relative value of populations. Parfit’s original formulation of the repugnant conclusion is that &quot;For any perfectly equal population with very high positive welfare, there is a population with very low positive welfare which is better, other things being equal.&quot;

==The paradox==

Parfit considers four populations, as depicted in the following diagram: A, A+, B− and B. Each bar represents a distinct group of people. The bars&#x27; width represents group size while the bar&#x27;s height represents group happiness. Unlike A and B, A+ and B− are complex populations, each comprising two distinct groups of people. It is also stipulated that the lives of the members of each group are good enough that they would rather be alive than not exist.

Parfit makes the following three suggestions regarding the value of the populations: 

::1. A+ seems no worse than A. This is because the people in A are no worse-off in A+, while the additional people who exist in A+ are better off in A+ compared to A, since it is stipulated that their lives are good enough that it is better for them to be alive than to not exist.

::2. B− seems better than A+. This is because B− has greater total and average happiness than A+.

::3. B seems equally as good as B−, as the only difference between B− and B is that the two groups in B− are merged to form one group in B.

Together, these three comparisons entail that B is better than A. However, Parfit also observes the following: 

::4. When we directly compare A (a population with high average happiness) and B (a population with lower average happiness, but more total happiness because of its larger population), it may seem that B can be worse than A.

Thus, there is a paradox. The following intuitively plausible claims are jointly incompatible: (1) that A+ is no worse than A, (2) that B− is better than A+, (3) that B− is as good as B, and (4) that B can be worse than A.

=== The repugnant conclusion ===

Parfit argues that this mere addition from A to B can be repeated over and over, eventually resulting in a much larger population Z with only slightly positive welfare. The assessment that such a population Z would be better is what Parfit calls the repugnant conclusion.

==Responses==
Some scholars, such as Larry Temkin and Stuart Rachels, argue that inconsistencies between the four claims (above) rely on the assumption that the &quot;better than&quot; relation is transitive. The inconsistency could then be resolved by rejecting the assumption. According to this view, although A+ is no worse than A, and B− is better than A+, it does not follow that B− is better than A.

Another response is the conclusion that total utilitarianism must be rejected in favour of average utilitarianism, which would result in situation A+ being evaluated as worse than A, as the average happiness is lower. According to Parfit, this would however lead to an absurd conclusion, as it implies that adding people with lives worth living would make the world worse simply because they lower the average quality of life.

Torbjörn Tännsjö argues that the intuition that B is worse than A is wrong. While the lives of those in B are worse than those in A, there are more of them, and thus the collective value of B is greater than A. Michael Huemer also argues that the repugnant conclusion is not repugnant.

A number of philosophers (including Torbjörn Tännsjö, Yew-Kwang Ng, Hilary Greaves and Toby Ord) have agreed that avoiding the repugnant conclusion is not a necessary criterion for a satisfactory theory of population ethics.

== Variants ==
The Very Repugnant Conclusion is a property of theories of population ethics that is a stronger version of the repugnant conclusion. It states that according to some ethical theories, for any population where everyone has very high well-being, there exists a better population consisting of two groups: a significant number of people with very negative well-being, and a much larger number of people having barely positive welfare.

==Alternative usage==
An alternative use of the term &quot;mere addition paradox&quot; was presented in a paper by Hassoun in 2010. It identifies paradoxical reasoning that occurs when certain statistical measures are used to calculate results over a population. For example, if a group of 100 people together control $100 worth of resources, the average wealth per capita is $1. If a single rich person then arrives with 1 million dollars, then the total group of 101 people controls $1,000,100, making average wealth per capita $9,901, implying a drastic shift away from poverty even though nothing has changed for the original 100 people. Hassoun defines a &quot;no mere addition axiom&quot; to be used for judging such statistical measures: &quot;merely adding a rich person to a population should not decrease poverty&quot; (although acknowledging that in actual practice adding rich people to a population may provide some benefit to the whole population).

<text>The Royal Danish Ballet (Danish: &quot;Den Kongelige Ballet&quot;) is an internationally renowned classical ballet company, based at the Royal Danish Theatre in Kongens Nytorv, Copenhagen, Denmark. It is one of the oldest ballet companies in the world and originates from 1748, when the Royal Danish Theatre was founded. It was finally organized in 1771 in response to the great popularity of French and Italian styles of dance. The company was founded with the opening of the Royal Danish Theatre, which has served as its home since that time. The Royal Danish Ballet school was founded in 1771 under the leadership of French ballet teacher Pierre Laurent (1730–1807), then Vincenzo Galeotti developed it and August Bournonville founded his methodology for the school.

==History==

From the outset, the Royal Danish Ballet employed some of the leading French and Italian dancers and choreographers. Within a few years of its founding, in 1771, the Royal Theater Ballet School or Royal Danish Ballet school was established to provide native dancers, of which one of the first was Anine Frølich. One of its early masters, Vincenzo Galeotti, is considered the veritable founder of the company. He was master of the company from 1775 to 1816, and introduced ballet d&#x27;action and prepared for the advent of romantic ballet. Galeotti is credited with choreographing &quot;Amors og Balletmesterens Luner (The Whims of Cupid and the Ballet Master&quot;), which is still part of the company&#x27;s repertoire and is the world&#x27;s oldest ballet still performed with its original choreography.

Another major master of the troupe was the Danish dancer August Bournonville. During the half-century that Bournonville led the company (1828–1879), he choreographed some fifty ballets, of which about a dozen are still part of the company&#x27;s repertoire. The works are highly influenced by the French school of dance, since Bournonville studied in that country, and include key roles for male dancers, undoubtedly written with himself in mind. After his death, one of his successors, Hans Beck, used the basic steps he learned in Bournonville&#x27;s classes to create the Bournonville school to teach contemporary dancers the tradition of the old master.

The third great period of the Danish Royal Ballet came in 1932, when Harald Lander took over the helm of the corps. Trained in the United States and the Soviet Union, he both adapted traditional ballets and choreographed original works for the company. He encouraged local choreographers, who went on to create prominent works that won international acclaim. Among them was Børge Ralov, who choreographed the first modern Danish Ballet, &quot;The Widow in the Mirror&quot;, in 1934. He also trained many prominent international dancers, including Erik Bruhn.

A prominent company director was Henning Kronstam (1978–1982), who directed the 1979 Bournonville Festival.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the Royal Danish Ballet underwent another transformation, with many internationally prominent choreographers, including George Balanchine, commissioned to work with it. Though modern works assumed increasingly important stature in the repertoire, the ballet continued to remain loyal to its classical roots as well, earning it the reputation as one of the finest corps of dancers in the world, incorporating foreign as well as native-born talent.

In 2007 the appointment of New York City Ballet principal dancer Nikolaj Hübbe as artistic director was announced.

<text>Samuel Prescott Bush (October 4, 1863 – February 8, 1948) was an American steel industry executive and the patriarch of the Bush family. He was the father of U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, the paternal grandfather of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush, the patrilineal great-grandfather of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.

After graduating from the Stevens Institute of Technology, he established himself as one of the leading industrialists of his era.

==Early life==
Bush was born in Brick Church, Orange, New Jersey, to Harriet Eleanor Fay (1829–1924) and Reverend James Smith Bush (1825–1889), an Episcopal priest at Grace Church in Orange. His siblings were James Freeman Bush (1860–1913), Harold Montfort Bush (1871–1945), and Eleanor Bush Woods (1872–1957).
He grew up in New Jersey, San Francisco, and Staten Island, but spent the majority of his adult life in Columbus, Ohio.

==Career==
Bush graduated from the Stevens Institute of Technology at Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1884, where he played on one of the earliest regular college football teams. He took an apprenticeship with the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad at the Logansport, Indiana, shops, later transferring to Dennison, Ohio, and Columbus, Ohio, where in 1891 he became Master Mechanic, then in 1894 Superintendent of Motive Power. In 1899, he moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to take the Superintendent of Motive Power position with the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad.

In 1901, Bush returned to Columbus to be general manager of Buckeye Steel Castings Company, which manufactured railway parts. The company was run by Frank Rockefeller, the brother of oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, and among its clients were the railroads controlled by E. H. Harriman. The Bush and Harriman families were closely associated at least until the end of World War II. In 1908, Rockefeller retired and Bush became president of Buckeye, a position held until 1927, becoming one of the top industrialists of his generation.

Bush was the first president of the Ohio Manufacturers Association, and cofounder of the Columbus Academy. Additionally, he was the co-founder of the Scioto Country Club, a golf club in Columbus, Ohio.

===Political prominence===
In the spring of 1918, banker Bernard Baruch was asked to reorganize the War Industries Board during World War I, and placed several prominent businessmen in key posts. Bush became chief of the Ordnance, Small Arms, and Ammunition Section, with national responsibility for government assistance to and relations with munitions companies.

Bush served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (as well as of the Huntington National Bank of Columbus). In 1931, he was appointed to Herbert Hoover&#x27;s President&#x27;s Committee for Unemployment Relief, chaired by Walter S. Gifford, then-president of AT&amp;T. He was once recommended to serve on the board of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, but Hoover did not feel he was sufficiently known nationally.
==Personal life==
On June 20, 1894, he married Flora Sheldon (1872–1920), the daughter of Robert Emmet Sheldon (1845–1917) and Mary Elizabeth Butler (1850–1897). Her maternal grandfather was Courtland Philip Livingston Butler (1812–1891), a member of the Livingston family. Together, they had five children:

* Prescott Sheldon Bush (1895–1972), a US Senator, who married Dorothy Walker (1901–1992), daughter of George Herbert Walker; he was the father of President George Herbert Walker Bush and grandfather of President George Walker Bush.
* Robert Sheldon Bush (1896–1900), who died in childhood.
* Mary Eleanor Bush (1897–1992), who married Francis &quot;Frank&quot; House.
* Margaret Livingston Bush (1899–1993), who married Stuart Holmes Clement (1895–1974) in 1919.
* James Smith Bush (1901–1978), a director of the Export–Import Bank, and president of the Northwest International Bank.

His wife, Flora, died on September 4, 1920, in Narragansett, Rhode Island, when she was hit by a car. He later married Martha Bell Carter (1879–1950) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Bush died on February 8, 1948, aged 84, in Columbus. He is interred at Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus.

<text>Acanthuridae are a family of ray-finned fish which includes surgeonfishes, tangs, and [[Naso (fish)|unicornfishes]]. The family includes about 86 extant species of marine fish living in tropical seas, usually around coral reefs. Many of the species are brightly colored and popular in aquaria.

==Etymology and taxonomic history==
The name of the family is derived from the Greek words &quot;akantha&quot; and &quot;oura&quot;, which loosely translate to &quot;thorn&quot; and &quot;tail&quot;, respectively. This refers to the distinguishing characteristic of the family, the &quot;scalpel&quot; found on the caudal peduncle. In the early 1900s, the family was called Hepatidae.

==Subfamilies and genera==

Acanthuridae contains the following extant subfamilies and genera:
* Subfamily Nasinae 
** Genus &quot;Naso&quot; 
* Subfamily Acanthurinae 
** Tribe Acanthurini 
*** Genus &quot;Acanthurus&quot; 
*** Genus &quot;Ctenochaetus&quot; 
** Tribe Prionurini 
*** Genus &quot;Prionurus&quot; 
** Tribe Zebrasomini 
*** Genus &quot;Paracanthurus&quot; 
*** Genus &quot;Zebrasoma&quot; 

=== Evolution and fossil record ===
There are several extinct genera known from fossils dating from the Eocene to Miocene:

==== Eocene genera ====
A particularly large diversity of fossil surgeonfish is known from the Monte Bolca &quot;lagerstatte&quot; of Italy. These represent some of the earliest representatives of the individual tribes within the Acanthuridae.
*†&quot;Acanthuroides&quot; 
*†&quot;Eorandallius&quot; (=&quot;Naseus&quot; (preocc.))
*†&quot;Frigosorbinia&quot; 
*†&quot;Gazolaichthys&quot; 
*†&quot;Lehmanichthys&quot; 
*†&quot;Metacanthurus&quot; 
*†&quot;Metaspisurus&quot; 
*†&quot;Padovathurus&quot; 
*†&quot;Pesciarichthys&quot; 
*†&quot;Proacanthurus&quot; 
*†&quot;Protozebrasoma&quot; 
*†&quot;Sorbinithurus&quot; 
*†&quot;Tauichthys&quot; 
*†&quot;Tylerichthys&quot; 

==== Oligocene genera ====
*†&quot;Arambourgthurus&quot; 
*†&quot;Caprovesposus&quot; 
*†&quot;Glarithurus&quot; 
*?†&quot;Eonaso&quot; 

==== Miocene genera ====
*†&quot;Marosichthys&quot; 

==Morphology==

The distinctive characteristic of the family is that they have scalpel-like modified scales, one or more on either side of the peduncle of the tail. The spines are dangerously sharp and may seriously injure anyone who carelessly handles such a fish. The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are large, extending for most of the length of the body. The mouths are small and have a single row of teeth adapted to grazing on algae.

Surgeonfishes sometimes feed as solitary individuals, but they often travel and feed in schools. Feeding in schools may be a mechanism for overwhelming the highly aggressive defense responses of small territorial damselfishes that vigorously guard small patches of algae on coral reefs.
Most species are fairly small, with a maximum length of , but some in the genus &quot;Acanthurus&quot;, some in the genus &quot;Prionurus&quot;, and most species in the genus &quot;Naso&quot; may grow larger; the whitemargin unicornfish (&quot;Naso annulatus&quot;) is the largest species in the family, reaching a length of up to . These fishes may grow quickly in aquaria, so average growth size and suitability should be checked before adding them to any marine aquarium.

A larval acanthurid, known as an acronurus, looks strikingly different from the juvenile and adult forms of the same individual. It is mostly transparent and tends to have a pelagic lifestyle, living in open water for an extended period of time before settling on the ocean bottom near the shore, where it develops into the juvenile and ultimately the adult form.

==Symbiotic bacteria==
Acanthurids are the only known hosts of the bacteria of the genus &quot;Epulopiscium&quot; bacteria. These bacteria affect the digestion of surgeonfishes enabling them to digest the algae in their diet.

== In the aquarium ==

Tangs are very sensitive to disease in the home aquarium. However, if the tang is fed enough algae and the aquarium is properly maintained disease should not be a problem. It is usually necessary to quarantine the animals for a period before introducing them to the aquarium.

Adults range from in length and most grow quickly even in aquaria. When considering a tang for an aquarium it is important to consider the size to which these fish can grow. Larger species such as the popular Pacific blue tang surgeonfish (of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; fame), &quot;Naso&quot; or lipstick tang, lined surgeonfish, Sohal surgeonfish and Atlantic blue tang surgeonfish can grow to and require swimming room and hiding places.

Many also suggest adding aggressive tangs to the aquarium last as they are territorial and may fight and possibly kill other fish.

Tangs primarily graze on macroalgae from genera such as &quot;Caulerpa&quot; and &quot;Gracilaria&quot;, although they have been observed in an aquarium setting to eat meat-based fish foods. A popular technique for aquarists, is to grow macroalgae in a sump or refugium. This technique not only is economically beneficial, but serves to promote enhanced water quality through nitrate absorption. The growth of the algae can then be controlled by feeding it to the tang.

<doc id="313075" wikidata="Q2914650" url="?curid=313075" title="Identity politics">
<text>Identity politics is politics based on a particular identity, such as ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, denomination, gender, sexual orientation, social background, caste, age, disability, intelligence, and social class. The term encompasses various often-populist political phenomena and rhetoric, such as governmental migration policies that regulate mobility and opportunity based on identities, left-wing agendas involving intersectional politics or class reductionism, and right-wing nationalist agendas of exclusion of national or ethnic &quot;others.&quot; 

The term &quot;identity politics&quot; dates to the late twentieth century, although it had precursors in the writings of individuals such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Frantz Fanon. Many contemporary advocates of identity politics take an intersectional perspective, which they argue accounts for a range of interacting systems of oppression that may affect a person&#x27;s life and originate from their various identities. To these advocates, identity politics helps center the experiences of those they view as facing systemic oppression so that society can better understand the interplay of different forms of demographic-based oppression and ensure that no one group is disproportionately affected by political actions. Contemporary identity labels—such as people of specific race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, economic class, disability status, education, religion, language, profession, political party, veteran status, recovery status, or geographic location—are not mutually exclusive but are, in many cases, compounded into one when describing hyper-specific groups. An example is that of African-American homosexual women, who can constitute a particular hyper-specific identity class. 

Criticism of identity politics often comes from either the center-right or the far-left on the political spectrum. Many socialists, anarchists and Marxists have criticized identity politics for its divisive nature, claiming that it forms identities that can undermine their goals of proletariat unity and class struggle. On the other hand, many conservative think tanks and media outlets have criticized identity politics for other reasons, such as that it is inherently collectivist and prejudicial. Center-right critics of identity politics have seen it as particularist, in contrast to the universalism espoused by many liberal politics, or argue that it detracts attention from non-identity based structures of oppression and exploitation. 

A leftist critique of identity politics, such as that of Nancy Fraser, argues that political mobilization based on identitarian affirmation leads to surface redistribution—that is, a redistribution within existing structures and relations of production that does not challenge the status quo. Instead, Fraser argued, identitarian deconstruction, rather than affirmation, is more conducive to leftist goals of economic redistribution. Similarly, Marxist academics such as Kurzwelly, Pérez and Spiegel, writing for Dialectical Anthropology, argue that because the term &quot;identity politics&quot; is defined differently based on a given author&#x27;s or activist&#x27;s ideological position, it is analytically imprecise. The same authors argue in another article that identity politics often leads to reproduction and reification of essentialist notions of identity, which they view as inherently erroneous.

== Terminology ==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traces the phrase &quot;identity politics&quot; to 1973.

Mark Mazower writes of the late 20th century: &quot;In general, political activism increasingly revolved ... around issues of &#x27;identity.&#x27; At some point in the 1970s this term was borrowed from social psychology and applied with abandon to societies, nations and groups.&quot;

During the late 1970s, increasing numbers of women—namely Jewish women, women of color, and lesbians—criticized the assumption of a common &quot;woman&#x27;s experience&quot; irrespective of unique differences in race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and culture. The term &quot;identity politics&quot; was (re-)coined by the Combahee River Collective in 1977. The collective group of women saw identity politics as an analysis that introduced opportunity for Black women to be actively involved in politics, while simultaneously acting as a tool to authenticate Black women&#x27;s personal experiences. In the ensuing decades, the term has been employed in myriad cases with different connotations dependent on context. It subsequently gained currency with the emergence of social activism, manifesting in various dialogues within the feminist, American civil-rights, and LGBT movements, as well as within multiple nationalist and postcolonial organizations.

In academic usage, the term &quot;identity politics&quot; refers to a wide range of political activities and theoretical analyses rooted in experiences of injustice shared by different, often excluded social groups. In this context, identity politics aims to reclaim greater self-determination and political freedom for marginalized peoples through understanding particular paradigms and lifestyle factors, and challenging externally-imposed characterizations and limitations, instead of organizing solely around &quot;status quo&quot; belief-systems or traditional party-affiliations. &quot;Identity&quot; is used &quot;as a tool to frame political claims, promote political ideologies, or stimulate and orient social and political action, usually in a larger context of inequality or injustice and with the aim of asserting group distinctiveness and belonging and gaining power and recognition.&quot;

== History ==
The term &quot;identity politics&quot; may have been used in political discourse since at least the 1970s. The first known written appearance of the term is found in the April 1977 statement of the Black feminist socialist group, Combahee River Collective, which was originally printed in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism&quot;, later in &quot;Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology,&quot; edited by Barbara Smith, a founding member of the Collective, who have been credited with coining the term. In their terminal statement, they said:
Identity politics, as a mode of categorizing, are closely connected to the ascription that some social groups are oppressed (such as women, ethnic minorities, and sexual minorities); that is, the idea that individuals belonging to those groups are, by virtue of their identity, more vulnerable to forms of oppression such as cultural imperialism, violence, exploitation of labour, marginalization, or subjugation. Therefore, these lines of social difference can be seen as ways to gain empowerment or avenues through which to work towards a more equal society. In the United States, identity politics is usually ascribed to these oppressed minority groups who are fighting discrimination. In Canada and Spain, identity politics has been used to describe separatist movements; in Africa, Asia, and eastern Europe, it has described violent nationalist and ethnic conflicts. Overall, in Europe, identity politics are exclusionary and based on the idea that the silent majority needs to be protected from globalization and immigration.

During the 1980s, the politics of identity became very prominent and it was also linked to a new wave of social movement activism. Social movements have a significant influence on the law through statutory and constitutional evolution according to William Eskridge.

== Examples ==
=== Racial and ethnocultural ===
Ethnic, religious and racial identity politics dominated American politics in the 19th century, during the Second Party System (1830s–1850s) as well as the Third Party System (1850s–1890s). Racial identity has been the central theme in Southern politics since slavery was abolished.

Similar patterns which have appeared in the 21st century are commonly referenced in popular culture, and are increasingly analyzed in media and social commentary as an interconnected part of politics and society. Both a majority and minority group phenomenon, racial identity politics can develop as a reaction to the historical legacy of race-based oppression of a people as well as a general group identity issue, as &quot;racial identity politics utilizes racial consciousness or the group&#x27;s collective memory and experiences as the essential framework for interpreting the actions and interests of all other social groups.&quot;

Carol M. Swain has argued that non-white ethnic pride and an &quot;emphasis on racial identity politics&quot; is fomenting the rise of white nationalism. Anthropologist Michael Messner has suggested that the Million Man March was an example of racial identity politics in the United States.

==== Arab identity politics ====
Arab identity politics concerns the form of identity-based politics which is derived from the racial or ethnocultural consciousness of the Arabs. In the regionalism of the Arab world and the Middle East, it has a particular meaning in relation to the national and cultural identities of the citizens of non-Arab countries, such as Turkey and Iran. In their 2010 &quot;Being Arab: Arabism and the Politics of Recognition&quot;, academics Christopher Wise and Paul James challenged the view that, in the post-Afghanistan and Iraq invasion era, Arab identity-driven politics were ending. Refuting the view that had &quot;drawn many analysts to conclude that the era of Arab identity politics has passed&quot;, Wise and James examined its development as a viable alternative to Islamic fundamentalism in the Arab world.

According to Marc Lynch, the post-Arab Spring era has seen increasing Arab identity politics, which is &quot;marked by state-state rivalries as well as state-society conflicts&quot;. Lynch believes this is creating a new Arab Cold War, no longer characterized by Sunni-Shia sectarian divides but by a reemergent Arab identity in the region. Najla Said has explored her lifelong experience with Arab identity politics in her book &quot;Looking for Palestine&quot;.

==== Asian-American identity politics ====
In the political realm of the United States, according to Jane Junn and Natalie Masuoka, the possibilities which exist for an Asian American vote are built upon the assumption that those Americans who are broadly categorized as Asians share a sense of racial identity, and this group consciousness has political consequences. However, the belief in the existence of a monolithic Asian American bloc has been challenged because populations are diverse in terms of national origin and language—no one group is predominant—and scholars suggest that these many diverse groups favor groups which share their distinctive national origin over any belief in the existence of a pan-ethnic racial identity. According to the 2000 Census, more than six national origin groups are classified collectively as Asian American, and these include: Chinese (23%), Filipino (18%), Asian Indian (17%), Vietnamese (11%), Korean (11%), and Japanese (8%), along with an &quot;other Asian&quot; category (12%). In addition, the definitions which are applied to racial categories in the United States are uniquely American constructs that Asian American immigrants may not adhere to upon entry to the United States.

Junn and Masuoka find that in comparison to blacks, the Asian American identity is more latent, and racial group consciousness is more susceptible to the surrounding context.

==== Black and Black feminist identity politics ====
Black feminist identity politics are the identity-based politics derived from the lived experiences of struggles and oppression faced by Black women.

In 1977, the Combahee River Collective (CRC) argued that Black women struggled with facing their oppression due to the sexism present within the Civil Rights Movement and the racism present within second-wave feminism. The CRC coined the term &quot;identity politics&quot;, and in their opinion, naming the unique struggle and oppression Black women faced, aided Black women in the U.S. within radical movements and at large. The term &quot;identity politics&quot;, in the opinion of those within the CRC, gave Black women a tool, from which they could use to confront the oppression they were facing. The CRC also claimed to expand upon the prior feminist adage that &quot;the personal is political,&quot; pointing to their own consciousness-raising sessions, centering of Black speech, and communal sharing of experiences of oppression as practices that expanded the phrase&#x27;s scope. As mentioned earlier K. Crenshaw, claimed that the oppression of Black women is illustrated in two different directions: race and sex.

In 1988, Deborah K. King coined the term multiple jeopardy, theory that expands on how factors of oppression are all interconnected. King suggested that the identities of gender, class, and race each have an individual prejudicial connotation, which has an incremental effect on the inequity of which one experiences.

In 1991, Nancie Caraway explained from a white feminist perspective that the politics of Black women had to be comprehended by broader feminist movements in the understanding that the different forms of oppression that Black women face (via race and gender) are interconnected, presenting a compound of oppression (Intersectionality).

A contemporary example of Black identity politics is #BlackLivesMatter which began with a hashtag. In 2013, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi created the hashtag in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who killed Trayvon Martin in 2012.  Michael Brown and Eric Garner were killed by police in 2014, which propelled the #BlackLivesMatter movement forward, first nationally, and then globally. The intention of #BlackLivesMatter was to create more widespread awareness of the way law enforcement engages with the black community and individuals, including claims of excessive force and issues with accountability within law enforcement agencies. The hashtag and proceeding movement garnered a lot of attention from all sides of the political sphere. A counter movement formed the hashtag, #AllLivesMatter, in response to #BlackLivesMatter.

==== White identity politics ====
In 1998, political scientists Jeffrey Kaplan and Leonard Weinberg predicted that, by the late 20th-century, a &quot;Euro-American radical right&quot; would promote a trans-national white identity politics, which would invoke populist grievance narratives and encourage hostility against non-white peoples and multiculturalism. In the United States, mainstream news has identified Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency as a signal of increasing and widespread utilization of white identity politics within the Republican Party and political landscape. Journalists Michael Scherer and David Smith have reported on its development since the mid-2010s.

Ron Brownstein believed that President Trump uses &quot;White Identity Politics&quot; to bolster his base and that this would ultimately limit his ability to reach out to non-White American voters for the 2020 United States presidential election. A four-year Reuters and Ipsos analysis concurred that &quot;Trump&#x27;s brand of white identity politics may be less effective in the 2020 election campaign.&quot; Alternatively, examining the same poll, David Smith has written that &quot;Trump’s embrace of white identity politics may work to his advantage&quot; in 2020. During the Democratic primaries, presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg publicly warned that the president and his administration were using white identity politics, which he said was the most divisive form of identity politics. Columnist Reihan Salam writes that he is not convinced that Trump uses &quot;white identity politics&quot; given the fact that he still has significant support from liberal and moderate Republicans—who are more favorable toward immigration and the legalization of undocumented immigrants—but believes that it could become a bigger issue as whites become a minority and assert their rights like other minority groups. Salam also states that an increase in &quot;white identity&quot; politics is far from certain given the very high rates of intermarriage and the historical example of the once Anglo-Protestant cultural majority embracing a more inclusive white cultural majority which included Jews, Italians, Poles, Arabs, and Irish.[&quot; – &quot;]

A contemporary example of &quot;White identity politics&quot; is the right-wing group Proud Boys. Proud Boys was formed by Gavin McInnes in 2016. Members are males who identify as right-wing conservatives. They take part in political protests with the most infamous being January 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol, which became violent and led to the arrest of their leader, Henry &quot;Enrique&quot; Tarrio and many others. Proud Boys identify as supporters of Donald Trump for President and are outspoken supporters of Americans having unfettered access to firearms by way of the 2nd amendment of the US constitution, having expressed the belief that gun law reform is a “sinister authoritarian plot” to disarm law abiding citizens. According to an article published by Southern Poverty Law Group, Proud Boys members are regularly affiliated with white nationalist extremists and are known for sharing white nationalist content across social media platforms.

Another contemporary example is the hashtag movement #AllLivesMatter. #AllLivesMatter began as a counter narrative to #BlackLivesMatter. People who identify with this countermovement use this hashtag to represent what they call “anti-identity” identity politics, which is supposed to symbolize a movement against racial identities, but they&#x27;ve been criticized as being a white nationalist movement. Created, adopted and circulated beginning in 2016, #WhiteLivesMatter exalted themselves as an anti-racist movement, while identifying #BlackLivesMatter as the opposite.

Columnist Ross Douthat has argued that white identity politics have been important to American politics since the Richard Nixon-era of the Republican Party. Historian Nell Irvin Painter has analyzed Eric Kaufmann&#x27;s thesis that the phenomenon of white identity politics is caused by immigration-derived racial diversity, which reduces the white majority, and an &quot;anti-majority adversary culture&quot;. Writing in &quot;Vox&quot;, political commentator Ezra Klein believes that demographic change has fueled the emergence of white identity politics.

Viet Thanh Nguyen says that &quot;to have no identity at all is the privilege of whiteness, which is the identity that pretends not to have an identity, that denies how it is tied to capitalism, to race, and to war&quot;.

==== Hispanic/Latino identity politics ====
According to Leonie Huddy, Lilliana Mason, and S. Nechama Horwitz, the majority of Latinos in the United States identity with the Democratic Party. Latinos&#x27; Democratic proclivities can be explained by: ideological policy preferences and an expressive identity based on the defense of Latino identity and status, with a strong support for the latter explanation hinged on an analysis of the 2012 Latino Immigrant National Election Study and American National Election Study focused on Latino immigrants and citizens respectively. When perceiving pervasive discrimination against Latinos and animosity from the Republican party, a strong partisanship preference further intensified, and in return, increased Latino political campaign engagement.

==== Indian politics ====

In India, caste, religion, tribe, ethnicity play a role in electoral politics, government jobs and affirmative actions, development projects.

==== Māori identity politics ====
Due to somewhat competing tribe-based versus pan-Māori concepts, there is both an internal and external utilization of Māori identity politics in New Zealand. Projected outwards, Māori identity politics has been a disrupting force in the politics of New Zealand and post-colonial conceptions of nationhood. Its development has also been explored as causing parallel ethnic identity developments in non-Māori populations. Academic Alison Jones, in her co-written &quot;Tuai: A Traveller in Two Worlds&quot;, suggests that a form of Māori identity politics, directly oppositional to Pākehā (white New Zealanders), has helped provide a &quot;basis for internal collaboration and a politics of strength&quot;.

A 2009, Ministry of Social Development journal identified Māori identity politics, and societal reactions to it, as the most prominent factor behind significant changes in self-identification from the 2006 New Zealand census.

==== Muslim identity politics ====

Since the 1970s, the interaction of religion and politics has been associated with the rise of Islamist movements in the Middle East. Salwa Ismail posits that the Muslim identity is related to social dimensions such as gender, class, and lifestyles (Intersectionality), thus, different Muslims occupy different social positions in relation to the processes of globalization. Not all uniformly engage in the construction of Muslim identity, and they do not all apply to a monolithic Muslim identity.

The construction of British Muslim identity politics is marked with Islamophobia; Jonathan Brit suggests that political hostility toward the Muslim &quot;other&quot; and the reification of an overarching identity that obscures and denies cross-cutting collective identities or existential individuality are charges made against an assertive Muslim identity politics in Britain. In addition, because Muslim identity politics is seen as internally/externally divisive and therefore counterproductive, as well as the result of manipulation by religious conservatives and local/national politicians, the progressive policies of the anti-racist left have been outflanked. Brit sees the segmentation that divided British Muslims amongst themselves and with the anti-racist alliance in Britain as a consequence of patriarchal, conservative mosque-centered leadership.

A &quot;Le Monde&quot;/IFOP poll in January 2011 conducted in France and Germany found that a majority felt Muslims are &quot;scattered improperly&quot;; an analyst for &quot;IFOP&quot; said the results indicated something &quot;beyond linking immigration with security or immigration with unemployment, to linking Islam with a threat to identity&quot;.

=== Gender ===
Gender identity politics is an approach that views politics, both in practice and as an academic discipline, as having a gendered nature and that gender is an identity that influences how people think. Politics has become increasingly gender political as formal structures and informal &#x27;rules of the game&#x27; have become gendered. How institutions affect men and women differently are starting to be analysed in more depth as gender will affect institutional innovation.

A key element of studying electoral behavior in all democracies is political partisanship. In 1996, Eric Plutzer and John F. Zipp examined the election of 1992 election, also commonly referred to as &quot;Year of the Woman&quot;, where a then-record- breaking fourteen women ran for governor or U.S. senator, four of whom were successfully elected into office. In analyzing the possibility that male and female voters react differently to the opportunity to cast a vote for a woman, the study provided lent support to the idea that women tend to vote for women and men tend to vote against them. For example, among Republican voters in California, Barbara Boxer ran 10 points behind Bill Clinton among men and about even among women, while Dianne Feinstein ran about 6 points among men but 11 points ahead among women. This gender effect was further amplified for Democratic female candidates who were rated as feminist. These results demonstrate that gender identity has and can function as a cue for voting behavior.

==== Women&#x27;s identity politics in the United States ====
Scholars of social movements and democratic theorists disagree on whether identity politics weaken women&#x27;s social movements and undermine their influence on public policy or have reverse effects. S. Laurel Weldon argues that when marginalized groups organize around an intersectional social location, knowledge about the social group is generated, feelings of affiliation between group members are strengthened, and the movement&#x27;s agenda becomes more representative. Specifically for the United States, Weldon suggests that organizing women by race strengthens these movements and improves government responsiveness to both violence against women of color and women in general.

===LGBT===
By the early-1960s, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in the United States were forming more visible communities, and this was reflected in the political strategies of American homophile groups. Frank Kameny, an American astronomer and gay rights activist, had co-founded the Mattachine Society of Washington in 1961. While the society did not take much political activism to the streets at first, Kameny and several members attended the 1963 March on Washington, where having seen the methods used by Black civil rights activists, they then applied them to the homophile movement. Kameny had also been inspired by the black power movements slogan &quot;Black is Beautiful&quot;, coining his own term &quot;Gay is Good&quot;.

The gay liberation movement of the late-1960s urged lesbians and gay men to engage in radical direct action, and to counter societal shame with gay pride. In the feminist spirit of the personal being political, the most basic form of activism was an emphasis on coming out to family, friends and colleagues, and living life as an openly lesbian or gay person.

By the mid-1970s, an &quot;ethnic model of identity&quot; had surpassed the popularity of both the homophile movement and gay liberation. Proponents operated through a sexual minority framework and advocated either reformism or separatism (notably lesbian separatism).

While the 1970s were the peak of &quot;gay liberation&quot; in New York City and other urban areas in the United States, &quot;gay liberation&quot; was the term still used instead of &quot;gay pride&quot; in more oppressive areas into the mid-1980s, with some organizations opting for the more inclusive &quot;lesbian and gay liberation&quot;. Women and transgender activists had lobbied for more inclusive names from the beginning of the movement, but the initialism LGBT, or &quot;queer&quot; as a counterculture shorthand for LGBT, did not gain much acceptance as an umbrella term until much later in the 1980s, and in some areas not until the &#x27;90s or even &#x27;00s. During this period in the United States, identity politics were largely seen in these communities in the definitions espoused by writers such as self-identified, &quot;black, dyke, feminist, poet, mother&quot; Audre Lorde&#x27;s view, that lived experience matters, defines us, and is the only thing that grants authority to speak on these topics; that, &quot;If I didn&#x27;t define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people&#x27;s fantasies for me and eaten alive.&quot;

==Debates and criticism==
The term &quot;identity politics&quot; has been applied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. discussed identity politics extensively in his 1991 book &quot;The Disuniting of America&quot;. Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of civil rights, argues that a liberal democracy requires a common basis for culture and society to function. Rather than seeing civil society as already fractured along lines of power and powerlessness (according to race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.), Schlesinger suggests that basing politics on group marginalization is itself what fractures the civil polity, and that identity politics therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization. Schlesinger believes that &quot;movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than … perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference.&quot;

Similarly in the United Kingdom, author Owen Jones argues that identity politics often marginalize the working class, saying:

Some supporters of identity politics take stances based on Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak&#x27;s work (namely, &quot;Can the Subaltern Speak?&quot;) and have described some forms of identity politics as strategic essentialism, a form which has sought to work with hegemonic discourses to reform the understanding of &quot;universal&quot; goals. Others point out the erroneous logic and the ultimate dangers of reproducing strong identitarian divisions inherent in essentialism. For queer theorist Paul B. Preciado, &quot;movements for the emancipation of subaltern minorities (racial, gender and sexual, etc.) ended up crystallizing into identity politics. Without having dismantled the regimes of racial, sexual or gender oppression, identity politics have ended up renaturalizing and even intensifying the differences.&quot;

Anies Baswedan, who has been doing identity politics in Indonesia since 2017, referred to it as unavoidable because every candidate competing in a political contest will always have an identity as their nature. During his 2024 Presidential Candidate, he added that identity politics is a form of support and conveying the aspirations of society that should not be met with concern.

=== &quot;Divide and rule&quot; critique ===
Critics argue that groups based on a particular shared identity (e.g. race, or gender identity) can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues, similar to the history of divide and rule strategies.

In response to the formulations of the Combahee River Collective that necessitated the organization of women around intersectional identities to bring about broader social change, socialist and radical feminists insisted that, instead, activism would require support for addressing more &quot;basic&quot; forms of oppression. Other feminists also mirrored this sentiment, implying that a politics of issues should supersede a politics of identity. Tarrow also asserts that identity politics can produce insular, sectarian, and divisive movements incapable of expanding membership, broadening appeals, and negotiating with prospective allies. In other words, separate organization undermines movement identity, distracts activists from important issues, and prevents the creation of a common agenda.

=== Classical liberal critique ===
According to Jonathan Haidt, those who criticize identity politics from the right see it as inherently collectivist and prejudicial, in contradiction to the ideals of classical liberalism.

Jordan Peterson has criticized identity politics and argues that it is practiced on both sides of the political divide: &quot;[t]he left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let&#x27;s say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride&quot;. He considers both equally dangerous, saying that what should be emphasized, instead, is individual focus and personal responsibility.

=== Socialist critique ===
Those who criticize identity politics from the left, such as Marxists and Marxist–Leninists, see identity politics as a version of bourgeois nationalism, i.e. as a divide and conquer strategy by the ruling classes to divide people by nationality, race, ethnicity, religion, etc. so as to distract the working class from uniting for the purpose of class struggle and proletarian revolution.

Sociologist Charles Derber asserts that the American left is &quot;largely an identity-politics party&quot; and that it &quot;offers no broad critique of the political economy of capitalism. It focuses on reforms for blacks and women and so forth. But it doesn&#x27;t offer a contextual analysis within capitalism.&quot; Both he and David North of the Socialist Equality Party posit that these fragmented and isolated identity movements which permeate the left have allowed for a far-right resurgence. Cornel West asserted that discourse on racial, gender and sexual orientation identity was &quot;crucial&quot; and &quot;indispensable&quot;, but emphasized that it &quot;must be connected to a moral integrity and deep political solidarity that hones in on a financialized form of predatory capitalism. A capitalism that is killing the planet, poor people, working people here and abroad.&quot; Historian Gary Gerstle writes that identity politics and multiculturalism thrived in the neoliberal era precisely because these movements did not threaten capital accumulation, and over the same period &quot;pressure on capitalist elites and their supporters to compromise with the working class was vanishing.&quot; The ideological space to oppose capitalism shrank with the fall of communism, forcing the left to &quot;redefine their radicalism in alternative terms&quot;.

Critiques of identity politics have also been expressed by writers such as Eric Hobsbawm, Todd Gitlin, Adolph Reed, Michael Tomasky, Richard Rorty, Michael Parenti, Jodi Dean, Sean Wilentz, Gabriel Rockhill and philosopher Slavoj Žižek. Hobsbawm, as a Marxist, criticized nationalisms and the principle of national self-determination adopted in many countries after 1919, since in his view national governments are often merely an expression of a ruling class or power, and their proliferation was a source of the wars of the 20th century. Hence, Hobsbawm argues that identity politics, such as queer nationalism, Islamism, Cornish nationalism or Ulster loyalism are just other versions of bourgeois nationalism. The view that identity politics (rooted in challenging racism, sexism, and the like) obscures class inequality is widespread in the United States and other Western nations. This framing ignores how class-based politics are identity politics themselves, according to Jeff Sparrow. Marc James Léger has noted that the cross-class alliances that are proposed by identity movements have ideological affinity with not only nationalism but the political right and that moreover, the micro-political emphasis on difference and lifestyle associates identity politics with the petty-bourgeois concerns of the professional-managerial class.

Considering the effectiveness of identity politics for achieving social justice, Kurzwelly raised four main points of critique:[..] an argument for identity politics and strategic essentialism [could be], [f]or example, claims that because racism is real, and that people keep perceiving social race as real (despite scientific rejection of biological races), may justify using racial and other racialising categories to correct social injustices based upon them. Yet, there are several arguments against such a stance: (1) Social essentialism is inherently erroneous so seeking to address social injustices using essentialist thinking perpetuates that error and risks unforeseen consequences (even if motivated by good intentions [...]). (2) Addressing injustices through using essentialist identity categories assumes that people are necessarily underprivileged primarily because of their identity. Even if, in specific contexts, experiences of oppression and exploitation statistically correlate with identity, using identity categories is an imprecise and indirect strategy for addressing their exploitation and oppression. Rather than using fixed identity categories as variables for social justice, one could take account of contextual relative positionality, or use processual variables, both of which would be more precise in assessing relative privilege and capability to seek justice and access rights. (3) Seeking to address injustices on the basis of identities sometimes forces people to adopt and perform an unwanted identity, and to comply with normative expectations about its contents. For example, [...] gender-specific legislation in Argentina forced gender-non-conforming persons to choose between seeking justice and expressing their identity. Similarly, a shift from justice based on fixed categories to justice based on processes might offer a solution. (4) Overall, using essentialist identities in struggles for justice and political change—the strategy of identity politics—stands in an uneasy tension with a politics that prioritises redistribution of means of production and seeks sustained change in economic relations [...].

=== Intersectional critique ===
In her journal article &quot;Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color,&quot; Kimberlé Crenshaw treats identity politics as a process that brings people together based on a shared aspect of their identity. Crenshaw applauds identity politics for bringing African Americans (and other non-white people), gays and lesbians, and other oppressed groups together in community and progress. But she critiques it because &quot;it frequently conflates or ignores intragroup differences.&quot; Crenshaw argues that for Black women, at least two aspects of their identity are the subject of oppression: their race and their sex. Thus, although identity politics are useful, we must be aware of the role of intersectionality. Nira Yuval-Davis supports Crenshaw&#x27;s critiques in &quot;Intersectionality and Feminist Politics&quot; and explains that &quot;Identities are individual and collective narratives that answer the question &#x27;who am/are I/we?&quot; 

In &quot;Mapping the Margins&quot;, Crenshaw illustrates her point using the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill controversy. Anita Hill accused US Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment; Thomas would be the second African American judge on the Supreme Court. Crenshaw argues that Hill was then deemed anti-Black in the movement against racism, and although she came forward on the feminist issue of sexual harassment, she was excluded because when considering feminism, it is the narrative of white middle-class women that prevails. Crenshaw concludes that acknowledging intersecting categories when groups unite on the basis of identity politics is better than ignoring categories altogether.

=== Queer critique ===
In postmodernist analyses, labels are a form of regulation, and any activism based on them increases their regulatory power over subordinate groups. Consequently, &quot;identity politics appears to be narrow, political, state-centered activism that fails to adequately address the cultural bases of power.&quot; This view responds to the emergence of queer politics in the late 1980s, exemplified by the group Queer Nation. Scholars have identified queer politics as the opposite of identity politics, aiming to unite diverse marginalized groups and transcend traditional categories.

Writers in the field of queer theory have at times argued that &quot;queer&quot;, despite generations of specific use to describe a &quot;non-heterosexual&quot; sexual orientation, no longer needs to refer to any specific sexual orientation at all; that it is now only about &quot;disrupting the mainstream&quot;, with author David M. Halperin arguing that straight people may now also self-identify as &quot;queer&quot;. However, many LGBT people believe this concept of &quot;queer heterosexuality&quot; is an oxymoron and offensive form of cultural appropriation which not only robs gays and lesbians of their identities, but makes invisible and irrelevant the actual, lived experience of oppression that causes them to be marginalized in the first place. &quot;It desexualizes identity, when the issue is precisely about a sexual identity.&quot;

Criticism of identity politics also appears in contemporary queer activism. The insurrectionary anarchist network Bash Back!, for example, understood identity politics as being fundamentally reformist and based on a fallacy of coherent communities.

== Representation in modern democracies ==
One of the major challenges in providing quality representation within all modern democracies comes from the many different ways in conceptualizing representation. Hanna Fenichel Pitkin, in her seminal study &quot;The Concept of Representation&quot;, identifies four forms: descriptive, substantive, formalistic, and symbolic representation.

=== Formalistic representation ===
Formalistic representation focuses on the formal procedures of institutions and has two dimensions: authorization and accountability. Authorization looks at the means by which a representative obtains their position in office. Accountability centers around the ability of constituents to &quot;punish&quot; representatives for failing to act according to their wishes or the &quot;responsiveness&quot; of the representative to the constituents.

=== Symbolic representation ===
Symbolic representation involves constituents&#x27; perception of their representatives, including the represented&#x27;s feelings of being fairly and effectively represented. Work on symbolic representation by scholars of race and ethnic politics indicate that marginalized group&#x27;s presence cues the legitimacy of both outcomes and procedure. A study by Nancy Scherer and Brett Curry was concerned with the question if racial diversity on the federal bench impact citizens&#x27; views of the U.S. courts. They found that African-Americans had more trust in the legitimacy of the federal courts as the proportion of African-American judges rose.  Another study by Matthew Hayes and Matthew V. Hibbing evaluated that when the level of black representation was below proportional levels, perceptions of fairness and satisfaction decreased (e.g. symbolic representation).

=== Descriptive representation ===
&quot;Descriptive representation&quot; refers to whether officeholders resemble those being represented. It is concerned only with who a representative is, such as their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, etc.

=== Substantive representation ===
Substantive representation is defined as having one&#x27;s policy views expressed by an elected representative, independent of whether the representatives resemble their constituents and their social and demographic identities. There have been studies that examined the substantive benefits of minority groups&#x27;s representation. In a series of experiments by Amanda Clayton, Diana Z. O&#x27;Brien, and Jennifer M. Piscopo, these researchers controlled both the makeup of the decision-making body and the outcome reached. Across all decision outcomes and issue topics, women&#x27;s equal presence legitimized the decision-making process for respondents. Moreover, gender balance helped improve perceptions of substantive legitimacy when the decision-making body reached an anti-feminist decision. This effect was more pronounced among men, who tend to hold less certain views on women&#x27;s rights

<text>The Tennessean (known until 1972 as The Nashville Tennessean) is a daily newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee. Its circulation area covers 39 counties in Middle Tennessee and eight counties in southern Kentucky. It is owned by Gannett, which also owns several smaller community newspapers in Middle Tennessee, including &quot;The Dickson Herald&quot;, the &quot;Gallatin News-Examiner&quot;, the &quot;Hendersonville Star-News&quot;, the &quot;Fairview Observer&quot;, and the &quot;Ashland City Times&quot;. Its circulation area overlaps those of the &quot;Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Daily News Journal&quot; in Murfreesboro, two other independent Gannett papers. The company publishes several specialty publications, including &quot;Nashville Lifestyles&quot; magazine.

==History==
&quot;The Tennessean&quot;, Nashville&#x27;s daily newspaper, traces its roots back to the &quot;Nashville Whig&quot;, a weekly paper that began publication on September 1, 1812. The paper underwent various mergers and acquisitions throughout the 19th century, emerging as the &quot;Nashville American&quot;.

The first issue of the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot; was printed on Sunday May 12, 1907. The paper was founded by Col. Luke Lea, a 28-year-old attorney and local political activist.

In 1910, the publishers purchased a controlling interest in the &quot;Nashville American&quot;. They began publishing an edition known as &quot;The Tennessean American&quot;. When the &quot;American&quot; formally folded in 1911, some of its employees banded together to found the &quot;Nashville Democrat&quot;. This paper was purchased by the &quot;Tennessean&quot; in 1913.

In 1931, Col. Luke Lea and his son Luke Lea, Jr. were indicted for their role in the failure of the Central Bank and Trust Co. of Asheville, North Carolina. On March 3, 1933, the newspaper was placed under federal receivership, and Ashland City attorney and former &quot;Tennessean&quot; editorial writer Littleton J. Pardue was appointed to direct the paper. Under his leadership circulation grew swiftly, but the newspaper continued to lose money.

In 1935, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation acquired a large portion of the paper&#x27;s outstanding bonds. It eventually sold them to Paul Davis, president of the First American National Bank of Nashville.

Still suffering from effects of the Great Depression, the paper was sold at auction in 1937, when it was purchased for $850,000 by Silliman Evans, Sr. a former reporter for the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;. Evans came to an agreement with &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; publisher James Stahlman to move both newspapers into new offices at 1100 Broadway. He created the Newspaper Printing Corporation as a business agent for both papers. As part of this agreement, the &quot;Tennessean&quot; ceased publication of its evening editions, and the &quot;Banner&quot; ceased publication of its Sunday edition. The two newspapers maintained a joint operating agreement from 1937 until the &quot;Banner&quot; ceased publication February 20, 1998. The two papers operated out of the same building and shared advertising and production staff, but maintained separate (and distinct) ownership and editorial voices.

On June 2, 1955, Silliman Evans Jr. was named president of the paper. After his father died unexpectedly of a heart attack on June 26, the board of the paper elected him publisher, and he became president of the Newspaper Printing Corporation in August.

In 1957, &quot;Tennessean&quot; cartoonist Tom Little won a Pulitzer Prize for his cartoon, &quot;Wonder Why My Parents Didn&#x27;t Give Me Salk Shots?&quot;, encouraging parents to have their children immunized against polio.

In 1961, Silliman Evans Jr. died of a heart attack at age 36 while on his boat on Old Hickory Lake. Ownership of the newspaper passed to his mother, and several months later his brother Amon Carter Evans was named Chief Executive of the paper.

&quot;Tennessean&quot; reporters Nat Caldwell and Gene Graham won a Pulitzer Prize in 1962 &quot;[f]or their exclusive disclosure and six years of detailed reporting, under great difficulties, of the undercover cooperation between management interests in the coal industry and the United Mine Workers.&quot; In the same year, John Seigenthaler Sr. was named editor of the newspaper. He would earn the additional title of publisher in 1973.
In 1972, the Gannett Corporation purchased the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; from the Stahlman family. In 1979, Gannett sold the &quot;Banner&quot; to a group of local investors including political figure John Jay Hooker, businessman Brownlee Currey and Franklin banker Irby Simpkins for about $25 million. It then purchased the &quot;Tennessean&quot; from the Evans family for about $50 million. John Seigenthaler became president, publisher, and editor of the Gannett-owned &quot;Tennessean&quot;. Historian E. Thomas Wood says that &quot;without question&quot; Seigenthaler ran the newspaper as a liberal one.

In 1976, when it was revealed that &quot;Tennessean&quot; reporter Jacqueline Srouji had for many years been working as an informant (and possibly &quot;agent provocateur&quot;) for the FBI, including spying on her colleagues at the paper, Seigenthaler fired her immediately. Srouji claimed that when she had started as a reporter for the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; over a decade before, that paper&#x27;s publisher had encouraged her to hand over information to the FBI.

In 1989, Frank Sutherland was named editor. He had begun his career as a reporter at the paper in 1963. Seigenthaler retired as publisher in 1991. He was replaced by Craig Moon, who held the post until he moved into a corporate position with Gannett in 2002; Moon was later named publisher of &quot;USA Today&quot;. Leslie Giallombardo was publisher from 2002 to 2005. Seigenthaler remained &quot;Chairman Emeritus&quot; until he died.

In September 1998, the paper launched Tennessean.com, its news and information website.

Among the notable journalists who have worked for &quot;The Tennessean&quot; are Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper, Pulitzer Prize winning author David Halberstam, and cartoonist Anthony Wright.

In early 2019, &quot;The Tennessean&quot; confirmed that it would be leaving its long-time headquarters at 1100 Broadway for a smaller facility nearby, and that its printing operations would be consolidated with those of the Gannett-owned &quot;Knoxville News-Sentinel&quot; at a facility near Knoxville, resulting in much earlier deadlines for its print editions.

In March 2013, &quot;The Tennessean&quot;″s circulation was reported as 100,825 daily (M-F), 102,855 (Sat) and 227,626 (Sun). In contrast, as of November 2, 2005, the paper reported daily circulation of 177,714; Saturday circulation of 199,489 and Sunday circulation of 250,575.

The paper&#x27;s primary print competitors are the weekly &quot;Nashville Scene&quot; and the &quot;Nashville Business Journal&quot;. In 2004 Gannett announced the acquisition of the &quot;Franklin Review-Appeal&quot;, and &quot;The Daily News Journal&quot; in Murfreesboro from Morris Multimedia. The &quot;Review-Appeal&quot; became a supplement of &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, while the &quot;Daily News Journal&quot; continued to operate as an independent newspaper.

The paper maintains two Goss Colorliner presses. In 2002, the paper completed installation of a MAN Roland UNISET press, which is now used to print regional editions of &quot;USA Today&quot;, as well as commercial printing jobs. In early 2019 it was announced that the &quot;Tennessean&quot; would begin to be printed in Knoxville on presses which it would share with the &quot;Knoxville News-Sentinel&quot;.

John Seigenthaler joined &quot;The Tennessean&quot; in 1949, resigning in 1960 to act as Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s administrative assistant. He rejoined &quot;The Tennessean&quot; as editor in 1962, publisher in 1973, and chairman in 1982 before retiring as chairman emeritus in 1991.

Ellen Leifeld was named as publisher in September 2005, succeeding Leslie Giallombardo, who became the newspaper&#x27;s first female publisher in April 2002. Carol Hudler was named publisher in 2009 when Leifeld retired. Hudler was replaced by Laura Hollingsworth, who was named president and publisher in May 2013.

Frank Sutherland served as editor of the newspaper from 1989–2004. He began his journalism career as a reporter at the paper in the 1960s and returned as editor after a serving in several leadership positions at other newspapers. He announced his retirement in September 2004. He was briefly succeeded by Everett J. Mitchell II, the former managing editor of the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, who was the first African American to be editor of &quot;The Tennessean&quot;. In September 2006, Mark Silverman was announced as editor. He was replaced by Maria De Varenne in 2011, who held the executive editor post until February 2014. At that time, Stefanie Murray was named vice president for content and engagement. She was previously an assistant managing editor at the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;.

<doc id="313104" wikidata="Q315249" url="?curid=313104" title="Arnolfo di Cambio">
<text>Arnolfo di Cambio ( – 1300/1310) was an Italian architect and sculptor of the Duecento, who began as a lead assistant to Nicola Pisano. He is documented as being &quot;capomaestro&quot; or Head of Works for Florence Cathedral in 1300, and designed the sixth city wall around Florence (1284–1333).

By the end of his career he evidently had one or more workshops of some size, producing work with considerable stylistic variation, and distinguishing his personal hand can be difficult.

==Biography==
Arnolfo&#x27;s biography is complicated by lingering uncertainties as to whether &quot;Arnolfo di Cambio&quot;, born in Colle Val d&#x27;Elsa, Tuscany, and later Master of Works for Florence Cathedral, is the same person as &quot;Arnolfus&quot; who signed the ciboria of San Paolo fuori le Mura and Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome, not to mention &quot;Arnolfus Architectus&quot; who signed the tomb of Pope Boniface VIII. The majority view is that they are the same man, and variations in style are caused by the use of workshop assistants, which many of his large works would certainly have needed. He probably had a workshop in Rome by 1277.

He was Nicola Pisano’s chief assistant on the marble Siena Cathedral Pulpit for the Duomo in Siena Cathedral (1265–1268), but he soon began to work independently on an important tomb sculpture. In 1266–1267 he worked in Rome for King Charles I of Anjou, King of Sicily, portraying him in the famous statue housed in the Campidoglio. He signed the wall tomb of Cardinal Guillaume de Braye (d. 1282) in the church of San Domenico in Orvieto, including an enthroned Madonna (a &quot;Maestà&quot;) for which he took as a model an ancient Roman statue of the goddess Abundantia; the Madonna&#x27;s tiara and jewels reproduce antique models. 

In Rome Arnolfo had seen the Cosmatesque art, and its influence can be seen in the intarsia and polychrome glass decorations in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls and the church Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, where he worked in 1285 and 1293 respectively. In this period he also worked on the presepio of Santa Maria Maggiore, on Santa Maria in Aracoeli, and on the monument of Pope Boniface VIII (1300).

The bronze statue of St. Peter in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is traditionally attributed to him, but this is often doubted. .

In 1294–1295 he worked in Florence, mainly as an architect. According to his biographer Giorgio Vasari, he was in charge of construction of the cathedral of the city, for which he provided the statues once decorating the lower part of the façade destroyed in 1589. The surviving statues are now in the Museum of the Cathedral. While the design of the Church of Santa Croce has been attributed to Arnolfo, this is highly disputed. Vasari also attributed to him the urban plan of the new city of San Giovanni Valdarno.

The monumental character of Arnolfo&#x27;s work has left its mark on the appearance of Florence. His funerary monuments became the model for Gothic funerary art.

Giorgio Vasari included a biography of Arnolfo in his &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;.

Dante Alighieri probably makes a discrete reference to him with a double citation of the Battle at Colle Val d&#x27;Elsa, birthplace of the great artist, in the year 1269 in the Cantos XI, XIII of Purgatorio. Dante almost certainly met Arnolfo, as architect of the cathedral in Florence, at latest when Dante was prior of Florence in 1300.

==Selected works==
===Architecture===

<text>Pauline Kael (; June 19, 1919 – September 3, 2001) was an American film critic who wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from 1968 to 1991. Known for her &quot;witty, biting, highly opinionated and sharply focused&quot; reviews, Kael often defied the consensus of her contemporaries.

One of the most influential American film critics of her era, she left a lasting impression on the art form. Roger Ebert argued in an obituary that Kael &quot;had a more positive influence on the climate for film in America than any other single person over the last three decades&quot;. Kael, he said, &quot;had no theory, no rules, no guidelines, no objective standards. You couldn&#x27;t apply her &#x27;approach&#x27; to a film. With her it was all personal.&quot; In a blurb for &quot;The Age of Movies&quot;, a collection of her writings for the Library of America, Ebert wrote that &quot;Like George Bernard Shaw, she wrote reviews that will be read for their style, humor and energy long after some of their subjects have been forgotten.&quot;

For American readers, she brought attention to international cinema, and championed New Hollywood directors. Sanford Schwartz writes that, in the 1960s, she &quot;gave a breathing, textured life to the aims and sensibilities of Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini, Satyajit Ray, Akira Kurosawa, François Truffaut, and Michelangelo Antonioni, among other European and Asian directors; and she endowed Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Paul Mazursky, Brian De Palma, and Francis Ford Coppola, among American directors of the following decade, with the same full-bodied presence. [...] Her deepest subject, in the end, isn&#x27;t movies at all—it&#x27;s how to live more intensely.&quot;

==Early life and education ==
Kael was born to Isaac Paul Kael and Judith Kael (née Friedman), Jewish immigrants from Poland, on a chicken farm among other Jewish chicken farmers, in Petaluma, California. Her siblings were Louis (1906), Philip (1909), Annie (1912), and Rose (1913). Her parents lost their farm when Kael was eight, and the family moved to San Francisco, where Kael attended Girls High School. 

She wrote of film critics of her generation: &quot;We were in almost at the beginning, when something new was added to the human experience.&quot; Her parents took her to see silent films, which she would later refer to, writing that D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916) was &quot;the greatest movie ever made&quot; and that Renée Falconetti&#x27;s performance in Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; (1928) was &quot;the finest ever recorded on film&quot;. In 1936 she matriculated at the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied philosophy, literature, and art. She dropped out in 1940. Kael had intended to go to law school, but fell in with a group of artists and moved to New York City with the poet Robert Horan.

Three years later, Kael returned to Berkeley and &quot;led a bohemian life&quot;, writing plays and working in experimental film. In 1948, she and the filmmaker James Broughton had a daughter, Gina James, whom Kael raised alone. Gina had a congenital heart defect through much of her childhood, which Kael could not afford the surgery to correct. To support her daughter and herself, Kael worked a series of menial jobs such as cook and seamstress, along with stints as an advertising copywriter.

== Early career ==
In 1952, Peter D. Martin, the editor of &quot;City Lights&quot;, overheard Kael arguing about films in a coffeeshop with a friend and asked her to review Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Limelight&quot; (1952). Kael dubbed the film &quot;Slimelight&quot; and began publishing film criticism regularly in magazines.

Kael later said of her writing: &quot;I worked to loosen my style—to get away from the term-paper pomposity that we learn at college. I wanted the sentences to breathe, to have the sound of a human voice.&quot; She disparaged the supposed critic&#x27;s ideal of objectivity, calling it &quot;saphead objectivity&quot;, and incorporated aspects of autobiography into her criticism. In a review of Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Shoeshine&quot; (1946) that has been ranked among her most memorable, Kael described seeing the film
Kael broadcast many of her early reviews on Berkeley&#x27;s alternative public radio station KPFA, and in 1955 she married Edward Landberg, the owner of the Berkeley Cinema-Guild and Studio. Their marriage soon ended in divorce, but he agreed to pay for Gina&#x27;s heart surgery, and made Kael the manager of the cinema in 1955, a position she held until 1960. In that role, she programmed the films at the two-screen facility, &quot;unapologetically repeat[ing] her favorites until they also became audience favorites&quot;. She also wrote &quot;pungent&quot; capsule reviews of the films, which her patrons began collecting.

==Going mass-market==
Kael continued to juggle writing with other work until she received an offer to publish a book of her criticism. Published in 1965 as &quot;I Lost It at the Movies,&quot; the collection was a surprise bestseller, selling 150,000 paperback copies. Coinciding with a job at the high-circulation women&#x27;s magazine &quot;McCall&#x27;s,&quot; Kael (as &quot;Newsweek&quot; put it in a 1966 profile) &quot;went mass&quot;.

That same year, Kael wrote a blistering review of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;. After mentioning that some of the press had dubbed it &quot;The Sound of Money&quot;, she called the film&#x27;s message a &quot;sugarcoated lie that people seem to want to eat&quot;. According to legend, this review got her fired from &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;The New York Times&quot; said as much in Kael&#x27;s obituary), but Kael and the magazine&#x27;s editor, Robert Stein, denied this. According to Stein, he fired her &quot;months later, after she kept panning every commercial movie from &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot; to &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;.&quot;

Kael&#x27;s dismissal from &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; led to a stint from 1966 to 1967 at &quot;The New Republic&quot;, whose editors continually altered her writing without her permission. In October 1967, Kael wrote a long essay on &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; that the magazine declined to publish. William Shawn of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; obtained the piece and ran it in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; issue of October 21. Kael&#x27;s rave review was at odds with prevailing opinion, which was that the film was inconsistent in its blending of comedy and violence. According to critic David Thomson, &quot;she was right about a film that had bewildered many other critics.&quot; A few months after the essay ran, Kael quit &quot;The New Republic&quot; &quot;in despair&quot;. In 1968, Shawn asked her to join &quot;The New Yorker&quot; staff; she alternated as film critic every six months with Penelope Gilliatt until 1979, and became the sole critic in 1980 after a year&#x27;s leave of absence working in the film industry.

==&quot;The New Yorker&quot; tenure==
Initially, many considered Kael&#x27;s colloquial, brash writing style an odd fit with the sophisticated and genteel &quot;New Yorker&quot;. Kael remembered &quot;getting a letter from an eminent &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer suggesting that I was trampling through the pages of the magazine with cowboy boots covered with dung&quot;. During her tenure at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, she took advantage of a forum that permitted her to write at length—and with minimal editorial interference—thereby achieving her greatest prominence. By 1968, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called her &quot;one of the country&#x27;s top movie critics&quot;.

In 1970, Kael received a George Polk Award for her work as a critic at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. She continued to publish collections of her writing with suggestive titles such as &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot;, and &quot;Taking It All In&quot;. Her fourth collection, &quot;Deeper into Movies&quot; (1973), won the U.S. National Book Award in the Arts and Letters category. It was the first nonfiction book about film to win a National Book Award.

Kael also wrote philosophical essays on movie-going, the modern Hollywood film industry, and what she saw as the lack of courage on the part of audiences to explore lesser-known, more challenging movies (she rarely used the word &quot;film&quot; because she felt it was too elitist). Among her more popular essays were a damning 1973 review of Norman Mailer&#x27;s semi-fictional &quot;Marilyn: a Biography&quot; (an account of Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s life); an incisive 1975 look at Cary Grant&#x27;s career; and &quot;Raising Kane&quot; (1971), a book-length essay on the authorship of the film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; that was the longest piece of sustained writing she had yet done.

Commissioned as an introduction to the shooting script in &quot;The Citizen Kane Book&quot;, &quot;Raising Kane&quot; was first printed in two consecutive issues of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The essay extended Kael&#x27;s dispute of the auteur theory, arguing that Herman J. Mankiewicz, the screenplay&#x27;s coauthor, was virtually its sole author and the film&#x27;s actual guiding force. Kael further alleged that Orson Welles had schemed to deprive Mankiewicz of screen credit. Welles considered suing Kael for libel. He was defended by critics, scholars and friends, including Peter Bogdanovich, who rebutted Kael&#x27;s claims in a 1972 article that included the revelation that Kael had appropriated the extensive research of a UCLA faculty member without crediting him.

Woody Allen said of Kael: &quot;She has everything that a great critic needs except judgment. And I don&#x27;t mean that facetiously. She has great passion, terrific wit, wonderful writing style, huge knowledge of film history, but too often what she chooses to extol or fails to see is very surprising.&quot;

Kael battled the editors of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; as much as her own critics. She fought with Shawn to review the 1972 pornographic film &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, eventually relenting. According to Kael, after reading her unfavorable review of Terrence Malick&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;Badlands&quot;, Shawn said, &quot;I guess you didn&#x27;t know that Terry is like a son to me.&quot; Kael responded, &quot;Tough shit, Bill&quot;, and her review was printed unchanged. Other than sporadic confrontations with Shawn, Kael said she did most of her work at home, writing.

Upon the release of Kael&#x27;s 1980 collection &quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot;, her &quot;New Yorker&quot; colleague Renata Adler published an 8,000-word review in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; that dismissed the book as &quot;jarringly, piece by piece, line by line, and without interruption, worthless.&quot; Adler argued that Kael&#x27;s post-1960s work contained &quot;nothing certainly of intelligence or sensibility&quot; and faulted her &quot;quirks [and] mannerisms&quot;, including repeated use of &quot;bullying&quot; imperatives and rhetorical questions. The piece quickly became infamous in literary circles, described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;the New York literary Mafia[&#x27;s] bloodiest case of assault and battery in years.&quot; Kael did not respond to it, but Adler&#x27;s review became known as &quot;the most sensational attempt on Kael&#x27;s reputation&quot;.

In 1979, Kael accepted an offer from Warren Beatty to be a consultant to Paramount Pictures, but left the position after only a few months to return to writing criticism.

==Later years==
In the early 1980s, Kael was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which sometimes has a cognitive component. As her condition worsened, she became increasingly depressed about the state of American films, along with feeling that &quot;I had nothing new to say&quot;. In a March 11, 1991, announcement that &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;earth-shattering&quot;, Kael announced her retirement from reviewing films regularly. She said she would still write essays for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;reflections and other pieces of writing about movies&quot;, but over the next 10 years, she published no new work except an introduction to her 1994 compendium &quot;For Keeps&quot;. In the introduction (which was reprinted in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;), Kael wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m frequently asked why I don&#x27;t write my memoirs. I think I have&quot;.

Though she published nothing new, Kael was not averse to giving interviews, occasionally giving her opinion on new films and television shows. In a 1998 interview with &quot;Modern Maturity&quot;, she said she sometimes regretted not being able to review: &quot;A few years ago, when I saw &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot;, I wanted to blow trumpets. Your trumpets are gone once you&#x27;ve quit.&quot; She died at her home in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on September 3, 2001, at the age of 82.

==Style==
Kael was known for mingling high and low culture; per &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Ms. Kael could mingle references to literary lions like Saul Bellow, Jean Genet and Norman Mailer with demotic condemnations like loony, sleazo, junk and bummer.&quot; She often made allusions to other arts; reviewing &quot;Jules and Jim&quot;, she writes &quot;The film was adapted from Henri-Pierre Roché&#x27;s autobiographical novel, written when he was seventy-four .. If some of us have heard of Roché, it is probably just the scrap of information that he was the man who introduced Gertrude Stein to Picasso—but this scrap shouldn&#x27;t be discarded, because both Stein and Picasso are relevant to the characters and period of &quot;Jules and Jim&quot;. Roché is now dead, but the model for Catherine, the Jeanne Moreau role, is a German literary woman who is still alive; it was she who translated &quot;Lolita&quot; into German.&quot; She writes that the two title characters are &quot;Mutt and Jeff, Sancho Panza and Don Quixote, devoted friends, contentedly arguing about life and letters.&quot; 

Richard Corliss contrasts Kael with Andrew Sarris: &quot;Sarris’ prose was dense, balanced, aphoristic, alliterative; he had taken more from the French than just the &quot;politique des auteurs&quot;. Kael’s was loping, derisive, intimate, gag-packed, as American as Lenny Bruce. I can recall reading one of Kael’s early pieces in Film Quarterly (1961, maybe) and being shocked—shocked!—to see she’d used a contraction. In those prim days, when most serious film criticism read like term papers in sociology and most popular reviews read like wire copy, Kael’s writing was the battle cry of a vital and dangerous new era, the equivalent of Little Richard’s primal &#x27;A wop bop a loo bop, a wop bam boom!&#x27; that announced the birth of rock ‘n’ roll.&quot;

==Opinions==
Kael&#x27;s opinions often ran contrary to her fellow critics&#x27;. Occasionally, she championed films considered critical failures, such as &quot;The Warriors&quot; and &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. She was not especially cruel to some films that many critics deplored—such as the 1972 &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (she praised Sophia Loren&#x27;s performance). She panned some films that had widespread critical admiration, such as &quot;Network&quot;, &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; (&quot;murky, ragmop&quot;), &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;, most experimental cinema (calling it &quot;a creature of publicity and mutual congratulations on artistry&quot;), most student films (&quot;freshmen compositions&quot;), &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Shoah&quot; (&quot;logy and exhausting&quot;), &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (&quot;a nature boy movie&quot;), and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (&quot;monumentally unimaginative&quot;). Her opinions&#x27; originality and the forceful way she expressed them won her ardent supporters and angry detractors.

Kael&#x27;s reviews included a pan of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) that drew harsh replies from its fans; ecstatic reviews of &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;MASH&quot; that enormously boosted their popularity; and enthusiastic appraisals of Brian De Palma&#x27;s early films. Her &quot;preview&quot; of Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;Nashville&quot; appeared in print several months before the film was completed, in an attempt to prevent the studio from recutting the film and to catapult it to box-office success.

Kael was an opponent of the auteur theory, criticizing it both in her reviews and in interviews. She preferred to analyze films without thinking about the director&#x27;s other works. Andrew Sarris, a key proponent of the theory, debated it with Kael in the pages of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and various film magazines. Kael argued that a film should be considered a collaborative effort. In &quot;Raising Kane&quot;, she argues that &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; relies extensively on the distinctive talents of Mankiewicz and cinematographer Gregg Toland.

===Views on violence===
Kael had a taste for antihero films that violate taboos involving sex and violence; this reportedly alienated some of her readers. But she panned &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), the X-rated antihero film that won an Oscar for Best Picture. She also strongly disliked films she felt were manipulative or appealed in superficial ways to conventional attitudes and feelings. She was particularly critical of Clint Eastwood: her reviews of his films and acting were resoundingly unfavorable, and she became known as his nemesis.

Kael was an enthusiastic, if occasionally ambivalent, supporter of Sam Peckinpah and Walter Hill&#x27;s early work, both of whom specialized in violent action dramas. Her collection &quot;5001 Nights at the Movies&quot; includes favorable reviews of nearly all of Peckinpah&#x27;s films except &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972), as well as Hill&#x27;s &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1975), &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1979), and &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; (1981). Despite her initial dismissal of John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1967) for what she felt was its pointless brutality, she later called it &quot;intermittently dazzling&quot; with &quot;more energy and invention than Boorman seems to know what to do with ... one comes out exhilarated but bewildered&quot;.

But Kael reacted badly to some action films she felt pushed what she called &quot;right-wing&quot; or &quot;fascist&quot; agendas. She called Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971), starring Eastwood, a &quot;right-wing fantasy&quot;, &quot;a remarkably single-minded attack on liberal values&quot;, and &quot;fascist medievalism&quot;. In an otherwise extremely favorable review of Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, Kael concluded that Peckinpah had made &quot;the first American film that is a fascist work of art&quot;.

In her review of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), Kael wrote that she felt some directors who used brutal imagery were desensitizing audiences to violence:
===Accusations of homophobia===
In his preface to a 1983 interview with Kael for the gay magazine &quot;Mandate&quot;, Sam Staggs wrote: &quot;she has always carried on a love/hate affair with her gay legions. ... like the bitchiest queen in gay mythology, she has a sharp remark about everything&quot;. But in the early 1980s, largely in response to her review of the 1981 drama &quot;Rich and Famous,&quot; Kael faced notable accusations of homophobia. First remarked upon by Stuart Byron in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, according to gay writer Craig Seligman, the accusations eventually &quot;took on a life of their own and did real damage to her reputation&quot;.

In her review, Kael called the straight-themed &quot;Rich and Famous&quot; &quot;more like a homosexual fantasy&quot;, saying that one female character&#x27;s &quot;affairs, with their masochistic overtones, are creepy, because they don&#x27;t seem like what a woman would get into&quot;. Byron, who &quot;hit the ceiling&quot; after reading the review, was joined by &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot; author Vito Russo, who argued that Kael equated promiscuity with homosexuality, &quot;as though straight women have never been promiscuous or been given the permission to be promiscuous&quot;.

In response to her review of &quot;Rich and Famous&quot;, several critics reappraised Kael&#x27;s earlier reviews of gay-themed films, including a wisecrack Kael made about the gay-themed &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;: &quot;I always thought this was why lesbians needed sympathy—that there isn&#x27;t much they &quot;can&quot; do.&quot; Seligman has defended Kael, saying that these remarks showed &quot;enough ease with the topic to be able to crack jokes—in a dark period when other reviewers ... &#x27;felt that if homosexuality were not a crime it would spread. Kael rejected the accusations as &quot;craziness&quot;, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t see how anybody who took the trouble to check out what I&#x27;ve actually written about movies with homosexual elements in them could believe that stuff.&quot;

===Nixon quote===
In December 1972, a month after U.S. President Richard Nixon was reelected in a landslide, Kael gave a lecture at the Modern Language Association during which she said: &quot;I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for Nixon. Where they [Nixon&#x27;s other supporters] are I don&#x27;t know. They&#x27;re outside my ken. But sometimes when I&#x27;m in a theater I can feel them.&quot; A &quot;New York Times&quot; article about the lecture quoted this.

Kael was subsequently misquoted as having said, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe Nixon won. I don&#x27;t know anyone who voted for him&quot; or something that similarly expressed surprise at the election result. This misquotation became an urban legend, and has been cited by conservatives (such as Bernard Goldberg, in his 2001 book &quot;Bias&quot;) as an example of insularity among the liberal elite. The misquotation has also been attributed to other writers, such as Joan Didion.

==Influence==
Owen Gleiberman said Kael &quot;was more than a great critic. She reinvented the form, and pioneered an entire aesthetic of writing.&quot; As soon as she began writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Kael greatly influenced her fellow critics. In the early 1970s, Cinerama distributors &quot;initiate[d] a policy of individual screenings for each critic because her remarks [during the film] were affecting her fellow critics&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s, Kael cultivated friendships with a group of young, mostly male critics, some of whom emulated her distinctive writing style. Referred to derisively as the &quot;Paulettes&quot;, they dominated national film criticism in the 1990s. Critics who have acknowledged Kael&#x27;s influence include, among many others, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, David Denby and Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, David Edelstein of &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, Greil Marcus, Elvis Mitchell, Michael Sragow, Armond White, and Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot;. It was repeatedly alleged that, after her retirement, Kael&#x27;s &quot;most ardent devotees deliberate[d] with each other [to] forge a common School of Pauline position&quot; before their reviews were written. When confronted by the rumor that she ran &quot;a conspiratorial network of young critics&quot;, Kael said she believed that critics imitated her style rather than her opinions, saying, &quot;A number of critics take phrases and attitudes from me, and those takings stick out—they&#x27;re not integral to the writer&#x27;s temperament or approach&quot;.

Asked in 1998 whether she thought her criticism had affected the way films were made, Kael deflected the question, saying, &quot;If I say yes, I&#x27;m an egotist, and if I say no, I&#x27;ve wasted my life&quot;. Several directors&#x27; careers were profoundly affected by her, most notably that of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; screenwriter Paul Schrader, who was accepted at UCLA Film School&#x27;s graduate program on Kael&#x27;s recommendation. Under her mentorship, Schrader worked as a film critic before taking up screenwriting and directing full time. Derek Malcolm, who worked for several decades as a film critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said: &quot;If a director was praised by Kael, he or she was generally allowed to work, since the money-men knew there would be similar approbation across a wide field of publications&quot;. Alternately, Kael was said to have had the power to prevent filmmakers from working; David Lean said that her criticism of his work &quot;kept him from making a movie for 14 years&quot; (referring to the 14-year break between &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 1970 and &quot;A Passage to India&quot; in 1984).

In 1978, Kael received the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women in the entertainment industry. In his 1988 film &quot;Willow&quot;, George Lucas named one of the villains &quot;General Kael&quot; after her. Kael had often reviewed Lucas&#x27;s work unenthusiastically; in her review of &quot;Willow&quot;, she called the character an &quot;hommage à moi&quot;.

Though he began directing films after she retired, Quentin Tarantino was also influenced by Kael. He read her criticism voraciously while growing up and said that Kael was &quot;as influential as any director was in helping me develop my aesthetic&quot;. Wes Anderson recounted his efforts to screen his film &quot;Rushmore&quot; for Kael in a 1999 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article titled &quot;My Private Screening With Pauline Kael&quot;. He later wrote to Kael, saying: &quot;[Y]our thoughts and writing about the movies [have] been a very important source of inspiration for me and my movies, and I hope you don&#x27;t regret that&quot;. In 1997, cultural critic Camille Paglia said Kael was her second-favorite critic (behind Parker Tyler), criticizing Kael&#x27;s commentary on such films as &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; and &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; but also calling her &quot;unfailingly perceptive [...] [her] tart, lively, colloquial style I thought exactly right for a mass form like the movies.&quot;

In January 2000, filmmaker Michael Moore posted a recollection of Kael&#x27;s response to his 1989 documentary film &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;. Moore wrote that Kael was incensed that she had to watch &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; in a cinema after Moore refused to send her a tape for her to watch at home, and she resented &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; winning Best Documentary at the 55th New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Moore said:two weeks later, she wrote a nasty, mean review of my film in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. It was OK with me that she didn&#x27;t like the film, and it didn&#x27;t bother me that she didn&#x27;t like the point I was making, or even how I was making it. What was so incredibly appalling and shocking is how she printed outright lies about my movie. I had never experienced such a brazen, bald-faced barrage of disinformation. She tried to rewrite history... Her complete fabrication of the facts was so weird, so out there, so obviously made-up, that my first response was this must be a humor piece she had written... But, of course, she wasn&#x27;t writing comedy. She was a deadly serious historical revisionist.Kael&#x27;s career is discussed at length in the 2009 documentary &quot;For the Love of Movies&quot; by critics whose careers she helped shape, such as Owen Gleiberman and Elvis Mitchell, as well as by those who fought with her, such as Andrew Sarris. The film also shows several of Kael&#x27;s appearances on PBS, including one alongside Woody Allen. In 2011, Brian Kellow published a biography of Kael, &quot;A Life in the Dark&quot;.

In a 2024 interview, director Ridley Scott said that Kael&#x27;s harsh critique of his 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; made him question the value of such reviews, and that he never read reviews of his films after that.

The Pauline Kael Breakout Award for outstanding contribution to cinema is awarded annually by the Florida Film Critics Circle.

Rob Garver&#x27;s documentary &quot;What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael&quot; was released in 2018. With Sarah Jessica Parker narrating for Kael, the film is a portrait of Kael&#x27;s work and her influence on the male-dominated worlds of cinema and film criticism.
David Thomson writes: &quot;How good was she? Very, very good, because she was a terrific journalist who took immense pains to seem spontaneous, who believed that it ought to be possible to write about entertainments in ways that made them more stimulating for thousands of people ... she established for a while something that had not been true since the impact of television — that the movies were ours, that they spoke to and for a society and were the most telling, deeply felt impression of who we were and might be ... as time passes, I suspect she will seem more remarkable, more useful as a measure of her time, and more sexy. I suspect she would have given it all up if she could have had one scene in one film—like Dorothy Malone with Bogart in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;.

<text>The Hopewell tradition, also called the Hopewell culture and Hopewellian exchange, describes a network of precontact Native American cultures that flourished in settlements along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern Eastern Woodlands from 100 BCE to 500 CE, in the Middle Woodland period. The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society but a widely dispersed set of populations connected by a common network of trade routes.

At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the northern shores of Lake Ontario south to the Crystal River Indian Mounds in modern-day Florida. Within this area, societies exchanged goods and ideas, with the highest amount of activity along waterways, which were the main transportation routes. Peoples within the Hopewell exchange system received materials from all over the territory of what now comprises the mainland United States. Most of the items traded were exotic materials; they were delivered to peoples living in the major trading and manufacturing areas. These people converted raw materials into products and exported them through local and regional exchange networks. Hopewell communities traded finished goods, such as steatite platform pipes, far and wide; they have been found among grave goods in many burials outside the Midwest.

==Origins==
Although the origins of the Hopewell are still under discussion, the Hopewell culture can also be considered a cultural climax. 
 Hopewell populations originated in western New York and moved south into Ohio, where they built upon the local Adena mortuary tradition. Or, Hopewell was said to have originated in western Illinois and spread by diffusion... to southern Ohio. Similarly, the Havana Hopewell tradition was thought to have spread up the Illinois River and into southwestern Michigan, spawning Goodall Hopewell. (Dancey 114)

American archaeologist Warren K. Moorehead popularized the term &quot;Hopewell&quot; after his 1891 and 1892 explorations of the Hopewell Mound Group in Ross County, Ohio. The mound group was named after Mordecai Hopewell, whose family then owned the property where the earthworks are sited. What any of the various peoples now classified as Hopewellian called themselves is unknown; indeed, what language families they spoke is unknown. Archaeologists applied the term &quot;Hopewell&quot; to a broad range of cultures. Many of the Hopewell communities were temporary settlements of one to three households near rivers. They practiced a mixture of hunting, gathering, and horticulture.

==Politics and hierarchy==
The Hopewell inherited from their Adena forebears an incipient social stratification. This increased social stability and reinforced sedentism, specialized use of resources, and probably population growth. Hopewell societies cremated most of their deceased and reserved burial for only the most important people. In some sites, hunters apparently were given a higher status in the community: their graves were more elaborate and contained more status goods.

The Hopewellian peoples had leaders, but they did not command the kind of centralized power to order armies of slaves or soldiers. These cultures likely accorded certain families a special place of privilege. Some scholars suggest that these societies were marked by the emergence of &quot;big-men&quot;, leaders whose influence depended on their skill at persuasion in important matters such as trade and religion. They also perhaps augmented their influence by cultivating reciprocal obligations with other important community members. The emergence of &quot;big-men&quot; was a step toward the development of these societies into highly structured and stratified chiefdoms.

The Hopewell settlements were linked by extensive and complex trading routes; these operated also as communication networks, and were a means to bring people together for important ceremonies.

==Mounds==

Today, the best-surviving features of the Hopewell tradition era are earthwork mounds. Researchers have speculated about their purposes and debate continues. Great geometric earthworks are one of the most impressive Native American monuments throughout American prehistory, and were built by cultures following the Hopewell. Eastern Woodlands mounds typically have various geometric shapes and rise to impressive heights. Some of the gigantic sculpted earthworks, described as effigy mounds, were constructed in the shape of animals, birds, or writhing serpents. 

Several scientists, including Bradley T. Lepper, hypothesize that the Octagon, in the Newark Earthworks at Newark, Ohio, was a lunar observatory. He believes that it is oriented to the 18.6-year cycle of minimum and maximum lunar risings and settings on the local horizon. The Octagon covers more than , the size of 100 football pitches. John Eddy completed an unpublished survey in 1978, and proposed a lunar major alignment for the Octagon. Ray Hively and Robert Horn of Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, were the first researchers to analyze numerous lunar sightlines at the Newark Earthworks (1982) and the High Banks Works (1984) in Chillicothe, Ohio.

Christopher Turner noted that the Fairground Circle in Newark, Ohio aligns to the sunrise on May 4, i.e. that it marks the May cross-quarter sunrise. In 1983, Turner demonstrated that the Hopeton earthworks encode various sunrise and moonrise patterns, including the winter and summer solstices, the equinoxes, the cross-quarter days, the lunar maximum events, and the lunar minimum events, due to their precise straight and parallel lines.

William F. Romain has written a book on the subject of &quot;astronomers, geometers, and magicians&quot; at the earthworks.

Many of the mounds also contain various types of human burials, some containing precious grave goods such as ornaments of copper, mica and obsidian imported from hundreds of miles away. Stone and ceramics were also fashioned into intricate shapes.

==Artwork==
The Hopewell created some of the finest craftwork and artwork of the Americas. Most of their works had some religious significance, and their graves were filled with necklaces, ornate carvings made from bone or wood, decorated ceremonial pottery, ear plugs, and pendants. Some graves were lined with woven mats, mica (a mineral consisting of thin glassy sheets), or stones. The Hopewell produced artwork in a greater variety and with more exotic materials than their predecessors the Adena. Grizzly bear teeth, fresh water pearls, sea shells, sharks&#x27; teeth, copper, and small quantities of silver were crafted as elegant pieces. The Hopewell artisans were expert carvers of pipestone, and many of the mortuary mounds are full of exquisitely carved statues and pipes.

Excavation of the Mound of Pipes at Mound City found more than 200 stone smoking pipes; these depicted animals and birds in well-realized three-dimensional form. More than 130 such artifacts were excavated from the Tremper site in Scioto County. Some artwork was made from carved human bones. A rare mask found at Mound City was created using a human skull as a face plate. 
Hopewell artists created both abstract and realistic portrayals of the human form. One tubular pipe is so accurate in form that the model was identified by researchers as an achondroplastic (chondrodystropic) dwarf. Many other figurines are highly detailed in dress, ornamentation, and hairstyles. An example of the abstract human forms is the &quot;Mica Hand&quot; from the Hopewell Site in Ross County, Ohio. Delicately cut from a piece of mica , the hand carving was likely worn or carried for public viewing. They also made beaded work.

==Local expressions of Hopewellian traditions==
In addition to the noted Ohio Hopewell, a number of other Middle Woodland period cultures are known to have been involved in the Hopewell tradition and participated in the Hopewell exchange network.

===Armstrong culture===
The Armstrong culture was a Hopewell group in the Big Sandy River Valley of northeastern Kentucky and western West Virginia from 1 to 500 CE. They are thought to have been a regional variant of the Hopewell tradition or a Hopewell-influenced Middle Woodland group who had peacefully mingled with the local Adena peoples. Archaeologist Edward McMichael characterized them as an intrusive Hopewell-like trade culture or a vanguard of Hopewellian tradition that had probably peacefully absorbed the local Adena in the Kanawha River Valley. Their culture and very Late Adena (46PU2) is thought to have slowly evolved into the later Buck Garden people.

===Copena culture===
The Copena culture was a Hopewellian culture in northern Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, as well as in other sections of the surrounding region including Kentucky. Researchers developed the Copena name based on the first three letters of copper and the last three letters of the mineral galena, as copper and galena artifacts have often been found with Copena burials.

===Crab Orchard culture===

During the Middle Woodland period, the Crab Orchard culture population increased from a dispersed and sparsely settled Early Woodland pattern to one consisting of small and large base camps. These were concentrated on terrace and floodplain landforms associated with the Ohio River channel in southern Indiana, southern Illinois, and northwestern and western Kentucky. In the far western limits of Crab Orchard culture is the O&#x27;byams Fort site. This large earthwork, shaped like a tuning fork, is reminiscent of Ohio Hopewell enclosures. Examples of a type of pottery decoration found at the Mann site are also known from Hopewell sites in Ohio (such as Seip earthworks, Rockhold, Harness, and Turner), as well as from Southeastern sites with Hopewellian assemblages, such as the Miner&#x27;s Creek site, Leake Mounds, 9HY98, and Mandeville site in Georgia, and the Yearwood site in southern Tennessee.

===Goodall focus===
The Goodall focus culture occupied Michigan and northern Indiana from around 200 BCE to 500 CE. The Goodall pattern stretched from the southern tip of Lake Michigan, east across northern Indiana, to the Ohio border, then northward, covering central Michigan, almost reaching to Saginaw Bay on the east and Grand Traverse Bay to the north. The culture is named for the Goodall site in northwest Indiana.

===Havana Hopewell culture===
The Havana Hopewell culture was a Hopewellian people in the Illinois and Mississippi river valleys in Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri. They are considered ancestral to the groups who eventually formed the Mississippian culture that built Cahokia (in present-day southwestern Illinois) and influenced the hinterlands of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, including into the Appalachian Mountains. 

The Toolesboro site is a group of seven burial mounds on a bluff overlooking the Iowa River near its confluence with the Mississippi River. The conical mounds were constructed between 100 BCE and 200 CE. At one time, as many as 12 mounds may have existed. Mound 2, the largest remaining, measures in diameter and in height. This mound was possibly the largest Hopewell mound in Iowa.

===Kansas City Hopewell===
At the western edge of the Hopewell interaction sphere is the Kansas City Hopewell. The Renner Village archeological site in Riverside, Missouri, is one of several sites near the junction of Line Creek and the Missouri River. The site contains Hopewell and succeeding Middle Mississippian remains. The Trowbridge archeological site near Kansas City is close to the western limit of the Hopewell. &quot;Hopewell-style&quot; pottery and stone tools, typical of the Illinois and Ohio River valleys, are abundant at the Trowbridge site. Decorated Hopewell-style pottery rarely appears further west.

The Cloverdale site is situated at the mouth of a small valley that opens into the Missouri River Valley, near present-day Saint Joseph, Missouri. It is a multi-component site with evidence of Kansas City Hopewell (around 100 to 500 CE) and Steed-Kisker (around 1200 CE) occupation.

===Laurel complex===

The Laurel complex was a Native American culture in what is now southern Quebec, southern and northwestern Ontario, and east-central Manitoba in Canada; and northern Michigan, northwestern Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota in the United States. They were the first pottery-using people of Ontario north of the Trent-Severn Waterway. The complex is named after the former unincorporated community of Laurel, Minnesota.

===Marksville culture===
The Marksville culture was a Hopewellian culture in the Lower Mississippi valley, Yazoo valley, and Tensas valley areas of present-day Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Arkansas. It evolved into the Baytown culture and later the Coles Creek and Plum Bayou cultures. It is named for the Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site in Marksville, Louisiana.

===Miller culture===

The Miller culture was a Hopewellian culture located in the upper Tombigbee River drainage areas of southwestern Tennessee, northeastern Mississippi, and west-central Alabama, best known from excavations at the Pinson Mounds, Bynum Mounds, Miller (type site), and Pharr Mounds sites. The culture is divided chronologically into two phases, Miller 1 and Miller 2, with a later Miller 3 belonging to the Late Woodland period. Some sites associated with the Miller culture, such as Ingomar Mound and Pinson Mounds on its western periphery, built large platform mounds. Archaeologist speculate the mounds were for feasting rituals. With that purpose, they fundamentally differed from later Mississippian culture platform mounds, which were mortuary and substructure platforms. By the end of the Late Woodland period, about 1000CE, the Miller culture area was absorbed into the succeeding Mississippian culture.

===Montane Hopewell===
The Montane Hopewell on the Tygart Valley area, an upper branch of the Monongahela River of northern West Virginia, is similar to Armstrong. The pottery and cultural characteristics are also similar to late Ohio Hopewell. They occurred during the neighboring Watson through Buck Garden periods of peoples to the south and westerly in the state. Montane Hopewell is a variant that is a considerable distance from Cole Culture and Peters Phase, or Hopewell central Ohio. According to McMichael, the culture built small, conical mounds in the late Hopewell period; this religion appeared to be waning in terms of being expressed in the daily living activities at these sites. The influence of an elite priest cult, burial phase was centered toward the Midwest states and was less important here.

===Ohio Hopewell culture===

The greatest concentration of Hopewell ceremonial sites is in the Scioto River Valley (from Columbus to Portsmouth, Ohio) and adjacent Paint Creek valley, centered on Chillicothe, Ohio. These cultural centers typically contained a burial mound and a geometric earthwork complex that covers ten to hundreds of acres, with sparse residential settlements. There is little evidence of large resident populations at the monument complexes.

The Hopewell Culture National Historical Park, encompassing mounds for which the culture is named, is in the Paint Creek Valley just a few miles from Chillicothe, Ohio. Other earthworks in the Chillicothe area include Hopeton, Mound City, Seip Earthworks and Dill Mounds District, High Banks Works, Liberty, Cedar-Bank Works, Anderson, Frankfort, Dunlap, Spruce Hill, Story Mound, and Shriver Circle. When colonial settlers first crossed the Appalachians, after almost a century and a half in North America, they were astounded at these monumental constructions, some of which were as high as 70 feet and covering acres.

The Portsmouth Earthworks were constructed from 100 BCE to 500 CE. It is a large ceremonial center located at the confluence of the Scioto and Ohio rivers. Part of this earthwork complex extends across the Ohio River into Kentucky. The earthworks included a northern section consisting of a number of circular enclosures, two large, horseshoe-shaped enclosures, and three sets of parallel-walled roads leading away from this location. One set of walls went to the southwest and may have linked to a large square enclosure located on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River. Another set of walls led to the southeast, where it crossed the Ohio River and continued to the Biggs site, a complicated circular enclosure surrounding a conical mound. The third set of walls went to the northwest for an undetermined distance, in the direction of the Tremper site.

===Point Peninsula complex===
The Point Peninsula complex was a Native American culture located in present-day Ontario, Canada and New York, United States, during the Middle Woodland period. It is thought to have been influenced by the Hopewell traditions of the Ohio River valley. This influence seems to have ended about 250 CE, after which burial ceremonialism was no longer practiced.

===Saugeen complex===
The Saugeen complex was a Native American culture located around the southeast shores of Lake Huron and the Bruce Peninsula, around the London, Ontario area, and possibly as far east as the Grand River in Canada. Some evidence exists that the Saugeen complex people of the Bruce Peninsula may have evolved into the historic Odawa people, also known as the Ottawa.

===Swift Creek culture===
The Swift Creek culture was a Middle Woodland period archaeological culture in the southeast of the United States (present-day Georgia, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee) dating to around 100–700 CE.

===Wilhelm culture===
The Wilhelm culture (1 to 500 CE), Hopewellian influenced, appeared in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia. They were contemporaneous to Armstrong central in the Big Sandy valley, nearly 200 miles downstream on the Ohio River. They were surrounded by peoples who made Watson-styled pottery, with a Z-twist cordage finished surface. Wilhelm pottery was similar to Armstrong pottery, but not as well made. Pipe fragments appear to be the platform-base type.

Small earthwork mounds were built around individual burials in stone-lined graves (cists). These were covered over together under a single large mound.

Little studied are their four reported village sites, which appear to have been abandoned by about 500 CE. As of 2009, new local researchers are looking at this area period and may provide future insight.

==Cultural decline==
Around 500 CE, the Hopewell exchange ceased, mound building stopped, and characteristic art forms were no longer produced. War is a possible cause, as villages dating to the Late Woodland period shifted to larger communities protected by palisade walls and ditches. Colder climatic conditions could have driven game animals north or west in search of grazing land. The introduction of the bow and arrow may have led to over-hunting of game populations, as well as making warfare more deadly. With fewer people using trade routes, the transmission of traditions may have dwindled away. The breakdown in social organization could also have resulted from adoption of full-scale agriculture. Conclusive reasons for the evident dispersal of the people have not yet been determined.

<text>A night-vision device (NVD), also known as a night optical/observation device (NOD) or night-vision goggle (NVG), is an optoelectronic device that allows visualization of images in low levels of light, improving the user&#x27;s night vision. 

The device enhances ambient visible light and converts near-infrared light into visible light which can then be seen by humans; this is known as I2 (image intensification). By comparison, viewing of infrared thermal radiation is referred to as thermal imaging and operates in a different section of the infrared spectrum. 

A night vision device usually consists of an image intensifier tube, a protective housing, and an optional mounting system. Many NVDs also include a protective sacrificial lens, mounted over the front/objective lens to prevent damage by environmental hazards, while some incorporate telescopic lenses. An NVD image is typically monochrome green, as green was considered to be the easiest color to see for prolonged periods in the dark. Night vision devices may be passive, relying solely on ambient light, or may be active, using an IR (infrared) illuminator. 

Night vision devices may be handheld or attach to helmets. When used with firearms, an IR laser sight is often mounted to the weapon. The laser sight produces an infrared beam that is visible only through an NVD and aids with aiming. Some night vision devices are made to be mounted to firearms. These can be used in conjunction with weapon sights or standalone; some thermal weapon sights have been designed to provide similar capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;nv/therm clipon sights&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These devices were first used for night combat in World War II and came into wide use during the Vietnam War. The technology has evolved since then, involving &quot;generations&quot; of night-vision equipment with performance increases and price reductions. Consequently, though they are commonly used by military and law enforcement agencies, night vision devices are available to civilian users for applications including aviation, driving, and demining.

==History==
In 1929 Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi invented an infrared-sensitive electronic television camera for anti-aircraft defense in the UK. Night vision technology prior to the end of World War II was later described as Generation 0.

Night-vision devices were introduced in the German Army as early as 1939 and were used in World War II. AEG started developing its first devices in 1935. In mid-1943, the German Army began testing infrared night-vision devices and telescopic rangefinders mounted on Panther tanks. Two arrangements were constructed. The Sperber FG 1250 (&quot;Sparrow Hawk&quot;), with a range of up to 600 m, had a 30 cm infrared searchlight and an image converter operated by the tank commander.

From late 1944 to March 1945 the German military conducted successful tests of FG 1250 sets mounted on Panther Ausf. G tanks (and other variants). During the war, approximately 50 (or 63) Panthers were equipped with the FG 1250 and saw combat on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. The &quot;Vampir&quot; man-portable system for infantry was used with StG 44 assault rifles.

Parallel development occurred in the US. The M1 and M3 infrared night-sighting devices, also known as the &quot;sniperscope&quot; or &quot;snooperscope&quot;, saw limited service with the US Army in World War II and in the Korean War, to assist snipers. These were active devices, using an infrared light source to illuminate targets. Their image-intensifier tubes used an anode and an S-1 photocathode, made primarily of silver, cesium, and oxygen, and electrostatic inversion with electron acceleration produced gain.

An experimental Soviet device called the PAU-2 was field-tested in 1942.

In 1938 the British Admiralty assumed responsibility for British military infra-red research. They worked first with Philips until the fall of the Netherlands, then with Philips&#x27; UK subsidiary Radio Transmission Equipment Ltd., and finally with EMI, who in early 1941 provided compact, lightweight image converter tubes. By July 1942 the British had produced a binocular apparatus called &#x27;Design E&#x27;. This was bulky, needing an external power pack generating 7,000 volts, but saw limited use with amphibious vehicles of 79th Armoured Division in the 1945 crossing of the Rhine. Between May and June 1943, 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division trialled man-portable night vision sets, and the British later experimented with mounting the devices to Mark III and Mark II(S) Sten submachine guns. However, by January 1945 the British had only made seven infra-red receiver sets. Although some were sent to India and Australia for trials before the end of 1945, by the Korean War and Malayan Emergency the British were using night vision equipment supplied by the United States.

Early examples include:
* FG 1250 Sperber
* ZG 1229 Vampir 
* PAU-2
* PNV-57A tanker goggles
* SU-49/PAS-5
* T-120 Sniperscope, 1st model (World War II)
* M2 Sniperscope, 2nd model (World War II)
* M3 Sniperscope, 4th model (Korean War)
* AN/PAS-4 (early Vietnam War)

After World War II, Vladimir K. Zworykin developed the first practical commercial night-vision device at Radio Corporation of America, intended for civilian use. Zworykin&#x27;s idea came from a former radio-guided missile. At that time, infrared was commonly called &quot;black light&quot;, a term later restricted to ultraviolet. Zworykin&#x27;s invention was not a success due to its large size and high cost.

=== United States ===

==== Generation 1 ====
First-generation passive devices developed by the US Army in the 1960s were introduced during the Vietnam War. They were an adaptation of earlier active technology and relied on ambient light instead of using an extra infrared light source. Using an S-20 photocathode, their image intensifiers amplified light around -fold, but they were quite bulky and required moonlight to function properly. 

Examples:
* AN/PVS-1 Starlight scope
* AN/PVS-2 Starlight scope
* AN/PAS 6 Varo Metascope

=== Generation 2 ===

1970s second-generation devices featured an improved image-intensifier tube using a micro-channel plate (MCP) with an S-25 photocathode. This produced a much brighter image, especially around the edges of the lens. This led to increased clarity in low ambient-light environments, such as moonless nights. Light amplification was around . Image resolution and reliability improved.

Examples:
* AN/PVS-3 Miniaturized night vision sight
* AN/PVS-4
* AN/PVS-5
* SUPERGEN

Later advances brought GEN II+ devices (equipped with better optics, SUPERGEN tubes, improved resolution and better signal-to-noise ratios), though the label is not formally recognized by the NVESD.

=== Generation 3 ===
Third-generation night-vision systems, developed in the late 1980s, maintained the MCP from Gen II, but used a gallium arsenide photocathode, with improved resolution. GA photocathodes are primarily manufactured by L3Harris Technologies and Elbit Systems of America and imaged light from 500-900 nm. In addition, the MCP was coated with an ion barrier film to increase tube life. However, the ion barrier allowed fewer electrons to pass through. The ion barrier increased the &quot;halo&quot; effect around bright spots or light sources. Light amplification (and power consumption) with these devices improved to around –. 

Examples:
* AN/PVS-7
* AN/NVS-7
* AN/PVS-10
* AN/PVS-14
* AN/PNVS-14
* AN/PVS-17
* CNVS-4949
* PN-21K

=== Auto-gating ===
Autogating (ATG) rapidly switches the power supply&#x27;s voltage to the photocathode on and off. These switches are rapid enough that they are not detectable to the human eye and peak voltage supplied to the night vision device is maintained. This reduces the &quot;duty cycle&quot; (ie. the amount of time that the tube has power running through it) which increases the device&#x27;s lifespan. Autogating also enhances the Bright-Source Protection (BSP), which reduces the voltage supplied to the photocathode in response to ambient light levels. Automatic Brightness Control (ABC) modulates the amount of voltage supplied to the microchannel plate (rather than the photocathode) in response to ambient light. Together, BSP and ABC (alongside autogating) serves to prevent temporary blindness for the user and prevent damage to the tube when the night vision device is exposed to sudden bright sources of light, like a muzzle flash or artificial lighting. These modulation systems also help maintain a steady illumination level in the user&#x27;s view that improves the ability to keep &quot;eyes on target&quot; in spite of temporary light flashes. These functions are especially useful for pilots, soldiers in urban environments, and special operations forces who may be exposed to rapidly changing light levels. 

=== Generation 3+ (GEN III OMNI I–IX) ===
OMNI, or OMNIBUS, refers to a series of contracts through which the US Army purchased GEN III night vision devices. This started with OMNI I, which procured AN/PVS-7A and AN/PVS-7B devices, then continued with OMNI II (1990), OMNI III (1992), OMNI IV (1996), OMNI V (1998), OMNI VI (2002), OMNI VII (2005), OMNI VIII, and OMNI IX. 

However, OMNI is not a specification. The performance of a particular device generally depends upon the tube which is used. For example, a GEN III OMNI III MX-10160A/AVS-6 tube performs similarly to a GEN III OMNI VII MX-10160A/AVS-6 tube, even though the former was manufactured in ~1992 and the latter ~2005.

One particular technology, PINNACLE is a proprietary thin-film microchannel plate technology created by ITT that was included in the OMNI VII contract. The thin-film improves performance.

GEN III OMNI V–IX devices developed in the 2000s and onward can differ from earlier devices in important ways:

* An automatic gated power supply system regulates the photocathode voltage, allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions.
* A removed or greatly thinned ion barrier that decreases the number of electrons that are rejected by GEN III MCP, hence resulting in less image noise. The disadvantage to a thin or removed ion barrier is the overall decrease in tube life from a theoretical mean time to failure (MTTF) for standard Gen III type, to MTTF for thin film types. This loss is largely negated by the low number of image-intensifier tubes that reach of operation before requiring replacement.

The consumer market sometimes classifies such systems as Generation 4, and the United States military describes these systems as Generation 3 autogated tubes (GEN III OMNI V-IX). Moreover, as autogating power supplies can be added to any previous generation of night-vision devices, autogating capability does not automatically put the devices in a particular OMNI classification. Any postnominals appearing after a generation type (i.e., Gen II+, Gen III+) indicate improvement(s) over the original specification&#x27;s requirements.

Examples:
* AN/PVS-22
* NVS-22
* Binocular Night Vision Device (BNVD) (AN/PVS-15, AN/PVS-21, AN/PVS-23, AN/PVS-31A, AN/PVS-31D)
* Ground Panoramic Night Vision Goggle (GPNVG-18)

==Figure of merit==
Figure of merit (FoM) is a quantitative measure of a NVD&#x27;s effectiveness and clarity. It is calculated using the number of line pairs per millimeter that a user can detect multiplied by the image intensifier&#x27;s signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio.

In the late 1990s, innovations in photocathode technology significantly increased the SNR, with new tubes surpassing Gen 3 performance.

By 2001, the United States federal government concluded that a tube&#x27;s generation was not a determinant performance factor, obsoleting the term as a basis of export regulations.

The US government has recognized the fact that the technology itself makes little difference, as long as an operator can see clearly at night. Consequently, the United States bases export regulations directly on the figure of merit.

ITAR regulations specify that US-made tubes with a FOM greater than 1400 are not exportable; however, the Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA) can waive that policy on a case-by-case basis.

== Fusion night vision ==

Fusion night vision combines I² (image intensification) with thermal imaging, which functions in the medium (MWIR 3-5 μm) and/or long (LWIR 8-14 μm) wavelength range. Initial models appeared in the 2000s. Dedicated fusion devices and clip-on imagers that add a thermal overlay to standard I² night vision devices are available. Fusion combines excellent navigation and fine details (I²), with easy heat signature detection (imaging). 

Fusion modes include night vision with thermal overlay, night vision only, thermal only, and others such as outline (which outlines objects that have thermal signatures) or &quot;decamouflage&quot;, which highlights all objects that are of near-human temperature. Fusion devices are heavier and more power hungry than I²-only devices.

One alternative is to use an I² device over one eye and a thermal device over the other eye, relying on the human visual system to provide a binocular combined view.

=== Examples ===
* AN/PSQ-20 ENVG (Enhanced Night Vision Goggles)
* AN/PSQ-36 FGE (Fusion Goggle Enhanced, previously FGS for Fusion Goggle System)
* AN/PSQ-42 ENVG-B (Enhanced Night Vision Goggles-Binocular)
* AN/PSQ-44 ENVG-B (Enhanced Night Vision Goggles-Binocular)
* AN/PAS-29 COTI/E-COTI: (Enhanced) Clip-On Thermal Imager

== Out of band ==
Out of Band (OOB) refers to night vision technologies that operate outside the 500-900 nm NIR (near infrared) frequency range. This is possible with dedicated image intensifier tubes or with clip-on devices. 

=== Advantages ===

* OOB devices might see more on a starlit night because OOB devices intensify any ambient, UV, or SWIR light. 
* OOB devices image 1064nm light, which can help JTACs and other FACs when marking targets with a laser designator, which typically use 1064nm light, which is barely visible to Gen III.
* OOB light is not visible to most commercial devices. Night vision has proliferated among countries such as Russia and China, and into the hands of armed groups such as the Taliban Red Unit. Friendly forces using night vision equipment such as IR illuminators, IR strobes, or IR lasers, can be spotted. OOB tech are much more difficult to spot with Gen III (depending on wavelength and intensity).
* OOB devices that operate in the 1550nm range can perceive typical laser rangefinders.

**Optics 1 CTAM (Coded Target Acquisition Marker) (1064 nm)

== Wide field of view ==
Night vision devices typically have a limited field of view (FoV); the commonly used AN/PVS-14 has a FoV of 40, less than the 95° monocular horizontal FoV and humans&#x27; 190° binocular horizontal FoV. This forces users to turn their heads to compensate. This is particularly evident when flying, driving, or CQB, which involves split second decisions. These limitations led many SF/SOF operators to prefer white light rather than night vision when conducting CQB. As a result, much time and effort has gone into research to develop a wider FoV solution.

=== Panoramic night vision goggles ===
Panoramic night vision goggles (PNVG) increase FoV by increasing the number of sensor tubes. This solution adds size, weight, power requirements, and complexity. An example is GPNVG-18 (Ground Panoramic Night Vision Goggle). These goggles, and the aviation AN/AVS-10 PNVG from which they were derived, offer a 97° FoV.

Examples:

* GPNVG-18
* AN/AVS-10 

=== Foveated night vision ===
Foveated night vision (F-NVG) uses specialized WFoV optics to increase the field of view through an intensifier tube. The fovea refers to the part of the retina which is responsible for central vision. These devices have users look &quot;straight through&quot; the tubes so light passing through the center of the tube falls on the foveal retina, as is the case with traditional binocular NVGs. The increased FoV comes at the price of image quality and edge distortions.
Examples:
*WFoV F-NVG retrofit AN/PVS-15 goggles
*WFoV BNVD (combined F-NVG and DIT-NVG variant of AN/PVS-31A)
=== Diverging image tube ===
Diverging image tube (DIT) night vision increases FoV by angle the tubes slightly outward. This increases peripheral FoV but causes distortion and reduced image quality. With DIT, users are no longer looking through the center of the tubes (which provides the clearest images) and light passing through the center of the tubes no longer falls on the fovea. 

Examples:

* AN/PVS-25 (2000s). 
* WFoV BNVD: variant of the AN/PVS-31A which incorporates both F-NVG and DIT-NVG. The foveal WFoV optics increase the FoV of each tube from 40° to 55°, while the angulation of the tubes positions them so there is a 40° overlap of binocular vision in the center and a total 70° FoV. It offers a FoM of 2706, better than the FoM in either the GPNVG-18 and the standard AN/PVS-31A.
* Noise Fighters Panobridge: binocular bridge mount which combines two AN/PVS-14 monoculars and allows them to be angled. outward or positioned parallel

==Digital==
Some night vision devices, including several of the ENVG (AN/PSQ-20) models, are &quot;digital&quot;. Introduced in the late 2000s, these allow transmission of the image, at the cost of increased size, weight, power usage.

High-sensitivity digital camera technology enables NVGs that combine a camera and a display instead of an image intensifier. These devices can offer Gen-1-equivalent quality at a lower cost. At the higher end, SiOnyx has produced digital color NVGs. The &quot;Opsin&quot; of 2022 has a form factor and helmet weight similar to an AN/PVS-14, but requires a separate battery pack. It offers a shorter battery life and lower sensitivity. It can however tolerate bright light and process a wider range of wavelengths.

== Other technologies ==
Ceramic Optical Ruggedized Engine (CORE) produces higher-performance Gen 1 tubes by replacing the glass plate with a ceramic plate. This plate is produced from specially formulated ceramic and metal alloys. Edge distortion is improved, photo sensitivity is increased, and the resolution can be as high as 60 /mm. CORE is still designated Gen 1 as it does not utilize a microchannel plate.

A night-vision contact lens prototype places a thin strip of graphene between layers of glass that reacts to photons to brighten dark images. Prototypes absorb only 2.3% of light, which is considered not yet enough for practical use by its developers.

The Sensor and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) of the US Army Research Laboratory developed quantum-well infrared detector (QWID). This technology&#x27;s epitaxial layers use a gallium arsenide (GaAs) or aluminum gallium arsenide system (AlGaAs) which are particularly sensitive to mid-length infrared waves. The Corrugated QWID (CQWID) broadens detection capacity by using a resonance superstructure to orient more of the electric field parallel so that it can be absorbed, although cryogenic cooling between 77 K and 85 K is required. QWID technology may be appropriate for continuous surveillance viewing due to its claimed low cost and uniformity in materials but it has yet to enter commercial production.

Materials from the II–VI compounds, such as HgCdTe, are used for high-performance infrared light-sensing cameras. An alternative within the is InAsSb, which is common in opto-electronics such as DVDs and mobile phones. A graded layer with increased atomic spacing and an intermediate layer of GaAs substrate can trap any potential defects.

Metasurface-based upconversion technology provides a night-vision film that weighs less than a gram and can be placed across ordinary glasses. Photons pass through a resonant non-local lithium niobate metasurface with a pump beam. The metasurface boosts the photons&#x27; energy, pushing them into the visible spectrum without converting them to electrons. Cooling is not required and visible and infrared light appear in a single image. Its frequency range is 1550-nm infrared to visible 550-nm light. Because, traditionally, night-vision systems capture side-by-side views from each spectrum, they can&#x27;t produce identical images unlike films applied to ordinary glasses.

==Soviet Union/Russia==


The Soviet Union, and after 1991 the Russian Federation, have developed their own night-vision devices. Models used after 1960 by the Russian/Soviet Army are designated &quot;1PNxx&quot; (xx), where &quot;1PN&quot; is the GRAU index of night-vision devices. The PN stands for &quot;pritsel nochnoy&quot; (), meaning &quot;night sight&quot;, and the &quot;xx&quot; is the model number. Different models introduced around the same time use the same type of batteries and mounting mechanism. Multi-weapon models have replaceable elevation scales, with one scale for the ballistic arc of each. Supported weapons include the AK family, sniper rifles, light machine guns and hand-held grenade launchers.

* 1PN113, a night sight similar to the 1PN110, for the SV-98 sniper rifle.

The Russian army fielded a series of so-called (). The counter-sniper night sight is an active system that uses laser pulses from a laser diode to detect reflections from the focal elements of enemy optical systems and estimate their distance:
* 1PN106 counter-sniper night sight for the SVD sniper rifle and its SVDS variant.
* 1PN119 counter-sniper night sight for the PKMN and Pecheneg light machine guns.
* 1PN120 counter-sniper night sight for the SVDK sniper rifle.
* 1PN121 counter-sniper night sight for the ASVK large caliber sniper rifle.
* 1PN123 counter-sniper night sight for the SV-98 sniper rifle.

==Legal restrictions==
* Belgium: firearms legislation forbids night-vision devices that can be mounted on a firearm.
* Czech Republic: not regulated. Previously only available for hunting.
* Germany: law forbids such devices if their purpose is to be mounted on firearms except for hunting wild boars.
* Iceland: night-vision devices for hunting is prohibited, although owning the devices is permitted.
* India: civilian possession and trading of night-vision scopes is prohibited without permission from Union home ministry.
* Netherlands: possession is not regulated, but night-vision devices mounted on firearms require a permit. Using mounted night-vision equipment for hunting requires a permit in the Veluwe for hunting wild boar.
* New Zealand: rescue helicopter services use US-made Gen3 goggles for use only according to US export regulations. Use of NVD for shooting non-indigenous game animals, such as rabbits, hares, deer, pigs, tahr, chamois, goats, wallabies, is permitted.
* United States: a 2010–2011 summary of state hunting regulations for the use of night-vision equipment in hunting listed 13 states in which the equipment is prohibited, 17 states with various restrictions (e.g. only for certain non-game species, and/or in a certain date range), and 20 states without restrictions. It did not summarize the regulations for thermal-imaging equipment.
** California: possessing a device &quot;designed for or adaptable to use on a firearm which, through the use of a projected infrared light source and electronic telescope, enables the operator thereof to visually determine and locate the presence of objects during the night-time&quot; is a misdemeanor. This essentially covers scopes using Gen0 technology, but not subsequent generations. 
** Minnesota, as of 2014, &quot;A person may not possess night vision or thermal imaging equipment while taking wild animals or while having in possession [an uncased and loaded weapon] that could be used to take wild animals.&quot; Law-enforcement and military use is exempt.

<text>The northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), known colloquially as the common cardinal, red cardinal, or just cardinal, is a bird in the genus &quot;Cardinalis&quot;. It can be found in southeastern Canada, through the eastern United States from Maine to Minnesota to Texas, New Mexico, southern Arizona, southern California and south through Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala. It is also an introduced species in a few locations such as Bermuda and all major islands of Hawaii since its introduction in 1929. Its habitat includes woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and wetlands. It is the state bird of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The northern cardinal is a mid-sized perching songbird with a body length of and a crest on the top of the head. The species expresses sexual dimorphism: Females are a reddish olive color, and have a gray mask around the beak, while males are a vibrant red color, and have a black mask on the face, as well as a larger crest. Juvenile cardinals do not have the distinctive red-orange beak seen in adult birds until they are almost fully mature. On hatching, their beaks are grayish-black and they do not become the trademark orange-red color until they acquire their final adult plumage in the fall. 

The northern cardinal is mainly granivorous but also feeds on insects and fruit. The male behaves territorially, marking out his territory with song. During courtship, the male feeds seed to the female beak-to-beak. The northern cardinal&#x27;s clutch typically contains three to four eggs, with two to four clutches produced each year. It was once prized as a pet, but its sale was banned in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

==Taxonomy==
The northern cardinal was described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. It was originally categorized as &quot;Loxia&quot; &quot;cardinalis&quot;, a genus which now contains only crossbills. In 1838, it was recategorized as &quot;Cardinalis virginianus&quot;. In 1918, the scientific name was sometimes replaced with &quot;Richmondena cardinalis&quot;. In 1983, the scientific name was changed again to &quot;Cardinalis cardinalis&quot; and the common name was changed to &quot;northern cardinal&quot; to avoid confusion with the several other species also termed cardinals.

The cardinal is named after cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, who wear distinctive red robes and caps. The term &quot;northern&quot; in the common name refers to its range, as it is the northernmost cardinal species known.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Northern cardinals are numerous across the eastern United States from the southern half of Maine to Minnesota to the Texas-Mexico border and in Canada in the southern portions of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, all the way east to Cape Breton Island. Its range also extends south through Mexico to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, northern Guatemala, and northern Belize. An allopatric population is found on the Pacific slope of Mexico from Jalisco to Oaxaca &quot;(this population is not shown on the range map)&quot;. The species was introduced to Bermuda in 1700. It has also been introduced in Hawaii. Its natural habitat is in woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and wetlands.

In 1929, Forbush described the species as rare, and by 1955 Griscom reported the bird to be &quot;pushing northward&quot; when recorded annually at feeding stations. Audubon data shows that the population has grown rapidly in Massachusetts since 1960. In Massachusetts, the species is most abundant in the east, especially in areas where dense cover is interspersed with open areas, such as woodland edges, brushy fields, wooded wetlands, parks, and suburban areas. They tend to avoid extensive woodlands.

== Adults ==
The northern cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a body length of and a wingspan of . The adult weighs from , with an average . The male averages slightly larger than the female.

=== Adult plumage ===
The adult male is a brilliant crimson red color with a black face mask over the eyes, extending to the upper chest. The color becomes duller and darker on the back and wings. The female is fawn-colored, with mostly grayish-brown tones and a slight reddish tint on the wings, crest, and tail feathers. The face mask of the female is gray to black and is less defined than that of the male. Both sexes possess prominent raised crests and bright coral-colored beaks. The beak is cone-shaped and strong. Young birds, both male and female, show coloring similar to the adult female until the fall, when they molt and grow adult feathers. They are brown above and red-brown below, with brick-colored crest, forehead, wings, and tail. The legs and feet are a dark pink-brown. The iris of the eye is brown.

The plumage color of the males is produced from carotenoid pigments in the diet. Coloration is produced from both red pigments and yellow carotenoid pigments. Northern cardinal males metabolize carotenoid pigments to create plumage pigmentation of a color different from the ingested pigment. When fed only yellow pigments, males become a pale red color. A few rare &quot;yellow morph&quot; cardinals lack the enzyme to convert carotenoids into red pigments, and have a yellow beak and feathers (except for black face mask).

During winter, cardinals will fluff up their down feathers in order to retain warm air next to their body. The down feathers are small and hairlike at the base of each flight feather. The legs and feet are thin and lack feathers, and are vulnerable to rapid heat loss. In cold temperatures, cardinals will shiver and tense their muscles, especially breast muscles, to generate heat. Cardinals have the ability to drop their body temperature 3 to 6° if needed in order to survive cold temperatures.

=== Songs ===
Both sexes sing clear, whistled song patterns, which are repeated several times, then varied. Some common phrases are described as &quot;cheeeer-a-dote, cheeer-a-dote-dote-dote&quot;, &quot;purdy, purdy, purdy...whoit, whoit, whoit, whoit&quot;, &quot;what-cheer, what-cheer... wheet, wheet, wheet, wheet&quot; and &quot;cheer, cheer, cheer, what, what, what, what&quot;. 

The northern cardinal has a distinctive alarm call, a short metallic &quot;chip&quot; sound. This call often is given when predators approach the nest, in order to give warning to the female and nestlings.

The songs of the two sexes of the northern cardinal, although not distinguishable by the human ear, are sexually dimorphic. It is suggested that this is because of the differences in levels of hormones of the two sexes.
=== Diet ===
The diet of the adult northern cardinal consists mainly (up to 90%) of weed seeds, grains, and fruits. It is a ground feeder and finds food while hopping on the ground through trees or shrubbery. It will also consume snails and insects, including beetles, cicadas, and grasshoppers, and the young are fed almost entirely on insects. Other common items include corn, oats, sunflower seeds, the blossoms and bark of elm trees, and drinks of maple sap from holes made by sapsuckers.

===Territoriality===
The northern cardinal is a territorial song bird. The male sings in a loud, clear whistle from the top of a tree or another high location to defend his territory. He will chase off other males entering his territory. He may mistake his image on various reflective surfaces as an invading male and will fight his reflection relentlessly. The northern cardinal learns its songs, and as a result the songs vary regionally. Mated pairs often travel together. The songs of a northern cardinal will usually overlap more in syllables when compared to other northern cardinals near it than those far away from it. 

=== Reproduction ===
Pairs may mate for successive years, but some also &quot;divorce&quot; between seasons or choose a new mate when one dies. Pairs generally stay together year-round but are not necessarily monogamous. DNA studies of two populations of cardinals found that 9–35% of nestlings were not fathered by the female&#x27;s mate. Mated pairs sometimes sing together before nesting. During courtship they may also participate in a bonding behavior where the male collects food and brings it to the female, feeding her beak-to-beak.

The cardinals&#x27; nest is made of thin twigs, bark strips, and grasses, lined with grasses or other plant fibers. Males sometimes bring nest material to the female, who does most of the building. She crushes twigs with her beak until they are pliable, then turns in the nest to bend the twigs around her body and push them into a cup shape with her feet. The cup has four layers: coarse twigs (and sometimes bits of trash) covered in a leafy mat, then lined with grapevine bark (when available) and finally grasses, stems, rootlets, and pine needles (where available). The nest typically takes three to nine days to build; the finished product is tall, across, with an inner diameter of about . Cardinals do not usually use their nests more than once. The female builds a cup nest in a well-concealed spot in dense shrub or a low tree off the ground. 

The oldest wild cardinal banded by researchers lived at least 15 years and 9 months, although 28.5 years was achieved by a captive bird. Annual survival rates for adult northern cardinals have been estimated at 60–65%.

==Nests==
=== Eggs ===
There are usually three or four eggs per nest, though there are sometimes as few as one or as many as five. The eggs are white, with a tint of green, blue, or brown, and are marked with lavender, gray, or brown blotches which are thicker around the larger end. The shell is smooth and slightly glossy. Eggs measure approximately in size.

Eggs are laid one to six days following the completion of the nest. Three or four eggs are laid in each clutch. The female generally incubates the eggs. The male may incubate for brief periods of time, though this is rare. Incubation takes 12 or 13 days. Young fledge 10 or 11 days after hatching. Two or three, and even four, broods are raised each year. The male cares for and feeds each brood as the female incubates the next clutch of eggs.Cardinals in Massachusetts have been observed to nest in thick and dense shrubs, trees, and vine tangles, making nests out of twigs, grass, and plant fibers. The eggs are usually incubated by female cardinals, who have brood patches, while the male cardinal forages for food.

=== Nestlings ===
Newly hatched cardinals weigh an average of 3–3.5 grams, are naked, blind, and immobile, and do not have feathers until they are 4–5 days old. Unlike adults, their diet is mainly composed of insects, which adults crush with their beaks and feed to them. They gain weight at a rate of about 2–3 grams per day, but grow a bit slower until day 2, faster from day 2 to day 7 or 8, and then slower for the day or two before fledging.

=== Vocalizations ===

Nestlings vocalize to attract parents for feeding. Very young nestlings will beg if the nest is moved, but as they grow older, they start to only respond to their parents&#x27; presence or their songs.

=== Defecation ===
Nestlings defecate in the form of a fecal sac, where the fecal matter is enclosed by a tough mucous membrane. They are produced every 3 or 4 feedings, and female cardinals sometimes stimulate defecation by poking the nestling near the cloaca. Fecal sacs from the first 4- or 5 days of nesting are eaten by the parents, and later sacs are carried away from the nest and dropped.

== Ecology ==
===Predators===
Northern cardinals are preyed upon by a wide variety of predators native to North America, including falcons, all &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks, shrikes, bald eagles, golden eagles and several owls, including long-eared owls, and eastern screech owls. Predators of chicks and eggs include milk snakes, coluber constrictors, blue jays, crows, eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels, eastern chipmunks, and domestic cats.

Cowbirds have been observed to parasitize their nests.

== Relationship with humans ==
The northern cardinal is found in residential areas throughout its range. Bird feeders attract it by using feeders containing seeds, particularly sunflower seeds and safflower seeds. An increase in backyard feeding by humans has increased the range of this species, with an estimated global range of and a global population of some 100 million. Populations appear to remain stable or increasing. 

Cardinals were once prized as pets due to their bright color and distinctive song. In the United States, this species is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which also banned their sale as cage birds. It is illegal to take, kill, or possess northern cardinals, and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is also protected by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada.

A study conducted in 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia, on West Nile virus transmission in the United States found that unlike other species, northern cardinals biologically suppress the disease upon infection.

=== Mascot ===
In the United States, the northern cardinal (referred to as just &quot;cardinal&quot;) is the mascot of numerous athletic teams; however, most teams portray the bird with a yellow beak and legs. In professional sports, it is the mascot of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball&#x27;s National League and the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League, which for many years were also based in St. Louis. In college athletics, it is the mascot of many schools, including Ball State University, The Catholic University of America, Illinois State University, the University of the Incarnate Word, Lamar University, the University of Louisville, the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, North Central College, North Idaho College, Otterbein University, Saint John Fisher College, the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, Wesleyan University, Wheeling University, and William Jewell College.

=== U.S. state bird ===
The northern cardinal is the state bird of seven U.S. states, more than any other species: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia; although in each case the particular state just refers to the bird as &quot;cardinal&quot;. It was also a candidate to become the state bird of Delaware but lost to the Delaware Blue Hen. Because the cardinal is the state bird of the six states along its route, the Amtrak passenger train between Chicago and Washington DC bears the name of the bird as well.

== Subspecies ==
There are 19 subspecies:

<text>The Pisuerga is a river in northern Spain, the Duero&#x27;s second largest tributary. It rises in the Cantabrian Mountains in the province of Palencia, autonomous region of Castile and León.
Its traditional source is called Fuente Cobre, but it has been discovered that the real source is a glacier higher in the mountains. The river flows south into the Douro river shortly after passing through the city of Valladolid. Its length is approximately 270 kilometres (170 mi).

Since the 1950s the water level of the river has been very regular throughout the year due to the huge Aguilar de Campoo dam which collects all the water from the river&#x27;s rainy upper valleys. This regulation has allowed the creation of vast extensions of irrigated farmland along the Pisuerga&#x27;s course across the northern Castilian plain.

==In Spanish culture==
The Spanish phrase (&quot;And now since Pisuerga crosses Valladolid&quot;) is a popular way to point out or acknowledge a non sequitur since the river has no bearing with the following &quot;consequence&quot;.

<doc id="313135" wikidata="Q313110" url="?curid=313135" title="Mahendra of Nepal">
<text>Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev (; 11 June 1920 – 31 January 1972) was King of Nepal from 13 March 1955 until his death in 1972.

He led the 1960 coup d&#x27;état, in which he dismissed the government, jailed other political leaders, suspended the constitution, banned political parties, and established an autocratic royal regime. He ruled the country with his Panchayat system for 28 years until the introduction of multi-party democracy in 1990. During his reign, Nepal experienced a period of industrial, political and economic change which opened it to the rest of the world for the first time, after the 104-year-long reign of the Rana rulers, who kept the country under an isolationist policy, came to an end in 1951.

== Early life ==

Mahendra was born on 11 June 1920 (1977 B.S) at the Narayanhiti Palace to King Tribhuvan of Nepal. He was the eldest child of King Tribhuvan and Queen Kanti. Under the Rana dynasty, the power of the king was reduced to that of a figurehead. Although Tribhuvan was nominally king since 1911, the royal family had been held captive in Narayanhiti Palace since the rise of the prominent Rana dynasty.

Even though he did not have formal education, King Mahendra was privately educated inside the palace and learned politics, economics and Nepali literature, history and culture.

Inside the palace, King Mahendra had a love affair with a concubine, named Geeta Gurung through which a child was born at the age of 13. There was only one child named Rabindra Shah. Since the concubine was not a Thakuri, his marriage could not take place and the royal family decided to marry their son with a match from the Rana family.

In 1940, he married Indra Rajya Lakshmi, the granddaughter of Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana and daughter of General Hari Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. Mahendra had three sons, Birendra, Gyanendra, and Dhirendra and three daughters Shanti, Sharada, and Shobha. His first wife, Crown Princess Indra died in 1950.

In 1951 King Tribhuvan launched a successful political movement against the Ranas and established Nepal as a constitutional monarchy. Mahendra was not happy that King Tribhuvan had reduced the rights of the monarchy in the 1951 (2007 B.S) Interim Constitution while bidding farewell to the Rana dynasty after the 1951 revolution.

After the death of his first wife Indra Rajya in 1950, the then Prince Mahendra was in a love affair with sister-in-law, Ratna, but King Tribhuvan was planning to prevent his son from marrying Rana&#x27;s daughter Ratna under any circumstances. Prince Mahendra did not like the pressure of his father to marry the girl of his choice. King Tribhuvan, on the other hand, was not in favor of expanding relations with the Rana family, even more so with the Shamsher clan. King Tribhuvan was outraged by the insult inflicted on him by Juddha Shamsher, but the dispute had been going on for a long time. In 1952, two years after the death of his queen, Mahendra married Indra&#x27;s younger sister, Ratna Rajya Lakshmi Devi. This created bad relations between him and his father. This marriage produced no children, as King Mahendra had married on the condition his personal life should not hinder his national duties, and the queen agreed to be childless.

==Early reign==

Mahendra became the king of Nepal as the successor of King Tribhuvan. When King Tribhuvan left for Europe for treatment, Mahendra got the authority from the then King Tribhuvan. He inherited the throne aged 34 as a constitutional monarch. He became king on 13 March 1955 but his coronation took place on 2 May 1956 due to the one year mourning period of death of his father.

=== Tanka Prasad Acharya&#x27;s cabinet ===
On 27 January 1956 (Magha 13, 2012 B.S) King Mahendra appointed Acharya as the prime minister of Nepal. The first five-year plan was launched during his tenure as prime minister. During his time, Nepal Rastra Bank and the Supreme Court were established. Acharya&#x27;s tenure is also seen as a golden age for Nepal in foreign relations. In addition to establishing diplomatic relations with many countries, the government was able to establish close ties with the Chinese government. The Chinese government had provided Rs 60 million to Nepal on 7 October 1956 (Ashwin 22, 2013 B.S). Tanka Prasad Acharya resigned as prime minister in July 1957(Ashadha 2014 B.S).

=== Kunwar Indrajit Singh&#x27;s cabinet ===
Kunwar Indrajit Singh was appointed prime minister by King Mahendra in 1957 (2014 B.S) His cabinet included Education Minister Mahakavi Laxmi Prasad Devkota. He tenure was mostly spent in attempts to curtail his own enemies He was later replaced by a government led by Suvarna Samsher Rana. According to General Nara Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana, he was dismissed by King Mahendra because he tried to stage a coup against the king and relegate him to a &#x27;puppet king&#x27;, just like in the Rana days.

===1959 constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal===
King Mahendra had promulgated the constitution in 1959(2015 B.S) to take the country towards a parliamentary system. On the basis of the royal announcement on 1 February 1958, a Constitution Drafting Commission was formed on 27 March 1958, to take the country towards a parliamentary system. On the basis of the draft prepared by the Constitution Drafting Commission, the Constitution of the Dominion of Nepal(2015) was announced on 12 February 1959 (Falgun 1, 2015 B.S) from King Mahendra. Sections 73 and 75 came into force on 12 February 1959, and the rest of the sections came into force from 17 June 1959. In that law, which has a bicameral system, the lower house was the House of Representatives and the upper house was the General Assembly. There was a system of 109 members elected from 109 constituencies in the House of Representatives, while in the General Assembly there were 36 members with 18 elected and 18 nominated. Candidates were required to be 25 years of age to become a candidate for the House of Representatives and 30 years of age to be a candidate for the General Assembly. After reaching the age of 21, one could become a voter. The constitution had made the first provision of Public Service Commission which required one-third member to have not had served government job for last 5 years. The arrangement of the Auditor General was also made for the first time while there was no arrangement for an Election Commission. The constitution recognized Nepali as the official language and Devanagari as the official script of the country. The 1959 election was held in accordance with this constitution 

=== 1959 general election ===
In order to elect 109 representatives to the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of Nepal, the first democratic election of Nepal was held in 45 days from Falgun 7, 2015 until Chaitra 21, 2015. B.S. This election was held in accordance with the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1959, which was implemented on Falgun 1, 2015 B.S. The Nepali Congress, achieved two-third majority and emerged as the largest party in the election.

=== BP Council of Ministers ===
The Nepali Congress, which emerged as the largest party in the election, elected party president B. P. Koirala as the leader of the parliamentary party and fielded him as Nepal&#x27;s prime minister. On Jestha 13, 2016 B.S. Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala of the Nepali Congress took the oath of office before the then King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah. The first assembly of the house took on 1 July 1959 (Ashadha 17, 2016 B.S.)

===1960 coup d&#x27;état===

On 15 December 1960, King Mahendra used his emergency powers and took charge of the State once again claiming that the Congress government had fostered corruption, promoted party above national interest and failed to maintain law and order. The King suspended the constitution, dissolved the elected parliament, dismissed the cabinet, imposed direct rule and imprisoned the then-prime minister B. P. Koirala and his closest government colleagues. Political parties were outlawed.

== Panchayat regime ==
On 13 April 1961, Mahendra made a televised appearance, in which he introduced Panchayat, a partyless political system of village, district and national councils. At first, the Nepali Congress leadership propounded a non-violent struggle against the new order and formed alliances with several political parties, including the Gorkha Parishad and the United Democratic Party. However, the king would abolish political activities, jail political dissenters calling them anti-national elements and introduce a new constitution in which the people could elect their representatives, while real power remained in the hands of the monarch.

=== 1962 constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal ===
The Constitution Drafting Commission was formed on 8 May 1962, with the then Minister for Finance and Economic Affairs Rishikesh Shah as chairman and Kulshekhar Sharma as Member Secretary and Mrs. Angur Baba Joshi as the only female member. The commission was assigned to submit the draft constitution to the king within 23 days until 1 June 1962. On 16 December 1962, King Mahendra promulgated a new constitution institutionalizing a four-tier Panchayat System. The constitution had a unicameral legislature named as Rashtriya Panchayat. Sovereign power and residual rights were vested in the King based on Article 90. There was a provision that the constitution could be amended by a royal proclamation from the king. This constitution made the provision of Election Commission and the Commission for Prevention of Abuse of Authority for the first time. The arrangement of 6 class organizations was made which could send its class representatives in the Rashtriya Panchayat while the basic duties of citizens were also designated. The Constitution officially recognized Hindu religion as the national religion and introduced country&#x27;s first national anthem by giving official recognition to Shriman Gambhir. It also introduced the new modernized national flag of the country and therewith introduced the method to draw out the flag for the first time. In addition to that, it introduced national emblem such as Lali gurans as the national flower, crimson colour as the national colour, the cow as the national animal and Danphe as the national bird of Nepal.

The constitution, which has been amended 3 times, was first amended on 27 January 1967. Through the first amendment, the various English words used in the constitution were replaced with Nepali, Nepal was divided into 14 zones and 75 districts and the arrangement of zonal commissioner was made. The constitution would officially abolish political parties and substitute a &quot;&quot;National Guidance&quot; system&quot; based on local panchayat led directly by the king.

=== 1963 Panchayat election ===
The first elections to the National Panchayat took place in March and April 1963. The panchayat election of 1963 was held on the basis of constitution of kingdom of Nepal 1962. Although political parties officially were banned and the major opposition parties publicly refused to participate, about one-third of the members of the legislative were associated with the Nepali Congress. There were 4,000 village assemblies at the local level, electing nine members of the village assemblies, who in turn elected a mayor. Each village assemblies sent a member to sit on one of seventy-five district &quot;panchayat&quot;, representing from forty to seventy villages; one-third of the members of these assemblies were chosen by the town &quot;panchayat&quot;. Members of the district &quot;panchayat&quot; elected representatives to fourteen zone assemblies functioning as electoral colleges for the National Panchayat in Kathmandu. In addition, there were class organizations at village, district, and zonal levels for peasants, youth, women, elders, laborers, and ex-soldiers, who elected their own representatives to assemblies.

===Panchayat system (1962–1972)===
Adopted on the second anniversary of the royal coup and founded on the idea of having a system &quot;suitable to the soil&quot;, the new constitution, created a four-tier Panchayat System. The National Panchayat of about ninety members could not criticize the royal government, debate the principles of partyless democracy, introduce budgetary bills without royal approval, or enact bills without approval of the king. Mahendra was supreme commander of the armed forces, appointed (and had the power to remove) members of the Supreme Court, appointed the Public Service Commission to oversee the civil service, and could change any judicial decision or amend the constitution at any time. To many of the unlettered citizens of the country, the king was a spiritual force as well, representing the god Vishnu upholding dharma on earth. Within a span of ten years, the king had, in effect, reclaimed the unlimited power exercised by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the eighteenth century.

Support of the king by the army and the government bureaucracy prevented opposition to his rule from developing within the Panchayat System. Real power came from the king&#x27;s secretariat, and in the countryside influence rested in the offices of zonal commissioners and their official staffs or the parallel system of development officers. The Nepali Congress leadership made increasingly conciliatory statements and began to announce its faith in democratic ideals under the leadership of the king. In 1968 the king began to release political prisoners, including B. P. Koirala, who was freed on 30 October. At this point, a three-way split developed in the Nepali Congress. B.P. Koirala went to India, where he headed a wing committed to democratic revolution and violent overthrow of the Panchayat System. He was a symbol for youth but powerless politically. Subarna Shamsher&#x27;s wing continued to advocate local cooperation with the king outside the Panchayat System. A third wing tried to work within the Panchayat System in the expectation that it would evolve into a democratic system. The disunity of the political opposition left King Mahendra to do as he wished.

== Attempts to overthrow the regime ==
There were multiple struggles and attempts to remove the king from power both before and during the Panchayat regime.

=== 1957 coup d&#x27;état attempt ===
King Mahendra used his residual power of Royal prerogative of mercy and pardoned KI Singh in 1955 when he was declared a traitor and rebellion against the state by former state powers. He was then allowed to enter the country and listening to his nationalist view, KI Singh was appointed prime minister by King Mahendra in 1957. He tenure was mostly spent in attempts to curtail his enemies while he also tried to stage a coup against the king with the help of the army. However, the head of the army, General Nar Shamsher, being loyal to the king informed him about the coup and KI Singh was immediately dismissed.

=== Janakpur bomb incident ===
On 22 January 1962, King Mahendra visited the Janaki Mandir temple after completing his eastern tour. Arvind Kumar Thakur and other anti-panchayat youths under the leadership of Durgananda Jha threw a bomb at the car he was traveling in when he was returning to the arena after performing religious visit. Fifty nine people were arrested on the charge of their involvement in the incident and a special court was formed to investigate the incident. The court found three people, Durgananda Jha, Arvind Kumar Thakur and Dal Singh Thapa, guilty on 3 July 1962. They were slapped death penalty on grounds of treason and rebellion on 4 September 1963, after the introduction of new Nation&#x27;s Legal Code (Muluki Ain) on 17 August 1963 since the old law did not allow the punishment of a person of Brahmin descent. On 29 January 1964, Durgananda Jha was hanged until death while Arvind Kumar Thakur and Dal Singh Thapa had their sentenced changed to life time imprisonment.

== Notable works and improvements ==

=== Promotion of nationalism ===

King Mahendra&#x27;s role in the promotion of nationalism has been unforgettable. In nearly two centuries since Prithvi Narayan Shah, Nepal was administered as a single political entity from Kathmandu and was treated as a single country by its neighbouring powers including like China, India and Tibet but its citizens never had a unified sense of &quot;Nepali-ness&quot;. Even the citizens of the country did not know where and what Nepal was. calling Kathmandu valley as Nepal, lower plains around Birgunj, Biratnagar area as Madesh, upper gorkha region as Gorkha, and western Nepal as Khas and even the king as Gorkhali King rather than a king of Nepal. It is said that Nepal was built before, but Nepal as a political boundary and country was institutionalized by King Mahendra. Before 1960, foreigners were free to purchase land in Nepal. After coup d&#x27;état of 1960, King Mahendra banned foreigners from purchasing land in Nepal. At that moment there was no single language used by the whole nation, and Nepalese were increasingly influenced from foreign languages. Indian cultures, Indian cinemas, teaching of Hindi language in the schools were all the signs leading towards the amalgamation of Nepal into India. Mahendra was uncomfortable with the widespread changes happening in the country: a diverse elected cabinet under BP Koirala; political parties in the Terai advocating for an autonomous province; and Hindi, lingua franca of the people of Indian origin, being spoken in Parliament. The king was troubled by how democracy had allowed people to assert their identity and culture forcing communalism, regionalism, and other anti-national motives. When Hindi dominance was increasing in communities, he devised the policy of national language by selecting Khas Kura as the national language as it was the lingua franca and made it nationwide. The language was transformed from lingua franca, to official language and then later to national language. By establishing the Nepal Rastra Bank, King Mahendra made Nepali currency compulsory throughout the kingdom. At that time, 90 percent of Indian currency was in circulation in Nepal. By creating a distinct language, distinct currency, distinct dress, distinct political system and distinct religious identity from those of the neighbouring nations, Mahendra created a distinct identity of the people which in turn promoted national unity and nationality. King Mahendra personally funded 2 lakh 50 thousand rupees to build a martyr&#x27;s gate at Bhadrakali, Kathmandu in order to honor the great martyrs who died for the rights and democracy of the people during the rana regime.

He is also credited for introducing country&#x27;s first national anthem by giving official recognition to Shriman Gambhir. The constitution introduced by King Mahendra in 1962 introduced the modern national flag of the country which is being used until today. In 1955 King Mahendra appointed a commission headed by famous writer Balkrishna Sama to make nominations of National heroes of Nepal since ancient times on the basis of their contributions to the nation.

=== Diplomatic campaign ===

The role played by Mahendra in establishing Nepal in the international arena is important. From the thought of achieving membership of the United Nations to establishing Nepal as a zone of peace major attributions goes to King Mahendra. Adopting the principle of Panchsheel and non-aligned foreign policy, he maintained diplomatic relations with neighboring countries and kept them in balance. King Mahendra established diplomatic relations with 45 countries to show the world that Nepal is an independent nation. Mahendra personally attended the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, FPR Yugoslavia, making Nepal one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement.

In 2012 B.S, Nepal also became a member of the United Nations. Rishikesh Shah then became the Permanent Representative to the United Nations. On Magha 13, 2012 B.S, King Mahendra appointed Acharya as the prime minister of Nepal. He established friendly relations by visiting China and Japan. Under his guidance and policy, Nepal was elected as a Member of United Nations Security Council in 1969. Nepal was elected in the Security Council the second time again in 1988. Nepal established its image as a committed member of the UN and Nepal was well recognized by the member countries. Nepal&#x27;s active role and the role he played on the Security Council twice are the proof of a success policy guided by the King.

King&#x27;s tenure is also seen as a golden age for Nepal in foreign relations. In addition to establishing diplomatic relations with many countries, the government was able to establish close ties with the Chinese government. He pursued a foreign policy of neutrality between China and India. One of the historical diplomatic achievement of king Mahendra is his success in Nepal-China Boundary Treaty of 1961. The border adjustments was made on grounds of equality by performing land-swapping with Nepal gaining more land than it gave. After the treaty Nepal gained 302.75 square kilometer more land from China.

=== Development policy ===

King Mahendra introduced five years government plans to plan and oversee development in the country. Seeing the importance of planning in better development, the king established the National Planning Commission in 2013 BS. For the first time the industrial policy of 1957 formally recognized the responsibility of the government in &quot;promoting, assisting and regulating&quot; industrial development in the country and the First Plan intended to establish state monopolies in the fields of transportation, telecommunication, hydro-electric power generation and irrigation, and to run some big industries, such as cement, sugar, cigarettes, textiles, iron and steel From 1960 to 1965, government&#x27;s population policy was to resettle people from the Hills to the Terai. However, in 1965, King Mahendra formally endorsed a new population policy to bring equilibrium between population and economic growth. The official policy was firstly to reduce population growth through socio-economic change, secondly through family planning program and only then through resettlement. Following the promulgation of Nepal Electricity Corporation Act 2019, Nepal Electricity Corporation (NEC) came into operation in 1962 which was the main authority for responsible for providing electricity to the citizens. The provision of planning for five years known as the five-year plan started during his reign from 1956. He introduced Company Act for the first time in Nepal on 1964 to facilitate and manage the industrialization of the economy. The highway built by the king has greatly contributed to the all round socio-economic development of the country. He launched the Back to the Village National Campaign in 1967 which was one of his largest rural development efforts. He established Nepal Sports Council to oversee the development of the sports activities in the country.

=== Economic reforms ===

Before 1956, Nepal did not have its own foreign currency reserve but rather maintained it in central bank of India. For getting the foreign currency amounts required to bear the expenses of Nepalese Embassies and treatment expenses of King, an application had to be submitted to the Reserve Bank of India. One of the problems that distressed Nepalese economy was the circulation of two types of currency, Nepalese and Indian simultaneously. Nepal had a dominant use of Indian rupee. Exchange rates between the Indian and Nepali currency were fixed by local traders. Between 2007 and 2011 B.S, Nepal&#x27;s economic dependence on India was 95 percent. Seeing this, King Mahendra, established a central bank on 26 April 1956 in order to reduce dependence on India, replace Indian currency being circulated in the market and strengthen the countries&#x27; sovereignty by making Nepal independent in foreign currency exchange. Mahendra had managed to bring this dependency below 60 percent.

The responsibility of notes issuance was transferred from &quot;Sadar Muluki khana&quot; (Central Treasury) to the NRB. On 19 February 1960, NRB released its first bank notes in the denomination of Mohru 1. The Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 1955 and Later, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1963 and Nepal&#x27;s choice for a fixed exchange rate with Indian Currency along with supporting government policies contributed significantly in stabilizing confidence in both the domestic currency and in exchange rate among the local traders. Additionally, during this decade, the national policy of relations with foreign institution were implemented which created the foundation for membership with international organization such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) in 1961. Because of these policies, Nepal succeeded in the circulation of the new Nepalese rupee as the legal tender in Nepal&#x27;s Terai region which was predominated by Indian currencies and facilitated for the elimination of the dual currency period in 1964 in the country and making Nepal independent in foreign currency exchange. Many financial institutions, such as Rastriya Banijya Bank, Rastriya Beema Sansthan, Nepal Co-operative Banks among others were gradually established to make the Nepalese economy more engaging and sustainable.

=== Industrialization of economy ===
In July 1959, Nepal Industrial Development Corporation started serving as an industrial finance organization to expand Nepalese industries and services, including hotels, and industrial estates. King Mahendra laid the foundation of economic development by building physical infrastructure with the help of foreign aid. The foundation for the Industrial Estates (IEs) was laid with the establishment of Balaju Industrial Area in 1963 (2018 BS) with technical and financial assistance from the United States of America (USA). Patan Industrial Area, Hetauda Industrial Area, Dharan Industrial Area, Birgunj Sugar Mill, Nepal Oil Corporation, Janakpur Cigarette Factory, and Balaju Textile Industry were all established during his time. Salt Trading Corporation was established in 1963 (2020 BS), with objective to make iodized table salt accessible to all citizens. Later, again to deal with the import and export for the purpose of rendering support to the economic development of the country Mahendra established National Trading Limited. On 12 March 1969, (Falgun 29, 2025 B.S) with the help of Chinese aid, Mahendra inaugurated Nepal&#x27;s First Brick and Tile Factory in Harisiddhi which started its production two months later in Baishakh 17 2026 BS. Similarly, Bansbari leather Shoe Factory was also established in 1965 with help of Chinese aid. Similarly, he started the era of stocks and bonds by issuing the first Government Bond in 1964. To providing a guaranteed market for milk to the rural farmers with fair price and for the purpose of economic advancement of the farming communities Dairy development corporation (DDC) was established in 1969.

During the Cold War, Nepal tried to boost the economy by creating an environment of economic cooperation between the two neighboring sides.

=== Contribution to health ===

The death of the first wife of King Mahendra due to birth complications led to the building of the kingdom&#x27;s first maternity hospital, Paropakar Shree Panch Indra Rajya Lakshmi Maternity Hospital later renamed as Paropakar Maternity and Women&#x27;s Hospital, commonly known as the Prasuti Griha, on the grounds of Charburja Durbar on 17 August 1959. Kanti Children&#x27;s Hospital was established as a general hospital in 1963 with the economic aid from USSR and was later specialized mainly for children in 1968. In 1964, Royal Drugs laboratory was established to perform scientific research and analysis of drugs as well as development of new drugs. Also, Nepal Ausadhi Limited was established in 1972 with technical collaboration with United Kingdom. In the same year, Institute of Medicine (IOM) was established under Tribhuvan University with the purpose of producing and training all categories of medical manpower required for the nation which immediately initiated courses for Auxiliary Nurse Midwives and Community Medical Assistants. The first ayurvedic school, Rajakiya Ayurvedic Bidyalaya was also established in this year.

Malaria Eradication Project in the Terai region was launched for the first time in 1958 with the help of USAID. After its success, several other projects to control and prevent smallpox, tuberculosis and leprosy were initiated in successive years. Programs to prevent nutritional disorders, and family planning, maternal and child health issues were also launched in successive years.

Various health centers were established between 1955 and 1958 such as in Dailekh (1955), Ramnagar Bhutaha, Sunsari (1956) and Chainpur, Sankhuwasabha (1957). Biratnagar Hospital, Dang Hospital and Baglung Hospital were also opened between 1955 and 1958. In 1958, government announced to build one health center in each 105 electoral constituency and announced to establish zonal hospitals in all 14 zones in 1961. Within this policy the numbers reached 32 for hospitals and 104 for health centers in the public sector In the year 1963.

Similarly in this period, hospitals funded by various NGO missions were established such as Scheer Memorial Hospital in Banepa (1957), Pokhara Shining Hospital in Kaski (1957), Amp Pipal Hospital in Gorkha (1957), Okhaldhunga Hospital in Okhaldhunga (1963), Bulingtar Hospital in Nawalparasi (1962) and United Mission Hospital in Palpa (1954), Anandban Leprosy Hospital in Patan (1963), Green Pasteur Hospital in Kaski (1957) and Dadeldhura Leprosy Hospital in Dadeldhura.

=== Agricultural development ===

To support animal husbandry and agriculture and to modernize the traditional agriculture &quot;Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science&quot; (IAAS) was established in 1957 as an independent institute for the motive of training agriculture technicians which was later brought under Tribhuvan University&#x27;s management. In 1964, to process sugar from sugar cane, Birgunj Sugar Mill was established with economic aid from the then Soviet Union in Parsa. Visioning better future prospects of the Tea industry in Nepal, in 1965 a Tea plantation Estate, Soktim Tea was set up in the plains of Jhapa District. Nepal Tea Development Corporation was established in 1966 by Government of Nepal to aid the development of Tea industry. Agriculture Supply Corporation, which was later split into Nepal Food Corporation, Krishi Samagri Company Ltd. and National Seed Company Ltd was established in 1965 to distribute high quality agricultural inputs such as seeds, and agro-chemicals at a price accessible to the farmers across the country. In order to provide credit to farmers and people of rural areas, financial institutions dedicated to agriculture development, Agricultural Development Bank was established in 1967. This bank has also been executing Small Farmer Development Program (SFDP) for motive of poverty alleviation in rural areas. Agricultural Tools Factory was initially established in Birgunj in 1967 and later also in Biratnagar to produce required agricultural tools for the farmers in cheap cost within the country with the technical and economic aid of Soviet Union. Dhan Chamal Company was established to produce rice produced from the fields of newly extended agriculture region after the extinction of malaria in the Terai region. Eradication of Malaria in the Terai region and the land settlement programs contributed to a massive movement of population from the hills into the Terai, resulting in a large increase in the area devoted to agriculture.

In late 1950s, King Mahendra gave a direct order to make feasibility studies of agricultural development in various parts of the country. In the early 1960s, buckwheat and millet were the main agriculture products in Mustang, which were easy to produce but were extracting very little income since rice and wheat were the main products beyond its borders. The then government of Nepal invested in apple farming for the first time in several areas around the region like mustang and Baitadi, by setting up a regional agricultural outpost in 1966 which was later restructured as the Temperate Horticulture Development Center. Along with the horticulture expert Pasang Sherpa and help of the Nepali army, government tested different varieties of the fruit on various qualities parameters, while disseminating the most successful cultivated ones to local farmers. The technical and economic assistance provided to the farmers, as well as harvest and grooming tools and equipment promoted apples and agro products in Marpha, Jomsom and Thak Khola villages of Mustang which eventually introduced this region as the apple farmland of the country. According to the Companies Act, &quot;The Timber Corporation of Nepal Limited&quot; (TCN), later restructured as Nepal Forest corporation, was established in 1960 to systematically collect and chop firewood produced by forest management and supply it to the general public.

Cigarette was one of the major import during panchayat regime so people were encouraged to cultivate tobacco and Janakpur Cigarette Factory was established to make use of such tobacco and reduce the import of cigarette in the country.

=== Tourism development ===

He also focused on the development of tourism in Nepal. Apparently, he built many houses, rest houses, taverns and water taps in this beautiful country. Under his reign, Nepal was first open to the foreign people laying the foundation of tourism in the nation. The first tourist group aside from the Foreign Diplomat and Bureaucrats arrived for the first time during his reign. In 1959 Nepal became the member of International union of Official travel organization, now known as World Tourism Organization. In the same year, a separate directorate for tourism was setup by the government and a general plan for organization of tourism of Nepal was prepared with cooperation with the Government of France. In 1960 the first handicraft exhibition was performed with the royal approval. In 1964, the King travelled to Rara Lake and penned his famous poem &quot;Rara Ki Apsara&quot; since he got mesmerized by beauty of Rara&quot;.&quot; His visit and the famous poem afterwards brought this lake to limelight and the reader of the poem started visiting the lake. The royal family established Soaltee hotel in 1965 and was inaugurated by King Mahendra in 1966. Similarly, Annapurna Hotel was also established in 1965 with cooperation with foreign diplomats and tourists by the royal family. The hotel tax act was first time devised in 1960 defining hotel, restaurants, casinos and bringing them under the jurisdiction of law. Also, the first professional trekking took place in 1960 when Mahendra opened the Himalayas to tourists for trekking. The first tourism act was enacted in 1964 with the motive of increasing foreign tourist and the first travel agency &quot;Mountain Travel Nepal&quot; was established immediately afterwards. With his initiation, Nepal association of Travel agents was established in 1966. In the same year, eight members of the hotels together established Hotel association of Nepal (HAN) which became one of the main contributors to governmental decisions making regarding tourism. The first casino for the purpose of promoting tourist was established during his reign in 1968. The five-year plan of 1965-1970 devised a plan to dedicate a commission for recognizing and promoting the tourism of the country. Under this plan, a high level Tourism development board was later established in 1969 After being member of the United Nations, King Mahendra invited the UN Secretary General U Thant to Nepal and involved him in the development of Lumbini as a birthplace of Gautam Buddha. With this initiation, a 13 nation International Lumbini development Committee was established in New York to develop the Ancient Lumbini area. It was in his time the famous Hippie trail started in Nepal and Nepal&#x27;s existence started being known to the outside world. The famous Mahendra Cave in Pokhara got his name after he officially inaugurated it and since then it is one of the most visited places in Pokhara. In 1972 a tourism master plan was created emphasizing public-private partnership model with the view of creating more jobs and more revenue to the government. Under this master plan, Hotel management and tourism training center (HMTTC) was established with the economic and technical assistance of ILO and UNDP with the motive to produce skilled workers inside the country in 1972 which was later renamed as Nepal Academy of Tourism and Hotel Management. Later the establishment of Royal Nepal Airlines and opening of Himalayan trek for the first time brought more influx of tourist.

=== Transportation development ===

Earlier, Nepalis were compelled to travel via Indian territory while visiting from one district to another district. King Mahendra ended this situation by constructing a highway with foreign assistance. King Mahendra had initially requested India to build this highway. However, when India refused, he sought the help of the Soviet Union. India was also attracted after the road from Dhalkebar to Pathalaiya was built by Soviet Union, the Mechi section from Dhalkebar (Jhapa to Janakpur) was constructed by India, while the Hetauda-Narayanghat section was constructed by the Asian Development Bank, the Narayanghat -Butwal section by the United Kingdom and the Butwal-Kohalpur section by India. In 1961, King Mahendra laid the foundation stone for the construction of the Mahendra Highway (also called East-West Highway) at Gaindakot. The highway has greatly contributed to the all round socio-economic development of the country. In his efforts to diversify Nepal&#x27;s connectivity beyond India, he created Kodari road link with China&#x27;s Tibet Araniko Highway. India was furious when China said it would build the Kodari Highway. The highway construction was started in June 1963 and completed with Chinese aid in April 1967 (2024 B.S.) Again, with the aid of Indian government, Tribhuvan Rajpath from Hetauda to Thankot was built. This Rajpath was famously known as &quot;By road&quot; when lots of Indians using this road to travel to Kathmandu. Similarly, another major Highway, the Prithvi Highway was also built under King Mahendra&#x27;s plan in 1967 (2024 BS). This highway connects Naubise near Kathmandu to Prithvi Chowk, Pokhara. Kanti Highway, a 92 Kilometer feeder road connecting Lalitpur to Hetauda was started in 1954 by King Mahendra. In 1964, with the help of USAID, Kathmandu-Hetauda ropeway was started to reduce the cost of goods transportation from India.

On 15 June 1955, Tribhuvan International Airport was inaugurated by Mahendra and later named it such in memory of his father. In 1957, department of aviation was established and it started its first scheduled service in 1958. Nepal at the time lacked all weather and blacktopped airports, except the Tribhuvan International Airport, and for aviation to sustain, other airports were built, including airports in Bhairahawa (later renamed as Gautam Buddha Airport), Biratnagar, Bharatpur, Dhangadhi, Pokhara and Simara. In 1959 Rajbiraj Airport was officially inaugurated. Some of these airports were later mothballed.

In the same year, 1959, His Majesty&#x27;s Government established Royal Nepal Airlines Cooperation (RNAC) as a public undertaking, although the required law, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation Act (now Nepal Airlines Corporation Act) was approved only in 1963 (2019 B.S), when King Mahendra enacted Nepal Airlines Corporation Act. Funds were temporarily transferred from construction of suspension bridges to the airline company when the Soviets promised to help with the civil aviation after the King&#x27;s state visit to the Soviet Union. Under his leadership, Nepal became the member of ICAO in 1960. Janakpur Airport and Palungtar Airport was established in 1960 and Nepalgunj Airport and Meghauli Airport in the Chitwan District was established next year in 1961. Bhadrapur Airport was established in 1963, Surkhet Airport in 1966, Syangboche Airport at Solukhumbu was established in 1971 and Rumjatar Airport and Tumlingtar Airport established in 1972. After, the establishment of country own airlines, air service agreement was needed for which first air service agreement was made in 1963. Mahendra also established Sajha Bus Yatayat in order to provide cheap and accessible transport to the local people in 1961.

=== Buildings and structures ===
He built the modern Narayanhiti Palace after the demolition of the old palace from the old Rana architecture. King Mahendra also built Ratna Mandir, the Lakeside palace for Queen Ratna in 1956. Nepal&#x27;s first golf course, the Royal Nepal Golf Club (RNGC) at Tilganga, Kathmandu, was inaugurated on 2022 BS. by him. He is also given credit for the construction of Dasrath Stadium in Kathmandu. Diyalo Bangla, a palace for the former royal family was constructed in Bharatpur, Chitwan to allow former royal family members to relax and hunt wild animals during their visit.

The Koshi River Barrage, a product of multiple ideas to control monsoon floods was constructed during his reign between 1959 and 1963 with the motive of irrigation of agricultural fields, flood control and generation of hydroelectricity. In 1959, king Mahendra and Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru jointly inaugurated and laid foundation of Koshi Barrage. Koshi Barrage was believed to be biggest water project of south Asia at the time of its construction.

A similar dam, the Gandaki river dam was built between the period of 1959 to 1964 on the border between India and Nepal at Gandak for the purpose of flood control, irrigation and hydropower generation. Also, Trisuli dam was built in 1971. In 1956 (2013 BS), the first 1728 KW diesel plant of the country was established for the coronation of king Mahendra which opened the door for supply of electricity to the public and made it more accessible. Hydro Power generated at Trishuli Hydropower Station, Sunkoshi Hydro Power Project, Panauti Hydro Power, Kulekhani Hydro Power are some of the few power projects built during King Mahendra&#x27;s rule. He is also credited for the vision of Kathmandu water project also known as Melamchi Water Supply Project though his early demise could not bring the plan into implementation. The first bridge connecting Nepal with China was also built during his reign in 1964.

=== Educational reforms ===

At the beginning of king&#x27;s reign the literacy rate of the country was estimated to be 5 percent and it reached 10 percent in 1960 while it reached 18 percent in 1971. After the 1960 coup, efforts were made to establish an education system. The All Round National Education Committee was established in 1961, and the National Education Advisory Board in 1968 in order to implement and refine the education system. Nepal &#x27;s 1965&#x27;s education plan and 1971&#x27;s education plan hastened the educational development in the country. In the year 1971 (2028 BS), it was King Mahendra who formulated the education policy of the nation and implemented it by making the Education Act. In this year, Nepal&#x27;s own education came into operation as an integral part of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1970–75) designed to address individual as well as societal needs towards the goals of national development. This new education system boycotted foreign books and education system. Furthermore, he wrote books named Mahendra Malla for schools to give priority to Nepal and Nepali language and boycotted Indian Books. The introduction of the first University of the country, Tribhuvan University was the landmark contributions made by King Mahendra in reforming education sector. At that time King Mahendra&#x27;s family raised 16 lakh rupees by selling gold jewelries in order to fund the project. He later modernized Tribhuvan University, creating conditions for higher education in Nepal, and displaced Indian books from the curriculum. He also started production of books in Nepal with the introduction of Jana Shiksha Samagri Kendra Limited. King Mahendra&#x27;s diplomacy also made arrangements to send Nepali students to study in Russia on scholarships.

As a memorial to his wife, one of the famous public college, Ratna Rajya Campus was established in Putalisadak, Kathmandu and its school was established in Taulihawa, Gorkha, Kathmandu and Mukundapur in 1961 during his reign. With the need to provide higher education institution for a growing settlement n Chitwan, Birendra Intermediate Arts College was established on 13 April 1965 (Baishakh 1, 2022 BS.) later renamed as Birendra Multiple Campus. In order to produce skilled workers inside the country, Pulchowk Engineering Campus was established in 1966 with assistance from Government of India and Thapathali Engineering Campus was established in 1967 with technical assistance of Germany. Later in 1972, these two institutes were brought under the umbrella of Tribhuvan university to constitute the Institute of Engineering. These two engineering institution are still regarded as one of the best engineering institution in the county. The king was in forefront to bring women forward for participation in the society. With the heated discussion to bring women in the schools a girl school was established in Dillibazaar, Kathmandu which was with effort of the king later converted in to a higher institution, Padma kanya campus, and moved to Baghbazar within a greater college premises and facilities 

=== Information and communication development ===
The telephone service in the country was initially, exclusively aimed for use in the Palaces of feudal Rana rulers. However, since the day of coronation of King Mahendra, the first distribution of telephone line was made available to the general public. Beginning in 1959, with support from USAID, Nepal developed 1,000 telephone lines in the capital. It also established its first public exchange in 1962 and converted its manual exchange into the country&#x27;s first automatic telephone exchange within 1964. In 1961 (2018 BS) Rastriya Samachar Samiti commonly abbreviated as RSS, was established under the Rastriya Samachar Samiti Act, 2019 B.S, with a view to facilitate news for newspapers and broadcasting media. It is still one of the major source of news and photos in the nation. Understanding the value of newspaper in spreading knowledge and information, he modernized Gorkhapatra and converted it from weekly newspaper it to a daily newspaper in 1961. Similarly, to address the English language influence and increment of foreign tourists, The Rising Nepal was established on 16 December 1965 (1 Poush 2022 BS) by the then Panchayat Government. In 1971, Nepal received its first telex service. He increased tower infrastructures so that Radio Nepal could reach all corners of the country.

=== Political reforms ===

After the 1962 war between China and India, Chinese troops occupied mountain areas east and west of Nepal in an attempt to resolve border disputes with India by simply occupying disputed territories. The reversal, Indian armed force were deployed in the country&#x27;s northern border. and Indian diplomats were involved in the ministry as well as every decisions made by the Nepalese Government. King Mahendra played an important role to oust the Indian armed force from Nepali territory. Moreover, there were multiple representatives from India claiming that Nepal cannot handle its foreign policy and defense policy on its own. King Mahendra removed all the Indian representatives and politicians from the ministry and only kept Nepalese representatives. He was the first king to introduce constitution as the fundamental law in the country. King Mahendra incorporated the phrase &#x27;Hindu Kingdom&#x27; in the newly introduced constitution. He scientifically divided Nepal into 14 administrative zones with 75 districts in it. In order to perform proper administration and to secure decentralization of power to every zone, each zones were appointed a zonal commissioners. This was the first decentralization of power in history of Nepal. There were more than 4000 villages and 35 municipalities. Every village was divided into nine wards and every municipalities were divided between 9-35 wards as per the size of the town. During his rule an extensive legal and judicial reforms were carried out. In order to provide good governance and social justice to people he nullified Royal courts and introduced local courts in 1961 through introduction of two new acts Petty States and Rulers Act and royal court nullification act (Nepali: राज्य रजौटा ऐन, २०१७ र राज्य अदालत उन्मूलन ऐन, २०१७) and introduced Supreme court in Nepal on 21 May 1956. Even though royalty act removed many smaller kings, it still recognized 17 small kings including that of Salyan, Bajhang, Jajarkot, Mustang, Bhirkot, Malneta and Darna. King Mahendra publicly declared his will for rule of law in the nation. The &quot;Legal Practitioners Act, in 1968&quot; was introduced to institutionalize this willingness of a systematic rule. He introduced the separation of power within the state by dividing legislative power to the &quot;Rastriya Panchayat&quot;, executive power to the Council of ministers and judicial power to the Supreme Court. The Commissions of Inquiry Act introduced in 1969 opened the legal means through which government could appoint various investigative committees for the purpose of making inquiries into matters of national importance He also established the Office of the Auditor General in Nepal by appointing the first auditor general in 1963 according to the Nepalese constitution of 1958. Section 77 and Section 78 of Part 13 of 1962 constitution provided a provision for establishment of Public Service Commission to employ and train government officials in the country. Section 78 (a b c) of Part 13 (a) of the same constitution made the arrangement of the Election Commission which later became the sole authority to regulate and conduct elections in the country.

=== Social reforms ===
In 1955 (2012 B.S), with the enactment of the Police Act, there were attempts to boost the morale of the army. National Police Academy was established under this act. The electricity produced in the country at the beginning was exclusively aimed for use in the Palaces of feudal rulers. However, since the day of coronation of King Mahendra in 1955, electricity became more open and accessible to the public. On 17 August 1963 a new legal code was promulgated replacing the Muluki Ain of 1854 with the new Muluki ain. The Muluki Ain (people&#x27;s code) and made attempt to break untouchables, caste discrimination and policy of gender-discrimination. He then introduced the Nepal Civil Service Act to develop employee skills, ending the long era of the Panjani practice. Nepal Public Commission was established under this act for reforming and developing the civil service. This move ended the long-standing tradition of directly electing, dismissing and transferring government officials by the king and started the tradition of electing only eligible candidates. In 1963, a Central Police Training Centre was established to train and reform the police. &quot;Rajya&quot; reform abolished special privileges of some aristocratic elites in western Nepal. The new &quot;panchayat&quot; system managed to bring 50,000 to 60,000 people into a single system of representative government in a way that had been rendered impossible for the elite-based political parties. Nepal was able to carry out its second plan (1962–65) and third plan (1965-70), and to begin the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1970–75). He was also the first ruler to bring high class Brahmin rulers under the equal rule of punishment. His wife, queen Ratna had huge love for children for which he desired to establish an orphanage. So he provided 25 ropanies of land to establish the first orphanage of the country to Daya Bir Kansakar under the name of Paropkar Sansthan. Moreover, he became the first king to donate blood in Nepal in order to create awareness between people about blood donation. He was also concerned about illegal Indians entering the nation and taking benefit in the name of local, so he introduced the system of citizenship in 1964.

=== Promotion of art, history and culture ===

In order to preserve the local traditions, religion and culture, way of life, festivals and languages, he had established the Royal Nepal Academy (Nepali:- नेपाल राजकीय प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठान) and National Dance Academy (Nepali: राष्ट्रिय नाचघर) and other institutions. Royal Nepal Academy later renamed as Nepal Academy started translating foreign literature to Nepali language giving access to the people for foreign literature. In 1961 Nepal Association of fine arts later known as Nepal Academy of Fine Arts (Nepali:नेपाल ललित कला प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठान ) was established. This along with Srijana Fine Arts School were some prominent established made to promote contemporary art in the nation. Furthermore, under the instruction of Mahendra, the government established Ratna Recording Sansthan to facilitate Nepali artists who otherwise were travelling to Calcutta for recording songs. This corporation paired with Radio Nepal to increase the reach of produced records of Nepali national music. King Mahendra was a great lover of Art. In his leadership National Numismatic Museum was established in 1962 to preserve the national history, art and culture. To promote the art and the artist in the nation, he conceived a Public-Private partnership organization and established Nepal Art Council in 1962. In 1962, Nepal Sahitya Sansthan was established to stimulate public&#x27;s interest in art and culture through literature. In 1965, Panchayat Government initiated a program where actors and directors were sent to India for special training. Later, Mahendra Pragya Puraskar was introduced which awarded to contributors of Nepali language, arts and culture every two years. King Mahendra as a chancellor of Nepal academy started the tradition of All Nepal poetry competition on his birthday where winners are awarded with cash prizes. In 1966, on the personal request of Mahendra, the first private bannered Film, Maitighar was produced in the country. Mahendra wrote songs for the film and also provided some funding. In 1967, National archive was established to document and preserve the history and historical documents. Kaiser Library was established in 1969 when the ownership of Kaiser Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana&#x27;s history and books collection came under the ownership of the government. King Mahendra made this property accessible to the public with the donated personal collection by his widow Krishna Chandra Kumari Devi. In 1970, the king discussed with Dev Anand, an Indian actor, director and producer, to produce film in Nepal to promote the local cultural heritage and depict the hippie culture. The movie showcased the cultural heritage of the country to the world for the first time such as ancient Kasthamandap, Basantapur Durbar Square as well as Bhaktapur durbar square and showcased the hippie culture.

=== Promotion of religion ===
Royal Nepal Academy started translating religious text to Nepali and Sanskrit language giving access to the people for religious text.

The constitution introduced by King Mahendra in 1962 officially recognized Hindu religion as the state religion. In addition to that, it introduced national emblem such as crimson colour as the national colour, the cow as the national animal which had its root in Hinduism. The constitution guaranteed promotion of Hindu religious festivals and religious discourses including the use of Sanskrit and a ban on proselytizing. Being a state religion, Hinduism was promoted and protected under the expense of the state and prohibited the slaughter of the animal. Under his reign, the king and the queen was started being worshipped in every Nepalese homes as the incarnation of Vishnu.

After being member of the UN, King Mahendra invited the UN Secretary General U Thant to Nepal and involved him in the development of Lumbini as a birthplace of Gautam Buddha.

In 1962 (2021 BS), King Mahendra, set up a Guthi Sansthan with the objectives to continue preservation and promotion of festivals, heritage and culture of the people. During the kings reign, Sikhism flourished in Nepal as a number of Sikhs entered Nepal as a businessman with the permission of the king. King Mahendra was the one to provide first citizenship to Sikhs for their help during the drought in 1960s. During his entire rule, he enhanced the religious responsibilities of the royal family and enhanced the ritual status of the king in the society by routinely referencing himself in his speeches and writings &quot;as the last remaining Hindu king of the world&quot; He also promoted Dashain as a religious practice to integrate the entire state through integration of the local leaders into national government. All local and regional leaders were expected to receive Tika from the hands of the king and similarly from their bureaucratic superior and thus dispensing the political hierarchy from the center to all the corners of the country. Dashain embraced the vision of the panchayat regime to create a religiously and ethnically homogeneous society which accepted an hierarchical system with the king at its center to bring the country into a single integrated unit.

=== Land reforms ===
In 1959, the Birta Abolition Act was enacted which gave poor people and farmers ownership to the land they were historically working on. Birta land was then converted into Raikar through this act. Similarly, the Land Survey and Measurement Act was introduced in 1962. It classified land as Abal, Doyam, Sim, and Chahar. This act effectively established a Land Administration Office (Nepali:भूमि प्रशासन कार्यालय). The Agricultural Reorganization Act, passed in 1963 emphasized security for tenant farmers and put a ceiling on landholdings. Likewise, land reform act 1964 ended the feudal land ownership practice and secured the right of farmers. This land reform policy led to the confiscation of large Rana estates and provided land to many landless people. In the meantime, the Land Administration Act, 1966 was promulgated which further reformed the land administration office changing it into Land Revenue office(Nepali: मालपोत कार्यालय). Moreover, He had provided accommodation to ex- soldiers who knew how to wield weapons and to Nepalese who were expelled from Burma and set up settlements of Nepalis in the Terai from Jhapa to Kanchanpur so that the Indians would not oppress them. He also provided passport to the people of Manang region and waived custom duty for them so that the people of the region could use their lands to grow herbs and trade in the nearby regions. Eradication of Malaria and the land settlement programs contributed to a massive movement of population from the hills into the Terai, resulting in a large increase in the area devoted to agriculture.

== Criticisms ==
=== Dismantling of democracy ===
Mahendra seized power after dissolving the government of Nepali Congress, jailed any objectors and moved steadily towards an authoritarian rule. He considered political parties anti-national elements and put a complete ban on them in favor of a partyless system. While he believed himself to be a supporter of democracy and considered the Panchayat system to be a democratic regime, the claim was rejected by many. He also criticized and objected to King Tribhuvan&#x27;s decision to accept a multiparty democracy and an arrangement for a constituent assembly. Mahendra once said, &quot;The constitution is given by the King. It is not supposed to be made by the people. &quot;(&quot;translated from Nepali&quot;).

=== Authoritarianism ===
Mahendra gave himself absolute power following the coup and tried to establish his image as a patriotic and benevolent ruler. He suppressed all his critics and launched a propaganda campaign through radio, newspapers and pamphlets that boosted his popularity among the people and established himself as a god-like figure. Critics also see his one-country one-language one-monarch policy as the height of his abuse of authority. Some people also claim that his introduction of the reformed Muluki Ain was not to bring equality in the society but rather to give death sentences to the Brahmin leaders of rebellions who had tried to assassinate him.

Some critics claim that Mahendra stole the development plans of B.P Koirala and credited himself as the architect of the developmental process of the era. Mahendra made a conscious effort to consolidate his hold over the Nepalese Army.

=== &quot;One-Country, One-monarch, One-language, One-dress&quot; policy ===
Mahendra&#x27;s efforts to unite the multicultural country under a singular culture have faced heavy criticism from progressives. The system equated the identity of the country with the Nepali as the language, the Daura-Suruwal as the national dress and Hinduism as the national religion. Everyone was required to wear a Dhaka topi for official purposes: to acquire their citizenship, passport, and driving license. This was criticized to be one sided as it dominated a country with pluralism and completely ignored the existence of the many minority groups within the country. This policy was disseminated in the Nepali language textbooks titled as &#x27;Mahendramala&#x27; during the Panchayat era.

=== Accusations of creating an institution favoring the rich ===
Many critics consider the Panchayat system to be an institution that innately favored the rich and Mahendra to be the patron saint of the feudal lords and landlords of the country. Ganesh Man Singh criticized the establishment of the Nepal Rastra Bank saying, &quot;The Central Bank, opened for the benefit of landlords and right-wing traders, does not benefit the poor.&quot; (&quot;translated from Nepali&quot;) Some also argue that the 1960 coup happened because the then BP Koirala government could not keep the feudal lords happy.

=== Memorial constructions ===

Mahendra was criticized for constructing various memorials and statues for himself and his wife and for naming various landmarks, schools and parks after him and his family members. Ratna Park, named after King Mahendra&#x27;s wife Rani Ratna, a prime example of it. The statue of Queen Ratna Rajya Lakshmi Devi at Ratnapark was vandalized by republican protestors in 2062 BS. The Kathmandu Metropolitan City changed the name of the park to Shankdhar Udyan in 2077 BS and erected a statue of Sankhadar Shakwa instead of the one of Queen Ratna. Similarly, naming various development projects like Prithvi highway, Mahendra highway, Kanti highway, Tribhuvan airport etc. after their family members was seen as his attempt to improve the image of the royal family among the common people.

=== Failed land-reform policy ===
The land-reform policy introduced by Mahendra is considered to be a major failure by many people. Land reform efforts began with the enactment of the Land and Cultivation Record Compilation Act (1956), through which the government began compiling tenant records and continued with the Lands Act (1957). These acts were not much successful in increasing small farmers so further efforts had to made. The Agricultural Reorganization Act, passed in 1963 emphasized security for tenant farmers and put a ceiling on landholdings. Likewise, land reform act 1964 ended the feudal land ownership practice and secured the right of farmers. However, there were loopholes in the acts which allowed landlords to control most of the lands. Though, these policies were successful in securing the rights of farmers, it was not so in the case of land redistribution. Until 1972, average landholdings remained small. Moreover, the double ownership law of land introduced by the Panchayat through &#x27;Mohiyai hak&#x27; became a major hindrance in development in the decades to come.

=== Child-less second marriage ===
After the death of his first wife Indra Rajya in 1950, Prince Mahendra had a love affair with his sister-in-law Ratna, but despite strong opposition from his father King Tribhuvan, Prince Mahendra married Ratna Rajyalakshmi two years later. This strained relations between him and his father. Mahendra has faced much criticism for this marriage. Some people criticise him for disobeying his father and disregarding the obedience of a prince to the King of Nepal. Some people also criticise him for sterilising his new wife before marriage and depriving his wife of her right to be a mother.

== Death and succession ==
Mahendra suffered a massive second heart attack whilst on a winter hunting trip in Chitwan where he was attended to by his trusted physicians Dr Mrigendra Raj Pandey and Dr Sachey Kumar Pahari. King Mahendra was in a stable but critical condition and eventually died at Diyalo Bangala, the royal palace in Bharatpur on 31 January 1972. His body was subsequently flown to Kathmandu by helicopter in preparation for the state funeral.

His 26-year-old son Birendra ascended the Nepalese throne immediately after his father&#x27;s death. However, his coronation took place only on 24 February 1975 at the age of 29 due to Hindu ritual for an auspicious date and the astrologers had claimed only that time to be auspicious.

== Personality ==
Historians define Mahendra as an ambitious ruler. He was courageous and visionary who would not be reluctant to take any steps. Swiss scholar, Toni Hagen described him as very clever ruler who could handle delicate issues. He was a deep admirer of Nepalese literature, art and culture which led to himself composing several poems which were later sung by many famous singers. He was proficient in Nepali, English, Hindi and Sanskrit.

== Hobbies ==
Mahendra went in for various activities like noblemen of his era and subsequent eras. MBB Shah (Nepali: म. वी. वि. शाह) is the literary name of King Mahendra. MBB Shah is a more passionate poet of the Romantic section of Nepali poetry. King Mahendra wrote various songs and poems. He is also called the first lyricist of Nepal by some sources. He penned &quot;Lolayeka Tee&quot;&quot;, Gajalu Tee Thula Thula Aakha,&quot; &quot;Garchin Pukar Aaama,&quot; &quot;Aakashma Tirmire,&quot; &quot;Kina Kina Timro Tasbir,&quot; ma mare pani mero desh bachi rahos, Rara ki Apsara etc. which were later sung by Gulam Ali and Lata Mangeshkar. He was also fond of hunting and would regularly go to hunting with his queen to different places.

== Offspring ==
Four of his children were killed in the 2001 royal massacre. Other than his six children, King Mahendra also had a son from one of his concubine Gita Gurung, who was born before any other child from his legal marriage. Gita worked in the royal palace as a servant when Mahendra was a prince.

== Memorial ==
Many structures, institutions, locations and honors have been built and introduced in the memory of King Mahendra. Monuments erected in his name were renamed after the restoration of the parliament in 2063 BS and the end of the monarchy in 2065 BS. After the political changes of 2063 BS, an attempt was made to rename the highway built in the name of the king as Lok Marg. Even though the Ratna Park named after his queen was renamed as Shankhadhar Sakhwa Park, Ratna Park is still popular among the people. A species of groundhopper (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) discovered from Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park by a team led by Nepali researcher Madan Subedi has been named after King Mahendra as &quot;Skejotettix mahendrai&quot; Subedi, Kasalo, &amp; Skejo, 2024, commonly known as &quot;Royal Groundhopper&quot;.

<text>The Philip A. Hart Senate Office Building is the third U.S. Senate office building, and is located on 2nd Street NE between Constitution Avenue NE and C Street NE, northeast of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., in the United States. Construction began in January 1975, and it was first occupied in November 1982. Rapidly rising construction costs plagued the building, creating several unfortunate scandals. The structure is named for Philip A. Hart (1912-1976), who served 18 years as a United States Senator from Michigan. Accessed via a spur of the United States Capitol Subway System, the building features a nine-story atrium dominated by massive artwork, and a large Central Hearing Facility which provides television facilities as well as extensive seating.

==Design and construction==
The Dirksen Senate Office Building was intended to occupy the entire block bounded by 1st Street NE, Constitution Avenue NE, 2nd Street NE, and C Street NE. However, due to the resource and financial demands of the Korean War, the building was scaled back and occupied only the western half of this area.
In 1969, Congress voted to acquire the eastern half of the block for a &quot;New Senate Office Building&quot;. Originally, the Senate intended only to build a $21 million ($ in dollars) underground parking garage here. That effort was approved in June 1971. But in May 1972, the Subcommittee on Buildings of the Senate Committee on Public Works approved a plan to construct the New Senate Office Building above the parking garage. The building&#x27;s cost was estimated at $48 million ($ in dollars) in June 1972. The full Senate approved the building plan in September 1972, but by then the building&#x27;s estimated cost had risen to $53.5 million ($ in dollars).

In April 1973, the Architect of the Capitol awarded the architectural design contract to John Carl Warnecke, a nationally prominent architect working in the District of Columbia who had helped save Lafayette Square and designed the John F. Kennedy grave site. Warnecke&#x27;s design for the building was approved by the Senate Committee on Public Works on August 8, 1974. Warnecke was given just two weeks to come up with the cost estimate, which the Architect of the Capitol later claimed was far too little time to generate an accurate cost forecast. By the end of the year, the estimated cost of construction had risen to $69 million.

Ground for the new structure was broken in January 1975, and by the time ground clearance began in April the building&#x27;s cost had risen to $84 million ($ in dollars). The poor and uneven condition of the soil at the site caused delays in the excavation, and major cost increases. When the foundations were finished, it was discovered that many of the anchoring bolts were misaligned and had to be replaced. This also added extensive new costs to the project.

On August 30, 1976, the Senate voted to name the new office building the Philip A. Hart Senate Office Building in honor of retiring Senator Philip Hart (D-Michigan). Hart died on December 26, 1976, of melanoma, having declined to run for reelection the previous November.

By August 1978, actual construction costs were now $85 million ($ in dollars) and were expected to top $122 million ($ in dollars). The Senate approved a plan to spend another $54 million ($ in dollars) on the structure, and cap costs at $135 million ($ in dollars). Initially, the House approved this plan. But when constituents bitterly complained, the House reversed itself on both counts. By 1979, construction estimates had soared to $179 million ($ in dollars), and the General Accounting Office said it would rise to $230 million ($ in dollars) without changes. In July 1979, the Senate agreed to cap costs at $137.7 million ($ in dollars) after an acrimonious three-hour debate during which some senators suggested the building be torn down. The Architect of the Capitol ordered changes in the design to keep construction costs under the $137.7 million cap. These included elimination of a penthouse-level dining room, $906,000 ($ in dollars) in furnishings for an interior gymnasium, oak paneling for each senator&#x27;s office, dimmer switches for lights, a $400,000 ($ in dollars) art gallery, $227,000 ($ in dollars) in carpeting for auxiliary space, $167,700 ($ in dollars) for vertical blinds, and $1.2 million ($ in dollars) for finishes and furnishings for a large central hearing room with hidden multimedia bays.

The Hart Senate Office Building was completed in September 1982 at a cost of $137.7 million ($ in dollars). The Architect of the Capitol argued that the significantly higher costs of the Hart Senate Office building were due to the unexpected excavation issues, the foundation construction errors, Senate-ordered changes, high inflation, and some mismanagement of the construction project. Architect of the Capitol George M. White argued the construction cost was a reasonable $110 per square foot. Architect John Carl Warnecke defended the building&#x27;s cost, noting that it almost doubled in size (from to ), and that building costs in the District of Columbia leapt 76 percent during its erection. Warnecke dismissed allegations about Senate-ordered changes, saying these increased costs just 2 percent, and said that construction alone was just $107 million ($ in dollars) (with another $28 million ($ in dollars) coming from administrative costs, fees, and furnishings). He argued that excellent construction management held inflation in construction costs to just 67 percent, and that the building was erected at a cost of $97 per square foot, &quot;well below the costs of any other major public building built in the District during that period.&quot; However, the American Institute of Architects said commercial construction costs in Washington, D.C., ranged from $54 to $65 per square foot, and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported the cost of the building at $137.70 per square foot.

The building was first occupied on November 22, 1982. The structure contained offices for 50 senators, but 25 of them refused to move into the structure. To save costs, the building gave each person a cubicle, rather than an office, which greatly upset Senate staff. To resolve the issue, junior senators (not normally able to choose which offices they wanted, nor obtain spacious and well-equipped ones) were able to claim the large, modern offices in the Hart Senate Office Building.

In late 1982, the Senate found $9.5 million ($ in dollars) in unused funds, which it designated to pay for the modular furniture and partitions for use in the Hart building.

==Structure==

The Hart Senate Office Building consists of nine above-ground stories. The structure has of internal floor space, of which is usable.

Instead of the Neoclassical architectural style of the Dirksen and Russell Senate Office Buildings, the Hart Senate Office Building is Modernist. To fit within the context provided by the Dirksen and Russell buildings, Hart&#x27;s building lines were designed to mesh with those of the earlier structures and the new building clad in dazzlingly white marble from Vermont. The marble was thick, twice the usual thickness for an office building, and used to cover even the most mundane aspects of the structure (such as the mechanical shed on the roof). More than of marble were needed for interior and exterior use.

To echo the courtyards of Dirksen and Russell, the Hart building has an atrium covered by a vast skylight. The walls of the interior of the structure, including the atrium, are clad in the same white Vermont marble as the exterior. The atrium&#x27;s floor, however, is rose-colored Tennessee marble. Walkways on the interior of the atrium provide access to each office suite.

The public entrance to each suite is on an odd-numbered floor, with private staff entrances on even-numbered floors. Each office suite contains a private office for a senator which has outward-facing windows and has high ceilings. Due to the building&#x27;s layout, a workspace with identical ceilings and views is adjacent to each senator&#x27;s office. Workspace elsewhere in the suite exists on a main floor and a mezzanine, connected by an internal stairs. This office space has unusually low high ceilings. All workspace is generally free of columns and walls. A partition system consisting of oak frames covered in sound-absorbent fabric, designed and manufactured by Acoustical Screen Corporation, was designed for use in providing a flexible partition system in each office. These partitions were originally purchased for only a handful of offices, due to cutbacks in the building&#x27;s furnishing budget. Each office also has a private restroom.

Manhole covers in the sidewalks and streets nearby were made of bronze, to avoid unsightly rust stains from traditional iron manhole covers (the usual material). The interior elevator doors were also cast in bronze, and areas in the floors in suites, meeting rooms, and some public areas had removable panels and built-in tubing which allowed for the easy replacement or upgrading of electrical, telecommunications, and computer wiring. The cafeteria beneath the Dirksen Senate Office Building was doubled in size and extended beneath the Hart building, which allowed the public to use for the first time during lunch hours.

The structure&#x27;s $137 million cost did not include furnishing, which Senate experts estimated would cost another $32.6 million ($ in dollars). Unspecified changes made by Warnecke led to $4.2 million ($ in dollars) in cost savings, however. These allowed certain items to be restored, such as the large hearing room, auxiliary area carpeting, vertical blinds, and the gymnasium equipment (now estimated to cost just $736,000 ($ in dollars)). The cost savings also allowed the Architect of the Capitol to build a tennis court on the building&#x27;s roof.

Below the structure is a 350-car parking garage.

The building&#x27;s design deliberately spared the adjacent Sewall–Belmont house, a historic structure that serves as headquarters for the National Woman&#x27;s Party and a museum about the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

===Central Hearing Facility===

The Central Hearing Facility was completed in October 1987, and used for the first time in January 1988. Located on the second floor of the Hart Senate Office Building, the two-story high room has studio-quality television lighting built into the ceiling. Booths built into the sides of the room are elevated and can accommodate television camera crews. Above them are glassed-in booths where television reporters and news presenters can report from without disturbing the proceedings below.

The Central Hearing Facility is lavishly paneled and has a stone backdrop behind the dais.

Public access to the Central Hearing Facility is controlled via two foyers, accessible from the public hallways. Privately, members of Congress, their staff, and often witnesses access the hearing room from nondescript doors on the second floor of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. A small &quot;green room&quot;, hidden behind the back wall of the Central Hearing Facility, provides a waiting room and space for individuals to prepare before entering the main hearing room.

===Subway access===
A spur of the United States Capitol Subway System was constructed to connect the Hart Senate Office Building to the subway&#x27;s main track beneath the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The spur opened when the new building did. In 1989, the Senate approved a plan to upgrade the subway beneath the Hart and Dirksen office buildings. The changes included four new cars capable of seating 25 people (up from 18), making platforms and cars wheelchair-accessible, and automating these cars (eliminating the need for car conductors). The changes were expected to produce savings of $122,000 ($ in dollars) a year and cut waiting times to two minutes from four. Transportation Group Inc., of Orlando, Florida, was paid $15.8 million ($ in dollars) and the Architect of the Capitol received $2 million ($ in dollars) to design and manufacture the new subway cars and system. The system was finished in 1994.

===Atrium===
The atrium in the Hart Senate Office Building is high and capped by a lighting system and skylight. The skylight is actually 18 separate skylights, each of which has nine panels. A four-globe light fixture is suspended from each skylight. Each light fixture has an electric motor which can lower the fixture to the lobby floor so that bulbs can be replaced.

Beginning in 2014, major renovations and repairs were made to the roof of the Hart building. The roof had reached the end of its life and was replaced. The skylights, which leaked extensively and were causing damage to the building, were also replaced. To enhance the building&#x27;s energy efficiency, solar panels capable of generating 148 kilowatts of solar power were installed on the roof. The entire roof project cost about $11.3 million ($ in dollars).

===&quot;Mountains and Clouds&quot;===

The atrium is dominated by the sculptural work &quot;Mountains and Clouds&quot; by Alexander Calder. The upper part of the work consists of a mobile, &quot;Clouds&quot;, made from curved aluminum plates suspended from the roof on a shaft. The largest section of the mobile measures roughly , and the entire mobile weighs about . Crystallization Systems, Inc. of New York manufactured the mobile. A computer-controlled motor moves the mobile.

The lower part of the work consists of a stabile made of four flat, triangular-shaped steel plates painted matte black and supported by two curving legs. Sources differ as to how tall the stabile is, with reported heights of , , and . The stabile weighs about or . The Segré Foundry of Waterbury, Connecticut, manufactured the stabile.

&quot;Mountains and Clouds&quot; was the last work Calder completed. He was in Washington, D.C., on November 10, 1976, to show the finalized maquette to Architect of the Capitol George White. White gave his approval for the full-size work to be installed at the Hart Senate Office Building. Calder flew to his daughter&#x27;s home in New York, and died of a heart attack at 6:00 AM on November 11.

During the budget battles in 1979 over the cost of the Hart Senate Office Building, funds for completion of the Calder work were deleted. But Senator Nicholas F. Brady, who had been appointed to serve out the unexpired term of Senator Harrison A. Williams (who had resigned on March 11, 1982, after his bribery conviction in the Abscam scandal), decided in June 1982 to establish the Capitol Art Foundation. The foundation&#x27;s goal was to raise funds for the placement of art through the United States Capitol Complex. By June 1985, the foundation had raised $250,000 ($ in dollars) to manufacture and $400,000 ($ in dollars) to install &quot;Mountains and Clouds&quot;. Most of the money came from billionaire art collector Paul Mellon and C. Douglas Dillon. The work was dedicated in a ceremony held on May 5, 1987.

Some time after the installation of the work, the motor malfunctioned and the mobile portion of &quot;Mountains and Clouds&quot; stopped rotating. When this happened is unclear, with one source saying shortly after the work&#x27;s installation and another saying about 2005. In 2015, Senator Chris Murphy began a fundraising effort to restore the mobile to operation.

&quot;Mountains and Clouds&quot; is considered a one-of-a-kind work, as it is the only work by Calder to combine a mobile and a stabile. &quot;He had mounted the forms atop one another before, but had never used them separately in a single piece as he anticipated to do with moving clouds and stationary mountains,&quot; says Capitol Hill reporter Justin Cox.

After the 2011 Virginia earthquake, there were concerns that the mobile might have become unsafe. It was lowered to the ground in 2014, and a complete safety check of the work conducted. It was restored to its suspended position in 2015.

==Events==
===Anthrax attack===
On October 15, 2001, several suites of this building became contaminated by the release of anthrax powder from an envelope mailed to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle in the 2001 anthrax attacks. The building was closed October 17, 2001, displacing hundreds of Senate staff. The building was decontaminated using chlorine dioxide gas from November to December 2001, and the building reopened January 23, 2002.

==Committee offices==
As of 2016, three Senate committees had offices located inside Hart Senate Office Building:
*United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs
*United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics
*United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

<text>Sidmouth () is a town on the English Channel in Devon, South West England, southeast of Exeter. With a population of 13,258 in 2021, it is a tourist resort and a gateway to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. A large part of the town has been designated a conservation area.

==History==
The origins of Sidmouth pre-date recorded history. The Sid valley has been in human occupation since at least the Iron Age as attested by the presence of Sidbury Castle, and possibly earlier given the presence of Bronze Age burial mounds on Gittisham Hill and Broad Down. The village of Sidbury itself is known to be Saxon in origin with the Church crypt dating to the seventh century. However, the Sid Valley was divided into two ecclesiastical land holdings, with Sidbury and Salcombe Regis being gifted by King Athelstan to Exeter Cathedral, and Sidmouth, which was part of the manor of Otterton, was gifted by Gytha Thorkelsdóttir (the mother of King Harold Godwinson) to the Benedictines at Mont-Saint-Michel.

Sidmouth appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Sedemuda&quot;, meaning &quot;mouth of the Sid&quot;. Like many such settlements, it was originally a fishing village.

By the 1200s, Sidmouth had expanded to become a market town of similar size to Sidbury and generating more income for the abbot of Mont-Saint-Michel than Otterton. By this time, Sidmouth already had a parish church, as the Otterton Cartulary refers to a grant of 30 acres of land to Guilielmas, the vicar in Sidmouth, as a glebe, and excavations in 2009 during the remodelling of the parish church revealed foundations dating from that time. It is likely that the church was already dedicated to St Giles, as the annual fair was held on his feast day 1 September. According to one of the many blue plaques found around Sidmouth, not far from the church was a chapel dedicated to St Peter built sometime before 1322, the remaining wall of which is now part of Dukes Hotel.

During the 14th century, Sidmouth enjoyed a degree of prosperity from the wine trade and, as part of the manor of Otterton, was transferred by King Henry V from Mont-Saint-Michel to Syon Abbey. King Henry VIII confiscated it again during the dissolution of the monasteries and sold it off, whereafter it changed hands several times before being acquired by the Mainwaring baronets, whose family provided two of the vicars of Sidmouth parish.

Although attempts have been made to construct a harbour, none has succeeded. A lack of shelter in the bay prevented the town&#x27;s growth as a port. Despite this, a part of the town is known as &#x27;Port Royal&#x27; which is likely due to the town&#x27;s having provided two ships and 67 men to King Edward III during the Hundred Years&#x27; War with which to attack Calais. The most concerted effort was a short-lived attempt in the 1830s at the west of the seafront; this included the construction of the Sidmouth Harbour Railway along the seafront and into a tunnel at the cliffs to the east that would have transported stone from Hook Ebb. Only a few traces of the railway and tunnel survive today. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) operated a lifeboat station at Sidmouth between 1869 and 1912.

According to one of the Sid Vale Association Blue Plaques, a fort was built in Sidmouth in 1628, due to fear of a French invasion or naval attack, on the part of the seafront that is known as &#x27;Fortfield&#x27; and which is now the cricket pitch.

Another of the Blue Plaques of the Sid Vale Association, confirms that the Old Ship pub (now a Costa Coffee) had operated as a tavern in Sidmouth since the 1400s and was used by smugglers. The infamous Jack Rattenbury, who was born nearby in Beer, Devon operated in the area, and was known to associate with the Mutter family of Ladram Bay (after whom Mutter&#x27;s Moor on Peak Hill overlooking Sidmouth is named).

Sidmouth remained a village until the fashion for coastal resorts grew in the Georgian and Victorian periods of the 18th and 19th centuries. A number of Georgian and Regency buildings still remain. In 1819, George III&#x27;s son Edward, Duke of Kent, his wife, and baby daughter (the future Queen Victoria) came to stay at Woolbrook Glen for a few weeks. In less than a month he had died of pneumonia. The house later became the Royal Glen Hotel; a plaque on an exterior wall records the visit. Sidmouth was connected to the railway network in 1874, by a branch line from Sidmouth Junction, which from there called at Ottery St Mary and Tipton St John. This was dismantled in 1967 as a result of the Beeching Axe.
In 2008, Canadian millionaire Keith Owen, who had been on holiday in the town and planned to retire there, bequeathed about £2.3 million to the community&#x27;s civic society, the Sid Vale Association, upon learning that he had only weeks to live due to lung cancer. The bequest was used as a capital fund to generate an annual interest dividend of around £120,000 for community projects.

==Demographics==

At the 2011 census the population was 12,569, with a median age of 59.

At the 2021 census the population of Sidmouth Town was 4,400 and 2,300 households.

==Geography==

Sidmouth lies at the mouth of the River Sid in a valley between Peak Hill to the west and Salcombe Hill to the east. It is surrounded by the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is on the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site, and the South West Coast Path. The red-coloured rock indicates the arid conditions of the Triassic geological period.

Erosion of the cliffs to the east of the river mouth threatens homes and the coastal footpath, and is a serious concern.

The wide esplanade has been a prominent feature since Regency times. A series of southwesterly storms in the early 1990s washed away much of the shingle beach protecting the masonry. A set of artificial rock islands was constructed to protect the sea front, and tons of pebbles were trucked in to replace the beach.

Sidmouth has a number of conservation projects, notably the arboretum which in 2012 designated all land owned by Sidmouth Town Council as &#x27;civic arboretum&#x27;, the first town in the United Kingdom to do so.

===Climate===
The highest temperature recorded since 1990 in Sidmouth is 28 °C (82 °F) in July 2018, and the coldest is -5 °C (23 °F) in February 1991 and March 2018.

Sidmouth has a distinct microclimate; the seafront is surrounded by cliffs and hills which shelters it from rainfall. It also protects the town from wind and decreases frosts as the surrounding topography traps in the warmth from the sea. The town receives around 1,665 hours of sunshine on average.

==Transport==
Sidmouth&#x27;s main road access is via the A3052. This provides access to Exeter and the M5 motorway away.

Irregular bus services connect to Exeter up to every half-hour by Stagecoach South West and to Honiton or Seaton. 
Sidmouth is also served by AVMT Buses&#x27; service 899, which runs from Seaton to Sidmouth via Beer and Branscombe .

Since the closure of the Sidmouth Railway in 1967, the nearest railway stations are Feniton, Honiton or Whimple, all on the West of England line. Feniton is the nearest of these stations, being away.

==Government==
Sidmouth has its own town council, presided over by a chair elected from councillors. There are eight wards, with 19 councillors in all. The town clerk is the senior paid officer, with a team of full-time and part-time staff. The town is responsible for many of the locally run services, including the information centre. Sidmouth lies within the areas of East Devon District Council and Devon County Council. The electorate of the Sidmouth ward at the 2011 census was 13,737.

Sidmouth was in the Honiton parliamentary constituency from its recreation in 1885 until its abolition in 1997, and the East Devon constituency from its recreation in 1997 until its abolition, since when it has been in the Honiton and Sidmouth.

==Culture==


===Churches and museums===
The parish church is dedicated to St Giles and St Nicholas. It was rebuilt in 1860; the architect was William White. Of the medieval structure, only the 15th-century tower has been retained. Oddments of Norman and later stonework were included in the rebuilding. Features of interest include the Duke of Kent Memorial Window, which Queen Victoria gave in 1867, and the reredos by Samuel Sanders Teulon. Parts of the original fabric, such as the windows, were reused by the historian Peter Orlando Hutchinson in building a folly adjoining his house. He was also responsible for saving the stained glass in the vestry. The folly is the Old Chancel in Coburg Terrace which was started by Hutchinson in 1859, in protest over the destruction of the original church fabric during rebuilding.

The museum, next to the church, has local memorabilia, historical artefacts, and geological samples.

The church of All Saints, also Anglican (Taylor, architect, 1837), is in the Early English style with lancet windows and &quot;oddly clumsy&quot; pinnacles. There were also Unitarian, Wesleyan (later Methodist) and Congregational chapels; the Unitarian chapel was founded in the 17th century by Presbyterians and the Wesleyan and Congregational ones in 1837 and 1846 respectively.

After the Reformation, the Catholic Church returned to Sidmouth in 1880 with the arrival of exiled French Jesuits who were joined in 1881 by the Sisters of the Assumption. The convent erected a purpose built chapel which opened for public mass in 1884. By the 1920s the Catholic population had grown to require a parish church. Land at Radway was acquired in 1930 and the Church of the Most Precious Blood was built, with the first Mass being celebrated on 10 November 1935.

Sidmouth is home to the Norman Lockyer Observatory and Planetarium, located on Salcombe Hill. The facility, completed in 1912, fell into disuse but was saved from demolition by the appeals of enthusiasts to East Devon District Council. The observatory now operates as a science education project and is open to the public.

===Music===

====Folk Week====

Sidmouth Folk Week is an annual folk festival in early August attracting musicians and visitors. It became less financially viable over the years and in 2005 the last of the commercial sponsors, essential for its existence, pulled out. To continue the tradition, individuals grouped together to form Sidmouth FolkWeek Productions, a limited company. Since the change of format, the event has been held on a smaller scale, with no arena at the Knowle, though marquees are still erected in the Blackmore Gardens and The Ham at the eastern end of the town. The popular late-night extra feature is also run at Bulverton on the edge of Sidmouth next to the main campsite.

====Sidmouth Town Band====
During the summer, Sidmouth Town Band, a brass band, play a series of concerts in the Connaught Gardens each Sunday at 8pm from late May until early September. The earliest record of the band is from a photograph of 1862.

In 2010, during competition, it was crowned West of England Champion in the third section. It went on to win third prize at the national finals of Great Britain. In 2011, it retained its West of England Champion title, becoming one of only a handful of bands to win back-to-back titles, and was promoted to the second section from 2012. From 2017 the band was promoted to the First Section.

===Literary associations ===
Sidmouth has featured in various literary works, e.g. as &quot;Stymouth&quot; in Beatrix Potter&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;The Tale of Little Pig Robinson&quot; (1930), in which the author included views of the beach and other parts of the Devon countryside. In Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Wessex&quot; it is the inspiration for &quot;Idmouth&quot;. &quot;Baymouth&quot; in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Pendennis&quot;, and &quot;Spudmouth&quot; in &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; by Howard Pyle, are both based on the town. In G. A. Henty&#x27;s book &quot;With Wolfe in Canada&quot;, the hero James Walsham is from Sidmouth, and parts at the beginning and end of the book take place there. The poet Elizabeth Barrett lived in the town from 1832 until 1835. The area of rock pools around Jacob&#x27;s Ladder is used as the location for H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Sea Raiders&quot;. In 1962, author R. F. Delderfield had a house, &#x27;Dove Cottage&#x27; (now &#x27;Gazebo&#x27;), built on Peak Hill.

J.R.R. Tolkien was a regular visitor to Sidmouth and wrote parts of the early part of Lord of the Rings while on holiday with his family in 1938. Chapters drafted during the holiday encompass the hobbits escape of the Shire through the Old Forest and up to their arrival at Bree.

It was a favourite spot for Sir John Betjeman. He chose it as the subject of the first programme of the television series &quot;John Betjeman in the West Country&quot; that he wrote and presented in 1962. The script takes the form of an extended poem and was republished in 2000 as a short book.

Sidmouth has been the setting for television dramas, such as a 1987 adaptation of William Trevor&#x27;s novel &quot;The Children of Dynmouth&quot;, and an ITV adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Marple&quot; in summer 2005.

===Miscellaneous===
The &quot;Sidmouth Herald&quot; is the local newspaper.

Manor Pavilion houses an arts centre and a theatre that hosts both amateur and professional productions. There is also the Radway Cinema.

Sidmouth has been a frequent winner of Britain in Bloom awards. Most recently it won the Small Town category in 2001 and the Coastal Resort category in 2005.

The Sid Vale Association, the first civic society in Britain, was founded in 1846 and is based in Sidmouth.

In 2016, a worldwide architectural competition was held in the town to provide ideas for the future redevelopment of Sidmouth&#x27;s eastern town and seafront. The competition was initiated by Sidmouth Architect Henry Beech Mole.

In October 2018, it was discovered that an unusually large fatberg was constricting the sewers. A team of scientists from the University of Exeter studied it and attributed it to the ageing population and its food habits. It was removed and turned into energy at a local power plant.

===Twin towns===
Sidmouth is twinned with Le Locle in Switzerland.

==Features==
The Esplanade is the sea front road from the red cliffs of Salcombe Hill in the east towards Jacob&#x27;s Ladder Beach at the west. Peak Hill can be seen in the distance.

Jacob&#x27;s Ladder is a series of wooden steps leading up to Connaught Gardens from Jacob&#x27;s Ladder Beach and its red cliffs.
Connaught Gardens date from around 1820. They were named after the Duke of Connaught, the third son of Queen Victoria, who officially opened the gardens in 1934. The bandstand there is used by bands in many weeks of the summer season.

This grassy slope up and along Peak Hill follows the red cliffs above Jacob&#x27;s Ladder Beach. It provides a wide view eastwards over the whole town towards Salcombe Hill.

==Economy==
The principal revenue is from tourism, with a wide range of hotels and guest houses, as well as self catering accommodation in the local area. Sidmouth is a retirement location, so pensioner spending is another source of income.

The largest employer is East Devon District Council, the headquarters of which are at the former Knowle Hotel. The headquarters were transferred to Honiton in 2019. There is a large independent department store, Fields of Sidmouth, which has been on the same site for over 200 years. There are pubs, restaurants, coffee houses and tea rooms; also an indoor swimming pool, a sports hall at the leisure centre, and a golf course.

==Education==

Sidmouth College is a comprehensive school which takes children aged between 11 and 18 from as far afield as Exmouth and Exeter. In February 2012, with 852 pupils on the roll, the college was deemed &#x27;Good&#x27; by Ofsted. The judgment of improvement in the college&#x27;s provision followed the previous inspection (May 2009) when it was deemed &#x27;satisfactory&#x27;. In the 2005 Ofsted report, when there were 869 students on the roll, it was also deemed &#x27;satisfactory&#x27;.

Sidmouth College is situated in the Sid Valley. It admits students from East Devon.

There is one state junior school, which takes children from between the ages of 8 and 11. There are two state infant schools. There is, additionally, a private school: St John&#x27;s International School (formerly known as the Convent of the Assumption) which takes children from two to 18, including overseas boarders. In 2007, it was taken over by International Education Systems (IES).

Sidmouth International School is an English language school for foreign pupils.

<text>Prithvi Narayan Shah (; 7 January 1723 – 11 January 1775), was the last king of the Gorkha Kingdom and first king of the Kingdom of Nepal (also called the &quot;Kingdom of Gorkha&quot;). Prithvi Narayan Shah started the unification of Nepal. He is also credited for moving the royal seat of power to Kathmandu. 

== Early years ==

Prithvi Narayan Shah was born prematurely on 7 January 1723 as the first child of Nara Bhupal Shah and Kaushalyavati Devi in the Gorkha Palace.
Prince Prithvi Narayan Shah&#x27;s education began at age five through the appropriate ceremony. At that time, the responsibility to educate him was given to Mokchyeshwor Aryal and Bhanu Aryal. They were the &quot;Upadhyayas&quot; who worked in the palace as astrologers, where they were also known as &quot;Jyotishi&quot; or &quot;Jaisi&quot;&quot;.&quot; Even though the Gurus provided his primary education, the duty of developing his character was taken on by Queen Chandra Pravawati. It is said that seeing the princes of neighboring states Tanahun, Lamjung, and Kaski indulge in excess pleasure, Chandra Pravawati kept Prithvi Narayan Shah away from pleasurable or wrong pursuits. That is why no traces of pleasurable pursuits and diversion can be found in his early life. Narbhupal Shah wanted P.N. Shah to marry a strong family so that it would assist him if needed. The best prospect of marriage that he saw fit was with the Kingdom of Makwanpur. P.N. Shah had turned 14 in 1737 C.E. and it was decided that he would marry Indrakumari, the daughter of Hemkarna Sen, the Princess of Makwanpur in the Pre-Unification Nepal.

From a young age, he took an interest in the affairs of his father&#x27;s state and soon began to take on these responsibilities. Prithvi Narayan Shah had an early dream of conquering Nuwakot, partially because his father had lost it to the Mallas of Kathmandu in an earlier war. After the death of his father in 1743 AD, Prithvi Narayan Shah ascended to the throne of Gorkha at the age of 20. As king, he valued his people and enjoyed talking to them about their general concerns. This practice helped him to build a rapport with his people and helped him to understand the requirements of the citizens of Gorkha. King Shah sealed his borders and maintained a friendly diplomatic relationship with his neighbors, with the exception of the East India Company, which ignored Nepal and refused to open trade relations at the time.

== Reign and military career ==
Before Prithvi Narayan Shah&#x27;s unification movement, there were a total of 54 states in Nepal. The 54 states were named as Baisi Rajya and Chaubise Rajya. In the South-Eastern Terai, there were three Sen states: Makawanpur, Bijayapur, and Chaudandi. In the West, from Gorkha to Gandaki Province, there were 24 states. In the province of Karnali, there were 22 states with Kalyan, Samaal, Shahi and Chand dynasties. Along with Gorkha and Mustang, Bhaktapur, Kantipur and Lalitpur made up the remaining five states. When Prithvi Narayan Shah ascended to the throne of Gorkha on 3 April 1743 A.D., it was still a small state. He then started to contemplate the methods for turning Gorkha into a huge and strong state. He went to Varanasi to gain first-hand knowledge about the neighbouring states and about India to the south. During those days, Varanasi was one of the largest trade centres in India where people from different places gathered. He met with different types of people and gained valuable understandings regarding the Political and Social conditions of the Indian Sub-Continent. In Varanasi, his father-in-law Abhiman Singh, a Thakuri Chief, procured for him some firearms and a quantity of ammunition.

=== Nuwakot ===

His first attempt at invasion of Nuwakot in 1743 CE failed and his reign began with an immediate military defeat. Conquering Nuwakot was essential for the unification, as it lay between Kathmandu and the Gorkha District, making it a vital trading route to Tibet.

On his return to Gorkha from Varanasi, Prithvi Narayan Shah first took steps to defeat Nuwakot in the diplomatic field. He entered into friendly alliance with the chiefs of Lamjung, Tanahun and Palpa. This done, Prithvi Narayan Shah sent an army against Nuwakot from three directions. The Chief of Nuwakot Kaji Jayanta Rana Magar (former Kaji of Gorkha) knowing that Gorkha is going to attack them in near future had gone to take help from Jaya Prakash Malla, the king of Kantipur. Thus Kaji Jayant Rana Magar son Commander of Nuwakot Sankha Mani Rana Magar commanded the Nuwakot army representing his father. The Nuwakot army was defeated in 1744 CE and his country passed into the hands of Prithvi Narayan Shah&#x27;s Gorkhas.

=== Kirtipur ===

Prithvi Narayan Shah&#x27;s next strategy was to conquer all the places around the Nepal valley, that is, Kathmandu and the neighboring regions, and thereby to create an economic crisis in order that the conquest of Nepal valley might become easier. He first attacked Kirtipur, a dependency of Patan and a strategic post commanding the Nepal valley, but was signally defeated (1757). He made a narrow escape from the battlefield but his minister Kalu Pande was killed. Pande&#x27;s death meant a great loss to the Gorkhas and it was not until 1763 that they were in a position to resume the policy of conquest.

In 1765, Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked Kirtipur again after two humiliating defeats. In Kirtipur, King Prithvi Narayan conquered the ancient city on his third attempt. The ferocity with which the conquerors had dealt with the natives of Kirtipur struck terror into the hearts of the neighbouring people and made the conquest easier and they won.

=== Makwanpur===

In 1763, the Gorkhas conquered Makwanpur, one of the gateways to Nepal from Bengal. The conquest of Makwanpur, however, brought Prithvi Narayan Shah in a collision with Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal. Bikram Sen, the king of Makwanpur, was then taken prisoner by Prithvi Narayan Shah. Upon this Kanak Singh, another local Chief complained to Nawab Mir Qasim and requested his intervention. &quot;In consequence of this complaint, the Nabab himself crossed over sending Gurgin Khan before him who arrived near Makwanpur where his whole army being destroyed the Nabab returned to Patna&quot;. The expedition of Qasim was also determined by Gurgin Khan&#x27;s eagerness to test the strength and skill of the troops who he had disciplined and of the artillery which he had trained. Gurgin Khan&#x27;s lust for the Nepalese gold was another cause of his earnestness to lead the expedition, although the Nawab had counselled against it. Gurgin Khan lost a great number of his men and had to leave many stands of arms.

=== Chaukot ===
The Gorkhalis fought for six months with the people of Dhulikhel. After this Prithvi Narayan Shah built a fort on the top of the hill south of Chaukot and collected a large number of troops. On consulting with his followers, he was told by the kajis that small villages were easily taken, as the people fled when they heard the shouts of the assailants, but the village of Chaukot required special military skills. After this, consultation the troops blockaded Chaukot. Some of the people fled to Pyuthan by way of Basdol, and others to their places. Narasinha Rai went to Mahindra Sinha Rai and said, &quot;We are unable to cope with the Gorkhalis with the help of fifty houses. The rest of the people have fled, and I have come to tell you. Do not delay but flee soon&quot;. Mahindra Sinha reproached him and charged him with cowardice, saying, &quot;Do not stay for me but escape with your lives. As for myself, I will repulse the whole force of the Gorkhalis, and having earned great renown, will enjoy my possession in happiness. If I do not succeed, I shall leave my body on the field of battle and earn an abode in heaven, by the merit of which my sons and grandsons will obtain happiness.&quot; Then he called together his faithful followers, who were desirous of securing happiness in the next world and encouraged them.

On the 6th of Jestha (28 May 1757), a severe battle was fought, which lasted from evening till 12 &quot;gharis (12 o&#x27; clock)&quot; of the night. The Gorkhalis, having lost 131 men, retreated. The battle was renewed daily for fifteen days, without the Gorkhalis making any impression. On the 6th of Jeth Sudi a hardly contested battle was fought, which lasted till 14 &quot;gharis&quot; of the night. At this time a soldier, getting behind Mahindra Sinha, killed him with a &quot;khoda&quot; and a lance and wounded Narasinha in the left shoulder with a Khukuri, due to which he fell senseless to the ground. Seeing this, the Chaukotiyas fled, and the village was set on fire. In this battle, the Gorkhalis lost 201 men, which, with the 131 killed on the former day, gives the total of 332 men.

The next morning Prithvi Narayan Shah inspected the field of battle, and seeing Mahindra Sinha Rai&#x27;s lifeless body pierced with wounds, he praised his bravery and sent for his family, that they being the relative of so brave a man, might have proper protection. They were brought and fed in the royal kitchen. After this, having with ease taken five villages, viz., Panauti, Banepa, Nala, Khadpu, and Sanga, Prithvi Narayan Shah returned to Nuwakot.

=== Kathmandu Valley ===
After this, he intended to take possession of the Kathmandu Valley. Prithvi Narayan Shah&#x27;s conquest of the whole of Nepal was rendered easier by the internal dissensions among the Nepali rulers. Ranjit Malla, the chief of Bhadgaon, invoked the assistance of the Gorkha Chief due to his feud with the chiefs of Patan and Kathmandu. Prithvi Narayan Shah had previously gained over the &quot;Satbahalyas&quot; of Ranjit Malla by promising to leave them the throne and the revenue to content himself with nominal sovereignty over the country.

Prithvi Narayan Shah took possession of Bhadgaon and next he invested in Patan in 1767. The rapid expansion of the Gorkha dominions and the growth of the Gorkha power round the Nepal valley placed Jaya Prakash Malla, the Chief of Kathmandu in a state of siege. All egress and ingress having been stopped, Kathmandu faced the danger of being starved into submission. The valley was completely cut off from the outside world and was controlled solely by Shah. Having understood that the Gorkhas cannot be defeated by his army alone, Jaya Prakash in this predicament sought military assistance from the Bengal Presidency by sending one of his messengers to Patna in order to ask for help with the East India Company. The officers in Patna of the East India Company sent the message to Bengal. The East India Company seized the opportunity and sent a warning to Prithvi Narayan Shah and decided to send an expedition to relieve Jaya Prakash.

According to legends, when Prithvi Narayan Shah entered the durbar of Bhadgaon, he found the kings of three towns sitting together, whereat he and his companions laughed. Jaya Prakash was offended by this, and said, &quot;O Gorkhalis, this has come to pass through the treachery of our servants, or else you would have had no cause for mirth.&quot; Prithvi Narayan Shah having conversed with Jaya Prakash Malla for a while then paid his respects to Ranjit Malla, and respectfully asked him to continue to rule as he had hitherto done, although Prithvi Narayan Shah had conquered the country. Ranjit Malla said that Prithvi Narayan Shah had obtained the sovereignty by the favor of God and that all that he now asked for was to be sent to Benaras. Shah entreated him to remain, but the recollection of the treachery of the servants was fresh in his memory and he would not be consent. Shah granted him the leave along with the expenses used for the journey. When Ranjit Malla reached the top of the Chandragiri Paa, he took a last view of Nepal, and with tears in his eyes exclaimed, &quot; The &quot;Satbahalyas&quot; have killed my son Bir Narsinha, and have caused me this sorrow. &quot; He then bade farewell to Taleju, Pashupatinath, and Guhyeshwari, and went to seek an asylum with Bisweswaranatha and Ganga.

He also occupied the Kuti Pass in circa 1756 CE, halting all trade through the pass and preventing communication with Tibet.

== Kinloch expedition ==
After the loss, Jaya Prakash Malla, out of sheer desperation, sent Nepali &quot;Vakeels&quot; to Mr. Golding, the Commercial Agent of the East India Company at Bettiah, to solicit their help against Prithvi Narayan Shah. The purport of the conversation between the Nepali &quot;Vakeels&quot; and Golding was communicated to Thomas Rumbold, the company&#x27;s chief at Patna, on 6 April 1767. Golding had made a strong case for sending an expedition to the relief of Jaya Prakash Malla. According to him, if Malla was successfully relieved, the East India Company would earn his gratitude which would facilitate the opening of communication with Tibet through Nepal and this would be of great consequence to the company. Malla was offering to bear all costs of the expedition.

In the meantime, Prithvi Narayan Shah had already realized the danger of a military alliance between Malla and the East India Company. Shah then sent a letter to Rumbold requesting his protection for a visit to Patna. Rumbold then communicated Shah&#x27;s request to the president of the Select Committee. The Select Committee under the persuasion of Golding decided to instead send military assistance to Jaya Prakash Malla.

The Select Committee directed George Kinloch, who had been earlier sending on an expedition against the Raja of Tipperah, to proceed to Patna so that he might be in readiness to lead the expedition against Prithvi Narayan Shah. The considerations that weighted with the Selection Committee to decide in favour of sending military assistance to Jaya Prakash Malla can be gathered from their letters. The revival of the declining, almost dead, trade relations with Nepal and the opening up of Tibet trade through Nepali territory were two of the prime considerations. Under instructions from the Select Committee Capt. Kinloch proceeded to Patna where he was asked to await further instructions from Mr. Rumbold. Pursuant to the committee&#x27;s decision to render the military assistance, Mr Rumbold and Capt. Kinloch was busy gathering all relevant information that was likely to help the expedition to success. In the meantime, Prithvi Narayan Shah was peremptorily asked to accept the East India Company mediation to which he sent an evasive reply.

In June 1767, The Nepali &quot;Vakeels&quot; Muktananda and Faqir Ramdoss who came to solicit East India Company help on behalf of Jaya Prakash Malla were examined by Capt. Kinloch at Patna with a view to eliciting every information of military importance. The strength of Prithvi Narayan Shah&#x27;s troops, as the &quot;Vakeels&quot; said, was near about 50,000 of which again, only 20,000 were stationed in the Nepal valley and the rest was engaged in cultivation in their native places. Their arms comprised bows and arrows, swords and matchlocks. The &quot;Vakeels&quot; also made no secret of the fact that there was no time to lose, as the break of monsoon the hilly paths would become unsafe and the hill rivers unforeseeable. They also informed Capt. Kinloch how Prithvi Narayan Shah had &quot;taken ten principal cities and possession of all his (Jaya Prakash&#x27;s) country&quot; and had kept the towns of Kathmandu, Patan, Bhadgaun, and Zeemy (&quot;sic&quot;) all closely blockaded&quot;&quot;.&quot;

The total distance to be covered by the expeditionary force was 96 &quot;coss&quot; (384000 yards&quot;)&quot; and the journey had to be completed by eleven stages, during the last six stages of which the Nepal Rajah undertook to provide porters and provisions.

The expedition, however, miscarried and the high hopes of the Select Committee were dashed to the ground. The reasons for the failure were set forth in a series of letter that passed between Capt. Kinloch and Mr. Rumbold, the latter, the Select Committee and the Court of Directors. The first reason mentioned the destruction of the major part of their provisions by a sudden torrent from the hills. The other reason was that no help in respect to provisions came from the Nepal Rajah and when Capt. Kinloch had reached Janakpur assurances of abundant supply were given by the men of the Rajah once the troops would reach Sindhuli where the seventh stage of the journey would have ended. But even there, the promised help didn&#x27;t come. &quot;Famine stared them in the face. Retreat under the present circumstances was out of the question and it was impossible to hold Sindhuli for long as all supplies of provisions had been cut off by the enemy (Prithvi Narayan Shah). But as Kinloch insisted the troops had to face the holy river Bagmati. The troops had built an improvised bridge and rafts but the violent torrent washed them down before any army could cross the river. Famished and falling sick in an increasingly large number, the troops had no way out but to order an immediate retreat. The retreating troops, however, were hotly pursued by the Gorkhas sent by Prithvi Narayan Shah. Capt. Kinloch then, at last, returned to the Terai and occupied the territories of Bara, Parsa and Hilwall. The miscarriage of the Kinloch expedition allowed Prithvi Narayan Shah to deal with the besieged capitals of Kathmandu, Patan, Bhadgaon, etc. By the end of the year 1768, he had succeeded in reducing all the cities that still held out. &quot;Prithvi Narayan Shah almost walked into Kathmandu due to the Indra Jatra revelry in which the Nepali were sunk&quot;.

== Divyopadesh ==
Towards the end of his life, Prithvi Narayan Shah was troubled by illness to a great extent. He had probably started to realize his end was near, which is why he decided to organize an unofficial council meeting known as &quot;bhardaari-sabha.&quot; In this &quot;sabha&quot; he decided to inform his brothers, his son and his ministers on why was he involved in the unification of Nepal and what should the appropriate policies and programs for the future be regarding Nepal. This &quot;sabha&quot; continued for the whole day for about 5/6 hours. The messages he gave in this &quot;sabha&quot; was written down by his brothers and ministers and was compiled as Divyopadesh.

== Foreign policy ==

Prithvi Narayan Shah considered the state of Nepal as a &#x27;Yam between two boulders &#x27;, referring to Tibet on the North and the &#x27;Emperor of Seas&#x27; to the South. He suggested that Nepal should forever maintain a good friendship with Tibet. In regards to his policy towards the East India Company&#x27;s rule, however, he suggested maintaining friendliness but also to be wary of their shrewdness. Shah opined that &quot;The East India Company is currently occupying Hindustan forcefully...If the Hindustanis wake-up then they will come here in search of safe forts&quot;. Hence, Prithvi Narayan Shah connoted his soldiers to be prepared and build barriers and forts at appropriate locations. 4. The Counsel
King Prithvi Narayan Shah is believed to have fallen sick in the last week of December 1774. Then he summoned everybody to his palace in Nuwakot and gave his Counsel in order to safeguard the nation for future generations. He died on the morning of 11 January 1775. This Counsel was believed to have been given by him to his courtiers and people at a palace named “Rangmahal” which was built in 1766 in the plains of Taadi river in Nuwakot.22 His Counsel to courtiers, future leaders, and citizens of Nepal is found in the following pages.

 King Prithvi Narayan Shah’s Counsel (Upadesh)
(1)
Shree Ganesh, I pray to you. Please help us Shree Kalika. Please help us Shree 3 Shiva Gorakhnath. Now I start writing about Shree 5 Prithvi Narayan Shah. Shree Shree Shree 5 Old Maharaja, after the victory of three cities of Nepal and states of Hindupati (Sen Kings of Makwanpur, Chaudandi and Bijayapur), addressed Priests (Gurupurohit), six castes of people (tharghar) who helped secure the Kingdom of Dravya Shah in Gorkha, the first king of Gorkha Shah dynasty, brothers, courtiers, his Magar Dada Surathi Singh Rana Magar and all elderly
who gathered in Nuwakot.
(2)
They say after old people die, their saying (sharing of experience) goes to the next generation.
If I will tell all of you, you will tell your descendants and your descendants will tell our de- scendants, thus this state will be saved and ruled (in future).
(3)
Our mothers were three. We were the incarnation of Pancha Pandava (five brothers, sons of
Kunti and Madri in Mahabharata epic) from three different Chambers. (4)
My marriage was held in Makwanpur. But my bride (dola) was not handed over to me so I visited Makwanpur and in the meantime also wanted to see Nepal. There I told Digbandhan Sen by strongly persuading him-“if you give me ek danta Elephant (having one tooth only-a symbol of good omen) and Naulakha Haar (expensive necklace made of diamond and other jewels), I will take my bride”. (Otherwise...) I threatened him saying that I will take her by force by fighting with the sword. After that, I left (Makwanpur).
(5)
So that Nepal King would not recognise and arrest me, I wore a Syakhu (local thick woollen
cloth worn covering head and back, generally put on by farmers and porters), I walked with Bhanu Jaisi (Aryal, Astrologer), Kulananda Jaisi (Dhakal, Astrologer), and other Tharghar along the banks of the river Rapti. After we arrived at Chandragiri, I asked them which one was Nepal and they showed me pointing to Patan, Bhaktapur and Kathmandu. In my mind, I was thinking that it would be excellent if I become the king of all three cities. At exactly the same time, both Jaisis said that Maharaj’s wishes would be fulfilled. I was surprised and asked them how did they know about my wishes in my mind. They replied that while You were watching at Nepal (Three cities of the valley), You put your hand at your mustache. Then we thought that You had a wish to become the King of Nepal and we said so. When I further asked whether these wishes would be fulfilled, they stated that as You have high respects for Cows, Brahmins, Guests, Fakirs (Yogis), and Gods and Goddesses, and we have blessings of Saraswoti (Goddess of Learning) on our hands, You would surely get the states of Nepal.
(6)
We walked through the big Pass of Thangkot and reached Dhading by crossing Kahlarighat
trekking day and night.
(7)
I asked Jaisi to write an order (Rukka) to my three brave men, who were stationed in (Gautan
ko Birhauto: new settlement at Gautan, northwest of Gorkha) Liglig Fort (Aadh) at the side Hill (Khawa) of Chepe (river). He asked their names. And I gave him their names: Ranajit Basnyat, Man Singh Rokaha and Birbhadra Pathak. I wrote them to come to Maidhi as soon as possible and they arrived. I consulted with them in private and told them that I had threat- ened Digbandhan Sen and I saw Nepal. I keep my inner desire to attack (Nepal), what do you

 say ? They suggested “go ahead and attack Maharaj”. I further asked them “when I go for attacking others, if at the same time, some others might attack on us (Gorkha), then what will happen ?” They replied to me that these Baisi Chaubisi are just frightening you (as if you are like an elephant) and assured me that they (from Gorkha side) would fight shedding the river of blood in Chepe against them, if they come (for attack). And we stood up from the secret meeting and left for Gorkha.
(8)
After we arrived, my maternal uncle (Crown Prince Udyot Sen, son of King Gandharva Sen
of Palpa) who had gone to have a darshan (pilgrimage, seeing the image of deity) of Nilakan- tha (Gosaikunda) and Pashupati via Devghat, came to Gorkha for the darshan of Gorakhnath, where we met after his darshan.
(9)
I said “ Uncle, I had gone to Makwanpur and (on the way back) I saw Nepal, I have earnest
desire to attack (Nepal), please tell me how my mission would be accomplished ? Give me your good counsel ?” He gave me his advice in the Pancharatra. He said “When we see, we think that there is an incarnation of Pancha Pandava (Five brothers including Prithvi Narayan Shah), Nepal can not be captured without any Kuruchhetra (place of decisive battle between Kauravas and Pandavas in Mahabharat), Lamjung is a ‘Garud’, Gorkha is a ‘Snake’ and Nepal is a ‘Frog’. So first we have to deceive ‘Garud’ to eat the ‘Frog’.” I said “ I have four castes of soldiers, on whom I should trust the most to mount an attack to get quick suc- cess ?” He asked “which are the castes ? I told him- Bahun, Khas, Magar and Thakuri”. He replied “ Bahun is like a bull, so it is a sin to send Bahun, Thakuri is like a Lion, later there will be a betrayal, Magar is like a Tagan Horse, it will be slow, Khas is like a Tazi Turki Horse, so it is better to depend on Khas for faster success”. He gave other important advice before he left which I took into consideration.
(10)
I went to see King of Lamjung Ripumardan Shah. We met at Chepe Ghat. We talked about
peace. The key points which I had in mind from which there would be a peace agreement, ex- actly the same points were conveyed by Kalu Pandey. Thus the strong agreement was possible and established. I was surprised, and thought that he made me happy, but in the sacred car- dinal documents of Hinduism also, it is written that the Kazi post should be given to the per- son with whom general public are happy. I consulted with the public and found that they liked Kalu Pandey. They advised me if you give Kazi post to him, we feel protected. I also checked in Baisi Chaubisi about him and found that they liked him. Even though I wished to give the post of Kazi to Biraj Bakheti, I awarded this post to Kalu Pandey because he was considered to be wiser.
(11)
Then I thought I will make a bond between Pandey and Basnyat, I asked Kalu Pandey to give
his daughter’s hand for marriage to Kehar Singh Basnyat, son of Shivaram (Singh) Basnyat. Thus through this family bond, I mounted an attack on Nepal (three city-states of Kathmandu Valley) and won it by the shields of Pandeys and swords of Basnyats.
(12)
I assigned Ranajit Basnyat, Man Singh Rokaha and Birbhadra Pathak in Gautanko Birhauto
at Liglig Aadh and told them that I will come to Salyankot Devi for darshan on an auspicious day as the deity is believed to be giving blessings to the devotees (which becomes true in real life). I also reached there. We established Tharpu (temporary camp) in the barren land. I asked with Tharghar and Baraha-Umraos of Salyani whether I can have the darshan of the

 Goddess. They said that only the Priest and the Guard can go inside the temple. Then I asked “Can I go only up to the door of the temple ? They said “yes, you can go.”
(13)
Every morning and evening, I used to go to the door for darshan and worship at the temple
reciting religious texts and mantras. One night I had a dream. I saw one seven-eight year old girl with Khadga (curved swords) in her both hands coming near me. Her face was partly cov- ered by a shawl. I asked her“ Who is your father ? She replied “ I am the daughter of Priest Rana (Magar)”. And she gave me both the swords. Something was shining which she took out from her bosom. She gave me something to swallow near my mouth and said “I have fulfilled your wishes, so you should also give something for me”. As she was leaving taking two steps forward, I was awake from the dream. I called Bhanu Jaisi, Kulananda Jaisi and Priest Rana Magar, and asked about the dream. They said that she was the Goddess and You had a darshan of her. I immediately arranged for incense, lamp, prayer cloth, and fruits and sweets for the daily worship. I also managed and dedicated seven male buffalos and seven male goats for sacrifice for a special worship and presented some lands near Borlang Ghat and the Ghat’s all income to the Goddess. And I left on the same auspicious moment.
(14)
Marching day and night, I arrived and established a temporary camp in Simalchaur Square.
My intention was (to capture) Nuwakot but I pretended to remain in Khinchet for making canal for agricultural lands. I used to go to the temple of Beni Indrayani at Betravati crossing the river by boat for reciting religious texts. I used to meditate and concentrate my mind on Devi (Goddesses) of Salyankot, Indrayani and Bhairavi.
(15)
Mahamandal is like a rival wife of Nuwakot. In Mahamandal, there was a Gyami (Jayant Rana Magar). I sent him a message saying that you were our own man, leave Mahamandal and come to join me. He retorted “I was your own man but I had eaten the salt of Jaya Prakash Malla, so I would fight till death”.
(16)
One day I was sitting in the Council and I had a nap. I was actually daydreaming and I saw
that I was at the temple of Indrayani. I overheard a voice saying that there was an auspicious moment for attack on Nuwakot after one week and Nuwakot can be conquered. I immediately asked astrologer to see the calendar. He told me that there was one big auspicious moment in the early morning of Saturday after one week.
(17)
At the same given auspicious moment we climbed up to Nuwakot and the battle broke out.
(Bali) Panth, who was our staunch fighter and my brother Dalmardan Shah at the age of twelve only, made a decisive stroke of the sword (Jethi Tarwar) on the head of (Shankhamani) Rana Magar (Chief of Nuwakot). And we were victorious over Nuwakot and we celebrated this victo- ry.
(18)
We had established security posts (Thanas) at Kakani and Shivapuri as battlefront.
(19)
Parshuram Thapa was requesting me to come to attack Nepal assuring his support. (But...) in
the mean time he had sent his brother to Baisi Chaubisi with financial support (a sum of one hundred twenty thousand rupees) to incite them to attack us from rear and I came to know

 this. I asked “where his brother has reached ?” They told me that he had reached Hatiya in Pokhara. I further enquired as to who could go there and kill him ? Nobody could answer me, and I called Jhagal Gurung and asked him to go. I gave him my own Khukri and sent him. He reached there pretending to be a local folk singer carrying a sarangi (local musical instrument like a violin) under the arm, 2/4 dharnies (1 Dharni=2.39 kg) of sahar (a type of freshwater fish) and a fishing rod. While soldiers of his (Parshuram’s) brother were eating, he took a chance and killed him, and came back. Later I cleared the rear (western frontier of Gorkha), opened Nepal (Kathmandu valley kingdoms) and conquered it by taking into confidence the people of the east and the west.
(20)
This State is like a yam between two rocks. Establish enduring peace with Emperor of China.
Establish peace with the Emperor from south-sea (East India Company, King of England) but he is very shrewd. He is controlling Hindushthana (India) and he has taken our territory in the plains which is at our border. If Hindusthana (India) will unite, they (East India Compa- ny) will be in difficulty and they will come searching for forts. Establish forts based on the prevailing situations in the potential routes and put obstacles and hurdles in them. One day that force will come. Do not go to attack them but only if they attack, start the war and many of them will be slain at the Chure Pass. We can also seize the treasure-trove of weaponry which can be used by our five to seven generations. Border will be fixed up to Ganga (Ganges) river. If they can not win the war, they will come through persuasion or using so many tactics and deceptions (against us).
(21)
These forts are like the throne of Nepal. If one can secure these forts, all four Emperors can be
won. God has created these forts. There is no need to repair. Shivapuri-1, Phoolchoki-2, Chandragiri-3, Mahadevpokhari-4, Palung-5, Dapcha-6, Kahule-7. Make strong forts in these places. Keep canons in each Fort. Where there are Passes, keep one canon in each by making the iron gate and assign five soldiers in each place. After we do this, spies, rascals, murderers and the criminals who want to flee after committing crimes cannot do anything. If all the four emperors also come to attack, they can do nothing.
(22)
I already studied and examined the social norms made by King Ram Shah, King Jayasthiti
Malla and King Mahindra Malla. I had the wish to make such norms for twelve thousand (for Gorkha) if God permitted. I wanted to open the routes of Nepal by closing the routes of the east and the west. I wished to make rules for each race and caste to practice their own rituals freely.
(23)
These three cities are like cold rock. The big thing here is only intrigues. The people who
drink the water of wells do not have any wisdom. They are not also brave. Only conspiracies are common. My wish was to make a palace in Dahachowk including the houses of Priests, brothers, courtiers, mir umrao (chief officials of forts) in surrounding areas. And I wished to go to the three cities only for recreation purpose.
(24)
Do not give entry to the foreign merchants to climb above Godhparsa (Parsa Fort). If they
come to our country, they will make the people bankrupt. (25)
We won three cities of Nepal, nine lakh (nine hundred thousand) kirats and the state of Hindupati by wearing Chyanga Panga (garments made from coarse textile produced in the

 country). Ban the clothes made in foreign countries, teach our own people to weave by show- ing them the specimen and ask them to weave. Thus our money will not go to foreign coun- tries. Export our country’s products and medicinal herbs to foreign countries and earn mon- ey. Save money and if people become rich, palace (state) will also be strong. Resources of the country are its people.
(26)
Do not award contracts in the country. Government itself should give works (on the basis of
daily wages) under one office and keep accounts of each and every income and expenditure. Even if there are good soldiers and courtiers, stop them earning undue properties. Watch them closely and allow them to have properties only to maintain their conditions and posts. It is because the rich people can not have courage to fight with the swords and kill others and die in the battle. If not controlled, only bad people or enemy would shine (prevail). If soldiers, brothers and courtiers do not involve themselves in entertainments and recreational activities, my swords will prevail in all four directions. If not, there will be anarchy.
(27)
I conquered this country with no smaller hardships. Hence, it is a garden of all sorts (castes)
of people. Everyone should be aware of this. All people, big and small, of four races and thirty six castes of this garden (country) should maintain (and develop) this garden. This is a real land of the Hindus. Do not abandon your own religion (being practiced for generations).
(28)
Everybody should be loyal to the master (King) and work for him. Do not take away the post
of Kapardar (treasurer) from the descendants of Kalu (Khadka Magar) kapardar. Do not take away the responsibility of maintaining peace with the South (East India Company or India) from the descendants of Shivram (Singh) Basnyat. Do not take away the responsibility of maintaining peace with Tibet from the descendants of Kalu Pandey.
(29)
While extending compensation to Pandey, Basnyat, Pantha brothers and Magar, give them in
rotational basis. They are all my good loyal servants (of salt and of gratefulness). If they had committed any grave wrong-doing even to the extent of equivalence of death penalty, do not kill them but send them to war. If they survive, it is well and good, but if they die in the battle, you do not have to take the blame of their deaths because they were killed by others. King should not kill his people in his own house.
(30)
King should see that the justice is done. Do not give any space to injustice in the state. People
who give bribe and corrupt officials who take bribe are the big enemies of the king (state). There is no sin whatsoever if you confiscate their property and take even the life of these types of people.
(31)
The main thing is that King should give lands to the soldiers whose service is required to the
state. They will better manage and irrigate the land, and make some incomes from such activ- ities (both tiller and owner will get economic benefits). Their families will be free of economic burden. Thus soldiers will feel confident whether they are at the gate of the palace (near) or in the forts (far).
(32)
While making administrative appointments, arrange for a Company with hundred guns and
you should examine and appoint a Subedar of this Company who has been already a hero in

 four-five wars. Officials (Saatpagari-presently Jamdar or Junior Commanding Officers level) under this Subedar should be already 2/4 times tested people. These officials should also ap- point sixteen Havaldars who are ready to kill or die for their superior. Havaldars also should appoint soldiers who are ready to kill or die for the superior of their own groups.
(33)
In each group, appoint people from four castes namely Khas, Magar, Gurung and Thakuri. In
the battle this would be very strong. These are the only people who can hold the swords or weapons for battle. Thus we can even challenge the throne of Indra (king of heaven according to Hindu mythology), no matter any other enemy.
(34)
If we have with us thousands of bows, thousands of guns, thousands of curved swords and
thousands of canons, we can even win over Indra. (35)
In the wars, those who participate and those who attack and kill are equal. While giving job or lands, give them equally. If someone dies in the battle, his family should be given compen- sation till his son/sons are able to fight. After they are of the age to take swords, promote them to a job. If king has wisdom, best (fighters) soldiers would come to join us from other (foreign) states also, expecting a lot of good income.
(36)
Basic foundation of the king are soldiers and people. If the king is clever, he should keep them
in good humour. Thus there will be no law and order problem. Keep soldiers always on their toes (sharpening them through training). Such well-trained soldiers do not involve themselves in unwarranted activities and we will accomplish our mission.
(37)
Among Gurung, Magar, Khanzyada (royal family members), brothers, courtiers, Mir Umrao,
Tharghar, select veteran people to head the units in the palace and at the forts located far and wide. Do not give the entry to the Brahmin and Khas of the east and the west in the palace. Why ? Because they will bring about mismanagement in the palace (statecraft).
(38)
Keep all powers of the king to yourself. I had made three Baraha Umrao (Chiefs of hilltops or
forts) strong like the Vajra (firmness of spirit) of Indra. I had also given them big drums and Nishans (special religious military flag), and (budget of) 240 rupees to each. They used to go for battle whether it is in Salyan, Liglig or Dhading. And they were always victorious. Thus I had earned unimaginable property (for the state).
(39)
Keep your house always strong by selecting experienced and loyal people around you. If you
do this (check and balance), the palace (state) will be strong. If a King is clever, he should make soldiers and people happy, and keep them under his control. He should not believe in the false praise of some people but ask them to work on the basis of “salt eaten” (loyalty).
(40)
Operate the Mint (Coins) of the state also in a pure and clean manner. In the judicial Court (appoint Dittha)
select among the Thakuris and appoint the best one. Likewise, clark of the Court (appoint Bichari) from among the Magars. Operate the courts as per the principles of justice appointing one Pandit (judge) in each place.
(41)

 Do not use the income of Courts in the palace. Such income should be distributed or spent for foods for Fakirs, Beggars, Yogis, Sanyasis and Brahmins. Remaining amount should be spent as gifts of Dhoti (undergarment) and towels. Thus you will not be blamed for malpractice.
(42)
If mineral resources are discovered in the village, evacuate the people of the village and oper-
ate the Mines.
(43)
If a house is on the waterway in the terrace, move the house to another land and make the
canal (for irrigation).
(44)
Once they gave me hand to make peace. I was called by them but when I went there, they lat-
er betrayed me. I took a lot of hardships to clear the rear (Baisi Chaubisi) and was able to move ahead to capture Nepal.
(45)
(Armed) Naga soldiers were invited from the south to serve the interests of Jaya Parakash
Malla. I killed them in Saatgaun before they could enter Nepal (Kathmandu valley). (46)
Qasim Ali Khan attacked Makwanpur and I won them killing many by the strikes of 120 curved swords (Khunda), and by chasing their remaining soldiers across the border.
(47)
Handi Saheb attacked Sindhuli Gadhi with 3/4 Battalions and there also I killed many and
seized many guns from them.
(48)
Three muslims came from Lukhnow to Nuwakot to meet me and ask for jobs. These muslims knew how to operate the seized guns and I gave the post of Adjutants to all three namely Sheikh Zorabar, Memtaki and Bhekharsing. They trained the soldiers.
(49)
When I studied the book of Nepal (Chronicles), it was written that Nepal would be a Turkana,
Magarat and Muglana (territory of East India Company). It became already a Turkana. (Turk- ish invasion of Kathmandu Valley in 1347 AD by Bengal’s Turkish-origin Sultan Shamsuddin Ilias Shah). I myself is the King of Magarat. This has been also alright. But to save it from be- coming Muglana, I created (military) companies as that of Muglana by reducing the number of Thums (hill tops and forts) for austerity so as to pay for the half number of troops with guns and the other half with swords.
(50)
A company with hundred guns is swift and it is equivalent to one thousand soldiers. Keep one
company with guns each in every fort. Territories should be divided and delineated. Give sol- diers additional cereals and other expenses for tending the fort.
(51)
I have one serious doubt about Muglana which is very near from us. There are all sorts of
people like Chhokra (eunuchs) and Patriya (those women who do not have any shame). They play Drums (dholak), Sitar, Raag and Taan (Indian Classical music) in a room with fresco paintings. I am very much concerned that our youth might mingle with them and forget their duties. There is an obsession in Raagas and a lot of money is spent. They will take our secret information and our enemies might betray us. Nobody should practice Raagas. Do not open the route to the hills to these three types of people namely Chhokra, Patriya and Singers. (If you really want to see their performances), you can invite them during Faagu in a very few

number, one or two only and send them back immediately. Thus, they do not know our secrets also.
(52)
If you want to entertain yourselves, you can watch the traditional dance of Newars of the
three cities as per our religious texts (Shastra). If you give money to them, it will remain in our own country. Thus, our country can remain unchallengeable.
(From the book &quot;A Short Biography of King Prithvi Narayan Shaha and His Counsel to the People of Nepal&quot; by Dr. Niranjan Man Singh Basnyat, Kathmandu, 2021, pp. 69–85)

== Religion ==
Prithvi Narayan Shah was born into a Hindu family. After he became the master of Kathmandu proper, he began to follow his policy of exclusion and expulsion of the Europeans with all strictness. The Capuchin missionaries who were residing in Nepal for a long time and who had been successfully converting people and also gaining lands from the Malla Kings were expelled from Nepal. He called Nepal the actual &#x27;Hindustan.&#x27; He advised the citizens of Nepal to never leave the traditional dharma of the ancestors.

== Economic policy ==
Prithvi Narayan Shah strongly emphasized local production. In his Divya Upadesh, he was of the idea that if foreign traders enter Nepal then they will suck the country dry. In the same context, he suggested a boycott on wearing foreign clothes and also promotes the training of the local people to weave clothes. He believed that by doing so, the local wealth would not be allowed to reach out of the country. He encouraged the selling of Nepali herbs to foreign lands and bringing the wealth so attained back to the country. He also wanted the money to remain inside the country. He famously said, &quot; &quot;प्रजा मोटो भए दरबार पनि बलियो रहन्छ &quot;&quot; (If the people are capable then the palace will also remain stronger).

== Defense policy ==
King Prithvi Narayan Shah established the Nepal Army in August 1762 with Shreenath, Kali Baksh (Kalibox), Barda Bahadur, and Sabuj companies. Prithvi Narayan Shah emphasized the building of forts. He considered the land of Nepal as a natural fort created by God Himself. He suggested on building one strong fort each on Shivapuri, Phulchowki, Chandragiri, Mahadevpokhari, Palung, Daapcha, and Kaahule and placing cannon in each of them in a ready state. Construction of iron doors at the &quot;bhanjyangs&quot; and the placement of cannons in each of those doors, each in the ready state was also advocated by Prithvi Narayan Shah, which, he believed would keep the country safe from spies, refugees, murderers, etc.

== Memorial ==
Many structures, institutions and honors have been built in the memory of King Prithvinarayan Shah. Monuments erected in his name were renamed after the restoration of the parliament in 2063 BS and the end of the monarchy in 2065 BS. After the political changes of 2063 BS, an attempt was made to rename the highway built in the name of the king as Lok Marg.

==Death and legacy==
King Prithvi Narayaṇ Shah was ultimately able to capture small principalities and annex them into the kingdom. This expansion was crucial to ensure the continued survival of the Kingdom of Nepal as the East India Company was already expanding into the Indian subcontinent from their base in Bengal. Shah was convinced that the company would eventually conquer the regions bordering Nepal to the south and approach Nepal. He believed that if Nepal remained a collection of fifty principalities, then it would easily be defeated and conquered in the event of a war with the company or any other foreign power. Expanding his kingdom ensured that Nepal would remain an independent state and be able to negotiate with a foreign power on equal terms.

In January 1775, at the age of 52, Prithvi Narayan Shah died at Devighat, Nuwakot on his birthday. Upon his death, his son, Pratap Singh Shah, succeeded him and his unification campaign was continued by his younger son, Bahadur Shah.

<doc id="313143" wikidata="Q1997315" url="?curid=313143" title="Ishikari Subprefecture">
<text>is a subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, located in the western part of the island. The subprefecture covers and on July 31, 2023 had a population of 2,379,802. The subprefecture takes its name from the Ishikari River, the third longest in Japan, which flows through western Hokkaido and empties into the Sea of Japan in the city of Ishikari. There are 6 cities, three towns, and one village under its jurisdiction. Sapporo is both the capital of Hokkaido Prefecture and Ishikari Subprefecture. Shikotsu-Toya National Park is located in the southern part of the subprefecture, and Shokanbetsu-Teuri-Yagishiri Quasi-National Park in the north.

==Etymology==
The word Ishikari comes from the Ainu language, and several theories exist as to the meaning of the name.
*The most common translation of &quot;Ishikari&quot;, proposed by the missionary and researcher of the Ainu language John Batchelor (1854 – 1944) in 1935, is &quot;a greatly wandering river&quot;, a reference to the meandering path of the Ishikari River. According to Batchelor &quot;Ishikari&quot; is a corruption of &quot;i-sikar-pet&quot; or &quot;ishikaripet&quot;. The &#x27;i&#x27; sound of i-sikar-pet is a prefix meaning &quot;greatly&quot; or &quot;exceedingly&quot;; &quot;shikari&quot; meaning &quot;zigzag&quot; or &quot;serpentine&quot;, and &quot;pet&quot; is the Ainu word for river.
*Tōgo Yoshida (1864 – 1918), proposed in the &quot;Dai Nihon Chimei Jisho&quot;, published between 1907 and 1910, that &quot;Ishikaripet&quot; had its origin in the Ainu language word &quot;Ishikarapet&quot;, meaning &quot;a beautifully formed river&quot;; &quot;ishu&quot; meaning &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;kara&quot; meaning &quot;constructed&quot; and &quot;pet&quot; meaning river.

&quot;Ishikari&quot; is written in the Japanese language using &quot;ateji&quot;, or kanji characters used to phonetically represent native or borrowed words. The first, , means to &quot;stone&quot;, and the second, , means &quot;to hunt&quot;. The meaning of the written form of Ishikari has no relationship to the meaning of word in the Ainu language.

<text>Zapp Mobile was the first CDMA 450 MHz mobile phone operator in Romania, now part of Telekom Romania Mobile. In 2006 Zapp got a UMTS 2100 MHz license.

Zapp Mobile was a company of Telemobil S.A. România, which was a spin-off of Telefónica Romania, the first Romanian mobile service provider (now defunct). Telefónica Romania acquired a NMT license on 22 March 1992 and the mobile operator called &quot;Telemobil&quot; went live in April 1993.
On 30 June 2009 Zapp Mobile was acquired by OTE and it is in the process of integration in OTE&#x27;s Romanian mobile unit Cosmote Romania.

As of 24 March 2013 Zapp CDMA licence expired and the CDMA 450 network was closed down.

<doc id="313147" wikidata="Q464176" url="?curid=313147" title="American Expeditionary Forces">
<text>The American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was a formation of the United States Armed Forces on the Western Front during World War I, composed mostly of units from the U.S. Army. The AEF was established on July 5, 1917, in Chaumont, France under the command of then-Major General John J. Pershing. It fought alongside French Army, British Army, Canadian Army, British Indian Army, New Zealand Army and Australian Army units against the Imperial German Army. A small number of AEF troops also fought alongside Italian Army units in 1918 against the Austro-Hungarian Army. The AEF helped the French Army on the Western Front during the Aisne Offensive (at the Battle of Château-Thierry and Battle of Belleau Wood) in the summer of 1918, and fought its major actions in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in the latter part of 1918.

==Formation==
President Woodrow Wilson initially planned to give command of the AEF to Gen. Frederick Funston, but after Funston&#x27;s sudden death in February 1917, Wilson appointed Major General John J. Pershing in May, and Pershing remained in command for the rest of the war. Pershing insisted that American soldiers be well-trained before going to Europe. As a result, few troops arrived before January 1918. In addition, Pershing insisted that the American force would not be used merely to fill gaps in the French and British armies, and he resisted European efforts to have U.S. troops deployed as individual replacements in depleted Allied units. 
This approach was not always well received by the western Allied leaders who distrusted the potential of an army lacking experience in large-scale warfare. In addition, the British government tried to use its spare shipping as leverage to bring US soldiers under British operational control.
By June 1917, only 14,000 American soldiers had arrived in France, and the AEF had only a minor participation at the front up to late October 1917, but by May 1918 over one million American troops were stationed in France, with half of them fighting on the front lines. 
Since the transport ships needed to bring American troops to Europe were scarce at the beginning, the U.S. Army pressed into service passenger liners, seized German ships, and borrowed Allied ships to transport American soldiers from the Hoboken Port of Embarkation with facilities in New York City and New Jersey, and the Newport News Port of Embarkation in Virginia. The mobilization effort taxed the American military to the limit and required new organizational strategies and command structures to transport great numbers of troops and supplies quickly and efficiently. The French harbors of Bordeaux, La Pallice, Saint Nazaire, and Brest became the entry points into the French railway system that brought the American troops and their supplies to the Western Front. American engineers in France also built 82 new ship berths, nearly of additional standard-gauge tracks, and over of telephone and telegraph lines.

The first American troops, who were often called &quot;Doughboys,&quot; landed in Europe in June 1917. However the AEF did not participate at the front until October 23, 1917, when the 1st Division fired the first American shell of the war toward German lines, although they participated only on a small scale. A group of regular soldiers and the first American division to arrive in France, entered the trenches near Nancy, France, in Lorraine.
I Corps was officially activated in France, under the AEF, from 15 January 1918. It include the 1st, 2nd, 26th, 32nd, 41st and 42nd Divisions. (4th Brigade, US Marine Corps, was included as part of 2nd Division.) II Corps was activated on 24 February, by which time troop numbers justified it. Initially II Corps consisted of the 27th, 30th, 33rd, 78th and 80th Divisions.

In June 1918, many component infantry units from II Corps – commanded by Maj.-Gen. George W. Read – were attached to veteran British Army or Australian Army units. This served two purposes: familiarizing the Americans with actual battlefield conditions in France, and temporarily reinforcing the British Empire units that were often severely-depleted in numbers, after more than three years of fighting. In fact, the first major operation in World War I to involve US troops concerned individual infantry platoons of the 33rd Division, which were attached to battalions of the Australian Corps for the Battle of Hamel on the 4th of July. Their involvement was voluntary and occurred despite last-minute orders from AEF headquarters, that its troops should not take part in offensive operations led by non-US generals. Thus Hamel was historically significant as the first major offensive operation during the war to involve US infantry.

The AEF used French and British equipment. Particularly appreciated were the French canon de 75 modèle 1897, the canon de 155 C modèle 1917 Schneider, and the canon de 155mm GPF. American aviation units received the SPAD XIII and Nieuport 28 fighters, and the U.S. Army tank corps used French Renault FT light tanks. Pershing established facilities in France to train new arrivals with their new weapons. 
By the end of 1917, four divisions were deployed in a large training area near Verdun: the 1st Division, a regular army formation; the 26th Division, a National Guard division; the 2nd Division, a combination of regular troops and U.S. Marines; and the 42nd &quot;Rainbow&quot; Division, a National Guard division made up of soldiers from nearly every state in the United States. The fifth division, the 41st Division, was converted into a depot division near Tours.

===Logistics===
Logistic operations were under the direction of Chicago banker Charles G. Dawes, with the rank first of colonel and then brigadier general. Dawes reported directly to Gen. Pershing. Dawes recommended in May 1918 that the allies set up a joint logistics planning board, which was approved by the Allies in the form of the Military Board of Allied Supply (MBAS), which coordinated logistics and transportation on the Western and Italian fronts.

Supporting the two million soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean was a massive logistical enterprise. In order to be successful, the Americans needed to create a coherent support structure with very little institutional knowledge. The AEF developed support network appropriate for the huge size of the American force. It rested upon the Services of Supply in the rear areas, with ports, railroads, depots, schools, maintenance facilities, bakeries, clothing repair shops (termed salvage), replacement depots, ice plants, and a wide variety of other activities.

The Services of Supply initiated support techniques that would last well into the Cold War including forward maintenance, field cooking, graves registration (mortuary affairs), host nation support, motor transport, and morale services. The work of the logisticians enabled the success of the AEF and contributed to the emergence of the American Army as a modern fighting force.

===African Americans===

African Americans were drafted on the same basis as whites and made up 13 percent of the draftees. By the end of the war, over 350,000 African-Americans had served in AEF units on the Western Front. However, they were assigned to segregated units commanded by white officers. One fifth of the black soldiers sent to France saw combat, compared to two-thirds of the whites. They were three percent of AEF combat forces, and under two percent of battlefield fatalities. &quot;The mass of the colored drafted men cannot be used for combatant troops&quot;, said a General Staff report in 1918, and it recommended that &quot;these colored drafted men be organized in reserve labor battalions.&quot; They handled unskilled labor tasks as stevedores in the Atlantic ports and common laborers at the camps and in the Services of the Rear in France. The French, whose front-line troops were resisting combat duties to the point of mutiny, requested and received control of several regiments of black combat troops. Kennedy reports &quot;Units of the black 92nd Division particularly suffered from poor preparation and the breakdown in command control. As the only black combat division, the 92nd Division entered the line with unique liabilities. It had been deliberately dispersed throughout several camps during its stateside training; some of its artillery units were summoned to France before they had completed their courses of instruction, and were never fully equipped until after the Armistice; nearly all its senior white officers scorned the men under their command and repeatedly asked to be transferred. The black enlisted men were frequently diverted from their already attenuated training opportunities in France in the summer of 1918 and put to work as stevedores and common laborers.&quot;

The 369th, 370th, 371st, and 372nd Infantry Regiments (nominally the 93d Division, but never consolidated as such) served with distinction under French command with French colonial units in front-line combat. The French did not harbor the same levels of disdain based on skin color and for many Americans of African descent it was a liberating and refreshing experience. These African-American soldiers wore American uniforms, some dating from the time of the Union Army, with French helmets and were armed with French Model 1907/15 Berthier rifle manufactured by Remington Arms, rather than the M1903 Springfield or M1917 Enfield rifles issued to most American soldiers. One of the most distinguished units was the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters. The 369th was on the front lines for six months, longer than any other African-American regiment in the war. One hundred seventy-one members of the 369th were awarded the Legion of Merit. One member of the 369th, Sergeant Henry Johnson, was awarded the French &quot;Croix de guerre&quot;, and posthumously the Medal of Honor.

==Actions during World War I==
At the beginning, during the spring of 1918, the four battle-ready U.S. divisions were deployed under French and British command to gain combat experience by defending relatively quiet sectors of their lines. After the first offensive action and American-led AEF victory on 28 May 1918 at the Battle of Cantigny, by the U.S. 1st Division, and a similar local action by the 2nd Division at Belleau Wood beginning 6 June, both while assigned under French Corps command, Pershing worked towards the deployment of an independent US field Army. The rest followed at an accelerating pace during the spring and summer of 1918. By June Americans were arriving in-theater at the rate of 10,000 a day; most of which entered training by British, Canadian and Australian battle-experienced officers and senior non-commissioned ranks. The training took a minimum of six weeks due to the inexperience of the servicemen.

The first offensive action by AEF units serving under non-American command was 1,000 men (four companies from the 33d Division), with the Australian Corps during the Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918. (Corporal Thomas A. Pope was awarded the Medal of Honor for this battle.) This battle took place under the overall command of the Australian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir John Monash. The Allied force in this battle combined artillery, armor, infantry, and air support (combined arms), which served as a blueprint for all subsequent Allied attacks, using &quot;tanks&quot;.
U.S. Army and Marine Corps troops played a key role in helping stop the German thrust towards Paris, during the Second Battle of the Marne in June 1918 (at the Battle of Château-Thierry (1918) and the Battle of Belleau Wood). The first major and distinctly American offensive was the reduction of the Saint Mihiel salient during September 1918. During the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, Pershing commanded the U.S. First Army, composed of seven divisions and more than 500,000 men, in the largest offensive operation ever undertaken by United States armed forces. This successful offensive was followed by the Meuse-Argonne offensive, lasting from September 26 to November 11, 1918, during which Pershing commanded more than one million American and French combatants. In these two military operations, Allied forces recovered more than 200 sq mi (488 km2) of French territory from the German army. By the time the World War I Armistice had suspended all combat on November 11, 1918, the American Expeditionary Forces had evolved into a modern, combat-tested army.

Late in the war, American units ultimately fought in two other theaters at the request of the European powers. Pershing sent troops of the 332d Infantry Regiment to Italy, and President Wilson agreed to send some troops, the 27th and 339th Infantry Regiments, to Russia. These latter two were known as the American Expeditionary Force Siberia, and the American Expeditionary Force North Russia.

==Casualties==

The AEF sustained about 320,000 casualties: 53,402 battle deaths, 63,114 noncombat deaths and 204,000 wounded. Relatively few men suffered actual injury from poison gas, although much larger numbers mistakenly thought that they had been exposed. The 1918 influenza pandemic in late 1918 raged in the U.S. and France, where it took the lives of more than 25,000 men with the AEF, while another 360,000 became gravely ill. 

==Demobilization==
After the Armistice of November 11, 1918 thousands of Americans were sent home and demobilized. On July 27, 1919, the number of soldiers discharged amounted to 3,028,487 members of the military, and only 745,845 left in the American Expeditionary Forces.

==American Expeditionary Forces University at Beaune==
The AEF established the American Expeditionary Forces University at Beaune, complete with its own chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Faculty included Walter M. Chandler, a Progressive Party member and, later, a Republican Party member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the State of New York. Botanist Edwin Blake Payson was also an instructor there. Rudolph Hjalmar Gjelsness served as librarian.

<text>The American soles are a family (Achiridae) of flatfish occurring in both freshwater and marine environments of the Americas. The family includes about 35 species in seven genera. These are closely related to the soles (Soleidae), and have been classified as a subfamily of it, but achirids have a number of distinct characteristics.

Eyes are on the right side, and the eyed-side lower lip has a distinctive fleshy rim. The dorsal and anal fins are usually separate from the caudal fin. The pectoral fins are small or nonexistent. They are fairly small; only &quot;Achirus achirus&quot; is known to surpass in length.

<doc id="313155" wikidata="Q164083" url="?curid=313155" title="Till Eulenspiegel">
<text>Till Eulenspiegel (; ) is the protagonist of a European narrative tradition. A German chapbook published around 1510 is the oldest known extant publication about the folk hero (a first edition of is preserved fragmentarily), but a background in earlier Middle Low German folklore is likely. The character may have been based on a historical person.

Eulenspiegel is a native of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg whose picaresque career takes him to many places throughout the Holy Roman Empire. 
He plays practical jokes on his contemporaries, at every turn exposing vices. His life is set in the first half of the 14th century, and the final chapters of the chapbook describe his death from the plague of 1350.

Eulenspiegel&#x27;s surname translates to &quot;owl-mirror&quot;; and the frontispiece of the 1515 chapbook, as well as his alleged tombstone in Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein, render it as a rebus comprising an owl and a hand mirror. It has been suggested that the name is in fact a pun on a Low German phrase that translates as &quot;wipe-arse&quot;.

Modern retellings of the Eulenspiegel story have been published since the latter 19th century. &quot;The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak&quot;, by Charles De Coster (1867), transfers the character to the period of the Reformation and the Dutch Revolt; the novel&#x27;s &quot;Ulenspiegel&quot; (in modern Dutch, &quot;Tijl Uilenspiegel&quot;) was adopted as a symbol by the Flemish Movement.

== Origin and historicity ==

According to the chapbook, Eulenspiegel was born in Kneitlingen in Lower Saxony near Brunswick around 1300. As a vagrant (&quot;Landfahrer&quot;), he travelled through the Holy Roman Empire, especially Northern Germany, but also the Low Countries, Bohemia, and Italy. 
He is said to have died in Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein, near Lübeck and Hamburg, of the Black Death in 1350.

The first known chapbook on Eulenspiegel was printed in –1512 in Strasbourg. It is reasonable to place the folkloristic origins of the tradition in the 15th century, although, in spite of suggestions to the effect &quot;that the name &#x27;Eulenspiegel&#x27; was used in tales of rogues and liars in Lower Saxony as early as 1400&quot;, 15th-century references to a Till Eulenspiegel turn out to be surprisingly elusive. 
The text of the first extant edition, printed by Johannes Grüninger, is in the High German language. 
There has been a debate surrounding the possible existence of an older Low German edition, now lost.
This version has been attributed to Hans Dorn, the only known printer active in Brunswick at the beginning of the 16th century (active from at least 1502). Sodmann (1980) in support of this hypothesis adduced the woodcut of a fool on horseback holding a hand mirror used by Dorn in later prints, as the title illustration of his &quot;Liber Vagatorum&quot; and &quot;Grobianus&quot;, which may originally have served as the title illustration of the lost Eulenspiegel edition.

There are several suggestions as to the author of the 1510 chapbook, none of which has gained mainstream acceptance. 
Candidates include Thomas Murner, Hermann Bote, Hieronymus Brunschwig, or an author collective surrounding Johannes Grüninger, including Thomas Murner, Johannes Adelphus, Tilemann Conradi and Hermannus Buschius.
The author of the 1515 edition in a short preface identifies himself only as &quot;N&quot;. He gives the year 1500 as the date when he originally began to collect the tales, stressing the difficulty of the project and how he wanted to abandon it several times, saying that he is now publishing it after all to &quot;lighten the mood in hard times&quot;. The preface also announces the inclusion of material from Pfaff Amis and Pfaff vom Kahlenberg, but no such material is present in the 1515 edition.
The literal translation of the High German name &quot;Eulenspiegel&quot; is &quot;owl-mirror&quot; (hence &quot;owle-glasse&quot;). It is both innocuous and indicative of his character and has been explained as a garbled form of an expression for &quot;wipe-the-arse&quot;.

Many of Till&#x27;s pranks are scatological in nature, and involve tricking people into touching, smelling, or even eating Till&#x27;s excrement.
Scatological stories abound, beginning with Till&#x27;s early childhood (in which he rides behind his father and exposes his rear-end to the townspeople) and persisting until his death bed (where he tricks a priest into soiling his hands with feces).

In modern scholarship, there have been some attempts to find evidence for the historicity of Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s person. 
Hucker (1980) mentions that according to a contemporary legal register of the city of Brunswick one &quot;Till van Cletlinge&quot; (&quot;Till from/of Kneitlingen&quot;) was incarcerated there in the year 1339, along with four of his accomplices, for highway robbery.
In Mölln, the reported site of Eulenspiegel&#x27;s death and burial in the plague year of 1350, a memorial stone was commissioned by the town council in 1544, now on display in an alcove on the outside wall of the tower of St. Nicolai church. The stone is inscribed in Low German, as follows:
The inscription (including the date of 1350) was allegedly copied from an older tombstone, now lost. This older tombstone is referred to in the chapbook of 1515, and it is mentioned as still being extant in 1536.
The 1544 stone is mentioned by Fynes Moryson in his &quot;Itinerary&quot; of 1591.
Moryson also reports that in his time, the citizens of Mölln held a yearly festival in Eulenspiegel&#x27;s honour, on which occasion they would present the clothes worn by Eulenspiegel when he died.

== Chapbook tradition ==

The two earliest printed editions, in Early New High German, were printed by Johannes Grüninger in Strasbourg. The first edition was unknown before sixteen folia of printing proofs 
were discovered in 1971 in the binding of a Latin edition of Reynard.
Peter Honegger dated these pages to 1510/11 based on the type used, but this date has since been called into question. 
Only a single specimen of the first edition has been preserved, discovered in 1975. Thirty folia are missing, including the title page. 
A previous owner has replaced the missing pages by pages torn from an Eulenspiegel edition of c. 1700.
It was most likely published in 1512. The sixteen folia discovered by Honegger are likely printing proofs for this edition.
It consists of 100 folia with 66 woodcuts of high quality.

The 1515 edition was also printed by Grüninger in Strasbourg. Its full title reads:
The text is divided into 95 chapters (numbered to 96 as chapter number 42 is missing).
The 1515 edition is decidedly inferior, missing many of the illustrations of the older edition, and showing signs of careless copying of the text.
It is uncertain how many of these chapters were present in the earlier edition of 1510/12, although some of the chapters appear to be later additions. The initials of the final six chapters form the &quot;acrostic&quot; &quot;ERMANB&quot;, which has been taken as a hidden reference to the book&#x27;s author.
The first chapters are dedicated to Till&#x27;s childhood. In chapter nine, Till leaves his mother and begins his life as a vagrant. He takes up diverse occupations, but each chapter ends with his moving on to another place.
The final seven chapters are dedicated to his death and burial.

In the chapbooks, Eulenspiegel is presented as a trickster who plays practical jokes on his contemporaries, exposing vices at every turn, greed and folly, hypocrisy and foolishness. As Peter Carels notes, &quot;The fulcrum of his wit in a large number of the tales is his literal interpretation of figurative language.&quot; (Previously, Goethe made a similar observation.) Although craftsmen are featured as the principal victims of his pranks, neither the nobility nor the pope is exempt from being affected by him.

A third Strasbourg edition, of 1519, is better again and is usually used in modern editions to provide the sections that are missing in the surviving 1510/12 copy.
The &#x27;Antwerp group&#x27; of Eulenspiegel editions comprises a number of Flemish, French and English publications. The dating of these publications is still an issue of contention. The Antwerp printer Michiel Hillen van Hoochstraten is believed to have printed the first Dutch-language version of the Till Eulenspiegel story. In the past, the Hillen edition was dated to 1512 or 1519, but recent scholarship places it in the period between 1525 and 1546. Michiel Hillen van Hoochstraten appears to have used for his translation a German text, in manuscript or printed, that is now lost, which antedated the Grüninger edition. Jan van Doesborch is believed to have printed the first English translation in Antwerp possibly as early as 1520. In this edition the name &quot;Ulenspiegel&quot; is rendered &quot;Howleglas&quot; (as it were &quot;owl-glass&quot;). Later English editions, derived from the Antwerp group, were printed by William Copland in London, in 1547 and 1568.

&quot;Owleglasse&quot; is mentioned in Henry Porter&#x27;s &quot;The Two Angry Women of Abington&quot; (1599) and again in Ben Jonson&#x27;s comedic play &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (1610).

The first modern edition of the chapbook of 1519 is by Lappenberg (1854). Lappenberg was not yet aware of the existence of the 1515 edition.
The 1515 and 1519 editions were published in facsimile by Insel-Ferlag in 1911 and 1979, respectively.
An English translation by Paul Oppenheimer was published in 1972.

Editions of Eulenspiegel in German, Dutch, Flemish, French and English remained popular throughout the early modern period. By the late 17th century, Eulenspiegel and his pranks had become proverbial, with the French adjective &quot;espiègle&quot; &quot;impish, mischievous&quot; derived from his name. The German noun &quot;Eulenspiegelei&quot; (as it were &quot;owlglassery&quot;) is recorded in the early 19th century.

== Modern reception ==

=== Literature ===
Hans Sachs (1494-1576) the renowned Meistersinger of Nuremberg drew material from the &quot;Volksbuch&quot; for 46 of his comic tales (&quot;Schwänke&quot;) and Carnival plays &quot;(Fastnachtspiele&quot;). Thirty of the &quot;Schwänke&quot; were set to Meistersinger melodies &quot;(töne&quot;). Fellow Nuremberger Jacob Ayrer (1544-1605) also produced an Eulenspiegel Carnival play.

In the eighteenth century, German satirists adopted episodes for social satire, and in the nineteenth and early twentieth century versions of the tales were bowdlerized to render them fit for children, who had come to be considered their chief natural audience, by expurgating their many scatological references.

&quot;The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak&quot;, an 1867 novel by Belgian author Charles De Coster, has been translated, often in mutilated versions, into many languages. 
It was De Coster who first transferred Ulenspiegel from his original late medieval surroundings to the Protestant Reformation. In this version, Ulenspiegel was born in Damme, West Flanders and became a Protestant hero of the Dutch Revolt. The author gives him a father, Claes, and mother, Soetkin, as well as a girlfriend, Nele, and a best friend, Lamme Goedzak. In the course of the story Claes is taken prisoner by the Spanish oppressors and burned at the stake, while Soetkin goes insane as a result. This tempts Thyl to start resistance against the Spanish oppressors. Thanks to the 1867 novel, Ulenspiegel has become a symbol of Flemish nationalism, with a statue dedicated to him in Damme.

Alfred Jarry, author of &quot;Gestes et opinions du Docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien&quot; (1911), mentions Ulenspiegel&#x27;s unruly behaviour in the Appendix chapter entitled &quot;Les poteaux de la morale&quot;: « Till Ulenspiegel, on s’en souvient, ne coordonnait point autrement ses opérations mentales : se dirigeant vers un faîte, il se réjouissait du dévalement futur. » (&quot;Till Ulenspiegel, we recall, did not coordinate his mental operations differently: heading toward a cliff, he rejoiced in future downfall.&quot;)

A French edition, &quot;Les Aventures de Til Ulespiègle&quot;, was published by Constantin Castéra in 1910.
In 1927, Gerhart Hauptmann wrote the verse &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;.

Ulenspiegel was mentioned in Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; as a possible prototype for the black cat character Behemoth.

Michael Rosen adapted the story into a 1989 children&#x27;s novel, illustrated by Fritz Wegner: &quot;The Wicked Tricks of Till Owlyglass&quot;, .

Daniel Kehlmann in his novel &quot;Tyll&quot; (2017) places Tyll &quot;Ulenspiegel&quot; in the context of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The Italian civil law professor Francesco Gazzoni uses the name Till Eulenspiegel as a pseudonym for himself in his book &quot;Favole quasi giuridiche&quot; (in English, &quot;Semi-juridical Fables&quot;).

=== Comics ===
Ray Goossens had a 1945 comic strip based on &quot;Tijl Uilenspiegel&quot;, where Tijl and Lamme Goedzak were portrayed as a comedic duo. The series was sometimes called &quot;Tijl en Lamme&quot; too.

Willy Vandersteen drew two comic book albums about Uilenspiegel, &quot;De Opstand der Geuzen&quot; (&quot;The Rebellion of the Geuzen&quot;) and &quot;Fort Oranje&quot; (&quot;Fort Orange&quot;), both drawn in a realistic, serious style and pre-published in the Belgian comics magazine &quot;Tintin&quot; between 1952 and 1954. They were published in comic book album format in 1954 and 1955. The stories were drawn in a realistic style and in some instances followed the original novel very closely, but sometimes followed his own imagination more.

Belgian comics artist George van Raemdonck adapted the novel into a comic strip in 1964.

Between 1985 and 1990, Willy Vandersteen drew a comics series named &quot;De Geuzen&quot; of whom the three main characters are Hannes, his girlfriend Veerle and Tamme, Hannes&#x27; best friend. All are obviously inspired by Tijl Uilenspiegel, Nele and Lamme Goedzak.

=== Theatre ===
Kibbutz theatre director and producer Shulamit Bat-Dori created an open-air production of &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; at Mishmar HaEmek, Israel, in 1955 that drew 10,000 viewers.

In Moscow in 1974, Grigoriy Gorin adapted De Coster&#x27;s novel as a play originally entitled &quot;The Passion of Tyl. A Two-Part Farcical Comedy&quot; (&quot;The Passion of&quot; had to be removed later) which alluded to the state of the Soviet Union. Performed at the Lenkom Theatre with music by Gennady Gladkov it had elements of rock opera. In 2019, the original libretto was restored and official soundtrack released.

Clive Barker incorporated elements of the Till Eulenspiegel story in his 1982 play &quot;Crazyface&quot;.

=== Music ===
In 1894–1895, Richard Strauss composed the tone poem, &quot;Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche&quot;, Op. 28.

In 1902, Emil von Reznicek adapted the story as an opera, &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;.

In 1913, Walter Braunfels adapted the story as an opera, &quot;Ulenspiegel&quot;.

In 1916, the Ballets Russes adapted the story as a ballet, later re-adapted by George Balanchine for Jerome Robbins at the New York City Ballet.

In the late 1930s or early 1940s, the Russian composer Wladimir Vogel wrote a drama-oratorio, &quot;Thyl Claes&quot;, derived from De Coster&#x27;s book.

In 1983, the Soviet composer Nikolai Karetnikov and his librettist, filmmaker Pavel Lungin, released a &quot;samizdat&quot; opera, &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;, which received its official release in 1990.

The Polish poet Jacek Kaczmarski wrote a epitaph to Eulenspiegel in 1981 &quot;Epitafium dla Sowizdrzała&quot;.

=== Magazines ===
Between 1945 and 1950, a German satirical magazine was called &quot;Ulenspiegel&quot;.
The satirical magazine &quot;Eulenspiegel&quot; was published from 1954 in Berlin, East Germany.

=== Dance ===

In 1916, choreograper Vaslav Nijinsky created the ballet &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; set to &quot;Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche&quot;, Op. 28. by Richard Strauss. The libretto was by Vaslav Nijinsky, after Charles De Coster and the costumes were by Robert Edmond Jones. The work premiered on 23 October 1916 at the Manhattan Opera House in New York City.

=== Films ===
In 1956, the film &quot;Les Aventures de Till L&#x27;Espiègle&quot; was made by Gérard Philipe and Joris Ivens, which adapted De Coster&#x27;s novel. (English title: &quot;Bold Adventure&quot;). The film was a French-East German co-production.

In 1973, Walter van der Kamp directed &quot;Uilenspiegel&quot;, a Dutch film.

Rainer Simon directed &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; in 1975, which was an East-German production made for State Television. Due to Nudity, it was not suitable for children as State Television banned airing the film before 7pm (this version is an adult version).

&quot;Ulenspiegel (Legenda o Tile)&quot;, was a 1976 Soviet film, based on De Coster&#x27;s novel, and directed by Aleksandr Alov and Vladimir Naumov, &quot;The Legend of Till Ullenspiegel&quot; (1976).

In 2003, Eberhard Junkersdorf adapted the story into a feature-length animated film.

In 2014, Christian Theede directed the film &quot;&quot;.

=== Television ===
In 1961, the BRT (nowadays the VRT) made a children&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Tijl Uilenspiegel&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are three museums in Germany featuring Till Eulenspiegel. One is located in the town of Schöppenstedt in Lower Saxony, which is nearby his assumed birthplace Kneitlingen. The second is located in the supposed place of his death, the city of Mölln in Schleswig-Holstein, and the third in Bernburg (Saale), Sachsen-Anhalt. In the town of Damme, Belgium, there is also a museum honoring him, and there is a fountain and statue featuring Till Eulenspiegel in the Marktplatz of Magdeburg, capital city of Sachsen-Anhalt.

=== Other ===
TES, the first BDSM organization founded in the United States, formerly known as The Eulenspiegel Society, took its original name from Till Eulenspiegel. TES was founded in 1971 and had the name &quot;The Eulenspiegel Society&quot; until it formally changed its name to &quot;TES&quot; in 2002. The original name was inspired by a passage from Austrian psychoanalyst Theodor Reik&#x27;s &quot;Masochism in Modern Man&quot; (1941), in which he argues that patients who engage in self-punishing or provocative behavior do so in order to demonstrate their emotional fortitude, induce guilt in others, and achieve a sense of &quot;victory through defeat&quot;. Reik describes Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s &quot;peculiar&quot; behavior—he enjoys walking uphill, and feels &quot;dejected&quot; walking downhill—and compares it to a &quot;paradox reminiscent of masochism&quot;, because Till Eulenspiegel &quot;gladly submits to discomfort, enjoys it, even transforms it into pleasure&quot;.

<text>Stack is a tool to build projects and manage their dependencies for the programming language Haskell. It uses the Cabal library but with a curated version of the Hackage software repository named &quot;Stackage&quot;. 

Stack competes against Cabal&#x27;s binary file cabal-install and has been created as a result of the overall criticism about dependency problems. However, it does not provide its own package format, but uses extant codice_1 files and complements projects with an added codice_2 file.

<doc id="313161" wikidata="Q311235" url="?curid=313161" title="Dipendra of Nepal">
<text>Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev () (27 June 1971 – 4 June 2001) was King of Nepal for three days from 1 to 4 June 2001. For the duration of his three-day reign he was in a coma after the shooting of his father King Birendra, his mother Queen Aishwarya, his younger brother and sister, five other members of the royal family, and himself in an event known as the Nepalese royal massacre. Upon Dipendra&#x27;s death, his paternal uncle Gyanendra became king.

== Early life ==
Dipendra was born on 27 June 1971 at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace as the eldest child of Birendra, the Crown Prince of Nepal, and Princess Aishwarya.

==Education==
Dipendra received his early education from Kanti Ishwori High School, Kathmandu. He then went to Budhanilkantha School in Kathmandu. Later, he attended Eton College in the United Kingdom. After Eton, he attended Tri Chandra college affiliated with Tribhuvan University in Nepal and later joined the Military Academy in Kharipati, Nepal. He studied Geography at Tribhuvan University for his master&#x27;s degree and was an all Nepal topper receiving a gold medal. He was a PhD. student at the same university. He received military training from the Academy of Royal Nepalese Gurkha Army and pilot training from the Civil Aviation Department.

==Interests==
Dipendra was interested in the fields of social service and sports. He attended various national and international sports ceremonies where Nepalese players participated. Dipendra became a karateka when he was studying in Britain and received a black belt at around the age of 20. He was a patron of the National Sports Council and Nepal&#x27;s Scouts. Dipendra also wrote articles that were published in Nepalese periodicals. His writings were often on the motifs of nationhood and nationality.

In March 1993, on the visit of the Princess of Wales to Nepal, he ordered police to close down the roads so that he could give her a late-night tour of Kathmandu in his sports car.

==Nepalese royal massacre==

On 1 June 2001, Dipendra opened fire at a house on the grounds of the Narayanhiti Royal Palace, the residence of the Nepalese monarchy, where a party was being held. He shot and killed his father, King Birendra, his mother, Queen Aishwarya, his younger brother and sister and other members of the royal family before shooting himself in the head. Because the king was now dead, he as crown prince became king while in a comatose state from the head wound.

His motive for the murders is unknown, but there are various theories. Dipendra desired to marry Devyani Rana, the daughter of an Indian princess whom he had met in England, but due to her father&#x27;s lower caste and her father&#x27;s political alliances, Dipendra&#x27;s parents objected; he was told that he would have to give up his claim to the throne in order to marry her. Other theories allege that Dipendra was unhappy with the country&#x27;s shift from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy, and that too much power had been given away following the 1990 People&#x27;s Movement.

Much controversy surrounds the circumstances of the massacre, and even today, with the monarchy abolished, many questions remain within Nepal about its cause. Sources of the yet unanswered questions include details such as the apparent lack of security at the event; the absence of Prince Gyanendra, Dipendra&#x27;s uncle who succeeded him, from the party; the fact that, despite being right-handed, Dipendra&#x27;s self-inflicted head-wound was located at his left temple; and finally that the subsequent investigation lasted for only two weeks and did not involve any major forensic analysis.

==Portrayals==
*Upendra portrayed the crown prince in the 2002 Indian film &quot;Super Star&quot;, which was loosely based on the massacre.
*Indian actor Ashish Kapoor portrayed the role of Dipendra in the third season of the documentary series &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, it showed a reconstruction of the massacre taken from surviving eyewitnesses.

<doc id="313162" wikidata="Q4243331" url="?curid=313162" title="Kula, Hawaii">
<text>Kula is a district and census-designated place (CDP) of Maui, Hawaii. It stretches across Upcountry Maui, the western-facing slopes of Haleakalā. Most residential areas lie between about in elevation. The district is distinct from the generally hotter and busier coastal areas. The population of the Kula CDP at the 2020 Census was 6,942, while the larger Kula Census County Division, which includes the communities of upland Keokea and coastal Wailea and Makena, had a population of 12,864.

==Description==

Kula roughly extends from Haleakala Highway (Hawaii Route 37) in the north to Keokea in the south—a distance of about around 20°47&#x27;32&quot; N, 156°19&#x27;37&quot; W. The largely rural area known as Upper Kula includes the region up-slope (southeast) from Lower Kula, the more densely populated area spread along the Kula Highway.

The word &quot;Kula&quot; means &quot;dry, open country&quot; in the Hawaiian language.

On Maui, Kula is one of the island&#x27;s 12 &quot;foundation&quot; districts of ancient Hawaii called &quot;moku&quot;. The Kula district is the island&#x27;s largest, extending from dry coastal areas to the wetter high pasture lands of three major ranches (Haleakala, Erewhon, and Ulupalakua) that cap the region about halfway up the slopes of Haleakala. It laterally extends from Keokea to near Makawao where the rainforest of East Maui once began.

In leeward areas, away from the prevailing moist tradewinds—called the rain shadow of Haleakala—the lower portion of Maui consists of a broad, arid expanse where little cultivation of the earth is possible. This zone consists of dry, desert-like open range just inland from the sea in artificially irrigated Kihei, and is covered with kiawe trees to an elevation of about on the volcano&#x27;s slopes.

Between this zone and the upper reaches of the hillsides, especially up steep Waipoli and Poli Poli Roads, are broad, open areas for vegetable and fruit crops. The moderate climate often yields as many as three or four harvests per year.

When the territorial legislature first set up the political design in 1906, they decreed only two levels of government: state and county. Consequently, Hawaii&#x27;s towns do not have specific boundaries or &quot;city limits&quot;. There are also no official district boundaries for Maui County elections.

===Upper Kula===
The twisty Haleakala Highway, from its junction with Kula Highway in Pukalani, loosely defines the northern edge of Upper Kula. The upper road (Kekaulike Avenue), also known as State Highway 377, leads up through usually green pastures, silver eucalyptus tree groves (and blue jacaranda trees in late spring), contrasting to the sugarcane below. Where the road beyond Kula Lodge makes an abrupt upward tack to Haleakala National Park, the area known as Upper Kula surrounds Kekaulike Avenue. In less than five miles it descends the slope to rejoin the Kula Highway near Rice Park and heads south to Keokea.

There is little commercial development along Kekaulike except Kula Botanical Garden and Alii Kula Lavender Farm. Vegetable and flower gardens surround the meandering highway as farmers take advantage of the area&#x27;s unique combination of open space, good soil, moisture-laden clouds and filtered tropical sun.

New homes dot the area, taking advantage of the moderate weather and bi-coastal views of the isthmus below.

In Keokea, the Kula Hospital sits on the hillside above the road. Originally a tuberculosis treatment sanatorium built in 1909, Kula Hospital now serves the community as a critical access hospital.

The southern edge of Kula had a once-flourishing Chinese community that numbered over 700 immigrant workers and farmers. While the area is now more mixed, Keokea is still home to a pair of Chinese family-owned stores and a service station as well as a boutique coffee-shop.

At , a mile or so beyond Keokea, between mile markers 18 and 19 on the Kula highway (aka Highway 37), is the county park dedicated to Maui&#x27;s former resident, Sun Yat-sen, called the &quot;father of modern China&quot;. He grew up in the area in the late 19th century living with his brother Sun Mei (). He led the revolution that ended China&#x27;s last dynasty and established the Republic of China in 1912.

Just as upcountry residents visit the seashore, residents near the shore sometimes visit Upper Kula to enjoy cooler temperatures that may require a fireplace in winter. A popular saying is &quot;It&#x27;s cooler in Kula.&quot;

===Lower Kula===
Lower Kula lies between about of elevation along the western flank of Haleakalā, the dormant volcano that dominates the island&#x27;s landscape and is the foundation of Kula’s backdrop.

Communities along the old Lower Kula Road with names like Pulehu, Waiakoa, Omaopio and Keokea each have unique history of ethnic settlement. In the late 19th century, Portuguese and Chinese immigrants, who fulfilled labor contracts with the sugarcane plantations, moved to this area. Later, Japanese farmers moved into the area for its fertile earth.

These farmers have been producing vegetables ever since. In fact, during the California gold rush the farmers in Kula shipped so many potatoes that it was nicknamed &quot;Nu Kaleponi,&quot; a Hawaiian pronunciation of &quot;New California.&quot;

That farming tradition continues today, even among the gentlemen farmers and their farms that have sprung up in the past two decades. Kula grows its well-known onions, lettuce, potatoes, jicama, tomatoes, carrots, cauliflower and cabbage. It is also a major source of cut flowers for the state. Most of Hawaii&#x27;s proteas, as well as nearly all the carnations used in leis, come from Kula.

Lower Kula encompasses the areas around Lower Kula Road, the old county road that once spanned the region before Kula Highway was finished in 1964. The old meandering road crosses the straight modern highway several times between Pukalani and Keokea.

Even after nearly 50 years, there are few businesses along the highway, while the old road has the usual establishments that serve rural communities, including historic churches. Holy Ghost Catholic Church has a unique octagonal shape and hand-carved altar. Its turret is a landmark on the slopes of Haleakala, visible from much of Central Maui below. It was constructed in 1894 by Portuguese immigrants.

In the past decade, the lush views and cooler climate of Lower Kula have drawn a new type of resident. Agricultural lands are carved up for &quot;gentleman estates&quot; with large homes. Clusters of homes around old Lower Kula Road are becoming denser.

The major limit on the further development in the whole Kula area is the significant lack of water. This basic resource is key to the sustainability of the area. The Upcountry Community Plan gives highest priority to the water supply of agriculture and the Hawaiian Homelands project.

==Climate==
There are many micro-climates created by the combined effects of elevation, rain shadow, and land contour. Much of the west slopes of East Maui are dry or semi-desert due to a rain shadow effect: the prevailing trade-winds are from the north-east and east and Kula is in the &quot;shadow&quot; of these winds. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Kula is the coolest place in Hawai&#x27;i, as defined by having the lowest average annual temperatures (average low temperature: 55.7 °F and average low temperature during coldest month, February: 52.6 °F). At the higher elevations and at night, especially in winter, temperatures dip into the 40s or high 30s (°F). Frosts are virtually unknown except at much higher elevations () on Haleakala.

There is a distinctive weather feature known as the &quot;Maui vortex&quot;. A wind vortex forms as the trade-winds pass around the north-west corner of Haleakala (over Pukalani) and blow southward down the central valley of Maui over Maalaea Bay and then circle back up-slope over Kihei bringing a &quot;lei of clouds&quot; late most mornings over Kula. Around sunset, the downward breezes from the summit wipe out these clouds.

Kula displays a warm summer Mediterranean Climate (Köppen climate classification Csb)


==Land use==
Kula has a strong agricultural and ranching tradition, the latter on the lands above the residential areas. Indeed, there is frequent reference in Makawao (which means &quot;edge of the forest&quot;) to a &quot;paniolo&quot; (cowboy) ambiance that derives from this ranching activity.

The Maui onion mostly grows at the lower levels of Kula (below Highway 37). It is also known for its persimmons that ripen during the fall; many are located in the Pulehuiki area. Other produce grown in Kula includes lettuce, cabbage, and herbs. Kula is also known for the many varieties of protea grown for commercial sale.

==Education==
Hawaii Department of Education operates public schools. Kula Elementary School is in Kula. Its September 1964 opening stemmed from a combination of Kealahou, Keokea, and Makena, and Ulupalakua schools. Kalama Intermediate School is the area intermediate school.

<doc id="313163" wikidata="Q704763" url="?curid=313163" title="Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr.">
<text>Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. ( ; 18 July 1886 – 18 June 1945) was a lieutenant general in the United States Army during World War II who served in the Pacific Theater. As commanding general of Alaska Defense Command, Buckner commanded American-Canadian forces in the Aleutian Islands campaign, including the Battle of Attu and the Kiska Expedition. Following that assignment, he was promoted to command the Tenth Army, which conducted the amphibious invasion of the Japanese island of Okinawa in 1945. He was killed during the closing days of the Battle of Okinawa by enemy artillery fire, making him the highest-ranking United States military officer lost to enemy fire during World War II. 

Buckner, Lesley J. McNair, Frank Maxwell Andrews, and Millard Harmon, all lieutenant generals at the time of their deaths, were the highest-ranking Americans to be killed in World War II. Buckner and McNair were posthumously promoted to the rank of four-star general on 19 July 1954, by a Special Act of Congress (Public Law 83-508).

==Early life and education==
Buckner was the son of Confederate general Simon Bolivar Buckner and his wife Delia Hayes Claiborne. Buckner and his father are named after the Venezuelan soldier and statesman, Simón Bolívar, who led what are currently the countries of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Bolivia to independence from the Spanish Empire. His father was Governor of Kentucky from 1887 to 1891, and was the Gold Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for Vice President of the United States in 1896. Buckner was raised near Munfordville, Kentucky, and accompanied his father on his 1896 presidential campaign when he served as the running mate of ex-Union general John M. Palmer.

==Military career==
Buckner attended the Virginia Military Institute. When he turned 18 in the summer of 1904, his father asked President Theodore Roosevelt to grant him an appointment to West Point. Roosevelt granted this request and Buckner graduated in the class of 1908. He served two military tours in the Philippines, and wrote about his adventures in &quot;Tales of the Philippines – In the Early 1900s&quot;. During World War I, he served as a temporary major, drilling discipline into aviator cadets.

===Inter-war period===
For the 17 years beginning May 1919, Buckner&#x27;s assignments were not with troops but with military schools as follows: four years as tactical officer at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York; one year as student at The Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia; four years at the Command and General Staff School, Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, with the first year as a student (distinguished graduate), then three years as instructor; four years at the Army War College, Washington, D.C., with year one as student then three years as executive officer; four more years at West Point, as Assistant Commandant and Commandant of Cadets. At West Point, &quot;His rule is remembered for constructive progressiveness, with a share of severity tempered with hard, sound sense, and justice.&quot; However, one cadet&#x27;s parent commented: &quot;Buckner forgets cadets are born, not quarried&quot;.

Buckner was with troops for the rest of his career. In September 1936 he became executive officer of the 23rd Infantry Regiment at Ft. Sam Houston in Texas. Promoted to colonel in January 1937, he was given command of the 66th Infantry (Light Tank) at Ft. Meade in Maryland. In September 1938, he commanded of the 22nd Infantry at Ft. McClellan, Alabama. From November 1939 to August 1940 he was Chief of Staff of the 6th Division at Camp Jackson in South Carolina, Ft. Benning in Georgia, and Camp Beauregard in Louisiana.

===World War II===

====Alaska====
Buckner was promoted to brigadier general in 1940 and was assigned to fortify and protect Alaska as commander of the Army&#x27;s Alaska Defense Command. He was promoted to major general in August 1941. He became known as a hard, tough leader, sleeping under a single sheet no matter how cold it was and denying his men the use of under arm deodorants, declaring that a man should smell like a man. Alaskan waters, including areas along the Aleutian Islands and into the Bering Sea coastline, had previously been reconnoitered by Imperial Japanese Naval vessels in the 1930s.

The potential for some kind of action was considered seriously by both US and Canadian forces. When the US was finally drawn into World War II, the defense of Alaska had already been underway – but no one knew the where, when or how the Japanese would attack. It came in a stunning surprise attack on Dutch Harbor 3–5 June 1942; farther west, Imperial Japanese forces seized the islands Kiska and Attu, bringing ashore some 7,000 troops (at Kiska) and nearly 3,000 at Attu.

American commanders, including Buckner, feared that the Japanese would use the islands as bases to strike within range along the rest of the US West Coast. The West Coast was previously attacked several times in the past six months (including unrestricted submarine warfare in coastal waters, the bombardment of the lighthouse at Estevan Point on Vancouver Island by submarine I-26, as well, I-25 torpedoed and shelled the freighter S.S. Fort Camosun off Cape Flattery, Washington State. The freighter did not sink and rescuers towed it to safety in Neah Bay. plus the bombardment of Ellwood in California and the bombardment of Fort Stevens in Oregon). Lieutenant Paul Bishop of the 28th Bombardment Group recalled that:

Buckner gave orders in June 1942 for the indigenous Aleut people to be evacuated and for their villages to be burned. The Aleut people were not allowed to return until 1945, after the war was over. Buckner furthermore objected to the deployment of African American troops in Alaska, writing to his superiors of his concern that they would remain after the war, &quot;with the natural result that they would interbreed with the Indians and the Eskimos and produce an astonishingly objectionable race of mongrels which would be a problem&quot;.

The campaign to take back Attu Island took nearly a year. The Battle for Attu, Operation Landcrab, occurred across three weeks in May 1943. The casualties on both sides were high. On shore, some 549 US soldiers were killed, 1,148 were wounded, and 1,814 suffered cold and disease. Of the 2,900 Japanese garrison, only 28 survived. Off shore and in the air overhead, many dozens of airmen and sailors of both sides lost their lives during the months of the Aleutian Campaign.

Subsequently, in August 1943, Kiska was invaded by Canadian and US soldiers. Just as at Attu, the weather conspired to aid the enemy. An estimated 5,400 soldiers and sailors had been secretly withdrawn by the Imperial Navy under cover of fog prior to the arrival of allied forces. Allied commanders refused to believe that the Japanese could have completely evacuated Kiska. For eight days, troops searched the island, firing into the dense fog and sometimes accidentally shooting their comrades. Twenty-four Allied soldiers were killed by friendly fire, four by Japanese booby traps, and a further seventy-one died when the ship &quot;Abner Read&quot; struck a floating mine. On Kidna, 168 Allied soldiers were wounded or fell ill. The bombardment and invasion of the deserted island was written off as a &quot;training exercise&quot;, and the Aleutian Campaign officially ended after 439 days of warfare. This constituted the Aleutian Islands campaign. In 1943, he was promoted to lieutenant general.

====Battle of Okinawa====

In July 1944, Buckner was sent to Hawaii to organize the Tenth Army, which was composed of both Army and Marine Corps units. The original mission of the Tenth Army was to prepare for the invasion of Taiwan; however, this operation was canceled, and Buckner&#x27;s command was instead ordered to prepare for the Battle of Okinawa. Beginning on April 1, 1945, this turned out to be one of the largest, slowest, and bloodiest sealandair battles in American military history. Despite historic amphibious assets, Buckner insisted on a frontal assault on the dug-in Japanese, although extremely costly in American lives, his strategy was ultimately successful. Late in the battle, Buckner failed to realize that the Japanese were pulling back to a secondary defensive line, allowing the Japanese to avoid destruction and escape with a significant force. Reducing this force in the southern part of the island cost enormous casualties, especially among the civilian population, who were trapped in the battle zone.

A quote of his from 1945 was reported in the newspapers back home when he said that he intended to Christianize the Japanese and that &quot;the best way to do that was to give them a Christian burial&quot;.

====Death====
On June 18, Buckner arrived in his command jeep which was flying its standard 3-star flag to visit a forward observation post on a ridge approximately behind the front lines, as Marine infantry advanced on the Japanese-held Ibaru Ridge. Visits from the general were not always welcome as his presence frequently drew enemy fire, usually as he was departing. Buckner had arrived with his standard three stars showing on the front of his steel helmet and a nearby Marine outpost sent a signal to Buckner&#x27;s position stating that they could clearly see the general&#x27;s three stars on his helmet. Told of this, Buckner replaced his own helmet with an unmarked one.

As Buckner stood at the outpost, a small flat-trajectory Japanese artillery shell of unknown caliber (estimated to have been 47mm) struck a coral rock outcrop near him, and fragments pierced his chest. Buckner was carried by stretcher to a nearby aid station, where he died on the operating table. He was succeeded in command by Marine General Roy Geiger. Total American deaths during the battle of Okinawa were 12,513.

Buckner was the highest-ranking American military officer killed during World War II, and he remained the highest-ranked officer killed in action until the death of Lieutenant General Timothy Maude during the September 11 attacks in 2001.

==Personal life==
Buckner was married to Adele Blanc Buckner (1893–1988). They had three children: Simon Bolivar Buckner III, Mary Blanc Buckner, and William Claiborne Buckner.

<doc id="313164" wikidata="Q294153" url="?curid=313164" title="Richard Arkwright">
<text>Sir Richard Arkwright (23 December 1732 – 3 August 1792) was an English inventor and a leading entrepreneur during the early Industrial Revolution. He is credited as the driving force behind the development of the spinning frame, known as the water frame after it was adapted to use water power; and he patented a rotary carding engine to convert raw cotton to &#x27;cotton lap&#x27; prior to spinning. He was the first to develop factories housing both mechanised carding and spinning operations.

Arkwright&#x27;s achievement was to combine power, machinery, semi-skilled labour and the new raw material of cotton to create mass-produced yarn. His organisational skills earned him the accolade &quot;father of the modern industrial factory system,&quot; notably through the methods developed in his mill at Cromford, Derbyshire (now preserved as part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site).

==Life and family==

Richard Arkwright was born in Preston, Lancashire, England on 23 December 1732, the youngest of seven surviving children. His father, Thomas, was a tailor and a Preston Guild burgess. Richard&#x27;s parents, Sarah and Thomas, could not afford to send him to school and instead arranged for him to be taught to read and write by his cousin Ellen. He was apprenticed to a Mr Nicholson, a barber at the nearby town of Kirkham, and began his working life as a barber and wig-maker, setting up a shop at Churchgate in Bolton in the early 1760s. It was here that he invented a waterproof dye for use on the fashionable periwigs of the time, the income from which later funded his prototype cotton machinery.

Arkwright married his first wife, Patience Holt, in 1755. They had a son, Richard Arkwright Junior, who was born the same year. Patience died in 1756, and then in 1761 Arkwright, aged 29, married Margaret Biggins. They had three children, of whom only Susannah survived to adulthood. At some time after the death of his first wife, Arkwright became interested in the development of carding and spinning machinery to replace hand labour in the conversion of raw cotton to thread for weaving.

===Spinning frame===
In 1768, Arkwright and John Kay, a clockmaker, returned to Preston, renting rooms in a house on Stoneygate (now called Arkwright House), where they worked on a spinning machine. In 1769 Arkwright patented the spinning frame, a machine which produced twisted threads (initially for warps only), using wooden and metal cylinders rather than human fingers. This machine, initially powered by horses (see below), greatly reduced the cost of cotton-spinning, and would lead to major changes in the textile industry.

===Carding engine===
Lewis Paul had invented a machine for carding in 1748. Arkwright made improvements to this machine and in 1775 took out a patent for a new carding engine, which converted raw cotton to a continuous skein prior to spinning.
The machine used a succession of uneven rollers rotating at increasingly higher speeds to draw out the roving, before applying a twist via a bobbin-and-flyer mechanism. It could make cotton thread thin and strong enough for the warp threads of cloth.

===Cromford Mill===
Arkwright and John Smalley of Preston set up a small horse-driven factory at Nottingham. To obtain capital for expansion, Arkwright formed a partnership with Jedediah Strutt and Samuel Need, wealthy nonconformist hosiery manufacturers. In 1771, the partners built the world&#x27;s first water-powered mill at Cromford, which covered both carding and spinning operations and employed 200 people.
In 1776 Arkwright built a second, larger mill at Cromford and, soon afterwards, mills at Bakewell, Wirksworth and elsewhere (see below). His success as a businessman and innovator was widely recognized in his own time. The spinning frame was a large advance over Hargreaves&#x27;s spinning jenny, in that very little training was required to operate the machinery, which produced a strong yarn suitable for warp threads.

===Grand Patent===
To strengthen his position in relation to his many competitors and emulators, Arkwright obtained a &quot;grand patent&quot; in 1775, which he hoped would consolidate his position within the fast-growing cotton industry. Public opinion, however, was bitterly hostile to exclusive patents, and in 1781 Arkwright initiated legal proceedings to assert his rights. The case dragged on in court until 1785, when it was finally settled against him on the grounds that his specifications were deficient: the court had also heard assertions that the spinning frame was actually the invention of Arkwright&#x27;s employee John Kay, or of Thomas Highs, Kay&#x27;s previous employer.

===Factories and the factory system===

With the expansion of the mill at Cromford, it soon became apparent that the existing population of the town would be inadequate to provide the labour needed for the scale of operations which Arkwright was planning. He therefore brought in workers from outside the locality, building a cluster of cottages near the mill to house them (he also built the Greyhound public house, which still stands in Cromford market square). Stuart Fisher states that the workers&#x27; homes are now considered to be &quot;the first factory housing development in the world&quot;.

Arkwright instigated novel and highly disciplined working arrangements at Cromford. Work was organised in two 13-hour shifts per day, including an overlap for the change of shift. Bells rang at 5 am and 5 pm and the gates were shut precisely at 6 am and 6 p.m.: anyone who was late was excluded from work for the rest of the day and lost an extra day&#x27;s pay. Arkwright encouraged weavers with large families to move to Cromford. Whole families were employed, including large numbers of children as young as seven (subsequently increased to ten); and towards the end of his tenure, nearly two-thirds of the 1,150 employees were children. He allowed employees a week&#x27;s holiday a year, on condition that they did not travel beyond the town.

After establishing the mill at Cromford, Arkwright returned to Lancashire and took up a lease of the Birkacre mill at Chorley, which was to become a catalyst for the town&#x27;s growth into one of the most important industrialised towns of the Industrial Revolution.
In 1777 Arkwright leased the Haarlem Mill in Wirksworth, Derbyshire, where he installed the first steam engine to be used in a cotton mill (this was used to replenish the millpond that drove the mill&#x27;s waterwheel rather than to drive the machinery directly).
He was invited to Scotland, where he assisted David Dale in establishing cotton mills at New Lanark. A large mill of Arkwright&#x27;s at Birkacre in Lancashire, was destroyed in the anti-machinery riots of 1779.

===Later life===
Aggressive and self-sufficient, Arkwright was a difficult man to work with. He bought out all his partners and went on to build factories at Manchester, Matlock Bath, New Lanark (in partnership with David Dale) and elsewhere. He was a member of the Church of England, unlike many entrepreneurs of the time, who were often nonconformist.

Arkwright served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire and was knighted in 1786.

He also built Willersley Castle, now a Grade II* listed building, in 1791; after a fire in 1792, it was rebuilt and occupied by his son Richard Arkwright junior starting in 1796. Arkwright died at Rock House, Cromford, on 3 August 1792, aged 59, leaving a fortune of £500,000. He was buried at St Giles&#x27; Church, Matlock. His remains were later moved to the family chapel near the castle, now St Mary&#x27;s Church, Cromford.
==Memorials==

* Richard Arkwright&#x27;s barber shop in Churchgate, Bolton was demolished early in the 20th century. There is a small plaque above the door of the building that replaced it, recording Arkwright&#x27;s occupancy.
* A Greater London Council blue plaque unveiled in 1984 commemorates Arkwright at 8 Adam Street in Charing Cross, London.
* Arkwright lived at Rock House in Cromford, opposite his original mill. In 1788 he purchased an estate from William Nightingale (the father of Florence Nightingale), for £20,000 and set about building Willersley Castle for himself and his family. However just as the building was completed it was destroyed by fire, and Arkwright was forced to wait a further two years whilst it was rebuilt. He died aged 59 in 1792, never having lived in the castle, which was completed only after his death. After being a hotel owned by the Christian Guild company, Willersley Castle now belongs to outdoor adventure education company Manor Adventure.
* The Arkwright Society, set up after the bicentenary of Cromford Mill, owns the mill complex and has worked to restore it. Derwent Valley Mills, including this site, was declared by Historic England as &quot;one of the country&#x27;s 100 irreplaceable sites&quot;. It is also the centrepiece of the Derwent Valley Mills UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

* The Arkwright Scholarships Trust was set up in the UK in 1991 in Arkwright&#x27;s memory to give scholarships to aspiring future leaders in engineering and technical design. By 2014, the Trust was awarding approximately 400 scholarships annually to support students through their &#x27;A&#x27; levels and Scottish Highers, and to assist young people undertaking higher-level apprenticeships and university engineering studies. It had awarded over 5,000 scholarships as of mid 2020.

<doc id="313169" wikidata="Q162306" url="?curid=313169" title="Birendra of Nepal">
<text>Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev (), (29 December 1945 – 1 June 2001) was King of Nepal from 1972 until his assassination in 2001.

== Early life and education ==

Birendra was born at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace in Kathmandu as the eldest son of the then Crown Prince Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev and his first wife, Crown Princess Indra Rajya Lakshmi Devi.

Birendra spent eight years studying at St Joseph&#x27;s School, a Jesuit school in Darjeeling, with his brother Gyanendra. On 13 March 1955, their grandfather King Tribhuvan died and their father succeeded the Nepalese throne. With his father&#x27;s ascension, Birendra became the crown prince of Nepal.

In 1959, Birendra was enrolled at Eton College in the United Kingdom. After studying at Eton until 1964, he returned to Nepal where he began to explore the country by traveling on foot to the remote parts of the country where he lived humbly with what was available in the villages. He later completed his education by spending some time at the University of Tokyo, before studying political theory at Harvard University from 1967 to 1968. Birendra enjoyed travelling in his youth, and went on trips to Canada, Latin America, Africa, many parts of India, and a number of other Asian countries. He was also an art collector and supporter of Nepalese craftspeople and artists and learned to fly helicopters.

Birendra was married to Aishwarya Rajya Lakshmi Devi from the Rana family, his second cousin, on 27 February 1970. The wedding, which was billed as one of the most lavish Hindu nuptial ceremonies in history, cost $9.5 million to stage.

Birendra was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and had undergone angioplasty in United Kingdom as per reports in the late 1990s.

== Reign ==
=== Early years ===
Birendra ascended to the Nepalese throne on 31 January 1972, at the age of 26, after the death of his father, King Mahendra. However, his coronation was delayed until 24 February 1975, when he was 29, since the first year was considered to be a mourning period for death of king&#x27;s father and the second year was deemed to be inauspicious by religious astrologers. As a Hindu monarch, he had to follow Nepalese tradition.

=== Panchayat era ===
On his ascension to the throne, Birendra was effectively an absolute monarch, as he inherited a country where political parties were banned and he ruled through a system of local and regional councils known as panchayats.

In an attempt to maintain the &quot;panchayat&quot; system of government, prominent leaders of the Nepali Congress Party were arrested frequently. During the 1980s the restraints that had been imposed on political organizations were eased, and liberal student-led groups started to demand constitutional change in Nepal. Because of the growing pro-democracy movement Birendra announced that a referendum to decide between a party-less or a multi-party system would be held. During, referendum options were given for a multi-party system or a Panchayati system. The referendum was held in May 1980 with the party-less system winning by a margin of 55% to 45%. The result of the election led the king to make mass restructuring of country both economically and politically. After the national referendum, he divided the nation into 5 development regions in order to create balanced development and visited each division once a year; the visits were discontinued after his status as a constitutional monarchy in 1990.

=== Democratic era ===

In 1990, a series of strikes and pro-democracy riots broke out in Nepal. Due to the riots, Birendra lifted the ban on political parties and agreed to become a constitutional monarch in April 1990. He appointed an independent Constitution Recommendation Commission to represent the main opposition factions and to prepare a new constitution to accommodate their demands for political reform. The commission presented him with the draft of the proposed constitution on 10 September 1990. The new constitution would make Birendra head of state of a constitutional monarchy with a system of multiparty democracy. The draft constitution was approved by the Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai and his cabinet and so, on 9 November 1990, Birendra promulgated the new constitution transformed Nepal into a constitutional monarchy. As a constitutional monarch, Birendra became more popular than he had been as an autocratic ruler attributing to his democratic views and behaviors as well as the inability of the political parties. Birendra, however, could not prevent the Nepalese Civil War, a conflict between Maoist rebels and government forces, which lasted from 1996 until 2006.

=== Murder ===
Birendra and members of his immediate family were massacred by his son Crown Prince Dipendra on 1 June 2001 at the Narayanhiti Palace, the residence of the Nepali monarchy. After shooting himself, the comatose Dipendra was proclaimed King. He failed to regain consciousness and was declared dead a few days later. With no other royal wanting to take the throne, Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev was made the king.

== Notable works and improvements ==
=== Diplomatic campaign ===

He managed to maintain Nepal&#x27;s independence despite encroaching influences by India, China, and the Soviet Union. His first trips abroad as king were to India in October 1973 and China two months later. He prevented the breaking up of Mustang from Nepal and Tibet from China during the Mustang revolution. The disarmament of Khampas rebellions working against China brought Nepal-China relations to a new height. His compatriots remember him for his extensive campaign and contribution for the establishment of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and South Asian food reserve. During his reign, he was also able to set up the SAARC Secretariat in Kathmandu. He was able to establish diplomatic relations with additional 46 countries taking the total number of countries for diplomatic relations from 49 to 96. He further strengthened Nepal&#x27;s policy of neutrality by promoting Nepal as zone of Peace in the UN. He believed that Nepal, sandwiched between the two Asian powers, should have good relationship with both.

=== Promotion of peace ===

He proposed Nepal to be declared a zone of Peace in the United Nations meeting, taking into consideration Nepal&#x27;s historic peace status, birth of Gautam Buddha and its historical policy of Non-alignment to any foreign powers. This proposal was supported by 116 countries in the UNO. He later established a &quot;Peace Keeping Training Camp&quot; in 1986. This was later restructured into a training institute in 2001 for training peace keeping forces. It was later renamed as Birendra Peace Operations Training Centre. This institute, was later restructured as the training organization through which Nepal started sending trained, peace-keeping forces in cooperation with the UN and became an active member of it. In 1974, King Birendra was successful in peacefully disarming the Khampas rebellions, settled in the northern Himalayan region, by giving land, money and citizenship to those who surrendered their arms, and by confiscating weapons as well. Thus who did not surrender would be prohibited from moving toward the Tibetan region. Birendra is also credited with blocking the use of the army for suppressing the Maoist revolution in the country, which would&#x27;ve further aggravated the situation and disturbed the peace in the nation.

=== Environmental protection ===

King Birendra was regarded as a lover of nature and a great supporter of nature conservation. The trend of nature conservation from the government started during his reign. The dramatic decline of the rhinoceros population due to massive Terai migration and the extent of poaching prompted the government to institute the Rhino Patrol force (Nepali: &quot;गैडा गस्ती&quot; ) of 130 armed men and a network of guard posts all over Chitwan. To prevent the extinction of rhinos through a legal system, National park law was introduced which gazetted the Chitwan National Park in December 1970, with borders delineated the following year and established in 1973.

For the purpose of conservation of Tigers in the nation, an area of 368 km2 was gazetted as &quot;Royal Karnali Wildlife Reserve&quot; in 1976 which was later proclaimed as Royal Bardiya Wildlife Reserve in 1982. The Babai River Valley was further added to this reserved area in 1984. A flourishing ecosystem in the reserve later led to the proclamation of the area as national park in 1988. The country&#x27;s fourth protected area was established in 1976 from the Himalayan area of Langtang and named as Langtang National Park. For this purpose, an area of 1,710 km2 was reserved in the district of Nuwakot, Rasuwa and Sindhulpalchok. He also gazetted another wildlife reserve in 1976 as Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve. In the same year, he also established Royal Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the Terai region of far-western province which was later enlarged and converted to national park in the late 1980s. Also, another protected area, Rara National Park was established in the same year in order to protect the unique flora and fauna of Humla, Mugu and Jumla regions and to fulfil his father, King Mahendra&#x27;s dream of creating a pristine nature reserve with a reserved area of 106 km2 in the Mugu and Jumla districts which also includes the famous Rara Lake. The last National Park to be established as part of the Sacred Himalayan Landscape in the same year was Sagarmatha National Park in with reservation of area of 1,148 km2 in the Solukhumbu District.

In 1984, a 225 km2 area of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti was set aside as a protected area in the Far-Western Region, Nepal and was named Khaptad National Park. In the same year, he also established Parsa Wildlife Reserve which was later extended to a National Park. Similarly, the nation&#x27;s only trans-Himalayan national park, Shey Phoksundo National Park, was established in 1984 with an area of 3,555 square Kilometers in the districts of Dolpa and Mugu in the Karnali Province which also included the famous Phoksundo Lake.

In order to preserve the royal tradition of hunting as a hobby, but also to prevent the depleting wild life resource he established Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve in 1987 AD. King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation as a memorial to his father, with the then prince Gyanendra as the chairman, was also established in 1990. With the establishment of Mahendra trust, he declared Annapurna Conservation Area.

Moreover, with his efforts, Nepal was able to enlist Sagarmatha National Park in 1979 and Chitwan National Park in 1984 into the UNESCO World heritage sites. Similarly, monument zones such as the Durbar squares of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur and religious sites such as Swayambhunath, Boudhanath, Pashupatinath Temple and Changu Narayan was also enlisted in 1979.

=== Economic reforms ===

Focusing on sustainability and environmental conservation, on , trolley bus system was established in Nepal from the aid of People&#x27;s Republic of China. He followed in the path of his father to establish industrial estates by establishing Nepalgunj Industrial Area(1973), Pokhara Industrial Area(1974), Butwal Industrial Area(1976), Bhaktapur Industrial Area(1979), Dhankuta Industrial Area(1980), Birendranagar Industrial Area(1981), Gajendranarayan Industrial Area(1986) respectively.

Birendra is initially credited for devising the plan of Melamchi water project to Kathmandu. Gorakhali Tires Industries, Udayapur Cement Industries Limited, Nepal Metal company, Nepal Pharmaceuticals were all established during his time. King Birendra, was the patron of Pashupati Area Development Trust. In April 1979, Nepal Oriental Magnesite factory was established with a joint investment of Nepal government and Orissa Industries, India at Lakuri Danda in Dolakha District with the objective of producing dead burnt magnesite and talc powder. In 1983 he was able to establish a Nepal-Pakistan Joint Economic Commission bringing in significant foreign investments in the country.

A 60 Megawatt hydropower project at Kulekhani began operation in 1982 with economic aid from the World Bank, Kuwait, and Japan.

TU Teaching Hospital was established in 1982 with the economic support from Japan International Cooperation Agency. Nardevi Ayurvedic Hospital was established in 1974. Nepal Police Hospital was established by the king on the 27th of Chaitra, 2040 BS with an intention to provide free health services to in- service policemen and, their families.

He established Securities Exchange Center Ltd in 1976 to manage, promote and support the growth of trade of stocks and capitals in the nation. This center was later developed to what we know today as Nepal Stock Exchange.

He is also credited for establishing the first television channel of Nepal Nepal Television in 1984 which started its first channel in 1985 with French aid. Due to these economic reforms, by 1986, there were 2,054 industrial establishments employing about 125 thousand workers in the nation. By 1990, reach of people for television meant that video rental services and satellite dishes were commonly available.

King Birendra in the advice and consent of Rastriya Panchayat in 1986 established Mahendra Sanskrit University to manage Sanskrit education in Nepal in Dang which at the time of its commencement was the second university of the country.

=== Roads and transportation ===
Various Studies in 1972 showed that building road connectivity in hilly and rural areas were more expensive than air connectivity. So, the then government took the policy of connecting rural areas with airports and build roads only when there was a high amount of traffic flow. Under this policy, Baglung Airport (Balewa Airport), Dhorpatan Airport, Mahendranagar Airport and Rukum Chaurjahari Airport was established in the year 1973. Sanphebagar airport was established in 1975. Simikot Airport was established on 18 March 1977, Dolpa Airport, was established in 1978 and Ramechhap airport in 1979. Doti Airport, also known as Silgadhi Airport was established in 1973 with the blacktopped runway. Talcha Airport, also known as Rara Airport was built in 1975.Taplejung Airport located in Phungling, also called Suketar Airport, Jiri Airport and Phaplu Airport and Bajhang Airport was built in 1976. Rolpa Airport in 1980, Manang Airport in 1981, Bajura airport in 1984 and Darchula Airport in 1986.

Similarly, The Lamosangu-Jiri road leading to Solukhumbu was commissioned in 1985 with Swiss government aid.

=== Promotion of agriculture ===
The government, during Birendra&#x27;s reign, focused highly on agriculture promotion. As a result, almost 90% of the population was directly or indirectly involved in agriculture by 1990. Bhrikuti Pulp and Paper was established in 1985 under the Companies Act 2021 (Bikram Sambat) with support from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Increase in agricultural lands and agricultural workforce provided increased supplies of food, resulting in better nutrition. Corn production was increased to over 1 million tons in 1991 from 500,000 tons in 1961. Lumbini Sugar Mills at Sunwal, Nawalparasi was built with the technical assistance from China in 1982. The establishment of Gorakhali rubber Industries led to the cultivation of rubber for the first time in Jhapa, Illam and many other places of eastern Nepal. Similarly. establishment of agriculture based industries such as Bhrikuti Pulp and Paper, Hetauda Textile and huge number of carpet and garment industry were established to convert raw agricultural produce which contributed greatly to the economy.

=== Political achievements ===

During the reign of King Birendra, referendum was held in 2037 BS for democracy wherein options were a multi-party system or a Panchayati system. During the Panchayat era and after the national referendum, he divided the nation into 5 development regions in order to create balanced development, and visited each division once a year; the visits were discontinued after 1990 democracy movement.

Despite previously being an autocratic rule and constant pressure from the supporters and royal members, the king always played the role of constitutional monarch by the book and never overstepped his boundaries. King Birendra was always there when there was some political crisis in the nation. Mid-term elections, 2051 and General Election, 2056 can be attributed to his good governance. The King regularly asked the Supreme Court for its advice on any political matters that could concern the constitution so that he would never overstep the boundaries of the constitution. He created a culture where the king and prime minister would meet every Thursday at his palace to discuss matters of state.

=== Social reforms ===
Recognizing low literacy levels as the main hindrance to national progress, King Birendra made development of education system his national priority. The five year plan starting from 1971 was mainly focused in building new educational institutions and upgrading the efficiency of the current education system. On the auspicious occasion of his coronation, King Birendra declared primary education to be free for all Nepalese citizens. Similarly, in 1978 with a royal approval all educational material started to be distributed free of costs to educational institutions. King Birendra became the patron of Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology which worked in the field of developing science and technology in the nation. He established Mahendra Sanskrit University in 1986 to preserve the language and culture in the region. Dowry system was criminalized in Nepal in 1976 under the Social Practices Reform Act (2033 B.S). Under the five year plan, King Birendra started the policy of National Service which required the post-graduate students to contribute their one-year of service to the development works in the rural areas. He initiated the process of preserving the history by establishing Natural History Museum in 1975. On 22 September 1976 he enacted Narcotic Drugs (Control) Act, 2033 prohibiting the trade, smuggling or any kind of drug trafficking in the country.

=== Development policy ===
Birendra took the policy of road development according to the population and daily road traffic and connecting the rural areas with airports. He restructured many governmental organization for the purpose of achieving developmental goals. He stressed roadbuilding, sanitation and scientific as well as technical trainings. A comprehensive study performed regarding the central planning agency triggered the restructuring of the National Planning Commission in 1972 and minor changes in 1987. The government policy focused mainly on environment conservation, agriculture and education.

== Criticism ==
=== Stagnant economy ===
Though King Birendra is remembered as a development-friendly king, he is also criticized for his inability to drive the country towards rapid development efforts like his father King Mahendra. He had the political will but simply not the skill through which development efforts could be rapidly gained. His policy of sustainable development, shown by his nature conservation efforts, culture, and history became hindrances for economic development. The Panchayat regime created a stagnant economy during his reign as an autocratic ruler.

=== Administrative failure ===
Historians point out that the Panchayat Regime under King Birendra was a failure. He was not able to bring in much direct foreign investment during his reign, and all the programs he brought, or all the reforms he made were the continuation of his father&#x27;s legacy. He restructured various organization previously established by his father, and implemented various development plan envisioned by his father.

=== Failed development efforts ===
Birendra restructured various organization and brought many development plans, but his development efforts were mostly a failure; which hindered any radical change in the country. Many airports and roads built during his era were rarely used, and eventually had to be closed down. Moreover, the reason the newly-built roads were rarely used was due to very low vehicle ownership or access to vehicles; so rarely contributing to economic development.

=== Fall of the Panchayat system ===
Some historians and anti-democrats blame Birendra solely for the fall of Panchayat regime. During the 1980s, the restraints that he had eased against political organizations provided a breeding ground for political parties which had previously been powerless and virtually non-existent until then.

== Personality ==
From a very young age, Birendra was described by his Eton teachers as a kind prince. He was remembered by his Eton classmates as a &quot;very, very nice bloke who was embarrassed when his full title was read out at the school assembly.&quot; Very famous Nepalese media personality, Neer Shah describe Birendra as kind and development loving king. Royalist around the king and various scholars define him as a simple king who was able to listen to others view. They also criticize him for his weakness of not being able to deny the requests of people around him and his habit to act like a clerk and work himself rather than order others.

Birendra allowed the 2036 B.S. &quot;Janmat Sangraha&quot; (1980 Referendum) which was considered a move towards democracy. However, the leaders advocating for democracy and historians have claimed that the referendum was rigged. After People&#x27;s Movement I that resulted in few hundred deaths, he established a constitutional monarchy in Nepal.

Some historians have speculated that Birendra&#x27;s democratic views and simple nature may have led to the success of the People&#x27;s Movement I (1990). He is credited for introducing SAARC in Asia in order to strengthen the foreign relations of Nepal with the other South Asian countries.

== Memorial ==
Many structures, institutions and honors have been built in the memory of King Birendra. Monuments erected in his name were renamed after the restoration of the parliament in 2063 BS and the end of the monarchy in 2065 BS. After the political changes of 2063 BS, an attempt was made to rename the highway built in the name of the king as Lok Marg.

<text>Michael Sean Redmond (マイケル・レドモンド, born May 25, 1963) is an American-born professional Go player. He is one of only a few such players, as Go is not as widespread or developed outside of China, South Korea and Japan. He is the only Westerner to reach the highest grade of 9-dan.

== Biography ==
Michael Redmond was born in 1963 in Santa Barbara, California, and began playing Go at age 11. At 14, he moved to Japan and became an insei (Go apprentice) at the Nihon Ki-in, one of the two major Japanese Go associations. He was promoted to professional 1 dan at age 18, and 2 dan the same year. He was promoted to 5 dan in 1985; 8 dan in 1996; and 9 dan in 2000, becoming the first Western Go professional to reach 9 dan.

Redmond has not won any tournament titles but has come close. He was runner-up in the Shinjin-O, Kisei 7 dan section, and NEC Shun-Ei competitions in the early 1990s. He was also a quarter-finalist in the Fujitsu Cup and Tong Yang Cup. Currently, he is a celebrated commentator for the NHK channel. In 2005, he was voted &quot;Best Commentator&quot; for the NHK channel, over Ishida Yoshio.

<doc id="313173" wikidata="Q1313706" url="?curid=313173" title="Personal exemption">
<text>Under United States tax law, a personal exemption is an amount that a resident taxpayer is entitled to claim as a tax deduction against personal income in calculating taxable income and consequently federal income tax. In 2017, the personal exemption amount was $4,050, though the exemption is subject to phase-out limitations. The personal exemption amount is adjusted each year for inflation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates personal exemptions for tax years 2018 through 2025.

The exemption is composed of personal exemptions for the individual taxpayer and, as appropriate, the taxpayer&#x27;s spouse and dependents, as provided in Internal Revenue Code at .

== Overview ==
Section 151 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted in August 1954, and provided for deductions equal to the &quot;personal exemption&quot; amount in computing taxable income. The exemption was intended to insulate from taxation the minimal amount of income someone would need receive to live at a subsistence level (i.e., enough income for food, clothes, shelter, etc.). In addition to personal exemptions, taxpayers may claim other deductions that further reduce the level of income subject to taxation.

Generally speaking, for tax years prior to 2018, a personal exemption can be claimed by the taxpayer and qualifying dependents. A personal exemption may also be claimed for a spouse if (1) the couple files separately, (2) the spouse has no gross income, and (3) the spouse is not the dependent of another, §151(b). For taxpayers filing a joint return with a spouse, the Treasury Regulations allow two personal exemptions as well.

If a taxpayer could be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer (regardless of whether anyone actually claims them), he or she cannot claim a personal exemption for himself or herself.

In computing taxable income, taxpayers may claim all personal exemptions for which they are eligible under §151, and deduct that amount from the adjusted gross income (AGI).

==Phase-out==
The personal exemptions begin to phase out when AGI exceeds $309,900 for 2017 joint tax returns and $258,250 for 2017 single tax returns. Each tax exemption is reduced by 2% for each $2,500 by which a taxpayer&#x27;s AGI exceeds the threshold amount until the benefit of all personal exemptions is eliminated.

In 2017, the personal exemption amount was $4,050, and it began to phase out at, and reached the maximum phaseout amount after, the following adjusted gross income amounts:

==Dependent requirement==
Section 152 of the code contains nuanced requirements that must be met before a taxpayer can claim another as a dependent for personal exemption purposes. The general rule is that a personal exemption may be taken for a dependent that is either a qualifying child or a qualifying relative. § 152(a). However, there are several exceptions to this rule.

Taxpayers who are claimed as dependents of others cannot themselves claim personal exemptions for their qualifying dependents. § 152(b)(1). Married individuals who file joint returns cannot also be claimed as dependents of another taxpayer. § 152(b)(2). Non-U.S.-Citizens or nationals of other countries cannot be claimed as dependents unless they also reside in the U.S. or in contiguous countries. § 152(b)(3). However, taxpayers who are also U.S. citizens or nationals may claim as a dependent any child who shares the taxpayer&#x27;s abode and is a member of the taxpayer&#x27;s household. &quot;Id.&quot;

===Qualifying children as dependents===
Qualifying children must first be &quot;children&quot; in the sense of § 152(f)(1). The term &quot;children&quot; includes adopted children, children placed for adoption, stepchildren, and foster children. Id. Qualifying children must have the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer for more than one-half of the year and must not have provided more than one-half of their own support. 
§ 152(c)(1). They can include a taxpayer&#x27;s children, a taxpayer&#x27;s siblings, half-siblings, or step siblings, or the descendants of a taxpayer&#x27;s children, siblings, half-siblings, or step siblings. §§ 152(c)(2), (f)(4). They may not have reached the age of 19 by the close of the year, unless they are students, in which case they must not have reached the age of 24, or unless they are permanently and totally disabled. § 152(c)(3).

A child cannot qualify as a dependent on more than one tax return, so the code has a set of rules to prevent this from happening. § 152(c)(4). The code first attempts to break the tie by limiting eligible taxpayers to the child&#x27;s parents, followed by the contending non-parental taxpayer with the highest adjusted gross income. &quot;Id.&quot; If more than one parent attempts to claim the child and they do not file a joint return, the code first attempts to break the tie in favor of the parent with whom the child resided longest during the taxable year. &quot;Id.&quot; If that does not break the tie, the parent with the highest adjusted gross income wins the right to claim the child as a dependent. &quot;Id.&quot;

For the treatment of children of divorced parents, see § 152(e). For a case in which children are missing and presumed kidnapped, see § 152(f)(6)...

===Other qualifying relatives as dependents===
A qualifying relative cannot be the qualifying child of any taxpayer. § 152(d)(1). The individual must have gross income less than the amount of the personal exemption. &quot;Id.&quot; The taxpayer must have provided over one-half of the individual&#x27;s support. &quot;Id.&quot;

The allowable relationships between the taxpayer and the qualifying relative are almost innumerable, but under no circumstances can the relationship be one that violates local law. §§ 152(d)(2), (f)(3). Included are children (in the broad sense of § 152(f)(1)), descendants of children, siblings, half-siblings, step-siblings, father, mother, ancestors of parents, stepparents, nieces, nephews, various in-laws, or any other non-spousal individual sharing the taxpayer&#x27;s abode and household. § 152(d)(2).

Special rules dealing with multiple support agreements, handicapped dependents, and child support are detailed at § 152(d)(3)-(5).

==History==
The personal exemption amount in 1894 was $4,000 ($109,277 in 2016 dollars). The income tax enacted in 1894 was declared unconstitutional in 1895. The income tax law in its modern form—which began in the year 1913—included a provision for a personal exemption amount of $3,000 ($71,764 in 2016 dollars), or $4,000 for married couples. ($95,686 in 2016 dollars)

Over time the amount of the exemption has increased and decreased depending on political policy and the need for tax revenue. Since the Depression, the exemption has increased steadily, but not enough to keep up with inflation. Despite the intent of the exemption, the amounts are also less than half of the poverty line.

The exemption amounts for years 1987 through 2018 are as shown at right.

<text>A go apprentice is a student learning to play Go at an institution, typically with the aim of becoming a professional player. In Japan, such a student is called an &quot;insei&quot; (literally, &quot;institution student&quot;). Institutions for insei include the Nihon Ki-in (Japanese Go Association) and the Kansai Ki-in (Kansai Go Association). The equivalent of Go insei in Korea is &quot;Yeon gu saeng&quot; (), read &quot;Ken kyū sei&quot; in Japanese and &quot;Yán jiū shēng&quot; (, also meaning &quot;graduate student&quot;) in Chinese.

== Qualifications and study ==
In Japan, once a year 3 or 4 apprentices who qualify in a yearly tournament become professional players. 

East Asian players are required to become a professional before the age of 18 while studying as insei, but foreigners have the chance up to the age of about 30.

To become an insei, a person requires a professional to sponsor them, and an application to the Nihon Ki-in. There is no official way to contact a professional for sponsorship.

While insei, many people live with their professional sponsor, who tutors and supports them. Some insei just visit their professional sponsor several times a week. The professional sponsor acts as a mentor for the insei.
