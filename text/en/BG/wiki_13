==History==

===Early history===
====Baker Field====
A 1910 newspaper article cited &quot;a site near Scottsville Road&quot;, along with the Baker Farm in Genesee Valley Park, as possible locations for &quot;airships&quot; to fly from Rochester to Toronto. The Baker Farm was located south of the original Genesee Valley Park, and was donated to the Parks Department of the City of Rochester in 1908. The golf course at Genesee Valley Park was extended to include the Baker Farm in 1914. During World War I, the Baker Farm area of the park, renamed &quot;Baker Field&quot;, was used for military purposes. The United States School of Aerial Photography had been created at Kodak Park in Rochester, and Baker Field was the airfield associated with the project. Military use of the field ceased in 1918. Baker Field continued to be used as an airfield for a year or two thereafter, but flood conditions made it unsuitable for airfield use in the long run. Britton Field, located just west of Baker Field, became the primary airport for the Rochester area.

====Britton Field====
The site of the Greater Rochester International Airport, originally known as Britton Field, was used for aviation purposes as early as 1919. The Rochester Aircraft Corporation launched its first passenger flight from Britton Field August 18, 1919. The Curtiss JN-4 was piloted by Earl F. Beers. At the time, the only way to get to the field was either by car or by taking the Genesee Street trolley line to the end, and walking the remaining distance. Beers, a Rochester aviation pioneer, urged the local government to purchase Britton Field for a municipal airport. In 1919, Beers offered passenger flights out of Britton Field, charging $1.00 per minute.

Britton Field hosted the United States Flying Circus, consisting of six planes, in September 1919. Dozens of planes landed in Britton Field as part of an aviation race across the United States and back again. The race was won by Lt. B. W. Maynard, &quot;The Flying Parson&quot;, who arrived in Rochester, from Buffalo, at 10:30 AM October 18, 1919. His flight from Buffalo&#x27;s Curtiss Field to Britton Field, a distance of 70 miles, in 22 minutes. He continued to Binghamton before finishing the race at Mineola at 1:50 PM that afternoon. Britton Field was the scene of more competition when a pair of Rochester fliers and two from Syracuse raced between the two cities later in 1919, in a contest sponsored by the Rochester Aero Club and the Syracuse Aero Club. The Rochester newspaper reported that the two Rochester planes beat the combined flying time of the Syracuse pair by 15 seconds.

Purchase of the field as a &quot;municipal aviation station&quot; was authorized by the Rochester City Council in December 1919 The Rochester Aircraft Corporation proposed passenger service out of Britton Field across Lake Ontario to Toronto in 1920. &quot;Young&quot; Sparks, of Bradford, PA., demonstrated the early art of parachuting, by leaping from a plane from 2,100 feet, in an aerial field day at Britton Field in 1921. The United States Army considered Britton Field as a possible site for an airship mooring mast in 1924.

In the 1920s Eastman Kodak Company and the United States Army used Britton Field as landing field for the testing of Kodak&#x27;s aerial photography experiments. The Fokker monoplane &quot;Josephine Ford&quot;, flown by Commander Richard Byrd over the North Pole, was exhibited at Britton Field in October 1926, part of a nationwide tour intended to stimulate interest in aviation. During the Rochester exhibition, an unlicensed pilot, Charles Teleska, crashed his own plane.

The Colonial Air Transport Company, forerunner to American Airlines, developed plans in 1926 to run daytime flights from Boston to Chicago, stopping at Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, and Cleveland. An intersecting route from New York City to Montreal would cross at Albany, allowing for passenger transfers. The new route would carry passengers, mail and merchandise. Night flights were planned as soon as lighted fields were available. The Rochester Flying Club was formed that Fall, intending to keep Britton Field open to all aviation, and to start construction of a hangar and other improvements.

Charles Lindbergh flew &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; into Britton Field July 29, 1927, as part of an air tour of New York State. He was greeted by 75,000, according to newspaper reports. He stayed an hour and proceeded on to Buffalo. In the summer of 1927, the Rochester Community Players used Britton Field as one of the backdrops of their silent movie, &quot;Fly Low Jack and The Game&quot;. The movie was written, directed, acted and produced by amateurs of the theater company, showcasing the new Cine-Kodak 16mm home movie system.

The first woman in Western New York to receive a pilot&#x27;s license, Geraldine Grey of Buffalo, trained at Britton Field under the direction of William Dunlap in 1928.

===Rochester Municipal Airport===
The modern era of the Greater Rochester International Airport began in 1927, with the construction of Hangar No. 1 on a patch of land south of Rochester on Scottsville Road. The first scheduled passenger flights between New York City and Rochester were made that year. In 1928, the name was changed to Rochester Municipal Airport and more construction was completed, including improvements to the runways and drainage system, and Hangar No. 2. After the Second World War the airport saw a period of expansion as passenger volume, frequency of flights, and civilian pilot training increased. A flight training school, with nearly 1,000 students, was created.

On January 1, 1948, Monroe County took possession and control of the airport. The county made numerous improvements, including an instrumental runway long, an extension of the north–south runway from to , and administration facilities on Brooks Avenue.

===1953–1992 terminal===
A new red-brick, single-level passenger terminal was opened on Brooks Avenue in 1953. It was expanded substantially in 1963, and expanded again in 1978 and 1980. The building had only one floor, until a small second floor was added for administrative offices as part of the 1980 expansion. At this time the airport was &quot;Rochester Monroe County Airport.&quot;

After the 1963 expansion gave it its final layout, the terminal had ten gates in two concourses. A small three-gate concourse at the east end served American Airlines, and a longer, angled concourse at the west end served Mohawk Airlines (four gates on the east side) and United Airlines (three gates on the west side).

Jet service began ROC in 1965 on American Airlines Boeing 727s, but the two longest runways, 10–28 () and 1–19 () were short for jets. In 1967 Monroe County built runway 4–22, initially and extended in 1969 to (bypassing the threshold required for CAT III certification). 10–28 is still the crosswind runway. Runway 7–25, long, is used by smaller aircraft.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s there was talk of building a Rochester-Buffalo airport in southeastern Niagara County, which would have taken over passenger traffic from Rochester-Monroe County and Greater Buffalo International Airport airports. This was never built.

The first jetways were added to gates 1 and 3 by American in 1977. As part of the 1978 expansion, new lounge space was built for Allegheny Airlines (successor to Mohawk) with three jetways. In about 1986 the airline (by then renamed USAir) added a fourth jetway. The 1980 expansion included two new lounge areas for United, each of which had one jetway. In 1987, Piedmont Airlines, which had taken over the United lounge closest to the terminal, added a second jetway to it. In about 1985, USAir built an expansion to the end of the main concourse to house a USAir Club.

The large new low-fare carrier People Express Airlines arrived at the airport in 1985. There was not room for them inside the terminal. A small ticket counter was built in office space in the northwest corner of the terminal, and a wooden peaked-roof shed was built on to house their outbound-baggage area, departure lounge, and baggage claim. No jetway was added. People&#x27;s effect on fares was dramatic; ROC&#x27;s enplanements increased 38% in 1985. When Continental Airlines took over People in 1987, they moved operations into the main terminal and shared gate space with American. The shed was removed.

In the mid-1980s, Monroe County Legislator Van Buren N. Hansford, Sr. (R-Pittsford) introduced successful legislation to have the airport&#x27;s name changed to &quot;Greater Rochester International Airport.&quot; By the end of the 1980s, The New York Air National Guard constructed a small hangar and office facility, and apron space, on the south side of the airport near the control tower. This facility has since been expanded.

===Present terminal building===

==== 1988-1992 expansion project: new terminal ====
The terminal was outgrown by the mid-1980s, and debate began about expanding the airport. In 1985, the administration of Monroe County Executive Lucien A. Morin (R) proposed a complicated terminal expansion that would have had baggage claim carousels across the driveway in a separate building, which tugs would have reached by a tunnel, and passengers would have reached by second-floor bridge corridors.

The County got as far as building temporary parking lots to the west and closing the main parking lots to begin construction on a garage. However, in 1988 the new County Executive, Thomas R. Frey (D) and the County Legislature had doubts about the cost of the project, and it was abandoned before construction started in earnest.

In 1988 Monroe County approved a $109 million plan to replace the terminal with an entirely new two-level facility with a second-level approach road and parking garage. The new facilities were built in stages on the exact site, between 1989 and 1992 and designed by HNTB and built by Wilmorite, Inc. Ticketing and departures are on the second floor, and baggage claim and ground transportation is on the first floor. The County Legislature authorized the creation of a &quot;Monroe County Airport Authority&quot; to issue the bonds for the construction.

This terminal has two angled concourses, each with 11 gates. Gate assignments are listed below. The eastern or B concourse opened in summer 1990. The eastern half of the main terminal opened in 1991. The western half of the main terminal, western or A concourse, and garage, all opened in 1992. A series of temporary prefabricated buildings were used to provide gate space and baggage claim space during the construction.

==== 2006-2008 terminal improvements ====
In 2006, Monroe County consolidated the separate security checkpoints at each concourse, to one central security checkpoint. Monroe County argued that this arrangement, although it would close the terminal&#x27;s large concessions atrium and airfield views to non-passengers, would be more efficient and save money. The county replaced the lost public airfield view with a new viewing area at the west end of the terminal.

In 2008, renovations were undertaken to replace floors, carpets, and seating in the concourses, move explosives-scanning equipment from the ticketing lobby to the outbound baggage room, and replace T-shaped baggage claim carousels with four 360-degree walk-around carousels, which receive luggage from belts through the ceiling. These projects were completed by late 2009.

In January 2009, the airport began work on an extension of the three-story parking garage to the west, for additional capacity. By early 2010, that project was completed.

==== 2016-2018 terminal renovations ====

The concrete road decking of the departures level roadway was closed and repaired from April to July 2016. The Airport won the Governor Cuomo&#x27;s Upstate Airport Economic and Revitalization Competition (UAERC) in 2016 and received nearly $40 million, for use to adapt and enhance the airport&#x27;s facilities. A $54 million project was subsequently announced to create a high-tech smart facility that best serves the business and economic needs, while reducing barriers for passengers with disabilities, which broke ground in the spring of 2017. The UAERC sums were used to pay for a substantial portion of the project, with bonds and airport fees paying for remaining costs. By the fall, the total cost had ballooned to $79 million.

The security checkpoint was enlarged, now including two dedicated TSA PreCheck lanes in addition to four general lanes. A consolidated exit passageway, leading from the secure Food Court to non-secure Baggage Claim, eliminated two previous exits at either end of the concourse. The Food Court was renovated and revamped with new restaurants and additional seating. Bathrooms, interior lighting in addition to accessibility services and way-finding were overhauled throughout the terminal.

A new cell-phone lot was built with flight-display information and an electric vehicle charging station, and is located off the airport roadway, now before the terminal building instead of after. A canopy added over the departures-level roadway reduces winter maintenance costs, and features solar panels, colorful aesthetic lighting, and rainwater storage capabilities. The project was completed in October 2018.

=== Airport events at-large ===
Southwest Airlines replaced AirTran&#x27;s service at the airport after its acquisition by the airline in 2013.

In 2014, New York State Police established a base for its aviation unit at the Monroe County Regional Traffic Operations Center on airport property, already a station for that agency. At least two helicopters, previously based out of Batavia and Syracuse, were moved to consolidate operations and reduce costs. This unit services Western and Central New York, including Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.

Allegiant Air started limited service out of Rochester, with flights to Orlando-Sanford that same year.

The Clock of Nations, previously at Midtown Plaza prior to 2007, was restored and moved to the airport Food Court in 2009. Planned to stay temporarily — until the clock&#x27;s intended permanent home at the new Golisano Children&#x27;s Hospital building was completed in 2014 — the hospital early in the design process opted to decline housing it, allotting the airport as an indefinite residence. It remained on display until 2017, before being disassembled and placed into storage before renovations started. The Clock of Nations will not be placed back in the terminal, as it can no longer occupy its previous location because of changes to the terminal layout. As of 2020, Monroe County has no plans for the clock&#x27;s future home, which remains in storage.

In October 2018, Air Canada ended its service to Rochester from Toronto, leaving the airport without any international flights.

In May 2021, Frontier Airlines started new service to Orlando from Rochester.

=== Renaming efforts ===

An online petition was started in July 2020 to rename the airport after Frederick Douglass, possibly to &quot;Frederick Douglass International Airport&quot;. Soon after, County Executive Adam Bello said that Monroe County will begin to work with stakeholders - the FAA, Monroe County Legislature, among others - to examine and study a potential name change. Douglass lived in Rochester for much of his adult life and is buried at Mt. Hope Cemetery.

On August 12, 2020, Monroe County legislators confirmed that the airport would be renamed in honor of Douglass.

==Airfield==
The airport covers at an elevation of . It has three runways - a primary runway, a general aviation runway, and a crosswinds runway:

* 4/22: , asphalt
* 7/25: , asphalt
* 10/28: , asphalt

Runways 4, 22 and 28 have Instrument Landing System (ILS); runway 4 has a Category II ILS.

In 2008 the airport completed two service roads around the end of Runway 28, near Interstate 390, in tunnels. The ground was graded upwards beyond the end of the runway to cover the tunnels. Earlier in the decade, a overrun area was added to the east (10) end of this runway, adjacent to railroad tracks and housing. An engineered materials arrestor system (EMAS) of about was added to this extension. The EMAS consists of soft rubberized concrete into which an overrunning aircraft&#x27;s wheels can sink, and the aircraft may be stopped safely before it veers onto the grass.

==Movements==
In 2017 the airport had 87,261 aircraft operations, average 239 per day: 44% general aviation, 26% air carrier, 26% air taxi and 3% military. 86 aircraft are based at the airport: 48 single engine, 10 multi-engine, 17 jet and 11 military.

==Terminal==
The Greater Rochester International Airport consists of a main terminal building with two angled concourses with 22 total passenger gates. The departures level includes a ticketing hall, a six lane security checkpoint, post-security food court and two passenger concourses. The arrivals level has four baggage claim carousels, airline baggage offices, visitor information and car rental offices. A three-level parking garage, designated for long-term parking and rental cars, sits across the roadway from the terminal building. Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites has an on-site hotel across the street from the terminal, just east of the parking garage.

JetBlue, Spirit, American, Avelo and Southwest occupy Concourse A (also called Frederick Douglass Concourse) with gates A1-A11. United, Delta and Allegiant are in Concourse B (also known as Susan B. Anthony Concourse) with gates B1-B10.

*Allegheny Airlines Flight 453 crash-landed on July 9, 1978, while arriving from Boston Logan International Airport. The BAC-111 aircraft was carrying 77 people. According to the NTSB report, the flight landed on Runway 28 at too high a speed, but with capability to reject the landing. The pilots chose to continue the landing, the aircraft skidded off the end of the runway, and its landing gear was sheared off by a ditch. There were no fatalities. The aircraft was written off.

*On December 22, 1984, a Cessna 402B operated by Falcon Air, N8064Q, was destroyed while returning to land after a cargo door had opened during takeoff. The pilot was killed, no passengers were aboard. The NTSB listed the cause of the accident as pilot error including inadequate pre-flight planning, failure to maintain airspeed, pilot attentiveness, and inability to recognize and avoid stall. Contributing factors included high wind shear conditions and the baggage door opening upon takeoff.
*On November 14, 2002, a Cessna 210L, N2444S, was destroyed during a forced landing and collision with terrain while on approach to land. The accident site was 1 mile east of the airport .

<text>PL/C is an instructional dialect of the programming language PL/I, developed at the Department of Computer Science of Cornell University in the early 1970s in an effort headed by Professor Richard W. Conway and graduate student Thomas R. Wilcox. PL/C was developed with the specific goal of being used for teaching programming. The PL/C compiler, which implemented almost all of the large PL/I language, had the unusual capability of never failing to compile a program, through the use of extensive automatic correction of many syntax errors and by converting any remaining syntax errors to output statements. This was important because, at the time, students submitted their programs on 
IBM punch cards and might not get their output back for several hours. Over 250 other universities adopted PL/C; as one late-1970s textbook on PL/I noted, &quot;PL/C ... the compiler for PL/I developed at Cornell University ... is widely used in teaching programming.&quot; Similarly, a mid-late-1970s survey of programming languages said that &quot;PL/C is a widely used dialect of PL/I.&quot;

== Origins and rationale ==
Work on this project was based on a prior Cornell compiler for the programming language CUPL, which in turn was influenced by the earlier Cornell language implementation CORC. Both of these were small, very restricted languages intended for the teaching of beginning programming. CORC had been used at Cornell from 1962 to 1966 and CUPL from 1965 to 1969. Conway&#x27;s group had been involved in the development of both of those efforts, each of which attempted automatic repair of source code errors.
As the 1970s began, Cornell was attempting to find a teaching language that had general commercial acceptance but also contained modern language features. As another Cornell computer science professor, David Gries, wrote at the time, the first criterion effectively eliminated the ALGOL family of languages and the second criteria argued against FORTRAN and BASIC (with COBOL not even being considered); thus, they chose PL/I. While PL/I did have a foothold in educational use, the decision went against the grain of most universities, where one survey found that some 70 percent of American college students were being taught with FORTRAN. However, Cornell was intent on having a language useful for showing computer science principles and best engineering practices and through which methods such as structured programming and stepwise refinement could be taught, and PL/I was a more expressive vehicle for that than FORTRAN.

For educational institutions that did choose to use the language, the production IBM PL/I F compiler then available was much too slow, in both compile time and execution time, for its use to be practical for student programs. A similar situation existed for FORTRAN, where the IBM FORTRAN IV G compiler was too slow and the University of Waterloo&#x27;s WATFOR implementation had become a very popular alternate solution. So there was an opening for a student compiler for PL/I; indeed, IBM recognized this and contacted Cornell and suggested they make a &#x27;WATFOR for PL/I&#x27;. Indeed, this simile would be made explicit; as one university would explain to their computer center users, &quot;PL/C is to PL/I what WATFOR is to FORTRAN IV, a fast compile-and-go system with some batching capabilities intended primarily for student use.&quot;
IBM supplied some of the funding for the initial PL/C development effort, which took place during 1968 and 1969, with the &quot;C&quot; in the name standing for Cornell. PL/C began being used on a regular basis in September 1970.

== Dialect and features ==
PL/C, a large subset of PL/I, eliminated a few of the more complex features of PL/I – record I/O, list processing, multitasking, and the compile-time preprocessor. It added extensive debugging and error recovery facilities. PL/C was upwardly compatible with PL/I, meaning that a program that runs without error under the PL/C compiler should run under PL/I and produce the same results. The only exception is if certain incompatible diagnostic features of PL/C were used. The PL/C compiler had the unusual capability of never failing to compile any program, through the use of extensive automatic correction of many syntax errors and by converting any remaining syntax errors to output statements.

PL/C provided extensions to PL/I&#x27;s own codice_1 facility for flow tracing, and additionally provided new facilities, such as the codice_2 and codice_3 statements for printing the values of every scalar and every array variable at that point in the program. PL/C also provided pseudo-comments, which could be used to conditionally turn on code based on options supplied in the PL/C job control card:

The comments value shown here would result in the first codice_4 statement being &quot;uncommented&quot; and invoked during the run, while the second one whose number did not match would still be a comment. Pseudo-comments also provided a way to use PL/C-specific statements in an upwardly compatible way with PL/I, as in the second case, since the PL/I compiler would see them as comments only.

PL/C handles floating point arithmetic by computing all single-precision values as double precision, which can complicate attempts by the programmer to validate rounding behavior of particular computations.

A simple example of PL/C&#x27;s error repair has been presented as:

While many cases such as this one can be successfully repaired, there are also cases where the repair does not achieve what the programmer likely intended.

There were several other education-related PL/I compilers, including PLAGO from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and SP/k from the University of Toronto, however they tended to use much more restricted subsets of PL/I, whereas PL/C supported almost the entire language. And PL/C was the only PL/I educational dialect mentioned in languages expert Jean E. Sammet&#x27;s extensive survey of programming languages in use for 1976–77.

== Design and implementation ==
The implementation of the PL/C compiler itself was done in IBM 360 Assembly Language, with a heavy use of assembly language macros. It was done as a three-pass compiler, with the first pass doing syntax analysis and error correction of syntactical mistakes, the second pass doing semantic analysis and further error correction, and the third pass doing code generation. PL/C needed to avoid the longstanding problem of &quot;cascading diagnostics&quot;, wherein one error is internally but often mistakenly &quot;fixed&quot; by the compiler, resulting in a secondary, tertiary and additional series of unhelpful error messages. The design of the intermediate language used between the passes and of the accompanying symbol table was tailored towards, and key to the achievement of, the error-repair and diagnostic reporting capabilities of PL/C. While a number of these techniques dated from the Cornell CORC and CUPL efforts, here they were being used for the first time on large programming language with a full set of commercial-grade features. This was especially notable given that the PL/I language was notoriously challenging for compilers to deal with.

The compilation speed of PL/C was quite good – some 10,000–20,000 sources lines of code per minute on an IBM System/360 Model 65. The work done on PL/C was described in a paper presented at an AFIPS joint conference in Spring 1971. More prominent was the paper &quot;Design and Implementation of a Diagnostic Compiler for PL/I&quot; by Conway and Wilcox, published in the March 1973 issue of the flagship journal &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;, which gave the project considerable visibility within the computer science world.

PL/C was implemented as a compile and go system, similar to WATFOR. It ran on the IBM System/360 and System/370 under OS and HASP. As such, it was designed to run within a 128K byte partition, where the PL/C software and the generated object code took a maximum of 100K bytes. Error correction was attempted at runtime as well, with the PL/C execution supervisor trapping or otherwise detecting use of uninitialized variables, division by zero, out-of-range array indexes, and the like, by issuing a diagnostic and making some adjustment to allow the program to keep running. Overall, use of PL/C significantly reduced the severity of the wait-times-for-batch-runs problem (although Cornell itself developed a job entry system for turning around most student batch jobs very quickly).
== Use and distribution ==
As soon as it was ready, PL/C was distributed beyond Cornell itself, in the form of magnetic tapes sent to interested parties. For instance, PL/C was first used at the University of Michigan in the Fall 1970 semester. The PL/C project was considered a research effort, not a commercial endeavor; however, those installations who wanted to use PL/C were asked to pay a &quot;research grant&quot; in exchange. This amount was $1,800 as of 1972, and had risen to $2,400 by 1976. Cornell&#x27;s further development work on PL/C was partly funded by these payments.

PL/C quickly became the most popular of any education version of PL/I; in 1970–71 alone, it was sent to 100 different institutions, resulting in 60 of them purchasing it. By 1976, there were more than 200 sites around the world that had installed PL/C. Eventually, over 250 universities had used it. There was also some interest in PL/C from non-academic entities, thus resulting in PL/C adding support for some business-oriented features such as PICTURE variables. 

A survey conducted by New Mexico State University in 1972 looked at various possibilities for teaching languages and implementations and concluded regarding PL/C:
&quot;PL/C seems praiseworthy. Its purchase price ($1,800) is probably its biggest drawback. It has all of the built-in functions PL/I has, is much faster in both compilation and execution, and runs in 86K of a 100K partition leaving 14K for the student program. Its only real possible deficiency for student programs is its lack of record I/O capability. The PL/C compiler not only diagnoses errors, but often corrects them properly. It inserts missing parentheses and semicolons and shows both the invalid statement and the corrected statement. If PL/C finds a statement completely unrecognizable it deletes it and attempts execution anyway.&quot;

Some universities, including Washington State University, found success in teaching an introductory class that used PL/C first and then Fortran (using WATFIV) second, which was found to be a beneficial order in terms of student learning. Indeed, Cornell at one point restructured their introductory course offering to allow students the option to do that.

PL/C release numbers were to some extent synchronized to releases of the IBM PL/I F compiler, so that for instance Release 4 of PL/C was intended to match Version 4 of the IBM F compiler in terms of upward compatibility. In terms of some instances of PL/C distributions, Release 4 was available by January 1971; Release 6 by August 1971; Release 6.5 by November 1973; Release 7.1 in March 1975; and Release 7.5 in March 1976. The last version of PL/C appears to have been Release 7.6, put out in 1977.
== Variants ==
Within the computer science department at Cornell there was a sense of pride about PL/C being associated with the university, and there were several variants of PL/C worked on by Conway, other faculty members, and graduate students.

In 1974, the PL/CT variant of PL/C, for use on interactive terminals rather than in batch job submissions, was first made available at Cornell. A second release was made in 1975, and then it was made available to outside institutions in 1976. PL/CT primarily ran on an IBM System/370 under VM/CMS; it could also run in the IBM TSO environment. Somewhat unusually, PL/CT was not interpreted but rather was still implemented as a compiler. 

A variant under development by 1976 was PL/CS, which was a far more restricted subset of PL/I than regular PL/C and which provided direct language support for assertions. The subset was enough, however, that PL/CS would still be suitable for teaching introductory programming classes. It was implemented as an alternate lexical and syntactic analyzer that then plugged into the common PL/C code generator and runtime system. PL/CS was also used in research on the formal semantics of programming languages.

A different implementation of the PL/CS definition came with Professor Tim Teitelbaum and his pioneering Cornell Program Synthesizer work. This early instance of an integrated development environment was developed in 1978 for the PDP-11/60, and contained a structured editor for PL/CS along with an incremental compiler as well as an interpreter. The Cornell Program Synthesizer was soon adapted for the Terak desktop workstation, an early personal computer, which was based on the LSI-11 processor. The Terak computer found popularity for instructional use at Cornell and at other universities, as did the PL/CS available on it. In addition, Cornell built a link between the Terak and their IBM 370 mainframe, that would allow batch-mode execution of programs under PL/C and the obtaining of results on printers.

There was an even more experimental dialect being worked on, starting in 1975, that was known as PL/CV, which supplied some language support for formal proof of correctness and which ran as a separate verifier step. The PL/CV work was led by Professor Robert L. Constable. PL/CV used PL/CS as part of what it did, and indeed Constable had participated in the creation of PL/CS, especially working with Conway and David Gries on the adding of assertions. A second version, PL/CV2, was released in 1978 and was presented at the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages in 1979.

== Cross compilers ==
In the early 1970s, three cross compilers based on PL/C were created at the University of North Carolina; in these, the host platform was the IBM 360, and the target machine was one of several minicomputers in use at the time. The PL/C language subset was used in these cross compilers, as was the PL/C compiler&#x27;s first two passes for syntax and semantic analysis. However the IBM 360 code generation pass and storage allocation modules were replaced by ones specific to the target architecture.

The first of these cross compilers was PLCV (not to be confused with the PL/CV verifier), a cross compiler for Varian Data Machines minicomputers, specifically the 620/i and 620/f, and was created around 1971. An improved version of PLCV came out around 1973. The second, PLCI, was targeted at the Interdata Model 3; it also had a revised version around the same time. The third was PLCD, used to target the Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s PDP-11/45 minicomputer, which came out in 1973. Again, PLCD used PL/C but with the IBM 360 code generator replaced by one for PDP-11/45.

The University of North Carolina used these cross compilers for real projects, not just education; in particular, PLCD was used in support of a graphical programming environment that would use the same programming language for both a general purpose mainframe and a graphical support minicomputer, thereby allowing easier shifting of code from one to the other. The IBM PL/I F compiler was used on the mainframe, with programmers restricting themselves to the PL/C subset of the language, and PLCD was used to generate code for the PDP-11/45.

== Textbooks ==
The textbook &quot;An Introduction to Programming: A Structured Approach Using PL/I and PL/C&quot; was written by Conway and Gries using PL/C as the programming language and was published in 1973. It presented top-down design, and stressed the discipline of structured programming throughout, becoming one of the most prominent textbooks to do so. One section of the book was devoted to considerations of program correctness, such as the Invariant Relation Theorem; it is said to have been the first programming textbook to incorporate such material. The book had a potential market at any university using PL/C, and Conway later said that the book had sold very well. 

A second edition was published in 1975. Besides reorganizing some material on the development and testing of computer programs, it incorporated changes due to Release 7 of the PL/C compiler. A third edition was published in 1979 and, besides pitching the textbook material at a somewhat higher level to reflect that many college students had previous programming exposure in high school, incorporated additions to reflect the PL/CT and PL/CS variants of PL/C.

&quot;An Introduction to Programming: A Structured Approach&quot; was used as the basis for several offshoot textbooks, sometimes with additional co-authors, that were either aimed at a more beginning level or that covered other languages or dialects.

== Legacy ==
PL/C was still in use at the beginning of the 1980s. However, by then the Pascal programming language was beginning to come to the fore as a teaching language, and the move of student access towards smaller and more distributed computer systems than IBM mainframes also continued. And PL/I itself never gained the dominance its designers had hoped for in either the business or scientific programming fields. 

At Cornell itself, the switch to using Pascal in its introductory computer programming classes took place during 1984. Conway has said he does not know how long PL/C remained in use at the various sites where it was installed.

In 2012, an effort was ongoing to resurrect the popular Michigan Terminal System and the software that ran on it as part of an archival effort on IBM 360/370 simulators. Among the things they requested was permission to run the PL/C object code, which was informally granted by those staff associated with it who were still at Cornell.

, the source for PL/C appears to have been lost.

<doc id="309358" wikidata="Q1003048" url="?curid=309358" title="Buildering">
<text>Buildering (also known as edificeering, urban climbing, structuring, skywalking, boulding, or stegophily) describes the act of climbing on the outside of buildings and other artificial structures. If done without ropes or protection far off the ground, buildering is extremely dangerous. It is often practiced outside legal bounds, and is thus practiced mostly at night.

Night climbing is a particular branch of buildering which has been practiced for many years in a variety of locations, especially at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, England. Night climbing, as distinct from buildering, is performed mainly by undergraduates under cover of darkness. The term &quot;night climbing&quot; has replaced the older term &quot;roof climbing&quot;. The philosophy behind night climbing has undergone great change during the 21st century, with urban disciplines such as parkour having a heavy influence on the evolution of night climbing techniques and movements.

Adepts of buildering who are seen climbing on buildings without authorization are regularly met by police forces upon completing their exploit. Spectacular acts of buildering, such as free soloing skyscrapers, are usually accomplished by lone, experienced climbers, sometimes attracting large crowds of passers-by and media attention. These remain relatively rare.

Buildering can also take a form more akin to bouldering, which tends towards ascending or traversing shorter sections of buildings and structures. While still generally frowned upon by property owners, some, such as the University of Colorado at Boulder and Tufts University, turn a blind eye towards the practice in many locations.

Although often practised as a solo sport, buildering has also become a popular group activity. As in more traditional rock climbing, routes are established and graded for difficulty.

== Etymology ==

Buildering is a portmantau of the words &quot;building&quot; and &quot;bouldering&quot;.

==History==

In 1895, the great alpinist Geoffrey Winthrop Young started to climb the roofs of Cambridge University, England. Students had been scrambling up the university architecture for years, but Young was the first to document this activity. He wrote and published a buildering guide to Trinity College. Then in 1905, while a master at Eton College, Young produced another small volume on buildering, spoofing mountaineering.

In 1905, Harry H. Gardiner began buildering. He successfully climbed over 700 buildings in Europe and North America, usually wearing ordinary street clothes and using no special equipment.

In 1910, George Polley started his climbing career when the owner of a clothing store promised him a suit if he would climb to the roof of the building. He succeeded, and went on to climb over 2,000 buildings.

During the years from 1915 to 1920, buildering in New York City reached its peak. Before 1915, there were few skyscrapers in New York City, and after 1920, the city authorities had legislated to outlaw buildering. During this era, a number of daredevils climbed the tall buildings, but several of them fell to their deaths in the attempt.

In 1921, a group of undergraduates from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, published a buildering guide to that college.

In 1930, John Hurst wrote the second edition of Geoffrey Winthrop Young&#x27;s buildering guide to Trinity.

In 1937, a comprehensive and lighthearted account of Cambridge night climbing (undergraduate buildering) appeared in popular print, written by Noël Howard Symington, under the pseudonym &quot;Whipplesnaith&quot;.

In 1947, John Ciampa scaled the exterior of the Astor Hotel in New York City.

In 1960, Richard Williams wrote the third edition of the Trinity buildering guide. Night climbing remained popular in Cambridge during these post-war years. In 1970, a book entitled &quot;Night Climbing in Cambridge&quot; was published under the pseudonym &quot;Hederatus&quot;. Buildering also featured prominently in a book by F A Reeve, published in 1977.

In 1977, George Willig climbed the South Tower of the World Trade Center.

In the 1980s, Dan Goodwin scaled many of the world&#x27;s tallest buildings, including the World Trade Center, the Sears Tower, the John Hancock Center, the CN Tower, and most recently (1 March 2014) the Telephonica Building in Santiago, Chile for Stan Lee&#x27;s Superhumans

In the 1990s and the following decade, Alain Robert became the world&#x27;s most famous builderer by free soloing high buildings all over the globe.

In 2007, buildering in Cambridge was featured in a detective novel by Jill Paton Walsh.

Between 2007 and 2011, several books on night climbing were published by Oleander Press, of Cambridge. In 2007, they reprinted the Whipplesnaith book. In 2009, they reprinted Geoffrey Winthrop Young&#x27;s first edition of the Trinity Guide, and the St John&#x27;s Guide. In 2010, they reprinted John Hurst&#x27;s second edition of the Trinity Guide, as well as Young&#x27;s book &quot;Wall and Roof Climbing&quot;. In 2011, they published an omnibus edition of the three Trinity guides, including an introduction by Richard Williams which reviewed the history of night climbing in Cambridge from the 18th century to the present day. This introduction removed the cloak of anonymity that had previously protected the identities of the first nocturnal explorers.

From around 2008, buildering (also known as &quot;roofing&quot;) became popular amongst teenagers and young adults in eastern European countries including Russia and Ukraine. They (E.g., Mustang Wanted) shared footage of their achievements on video portals such as YouTube.

In 2013, the History Press published a book by John Engle on the history of student pranks at Trinity College Dublin, which featured a full chapter on the university&#x27;s long-standing night climbing tradition, including the buildering activities of the Dublin University Climbing Club.

In August 2016, a young man going by the name Stephen Rogata attempted to scale New York City&#x27;s 68-story Trump Tower using climbing gear and giant suction cups; NYPD officers apprehended him at the 21st floor.

==Notable builderers==
Alain Robert has achieved worldwide renown and is widely regarded as the greatest of all builderers. In 2011, he climbed the world&#x27;s tallest building, the 830-meter Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai. On that occasion, he used a harness in accordance with safety procedures, but most of his climbs have been free soloing. Other well-known structures that Robert has climbed include the Empire State Building in New York City, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, the Sears Tower in Chicago, the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai, The Doha Torch in Doha, Taipei 101 in Taiwan, and each of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He has also climbed a number of famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower and the Montparnasse Tower in France, and the Sydney Opera House in Australia. Robert has been arrested at the top of many of the major buildings he has climbed. He was born in France in 1962 as Robert Alain Phillipe, and is popularly known as &quot;the French Spider-Man&quot; and the &quot;Human Spider&quot;.

In the 1980s, Dan Goodwin, aka SpiderDan, aka Skyscraperman, in advocacy for high-rise firefighting and rescue, scaled many of the world&#x27;s tallest buildings and structures including the Sears Tower, the John Hancock Center, the North Tower of the World Trade Center, the Parque Central Complex in Caracas, Venezuela, and the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada. In 2010, Goodwin, now a stage four cancer survivor, scaled San Francisco, California&#x27;s sixty-story Millennium Tower to call attention to the fire department&#x27;s inability to conduct rescue operations in the upper floors of skyscrapers.

At least seven builderers became known as &quot;The Human Fly&quot;, all from the United States, as follows:

* George Willig, who climbed the South Tower of the World Trade Center in 1977. Like Alain Robert, he was also known as &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, after the comic hero who was first published by Marvel in 1962.
* John Ciampa, who climbed between 1942 and 1952. He was a stuntman and entertainer, and was also known as the &quot;Flying Phantom&quot; and the &quot;Brooklyn Tarzan&quot;.
* James A. Dearing, who scaled the Rutherford County Courthouse in 1923, but fell to his death after completing the climb. His stage name was Roy Royce.
* Harry F. Young, who was hired in 1923 to climb the Hotel Martinique in New York City, to promote the silent movie &quot;Safety Last!&quot; He lost his grip on the ascent, and fell nine stories to his death.
* George Polley, who climbed between 1910 and 1920. He died at the age of 29 from a brain tumor.
* Harry Gardiner, who climbed over 700 buildings in the United States and Europe between 1905 and 1918, usually wearing street clothes and tennis shoes, with no climbing equipment.
* James Lotito, in 2020 is the most recent builderer to be dubbed &quot;human fly&quot;. He has scaled many buildings and structures unaided, but is most known for an unsuccessful attempt in Manhattan.

In the 1930s, Whipplesnaith (Noël Symington) climbed many buildings in Cambridge, England.

==In media==
Notable examples of buildering have featured in several types of media, including:
* In film: &quot;Safety Last!&quot;, &quot;Doorways in the Sand&quot;
* In video games: &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot;, &quot;Uncharted&quot;

<doc id="309362" wikidata="Q222702" url="?curid=309362" title="Tarifa">
<text>Tarifa () is a Spanish municipality in the province of Cádiz, Andalusia. Located at the southernmost end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is primarily known as one of the world&#x27;s most popular destinations for windsports. Tarifa lies on the Costa de la Luz (&quot;coast of light&quot;) and across the Strait of Gibraltar facing Morocco.

Besides the city proper, the municipality also comprises several villages, including Tahivilla, Facinas, and Bolonia.

==History==
It was thought that Tarifa was once the site of the Roman settlement of Julia Transducta (also known as Julia Joza, or just Transducta). However, that settlement is now thought to have been where Algeciras now stands, while there is strong evidence that Casas de Porro, Valdevaqueros (Tarifa) was the site of the settlement of Mellaria. Tarifa was given its present name after the Islamic conquest of Tarif ibn Malik in 710, a military commander of Musa bin Nusayr. The village of Bolonia near Tarifa was also populated in Roman times (called Baelo Claudia). Roman ruins still exist near the village today.

After the Islamic conquest of southern Spain, the city was fortified starting from the 10th century. Later Tarifa was held by the taifa of Algeciras (1031) and by that of Seville (1057), and subsequently by the Almoravids. After the latter&#x27;s fall, it lived a short period under another taifa of Algeciras (1231), until becoming part of the Kingdom of Granada. In 1292 it was conquered by Sancho IV of Castile, and two years later it resisted a siege by North African Islamic troops. The town resisted another siege in 1340 from Marinid, eventually leading to the Battle of Río Salado.

Despite its formidable defenses, Tarifa remained sparsely populated for the rest of the middle ages. The destruction of Algeciras after the 1369 Nasrid conquest turned Tarifa into the sole power base for the Castilian navy in the Strait area, and the influence of the Admiralcy of Castile increased thereafter. Tarifa enjoyed a great deal of privileges confirmed by the Castilian monarchs, while being simultaneously threatened by Muslim raids that resulted into frequent killings and kidnappings. 

Owing to its largely military function after 1292, military activity weighted heavily in the place&#x27;s social structure in the early 15th century. The town was donated to Fadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile, in 1447. The seigneuralization was fiercely opposed by the inhabitants. Occupied by Gonzalo de Saavedra, Tarifa returned to the nominal status of &quot;&quot;, while largely controlled by the former. The mid-15th century saw the fostering of positive collaboration with the Portuguese across the strait.

After 1492, Tarifa lost part of its military value. Owing to its good pastures, husbandry played a notable role in the economy. It however lacked land dedicated to cereal crops. Already since the conquest and increasingly in the late middle ages, fishing activity provided riches to Tarifa, and an industry of the &quot;almadraba&quot; around tuna had developed in the early 16th century. In the early 16th century, the city became part of the seigneurial land of the Adelantado Mayor de Andalucía. Population increased in the 16th century, with around 3,500–4,000 inhabitants by 1587.

In 1514 it became the seat of a marquisate (Marquiss of Tarifa), including also Bornos, Espera and Alcalá de los Gazules.

In the course of the Peninsular War, Tarifa was besieged by French troops on 20 December 1810, and again on 18 December 1811. In both of these cases the town was defended by British troops from Gibraltar as the Spanish and British were allies against the French. During the 1811–12 Siege of Tarifa there were 3,000 defending troops with 1,200 of those British, including Colonel Charles Holloway who as commanding Royal Engineer made improvements to Tarifa&#x27;s defences.

On 19 December the town was attacked again by General Laval, who bombarded the town over Christmas to the point where surrender was demanded on 30 December. Both the British and Spanish commanders refused to comply and their defiance was rewarded by rain that started the next day. By 5 January the attacking force realised that their powder was wet and their guns were bogged down in mud, and retreated.

==Name==
The name &quot;Tarifa&quot; is derived from the name of the Umayyad Caliphate military commander, Tarif ibn Malik.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
At exactly 36 degrees latitude, the Punta de Tarifa is the southernmost point of continental Europe. (The only parts of Europe farther south are islands - including the Greek island of Gavdos, which is the southernmost point of Europe.) The North African capitals of Algiers and Tunis actually lie farther north than Tarifa.

===Climate===
Tarifa features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), bordering a warm-summer (Csb) Mediterranean climate according to the Köppen climate classification. The influence of the ocean creates a very small annual variation in temperatures. The average daily high in the hottest month, August, is only 9.3°C above the average lowest temperature during the month of January, and more than 10°C cooler than temperatures experienced further inland in the Guadalquivir valley. Thus Tarifa features a unique microclimate. Summers are strongly moderated by the cool waters of the Atlantic Ocean much more so than neighbouring cities along Spain&#x27;s Mediterranean and Atlantic coast. Likewise, winters are some of the mildest in continental Europe. Rain falls primarily during the winter, with summer being largely dry as is the norm in this type of climate.

==Main sights==


Historical landmarks of the city include:
*the well-preserved Guzmán castle, near the port, built by order of caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III (960). Annexed are the Guzmán el Bueno Tower (13th century) and the church of St. Mary, on the site of a former mosque.
*remains of the medieval walls. Of three gates once existing, today only the &quot;Puerta de Jerez&quot; (13th century) has survived.
*Church of St. Matthew, built in the early 16th century in Gothic style, also over a former mosque. The façade was redesigned by Torcuato Cayón de la Vega in 1774.
*The ruins of the Roman city of Baelo Claudia, located nearby.
*Tarifa has become a popular spot for northern Europeans to spend their summers.
*Tarifa&#x27;s unique wind conditions have made the beaches at Playa de Los Lances, Valdevaqueros and Punta Paloma the most popular in Europe with windsurfers and kitesurfers. The funnel created by the Strait of Gibraltar creates a Venturi effect when either the Levante (Easterly wind from Africa) or Poniente (Westerly wind from the Atlantic) is blowing. These two winds prevail in Tarifa for over 300 days most years, meaning Tarifa experiences exceptionally strong and consistent winds throughout the year. In addition, localised thermal winds at locations such as Valdevaqueros mean that even when the prevailing wind is not strong it is often possible to windsurf and kite surf in Tarifa. These unique wind conditions are also the reason Tarifa is dotted with countless wind turbines.
*&quot;La Isla&quot;, a small island that is connected to the mainland by a 30m long bridge. This island and its connecting bridge are considered the official divide between the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Andalusia.

Tarifa is located within the , a renowned place to watch migrating birds, in particular the storks which cross the Straits of Gibraltar in spring and autumn. Also whale and dolphin watching can be done as there are several species living on the 14 kilometre-wide Straits, for instance the common dolphin, Pilot whale, sperm whale and orca.

==Cinema==
Tarifa is renowned for its African Film Festival, whose first edition took place in 2004.
==Books==
Tarifa is popular for its placement in &quot;The Alchemist&quot;.

Tarifa is a location for a visit in Laurie Lee&#x27;s A Rose for Winter.

==Transportation==

There are regular ferry services connecting Tarifa with Tangier (40 minutes) and Ceuta (1 hour) from the ferry port.

Bus services run from the bus station on Calle Batalla de Salado. There are regular services between Tarifa and Algeciras, about 20 km to the northeast, and Seville about 200 km to the north. Direct buses also run to Málaga and Cádiz. In high summer a special kitesurfing bus runs along the A7 between Tarifa bus station and Camping Jardin de las Dunas, stopping at popular hotels and campsites along the route.

There is a taxi rank on the Avenida Andalucía. It is about 5 minutes walk from the bus station and is located just outside the Puerto de Jerez (the main entrance to the old town) at the junction of Avenida Andalucía and Calle Batalla de Salado.

==Surroundings==
The intentional community &quot;Molino de Guadalmesi&quot;, which is part of the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN), is located about 13 km north-east from Tarifa.

==In literature==
*The city of Tarifa is depicted in the 1986 worldwide bestseller fiction novel, &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, by Paulo Coelho. The lead protagonist, a shepherd boy, visits the city to meet an interpreter of dreams and ask her to interpret a recurrent dream he has had twice. His life takes a dramatic turn when he meets an old king of Salem named &quot;Melchizedek&quot; at a city marketplace.

* The city of Tarifa is depicted in the first chapter of Laurie Lee&#x27;s 1955 novel, &quot;A Rose For Winter&quot;.

<text>Magnum Photos is an international photographic cooperative owned by its photographer-members, with offices in Paris, New York City, London and Tokyo. It was founded in 1947 in Paris by photographers Robert Capa, David &quot;Chim&quot; Seymour, Maria Eisner, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger, William Vandivert, and Rita Vandivert. Its photographers retain all copyrights to their own work.

In 2010, MSD Capital acquired a collection of nearly 200,000 original press prints of images taken by Magnum photographers, which in 2013 it donated to the Harry Ransom Center.

==Founding of agency==
Magnum was founded in Paris in 1947 by Robert Capa, David &quot;Chim&quot; Seymour, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger and William Vandivert (all photographers), Rita Vandivert and Maria Eisner, based on an idea of Capa&#x27;s. (Seymour, Cartier-Bresson and Rodger were all absent from the meeting at which it was founded. In response to a letter telling him that he was a member, Rodger wrote that Magnum seemed a good idea but, &quot;It all sounded too halcyon to be true,&quot; when Capa had told him of it and, &quot;I rather dismissed the whole thing from my mind&quot;.)

Rita Vandivert was the first President, and head of the New York office; Maria Eisner the head of the Paris office. The plan was for Rodger to cover Africa and the Middle East; Cartier-Bresson to cover south and east Asia; Seymour and William Vandivert to cover Europe and the United States, respectively; and Capa to be free to follow his curiosity and events.

Magnum is one of the first photographic cooperatives, owned and administered entirely by members. The staff serve a support role for the photographers, who retain all copyrights to the photographs they take.

The Magnum cooperative has included photojournalists from across the world, who have covered many historical events of the 20th century. The cooperative&#x27;s archive includes photographs depicting family life, drugs, religion, war, poverty, famine, crime, government and celebrities.

Although it has been asserted that the name &quot;Magnum&quot; was chosen because the founding members always drank a bottle of champagne during the first meetings, Russell Miller writes:
It was . . . presumably agreed by those present [at the first meeting] that Magnum was a fine new name for such a bold new venture, indicative as it was of greatness in its literal Latin translation, toughness in its gun connotation and celebration in its champagne mode.
== Governance ==
Magnum is owned by its photographers, who act as shareholders. Each full member of Magnum has a vote in proposals made at a meeting held once a year, called the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Photographers with the status of contributor or correspondent are represented by Magnum but have no voting rights. Full members can choose to become contributors after 23 years of membership; this status gives them increased liberty to work outside Magnum, at the cost of their voting rights.

==Elections of new members==

In the early years of Magnum, membership had generally come about by the personal invitation of Robert Capa. However, in 1955 a three-stage membership system was set up that continues to this day and is described below. Until 1953 there were also a large number of stringers who used Magnum but were not members.

Magnum&#x27;s photographers meet once a year, during the last weekend in June, in New York City, Paris or London, to discuss the cooperative&#x27;s business. One day of the meeting is reserved to review potential new members&#x27; portfolios and vote on admitting individuals. An approved applicant is invited to become a &#x27;Nominee Member&#x27; of Magnum, a category of membership that provides a chance for members and the individual to get to know each other, but that includes no binding commitments on either side.

After two years of Nominee membership, a photographer may present another portfolio if wanting to apply for &#x27;Associate Membership&#x27;. If successful, the photographer is bound by the rules of the agency, and enjoys its facilities and worldwide representation. The difference between an Associate Member and a full Member is that an Associate is not a Director of the Company and does not have voting rights in the corporate decision-making. After two more years, an Associate wanting to be considered for full membership presents another portfolio of work for consideration by the members. Once elected as a full member, the individual is a member of Magnum for life or for as long as the photographer chooses.

==Accusations of child abuse ==
Magnum Photos&#x27; digital archive constitutes more than 1 million images, that Magnum licenses through its website. In August 2020, the Magnum website was taken offline after issues were raised by the &quot;Fstoppers&quot; photography website and amplified on social media by others including Jörg Colberg. Given the tags on the photos, there was concern that Magnum was making available photographs of children featuring nudity; that documented encounters that constituted a record of acts of child sexual abuse; and that were problematic in terms of the way they had been labelled for searching. &quot;Much of the criticism [. . .] has focused on a series of photographs by the US photographer David Alan Harvey from his time documenting sex workers in Bangkok in 1989.&quot; In a statement Magnum said it will re-examine the content of its archive, and has since made its website available again but without Harvey&#x27;s Bangkok series. Harvey was later suspended for a year following a formal investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him.

==Photographic collection==
In February 2010, Magnum announced that Michael Dell&#x27;s venture capital firm MSD Capital had acquired a collection of nearly 200,000 original press prints of images taken by Magnum photographers. It had formed a partnership with the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin to preserve, catalog, and make photographs available to the general public. In September 2013 it was announced MSD Capital donated the collection to the Ransom Center. A preliminary inventory is available for researchers who wish to use the collection.

==Graduate Photographers Award==
The Graduate Photographers Award was established in 2015.

<doc id="309379" wikidata="Q1163216" url="?curid=309379" title="Symbolic interactionism">
<text>Symbolic interactionism is a sociological theory that develops from practical considerations and alludes to humans&#x27; particular use of shared language to create common symbols and meanings, for use in both intra- and interpersonal communication.

It is particularly important in microsociology and social psychology. It is derived from the American philosophy of pragmatism and particularly from the work of George Herbert Mead, as a pragmatic method to interpret social interactions.

According to Mead, symbolic interactionism is &quot;The ongoing use of language and gestures in anticipation of how the other will react; a conversation&quot;. Symbolic interactionism is &quot;a framework for building theory that sees society as the product of everyday interactions of individuals&quot;. In other words, it is a frame of reference to better understand how individuals interact with one another to create symbolic worlds, and in return, how these worlds shape individual behaviors. It is a framework that helps understand how society is preserved and created through repeated interactions between individuals. The interpretation process that occurs between interactions helps create and recreate meaning. It is the shared understanding and interpretations of meaning that affect the interaction between individuals. Individuals act on the premise of a shared understanding of meaning within their social context. Thus, interaction and behavior are framed through the shared meaning that objects and concepts have attached to them. Symbolic Interactionism refers to both verbal and nonverbal communication. From this view, people live in both natural and symbolic environments.

==History==

=== George Herbert Mead ===

Symbolic interaction was conceived by George Herbert Mead and Charles Horton Cooley. Mead was born in South Hadley, Massachusetts in the year 1863. Mead was influenced by many theoretical and philisocial traditions, such as, utilitarianism, evolutionism, pragmatism, behaviorism, and the looking-glass-self. Mead was a social constructionist. Mead argued that people&#x27;s selves are social products, but that these selves are also purposive and creative, and believed that the true test of any theory was that it was &quot;useful in solving complex social problems&quot;. Mead&#x27;s influence was said to be so powerful that sociologists regard him as the one &quot;true founder&quot; of the symbolic interactionism tradition.
Although Mead taught in a philosophy department, he is best known by sociologists as the teacher who trained a generation of the best minds in their field. Strangely, he never set forth his wide-ranging ideas in a book or systematic treatise. Mead began his teachings at the University of Michigan then moved to the University of Chicago. After his death in 1931, his students pulled together class notes and conversations with their mentor and published &quot;Mind, Self and Society&quot; in his name. It is a common misconception that John Dewey was the leader of this sociological theory; according to &quot;The Handbook of Symbolic Interactionism,&quot; Mead was undoubtedly the individual who &quot;transformed the inner structure of the theory, moving it to a higher level of theoretical complexity.&quot;
&quot;Mind, Self and Society&quot; is the book published by Mead&#x27;s students based on his lectures and teaching, and the title of the book highlights the core concept of social interactionism. &quot;Mind&quot; refers to an individual&#x27;s ability to use symbols to create meanings for the world around the individual – individuals use language and thought to accomplish this goal. &quot;Self&quot; refers to an individual&#x27;s ability to reflect on the way that the individual is perceived by others. Finally, &quot;society&quot;, according to Mead, is where all of these interactions are taking place. A general description of Mead&#x27;s compositions portray how outside social structures, classes, and power and abuse affect the advancement of self, personality for gatherings verifiably denied of the ability to characterize themselves.

=== Herbert Blumer ===
Herbert Blumer, a student and interpreter of Mead, coined the term and put forward an influential summary: people act a certain way towards things based on the meaning those things already have, and these meanings are derived from social interaction and modified through interpretation. Blumer was a social constructionist, and was influenced by John Dewey; as such, this theory is very phenomenologically-based. Given that Blumer was the first to use symbolic interaction as a term, he is known as the founder of symbolic interaction. He believed that the &quot;Most human and humanizing activity that people engage in is talking to each other.&quot; According to Blumer, human groups are created by people and it is only actions between them that define a society. He argued that with interaction and through interaction individuals are able to &quot;produce common symbols by approving, arranging, and redefining them.&quot; Having said that, interaction is shaped by a mutual exchange of interpretation, the ground of socialization.

===Other theorists===

While having less influential work in the discipline, Charles Horton Cooley and William Isaac Thomas are considered to be influential representatives of the theory. Cooley&#x27;s work on connecting society and the individuals influenced Mead&#x27;s further workings. Cooley felt society and the individuals could only be understood in relationship to each other. Cooley&#x27;s concept of the &quot;looking-glass self,&quot; influenced Mead&#x27;s theory of self and symbolic interactionism. W. I. Thomas is also known as a representative of symbolic interactionism. His main work was a theory of human motivation addressing interactions between individuals and the &quot;social sources of behaviors.&quot; He attempted to &quot;explain the proper methodological approach to social life; develop a theory of human motivation; spell out a working conception of adult socialization; and provide the correct perspective on deviance and disorganization.&quot; A majority of scholars agree with Thomas.

Two other theorists who have influenced symbolic interaction theory are Yrjö Engeström and David Middleton. Engeström and Middleton explained the usefulness of symbolic interactionism in the communication field in a variety of work settings, including &quot;courts of law, health care, computer software design, scientific laboratory, telephone sales, control, repair, and maintenance of advanced manufacturing systems&quot;. Other scholars credited for their contribution to the theory are Thomas, Park, James, Horton Cooley, Znaniecki, Baldwin, Redfield, and Wirth. Unlike other social sciences, symbolic interactionism emphasizes greatly on the ideas of action instead of culture, class and power. According to behaviorism, Darwinism, pragmatism, as well as Max Weber, action theory contributed significantly to the formation of social interactionism as a theoretical perspective in communication studies.

==Assumptions, premises, and research methodology==
=== Assumptions ===
Most symbolic interactionists believe a physical reality does indeed exist by an individual&#x27;s social definitions, and that social definitions do develop in part or in relation to something &quot;real&quot;. People thus do not respond to this reality directly, but rather to the social understanding of reality; i.e., they respond to this reality indirectly through a kind of filter which consists of individuals&#x27; different perspectives. This means that humans exist not in the physical space composed of realities, but in the &quot;world&quot; composed only of &quot;objects&quot;. According to Erving Goffman, what motivates humans to position their body parts in certain manners and the desires to capture and examine those moments are two of the elements that constitute the composition of the social reality which is made of various individuals&#x27; perceptions, it&#x27;s crucial to examine how these two elements occur. It appeals to symbolic interactionists to shift more emphases on the realistic aspect of their empirical observation and theorizing.

Three assumptions frame symbolic interactionism:
# &quot;Individuals construct meaning via the communication process.&quot;
# &quot;Self-concept is a motivation for behavior.&quot;
# &quot;A unique relationship exists between the individual and society.&quot;

=== Premises ===
Having defined some of the underlying assumptions of symbolic interactionism, it is necessary to address the premises that each assumption supports. According to Blumer (19f.69), there are three premises that can be derived from the assumptions above.

1) &quot;Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things.&quot;

The first premise includes everything that a human being may note in their world, including physical objects, actions and concepts. Essentially, individuals behave towards objects and others based on the personal meanings that the individual has already given these items. Meaning is not automatically associated, it is ascribed through interactions. Blumer was trying to put emphasis on the meaning behind individual behaviors, specifically speaking, psychological and sociological explanations for those actions and behaviors.

2) &quot;The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and the society.&quot;

The second premise explains the meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with other humans. Blumer, following Mead, claimed people interact with each other by interpreting or defining each other&#x27;s actions instead of merely reacting to each other&#x27;s actions Their &quot;response&quot; is not made directly to the actions of one another but instead is based on the meaning which they attach to such actions. Thus, human interaction is mediated by the use of symbols and signification, by interpretation, or by ascertaining the meaning of one another&#x27;s actions. Mead believed not in stimulus-response, but in stimulus-interpretation-response. The meaning we assign to our communication is what is important. Meaning is either taken for granted and pushed aside as an unimportant element which need not to be investigated, or it is regarded as a mere neutral link or one of the causal chains between the causes or factors responsible for human behavior and this behavior as the product of such factors.

3) &quot;The Meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person in dealing with the things he/she [sic] encounters.&quot;

Symbolic interactionists describe thinking as an inner conversation. Mead called this inner dialogue &quot;minding&quot;, which is the delay in one&#x27;s thought process that happens when one thinks about what they will do next. These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive process used by the person in dealing with the things that they encounter. We naturally talk to ourselves in order to sort out the meaning of a difficult situation. But first, we need language. Before we can think, we must be able to interact symbolically. The emphasis on symbols, negotiated meaning, and social construction of society brought attention to the roles people play. Role-taking is a key mechanism that permits people to see another person&#x27;s perspective to understand what an action might mean to another person. Role-taking is a part of our lives at an early age, for instance, playing house and pretending to be someone else. There is an improvisational quality to roles; however, actors often take on a script that they follow. Because of the uncertainty of roles in social contexts, the burden of role-making is on the person in the situation. In this sense, we are proactive participants in our environment.

Some theorists have proposed an additional fourth premise:

4) &quot;It&#x27;s the inherent human desire to acquire potential psychological rewards from interacting with others that motivates us to establish realities filtered through social interactions&quot;

Some symbolic interactionists point out the ineradicable nexus of the desire for potential psychological reward between individuals and their respective socially constructed realities that is commonly known as the &quot;society&quot;, these experts have confirmed that one crucial premise for analyzing and dissecting symbolic interactionism is the psychological reward that drives individuals to connect with others and create meanings via social interactions. We as humans instinctively discern individuals whom we want to be associated with, before we initiate an interaction with them, we would experience an internal emotional rush biologically that encourages us to initiate the interaction, thus beginning to form various socially constructed realities that enables symbolic interactionism to examine, namely it&#x27;s our desires for emotional rewards that makes the theory of symbolic interactionism possible and viable.

=== Research methodology ===
The majority of interactionist research uses qualitative research methods, like participant observation, to study aspects of social interaction, and/or individuals&#x27; selves. Participant observation allows researchers to access symbols and meanings, as in Howard Becker&#x27;s &quot;Art Worlds&quot; and Arlie Hochschild&#x27;s &quot;The Managed Heart&quot;. They argue that close contact and immersion in the everyday activities of the participants is necessary for understanding the meaning of actions, defining situations and the process that actors construct the situation through their interaction. Because of this close contact, interactions cannot remain completely liberated of value commitments. In most cases, they make use of their values in choosing what to study; however, they seek to be objective in how they conduct the research. Therefore, the symbolic-interaction approach is a micro-level orientation focusing on human interaction in specific situations.

==Five central ideas==

There are five central ideas to symbolic interactionism according to Joel M. Charon (2004):

# &quot;The human being must be understood as a social person. It is the constant search for social interaction that leads us to do what we do. Instead of focusing on the individual and his or her personality, or on how the society or social situation causes human behavior, symbolic interactionism focuses on the activities that take place between actors. Interaction is the basic unit of study. Individuals are created through interaction; society too is created through social interaction. What we do depends on interaction with others earlier in our lifetimes, and it depends on our interaction right now. Social interaction is central to what we do. If we want to understand cause, focus on social interaction.
# The human being must be understood as a thinking being. Human action is not only interaction among individuals but also interaction within the individual. It is not our ideas or attitudes or values that are as important as the constant active ongoing process of thinking. We are not simply conditioned, we are not simply beings who are influenced by those around us, we are not simply products of society. We are, to our very core, thinking animals, always conversing with ourselves as we interact with others. If we want to understand cause, focus on human thinking.
# Humans do not sense their environment directly; instead, humans define the situation they are in. An environment may actually exist, but it is our definition of it that is important. Definition does not simply randomly happen; instead, it results from ongoing social interaction and thinking.
# The cause of human action is the result of what is occurring in our present situation. Cause unfolds in the present social interaction, present thinking, and present definition. It is not society&#x27;s encounters with us in our past that causes action, nor is it our own past experience that does. It is, instead, social interaction, thinking, definition of the situation that takes place in the present. Our past enters into our actions primarily because we think about it and apply it to the definition of the present situation.
# Human beings are described as active beings in relation to their environment. Words such as conditioning, responding, controlled, imprisoned, and formed are not used to describe the human being in symbolic interaction. In contrast to other social-scientific perspectives humans are not thought of as being passive in relation to their surroundings, but actively involved in what they do.&quot;

==Central interactionist themes==
To Blumer&#x27;s conceptual perspective, he put them in three core propositions: that people act toward things, including each other, on the basis of the meanings they have for them; that these meanings are derived through social interaction with others; and that these meanings are managed and transformed through an interpretive process that people use to make sense of and handle the objects that constitute their social worlds. This perspective can also be described as three core principles- Meaning, Language and Thinking- in which social constructs are formed. The principle of meaning is the center of human behavior. Language provides meaning by providing means to symbols. These symbols differentiate social relations of humans from that of animals. By humans giving meaning to symbols, they can express these things with language. In turn, symbols form the basis of communication. Symbols become imperative components for the formation of any kind of communicative act. Thinking then changes the interpretation of individuals as it pertains to symbols.

Some symbolic interactionists like Goffman had pointed out the obvious defects of the pioneering Mead concept upon which the contemporary symbolic interactionism is built, it has influenced the modern symbolic interactionism to be more conducive to conceiving &quot;social-psychological concerns rather than sociological concerns&quot;. For instance, during analyzing symbolic interactionism, the participants&#x27; emotional fluctuations that are inexorably entailed are often ignored because they are too sophisticated and volatile to measure. When the participants are being selected to participate in certain activities that are not part of their normal daily routine, it will inevitably disrupt the participants psychologically, causing spontaneous thoughts to flow that are very likely to make the participants veer away from their normal behaviors. These psychological changes could result in the participants&#x27; emotional fluctuations that manifest themselves in the participants&#x27; reactions; therefore, manufacturing biases that will the previously mentioned biases. This critique unveiled the lack of scrutiny on participants&#x27; internal subjective processing of their environment which initiates the reasoning and negotiating faculties, which the contemporary symbolic interactionism also reflects. Henceforth, prejudice is not a purely psychological phenomenon, instead it can be interpreted from a symbolic interactionism standpoint, taking individuals&#x27; construction of the social reality into account.

=== Principles ===
Keeping Blumer&#x27;s earlier work in mind David A. Snow, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, suggests four broader and even more basic orienting principles: human agency, interactive determination, symbolization, and emergence. Snow uses these four principles as the thematic bases for identifying and discussing contributions to the study of social movements.

# Human agency: emphasizes the active, willful, goal-seeking character of human actors. The emphasis on agency focuses attention on those actions, events, and moments in social life in which agentic action is especially palpable.
# Interactive determination: specifies that understanding of focal objects of analysis, whether they are self-concepts, identities, roles, practices, or even social movements. Basically this means, neither individual, society, self, or others exist only in relation to each other and therefore can be fully understood only in terms of their interaction.
# Symbolization&quot;:&quot; highlights the processes through which events and conditions, artifacts, people, and other environmental features that take on particular meanings, becoming nearly only objects of orientation. Human behavior is partly contingent on what the object of orientation symbolizes or means.
# Emergence: focuses on attention on the processual and non-habituated side of social life, focusing not only on organization and texture of social life, but also associated meaning and feelings. The principle of emergence points us not only to the possibility of new forms of social life and system meaning but also to transformations in existing forms of social organization.

== Applications ==
Symbolic interaction can be used to explain one&#x27;s identity in terms of roles being &quot;ideas and principles on &#x27;what to do&#x27; in a given situation,&quot; as noted by Hewitt. Symbolic Interactionist identity presents in 3 categories- situated, personal and social. Situated identity refers to the ability to view themselves as others do. This is often a snapshot view in that it is short, but can be very impactful. From this experience, one wishes to differentiate themselves from others and the personal identity comes to exist. This view is when one wishes to make themselves known for who they truly are, not the view of others. From the personal identity taking place, comes the social identity where connections and likeness are made with individuals sharing similar identities or identity traits.

This viewpoint of symbolic interactionism can be applied to the use of social networking sites and how one&#x27;s identity is presented on those sites. With social networking sites, one can boast (or post) their identity through their newsfeed. The personal identity presents itself in the need for individuals to post milestones that one has achieved, in efforts to differentiate themselves. The social identity presents itself when individuals &quot;tag&quot; others in their posts, pictures, etc. Situated identities may be present in the need to defend something on social media or arguments that occur in comments, where one feels it necessary to &quot;prove&quot; themselves.

Coming from the viewpoint that we learn, or at least desire, how to expect other people&#x27;s reactions/responses to things, Bruce Link and his colleagues studied how expectations of the reactions of others can affect the mental illness stigma. The participants of the study were individuals with psychosis who answered questions relating to discrimination, stigma, and rejection. The goal of the study was to determine whether others&#x27; expectations affect the participants&#x27; internalized stigmas, anticipated rejection, concerns with staying in, and other. Results found that high levels of internalized stigma were only present in the minority, however, anticipation of rejection, stigma consciousness, perceived devaluation discrimination and concerns with staying in were found to be more prevalent in participants. These perceptions were correlated with the outcomes of withdrawal, self-esteem and isolation from relatives. The study found that anticipation of rejection played the largest role in internalized stigmas.

Applications on social roles

Symbolic interactionism can be used to dissect the concept of social role and further study relations between friends. A social role begins to exist when an individual initiates interaction with other people who would comprise a social circle in which the initiator is the central terminal, the accumulated proceedings of duties and rights performed by the central person and all the other participants in this social circle reinforces this dynamic circle. Apart from the central role, such social groups are constituted of participants who benefit from the central figure and those who are eligible and capable of helping the central role to achieve its envisioned objectives. The roles in the social role dynamic aren&#x27;t preordained although the prevalent culture of a specific society usually possesses a default structure to most social roles. Despite the fact that the predominant culture of a certain society typically exerts large amount of influence on the instinctive formation of the structures in social groups, the roles in social groups are eventually formed based on the interactions occurred between the central figure and other potential participants in this role. For illustration, if a central person of the social role is a police officer, then this social role can contain victims, teammates, operators, the dispatch, potential suspects, lieutenant. Social roles could be formulated by happenstances, but it can&#x27;t escape the inexorable reconfiguration of multilateral exchanges of each role&#x27;s obligations in a social role. (Lopata 1964). Through this lens, the examination of various social roles becomes more receptive and accessible, which also possesses the same effects on examining friendship and other vocations.

==Criticisms==
Symbolic interactionists are often criticized for being overly impressionistic in their research methods and somewhat unsystematic in their theories. It is argued that the theory is not one theory, but rather, the &quot;framework&quot; for many different theories. Additionally, some theorists have a problem with symbolic interaction theory due to its lack of testability. These objections, combined with the fairly narrow focus of interactionist research on small-group interactions and other social psychological issues, have relegated the interactionist camp to a minority position among sociologists (albeit a fairly substantial minority). Much of this criticism arose during the 1970s in the U.S. when quantitative approaches to sociology were dominant, and perhaps the best known of these is by Alvin Gouldner.

===Framework and theories===
Some critiques of symbolic interactionism are based on the assumption that it is a theory, and the critiques apply the criteria for a &quot;good&quot; theory to something that does not claim to be a theory. Some critics find the symbolic interactionist framework too broad and general when they are seeking specific theories. Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical &quot;framework&quot; rather than a theory and can be assessed on the basis of effective conceptualizations. The theoretical framework, as with any theoretical framework, is vague when it comes to analyzing empirical data or predicting outcomes in social life. As a framework rather than a theory, many scholars find it difficult to use. Interactionism being a framework rather than a theory makes it impossible to test interactionism in the manner that a specific theoretical claim about the relationship between specific variables in a given context allows. Unlike the symbolic interactionist framework, the many theories derived from symbolic interactionism, such as role theory and the versions of identity theory developed by Sheldon Stryker, as well as Peter Burke and colleagues, clearly define concepts and the relationships between them in a given context, thus allowing for the opportunity to develop and test hypotheses. Further, especially among Blumerian processual interactionists, a great number of very useful conceptualizations have been developed and applied in a very wide range of social contexts, types of populations, types of behaviors, and cultures and subcultures.

===Social structure===
Symbolic interactionism is often related and connected with social structure. This concept suggests that symbolic interactionism is a construction of people&#x27;s social reality. It also implies that from a realistic point of view, the interpretations that are being made will not make much difference. When the reality of a situation is defined, the situation becomes a meaningful reality. This includes methodological criticisms, and critical sociological issues. A number of symbolic interactionists have addressed these topics, the best known being Stryker&#x27;s structural symbolic interactionism and the formulations of interactionism heavily influenced by this approach (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Indiana School&quot; of symbolic interactionism), including the works of key scholars in sociology and psychology using different methods and theories applying a structural version of interactionism that are represented in a 2003 collection edited by Burke &quot;et al&quot;. Another well-known structural variation of symbolic interactionism that applies quantitative methods is Manford H. Kuhn&#x27;s formulation which is often referred to in sociological literature as the &quot;Iowa School.&quot; Negotiated order theory also applies a structural approach.

==== Language ====
Language is viewed as the source of all meaning. Blumer illuminates several key features about social interactionism. Most people interpret things based on assignment and purpose. The interaction occurs once the meaning of something has become identified. This concept of meaning is what starts to construct the framework of social reality. By aligning social reality, Blumer suggests that language is the meaning of interaction. Communication, especially in the form of symbolic interactionism is connected with language. Language initiates all forms of communication, verbal and non-verbal. Blumer defines this source of meaning as a connection that arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.

==== Critical perspective ====
According to social theorist Patricia Burbank, the concepts of synergistic and diverging properties are what shape the viewpoints of humans as social beings. These two concepts are different in a sense because of their views of human freedom and their level of focus. According to Burbank, actions are based on the effects of situations that occur during the process of social interaction. Another important factor in meaningful situations is the environment in which the social interaction occurs. The environment influences interaction, which leads to a reference group and connects with perspective, and then concludes to a definition of the situation. This illustrates the proper steps to define a situation. An approval of the action occurs once the situation is defined. An interpretation is then made upon that action, which may ultimately influence the perspective, action, and definition.

Stryker emphasizes that the sociology world at large is the most viable and vibrant intellectual framework. By being made up of our thoughts and self-belief, the social interactionism theory is the purpose of all human interaction, and is what causes society to exist. This fuels criticisms of the symbolic interactionist framework for failing to account for social structure, as well as criticisms that interactionist theories cannot be assessed via quantitative methods, and cannot be falsifiable or tested empirically. Framework is important for the symbolic interaction theory because in order for the social structure to form, there are certain bonds of communication that need to be established to create the interaction. Much of the symbolic interactionist framework&#x27;s basic tenets can be found in a very wide range of sociological and psychological work, without being explicitly cited as interactionist, making the influence of symbolic interactionism difficult to recognize given this general acceptance of its assumptions as &quot;common knowledge.&quot;

Another problem with this model is two-fold, in that it 1) does not take into account human emotions very much, implying that symbolic interaction is not completely psychological; and 2) is interested in social structure to a limited extent, implying that symbolic interaction is not completely sociological. These incompetencies frame meaning as something that occurs naturally within an interaction under a certain condition, rather than taking into account the basic social context in which interaction is positioned. From this view, meaning has no source and does not perceive a social reality beyond what humans create with their own interpretations.

Another criticism of symbolic interactionism is more so on the scholars themselves. They are noted to not take interest in the history of this sociological approach. This has the ability to produce shallow understanding and can make the subject &quot;hard to teach&quot; based on the lack of organization in its teachings to relate with other theories or studies.

=== Limitations ===
Some symbolic interactionists like Goffman had pointed out the obvious defects of the pioneering Mead concept upon which the contemporary symbolic interactionism is built, it has influenced the modern symbolic interactionism to be more conducive to conceiving &quot;social-psychological concerns rather than sociological concerns&quot;. For instance, during analyzing symbolic interactionism, the participants&#x27; emotional fluctuations that are inexorably entailed are often ignored because they are too sophisticated and volatile to measure.

Henceforth, prejudice is not a purely psychological phenomenon, instead it can be interpreted from a symbolic interactionism standpoint, taking individuals&#x27; construction of the social reality into account.

==Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction==
The Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction (SSSI) is an international professional organization for scholars, who are interested in the study of symbolic interaction. SSSI holds a conference in conjunction with the meeting of the American Sociological Association (ASA) and the Society for the Study of Social Problems. This conference typically occurs in August and sponsors the SSSI holds the Couch-Stone Symposium each spring. The Society provides travel scholarships for student members interested in attending the annual conference. At the annual conference, the SSSI sponsors yearly awards in different categories of symbolic interaction. Additionally, some of the awards are open to student members of the society. The Ellis-Bochner Autoethnography and Personal Narrative Research Award is given annually by the SSSI affiliate of the National Communication Association for the best article, essay, or book chapter in autoethnography and personal narrative research. The award is named after renowned autoethnographers Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner. The society also sponsors a quarterly journal, &quot;Symbolic Interaction,&quot; and releases a newsletter, &quot;SSSI Notes&quot;.

SSSI also has a European branch, which organizes an annual conference that integrates European symbolic interactionists.

<doc id="309380" wikidata="Q2666510" url="?curid=309380" title="Hörgr">
<text>A &#x27; (Old Norse, ) or &#x27; (Old English, ) is a type of altar or cult site, possibly consisting of a heap of stones, used in Norse religion, as opposed to a roofed hall used as a &quot;hof&quot; (temple).

The Old Norse term is attested in both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, in the sagas of Icelanders, skaldic poetry, and with its Old English cognate in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The word is also reflected in various place names (in English placenames as &quot;harrow&quot;), often in connection with Germanic deities.

==Etymology==
Old Norse &quot;hǫrgr&quot; means &quot;altar, sanctuary&quot;, while Old English &quot;hearg&quot; refers to a &quot;holy grove; temple, idol&quot;. From these, and the Old High German cognate &quot;harug&quot;, Proto-Germanic &quot;*harugaz&quot; has been reconstructed, possibly cognate with Insular Celtic &quot;carrac&quot; &quot;cliff&quot;.

==Old Norse tradition==

===Literary===
The term &quot;hörgr&quot; is used three times in poems collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. In a stanza early in the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, the völva says that early in the mythological timeline, the gods met together at the location of Iðavöllr and constructed a hörgr and a hof (Henry Adams Bellows and Ursula Dronke here gloss &quot;hörgr&quot; as &quot;temples&quot;):


In the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; Gagnráðr (the god Odin in disguise) engages in a game of wits with the jötunn Vafþrúðnir. Gagnráðr asks Vafþrúðnir whence the Van god Njörðr came, for though he rules over many hofs and hörgar, Njörðr was not raised among the Æsir (Benjamin Thorpe here glosses &quot;hörgr&quot; with &quot;offer-steads&quot; and Bellows glosses with &quot;shrines&quot;):

In the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, the goddess Freyja speaks favorably of Óttar for having worshiped her so faithfully by using a hörgr. Freyja details that the hörgr is constructed of a heap of stones, and that Óttar very commonly reddened these stones with sacrificial blood (Thorpe glosses &quot;hörgr&quot; with &quot;offer-stead&quot;, Bellows with &quot;shrine&quot;, and Orchard with &quot;altar&quot;):


===Epigraphic===
The place name Salhøgum, that is mentioned on a 9th-century Danish runestone known as the Snoldelev Stone, has a literal translation which combines Old Norse &quot;sal&quot; meaning &quot;hall&quot; with &quot;hörgar&quot; &quot;mounds,&quot; to form &quot;on the hall mounds,&quot; suggesting a place with a room where official meetings took place. The inscription states that the man Gunnvaldr is the &quot;þula&quot; of Salhøgum, which has been identified as referring to the modern town Salløv, located in the vicinity of the original site of the runestone.

===Toponymy===
Many place names in Iceland and Scandinavia contain the word hörgr or hörgur, such as Hörgá and Hörgsdalur in Iceland and Harg in Sweden. When Willibrord Christianized the Netherlands (~700 AD) the church of Vlaardingen had a dependency in Harago/Hargan, currently named Harga. This indicates that near those places there was some kind of religious building in medieval times.

==Old English tradition==
In the interpretation of Wilson, &quot;Anglo-Saxon Paganism&quot; (1992), 
&quot;hearg&quot; refers to &quot;a special type of religious site, one 
that occupied a prominent position on high land and was a communal place of worship for a specific group of people, a tribe or folk group, perhaps at particular times of the year&quot;, while 
a &quot;weoh&quot;, by contrast, was merely a small shrine by the wayside.

&quot;Beowulf&quot; has the compound &quot;hærgtrafum&quot; in the so-called &quot;Christian excursus&quot; (lines 175–178a), translated as &quot;tabernacles of idols&quot; by Hall (1950).

Following the regular evolution of English phonology, Old English &quot;hearg&quot; has become &quot;harrow&quot; in modern English placenames (unrelated to the homophone &quot;harrow&quot; &quot;agricultural implement&quot;).
The London Borough of Harrow derives its name from a temple on Harrow Hill, where St. Mary&#x27;s Church stands today. 
The name of Harrow on the Hill (&quot;Harewe atte Hulle&quot;) was adopted into Latin as &quot;Herga super montem&quot;; the Latinized form of the Old English name is preserved in the name of &quot;Herga Road&quot; in Harrow.

<text>Nathaniel Thomas Wilson (born July 20, 1968), better known by his stage name Kool G Rap (or simply G Rap), is an American rapper. He began his career in the mid-1980s as one half of the group Kool G Rap &amp; DJ Polo and as a member of the Juice Crew. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential and skilled MCs of all time, and a pioneer of mafioso rap/street/hardcore content and multisyllabic rhyming. On his album &quot;The Giancana Story&quot;, he stated that the &quot;G&quot; in his name stands for &quot;Giancana&quot; (after the mobster Sam Giancana), but on other occasions he has stated that it stands for &quot;Genius&quot;.

He has also been cited as a major influence on some of hip-hop&#x27;s most critically acclaimed figures, such as the Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Eminem and Jay-Z, as well as many underground rappers.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Wilson grew up in the poverty-ridden streets of Corona, Queens, New York City, with legendary producer Eric B. In an interview with &quot;The Source&quot; he stated;

Around this time, Wilson was looking for a DJ, and through Eric B., he met DJ Polo, who was looking for an MC to collaborate with.

=== Kool G Rap and DJ Polo ===
Juice Crew producer Mr. Magic and DJ Marley Marl allowed Polo and Kool G Rap to go to their studio to record a demo, which resulted in the song &quot;It&#x27;s a Demo&quot;. The song was written and recorded in one night, and had Marley so impressed, that he instantly embraced Kool G Rap and DJ Polo as Juice Crew members. In 1986, the duo appeared on Mr. Magic&#x27;s Rap Attack radio show on 107.5. They eventually released &quot;It&#x27;s a Demo&quot; as a single with &quot;I&#x27;m Fly&quot;, along with two more singles. Shortly after this, Kool G Rap appeared on the Juice Crew&#x27;s classic posse cut &quot;The Symphony&quot; before they released their debut album, &quot;Road to the Riches&quot; in 1989. This album and their two later albums, &quot;&quot; (1990) and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1992), are highly regarded and considered hip-hop classics. Eventually, in 1993, Kool G Rap parted ways with DJ Polo to pursue a solo career.

=== Solo career ===
In 1995, Wilson started his solo career with the album &quot;4, 5, 6&quot;, which featured production from Buckwild, and guest appearances from Nas, MF Grimm and B-1. It has been his most commercially successful record, reaching No. 24 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. This was followed by &quot;Roots of Evil&quot; in 1998. In 1997, G Rap was featured on Frankie Cutlass&#x27; &quot;Politics &amp; Bullshit&quot; album, on a track entitled &quot;Know Da Game&quot; which also featured Mobb Deep. In addition, Kool G featured on the Big Pun track &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot; and on Cuban Link&#x27;s posse cut &quot;Men of Business&quot; which also featured N.O.R.E., Lord Tariq, and M.O.P.

He then planned to release his next album, &quot;The Giancana Story&quot;, on Rawkus Records in 2000. Due to several complications with the record label, the album release date was pushed back several times, and the album was eventually released in 2002. &quot;My Life&quot;, the single from the album, featuring Talk Box legend G-Wise, reached No. 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 Rap singles charts. Kool G Rap and his group 5 Family Click then released a joint album, Click of Respect, on Kool G Rap&#x27;s own Igloo Ent. record label in 2003, to mild success. There were rumors of Kool G Rap&#x27;s signing to both Rocafella and G-Unit Records, and at one point Maybach Music Group. In 2007, he released &quot;Half a Klip&quot; on Chinga Chang Records, featuring production from, among others, DJ Premier and Marley Marl. A full LP was released in 2011, &quot;Riches, Royalty, Respect&quot; showcasing his true to form style and lyricism. The promise and prospects of collaboration albums were announced later the next year on his own, newly formed label FullMettle. The first of these new projects came in 2018 with the album &quot;Son of G Rap&quot; with Rochester, New York based rapper 38 Spesh.

In later years, Kool G Rap&#x27;s interests extended outside hip-hop. He stated in further interviews his desire to begin writing movie scripts, an ambition taken in for a few years as he sought out various collaborators, and as well as his desire to work on a clothing line at one point.

== Legacy ==
Kool G Rap is regarded as a hugely influential golden age rapper. Music journalist Peter Shapiro suggests that he &quot;created the blueprint for Nas, Biggie and everyone who followed in their path&quot;. Kool G is described by Kool Moe Dee as &quot;the progenitor and prototype for Biggie, Jay-Z, Treach, N.O.R.E., Fat Joe, Big Pun, and about twenty-five more hard-core emcees&quot;, and Kool Moe Dee also claims Kool G Rap is &quot;the most lyrical&quot; out of all of the artists mentioned. MTV describes Kool G Rap as a &quot;hip-hop godfather&quot;, adding that he paved the way for a lot of MCs who we would not have heard of otherwise. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; says, &quot;G Rap excelled at the street narrative, a style that would come to define later Queens MCs like Nas (who was hugely influenced by G Rap on his early records) and Mobb Deep&quot;.

Other artists who have named Kool G Rap as a major influence include the Notorious B.I.G., Eminem, Jay-Z, Tajai of Souls of Mischief, Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks, Steele of Smif-N-Wessun, Havoc of Mobb Deep, Rock of Heltah Skeltah, MC Serch, Termanology, Black Thought of the Roots, M.O.P., R.A. the Rugged Man, Bun B of UGK, Rah Digga; RZA, Ghostface Killah, and Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan; Big Pun, O.C. of D.I.T.C., Memphis Bleek, Kurupt, Pharoahe Monch of Organized Konfusion, Action Bronson, and Twista, among others.

He is also often very highly rated in terms of his technical ability and is often ranked alongside other highly regarded golden age MCs, such as Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, and KRS-One. In Jay-Z&#x27;s track &quot;Encore&quot;, Jay-Z raps, &quot;hearing me rap is like hearing G Rap in his prime&quot;. Allmusic calls him &quot;one of the greatest rappers ever&quot;, &quot;a master&quot;, and &quot;a legend&quot;.

A number of rappers, such as Ice Cube, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Lloyd Banks, and Nas have put him in their lists of favorite rappers. Kool Moe Dee ranked Kool G Rap at No. 14 in his book &quot;There&#x27;s A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs&quot;, and MTV gave him an &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; in their &quot;Greatest MCs of All Time&quot; list.

=== Rhyme technique ===
Kool G Rap is known for using complex multisyllabic rhymes since his debut, and this remains a hallmark of his style, along with his rapid-fire delivery and &quot;superhuman breath control&quot;. He is known for rapping with as many multisyllabic rhymes as possible.

He has also been cited as one of hip-hop&#x27;s greatest storytellers, alongside Slick Rick and Notorious B.I.G., with &quot;laser-like visual descriptions&quot;, and &quot;vivid narratives&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; states that, &quot;&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; continued G Rap&#x27;s reign as rap music&#x27;s premier yarn-spinner&quot;.

Kool G Rap provided the foreword for the 2009 book &quot;How to Rap: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC&quot;, in which he also provided insight into his rhyming technique.

=== Mafioso rap ===
Kool G Rap is often credited as the first rapper to infuse his lyrics with mafioso and hardcore street content.
This can be seen as early as 1989 in the song &quot;Road to the Riches&quot; where he makes a reference to Al Pacino (who played Michael Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot; and mobster Tony Montana in the 1983 crime drama movie &quot;Scarface&quot;) – this was long before albums such as Raekwon&#x27;s &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…&quot; (1995), and Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1996) made such references popular.

Since his debut, he has used various references to mob movies in his lyrics, album covers, and titles. For example, the album cover of &quot;Roots of Evil&quot; (1998) uses elements from &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot; theatrical posters, and &quot;The Giancana Story&quot; (2002) album title references Mafia boss Sam Giancana.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; says, &quot;before Kool G Rap, New York didn&#x27;t really have the street rap that could hold its own against what artists such as L.A.&#x27;s Ice-T and N.W.A were churning out&quot; and that &quot;G Rap excelled at the street narrative&quot;.

His take on crime, violence, and the mafioso lifestyle ranges from remorse and contemplation (e.g. &quot;Streets of New York&quot;, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;a vivid look inside the misery of the hood&quot;) to glorification (e.g. &quot;Fast Life&quot; featuring Nas).

Inspired by both Italian films of mafioso and thriller content and street narrative, G Rap laid the popular foundations of both rhyme and flow regarding mafioso rap and underground story telling.

<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner&#x27;s]] classification
is a classification of the nonnegative formula_1 energy irreducible unitary representations of the Poincaré group which have either finite or zero mass eigenvalues. (These unitary representations are infinite-dimensional; the group is not semisimple and it does not satisfy Weyl&#x27;s theorem on complete reducibility.) It was introduced by Eugene Wigner, to classify particles and fields in physics—see the article particle physics and representation theory. It relies on the stabilizer subgroups of that group, dubbed the [[Group action (mathematics)#Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups|Wigner little groups]] of various mass states.

The Casimir invariants of the Poincaré group are formula_2 (Einstein notation) where is the 4-momentum operator, and formula_3 where is the Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector. The eigenvalues of these operators serve to label the representations. The first is associated with mass-squared and the second with helicity or spin.

The physically relevant representations may thus be classified according to whether
* formula_4
* formula_5 but formula_6 or whether
* formula_5 with formula_8
Wigner found that massless particles are fundamentally different from massive particles.

; For the first case: Note that the eigenspace (see generalized eigenspaces of unbounded operators) associated with formula_9 is a representation of SO(3).
In the ray interpretation, one can go over to Spin(3) instead. So, massive states are classified by an irreducible Spin(3) unitary representation that characterizes their spin, and a positive mass, .
; For the second case: Look at the stabilizer of
:formula_10
This is the double cover of SE(2) (see projective representation). We have two cases, one where irreps are described by an integral multiple of called the helicity, and the other called the &quot;continuous spin&quot; representation.
; For the third case: The only finite-dimensional unitary solution is the trivial representation called the vacuum.

== Massive scalar fields ==

As an example, let us visualize the irreducible unitary representation with formula_11 and formula_12 It corresponds to the space of massive scalar fields.

Let be the hyperboloid sheet defined by:

:formula_13 formula_14

The Minkowski metric restricts to a Riemannian metric on , giving the metric structure of a hyperbolic space, in particular it is the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space, see geometry of Minkowski space for proof. The Poincare group acts on because (forgetting the action of the translation subgroup with addition inside ) it preserves the Minkowski inner product, and an element of the translation subgroup of the Poincare group acts on
formula_15
by multiplication by suitable phase multipliers
formula_16
where formula_17 These two actions can be combined in a clever way using induced representations to obtain an action
of acting on formula_18 that combines motions of and phase multiplication.

This yields an action of the Poincare group on the space of square-integrable functions defined on the hypersurface in Minkowski space. These may be viewed as measures defined on Minkowski space that are concentrated on the set defined by

:formula_19 formula_20

The Fourier transform (in all four variables) of such measures yields positive-energy, finite-energy solutions of the Klein–Gordon equation defined on Minkowski space, namely

:formula_21

without physical units. In this way, the formula_22 irreducible representation of the Poincare group is realized by its action on a suitable space of solutions of a linear wave equation.

==Theory of projective representations==
Physically, one is interested in irreducible &quot;projective&quot; unitary representations of the Poincaré group. After all, two vectors in the quantum Hilbert space that differ by multiplication by a constant represent the same physical state. Thus, two unitary operators that differ by a multiple of the identity have the same action on physical states. Therefore the unitary operators that represent Poincaré symmetry are only defined up to a constant—and therefore the group composition law need only hold up to a constant.

According to Bargmann&#x27;s theorem, every projective unitary representation of the Poincaré group comes from an ordinary unitary representation of its universal cover, which is a double cover. (Bargmann&#x27;s theorem applies because the double cover of the Poincaré group admits no non-trivial one-dimensional central extensions.)

Passing to the double cover is important because it allows for half-odd-integer spin cases. In the positive mass case, for example, the little group is SU(2) rather than SO(3); the representations of SU(2) then include both integer and half-odd-integer spin cases.

Since the general criterion in Bargmann&#x27;s theorem was not known when Wigner did his classification, he needed to show by hand (§5 of the paper) that the phases can be chosen in the operators to reflect the composition law in the group, up to a sign, which is then accounted for by passing to the double cover of the Poincaré group.

==Further classification==
Left out from this classification are tachyonic solutions, solutions with no fixed mass, infraparticles with no fixed mass, etc. Such solutions are of physical importance, when considering virtual states. A celebrated example is the case of deep inelastic scattering, in which a virtual space-like photon is exchanged between the incoming lepton and the incoming hadron. This justifies the introduction of transversely and longitudinally-polarized photons, and of the related concept of transverse and longitudinal structure functions, when considering these virtual states as effective probes of the internal quark and gluon contents of the hadrons. From a mathematical point of view, one considers the SO(2,1) group instead of the usual SO(3) group encountered in the usual massive case discussed above. This explains the occurrence of two transverse polarization vectors formula_23 and formula_24
which satisfy formula_25 and formula_26 to be compared with the usual case of a free formula_27 boson which has three polarization vectors formula_28 each of them satisfying formula_29

<text>Macadamia is a genus of four species of trees in the flowering plant family Proteaceae. They are indigenous to Australia, native to northeastern New South Wales and central and southeastern Queensland specifically. Two species of the genus are commercially important for their fruit, the macadamia nut (or simply macadamia). Global production in 2015 was . Other names include Queensland nut, bush nut, maroochi nut, bauple nut and, in the US, they are also known as Hawaii nut. It was an important source of bushfood for the Aboriginal peoples.

The nut was first commercially produced on a wide scale in Hawaii, where Australian seeds were introduced in the 1880s, and for more than a century they were the world&#x27;s largest producer. South Africa has been the world&#x27;s largest producer of the macadamia since the 2010s. 

The macadamia is the only widely grown food plant that is native to Australia.

==Description==
&quot;Macadamia&quot; is an evergreen genus that grows tall.

The leaves are arranged in whorls of three to six, lanceolate to obovate or elliptic in shape, long and broad, with an entire or spiny-serrated margin. The flowers are produced in a long, slender, and simple raceme long, the individual flowers long, white to pink or purple, with four tepals. The fruit is a hard, woody, globose follicle with a pointed apex containing one or two seeds. The nutshell (&quot;coat&quot;) is particularly tough and requires around 2000 N to crack. The shell material is five times harder than hazelnut shells and has mechanical properties similar to aluminum. It has a Vickers hardness of 35.

==Taxonomy==

=== Species ===
Nuts from &quot;M. jansenii&quot; and &quot;M. ternifolia&quot; contain cyanogenic glycosides. The other two species are cultivated for the commercial production of macadamia nuts for human consumption.

Previously, more species with disjunct distributions were named as members of this genus &quot;Macadamia&quot;. Genetics and morphological studies published in 2008 show they have separated from the genus &quot;Macadamia&quot;, correlating less closely than thought from earlier morphological studies. The species previously named in the genus &quot;Macadamia&quot; may still be referred to overall by the descriptive, non-scientific name of macadamia.

=== Etymology ===
The German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller gave the genus the name &quot;Macadamia&quot; in 1857 in honour of the Scottish-Australian chemist, medical teacher, and politician John Macadam, who was the honorary Secretary of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria beginning in 1857.

== Cultivation ==
The macadamia tree is usually propagated by grafting. It does not begin to produce commercial quantities of seeds until it is 7–10 years old, but once established, it may continue bearing for over 100 years. Macadamias prefer fertile, well-drained soils, a rainfall of , and temperatures not falling below (although once established, they can withstand light frosts), with an optimum temperature of . The roots are shallow, and trees can be blown down in storms; like most Proteaceae, they are also susceptible to &quot;Phytophthora&quot; root disease. As of 2019, the macadamia nut is the most expensive nut in the world, which is attributed to the slow harvesting process.

=== Cultivars ===

==== Beaumont ====
A &quot;Macadamia integrifolia&quot; / &quot;M. tetraphylla&quot; hybrid commercial variety is widely planted in Australia and New Zealand; Dr. J. H. Beaumont discovered it. It is high in oil but is not sweet. New leaves are reddish, and flowers are bright pink, borne on long racemes. It is one of the quickest varieties to come into bearing once planted in the garden, usually carrying a useful crop by the fourth year and improving from then on. It crops prodigiously when well pollinated. The impressive, grape-like clusters are sometimes so heavy they break the branchlets to which they are attached. Commercial orchards have reached per tree by eight years old. On the downside, the macadamias do not drop from the tree when ripe, and the leaves are a bit prickly when one reaches into the tree&#x27;s interior during harvest. Its shell is easier to open than that of most commercial varieties.
==== Maroochy ====
A pure &quot;M. tetraphylla&quot; variety from Australia, this strain is cultivated for its productive crop yield, flavour, and suitability for pollinating &#x27;Beaumont.&#x27;

==== Nelmac II ====
A South African &quot;M. integrifolia&quot; / &quot;M. tetraphylla&quot; hybrid cultivar, it has a sweet seed, which means it must be cooked carefully so that the sugars do not caramelise. The sweet seed is usually not fully processed, as it generally does not taste as good, but many people enjoy eating it uncooked. It has an open micropyle (hole in the shell), which may let in fungal spores. The crack-out percentage (ratio of nut meat to the whole nut by weight) is high. Ten-year-old trees average per tree. It is a popular variety because of its pollination of &#x27;Beaumont,&#x27; and the yields are almost comparable.

==== Renown ====
A &quot;M. integrifolia&quot; / &quot;M. tetraphylla&quot; hybrid, this is a rather spreading tree. On the plus side, it is high-yielding commercially; from a 9-year-old tree has been recorded, and the nuts drop to the ground. However, they are thick-shelled, with not much flavour.

==Production==
In 2024, South Africa was the leading producer of macadamia nuts, with 77,000 tonnes, up from 54,000 tonnes out of global production of 211,000 tonnes in 2018. Macadamia is commercially produced in many countries of Southeast Asia, South America, Australia, and North America having Mediterranean, temperate or tropical climates.

===History===
The first commercial orchard of macadamia trees was planted in the early 1880s by Rous Mill, southeast of Lismore, New South Wales, consisting of &quot;M. tetraphylla&quot;. Besides the development of a small boutique industry in Australia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, macadamia was extensively planted as a commercial crop in Hawaii from the 1920s onward. Macadamia seeds were first imported into Hawaii in 1882 by William H. Purvis, who planted seeds that year at Kapulena. The Hawaiian-produced macadamia established the well-known seed internationally, and in 2017, Hawaii produced over 22,000 tonnes.

In 2019, researchers collected samples from hundreds of trees in Queensland and compared their genetic profiles to samples from Hawaiian orchards. They determined that essentially all the Hawaiian trees must have descended from a small population of Australian trees from Gympie, possibly just a single tree. This lack of genetic diversity in the commercial crop puts it at risk of succumbing to pathogens (as has happened in the past to banana cultivars). Growers may seek to diversify the cultivated population by hybridizing with wild specimens.

===Shelling===
Macadamias are the world&#x27;s hardest edible nut to crack. Since ordinary nutcrackers apply insufficient force, various types of specialist macadamia nut crackers are available, many of which apply force to the micropyle (white dot) to fracture the shell.

For commercial scale deshelling, rotating steel rollers are used. In South Africa, the average crack-out rate, meaning the ratio of usable nut to discarded shell, is 27.6% nut to 72.4% waste.

== Toxicity ==
Nuts from &quot;M. jansenii&quot; and &quot;M. ternifolia&quot; contain cyanogenic glycosides. 

===Allergen===
Macadamia allergy is a type of food allergy to macadamia nuts which is relatively rare, affecting less than 5% of people with tree nut allergy in the United States. Macadamia allergy can cause mild to severe allergic reactions, such as oral allergy syndrome, urticaria, angioedema, vomiting, abdominal pain, asthma, and anaphylaxis. Macadamia allergy can also cross-react with other tree nuts or foods that have similar allergenic proteins, such as coconut, walnut, hazelnut, and cashew. The diagnosis and management of macadamia allergy involves avoiding macadamia nuts and their derivatives, reading food labels carefully, carrying an epinephrine auto-injector in case of severe reactions, and consulting a doctor for further testing and advice.

===Toxicity in dogs and cats===
Macadamias are toxic to dogs. Ingestion may result in macadamia toxicity marked by weakness and hind limb paralysis with the inability to stand, occurring within 12 hours of ingestion. It is not known what makes macadamia nuts toxic in dogs. Depending on the quantity ingested and the size of the dog, symptoms may also include muscle tremors, joint pain, and severe abdominal pain. In high doses of toxin, opiate medication may be required for symptom relief until the toxic effects diminish, with full recovery usually within 24 to 48 hours.

Macadamias are also toxic to cats, causing tremors, paralysis, joint stiffness, and high fever.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===
Raw macadamia nuts are 1% water, 14% carbohydrates, 76% fat, and 8% protein. A 100-gram reference amount of macadamia nuts provides 740 kilocalories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value (DV)) of numerous essential nutrients, including thiamine (104% DV), vitamin B6 (21% DV), other B vitamins, manganese (195% DV), iron (28% DV), magnesium (37% DV) and phosphorus (27% DV).

Compared with other common edible nuts, such as almonds and cashews, macadamias are high in total fat and relatively low in protein. They have a high amount of monounsaturated fats (59% of total content) and contain, as 17% of total fat, the monounsaturated fat, omega-7 palmitoleic acid.

=== Other uses ===
The trees are also grown as ornamental plants in subtropical regions for their glossy foliage and attractive flowers. The flowers produce a well-regarded honey. The wood is used decoratively for small items. &quot;Macadamia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Batrachedra arenosella&quot;.

Macadamia seeds are often fed to hyacinth macaws in captivity. These large parrots are among the few animals, other than humans, capable of cracking the shell and removing the seed.

<doc id="309407" wikidata="Q1051317" url="?curid=309407" title="Catsuit">
<text>A catsuit is a one-piece form-fitting garment that covers the torso and the legs, and frequently the arms. They are usually made from stretchable material, such as lycra, chiffon, spandex (after 1959), latex, or velour, but may use less elastic materials, such as leather or PVC. Catsuits frequently close by means of a zipper at the front or back. A catsuit is regarded as outerwear, but not normally street wear. Catsuits are also used for sexualization or other types of sexuality.

==History and use==

Catsuits were occasionally worn as a fashion item at various times from the 1960s to the 1990s. During the 1970s and 1980s, they were worn for aerobics and disco dancing. Around 1980, disco dance catsuits briefly became a street fashion item in the United Kingdom.

Athletes in sports such as speed skating, bobsled, winter triathlon, ski-racing, cycling, bodyflight, skysurfing and gymnastics wear garments similar to catsuits, called unitards, which are specifically geared to the needs of the sport involved. Also similar in appearance are wetsuits and drysuits used by scuba divers, and the speedsuits used by competitive swimmers before the more extreme forms of the suit were banned. Also, in tennis Serena Williams would sometimes wear catsuits, two examples are the 2002 US Open and the 2018 French Open.

The name &quot;catsuit&quot; is attributed only since about 1955 or 1960. Originally, they were called bodysuits. The origin of the name is unknown; it may refer to a slinky, catlike aspect given the wearer by some versions. It may also relate to the association with antiheroine Catwoman whose costume from the 1950s onward is a modified catsuit.

==In popular culture==

The catsuit is often worn in movies, television, music videos, and computer games.

* In comics and their movie adaptations, catsuits are often worn by superheroes and supervillains, including the iconic Catwoman; other examples include Black Cat, Batgirl and Black Panther.
* Scarlett Johansson wears a catsuit portraying Natasha Romanoff-Black Widow in several films, beginning with &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010). 
* The lead female characters of the &quot;Underworld&quot; film series and &quot;The Matrix&quot; wore catsuits.
* Female villains and heroines in spy films may wear catsuits, such as the Baroness and Scarlett in &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;.
* An iconic use of catsuits in popular media was on the British television show &quot;The Avengers&quot;, where Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman) and Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) wore tight leather catsuits; leather was chosen because it lit well in studio lighting and did not split during action scenes.
* Shirley Bassey wore a sleeveless chiffon catsuit for a gatefold album photograph, and in concert.
* Cher has worn catsuits in concert.
* In popular culture, catsuits have become the stereotypical costume of dominatrixes.
* Lara Croft, heroine of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; franchise, has worn catsuits in specific segments in &quot;Tomb Raider 3&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider: Chronicles&quot;.
* In the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; TV series, the Vulcan commander T&#x27;Pol (portrayed by Jolene Blalock) wore a uniform sometimes described as a catsuit.
* The music video of Liberty X&#x27;s 2002 smash hit &quot;Just a Little&quot; features two of its members, Jessica Taylor and Kelli Young, wearing tight black latex catsuits. On occasions where the group has performed the song live on television, both Taylor and Young wear their catsuits from the original music video. In 2013, when the group performed during the Big Reunion, both members wore a different design of their catsuits.
* Taylor Swift wore a snake-patterned catsuit for the &quot;Reputation&quot; act of her Eras Tour.

<text>Robots and Empire is a science fiction novel by the American author Isaac Asimov, published by Doubleday Books in 1985. It is part of Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series, which consists of many short stories (collected in &quot;I, Robot&quot;, &quot;The Rest of the Robots&quot;, &quot;The Complete Robot&quot;, &quot;Robot Dreams&quot;, &quot;Robot Visions&quot;, and &quot;Gold&quot;) and five novels (including &quot;The Positronic Man&quot;, &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;, and &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;).

&quot;Robots and Empire&quot; is part of Asimov&#x27;s consolidation of his three major series of science fiction stories and novels into a single future history: his &quot;Robot&quot; series, his &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; series and his &quot;Foundation&quot; series. (Asimov also carried out this unification in &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; and its sequel.)

In the novel, Asimov depicts the transition from his earlier Milky Way Galaxy, inhabited by both human beings and positronic robots, to his Galactic Empire. The galaxy of his earlier trilogy of &quot;Robot&quot; novels is dominated by the blended human/robotic societies of the fifty &quot;Spacer&quot; planets, dispersed through the near-Earth part of the Galaxy. While the Earth is much more populous than all of the Spacer planets combined, its people are looked down upon and treated almost as sub-human by the Spacers. For a long time, the Spacers have forbidden immigration of people from the Earth. But Asimov&#x27;s later Galactic Empire is populated by many quadrillions of human beings on hundreds of thousands of habitable planets and by very few robots (such as R. Daneel Olivaw). Even the technology to maintain and upgrade robots exists on only a few out-of-the-way planets. Therefore, this novel attempts to describe how his earlier &quot;Robot&quot; series ultimately connects to his &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
The Earthman Elijah Baley (the detective hero of the previous &quot;Robot&quot; books) has died nearly two centuries earlier. During these two centuries, Earth-people have overcome their agoraphobia and resumed space colonization, using faster-than-light drive to reach distant planets beyond the earlier &quot;Spacer&quot; worlds. Their inhabitants, calling themselves &quot;Settlers&quot; rather than &quot;Spacers&quot;, revere Earth as their mother-world.

Baley&#x27;s memory remains in the mind of his former lover, Gladia Delmarre, a long-lived &quot;Spacer&quot; who uncharacteristically relocated from the spacer world of Solaria to Aurora. Gladia&#x27;s homeworld and the 50th-established of the Spacer planets, Solaria, has become empty of all human inhabitants, although millions of robot servants remain. A seventh-generation descendant of Baley&#x27;s, Daneel Giskard (&#x27;D.G.&#x27;) Baley, gains Gladia&#x27;s help in visiting Solaria, to investigate the destruction of several &quot;Settler&quot; spaceships that made landings there and to capture the presumably unsupervised robots. Gladia is accompanied by the positronic robots R Daneel Olivaw and R Giskard Reventlov, both the former property of their creator, Dr Han Fastolfe, who bequeathed them to Gladia in his will. R Giskard has secret telepathic powers of which only R Daneel knows.

At the same time, Daneel and Giskard are engaged in a struggle of wits with Fastolfe&#x27;s rivals: The roboticists Kelden Amadiro and Vasilia Aliena, Fastolfe&#x27;s estranged daughter. Frustrated by his series of failures, Amadiro accepts an ambitious and unscrupulous apprentice, Levular Mandamus, who plans to destroy the population of the Earth by a newly developed weapon, the &quot;nuclear intensifier&quot;, with which to accelerate the natural radioactive decay in the upper crust of the Earth, thereby making the surface of the Earth radioactive. R Daneel and R Giskard discover the roboticists&#x27; plan and attempt to stop Amadiro; but are hampered by the First Law of Robotics,

which prevents them from a direct attack on Amadiro. Daneel and Giskard, meanwhile, have inferred an additional Zeroth Law of Robotics:

It might enable them to overcome Amadiro, if they can use their telepathic perception of humanity to quell the inhibitions of the first law. When Vasilia accuses Giskard of telepathy (earlier created by herself), Giskard is compelled to manipulate her mind to make her forget about his telepathic powers. The two robots locate Amadiro and Mandamus on Earth, at the site of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania. After Amadiro admits their plans, Giskard alters Amadiro&#x27;s brain (using the newly created Zeroth Law); but in so doing, threatens his own.

Now alone with the robots, Mandamus claims that his intentions were to draw out the radioactive catastrophe over many decades, rather than the mere years that Amadiro wanted, and Giskard, believing it best for humanity to abandon the Earth, allows Mandamus to do this (resulting in the situation depicted in &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;), and deprives Mandamus of the memory of doing so. Giskard predicts, correctly, that by forcing humanity into leaving the Earth, vigor will be reintroduced into humankind and the new Settlers will populate space until all the governments of the interstellar colonies form a &quot;Galactic Empire&quot;. Under the stress of having violated the First Law (in accordance with the Zeroth Law, but with the predicted benefit to humanity being uncertain), R Giskard himself suffers a soon-fatal malfunction of his positronic brain, but manages to confer his telepathic ability upon R Daneel.

==Novel==
In his memoir &quot;I. Asimov&quot; (1994), Asimov explained that following his commercial and critical success with &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;, he decided to write &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; with the intentions of making Daneel, &quot;the real hero of the series&quot;, the novel&#x27;s protagonist, and that &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; would create a bridge to the later volumes of his future history. About this second aim, Asimov said that he was dissuaded by Lester del Rey and Judy-Lynn del Rey, his long-time friends and the editors of Del Rey Books, who thought that the fans of Asimov&#x27;s series of novels would rather that Asimov kept the &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot;/&quot;Foundation&quot; universes separate. On the other hand, his editors at Doubleday, his hardcover book publisher, encouraged Asimov to do what deep down he wanted to do. From then on, Asimov proceeded with his plans for unifying the two series.

Asimov organized &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; nonlinearly. (Other examples of nonlinear plotting in Asimov&#x27;s novels can be found in &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; and &quot;Nemesis&quot;.) Flashbacks by the major characters alternate with the present-time storyline. The story starts on the Spacer planet Aurora, where the heart of Amadiro&#x27;s conspiracy against Settler civilization is developing. Meanwhile, aboard a starship, Gladia, Daneel, and Giskard visit the planets Solaria and Baleyworld before reaching the Earth, where this novel&#x27;s climax takes place.

Asimov used a planet-hopping itinerary in most of the volumes of the &quot;Foundation&quot; series from &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; onward. Unlike the detective fiction methods of the previous Robot novels, where Baley assembles the clues to a crime that had been committed, in &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; a murderous conspiracy developing against the Earth, and its discovery by the robots, keep pace with each other right up through the final confrontation with Amadiro on the Earth. Then, the robots have only moments to spare in terminating Amadiro&#x27;s plan for a quick death to all Earthlings.

As well as linking the two series into a single future history, the present book served to address a criticism levelled against the largely radioactive Earth depicted in &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; and mentioned in several other books. Though not explicitly stated, there was the clear implication that the world&#x27;s being mostly radioactive with humans precariously surviving in limited uncontaminated areas was the result of a nuclear war hundreds or thousands of years before the time of the plot. This would have made &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; part of the post-nuclear war subgenre common in the 1950s. It was, however, pointed out by critics that such an extensive use of nuclear weapons as to leave persistent and widespread radiation even after centuries would have completely destroyed all life on Earth at the moment when it took place. Therefore, in the present book Asimov provided a different origin for the future Earth&#x27;s radioactivity.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #85, and stated that &quot;Asimov always perks up when chopping logic with the Three Laws of Robotics, and here his robots come up with a Fourth, or rather Zeroth, Law. This works out approximately as &#x27;the end justifies the means&#x27;. For some reason the author doesn&#x27;t even seem mildly worried by the implications...&quot;

<doc id="309409" wikidata="Q753894" url="?curid=309409" title="Foundation (Asimov novel)">
<text>Foundation is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. It is the first book in the &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot; (which later expanded into the &quot;Foundation&quot; series). &quot;Foundation&quot; is a cycle of five interrelated short stories, first published as a single book by Gnome Press in 1951. Collectively they tell the early story of the Foundation, an institute founded by psychohistorian Hari Seldon to preserve the best of galactic civilization after the collapse of the Galactic Empire.

== Publication history ==
On August 1, 1941, Isaac Asimov proposed to John W. Campbell of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; that he write a short story set in a slowly declining Galactic Empire, based on the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Campbell liked the idea, and by the end of a two-hour meeting Asimov planned to write a series of stories depicting the fall of the first Galactic Empire and the rise of the second. Asimov wrote seven more stories for Campbell&#x27;s magazine over eight years, and they were later collected into three book volumes known as &quot;The Foundation Trilogy&quot; (1951–1953).

Of these, &quot;Foundation&quot; (retitled as &quot;The Encyclopedists&quot; for the book collection) was published in &quot;Astounding&quot; in May 1942; &quot;Bridle and Saddle&quot; (retitled &quot;The Mayors&quot; for the collection) in June 1942; &quot;The Big and the Little&quot; (retitled &quot;The Merchant Princes&quot; for the collection) in August 1944; and &quot;The Wedge&quot; (retitled &quot;The Traders&quot; for the collection) in October 1944. Collected as &quot;Foundation&quot; in 1951, these four stories were accompanied by &quot;The Psychohistorians&quot;, a book-exclusive prologue story. The remaining four novellas were collected as &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; (1952) and &quot;Second Foundation&quot; (1953).

&quot;The Foundation Trilogy&quot; won a Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966.

==Plot summary==
===&quot;The Psychohistorians&quot;===
In 12,067 G.E. (&quot;Galactic Era&quot;), mathematician and psychologist Hari Seldon has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that allows for the probabilistic prediction of future events. By means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the decline and eventual fall of the Galactic Empire, angering its rulers, the Commission of Public Safety. Seldon defends his beliefs, and the Commission, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, Terminus.

===&quot;The Encyclopedists&quot;===
In 50 F.E. (&quot;Foundation Era&quot;), there is one region on Terminus that is suitable for the development of a large city, named Terminus City. The affairs of Terminus City are handled by its first Mayor, Salvor Hardin. Hardin believes Terminus is in danger of political exploitation by the four neighboring prefectures of the Empire. When Hardin&#x27;s efforts are resisted by the Board, Hardin and his chief advisor, Yohan Lee, plan an overthrow of the ruling board. Because the board was made up of Encyclopedists whose training was authoritarian, they could not recognize the possibility of revolt.
Salvor Hardin then visited the three kingdoms each weaker than Anacreon, and convinced them that they must resist nuclear power from falling into Anacreon alone. The three issued a joint ultimatum that all be allowed to receive nuclear technology from Terminus City, ensuring that the Encyclopedists were indispensable to all.

===&quot;The Mayors&quot;===
In the kingdom of Anacreon, Prince Regent Wienis and his teenage nephew, King Lepold I, launch a direct military assault against Terminus, making use of an abandoned Imperial battlecruiser. Hardin secretly installs a kill switch into the cruiser, causing the crew to mutiny. The ship&#x27;s commander, Admiral Prince Lefkin, Wienis&#x27;s son, is captured and forced to broadcast a message to Anacreon. The message demands Wienis&#x27;s arrest and trial before an ecclesiastical court. Wienis, maddened by his failure, orders Hardin&#x27;s execution, but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him. Attempting and failing, due to a protective energy field, to kill Hardin personally, Wienis shoots himself.

===&quot;The Traders&quot;===
Master Trader Eskel Gorov, an agent of the Foundation government, travels to the world of Askone, hoping to trade atomics. Gorov, however, is met with resistance by Askone&#x27;s governing Elders due to traditional taboos that effectively ban advanced technology. Gorov is imprisoned and sentenced to death.

Trader Limmar Ponyets is ordered by the Foundation to try to negotiate with the Elders. He meets with the Elders&#x27; Grand Master and deduces that he may be willing to exchange Gorov for a suitable bribe. Ponyets clumsily fashions a transmuter that will convert iron into gold. Councilor Pherl, the Grand Master&#x27;s protégé, believes that a stable supply of gold will increase his power, and Ponyets sells him the transmuter.

Gorov is released quickly. According to a new agreement, he and Ponyets can take as much tin from Pherl&#x27;s mines as they can carry.

===&quot;The Merchant Princes&quot;===
Three Foundation vessels have vanished near the Republic of Korell, which is suspected of either independent technological development or buying smuggled Foundation goods. Master Trader Hober Mallow is assigned to deal with Korell. He talks to Jaim Twer and invites him to come along. While the Master Trader and his crew are waiting in a spaceport hangar, a man identifying himself as &quot;Reverend Jord Parma&quot; appears, saying he is a missionary. Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries to be on the planet under penalty of death. Suspecting a set-up, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them.

Mallow&#x27;s discoveries lead him to believe that the Empire has been providing weapons to client states. He journeys alone to the planet Siwenna, which he believes may be the capital of an Imperial province. He meets the impoverished patrician Onum Barr, who helps Mallow to understand the political situation.

A year after his return to Terminus, Mallow is tried for murder because he gave the Foundation missionary to the mob. He reveals his knowledge that Jaim Twer was working as an agent for Sutt, one of the men who sent Mallow to Korell. Further, he produces a recording revealing that the &quot;missionary&quot; was in fact a Korellian secret policeman. Acquitted, Mallow is received with delight by the population of Terminus, which ensures him the Mayor&#x27;s seat. Mallow has Sutt and Manlio arrested. 

As Mayor, Mallow soon faces tension with Korell, which declares war on the Foundation. Mallow imposes an embargo on Korell. The Korellan economy collapses due to its dependency on Foundation technology, thus forcing its surrender.

==Reception==
Writing after the 1951 publication of the five stories as a single book, reviewer Groff Conklin declared &quot;Foundation&quot; &quot;a book of real intellectual entertainment and adventure&quot;, while Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas found it &quot;competent enough writing and thinking, if on the dull side.&quot; At the same time, P. Schuyler Miller received the volume favorably, but noted that the &quot;revision and inter-writing&quot; of the component stories was &quot;not quite so successful a job&quot; as Asimov had managed with &quot;I, Robot&quot;. In 1966, the &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy won the Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series.

Writing in 2011, &quot;Gizmodo&quot; singled out &quot;The Psychohistorians&quot; as &quot;the perfect introduction to the &quot;Foundation&quot; series, a mini-masterpiece of world-building that helps you understand exactly what the Foundation is trying to do and, more importantly, why it all matters in slightly more than abstract terms.&quot; &quot;io9&quot; included the book on its 2012 list of &quot;10 Science Fiction Novels You Pretend to Have Read&quot;. 

Although Hugo Awards were established only in 1953, too late for the novel to be eligible, all four stories originally published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; were later retroactively nominated for Retro-Hugo Awards, one of them winning the 1943 Retro-Hugo Award for the Best Novelette (of 1942): 
* the novelette &quot;Foundation&quot; (later retitled into the chapter &quot;The Encyclopedists&quot;) won a retrospective 1943 Hugo Award for the Best Novelette (of 1942) in 2018;
* &quot;Bridle and Saddle&quot; (later retitled into the chapter &quot;The Mayors&quot;) was 5th among the novelettes nominated for a retrospective 1943 Hugo Award for the Best Novelette (of 1942) in 2018;
* &quot;The Wedge&quot; (later retitled into the chapter &quot;The Traders&quot;) was 4th among the short stories nominated for a retrospective 1945 Hugo Award for the Best Short Story (of 1944) in 2020.
* &quot;The Big and the Little&quot; (later retitled into the chapter &quot;The Merchant Princes&quot;) tied for the 5th place among novelettes nominated for a retrospective 1945 Hugo Award for the Best Novelette (of 1944) in 2020.

<doc id="309412" wikidata="Q430698" url="?curid=309412" title="Darkseid">
<text>Darkseid () is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer-artist Jack Kirby, the character first made a cameo appearance in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; #134 (December 1970), before being fully introduced in &quot;Forever People&quot; #1 (February 1971).

Formerly known as Uxas, Darkseid is a New God and the tyrannical ruler of the planet Apokolips. His ultimate goal is to find and gain control over the Anti-Life Equation to enslave the multiverse by eliminating all hope and free will in sentient beings. Regarded as one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, Darkseid serves as one of Superman&#x27;s greatest adversaries and the archenemy of the Justice League.

Darkseid has been adapted in various media incarnations, having made his live-action feature debut in the 2021 DC Extended Universe film &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;, portrayed by Ray Porter. Michael Ironside, Andre Braugher, Tony Todd, and others have provided the character&#x27;s voice in media ranging from animation to video games.

==Publication history==
Darkseid was created by writer-artist Jack Kirby to serve as the chief antagonist of his &quot;Fourth World&quot; metaseries. The character was first seen briefly in a series of cameos that started in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; #134 (December 1970), before making his first full appearance in &quot;Forever People&quot; #1 (February 1971). Kirby modeled Darkseid&#x27;s face on actor Jack Palance and based his personality on Adolf Hitler and Richard Nixon.

Though Darkseid was originally conceived as the primary villain for the New Gods, he would eventually be established as an archenemy of Superman and the Justice League.

Darkseid has had a large influence in pop culture and other comics; most notably, Kirby&#x27;s creation is credited as the inspiration for Marvel Comics&#x27; high-profile villain Thanos by his creators.

Mark Evanier, who spent several years as Kirby&#x27;s assistant, has stated that &#x27;Darkseid&#x27; is pronounced &quot;As if spelled &#x27;dark side,&#x27; as in &#x27;the dark side of man&#x27;s nature&#x27;&quot;, noting that this was &quot;how Kirby always pronounced it around me&quot;; however, Evanier has also stated that &quot;at least once, when some fan who pronounced it &#x27;dark seed&#x27; was excitedly telling [Kirby] his theories about the character, [Kirby] went along with it, rather than correct the kid.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
Prince Uxas, the son of King Yuga Khan and Queen Heggra and the second-in-line to the throne of Apokolips, plotted to seize control over the planet from his older brother, Drax. When Drax attempted to claim the fabled Omega Force, Uxas murdered him and claimed its power for himself. His skin turned to stone, and Uxas rechristened himself as Darkseid. At some point, he fell in love with an Apokoliptian scientist and sorceress named Suli, with whom he had a son, Kalibak. However, Heggra ordered Desaad to poison Suli out of the belief that she was corrupting her son.

Following Suli&#x27;s death, Darkseid&#x27;s heart grew even colder and his disdain for his mother intensified when she forced him to marry a woman named Tigra, with whom he had another son, Orion. Seeking vengeance against Heggra for killing the one he loved, Darkseid ordered Desaad to poison her so he could finally become the supreme monarch of Apokolips. Darkseid then tried to force Tigra to eliminate Orion, but the latter was ultimately traded with Highfather&#x27;s son, Scott Free, as part of a peace treaty between the warring planets of Apokolips and New Genesis. This trade eventually became a setback for Darkseid, with Orion growing up to value and defend the ideals of New Genesis as a powerful champion in opposition to his father. The prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of Orion in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of Apokolips. Likewise, Darkseid and his training minion, Granny Goodness, were unable to break Scott Free&#x27;s spirit after a long, torturous upbringing and Free ultimately managed to escape Apokolips, taking with him the Female Fury Big Barda, as his wife. Free, now known as the superhero Mister Miracle, and Barda began living on Earth, and Darkseid used this &quot;betrayal&quot; as a pretext to declare the treaty with New Genesis abrogated so the planets could resume their conflict.

Darkseid&#x27;s goal was to eliminate all free will from the universe, supplanting the Presence as its Supreme Being. To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious Anti-Life Equation, which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion Glorious Godfrey, who could control people&#x27;s minds with his voice. He had a special interest in Earth, as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation.

Darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many superheroes of the DC Universe, most notably the Kryptonian Superman. Darkseid worked behind the scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through Intergang, a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later becomes a religious cult that worships Darkseid.

===The Great Darkness Saga===

One thousand years in the future, Darkseid has been absent for centuries and is almost completely forgotten. He returns and comes into conflict with that era&#x27;s champions, the Legion of Super-Heroes. After using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power, Darkseid transposes the planets Apokolips and Daxam—which places Daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants Kryptonian-like superpowers equal to those of Superman. Placing the Daxamites under his mental thrall, he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe. However, he is eventually defeated by the Legion and many of its allies.

Seeing other deities as a threat, Darkseid invades Themyscira to discover the secret location of the Olympian deities, planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power. Refusing to aid Darkseid in his mad quest, the Amazons battled his Parademon troops, causing half of the Amazon population&#x27;s death. Wonder Woman was able to gain her revenge against Darkseid for killing so many of her sisters by placing a portion of her own soul into Darkseid. This supposedly weakened the god&#x27;s power as he lost a portion of his dark edge.

===The Seven Soldiers and &quot;Boss Dark Side&quot;===
In Grant Morrison&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; limited series, it was revealed that Darkseid had finally discovered the Anti-Life Equation, which he then used to destroy the Fourth World altogether. The New Gods fled to Earth, where they hid. Highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people. Metron used a wheelchair, the Black Racer was an old white man in a wheelchair, DeSaad was an evil psychiatrist, Granny Goodness was a pimp (or &quot;madam&quot;) for the Female Furies and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as &quot;Boss Dark Side&quot;. It is revealed that Darkseid actually gave the Sheeda North America in return for Aurakles, Earth&#x27;s first superhero. This was, in turn, purely for Darkseid to get Shilo Norman, whom he considers the &quot;Avatar of Freedom&quot;, in his clutches so that he could eventually destroy the New Gods.

===Final Crisis===

As prophesied, Orion returns to Earth via boom tube for his final battle with Darkseid. During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, which created a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid&#x27;s chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having &quot;won&quot; the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid&#x27;s life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as &quot;Boss Dark Side&quot;, aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain Libra.

Once again bound to the form of a human, &quot;Boss Dark Side&quot; began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. In &quot;The Flash&quot; vol. 2 #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the &quot;spoken form&quot; of the Anti-Life Equation, to kidnap the Tornado Twins. In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by Bernadeth. In &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #59, it was revealed that he had employed the Terror Titans to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the Multiverse with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and antichrist-like figure who soon converts much of the Secret Society of Super Villains to his cause with the aid of the Crime Bible and the Holy Lance. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as Mary Marvel.

Darkseid also arranges for detective Dan Turpin to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid&#x27;s &quot;final host&quot;, as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid&#x27;s foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest &quot;rebirth&quot;, Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin&#x27;s mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid&#x27;s essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment Shilo Norman, the &quot;Embodiment of Freedom&quot; is shot by S.H.A.D.E. operatives, thus signalling the &quot;Victory of Evil&quot;. Darkseid wins control over Turpin&#x27;s body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his &quot;fall&quot; having the effect of compressing and crumpling spacetime around Earth.

After escaping from captivity, Batman shoots Darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Beam, sending him back in time and then &quot;infecting&quot; Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into prehistoric times. Remains believed to be Batman&#x27;s (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid&#x27;s fall through the multiverse, he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence. When Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the Anti-Life Equation and that killing Darkseid will kill humanity. Darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him, to kill Orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time (a move Superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions: the bullet used to kill Orion is ultimately fired at him by Batman and is now poisoning him to death).

Before Darkseid can use the Omega Effect to kill Superman, Barry Allen and Wally West lead the Black Racer to Darkseid and making contact with him frees Turpin from Darkseid&#x27;s control. Wonder Woman (having been freed from possession by one of Darkseid&#x27;s minions) then uses her lasso of truth to bind Darkseid&#x27;s spirit form, effectively freeing humanity from the Anti-Life Equation and being controlled by Darkseid. In his final effort, Darkseid&#x27;s disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the Miracle Machine Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid&#x27;s plan fails when Batman escapes the Omega Sanction.

Doctor Impossible later manipulates the Crime Syndicate of America into helping him resurrect Darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the Multiverse itself. The resurrection backfires and creates a new being known as the Omega Man.

===The New 52===

In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Darkseid&#x27;s name is first invoked by a Parademon in &quot;Justice League&quot; #1. He is later mentioned again in &quot;Justice League&quot; #2, and in &quot;Justice League&quot; #3 Darkseid makes his first appearance in the series, seen in a vision by Victor Stone after he is injured by an exploding Mother Box. In the final pages of &quot;Justice League&quot; #4, Darkseid himself appears. In &quot;Justice League&quot; #5, the League confronts him but they are overpowered by him, when he severely hurts Superman with his Omega Beams and breaks Green Lantern&#x27;s arm. Finally, in &quot;Justice League&quot; #6, Darkseid is driven out when Cyborg activates the invaders&#x27; Mother Boxes and Superman forces him through a boom tube. The incidents that occur in these issues make Darkseid the first foe the newly formed League faces as a team. The issue also reveals DeSaad and Steppenwolf, referring to Darkseid&#x27;s daughter and their ceaseless search for her across countless worlds. Darkseid&#x27;s daughter escapes containment in &quot;Justice League of America&#x27;s Vibe&quot; #7 after the dampeners on her cage are temporarily disabled.

In the New 52 continuity, there is only one set of New Gods across the 52 Multiverse. So as Darkseid invades Prime Earth in &quot;Justice League&quot;, he sends his lieutenant Steppenwolf to do the same, with greater success, on Earth 2, resulting in the deaths of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, and stranding Helena Wayne and Kara Zor-L on Prime Earth. Five years later, Darkseid once again invades Earth 2, which never fully recovered from his armies&#x27; earlier assault, and it is revealed that he and Highfather of New Genesis struck a deal allowing him the unchallenged right to invade Earth 2.

In &quot;Darkseid&quot; #1, his background story was revealed. Formerly a farmer named Uxas, he hated the deities of his world. So he traveled up to their mountain while they slept and tricked them all into fighting each other. As they were all weakened from the war, he killed them one by one with his scythe (similar to Kronos of Greek mythology) and stole their power, before destroying his world and creating Apokolips.

In &quot;Justice League: The Darkseid War&quot; (after the retirement of the &quot;New 52&quot; imprint), Darkseid comes into conflict with the Anti-Monitor. Darkseid&#x27;s daughter Grail leads the Anti-Monitor, who is revealed to be a scientist named Mobius, to Darkseid for the former to kill the latter. Mobius believes that with the death of Darkseid, he will be free from being the Anti-Monitor. After an intense battle, the Anti-Monitor fuses the Black Racer with Flash and sends it after Darkseid. Using the fused Flash and his own powers, he kills Darkseid. With Darkseid dead, the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its God of Evil. Lex Luthor later fuses with the Omega Sanction, becoming the new ruler of Apokolips.

After killing the Anti-Monitor using an Anti-Life Equation-powered Steve Trevor, Grail would later resurrect Darkseid through the newborn child of Superwoman. The child has the same powers as his father Mazahs, with the ability to steal the powers of others. Stealing the new &quot;God&quot; abilities of the Justice League, Grail fuses them with the child and brings Darkseid back to life. However, he is under her complete control. Grail later attempts to redeem herself by seemingly killing Darkseid with the Anti-Life Equation. However, it is later revealed that she reincarnated him back as a baby with the intention of teaching him differently.

In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Darkseid kills Zeus and absorbs his power to return to his original form.

===New Justice===
After countless alien planets being held captive by Brainiac&#x27;s race are freed, they venture into an unknown area of outer space called the &quot;Ghost Sector.&quot; After remembering a prophecy his father told him, and noticing the crack in the Source Wall, Darkseid lures Cyborg, Starfire, and Azrael to the Ghost Sector in an attempt to use their powers to
conquer the Multiverse.

Being successful with the team&#x27;s entrapment, Darkseid reveals to Cyborg that a bond was established between them, when Cyborg merged with Darkseid&#x27;s Mother Box. According to the prophecy, the alien worlds were hidden because of the Old Gods they worshipped.

===Infinite Frontier ===
In &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, Darkseid is trapped in Earth-Omega following the restoration of the multiverse. He regained his original form by fusing with his alternate universe counterparts. Darkseid&#x27;s former henchmen reunite with him on Earth-Omega and remain by his side as he gains a new follower named X-Tract, Cameron Chase&#x27;s Earth-Two counterpart.

Darkseid battles the Justice League Incarnate, but is defeated by the Great Hand and sent to a mysterious place where he is controlled by Pariah and the Great Darkness. He is freed after Nightwing fends off the Great Darkness and returns to Apokolips.

=== DC All In ===
In &quot;DC All In&quot;, Darkseid bonds with the Spectre using the Miracle Machine before allowing himself to be killed in battle with the Justice League to become unbound from time and space. He travels to another universe and corrupts it with his influence, transforming it into the Absolute Universe.

<text>Charles Arthur Salvador (born Michael Gordon Peterson; 6 December 1952; formerly known as Charles Ali Ahmed) better known by his professional name of Charles Bronson, is a British artist and criminal, with a violent and notorious life as a prisoner. He has spent periods detained in the Rampton, Broadmoor, and Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospitals.

First arrested as a petty criminal, he was convicted and sentenced in 1974 to seven years&#x27; imprisonment for armed robbery. Further sentences were imposed because of attacks on prisoners and guards. Upon his release in 1987, he began a bare-knuckle boxing career in the East End of London. His promoter thought he needed a more suitable name and suggested he change it to Charles Bronson, after the American actor. He was returned to prison in 1988 on conviction concerning another robbery. He is a violent prisoner, and has taken numerous hostages in the course of confrontations with guards, resulting in sentences of life imprisonment. He has been held at times in each of England&#x27;s three special psychiatric hospitals.

Bronson has been featured in books, interviews, and studies of prison reform and treatment. He has said: &quot;I&#x27;m a nice guy, but sometimes I lose all my senses and become nasty. That doesn&#x27;t make me evil, just confused.&quot; He was the subject of the 2008 film &quot;Bronson&quot;, a biopic based loosely on his life, starring Tom Hardy as Bronson, with Kairon Scott Busuttil and William Darke playing him as a child.

Bronson has written many books about his experiences and the famous prisoners he has met throughout his incarceration. A fitness fanatic who has spent many years in segregation from other prisoners, Bronson wrote a book about exercising in confined spaces. He is an artist; paintings and illustrations of prison and psychiatric hospital life have been exhibited and won him awards.

In 2014, he changed his name again, this time to Charles Salvador, in a mark of respect to Salvador Dalí, one of his favourite artists. The Charles Salvador Art Foundation was founded to promote his artwork and &quot;help those in positions even less fortunate than his own&quot; to participate in art. In 2023, his application for parole was rejected.

== Life ==
===Early life===

Born Michael Gordon Peterson in Luton, Bedfordshire, he was one of three sons of Eira ( Parry) and John G. Peterson. His father later ran the Conservative club in Aberystwyth. His uncle and aunt each served as mayor of Luton in the 1960s and 1970s. 

His aunt, Eileen Parry, is quoted as saying: &quot;As a boy, he was a lovely lad. He was obviously bright and always good with children. He was gentle and mild-mannered, never a bully; he would defend the weak&quot;.

Peterson lived in Luton from the age of four. When he was a teenager, his family moved to Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, where he started getting into trouble. At the age of 13, he was part of a gang of four robbers and was reprimanded in juvenile court after he was caught stealing. He enjoyed fighting from an early age, and was often absent from school. Peterson later returned to Luton, which he refers to as his home town. His first job was at Tesco, which lasted a fortnight before he was dismissed for attacking his manager. He passed through a number of jobs, working as a hod carrier and in a number of factories. He was imprisoned for the first time at Risley, serving time on remand for criminal damage after he smashed some parked cars following an argument with his girlfriend&#x27;s father. Following his trial, he was fined and given probation.

Peterson worked as a furniture remover, while regularly fighting on his nights out. After being involved in petty crime, he was in serious trouble with the authorities for the first time after crashing a stolen lorry into a car. He was apprehended in his parents&#x27; home, from the scene of the incident. The driver of the car survived the collision, resulting in Bronson not facing serious penalty, receiving fines and probation. After his trial, he returned to petty crime and menial labour. Aged 19, Bronson was convicted for his part in a smash and grab raid. The judge gave him a suspended sentence.

He met Irene Kelsey in 1971, who described him as &quot;so different from any other boys I knew. He always wore tailored suits, had perfectly-groomed sideburns and a Cockney accent.&quot; Eight months later in 1972, when Kelsey was four months pregnant, the couple married at Chester Register Office. Their son is Michael Jonathan Peterson. Five years later they divorced, and Kelsey later remarried.

=== 1974–1987 ===

Bronson was convicted of armed robbery in 1974, aged twenty two, and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. He was sent to Walton Gaol, and soon ended up in the punishment block after attacking two prisoners without being provoked. He was transferred to Hull in 1975. After refusing prison work, he smashed up a workshop after an altercation with a prison officer, and was sent to the punishment block. He was injected with the sedative chlorpromazine, which made him violently ill, and six months were added to his sentence. 

After recovering, he continued to prove a highly challenging inmate, and was repeatedly placed in solitary confinement for several months. He attacked fellow prisoner John Henry Gallagher with a glass jug, and was charged with grievous bodily harm. Charges were later dropped to unlawful wounding, and he was convicted. Nine months were added to his sentence. He was transferred to Armley Gaol.

Peterson found that his reputation as a violent and highly dangerous inmate preceded him. During 1975 to 1977, he was switched between Armley, Wakefield, Parkhurst, and Walton prisons. He was taken from Yorkshire to London chained to the floor of a prison van. Kept in solitary confinement, he began a fitness programme. He continued to attack other convicts and damage prison property. While recovering in solitary from a beating given to him for punching two prison officers, Bronson was handed the divorce papers filed by his wife.

At Wandsworth, he attempted to poison the prisoner in the cell next to him. He was moved to Parkhurst Prison in 1976, where he befriended the Kray twins, whom he described as &quot;the best two guys I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;. He was moved back to Wandsworth after threatening to kill a prison officer. He spent four months in isolation after he was caught trying to dig his way out of his cell. After being returned to the prison&#x27;s general population, he caught up with the prisoner who had informed on his escape plan, and attacked him, scarring him for life. 

The governor at Wandsworth wanted to transfer Bronson out of his facility, and only the C Unit Psychiatric Wing at Parkhurst was willing to accept him. Bronson was returned to the Isle of Wight. There he attacked a prisoner with a jam jar, and was again charged with grievous bodily harm. He attempted suicide and attacked another prison officer, and was made subject to a transfer direction order under the Mental Health Act.

In December 1978, Bronson arrived at Broadmoor, but was soon transferred to Rampton Secure Hospital. Unable to adapt to forced medication, and in the company of highly disturbed and highly dangerous patients, Bronson attempted to strangle child rapist and murderer John White. He was apprehended just as White was giving out his death rattle. Bronson was returned to Broadmoor, where he reunited with Ronnie Kray.

At Broadmoor, Bronson attempted to strangle Gordon Robinson to death, but was prevented from doing so by the tearing of the silk tie he was using. Following this failure, Bronson became depressed, but found his spirits lifted when Ronnie Kray arranged a visit from boxer Terry Downes. In 1982, he performed his first rooftop protest after escaping to the top of Broadmoor, tearing off roof tiles. Not long after the first incident, he again reached the roof of Broadmoor. He caused £250,000 worth of damage in a three-day protest, before he was talked down by his family.

Following further treatment, he took up art. Eventually he received more prison awards than any other inmate for his poems, prose, and cartoons. He made a third rooftop protest, this time demanding a prison transfer, and was again talked down. He began an 18-day-long hunger strike, and was eventually granted a transfer to Ashworth Hospital, then known as Park Lane Hospital, in June 1984.

Though Bronson was more settled in the more modern facilities and regime at Ashworth, he soon returned to his previous behaviour. He used a sauce bottle to stab Mervin Horley, a patient who made sexual advances towards him. He was returned to the general prison population at Risley Remand Centre in 1985, and was placed in isolation after punching a fellow inmate. In May 1985, Bronson pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm for the attack on Horley, and three years were added to his sentence. Later in the year he was returned to Walton, where he made another three-day rooftop protest, causing £100,000 worth of damage. Authorities added another year to his sentence. He was moved to Albany, where he punched another convict on his first day in general prison population. He was quickly moved to Wormwood Scrubs. Two weeks later he was returned to Wandsworth.

In 1986, Bronson was transferred eight times, the only new location being Winchester. He strangled the governor of Wormwood Scrubs during one particularly violent episode. On 3 January 1987, he was transferred to Gartree, where he served the rest of his sentence in isolation, other than ten days spent in nearby Leicester Prison.

===1987–1999===
Upon his release from Gartree, Peterson was met by his family and stayed with his parents for a few days in Aberystwyth. He took a train to London, bought a water pistol, modified it, and used it to intimidate a stranger into driving him to Luton. Bronson embarked on a short-lived career in illegal bare-knuckle boxing in the East End of London on the advice of long-time friend Reggie Kray. He changed his name from Michael Peterson to Charles Bronson in 1987 on the advice of his fight promoter, Paul Edmonds, although he had never seen a film starring the American actor Charles Bronson. He offered to fight Lenny McLean, but was refused. He said that he killed a rottweiler with his bare hands in a £10,000 underground fight. Later he said that this was &quot;not something I&#x27;m proud of because I love animals.&quot;

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1988, to the surprise of his girlfriend Alison, he robbed a jewellery shop, kept a ring for her, and sold the rest. On 7 January 1988, his 69th day of freedom, he was apprehended and arrested on his morning jog. The arresting officers charged him under his fighting name, Charles Bronson, and he decided at that moment to give up the name Michael Peterson. He was returned to Leicester Prison, as Bedford Prison refused to house him on account of his uncontrollable behaviour during his first term of imprisonment. 

His defence had looked strong, as eyewitnesses refused to testify due to fear of reprisals. Alison retracted her initial testimony and became the prosecution&#x27;s main witness. This removed Bronson&#x27;s alibi, and gave the prosecution all the evidence needed to win the case. Bronson made a failed bid to reach the prison&#x27;s roof, and was transferred to Brixton. At Brixton, Bronson was placed in a top-secure unit of 16 prisoners. In June 1988, he pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced to seven years.

Bronson was taken to Wandsworth, before being transferred to Full Sutton. There he spent time in isolation for punching a prisoner and a prison officer, and throwing water on the governor. He spent a month at Durham, where he bonded with a family of rodents that crept into his cell. In 1989, he was moved to Long Lartin, and seemed to settle at the prison. He eventually &quot;went over the edge&quot; and ran riot in the nude, clutching a spear he fashioned out of a broken bottle and a broom handle. After another incident in which Bronson ran amok, he was placed in isolation. 

He spent two months at Bristol, before being moved to Birmingham, Winchester, and back to Wandsworth in September 1989. He was regularly moved and frequently in trouble, particularly so when he punched two prison officers at Gartree and took the Deputy Governor hostage at Frankland. At Parkhurst, he was on the receiving end of an attack, when at least two prisoners stabbed him in the back several times. Bronson refused to speak to the police about it. He recovered from the attack without further incidents, and was released from prison in November 1992.

Bronson spent 53 days as a free man before being arrested, this time for conspiracy to rob. He was remanded at the newly opened Woodhill Prison. He insisted that his girlfriend Kelly-Anne, her friend Carol, and her lover were lying to the police in order to get him locked away. On 9 February 1993, the charges of robbery were dismissed. He was given a £600 fine for breaking the nose of Kelly-Anne&#x27;s lover. Sixteen days later, he was arrested for conspiracy to rob and for possession of a sawn-off shotgun. On remand in Woodhill, he took a civilian librarian hostage, and demanded an inflatable doll, a helicopter, and a cup of tea from police negotiators. He released the hostage after being disgusted when the man farted in front of him.

Bronson was taken from Belmarsh to Bullingdon Prison for his trial. He pleaded guilty to possessing the shotgun, but not guilty for the conspiracy charges. He told the jury he had intended to use the shotgun to blow his head off. On 14 September 1993, he was found guilty of &#x27;intent to rob&#x27; and not guilty of conspiracy to rob. His co-defendant was found not guilty of all charges. Bronson was given an eight-year sentence.

Bronson was taken from Belmarsh to Wakefield, where he spent 40 days naked in isolation. He was transferred to Hull in November, where he spent a number of months without incident. He took deputy governor Adrian Wallace hostage on Easter Monday 1994. He was overpowered by guards, and was transferred to Leicester. He was returned to Wakefield, where he was confined to what was known as the &quot;Hannibal Cage&quot;, previously occupied by Robert Maudsley. While there, prison officers Mick O&#x27;Hagan and Alan Jarvis encouraged Bronson to take up art, and he began to concentrate on cartooning.

His father died in September 1994, during a period when Bronson was in constant solitary confinement and was moved almost weekly. He attacked the governor at High Down, who had felt safe enough to visit Bronson on his own, telling his prison officers that &quot;he&#x27;s okay with me&quot;. At Lincoln, he was allowed to spend time with children with Down syndrome. He was taken out of solitary and placed back on the prison wings after getting along well with the children. He was returned to isolation after returning from 30-minutes&#x27; exercise, 30 minutes late.
In April 1996, he was sent back to Belmarsh after taking a doctor hostage at Birmingham. Five months later, an Iraqi hijacker bumped into him in the canteen and did not apologise. After a long period of brooding, Bronson took two other Iraqi hijackers, along with another inmate named Jason Greasley, hostage in a cell. By his own admission, he was &quot;losing it badly&quot; and ranted about his dead father, saying that any &quot;funny business&quot; would result in him &quot;snapping necks&quot;. He sang and laughed and forced the Iraqis to tickle his feet and call him &#x27;General&#x27;.

He demanded a plane to take him to Libya, two Uzi sub-machine guns, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, and an axe. He released Greasley, but began chanting &quot;I want ice cream&quot;. He felt guilty after hitting one of the hostages with a metal tray and therefore insisted the same hostage hit him over the head four times so as to call it &#x27;quits&#x27;. He slashed himself four times with a safety razor, but agreed to release the hostages and walk back to the segregation unit. Another seven years were added to his sentence. This was reduced to five years on appeal.

In October 1996, Bronson was unsettled as he had an unexpected visit from Robert Taylor, a doctor, instead of his regular lawyer. He took Taylor hostage, but released him 30 minutes later after coming to his senses. Taylor refused to assist a prosecution.

In January 1999, he took Phil Danielson, a civilian education worker, hostage, as he had criticised one of Bronson&#x27;s drawings. Bronson tore up the prison, throwing refrigeration units and furniture around. He was shocked and knocked unconscious for a few minutes when wrenching a washing machine out of the wall. The siege lasted for 44 hours before he released Danielson. Bronson was transferred to Whitemoor.

For the incident, Bronson received a discretionary life sentence to run a minimum of three years. Later in 1999, a special prison unit was set up at Woodhill for Bronson, Robert Maudsley and Reginald Wilson, to reduce the risk they posed to staff and other prisoners. Danielson received £65,000 in compensation from the Home Office in an out-of-court settlement, although the prison service did not admit liability for its negligence in failing to protect a civilian employee.

===2001–present===
In 2001, Bronson married again, this time in HMP Woodhill to Fatema Saira Rehman, a Bangladeshi-born divorcee. She had seen his picture and an article about him in a newspaper and began writing to him. Rehman had visited Bronson ten times before they married. She had worked at a women&#x27;s shelter before they met, but lost her job when her employer found out about the relationship. 

For a short time, Bronson converted to his wife&#x27;s faith of Islam, and wished to be known as Charles Ali Ahmed, but did not change his name legally. After four years he and Rehman divorced, and he renounced Islam. During this period, Bronson appealed against his life sentence. Three appeal court judges rejected the application in April 2004. In court, with six prison guards surrounding him, Bronson said his wife and her daughter were helping to rehabilitate him, and references about his character, including reports from psychiatrists, were positive on this occasion.

In 2007, two prison staff members at Full Sutton high security dispersal prison in the East Riding of Yorkshire were involved in a &quot;control and restraint incident&quot;, in an attempt to prevent another hostage situation, during which Bronson had his tinted glasses broken. Bronson received £200 compensation for his broken glasses.

Bronson remained a Category A prisoner when he was moved to Wakefield High-Security Prison. He was due for a parole hearing in September 2008. This was postponed when his lawyer objected to a one-hour parole interview, requesting a full day to deal with Bronson&#x27;s case. The parole hearing took place on 11 March 2009, with the board refusing parole shortly afterwards.

In August 2013, a petition with 10,000 signatures was presented to 10 Downing Street calling for his release. In an enclosed note, Bronson appealed to prime minister David Cameron for him to be able to &quot;live what&#x27;s left of my life and not be buried in the prison system&quot;.

On 28 February 2014, Bronson violently attacked the prison governor in a television room in HMP Woodhill, over a dispute that his mail was being withheld, including two letters from his mother. The governor had serious bruising. In July 2014, Bronson was sentenced to two years. The prison accepted that his mail may have been unacceptably processed.

In August 2014, Bronson announced that he was changing his name via deed poll to Charles Salvador, in tribute to the artist Salvador Dalí. In a hand-written statement on his website, Salvador stated that &quot;The old me dried up... Bronson came alive in 1987. He died in 2014.&quot;

Under this new name, he began creating works of art described as &quot;fantasy reality&quot;. A collection of these works was auctioned in October 2014.

Salvador proposed to actress Paula Williamson, during a prison visit on 13 February 2017, and was accepted. She had been visiting him for five months. According to Williamson: &quot;Charlie is a changed man. It is my hope that he will be released by my 40th birthday, in August 2020&quot;. Williamson, who had minor roles in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, married Salvador in the prison chapel on 14 November 2017. 

In July 2018, it became known that Bronson asked for a divorce, after photo evidence of a young British holiday-goer &#x27;motorboating&#x27; on her chest and inviting him and his friends to her apartment, whilst on holiday in Tenerife, was leaked to a newspaper. She claimed he requested his wife to wear a catsuit when she next visited him, a suggestion she rejected. On 29 July 2019, Williamson, aged 38, was found dead at her home in Stoke-on-Trent. Her death was not considered suspicious by the police.

In 2017, Bronson contacted newspaper photographer George Bamby after recognising his name on a Channel 4 documentary. After meeting, Bronson gave Bamby hair samples for DNA testing. Bamby has since produced a certificate claiming that there is a 99.98% chance that he is Bronson&#x27;s son. In March 2023, however, Bamby later claimed the entire relationship was fabricated in a publicity stunt arranged between the two.

In November 2018, Bronson was found not guilty at Leeds Crown Court after being tried for attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. The incident the previous January had involved Mark Docherty, the governor at Wakefield prison. &quot;For the first time in 44 years in prison I never intended to be violent. I never meant to hurt the governor&quot;, Bronson told the court via Videolink, while defending himself. Shortly after his acquittal, he was moved to HM Prison Woodhill.

In June 2020, Bronson won a High Court battle for the right for his parole board meeting to be held in public, citing the right to a fair trial.

In early 2023, it was reported that Bronson would go before the parole board in March of that year. He was denied parole, with the parole board stating that it &quot;was not satisfied that Mr. Salvador was suitable for release. Nor did the panel recommend to the secretary of state that he should be transferred to an open prison.&quot;

== Occupations and projects ==
While in prison, Bronson developed a fitness regime and in 2008 claimed he could still do 172 press-ups in 60 seconds and 94 sit-ups in 30 seconds. In 2002, he published the book &quot;Solitary Fitness&quot;, detailing an individual training process with minimal resources and space.

Since 1999, Bronson has occupied himself by writing poetry and producing artworks. He has had eleven books published, including in 2008 his only self-penned book &quot;Loonyology: In My Own Words&quot;. He has won 11 Koestler Trust Awards for his poetry and art.

On 28 April 2010, BBC News reported that artwork by Bronson was displayed on the London Underground at Angel tube station from 26 April 2010 for two weeks. The display was organised by Art Below, which is unrelated to the official Transport For London art programme. The National Victims&#x27; Association, which represents families affected by crime, queried the desirability of allowing Bronson &quot;to engage with the British public in this way&quot;. His work was soon removed by an unknown party for unexplained reasons.

In 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the sale of several of Bronson&#x27;s artworks, which were formerly owned by Ronnie Kray, raised several thousand pounds for his mother to have a holiday. It followed her being upset after Bronson&#x27;s reported attack against 12 prison guards at HMP Woodhill.

In 2016, he auctioned one of his artworks to raise money for the treatment of a child with cerebral palsy.

In 2021, Bronson, under the name Charles Arthur Salvador, was featured on the single &quot;Only Mad Men Crawl&quot; by the Ayia Napa-based recording act Lost Vegas.

In 2023, Bronson put his drawings for sale at an exhibition, which he hoped could increase his chance for getting parole by demonstrating that he could have an occupation if released from prison.

==Biographical film==

The film, &quot;Bronson&quot;, which loosely follows Bronson&#x27;s life, was released in Britain on 13 March 2009. It stars Tom Hardy in the eponymous role, and is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Controversy was caused at the première when a recording of Bronson&#x27;s voice was played with no prior permission granted by officers at HM Prison Service, who called for an inquiry into how the recording had been made.

<doc id="309418" wikidata="Q1503873" url="?curid=309418" title="Code 39">
<text>Code 39 (also known as Alpha39, Code 3 of 9, Code 3/9, Type 39, USS Code 39, or USD-3) is a variable length, discrete barcode symbology defined in ISO/IEC 16388:2007.

The Code 39 specification defines 43 characters, consisting of uppercase letters (A through Z), numeric digits (0 through 9) and a number of special characters (-, ., $, /, +, %, and space). An additional character (denoted &#x27;*&#x27;) is used for both start and stop delimiters. Each character is composed of nine elements: five bars and four spaces. Three of the nine elements in each character are wide (binary value 1), and six elements are narrow (binary value 0). 

The barcode scheme does not contain a check digit (in contrast to—for instance—Code 128), but it can be considered self-checking on the grounds that a single erroneously interpreted bar cannot generate another valid character. Possibly the most serious drawback of Code 39 is its low data density: It requires more space to encode data in Code 39 than, for example, in Code 128. This means that very small goods cannot be labeled with a Code 39 based barcode. However, Code 39 is still used by some postal services (although the Universal Postal Union recommends using Code 128 in all cases), and can be decoded with virtually any barcode reader. One advantage of Code 39 is that since there is no need to generate a check digit, it can easily be integrated into an existing printing system by adding a barcode font to the system or printer and then printing the raw data in that font.

Code 39 was developed by Dr. David Allais and Ray Stevens of Intermec in 1974. Their original design included two wide bars and one wide space in each character, resulting in 40 possible characters. Setting aside one of these characters as a start and stop pattern left 39 characters, which was the origin of the name Code 39. Four punctuation characters were later added, using no wide bars and three wide spaces, expanding the character set to 43 characters. Code 39 was later standardised as ANSI MH 10.8 M-1983 and MIL-STD-1189. MIL-STD-1189 has been cancelled and replaced by ANSI/AIM BC1/1995, Uniform Symbology Specification — Code 39.

== Encoding ==
The * character presented below is not a true encodable character, but is the start and stop symbol for Code 39. The asymmetry of the symbol allows the reader to determine the direction of the barcode being scanned. This code is traditionally mapped to the * character in barcode fonts and will often appear with the human-readable representation alongside the barcode.
As a generality, the location of the two wide bars can be considered to encode a number between 1 and 10, and the location of the wide space (which has four possible positions) can be considered to classify the character into one of four groups (from left to right): Letters(+30) (U–Z), Digits(+0) (1–9,0), Letters(+10) (A–J), and Letters(+20) (K–T). For example, the letter P (being the 16th letter of the alphabet) has its bars aligned to represent the number 6, and the space in the far right position to select the group Letters(+20).

When represented as a digit, the number &quot;10&quot; is used to encode the number zero. Because there are only six letters in the Letters(+30) group (letters 30–35, or U–Z), the other four positions in this group (36–39) are used to represent three symbols (dash, period, space) as well as the start/stop character.

The two wide bars, out of five possible positions, encode a number between 1 and 10 using a two-out-of-five code with the following numeric equivalence: 1, 2, 4, 7, 0. The numbers are summed together. For example, the number 6 is encoded NWWNN, with wide bars occupying the positions for 2 and 4 (2+4=6). In the case of NNWWN which is it is assigned to 0 for digits (+0), and 10 for the letter columns (+10 – +30). When encoding the (+10 to +30) letters the equation needs a &quot;−1&quot; added so &#x27;A&#x27; is WNNNW → 1 + 10 − 1 → 10 as shown in the table.

The last four characters consist of all narrow bars and three wide spaces. There are four possible positions for the single narrow space.

This table outlines the Code 39 specification. The numeric value assigned to each character (except start/stop) is used in the checksum algorithm described below.

Characters are separated by an additional narrow space. For example, the full encoding for the single letter &quot;A&quot;, which actually includes the start and stop characters as &quot;*A*&quot;, is . The code will not be read properly without these inter-character spaces. Barcode fonts invariably include this space within the glyph for the character.

== Code 39 check digit ==
Code 39 is sometimes used with an optional modulo 10 or 43 check digit. Using it requires this feature to be enabled in the barcode reader. The code with check digit is referred to as &quot;Code 39 mod 10&quot; or &quot;Code 39 mod 43&quot;, respectively.

To compute this, each character is assigned a value. The assignments are listed in the table above, and almost, but not quite, systematic.

To perform the checksum calculation —
* Take the value (0 through 42) of each character in the barcode, excluding start and stop codes.
* Sum the values.
* Divide the result by 10 (for Mod 10 check digit) or by 43 (for Mod 43 check digit).
* The remainder is the value of the checksum character to be appended.

== Full ASCII Code 39 ==
Code 39 is restricted to 43 characters. In Full ASCII Code 39 Symbols 0-9, A-Z, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;-&quot; and space are the same as their representations in Code 39. Lower case letters, additional punctuation characters and control characters are represented by sequences of two characters of Code 39.
==Software==

The following free and open source software can produce Code 39 barcodes:

* GNU Barcode.
* Zint and libzint.
* glbarcode++ and glabels

<text>A triose is a monosaccharide, or simple sugar, containing three carbon atoms. There are only three possible trioses: the two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde, which are aldoses; and dihydroxyacetone, a ketose which is symmetrical and therefore has no enantiomers. 

Trioses are important in cellular respiration. During glycolysis, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is broken down into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Lactic acid and pyruvic acid are later derived from these molecules.

Importance of Triose in the Body

* Trioses serve as metabolic intermediates in various different metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway.

* Trioses contribute to the synthesis of essential biomolecules including lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, and carbohydrates.
* Trioses are small carbon molecules and can therefore be easily modified into various molecules.

<text>Velour, occasionally velours, is a plush, knitted fabric or textile similar to velvet or velveteen. It can be made from polyester, spandex, cotton, or a cotton-polyester blend. Velour is used in a wide variety of applications, including clothing and upholstery. Velour typically has a medium-length pile, shorter than velvet but longer than velveteen.

==History and uses==
Velour originated in France, although it is unclear who first created it. Velour is a knitted fabric, which makes it stretchy (unlike velvet and velveteen, which are woven). Velour is soft, allows freedom of movement, and is used for activewear and loungewear. Historically, velour was cheaper than velvet and was thus often used for home furnishings and decor which would take heavy wear and tear. However, modern manufacturing techniques make velvet affordable for home furnishings. The low cost of velour allows for its use by people of all economic classes.

In the 1970s, velour gained popularity through clothing trends such as athleisure tracksuits.

<text>Phelsuma dubia, also known as dull day gecko, olive day gecko, Zanzibar day gecko or green day gecko, is a diurnal species of gecko. It is about in length and lives on the western coast of Madagascar, in the Comoros, and the coast of East Africa. It typically inhabits trees and can also be found near human dwellings. The Dull day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Scientific synonyms==
*&quot;Pachydactylus dubius&quot; 
*&quot;Phelsuma dubia&quot; - 
*&quot;Phelsuma dubia&quot; - : 298 
*&quot;Phelsuma dubia&quot; - : 10 
*&quot;Phelsuma dubia&quot; - : 101

==Description==
This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. It can reach a maximum length of approximately 15 cm. The body colour varies between grayish green, grayish brown and bluish green. The tail may be bright blue. A rust-coloured stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. There is a red v-shaped stripe on the snout. On the back there often are brownish or red-brick coloured dots. A gray lateral stripe extends from the eye to the hind leg. The ventral side is off-white coloured. Juveniles have a light brown dorsal surface with little light blue spots. The tail of neonates is yellow.

==Distribution==
This species inhabits the west coast of Madagascar in the general area of Majunga. It can also be found in the Comoros, in Zanzibar, and some coastal areas of mainland Tanzania.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. dubia&quot; can easily adapt to different biotopes. These day geckos are often found on different trees and other lowland vegetation. They also inhabit buildings as a human commensal.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen, nectar and balsamic vinegar.

==Behaviour==
&quot;P. dubia&quot; often lives in small groups with one male and several females.

==Reproduction==
The females are egg gluers. They often lay their eggs in the same location as other females.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
Phelsuma dubia is currently common and widespread. However, capture of these geckos is regulated, as it may have caused population declines and, as it is large-scale, might threaten the species in the future.

These animals should be housed in pairs and need a medium-sized terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28 °C. The humidity should be not too high. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth, fruit flies, meal worms and houseflies.

<doc id="309428" wikidata="Q726242" url="?curid=309428" title="RR Lyrae variable">
<text>RR Lyrae variables are periodic variable stars, commonly found in globular clusters. They are used as standard candles to measure (extra) galactic distances, assisting with the cosmic distance ladder. This class is named after the prototype and brightest example, RR Lyrae.

They are pulsating horizontal branch stars of spectral class A or F, with a mass of around half the Sun&#x27;s. They are thought to have shed mass during the red-giant branch phase, and were once stars at around 0.8 solar masses.

In contemporary astronomy, a period-luminosity relation makes them good standard candles for relatively nearby targets, especially within the Milky Way and Local Group. They are also frequent subjects in the studies of globular clusters and the chemistry (and quantum mechanics) of older stars.

==Discovery and recognition==

In surveys of globular clusters, these &quot;cluster-type&quot; variables were being rapidly identified in the mid-1890s, especially by E. C. Pickering. Probably the first star definitely of RR Lyrae type found outside a cluster was U Leporis, discovered by J. Kapteyn in 1890. The prototype star RR Lyrae was discovered prior to 1899 by Williamina Fleming, and reported by Pickering in 1900 as &quot;indistinguishable from cluster-type variables&quot;.

From 1915 to the 1930s, the RR Lyraes became increasingly accepted as a class of star distinct from the classical Cepheids, due to their shorter periods, differing locations within the galaxy, and chemical differences. RR Lyrae variables are metal-poor, Population II stars.

RR Lyraes have proven difficult to observe in external galaxies because of their intrinsic faintness. (In fact, Walter Baade&#x27;s failure to find them in the Andromeda Galaxy led him to suspect that the galaxy was much farther away than predicted, to reconsider the calibration of Cepheid variables, and to propose the concept of stellar populations.) Using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in the 1980s, Pritchet &amp; van den Bergh found RR Lyraes in Andromeda&#x27;s galactic halo and, more recently, in its globular clusters.

==Classification==
The RR Lyrae stars are conventionally divided into three main types, following classification by S.I. Bailey based on the shape of the stars&#x27; brightness curves:
* RRab variables are the most common, making up 91% of all observed RR Lyrae, and display the steep rises in brightness typical of RR Lyrae
* RRc are less common, making up 9% of observed RR Lyrae, and have shorter periods and more sinusoidal variation
* RRd are rare, making up between &lt;1% and 30% of RR Lyrae in a system, and are double-mode pulsators, unlike RRab and RRc

==Distribution==

RR Lyrae stars were formerly called &quot;cluster variables&quot; because of their strong (but not exclusive) association with globular clusters; conversely, over 80% of all variables known in globular clusters are RR Lyraes. RR Lyrae stars are found at all galactic latitudes, as opposed to classical Cepheids, which are strongly associated with the galactic plane.

Because of their old age, RR Lyraes are commonly used to trace certain populations in the Milky Way, including the halo and thick disk.

Several times as many RR Lyraes are known as all Cepheids combined; in the 1980s, about 1900 were known in globular clusters. Some estimates have about 85,000 in the Milky Way.

Though binary star systems are common for typical stars, RR Lyraes are very rarely observed in binaries.

==Properties==
RR Lyrae stars pulse in a manner similar to Cepheid variables, but the nature and histories of these stars is thought to be rather different. Like all variables on the Cepheid instability strip, pulsations are caused by the κ-mechanism, when the opacity of ionised helium varies with its temperature.

RR Lyraes are old, relatively low mass, Population II stars, in common with W Virginis and BL Herculis variables, the type II Cepheids. Classical Cepheid variables are higher mass population I stars. RR Lyrae variables are much more common than Cepheids, but also much less luminous. The average absolute magnitude of an RR Lyrae star is about +0.75, only 40 or 50 times brighter than the Sun. Their period is shorter, typically less than one day, sometimes ranging down to seven hours. Some RRab stars, including RR Lyrae itself, exhibit the Blazhko effect in which there is a conspicuous phase and amplitude modulation.

==Period-luminosity relationships==

Unlike Cepheid variables, RR Lyrae variables do not follow a strict period-luminosity relationship at visual wavelengths, although they do in the infrared K band. They are normally analysed using a period-colour-relationship, for example using a Wesenheit function. In this way, they can be used as standard candles for distance measurements although there are difficulties with the effects of metallicity, faintness, and blending. The effect of blending can impact RR Lyrae variables sampled near the cores of globular clusters, which are so dense that in low-resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target. Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star (e.g., an RR Lyrae variable) is erroneously too bright, given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined. Consequently, the computed distance is wrong, and certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder, and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant.

==Recent developments==
The Hubble Space Telescope has identified several RR Lyrae candidates in globular clusters of the Andromeda Galaxy and has measured the distance to the prototype star RR Lyrae.

The Kepler space telescope provided accurate photometric coverage of a single field at regular intervals over an extended period. 37 known RR Lyrae variables lie within the Kepler field, including RR Lyrae itself, and new phenomena such as period-doubling have been detected.

The Gaia mission mapped 140,784 RR Lyrae stars, of which 50,220 were not previously known to be variable, and for which 54,272 interstellar absorption estimates are available.

The PanSTARRS1 3π survey identified ~45,000 RR Lyrae stars, representing the widest (covering 3/4 of the sky) and deepest (reaching up to 120 kpc) sample of RR Lyrae stars to date. In 2017, Sesar et al. used these stars to develop a novel template-fitting technique, achieving highly accurate period estimates with precision better than 2 seconds in over 80% of cases.

The Dark Energy Survey (DES) was used to identify ~6000 RR Lyrae candidates in the southern sky , ~31% of which are previously undiscovered. The survey also improved period-luminosity relations, advancing distance measurements and studies of Galactic structure. 

Feng et al.] (2024) used the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey to identify 180 faint RR Lyrae candidates (~21 mag) at galactocentric distances of ~20–300 kpc, with ~100 not previously cataloged in PanSTARRS1 (PS1). The study applied empirical pulsation fitting techniques, originally developed for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), to analyze these candidates. 

RR Lyrae pulsational parameters from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) and the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey were validated and refined using the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey. Keck II&#x27;s ESI spectrograph was also used to analyze spectra of distant Milky Way halo RR Lyrae candidates to identify background quasar contaminants in previously mentioned surveys.

<doc id="309429" wikidata="Q951128" url="?curid=309429" title="Bodystocking">
<text>A bodystocking or body stocking is a one-piece skin-tight garment that covers the torso, legs and sometimes the arms of the wearer. It is a foundation garment or an article of lingerie usually made from a sheer fabric similar to that used for stockings or pantyhose, or from fishnet, lace or an opaque material, or a variation of these materials. A bodystocking differs from a unitard, which is worn as an outfit or article of clothing, and a leotard, which is used as a practice garment or performance costume for acrobats, gymnasts and other similar performers. Designed to be revealed, but not to be too revealing, bodystockings may be worn as undergarments by performers such as belly dancers and exotic dancers.

== Description ==

Oftentimes bodystockings are made of sheer fabric and are worn with or without undergarments such as a bra. Bodystockings normally come in only two sizes, especially when they use stretch material. A body stocking may be worn for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or a skirt. When worn as underwear, it is usually not worn with other underwear. It may be worn with panties for extra coverage or a bra for extra support. Sheer body stockings are too revealing to be worn alone.

Opaque bodystockings can be worn in place of tights and a blouse. Bodystockings also come in fishnet, lace and satin, the latter which may just consist of the top portion of the bodystocking, allowing it to be worn underneath a suit jacket to serve as a blouse. These types of bodystockings are also made sheer, enabling the wearer to wear a more revealing outfit coupled with sheer coverage for line smoothing.

Bodystockings are put on through the neck, in a similar technique to putting on a pair of tights: the body and arm sections are rolled down and then the legs are scrunched up like stockings; one would put one foot in and pull the stocking part up, and then the same on the other leg; from the waist, the bodystocking is pulled up over the torso to the chest, and then the arms are scrunched up and put on in same way as the legs; and the garment is then adjusted as required, and any ribbons and fasteners tied.

Due to its design, and its close-fitting and one-piece aspect, the wearer may have to remove the bodystocking for excretion, but crotchless bodystockings are also available. If a bodystocking is a foundation garment, any over clothing will also need to be removed.

== History ==

It is unclear when the first bodystocking was made or when it was first worn.

The first notable occasion was when American actress Adah Isaacs Menken wore one in 1861 in the play &quot;Mazeppa&quot;, based on Byron&#x27;s &quot;Mazeppa&quot;, in which she played a Ukrainian man who was tied nude to the back of a wild horse by his enemies. In the scene Menken wore a flesh coloured bodystocking to preserve her modesty while giving the illusion of nudity. The practice created controversy.

A body stocking was used in a tableau vivant style short film &quot;The Birth of the Pearl&quot; (1901), which featured an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-coloured body stocking in a direct frontal pose and provided a provocative view of the female body.

Other problematic roles which have sometimes been facilitated by wearing a flesh-coloured body-stocking are those of Eve in Biblical dramas and Lady Godiva in carnivals.

<text>Terrance Guido Gerin (born October 7, 1975) is an American professional wrestler better known by the ring name Rhyno or Rhino. He is signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he is a former TNA World Tag Team Champion, and 2024 TNA Hall of Fame inductee. He also performs on the independent circuit. He is best known for his tenures in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and WWE.

Gerin started his career in the Canadian independent circuit as Rhino Richards. He was signed by the American promotion ECW in 1999, where he shortened his name to Rhino. He remained with ECW until it closed in 2001, where he was the final World Heavyweight and World Television Champion. He then joined the World Wrestling Federation (later renamed WWE) with several other ECW wrestlers and was involved in the Invasion angle, in which ECW and WCW alumni joined forces against WWF wrestlers. He worked as Rhyno for WWE until 2005, when he signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and defeated Jeff Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He lost it two days later and remained with TNA until 2010.

In 2015, Rhyno returned to WWE. He initially worked in NXT, its developmental territory, and was promoted to the main roster in December. During his time on the SmackDown brand, he teamed with Heath Slater and won a tournament to become the inaugural SmackDown Tag Team Champions. He left WWE again in 2019 and returned to TNA.

== Early life ==
Gerin was born on October 7, 1975, in Detroit, Michigan. He is of Italian descent, with his ancestry being Venetian. He graduated from Annapolis High School in Dearborn Heights, Michigan where he was on the wrestling team. Gerin trained in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1995–1998) ===
Gerin trained as a wrestler at the Can-Am Wrestling School located in Windsor, Ontario under Scott D&#x27;Amore, with whom he later reunited in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He began training on September 24, 1994, and had his first match on March 10, 1995. Gerin made four appearances in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as enhancement talent under the ring name Terry Richards. Richards lost to &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan on the August 5, 1995, edition of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;. WCW Television Champion The Renegade defeated Richards on the September 9 edition of &quot;WCW Pro&quot;. Richards and Johnny Swinger lost to the Nasty Boys on the September 16 edition of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;. His final appearance was a loss to Road Warrior Hawk on the September 23, 1995, edition of &quot;WCW WorldWide.&quot;

In the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Gerin lost to Henry O. Godwinn on the November 6, 1995, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; (wrestling under the name &quot;Terry Richards&quot;). He was part of the losing team in a six-man tag team match against The Truth Commission at the June 23, 1997 &quot;WWF Shotgun Saturday Night&quot; taping (aired June 28). Gerin then adopted the ring name Rhino Richards and began wrestling in Canada, where he formed a stable known as &quot;THUG Life&quot; with Joe Legend, Zakk Wyld (Keith Assoun), Christian Cage, Bloody Bill Skullion, Brett Kimball, and Sexton Hardcastle (later named Edge). He wrestled a dark match at the June 29, 1998 &quot;WWF Shotgun Saturday Night&quot; taping, defeating Breyer Wellington.

=== Catch Wrestling Association (1997–1998) ===
In 1997, Gerin relocated to Hanover, Germany, where he began competing for the Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) under the ring name &quot;Rhino Richards&quot;. On October 10, 1998, he teamed with XL Legend to win the vacant CWA World Tag Team Championship, defeating Rico de Cuba and August Smisl. The titles were vacated in October 1998 when Gerin left the promotion after signing with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1999–2001)===
Gerin debuted in ECW on February 19, 1999, at a live event as &quot;Rhino Richards&quot;, teaming with Nova to defeat the Full Blooded Italians (Tracy Smothers and Little Guido). After working a few live events during his early months in the promotion, Gerin made his televised debut as a heel on the June 25 episode of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot; as &quot;Rhino&quot;, a comically aggressive, psychotic, and unstable powerhouse wrestler who reveled in extremely violent wrestling and ferocious brutality. He was introduced by Steve Corino and Jack Victory as Taz&#x27;s opponent in a match, which Rhino quickly lost.

Rhino made his first pay-per-view appearance at Heat Wave, where he aided Corino and their new ally Yoshihiro Tajiri during their matches. When ECW debuted on national television with a weekly show on TNN, the alliance of Rhino, Corino, Victory and Tajiri joined Cyrus to form a group called The Network. Cyrus represented TNN and was viewed as criticizing the hardcore wrestling style of ECW. Rhino&#x27;s first match at a pay-per-view took place at Anarchy Rulz, where Rhino and Corino unsuccessfully challenged Tommy Dreamer and Raven for the ECW World Tag Team Championship, but were defeated. On the October 1 episode of &quot;ECW on TNN&quot;, Rhino received his first opportunity for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship against Mike Awesome, which he failed to win. In late 1999, Rhino began feuding with The Sandman, and at November to Remember he teamed with the Impact Players to defeat Dreamer, Raven, and Sandman.

On January 29, 2000, Rhino competed against Rob Van Dam for the ECW World Television Championship. Van Dam retained the title but fractured his ankle which forced him to vacate the title. A tournament was set up to crown the new champion and Rhino participated in the tournament for the vacant title. He defeated Spike Dudley on the March 10 episode of &quot;ECW on TNN&quot; and advanced to the tournament final at Living Dangerously after The Sandman was eliminated by forfeit. Rhino faced Super Crazy in the finals of the tournament later that night, which headlined the show. Rhino lost after interference by RVD. However, Rhino won the World Television Championship on April 22 by defeating Yoshihiro Tajiri at CyberSlam, thus beginning his first title reign in ECW. Throughout mid-2000, Rhino continued to feud with The Sandman, defeating him in a title match at Hardcore Heaven. During that match, Rhino performed a &quot;Rhino Driver&quot; to the Sandman&#x27;s wife and valet, Lori. Rhino would then defend the title against Sandman, a second time at Heat Wave. Before the match, Rhino attacked the couple and attempted to force Lori&#x27;s head into a toilet. Rhino would go on to retain the title.

He lost the title to Kid Kash on August 26 at Midtown Massacre, but regained it a little over two weeks later on September 9. After winning his second World Television Championship, Rhino resumed his feud with Rob Van Dam, defeating him to retain the title at Anarchy Rulz. Rhino continued his title reign by successfully defending the title against New Jack at November to Remember and Spike Dudley at Massacre on 34th Street.

Rhino won the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on January 7, 2001, at Guilty as Charged, defeating Sandman in a squash match immediately after The Sandman had won the title from Steve Corino in a three-way tables, ladders, chairs, and canes match. He defended the title twice, defeating Sandman on January 12 and Spike Dudley on January 13, 2001, on the last two ECW shows and was the final World Heavyweight Champion and World Television Champion as the company folded in April.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2005) ===
==== Team RECK and The Alliance (2001−2002) ====

Following the closure of ECW, Gerin signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He debuted on the March 19, 2001, episode of &quot;WWF Raw is War&quot;, in Albany, New York at the Pepsi Arena, under the ring name Rhyno as a heel, aligning himself with Edge and Christian. Rhyno went on to help Edge and Christian defeat The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz for the WWF Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1. On the April 19 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Rhyno defeated Kane to win the WWF Hardcore Championship. At Backlash on April 29, he defeated Raven to retain the title. At Judgment Day on May 20, Rhyno, Edge, and Christian formed a stable with Kurt Angle known as Team RECK, with all four members reaching the semi-finals of the King of the Ring tournament. Rhyno was eliminated from the event by the eventual winner, Edge. He won the Hardcore Championship a total of three times in mid-2001.

On the July 9 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Rhyno &quot;invaded&quot; the WWF along with other ECW wrestlers. The group, led by former ECW owner Paul Heyman, went on to merge with rival organization WCW later that night, forming The Alliance. At Invasion on July 22, Rhyno competed in the main event the Inaugural Brawl match; five-on-five tag team match where Team WCW/ECW (Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, (WCW) Rhyno and the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) (ECW)) defeated Team WWF (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker and Kane). Rhyno feuded with Chris Jericho due to Jericho insulting Stephanie McMahon, the on-screen owner of ECW, on numerous occasions. One notable moment during the feud saw Rhyno &quot;Gore&quot; Jericho through the SmackDown! stage set on the August 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. This culminated in a match between the two at SummerSlam on August 19, in which Rhyno lost to Jericho. On September 23 at Unforgiven, he defeated fellow ECW alumnus Tajiri for the WCW United States Championship. He held the title for just under a month before losing to Kurt Angle on the October 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. As a result of his loss, Rhyno was &quot;suspended&quot; from The Alliance on the October 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The suspension was an angle concocted to explain Rhyno&#x27;s absence while he underwent cervical fusion surgery for two herniated discs in his neck. The surgery was successfully performed on November 12.

==== Various alliances (2003–2005) ====
Rhyno returned to WWE television sixteen months later on the February 27, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, aligning himself with Chris Benoit and turning into a face as they defeated Matt Hardy and Shannon Moore. He subsequently joined the SmackDown! brand. Rhyno and Benoit went on to unsuccessfully challenge Team Angle for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a triple threat tag team match also involving Los Guerreros at WrestleMania XIX on March 30. At Judgment Day on May 18, Rhyno teamed with Spanky and Chris Benoit to lose to John Cena and The Full Blooded Italians (Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli). After losing to Benoit in the opening round of the United States Championship tournament on the June 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Rhyno turned on Benoit during Benoit&#x27;s match against Eddie Guerrero for the United States Championship at Vengeance on July 27, thus turning heel once again. At SummerSlam on August 24, Rhyno competed in a fatal four-way match for the United States Championship against Guerrero, Benoit and Tajiri, but failed to win the title. Rhyno&#x27;s feud with Benoit was resolved in a singles match between the two on the September 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which Rhyno lost.

Rhyno made his first appearance in the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, by entering at #6 but was eliminated by the eventual winner Chris Benoit. On the February 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Rhyno got disqualified in a match against Hardcore Holly for shoving the referee. It led to a rematch between the two at No Way Out on February 15, which Rhyno lost. On the March 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Rhyno was drafted to the Raw brand in the 2004 WWE Draft Lottery. Later that night, he unsuccessfully faced Chris Benoit for the World Heavyweight Championship. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, he turned face once again by first squashing Lance Storm in a match and then forming a tag team with Tajiri. The duo defeated Jonathan Coachman and Garrison Cade in a tag team match at Vengeance on July 11. In the fall, Rhyno and Tajiri began pursuing the World Tag Team Championship and entered a feud with the champions La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway), unsuccessfully challenging them for the titles at Unforgiven on September 12. Rhyno and Tajiri received another title shot against La Résistance on the November 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a triple threat match, also involving William Regal and Eugene. Regal and Eugene won the titles.

On the January 10, 2005, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Rhyno lost a Royal Rumble qualifying match to Edge. Rhyno was released from his WWE contract on April 9, along with his friend Matt Hardy due to a public argument with his wife that took place at the WrestleMania 21 afterparty. He made his final appearance on WWE television at the WWE-produced ECW reunion pay-per-view One Night Stand on June 12, where he lost to Sabu.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2010) ===
==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (2005–2006) ====
After time on the independent circuit, Gerin made his debut in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on July 17, 2005 at No Surrender, as Rhino, reverting to the ECW spelling of his wrestling name. He debuted by hitting then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Raven with the Gore following a match with Abyss, thus debuting as both a heel and a member of Planet Jarrett.

These events led to a match being scheduled between the team of Rhino and Jeff Jarrett and the team of Raven and the returning Sabu at Sacrifice on August 14. During the Sacrifice preshow, Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko informed Jarrett, who had lobbied for a title shot for several weeks, that if he could pin Raven, he would receive a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Unbreakable on September 11. If Jarrett lost the match, he would be prohibited from receiving an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match for one year. Later that night, during the tag match, Jeff Hardy returned to TNA, attacking Jarrett and enabling Rhino to Gore and pin Raven. An irate Jarrett, furious at having lost his shot at the title, watched as Zbyszko announced Rhino to be the new number one contender immediately after the pay-per-view went off the air. Rhino faced Raven at Unbreakable in a match which saw him accidentally &quot;Gore&quot; a shopping cart in homage to his WWF Hardcore Championship bout with Raven at Backlash in the WWF. Despite interference from Jarrett, Raven retained his title after hitting Rhino with an &quot;Even Flow DDT&quot;.

Rhino fought Jeff Hardy in the main event of the debut episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; on Spike TV on October 1. The match was declared a no-contest after both Abyss and Sabu interfered. At Bound for Glory on October 23, Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Hardy faced each other in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match, which Rhino won after hitting a second rope &quot;Rhino Driver&quot; on Hardy. Later that night, Rhino won a 10-man Gauntlet match to determine who would face Jeff Jarrett for his NWA World Heavyweight Championship after Kevin Nash, Jarrett&#x27;s scheduled opponent, was rushed to the hospital due to a legitimate injury. Rhino went on to defeat Jarrett and win the title. Rhino lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship back to Jarrett on a 2-hour prime time special episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; on November 3.

Starting with the November 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, TNA started airing promos about Rhino&#x27;s career and personal life in preparation for his title rematch at Turning Point on December 11. He lost the rematch to Jarrett after a guitar shot and interference from all of Team Canada.

==== Various feuds (2006–2008) ====

In 2006, Rhino then wrapped up a brutal feud with Abyss, who (due to his alignment with Planet Jarrett) halted Rhino&#x27;s war on Team Canada. The feud saw Abyss &quot;Black Hole Slam&quot; Rhino on to several chairs, and Rhino smash Abyss through a steel wall with the &quot;Gore&quot;. Their singles feud ended at Against All Odds on February 12 when Rhino Gored Abyss off of a fifteen-foot ramp on to four tables. Rhino became a member of Sting&#x27;s four-man team of &quot;Warriors&quot;, joining A.J. Styles and Ron Killings to fight Jeff Jarrett&#x27;s &quot;Army&quot; in a Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown on April 23, which Rhino&#x27;s team won.

On June 9, after Rhino defeated Jeff Jarrett at a TNA house show in the old ECW Arena in Philadelphia, he publicly acknowledged that he had been offered a contract to come back to WWE and wrestle for the new ECW. He stayed with TNA. On July 11, Rhino made an open challenge against WWE for their current incarnation of ECW. The shocking revelation was that he did not like the direction of the new ECW and threw the &quot;real&quot; ECW World Heavyweight Championship (hidden in a burlap sack as Rhino stated WWE threatened legal action if he showed it) into an oil drum and burned it (he later admitted that it was a replica, and he still has the original belt at his home).

He then feuded with Monty Brown and Samoa Joe. This resulted in the three men competing at Hard Justice on August 13, which ended with Samoa Joe winning by pinning Monty Brown after slamming Brown through a table. Rhino then entered into a feud with Christian Cage, playing off their former history together in WWE, Japan, and Canada. The feud continued when Christian and Rhino faced off in an Eight Mile Street Fight at Bound for Glory on October 22. Christian won after a con-chair-to with a ladder, a broken table, a street sign, and some chairs on top of Rhino. This feud culminated on the November 16 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, where he faced Cage in a six-sides of steel barbed wire match. Cage won the match after Rhino&#x27;s &quot;Gore&quot; sent him through the door of the cage.

Near the end of 2006, Rhino entered into a program with A.J. Styles. This started with Rhino trying to help Styles with his situation with Christopher Daniels, only to have Styles pull away and accuse Rhino of getting into his business, thus turning him heel. Rhino lost to Styles at Turning Point on December 10 after Styles faked a knee injury and then pinned Rhino with a roll-up. At Final Resolution on January 14, 2007, Rhino defeated Styles in a Last Man Standing match. Rhino set up tables in anticipation of sending Styles through them with a Gore. Styles saw what was happening and declined to get up, thus losing. After the match, Rhino swore he was not through with Styles and gave him a Rhino Driver on the entrance ramp.

At Against All Odds on February 11, Styles defeated Rhino in a Motor City Chain match after dodging a Gore and rolling up Rhino for the pin. Styles then challenged any wrestler in TNA to wrestle him at Destination X on March 11 in the debut of the Elevation X match and Rhino accepted the challenge. At Destination X, Rhino defeated Styles in the Elevation X match after a Gore, and stomping on Styles&#x27; fingers. On March 22, Rhino was chosen as the third member of Kurt Angle&#x27;s team for the Lethal Lockdown match]] at Lockdown on April 15, along with Samoa Joe and eventually Jeff Jarrett and Sting. Team Angle was successful at Lockdown after defeating Christian&#x27;s Coalition in the Lethal Lockdown match. Rhino had a big spot in the match when he Gored Tomko through the cage door.
Rhino went through short feuds with Christopher Daniels and The Latin American Xchange before moving on to his next big feud with James Storm. On the June 21 &quot;Impact!&quot;, Storm and Robert Roode defeated Rhino and Eric Young. Following the match, Storm poured beer on Rhino, causing him to snap. Two weeks later, Rhino had a sit-down interview with Mike Tenay and revealed that he was a recovering alcoholic, and that caused him to snap after being covered with beer.

The feud between Rhino and Storm resulted in a match at Victory Road on July 15. Storm won the match after hitting Rhino with a beer bottle. After the match was over Storm and Jackie Moore attacked Rhino and poured beer into his mouth and left him bleeding in the ring. At Hard Justice on August 12, Rhino lost a Bar Room Brawl to Storm, after Storm smashed a beer bottle into the back of Rhino&#x27;s head, but Rhino beat him at No Surrender on September 9. After the match, he gored Moore. Rhino then feuded with Raven, resulting in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match at Bound for Glory on October 14 between Rhino, Raven, Abyss, and Black Reign which Abyss won.

At Turning Point on December 2, he was scheduled to participate in a match teaming with Abyss to take on Black Reign and Rellik, but he was replaced by Raven due to injury. After battling a kayfabe alcoholism relapse (brought on by the James Storm storyline), Rhino officially made his return at Against All Odds on February 10, 2008 when he Gored Storm, which caused Eric Young to retain his World Drinking Championship. On March 9, Rhino defeated Storm at Destination X, in the second official Elevation X Match, making Rhino 2-0 in Elevation X.

==== Alliance with Christian and TNA Front Line (2008–2009) ====
The next week, Christian Cage had to find a tag partner to help him fight A.J. Styles and Tomko and asked Rhino to join him, but Rhino refused due to their past history (Cage had since turned face). Tomko, Styles, and Team 3D attacked Cage after his tag team match with Kevin Nash. The following week on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Cage managed to get Rhino on his side during an interview with Jeremy Borash. At Lockdown on April 13 in the Lethal Lockdown match, Rhino pinned Storm to get the win for Cage&#x27;s team. Rhino went on to form a tag team with Cage and they competed in the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament to crown new tag team champions by beating The Motor City Machine Guns (Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley) to qualify. The tournament took place at Sacrifice on May 11 where they beat the team of Robert Roode and Booker T, but lost in the second round to Team 3D after Brother Ray hit Rhino with a kendo stick. Rhino beat James Storm to qualify for the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 8, where Samoa Joe retained the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Since then, Rhino formed a tag team with Christian Cage. At Hard Justice on August 10, Rhino and Christian Cage defeated Team 3D to end their feud.
Rhyno and Christian quietly went their separate ways, with Cage going to main events and Rhino along with then TNA Women&#x27;s Champion Taylor Wilde starting a feud with The Beautiful People and Cute Kip shortly after Hard Justice. At Bound for Glory IV on October 12, Rhino along with ODB and Rhaka Khan (who recently turned face) defeated The Beautiful People and Cute Kip in a Bimbo Brawl. On the October 23 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Rhino confronted Sheik Abdul Bashir over political views. He was later attacked by Bashir. The feud ended after Rhino got revenge and defeated Sheik at Turning Point on November 9.

On the November 20 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Rhino attacked The Main Event Mafia, but the Main Event Mafia fought back and placed him in a casket. The next week, Rhino officially joined A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe, naming the group the TNA Front Line. Rhino decided the Front Line had to have more members if they wanted to beat the Main Event Mafia, and, much to the surprise and questioning of the group, asked Team 3D to join the Front Line. Later in the night, Team 3D agreed to join the Front Line, helping Styles and Joe attack the Main Event Mafia. At Genesis on January 11, 2009, Rhino lost to Sting in a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match.

==== Heel turn (2009–2010) ====
At the Lockdown pre-show on April 19, Eric Young defeated Danny Bonaduce. After the bout, Bonaduce attacked Young, but Rhino came to the ring to aid Young and then gored Bonaduce. He then began an angle in which he trained Jesse Neal, a former member of the military, to become a pro wrestler. Rhino became frustrated and short-tempered. This led to a tag match on the August 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, which Neal lost after a rookie mistake, refusing a hot tag to Rhino. Rhino turned heel by goring his protege. His former mentors, Team 3D, realized what a selfish man Rhino was, thus leading to a feud between them.

Rhino appeared at No Surrender on September 20 to face new signee Bobby Lashley. Despite goring him twice, Rhino was defeated following a knockout punch. On the October 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, he lost a stretcher match to Bobby Lashley. The following week, Rhino claimed that TNA was favoring the younger talent of TNA, while trying to force veterans like himself out of TNA. After weeks of persuasion, on the November 5 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Team 3D turned heel and joined Rhino in his cause.

At Turning Point on November 15, Rhino along with Team 3D defeated Matt Morgan, Hernandez and D&#x27;Angelo Dinero after a &quot;Gore&quot; by Rhino. On the November 19 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Jesse Neal turned heel and joined Rhino and Team 3D. Two weeks later, Suicide joined Morgan, Hernandez and Dinero to level the playing field. At Final Resolution on December 20, Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. When Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff took over TNA at the beginning of 2010, Rhino&#x27;s angle was discontinued and Team 3D reverted to being faces and began feuding with The Nasty Boys.

==== EV 2.0 and departure (2010) ====

After being absent from television for four months, Rhino returned on the July 1 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, appearing in the Impact! Zone crowd beside fellow ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer, Raven and Stevie Richards, thus seemingly turning back into a face. On the July 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Rhino, Dreamer, Raven, Richards, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Al Snow, led by Mick Foley, aligned themselves with the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam by attacking Abyss and the rest of the TNA locker room. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay–per–view event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand on August 8, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to ECW. At Hardcore Justice, Rhino defeated Al Snow and Brother Runt in a three-way match.

On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni, known collectively as EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they did not deserve to be in TNA. During the assault Abyss came out, fought Rob Van Dam backstage and caused him storyline injuries, which forced him to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and led to EV 2.0 looking for revenge. On the August 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Rhino called out Abyss for what he had done and then laid him out with a Gore. At No Surrender on September 5, Abyss defeated Rhino in a Falls Count Anywhere match.

At Bound for Glory on October 10, Rhino, Dreamer, Raven, Richards and Sabu defeated members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match. Shortly after, his contract with TNA expired, but he remained with TNA on a per night deal. At Turning Point on November 7, EV 2.0 faced Fortune in a ten-man tag team match, where each member of EV 2.0 put their TNA careers on the line. In the end, EV 2.0 lost the match and Sabu was released from TNA. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Rhino revealed himself as the man within EV 2.0, who had been calling Eric Bischoff, trying to get to be a part of his Immortal stable, which had led to dissension between Rob Van Dam, who wanted to find out the traitor, and the rest of EV 2.0, by costing Van Dam his match against Kazarian and hitting Tommy Dreamer with a chair, turning heel again in the process.

On the November 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Rhino explained that Bischoff had agreed to re–sign him as long as he turned on the rest of EV 2.0. The following week Dreamer defeated Rhino in a Street Fight. After the match Rhino attacked Dreamer, but was then chased away by Rob Van Dam, who challenged him to a First Blood match at Final Resolution on December 5, which Van Dam ended up winning.

<text>Second Foundation is the third novel published of the &quot;Foundation&quot; Series by American writer Isaac Asimov, and the fifth in the in-universe chronology. It was first published in 1953 by Gnome Press.

&quot;Second Foundation&quot; consists of two previously published novellas originally published in &quot;Astounding Magazine&quot; (with different titles) between 1948 and 1950, making this the third volume in Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series. Decades later, Asimov wrote two further sequel novels and two prequels. Later writers have added authorized tales to the series. The &quot;Foundation&quot; series is often regarded as one of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s best works, along with his &quot;Robot&quot; series.

The term also describes the organization by that name which is the focus of the book. The organization&#x27;s existence (and nothing more) had been revealed in &quot;Foundation&quot;; it is searched for in &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot;, and it makes brief appearances in this novel. It would not be described in detail until &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Part I: Search by the Mule&quot; was originally published in the January 1948 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; under the title &quot;Now You See It...&quot;. &quot;Part II: Search by the Foundation&quot; was originally published in the November and December 1949 and January 1950 issues of &quot;Astounding&quot; under the title &quot;...And Now You Don&#x27;t&quot;.

The Second Foundation would again be revisited in &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

== Plot summary ==

=== &quot;Part I: Search by the Mule&quot; === 
Part I is about the Mule&#x27;s search for the elusive Second Foundation, with the intent of destroying it. The executive council of the Second Foundation is aware of The Mule&#x27;s intent and, in the words of the First Speaker, allows him to find it—&quot;in a sense&quot;. The Mule sends two of his people on a search for the Second Foundation: Han Pritcher, who had once been a captain and a member of the underground opposition prior to being Converted to the Mule&#x27;s service, and Bail Channis, an &quot;Unconverted&quot; man (one who hasn&#x27;t been emotionally manipulated by the Mule to join him) who has quickly risen through the ranks and impressed the Mule.

Channis reveals his suspicions about the Second Foundation being located on the planet Tazenda, and takes the ship there. They first land on Rossem, a barren planet controlled by Tazenda, and meet with its governor, who appears ordinary. Once they return to the ship, Pritcher confronts Channis and believes him to have been too successful with the search. The Mule, who had placed a hyper-relay on their ship in order to trace them through hyper-space, appears, and reveals that Channis is a Second Foundationer. Pritcher&#x27;s emotional bonds to the Mule are broken in the ensuing exchange between Channis and the Mule, and he is made to fall into deep sleep. With only the two of them left, the Mule reveals that he has brought his ships to Tazenda and has already destroyed the planet, and yet senses that Channis&#x27;s dismay is only pretense. He forces Channis to reveal that Rossem is actually the Second Foundation, and that Tazenda is only a figurehead.

The First Speaker for the Second Foundation appears and reveals to the Mule that his rule is over; neither Tazenda nor Rossem is the Second Foundation, and Channis&#x27;s knowledge had been falsely implanted to mislead the Mule. Second Foundation agents are headed to Kalgan and the Foundation worlds to undo the Conversions of the Mule, and his fleet is too far away to prevent it. When the Mule experiences a moment of despair, the First Speaker is able to seize control of and change his mind; he will return to Kalgan and live out the rest of his short life as a peaceful despot.

=== &quot;Part II: Search by the Foundation&quot; === 
Part II takes place 60 years after the first part, 55 years after the Mule&#x27;s death by natural causes. With the Mule gone his former empire falls apart and the Foundation resumes its independence. Because of their enslavement at the hands of the Mule and their wariness of the Second Foundation (who possess similar abilities to the Mule) the Foundation began studying the mental sciences.

A secret cabal is formed within the Foundation to root out the Second Foundation after evidence of the latter&#x27;s manipulation is found through mental analysis of the former society&#x27;s key figures. They send one of their own, Homir Munn, to Kalgan to search for clues to the Second Foundation&#x27;s location. Munn is followed to Kalgan by Arcadia, Dr Darell&#x27;s daughter.

Since the death of the Mule, the Second Foundation has worked to restore the Seldon Plan into its proper course. In the organization&#x27;s secret location, the First Speaker discusses the state of the galaxy with a student. The Student is concerned that the Foundation&#x27;s now tangible knowledge of the Second Foundation&#x27;s existence would have negative effects upon the former which would then further destabilize the Seldon Plan. The First Speaker reassures the Student that a plan has been put in place by their organization in order to address his very concerns.

In Kalgan, a man named Stettin has assumed the Mule&#x27;s former title as First Citizen. He believes that the Mule&#x27;s actions have made the Seldon Plan irrelevant and declares war upon the Foundation, intending to usurp their role in the formation of the Second Empire. He&#x27;s unconcerned with the possible intervention of the Second Foundation.

Arcadia escapes from Kalgan to Trantor with the help of a Trantorian trader named Preem Palver. With his help, she passes information to her father regarding the location of the Second Foundation.

Kalgan eventually loses the war against the Foundation as the specter of the Seldon Plan adversely affects the performance of the Kalganians every bit as much as it bolsters the morale of the Foundationers. 

The Foundation cabal reconvenes to discuss what they&#x27;ve learned about the Second Foundation. Munn believes that the Second Foundation never existed while Pelleas Anthor believes they&#x27;re in Kalgan. Dr Darell states that the Second Foundation is in Terminus itself based on information supplied by Arcadia. He also reveals he has created a device capable of emitting mind static, which is harmful to individuals with mental abilities similar to that of the Mule and the Second Foundation. Activating the device in the presence of the cabal reveals Anthor to be a Second Foundationer, and further interrogation leads to the discovery of the rest of his comrades who are subsequently detained indefinitely.

Unsatisfied with the ease by which the Second Foundation has been defeated and suspecting Arcadia&#x27;s information to be planted through mental tampering, Dr Darell runs tests on his daughter to determine if she has been compromised. Both are relieved when the tests&#x27; results are negative. Dr Darell basks in the realization that with the Second Foundation gone, the First Foundation is the sole inheritor of the Seldon Plan and the Second Empire.

However, the Second Foundation is not only intact but has planned and orchestrated the recent major events. The Foundation&#x27;s conflict with Kalgan and their subsequent victory was meant to restore the former&#x27;s self-esteem after the Mule enslaved them. Anthor and his comrades were in fact martyrs meant to mislead the Foundation into believing they had eliminated the Second Foundation, thereby shrouding the Second Foundation in secrecy once more and restoring the Seldon Plan to its proper course. Arcadia was unknowingly working for the Second Foundation, having been mentally adjusted shortly after her birth in order to prevent detection. The Second Foundation is actually located at the planet Trantor, the seat of the former Galactic Empire.

The story closes with the revelation that the First Speaker of the Second Foundation is Preem Palver, who is satisfied that the galaxy is now forever secure.

==Reception==
On its initial publication, Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin described &quot;Second Foundation&quot; as &quot;a thoroughly satisfying and adult play of the scientific imagination&quot;. P. Schuyler Miller reported &quot;Second Foundation&quot; to be &quot;good, sound, middle-of-the-road science fiction with a carefully hidden surprise&quot;.

==The organization==
The Second Foundation was founded by Hari Seldon as a budding colony of psychologists and mentalics, people with telepathic abilities, located &quot;at Star&#x27;s End&quot;, an intentionally obscure term used by Seldon. In &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;, the original Second Foundation is revealed to also include Hari&#x27;s own granddaughter, Wanda Seldon, and his bodyguard Stettin Palver.

The establishment, location and development of this Foundation was a secret, &quot;drowned in silence&quot; to increase its effectiveness and security.

Whilst the First Foundation was strong in the physical sciences, the Second Foundation was strong in the mental sciences, including the continued development of psychohistory. Their function is to ensure that the Seldon plan comes to pass, both by refining the plan&#x27;s contingencies to allow for even the most unlikely events, and to guard against unexpected developments, such as the Mule. Their eventual goal is to become the ruling class of the Second Empire in an effort to introduce mental sciences to humanity (whose benefits are, according to one Second Foundationer, less apparent, but longer lasting than physical sciences), while the First Foundation they manipulate forms the necessary political union.

The Second Foundation are governed by a council of the strongest mentalics, called the Speakers. However, the name &quot;Speaker&quot; is a misnomer, because, being telepaths, the use of actual speech is quite unnecessary. The leader of the group is the First Speaker. The only formal power of the First Speaker was to speak first at meetings of the Speaker&#x27;s Table, but in practice it conferred significantly more power.

The structure of the Foundation is akin to both an intelligence network and a university. A complex of buildings on Trantor, the remnants of those saved from The Great Sack and those not demolished to provide metal for export, house a staff of technicians and analysts. Into these buildings flow reports from agents located in many parts of the Galaxy; these reports form the basis of any action that may be taken in furthering the aim of the Seldon Plan.

The Second Foundation spreads a net over the galaxy to detect and recruit staff and agents. These are then specially trained over many years. Some become statistical technicians, but the best of the trainees are invited to commence an apprenticeship for Speakerhood.

<text>The nobility of China represented the upper strata of aristocracy in premodern China, acting as the ruling class until 1000 , and remaining a significant feature of the traditional social structure until the end of the imperial period.

The concepts of hereditary sovereignty, peerage titles, and noble families existed as early as the semi-mythical and early historical periods, but the systems of enfeoffment and establishment only developed in the Zhou dynasty, by the end of which a clear delineation of ranks had emerged. This process was a function of the interface between the ancient patriarchal clan system, an increasingly sophisticated apparatus of state, and an evolving geopolitical situation. 

In the subsequent millennia, this system retained its essential character, albeit with modifications in titles and their relative rankings, and fluctuating power dynamics between the great families, the imperial house, the ministerial and mercantile classes, and other stakeholders in the political economy of the times. After the Song dynasty, most bureaucratic offices were filled through the imperial examination system, undermining the power of the hereditary aristocracy. Historians have noted the disappearance by 1000 of the powerful clans that had dominated China. 

The last, well-developed system of noble titles was established under the final imperial dynasty, the Qing. The Republican Revolution of 1911 ended the official imperial system. Though some noble families maintained their titles and prestige for a time, new political and economic circumstances forced their decline. Today, this class has virtually disappeared.

==Sovereign and ruling family ranks==
The apex of the nobility is the sovereign. The title of the sovereign has changed over time, together with the connotations of the respective titles. Three levels of sovereignty could be distinguished: supreme rule over the realm, relatively autonomous local sovereignty, and tributary vassalage. The supreme sovereign is the only office translated into English as the term &quot;emperor&quot;. An emperor might appoint, confirm, or tolerate sub-sovereigns or tributary rulers styled kings.

As a title of nobility, &quot;Ba Wang&quot;, hegemon, denoted overlordship of several subordinate kings while refraining from claiming the title of emperor. Sovereigns holding the title of king of an individual state within and without the shifting borders of the Chinese political realm might be fully independent heads of foreign states, such as the King of Korea. In some cases, they could be subordinate to foreign emperors just as territorial or tribal sovereign Mongol khans might be subject to one of several Khagans or Great khans. 

Some Chinese emperors styled many or all close male relatives of certain kinds such as &quot;wang&quot;, a term for king or prince, although the sovereignty of such relatives was limited. Local tribal chiefs could also be termed &quot;king&quot; of a particular territory ranging from vast to tiny, using convenient terms of the form &quot;(locality)&quot; + &quot;king&quot; such as Changshawang, &quot;King of Changsha&quot;. Changsha was briefly recognized as a kingdom, but was usually a political subunit. &quot;Barbarian&quot; leaders could also be referred to by names such as Yiwang, &quot;king of the Eastern Yi&quot;, while in other cases terms such as &quot;tusi&quot; (, &quot;native chief&quot;) might be used for the same office.

Family members of individual sovereigns were also born to titles – or granted them – largely according to family tree proximity. This included blood relatives and affinal relatives. Frequently, the parents of a founding dynast would be posthumously elevated to honorary sovereignty.

Titles translated in English as &quot;prince&quot; and &quot;princess&quot; were generally immediate or recent descendants of sovereigns, with increasing distance at birth from an ancestral sovereign in succeeding generations resulting in degradations of the particular grade of prince or princess, eventually to nullity. Rulers of smaller states were typically styled with lesser titles of aristocracy, which could be upgraded or downgraded with or without royal assent. Sometimes such an alteration in grade reflected real power dynamics; in other cases it was merely an act of public relations.

===Imperial house===

==== Emperor ====

Also known as &quot;Tianzi&quot;, &quot;The Son of Heaven&quot; the Chinese emperor wielded varying degrees of power between different emperors and different dynasties, with some emperors being absolute rulers and others being figureheads with actual power in the hands of court factions, eunuchs, the bureaucracy or noble families.

* In the mythical age, the sovereign was titled either &quot;huang&quot; (, initially an appellation for deceased ancestors) or &quot;di&quot; (, a deity of the Shang dynasty). These mythical rulers were called the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. For the lists of the earliest, mythological rulers, both titles are conventionally translated in English as &quot;Sovereigns&quot;, though translation as &quot;Emperor&quot; is also seen, which continues backwards in time the concept of an enduring political unity.
* The sovereigns during the Xia dynasty and Shang dynasty called themselves Di (Chinese: 帝 dì); titles of these rulers are generally translated as &quot;king&quot; and rarely as &quot;emperor&quot;.
* The sovereigns during the Zhou dynasty called themselves Wang (). before the Qin dynasty innovated the new term huangdi which would become the new standard term for &quot;emperor.&quot; The title &quot;Wang&quot; should not be confused with the common surname, which, at least by middle and later Chinese historical usage, has no definite royal implications. Rulers of these dynasties are conventionally translated with the title &quot;king&quot; and sometimes &quot;emperor&quot; in English.
* Emperor or Huangdi () was the title of the Chinese head of state of China from its invention by the Qin dynasty in 221 until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911. The first emperor of Qin combined the two words &quot;huang&quot; and &quot;di&quot; to form the new, grander title. Since the Han dynasty, &quot;Huangdi&quot; began to be abbreviated to &quot;huang&quot; or &quot;di&quot;. Many other unrelated appellations saw broad use.

The title of emperor was usually transmitted from father to son. Most often, the first-born son of the primary wife inherited the office, failing which the post was taken up by the first-born son of a concubine or consort of lower rank, but this rule was not universal and disputed succession was the cause of a number of civil wars. The emperor&#x27;s regime in the political theory of Heaven&#x27;s mandate allowed for a change in dynasty, and an emperor could be replaced by a rebel leader. The overthrow of an imperial house was sufficient evidence of the loss of the Mandate.

==== Imperial spouses and consorts ====

It was generally not accepted for a female to succeed to the throne as a sovereign regnant in her own right, rather than playing the role of a sovereign&#x27;s consort or regent for a sovereign during his age of minority. Official Chinese histories list only one reigning empress, Empress Wu of Tang. However, there have been numerous cases in Chinese history where a woman was the actual power behind the imperial throne.

&quot;Hou&quot; (: Empress, Queen, Empress Consort) was a title granted to an official primary spouse of the polygynous male Chinese Emperor. It was also used for the mother of the Emperor, typically elevated to the rank of Empress Dowager (: &quot;Tai Hou&quot;, &quot;Grand Empress&quot;) regardless of which spousal ranking she bore prior to the emperor&#x27;s accession. In practice, many Chinese Empresses Dowager wielded great power— either as official regent for a young sovereign or with the influence of position within family social ranks. From Empress Lü of Han ( 195 – 180) to Empress Dowager Cixi of Qing ( 1861–1908), some women unquestionably reigned supreme.

Imperial Consorts, ranking below Empress, aren&#x27;t often distinguished in English from imperial Concubines, the next lower rank, but these were also titles of significance within the imperial household.

The &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; states that Emperors are entitled to the following simultaneous spouses:
* 1 Empress (皇后)
* 3 Madames or Consorts (夫人)
* 9 Imperial Concubines (嬪)
* 27 Shifus (世婦)
* 81 Imperial Wives (御妻)

===Hegemons===

Sovereigns styled &quot;Ba&quot; or &quot;Bawang&quot; (, hegemon-protector), asserted official overlordship of several subordinate rulers while refraining from claiming the royal title. This practice began in the Spring and Autumn period, spurred by a royal house too militarily weak to defend its own lands, in combination with an aristocracy flexing its power in novel ways. A later example of this title is Xiang Yu (d. 202 ), who styled himself Xīchǔ Bàwáng, Hegemon of Chu.

==Two crownings and three respects==
It was a custom in China for the new dynasty to ennoble and enfeoff a member of the dynasty which they overthrew, so that they could maintain sacrifices to their ancestors. This practice was referred to as &quot;the two crownings and three respects.&quot; ()

===Ancient China===
It is said that when the purported Xia dynasty was overthrown by the Shang dynasty, Xia descendants were given a title and fiefs by the Shang King in Qi () and Zeng.

When the Shang dynasty was overthrown by the Zhou dynasty, the Zhou King granted a Shang royal scion the title &quot;Gong&quot; and fief of Song.

===Era of disunity===
In 220 , Emperor Xian of Han abdicated his throne to Cao Pi, who granted the previous emperor the title Duke of Shanyang (山陽公). His line persisted until 309.

The Emperors of Shu Han came from a cadet branch of the Han dynasty. When Cao Wei defeated the Shu Han Emperor Liu Shan, he and his family were granted noble titles under the new regime.

When the Eastern Wu was defeated by the Western Jin dynasty, the Jin Emperor granted the Eastern Wu Emperor Sun Hao the title of &quot;Marquis of Guiming&quot;. Sun Hao&#x27;s sons were made junior officials in the Jin government.

A number of outgoing emperors during the kaleidoscopic Six Dynasties period were enfeoffed by their overthrowers and subsequently killed anyway. This specific vicissitude was shared by Emperor Gong of Jin, Emperor Shun of Liu Song, Emperor He of Southern Qi, and Emperor Jing of Liang, representing consecutive dynasties between 421 and 558. The child emperor Gao Heng of the Northern Qi dynasty experienced a similar narrative arc two decades later.

=== Later developments ===
This practice continued all the way through the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, when the Republic of China allowed the last Qing Emperor to stay in the Forbidden City and keep his title, treating him as a foreign monarch until 1924. The descendants of Confucius were maintained in the title of Duke Yansheng until 1935 when the title was changed to Sacrificial Official to Confucius (大成至聖先師奉祀官), which remains as a position to this day, currently held by Kung Tsui-chang.

==Pre-imperial aristocracy==
The Zhou dynasty not only preceded the full unification of early China under the Qin dynasty, the first empire whose realm would subsequently be considered to extend broadly enough to be national in the context of the territorial concept of China, the Zhouli, Rites of Zhou were subsequently canonized by Confucius among his Confucian Chinese classics as a model precedent in principles of government, so ranks of nobility in later regimes both in periods of unified sovereignty and of competing smaller states would typically draw from its catalog of peerage. From Zhouli, later Confucian political philosophy and government publications, and from the surrounding historical literature of particular individuals, localities and events, the following social classifications have been attested.

===Honors and awards, and clan law, of the Zhou dynasty===
The social system of the Zhou dynasty is sometimes referred to as the Chinese feudalism and was the combination of &quot;fengjian&quot; (enfeoffment and establishment) and &quot;zongfa&quot; (clan law). Male subjects were classified into, in descending order of rank:

*the landed nobles – &quot;Zhuhou&quot; (諸侯 pinyin zhū hóu),
*the ministers (of the royal court) – &quot;Qing&quot; (卿 qīng),
*the bureaucrats – &quot;Dafu&quot; (大夫 dà fū)
*the yeomen – &quot;Shi&quot; (士 shì)
*the commoners – &quot;Shumin&quot; (庶民 shù mín).

&quot;Zongfa&quot; (宗法, clan law), which applied to all social classes, governed the primogeniture of rank and succession of other siblings. The eldest son of the consort would inherit the title and retained the same rank within the system. Other sons from the consort, concubines and mistresses would be given titles one rank lower than their father.

As time went by, all terms had lost their original meanings nonetheless. &quot;Qing&quot; (卿), &quot;Daifu&quot; (大夫) and &quot;Shi&quot; (士) became synonyms of court officials.

===Peer ranks of the Zhou dynasty===
====Western Zhou====
In the Western Zhou period, ranks were not systematized. There were titles that indicated political authority as well as those concerned with seniority in the ancestral temple. These were not mutually exclusive, and the names of some ranks could also be used as generic terms of respect to varying degrees in different circumstances. The most common titles were as follows:

* Gong (): Lord, Excellency, Patriarch. A term of highest respect, certain rulers (typically senior in the ancestral temple to the royal house), a term of address for any ruler within their own state, any ancestor within their own ancestral shrine, the highest government ministers.
* Hou (): Lord, Regional lord. Solely political term for certain rulers of specific ancient Chinese states.
* Bo (): Elder, Chief. A birth order term of seniority within the aristocracy indicating the most senior male member of a sublineage along the primary (patrilineal) line of descent.
* Zi (): master, unratified lord, ruler, sir. A term with many meanings, most not listed here, &quot;zi&quot; could be used as a term of respect for anybody, could indicate the son of an extremely high-ranking aristocrat or minister, or could be used as a title for any ruler who did not accept the authority of the Zhou royal house over them.
* Nan (). Rarely seen title applied to the rulers of two particular states.

====Eastern Zhou====
As central authority crumbled, the aristocracy found itself needing to signal who had more land, power, and resources. During this time the titles they had been using started to take on a more systematized structure. After a few hundred years, political thinkers saw this emergent structure and projected it idealistically and anachronistically backwards into a past where it had not actually held. This was called &quot;Wǔděngjuéwèi&quot; (), five (aristocratic) peerage ranks (abbreviated &quot;Wǔjué&quot;) below the royal ranks. This idealized structure was later implemented as policy during the early imperial period. Much later English translators attempted to map European-style feudal titles onto these.

====Male aristocracy====
* Gong (: &quot;duke&quot;, &quot;lord&quot;), held by some of the oldest lineages, still a term of highest respect in the Eastern Zhou, but with a more political character than the old sense of aristocratic honour. 
* Hou (: &quot;marquess&quot;, &quot;marquis&quot;, &quot;margrave&quot;), usually with the same emphasis on being a national borderland march lord as indicated by the element &quot;mar-&quot; present in its roughly analogous translations. These lineages, granted some of the largest and most promising peerages at the beginning of the Western Zhou, tended to possess the most political resources, despite being technically second rank.
* Bo (: &quot;earl&quot;, &quot;count&quot;). This birth order term (meaning &quot;eldest&quot;) came to carry a fully independent political meaning. 
* Zi (: &quot;viscount&quot;, &quot;master&quot;, &quot;unratified lord&quot;). Still a term pregnant with multiple meanings, by the late Eastern Zhou this title had found a place in the new graded hierarchy.
* Nan (: &quot;burgrave&quot;, &quot;baron&quot;). Title held by precisely two lineages.

====Female aristocracy====

Titles of female members of the aristocracies varied in different dynasties and eras, each having unique classifications for the spouses of the emperor. Any female member excluding a spouse of an emperor can be called a princess or &quot;gōngzhǔ&quot; (公主), and incorporated her associated place into her title if she had one.

====Other titles and honorifics====
Besides the systematized ranks listed above, there were also other familial appellations used as titles, e.g. &quot;Bo&quot; (伯; such as Bo Qin of Lu, later, its usage changed to titles for hegemony and countship), &quot;Zhong&quot; (仲; such as , younger brother of King Wen of Zhou), &quot;Shu&quot; (叔; such as several younger brothers of King Wu of Zhou, Guanshu Xian, Wei Kangshu, etc.), and &quot;Ji&quot; (季; such as ), birth order terms meaning &quot;eldest,&quot; &quot;second eldest,&quot; &quot;third eldest,&quot; and &quot;youngest&quot; (&quot;Shu&quot; was later used by extension to denote a father&#x27;s younger brother); and &quot;Jiu&quot; (舅, maternal uncle). 

Sons of kings who did not receive other titles were generically called &quot;Wangzi&quot; (王子, king&#x27;s son), and their children &quot;Wangsun&quot; (王孫, royal scion). Similarly, sons and grandsons of dukes and lords were called &quot;Gongzi&quot; (公子, duke&#x27;s son) and &quot;Gongsun&quot; (公孫, noble descendant).

These honorifics occasionally became heritable titles, no longer indicating relation with the reigning king. Some clans even took them as lineage names. &quot;Gongzi&quot; eventually evolved into the generic honorific for all young gentry. Today it is either used as a flattering way to address an interlocutor&#x27;s son, or a pejorative term for a wealthy man. &quot;Wangzi&quot;, on the other hand, is used today as the generic translation for the sons of a foreign monarch.

===Chu nobility===

The southern state of Chu had a notably distinct culture from the central plain states, including the nobility system. The royal ancestral temple kinship group surnamed Xiong and its branch lineages of Qu, Jing, and Zhao formed the main nobility of Chu. Within the elite, Chu&#x27;s early period mirrored that of Predynastic Zhou, the aristocratic ancestral temples and clan lineages sufficing to determine social position, without an additional expressly political dimension. Chu&#x27;s formal system of rank appeared around the late Spring and Autumn period, similar to the remainder of the Zhou confederation, but with different titles such as &quot;Tonghou&quot; (通侯, marquis-peer), &quot;Zhigui&quot; (執珪, jade scepter bearer), &quot;Zhibo&quot; (執帛, silk bearer). Their political offices also differed in name even where scope of responsibilities did not. Noble ranks, bestowed primarily as reward for military and civil service, and not in principle heritable, came with a state stipend. Holders of the highest ranks also received fiefs and the honorific title &quot;Jun&quot; (君, lord), such as Lord Chunshen.

The full systematization of ranks pioneered by the Qin dynasty took a bit longer to overcome Chu&#x27;s distinct culture, such that the Han founder Liu Bang, being of Chu origin, also awarded distinctly Chu titles.

==After the Zhou dynasty==


==Other historical Chinese titles==

Other titles might be tailored down to a single individual being officially honored for a particular achievement, with or without executive portfolio following the granting of the title, and might truly be titles outside the executive government structure, even when words used in their phrasing would otherwise imply executive office, e.g.,

&quot;Protector General&quot; (都護; Duhu) – for example, Ban Chao.

On the other hand, victorious generals were often granted official praise-names or names implying particular old and new duties or some combination of these, which would be quasi-executive or fully executive titles honored as much like peerage as like actual military rank, as in the case of Liu Bei promoting Guan Yu to a rank phrased as General Who Exterminates Bandits (蕩寇將軍) during the active course of Guan Yu&#x27;s military career.

In Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), the Dutch authorities appointed Chinese officers to the colonial administration to oversee the governance of the colony&#x27;s Chinese subjects. These officials bore the ranks of &quot;Majoor&quot;, &quot;Kapitein&quot; or &quot;Luitenant der Chinezen&quot;, and had extensive political and legal jurisdiction over the local Chinese community. Their descendants bore the hereditary title of &quot;Sia&quot;, and constituted the &quot;Cabang Atas&quot; or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia.

<doc id="309442" wikidata="Q5283398" url="?curid=309442" title="District of Columbia's at-large congressional district">
<text>The District of Columbia&#x27;s at-large congressional district is a congressional district encompassing all of Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States. Article One of the United States Constitution instructs that only &quot;States&quot; may be represented in the United States Congress. Because the District of Columbia does not meet that criterion, the member elected from the at-large district is not permitted to participate in votes on the floor of the House. Instead, constituents of the seat elect a non-voting delegate to the chamber. Though the delegate lacks full voting privileges, they are permitted to sit on, cast votes in, and chair congressional committees and subcommittees. The delegate may also join party caucuses, introduce legislation, and hire staff to assist with constituent services.

The modern office of delegate from the District of Columbia was established in 1971. Since then, it has been represented by just two individuals, both of them African American Democrats. Its current delegate is Eleanor Holmes Norton, an advocate for D.C. statehood who assumed office in 1991. Accordingly, she has held the seat for more than 60% of its existence.

==History of the office==
The office of delegate from the District of Columbia was initially established by Radical Republicans during the Reconstruction era. From 1871 to 1875, it was held by Norton P. Chipman, a Republican who had been appointed the first secretary of the District of Columbia by President Ulysses S. Grant. The position was abolished in 1875 and remained nonexistent for 96 years.

During the mid-20th century, there was a renewed push to extend greater voting rights to residents of Washington, D.C. By 1961, the necessary 37 states had successfully ratified the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution, which extended the District of Columbia the right to vote in presidential elections. Still, there remained bipartisan agreement that the District of Columbia – which in 1970 had more residents than 10 individual states — deserved at least some representation in the U.S. Congress.

Federal legislation to recreate a congressional delegate position for D.C. was first seriously debated by Congress in 1970. President Richard Nixon had repeatedly expressed his support for full voting representation for the District of Columbia. An initial proposal by Rep. Earle Cabell (D–TX) suggested creating two non-voting delegate positions for D.C.: one for the House and one for the Senate. Concerns that the Senate would stall such a proposal spurred the consideration of a compromise bill introduced by Rep. Ancher Nelsen (R–MN), who at the time served as ranking member of the House Committee on the District of Columbia. Nelsen&#x27;s proposal guaranteed non-voting representation only in the House.

In a written message to House Minority Leader Gerald Ford on August 6, 1970, Nixon reaffirmed that &quot;voting representation for the District of Columbia is my goal&quot; and strongly urged Ford to press for the bill&#x27;s passage. Ford and House Majority Leader Carl Albert both crafted messages to their respective caucuses in response, encouraging their members to support the measure. During closing arguments on the House floor, two representatives made particularly passionate pleas on the capital city&#x27;s behalf. The first came from Rep. John Conyers (D–MI), who decried the &quot;rank hypocrisy&quot; of denying &quot;a voice in our Government to the people who live closest to it.&quot; The second came from Rep. Michael J. Harrington (D–MA), who noted the lack of attention shown by the Congress to Washington: 

Opposition to the legislation was largely spearheaded by Rep. John L. McMillan (D–SC), the segregationist chairman of the House Committee on the District of Columbia. As chairman, McMillan repeatedly opposed home rule and greater rights for residents of D.C., largely because of its sizable Black population. The bill ultimately passed the House with 302 votes in favor and 57 votes against. The &quot;nay&quot; votes came predominately from Southerners. On September 9, 1970, the legislation passed the Senate. President Nixon, who called the District&#x27;s lack of voting rights &quot;one of the truly unacceptable facts of American life,&quot; signed the District of Columbia Delegate Act 13 days later.

The first election for the seat was held on March 23, 1971. Democrat Walter Fauntroy won the race and went on to serve in the Congress for nearly 20 years. A week after being sworn in, Fauntroy became one of the 13 founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus.

A further effort to grant the District of Columbia full voting rights in Congress via a constitutional amendment came in 1978. The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment passed both chambers of Congress, but it failed to receive the necessary number of state ratifications by its 1985 deadline. Reflecting increased political polarization, efforts to secure D.C. further voting rights since have largely failed along party lines.

Since 1993, when the House of Representatives has been under Democratic control, delegates, including the District of Columbia&#x27;s delegate, have been allowed to cast non-binding floor votes when the House of Representatives was operating in the Committee of the Whole.

The district has been represented by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton since 1991.

<doc id="309449" wikidata="Q1744498" url="?curid=309449" title="Klasky Csupo">
<text>Klasky-Csupo, Inc. ( ) is an American animation studio located in Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 1982 by producer Arlene Klasky and her then-husband, Hungarian animator Gábor Csupó (hence the company&#x27;s name) in a spare room of their apartment and grew to 550 artists, creative workers and staff in an animation facility in Hollywood.

During the 1990s and 2000s, they produced and animated era-defining shows for the children&#x27;s network, Nickelodeon, such as &quot;Rugrats&quot; (which was one of the channel&#x27;s original animated series, known as Nicktoons), &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, &quot;Rocket Power&quot;, &quot;As Told by Ginger&quot;, &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, and the U.S. dub of &quot;Poppy Cat&quot;. They also animated the first three seasons of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for 20th Century Fox Television and Gracie Films, as well as &quot;Duckman&quot; on USA Network. In 2008, Nickelodeon ended their long-running partnership with Klasky Csupo and its shows ceased production, resulting in the company becoming discontinued for four years. In 2012, the company reopened. In 2018, it began production on a CGI-animated reboot of &quot;Rugrats&quot;, which premiered in 2021 on Paramount+, the streaming service of Nickelodeon and its parent company Paramount Global.

== History ==

=== Early years (1982–1991) ===
Klasky-Csupo, Inc., got its start in 1982. It was founded in the spare bedroom of a Hollywood apartment where Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó were living during their marriage. 1 year later, Klasky-Csupo expanded and moved to a new location at 729 Seward Street,&lt;ref name=&quot;hqdevelopment/729-Seward&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (Bob Clampett″s studio) opening its first facility in Hollywood.

Klasky Csupo was initially distinguished by its work on logo designs, commercials, feature film trailers, TV show titles, promos and ident spots for a wide variety of clients, in the process earning a reputation as the industry&#x27;s most imaginative and innovative studio. Building on its success, the studio left Seward Street to open its second facility in Hollywood in 1988 at the corner of Fountain and Highland Avenues. The studio soon grew to include six buildings that have become well known in Hollywood—in true Klasky Csupo style, the exterior walls of the buildings are decorated with large murals of its characters.

The studio&#x27;s first big break came in 1987 when James L. Brooks of Gracie Films commissioned the studio to produce the title sequence for a comedy series titled &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. In addition to the main title, Klasky Csupo was given the opportunity to produce and animate a new series of one-minute cartoons which featured a family called the Simpsons, created by Matt Groening. Klasky Csupo produced and animated all 48 shorts, and when it became one of the most popular segments on the show, Fox began airing a weekly half-hour series entitled &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Klasky Csupo oversaw and animated every episode of the first three seasons of the series, resulting in the studio sharing the 1989–1990 and 1990–1991 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, with Gracie Films.

In addition, Klasky Csupo produced the hit video &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;. Klasky Csupo animator and colorist &quot;Georgie&quot; Gyorgyi Kovacs Peluce (Kovács Györgyike)&lt;ref name=&quot;mubi/hungarian-animation&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy/27351850&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=jcJMPiM0tCwC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=diKnDBs0wrIC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;intanibase/11803&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smithsonianmag/180962482&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; conceived the idea of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; characters having yellow skin, and Marge Simpson having blue hair, opting for something which &quot;didn&#x27;t look like &quot;anything&quot; that had come before.&quot; Klasky Csupo was also responsible for an error during the episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, in which Waylon Smithers was colorized as black with blue hair.

In 1992, Gracie Films switched domestic production of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to Film Roman, which continued until 2016. Csupó was &quot;asked [by Gracie Films] if they could bring in their own producer [to oversee the animation production],&quot; but declined, stating &quot;they wanted to tell me how to run my business.&quot; Sharon Bernstein of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Gracie executives had been unhappy with the producer Csupo had assigned to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and said the company also hoped to obtain better wages and working conditions for animators at Film Roman.&quot; Of the 110 people he employed to animate &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Csupó laid off 75.

=== Success with animated series (1991–2005) ===
In 1991, Klasky Csupo created &quot;Rugrats&quot;, one of the first animated shows for Nickelodeon - known as &quot;Nicktoons&quot; - which was inspired by the couple&#x27;s two sons and the idea of what they would do if they could speak. Their next major series was &quot;Duckman&quot; for the USA Network, which revolved around the home life and adventures of a dim-witted and lascivious private detective duck named Eric Duckman. The series ran from 1994 to 1997. During the same time, Nickelodeon released Klasky Csupo&#x27;s second Nicktoon series, &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;. During this time, Klasky Csupo originally ended production on &quot;Rugrats&quot; due to the network&#x27;s since-outdated 65-episode rule. However, when &quot;Rugrats&quot; went into syndication, it exploded in popularity with ratings skyrocketing and advertising deals taking off, prompting Nickelodeon and Klasky Csupo to resume production on the series. The show was cited as &quot;a show like &quot;the Simpsons&quot;, but for children&quot;.

In 1993, Klasky Csupo worked with comedian Lily Tomlin and her partner Jane Wagner to bring the irascible little girl, Edith Ann, to television in two half-hour animated specials for ABC. The first, &quot;A Few Pieces of the Puzzle&quot;, aired in January 1994 and received critical acclaim, and the second, &quot;Homeless Go Home&quot;, aired in May 1994 to even better response and ratings.

In 1995, the studio debuted &quot;Santo Bugito&quot;, the first Saturday morning animated comedy on television. Created by Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo for CBS, &quot;Santo Bugito&quot; tells the story of a small town of 64 million insects located on the border of Texas and Mexico. Music-driven and Latin-influenced, the series stars Cheech Marin, Joan Van Ark, Tony Plana, William Sanderson, George Kennedy, Marabina Jaimes, and David Paymer, and is highlighted by a distinctive look and the music of Mark Mothersbaugh, the &quot;Devo&quot; keyboardist who also composed the music of &quot;Rugrats&quot;.

The same year, Klasky Csupo established Klasky Csupo Commercials (rebranded as Class-Key Chew-Po Commercials in 1998), helmed by John Andrews, in order to continue the successful commercial animation business that had grown from the company&#x27;s initial work in main titles and graphics. Class-Key Chew-Po had been an immediate success, building an impressive client list with work for companies like 1-800-COLLECT, Oscar Mayer, Taco Bell, Kraft, and Nickelodeon. In 2001, the company founded Ka-Chew!, a live-action commercial division.

The company was also active in producing recorded music with the record labels Tone Casualties and Casual Tonalities. Gabor Csupo was a good friend of Frank Zappa and occasionally collaborates with Mark Mothersbaugh. After &quot;Duckman&quot; and &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;&#x27; were both cancelled in 1997, Klasky Csupo began producing &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; for Nickelodeon, which premiered the following year; the story revolved around a girl named Eliza Thornberry who could talk to animals.

In 1998, Klasky Csupo produced its first feature-length film, &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, which opened in the United States on November 20, 1998 as the #1 film in the country and grossed $141 million worldwide, becoming the first non-Disney animated film to gross over $100 million in the United States. It was then followed by two sequels, &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot; (2000) and &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; (2003), the latter of which was a crossover with &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;. &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; later got its own feature-length film in 2002.

That same year, Klasky Csupo was commissioned by McDonald&#x27;s to develop &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;, a series of six animated videos featuring the company&#x27;s mascot, Ronald McDonald, which were distributed directly to consumers via participating McDonald&#x27;s restaurants on VHS. On December 23, 1998, CEO Terry Thoren concluded an eleven-month negotiation with the car industry Mercedes-Benz and moved the company into the state-of-the-art studio in Los Angeles.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Klasky Csupo began producing two more shows for Nickelodeon: &quot;Rocket Power&quot; and &quot;As Told by Ginger&quot;. They also produced the first series of &quot;Stressed Eric&quot;, BBC Two&#x27;s first adult-oriented animated series.

In 2001, in honor of the tenth anniversary of &quot;Rugrats&quot;, Klasky Csupo released a two-part television special entitled &quot;All Growed Up&quot;, which featured all of the titular babies as teens. It was popular enough that Nick commissioned a series based on that special, titled &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, which ran on the channel from 2003 to 2008. On September 29, 2001, Class-Key Chew-Po signed animation director Chris Prynoski and his company Titmouse, Inc. for commercial representation.

In 2003, Klasky Csupo and Titmouse, Inc. were commissioned by Cartoon Network to produce a music video by the band They Might Be Giants for their song &quot;Dee Dee and Dexter&quot;, which features characters from &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; drawn by the studio in anime style. Class-Key Chew-Po Animated Commercials and Broadcast Design were then folded into Ka-Chew! the following year.

Also in 2003, the studio began work on &quot;The Way the Dead Love&quot;, a theatrical film that was set to adapt seven short stories from German-American writer Charles Bukowski from a script penned by Bruce Wagner. The film was developed under the studio&#x27;s Global Tantrum division, with Winchester Films being tapped to co-produce the film with the studio, as well as providing sales for the film. It was to be directed by Igor Kovalyov and Laslo Nosek, with names like Radiohead and Peter Gabriel being attached to compose the feature. Slated for a 2006 release, the year came and went without it. The project was then revived that same year at Warner Independent Pictures, with Johnny Depp being attached to co-produce and serve as the voice of the film&#x27;s main character. Once again, the project was silently scrapped. Had it been completed, the film would have been the first R-rated feature from the studio.

In 2005, the company again worked for Cartoon Network on the shorts &quot;Oogloo + Anju&quot;, &quot;Food Court Diaries&quot;, and &quot;The Topside Rag&quot; for &quot;Sunday Pants&quot; under Ka-Chew!.

=== Decline and dormancy (2006–2008)===
In the mid-2000s, Klasky Csupo ceased production on their Nickelodeon shows and their long-running partnership soon ended. In 2006, the longtime CEO of the company, Terry Thoren, left the studio and they dissolved the remainder of their 401(k) program, leading them to a period of dormancy and inactivity.

In fall 2006, Klasky Csupo announced the development of 28 new animated cartoon pilots that were to be up for sale at a later date. Each pilot was animated in different designs, instead of the typical style the studio was famous for. As of 2010, some of the cartoons had yet to be finished. Gabor Csupo would later post the remains of the cartoons on his YouTube channel. One of the pilots, &quot;Chicken Town&quot;, was picked up as a series by French company Ellipsanime, though Klasky Csupo was not involved with it.

In 2007, Paul Demeyer left Klasky Csupo to found Wild Canary, taking some of Ka-Chew!&#x27;s clients with him. In 2008, Ka-Chew! celebrated its 10th anniversary by expanding its roster of directors, before being absorbed into 6 Point Media in April 2011. In the same year, the studio released its final film to date, &quot;Immigrants&quot;, which was originally produced as an unaired animated series for Spike TV.

=== Return of the company with new projects (2012–present) ===
In 2012, Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo reopened the company after nearly four years of dormancy. Along with Craig Singer, the studio created its first new project in four years, &quot;Ollie Mongo&quot;, a digital comic book about a teenage skateboarding zombie who lives 200 years in the future. In 2015, the company announced that they were working on &quot;RoboSplaat!&quot;, a web series featuring the character with a robotic voice from their 1998 on-screen logo, given the name &quot;Splaat&quot; (currently voiced by Greg Cipes). The logo featuring him was retired in 2008, but was revived in 2021 along with the premiere of the Rugrats revival; the logo continues to appear on productions from the company. The web series premiered on December 21, 2016 and an app based on the web series is also currently in development. That same year, Klasky Csupo also announced that they were working on some &quot;top secret projects&quot;.

On September 2, 2015, it was announced that Nickelodeon may &quot;seek to experiment with retooled versions of classics&quot; that could include &quot;Rugrats&quot;. The following day, &quot;The Independent&quot; announced that &quot;Rugrats&quot; &quot;could soon be back on our screens too&quot;. At San Diego Comic-Con in 2016, Arlene Klasky explained that she would be willing to work on a revival of the series along with co-creators Gábor Csupó and Paul Germain.

On July 16, 2018, Nickelodeon announced a revival/reboot of &quot;Rugrats&quot; consisting of a 26-episode order. Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó would return as executive producers for the revived series. Using CGI animation rather than traditional hand-drawn animation used in the original series, the new &quot;Rugrats&quot; premiered on Paramount+, the streaming service for Nickelodeon parent Paramount Global, on May 27, 2021.

In April 2022, Gabor Csupo launched an NFT project titled &quot;Cosa Monstra&quot;.

== &quot;RoboSplaat!&quot; ==
RoboSplaat! is an American animated web series created by Arlene Klasky for YouTube. The series is about Splaat, an ink splat, who is voiced by Greg Cipes, who also voiced Beast Boy from &quot;Teen Titans&quot;.

=== &quot;RoboSplaat!&quot; characters ===
==== Splaat ====
* Splaat (voiced by Greg Cipes) is the main character in the series. He is a purple ink splat with two weird yellow rectangles, the upper has blue eyes, while the lower has a mouth with red lips. He wears black long sleeves and red and white sneakers, each with a white shoelace tied. He also appeared in the Klasky Csupo logo, albeit with no limbs, a more realistic look, a robotic voice, and his ink splat is black on a blue background. Prior to 2012, he was commonly referred to as a robot, before it was revealed that he is a &quot;splaat&quot;.

==== Splaat&#x27;s family ====
* Digital (voiced by Debi Derryberry) is Splaat&#x27;s 12-year-old/younger brother. Unlike Splaat, the rectangles are red instead of yellow, his lips are blue instead of red, and wears a black short-sleeved shirt with a white sound shape and grey and white shoes, each with a black shoelace tied.
* Sergei (voiced by Cooper Barnes) is the father of Splaat and Digital and the husband of Blossom. He is an ink bottle with sea-green eyes and pink lips. He wears purplish black armless sleeves and black shoes. 
* Blossom (voiced by Candi Milo) is the mother of Splaat and Digital, the wife of Sergei, and the only female and legless member of Splaat&#x27;s family. She is a pair of blue scissors with blue eyes and a weird yellow rectangle that has a mouth with red lips. She wears an orange skirt and gloves.
* Grandpa (voiced by Richard Tanner) is the grandfather of Splaat and Digital and the father of Sergei. He is a grey ink splat with blue eyes and black eyebrows and wears green glasses, a black suit with a green shirt and a purple necktie, and brown shoes.

<text>In economics, insurance, and risk management, adverse selection is a market situation where asymmetric information results in a party taking advantage of undisclosed information to benefit more from a contract or trade.

In an ideal world, buyers should pay a price which reflects their willingness to pay and the value to them of the product or service, and sellers should sell at a price which reflects the quality of their goods and services. However, when one party holds information that the other party does not have, they have the opportunity to damage the other party by maximizing self-utility, concealing relevant information, and perhaps even lying. This opportunity has secondary effects: the party without the information may take steps to avoid entering into an unfair contract, perhaps by withdrawing from the interaction; a party may ask for higher or lower prices, diminishing the volume of trade in the market; or parties may be deterred from participating in the market, leading to less competition and higher profit margins for participants.

A standard example is the market for used cars with hidden flaws, also known as lemons. George Akerlof in his 1970 paper, &quot;The Market for &#x27;Lemons&#x27;&quot;, highlights the effect adverse selection has on the used car market, creating an imbalance between the sellers and the buyers that may lead to a market collapse. The paper further describes the effects of adverse selection in insurance as an example of the effect of information asymmetry on markets, a sort of &quot;generalized Gresham&#x27;s law&quot;.

The theory behind market collapse starts with consumers who want to buy goods from an unfamiliar market. Sellers, who have information about which good is high or poor quality, would aim to sell the poor quality goods at the same price as better goods, leading to a larger profit margin. The high quality sellers now no longer reap the full benefits of having superior goods, because poor quality goods pull the average price down to one which is no longer profitable for the sale of high quality goods. High quality sellers thus leave the market, thus reducing the quality and price of goods even further. This market collapse is then caused by demand not rising in response to a fall in price, and the lower overall quality of market provisions. Sometimes the seller is the uninformed party instead, when consumers with undisclosed attributes purchase goods or contracts that are priced for other demographics.

Adverse selection has been discussed for life insurance since the 1860s, and the phrase has been used since the 1870s.

== Examples ==
===Insurance===
Adverse selection was first described for life insurance. It creates a demand for insurance which is positively correlated with the insured&#x27;s risk of loss.

For example, overall, non-smokers have a much lower risk of death than smokers of the same age and sex. If the price of insurance does not vary according to smoking status, then it will be more valuable for smokers than for non-smokers. Thus smokers will have a greater incentive to buy insurance and will purchase more insurance than non-smokers. This increases the average mortality rate of the insured pool, causing the insurer to pay more claims. The insurer relies on the premiums of the healthy non-smokers to cover the costs incurred by the smokers. As more smokers purchase insurance, costs to insure them increases.

In response, the company may increase premiums to correspond to the higher average risk. However, higher prices cause rational non-smokers to cancel their insurance as insurance becomes uneconomic for them, exacerbating the adverse selection problem. Eventually, higher prices will push out all non-smokers in search of better options, and the only people left who will be willing to purchase insurance are smokers. The same applies to health insurance.

To counter the effects of adverse selection, insurers may require premiums that reflect the customer&#x27;s risk, distinguishing high-risk from low-risk individuals. For instance, medical insurance companies ask a range of questions and may request medical or other reports on individuals who apply to buy insurance. The premium can be varied accordingly, and any unacceptably high-risk individuals are rejected (&quot;cf.&quot; pre-existing condition). This risk selection process is part of underwriting. In many countries, insurance law incorporates an &quot;utmost good faith&quot; or &quot;uberrima fides&quot; doctrine, which requires potential customers to answer any questions asked by the insurer fully and honestly. Dishonesty may be met with refusals to pay claims.

Adverse selection can also result from government regulations prohibiting insurers from setting prices based on certain information. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;regulatory adverse selection&quot;. For instance, the US government enacted the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which prohibits insurers from charging higher prices based on pre-existing conditions and gender. To help prevent adverse selection, the ACA was designed with a risk adjustment programme to compensate insurers with sicker enrollees. The ACA also required US residents to enroll in healthcare coverage or pay a tax penalty. This was in place to ensure enrollment by healthy individuals, even though they are less likely to claim and thus they may not otherwise have considered the coverage to be financially worthwhile.

Empirical evidence of adverse selection is mixed. Several studies investigating correlations between risk and insurance purchase have failed to show the predicted positive correlation for life insurance, auto insurance, and health insurance. On the other hand, &quot;positive&quot; test results for adverse selection have been reported in health insurance, long-term care insurance, and annuity markets.

Weak evidence of adverse selection in certain markets suggests that the underwriting process is effective at screening high-risk individuals. Another possible reason is the negative correlation between risk aversion (such as the willingness to purchase insurance) and risk level (estimated beforehand based on hindsight observation of the occurrence rate for other observed claims) in the population. If risk aversion is higher among lower-risk customers, adverse selection can be reduced or even reversed, leading to &quot;advantageous&quot; selection. This occurs when a person is both less likely to engage in risk-increasing behaviour are more likely to engage in risk-decreasing behaviour, such as taking affirmative steps to reduce risk.

For example, there is evidence that smokers are more willing to do risky jobs than non-smokers. This greater willingness to accept risk may reduce insurance policy purchases by smokers.

From a public policy viewpoint, some adverse selection can also be advantageous. Adverse selection may lead to a higher fraction of total losses for the whole population being covered by insurance than if there were no adverse selection.

=== Capital markets ===
When raising capital, some types of securities are more prone to adverse selection than others. An equity offering for a company that reliably generates earnings at a good price will be bought up before an unknown company&#x27;s offering, leaving the market filled with less desirable offerings that were unwanted by other investors. Assuming that managers have inside information about the firm, outsiders are most prone to adverse selection in equity offers. This is because managers may offer stock when they know the offer price exceeds their private assessments of the company&#x27;s value. Outside investors, therefore, require a high rate of return on equity to compensate them for the risk of buying a &quot;lemon&quot;.

Adverse selection costs are lower for debt offerings. When debt is offered, this acts as a signal to outside investors that the firm&#x27;s management believes the current stock price is undervalued, as the firm would otherwise be keen on offering equity.

Thus the required returns on debt and equity are related to perceived adverse selection costs, implying that debt should be cheaper than equity as a source of external capital, forming a &quot;pecking order&quot;.

The example described assumes that the market does not know managers are selling stock. The market could gain access to this information, perhaps by finding it in company reports. In this case, the market will capitalize on the information found. If the market has access to the company&#x27;s information, the presence of information asymmetry is removed, and as such there is no longer a state of adverse selection.

The presence of adverse selection in capital markets results in excessive private investment. Projects that otherwise would not have received investments due to having a lower expected return than the opportunity cost of capital, received funding as a result of information asymmetry in the market. As such, governments must account for the presence of adverse selection in the implementation of public policies.

=== Contract theory ===

In modern contract theory, &quot;adverse selection&quot; characterizes principal-agent models in which an agent has private information &quot;before&quot; a contract is written. For example, a worker may know his effort costs (or a buyer may know his willingness-to-pay) &quot;before&quot; an employer (or a seller) makes a contract offer. In contrast, &quot;moral hazard&quot; characterizes principal-agent models where there is symmetric information at the time of contracting. The agent may become privately informed &quot;after&quot; the contract is written. According to Hart and Holmström (1987), moral hazard models are further subdivided into hidden action and hidden information models, depending on whether the agent becomes privately informed due to an unobservable action that he himself chooses or due to a random move by nature. Hence, the difference between an adverse selection model and a hidden information (sometimes called hidden knowledge) model is simply the timing. In the former case, the agent is informed at the outset. In the latter case, he becomes privately informed after the contract has been signed.

In most adverse selection models, it is assumed that the agent&#x27;s private information is &quot;soft&quot; (i.e., the information cannot be certified). Yet, there are also some adverse selection models with &quot;hard&quot; information (i.e., the agent may have evidence to prove that claims he makes about his type are true).

Adverse selection models can be further categorized into models with private values and models with interdependent or common values. In models with private values, the agent&#x27;s type has a direct influence on his own preferences. For example, he has knowledge over his effort costs or his willingness-to-pay. Alternatively, models with interdependent or common values occur when the agent&#x27;s type has a direct influence on the principal&#x27;s preferences. For instance, the agent may be a seller who privately knows the quality of a car.

Seminal contributions to private value models have been made by Roger Myerson and Eric Maskin, while interdependent or common value models have first been studied by George Akerlof. Adverse selection models with private values can also be further categorized by distinguishing between models with one-sided private information and two-sided private information. The most prominent result in the latter case is the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem. More recently, contract-theoretic adverse selection models have been tested both in laboratory experiments and in the field.

===Banking===
When banks and borrowers come together to determine the personal loans, mortgages or business loans, adverse selection is deeply rooted in the discussions.

For example, when a new customer approaches a bank seeking a personal loan, they will always know their spending, saving and potential income better than the bank would. This creates adverse selection as the customer possess information about their life which is unknown to the bank, and they can take an economic advantage due to this information.

Similarly, when a business requests a loan from a bank, this also creates adverse selection. The business possesses information about market trends, insider business knowledge, and other future happenings relevant to the business that a bank would not know when lending money to a company. 

A further case where adverse selection is relevant is when banks trade loans. This process creates adverse selection, as when a bank transfers a loan to a new bank, they are unaware of how risky the borrower is and the other associated risks that go along with banks lending their money.

To counteract the effects of adverse selection, banks have moved towards building stronger relationships with their customers, to assist in further understanding some of the hidden information the consumers have when they are borrowing from banks. Furthermore, banks can adjust interest rates to help alleviate some of they unknown risks involved. Banks have also implemented heavier screening on loan applicants so that they are receiving the full picture when they lend their money to borrowers. They are investing significant amounts of resources to gather enough information on borrowers to help estimate the possibility of the loan being repaid by the borrower. Additionally, banks have implemented limits on lending for some borrowers to lower the risk of customers defaulting on their loan.

Banks have been trying to implement as many safeguards as possible on the borrowing process to try to limit the effects of adverse selection on their business. 

== Reducing adverse selection ==

Accounting for the significant amount of credence goods in the market, the incentives for misbehaviour among both buyers and sellers serve as large threats to market efficiencies to society as a whole. Since adverse selection largely persists due to asymmetric information, the key steps to reducing its effects starts with eliminating said asymmetry by encouraging transparency between both sides of the market.

=== Signalling and screening ===
In markets where the seller has private information about the product they wish to sell, reputation mechanisms help to reduce adverse selection by acting as a signal of quality. An example would be the online marketplace, eBay. A seller known for selling high-quality goods can further enhance its reputation by utilizing eBay&#x27;s reputation system. There is an incentive for the seller to do so, as buyers who derive utility from purchasing the product are naturally inclined to source their purchase from high-quality sellers. As such, buyers are able to rely on the reputation system as a signal to filter high-quality sellers from low-quality sellers.

Unlike quality signalling where the better informed party acts first, screening is better suited when the uninformed party needs to make the initial decision in participating in a contract. Recognizing that adverse selection stems from the lack of information, using screening games allows players to try and analyse if the risk of the contract&#x27;s worst possible outcome makes participating worth it in the first place. Parties can always attempt to be better informed, but if achieving new information is too costly, and the threat of economic loss from the contract is too great, screening methodologies suggest not participating in the contract at all.

For better context using the example of how adverse selection occurs in financial markets, if investors believe the risk of poor returns is too high, and the cost of consulting a trading specialist is not worth it, they have screened the possible outcomes and realize it is not worth making that initial investment from the start.

=== Lemon law ===

Lemon laws act as a form of consumer protection in the event the buyer purchase a defective product. While usually applied to automobiles, lemon laws are also used for most consumer goods. Such regulations were enacted to reduce cases where manufacturers knowingly sold defective products. Lemon laws vary by countries, but generally require the seller to repurchase the product or replace it. For example, the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices allows for consumers to sue for triple damages in the event of sustaining harm as a result of purchasing a defective product as a result of the seller withholding information at the time of the transaction. As such, government regulations act as a deterrent against sellers exploiting the asymmetric information between the parties involved. This, in turn, reduces the problem of adverse selection, as buyers who are knowingly protected by lemon laws are more inclined to engage in transactions they previously would not have done so due to the lack of viable information available to them.

=== Warranties ===
By offering a warranty for the product the seller intends to sell, they are able to indirectly communicate private information about the product to the buyer. Warranties assist in conveying information about the seller&#x27;s confidence in the product for its quality, by acting as a guarantee on the product. 
A common example is in the used car market, where apart from warranties offered by the seller itself, the buyer may purchase 
additional warranties in the form of insurance from third-party companies.

== Moral hazard ==
A related form of market failure is moral hazard. With moral hazard, the asymmetric information between the parties causes one party to increase their risk exposure &quot;after&quot; the transaction is concluded, whereas adverse selection occurs &quot;before&quot;. Moral hazard suggests that customers who have insurance may be more likely to behave recklessly than those who do not. Adverse selection, on the other hand, suggests that customers will withhold information about existing health conditions from the health insurer when purchasing insurance.

Realistic scenarios that actively involve both economic phenomena would include the market for rental properties. Adverse selection occurs in the process of deciding &quot;before&quot; renting or buying a property (&quot;the contract&quot;). Those who are uncommitted to doing the regular upkeep of the house due to time constraints, are ill-prepared to compensate for damages, or just innately irresponsible, are more likely to rent. In contrast to a person who is interested in buying, they would be less willing to maintain a property in good condition for the long-term. These &quot;types&quot; of renters would then take advantage of the asymmetric information between the landlord, who would ideally want to lease the property to tenants &quot;without&quot; these characteristics. Moral hazards takes place &quot;after&quot; the contract. Tenants are more likely to change their behaviour after moving in, as there are less incentives to be good tenants since the property is not theirs and they can leave as soon as their lease ends. This would mean less inclination to maintain good upkeep, or being liable for anything the landlord should be responsible for. Both adverse selection and moral hazard is at play here, but occur at different points in time and are due to asymmetric information regarding different factors. In the latter case, however, it could be argued that there is no real issue of asymmetric information at play, given that the source of the behaviour change is a particular incentive structure which all parties are aware of.

===Adverse selection in game theory===

The crisis of various financial markets makes people pay more and more attention to the market analysis of markets with adverse selection, especially the credit market and insurance market. Most of the current market analysis on competitive equilibrium market with adverse selection is based on the research results of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976). We can also add adverse selection to a broad form of competitive market games. It allows companies to offer any limited contract, as well as a price differential subsidy. At the same time, the company pulled out of the market after initial contract offers were observed. In such cases, Netzer, Nick and Florian (2014) proved that perfect equilibrium in subgames always exists. When the withdrawal is costless, the set of equilibrium outcomes may correspond to the entire set of feasible contracts. We then focus on robust equilibria that continue to exist for small withdrawal costs. Netzer, Nick and Florian (2014) suggested that the Miyazaki—Wilson contracts are the unique, robust equilibrium outcome in this case.

===Adverse selection in business===

In business dealings, buyers and sellers often encounter information asymmetry. For example, manufacturers may generally be more accurate than suppliers in predicting demand for their products. Another example is the acquisition of a company in which senior management of the target company has a deeper understanding of the information and value of the company&#x27;s intangible assets than the acquirer. However, most of the theoretical research on the contract between buyer and seller assumes that private information is unverifiable. Therefore, informed buyers can make arbitrary claims about subjective information parameters. Patrick (2014) believes that private information is verifiable in practice.

===Adverse selection and collateral in lending market===

In accordance with the research from Loannidou, Pavanini &amp; Peng in April 2022, the adverse selection theory also plays a significant role in determining the lending market performance based on the incremental costs of collateral and debt contracts. 

While the recent research also pointed out that, in separation of ex ante and ex post channels of collateral, the increasing level of adverse selection moral problem is having significant effects on bond markets and lenders&#x27; spirit. While the empirical evidences and statistical model both suggested that, the utilization of collateral could reduce the negative effect of adverse selection. In practice, through the promotion of information sharing system and credit rating mechanism, it is expected that, within the lending market regulations on collateral contact, the relevant stakeholder could have better incentives and techniques to reduce the social welfare cost that is cause by adverse selection. 

By including a separate borrower, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that, under the diversification lending strategy, the implementation of collateral could effectively mitigate the adverse selection issues, and adjust the borrower&#x27;s financial behaviour into a positive direction. 

===Adverse selection with asymmetric information in the mortgage market===

In the acquisition of commercial mortgages between the sellers and borrowers, the adverse selection problem will appear corresponding with the phenomenon of asymmetric information. In case of CMBS, An, Deng &amp; Gabriel (2010) pointed out that, due to the unequal information on the secondary market loans, it reinforce the conduit on lenders about the mortgage quality and information. The investors on mortgage market will effectively consider the effect of adverse selection, which correspondingly lead to a lower price margin on loans and portfolios in the market. To sum up, although the agency problem does not appears in junk loans and bonds, it still add the dissatisfied opinion on investor&#x27;s behaviours.

<doc id="309457" wikidata="Q807980" url="?curid=309457" title="Barcode reader">
<text>A barcode reader or barcode scanner is an optical scanner that can read printed barcodes and send the data they contain to computer. Like a flatbed scanner, it consists of a light source, a lens, and a light sensor for translating optical impulses into electrical signals. Additionally, nearly all barcode readers contain &quot;decoder&quot; circuitry that can analyse the barcode&#x27;s image data provided by the sensor and send the barcode&#x27;s content to the scanner&#x27;s output port.

== Types of barcode scanners ==

=== Technology ===

Barcode readers can be differentiated by technologies as follows:

==== Pen-type readers ====
Pen-type readers consist of a light source and photodiode that are placed next to each other at the tip of a pen. To read a barcode, the person holding the pen must move the tip of it across the bars at a relatively uniform speed. The photodiode measures the intensity of the light reflected back from the light source as the tip crosses each bar and space in the printed code. The photodiode generates a waveform that is used to measure the widths of the bars and spaces in the barcode. Dark bars in the barcode absorb light and white spaces reflect light so that the voltage waveform generated by the photodiode is a representation of the bar and space pattern in the barcode. This waveform is decoded by the scanner in a manner similar to the way Morse code dots and dashes are decoded.

==== Laser scanners ====

Laser barcode scanners utilize a semiconductor laser diode to produce a laser beam. This beam is directed by a deflection mirror onto a polygon mirror wheel. The design may include a focusing device, enabling the scanner to adjust the beam to scan at various distances.

The scanner deflects the laser beam using a rotating mirror wheel. This wheel deflects the beam line by line over the barcode at frequencies between 200 Hz and 1200 Hz in most scanners. The deflected beam exits the scanner spread at an opening angle, which is dependent on scanner design. The deflection allows it to traverse the barcode in a reading plane, effectively turning it into a &quot;reading beam.&quot; To accommodate stationary items, laser scanners incorporate oscillating mirrors that provide additional deflection perpendicular to the main scanning line. These mirrors function at frequencies that can vary from 0.1 Hz to about 5 Hz, ensuring that barcodes can be read at different orientations.

Photodetector receives light through the optical system consisting of the mirror wheel and an optical filter. The reflected light, rapidly varying in brightness with a data pattern, is then converted into an electrical signal and is subsequently amplified to a usable level for digital processing.

==== CCD readers (also known as LED scanners) ====

Charge-coupled device (CCD) readers use an array of hundreds of tiny light sensors lined up in a row in the head of the reader. Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it. Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small, and because there are hundreds of sensors lined up in a row, a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a barcode is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row. The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the barcode, whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself. LED scanners can also be made using CMOS sensors, and are replacing earlier Laser-based readers.

==== Camera-based readers ====
Two-dimensional imaging scanners are a newer type of barcode reader. They use a camera and image processing techniques to decode the barcode.

Video camera readers use small video cameras with the same CCD technology as in a CCD barcode reader except that instead of having a single row of sensors, a video camera has hundreds of rows of sensors arranged in a two dimensional array so that they can generate an image.

Large field-of-view readers use high resolution industrial cameras to capture multiple bar codes simultaneously. All the bar codes appearing in the photo are decoded instantly (ImageID patents and code creation tools) or by use of plugins (e.g. the Barcodepedia used a flash application and some web cam for querying a database), have been realized options for resolving the given tasks.

==== Omnidirectional barcode scanners ====
Omnidirectional scanning uses &quot;series of straight or curved scanning lines of varying directions in the form of a starburst, a Lissajous curve, or other multiangle arrangement are projected at the symbol and one or more of them will be able to cross all of the symbol&#x27;s bars and spaces, no matter what the orientation. Almost all of them use a laser. Unlike the simpler single-line laser scanners, they produce a pattern of beams in varying orientations allowing them to read barcodes presented to it at different angles. Most of them use a single rotating polygonal mirror and an arrangement of several fixed mirrors to generate their complex scan patterns.

Omnidirectional scanners are most familiar through the horizontal scanners in supermarkets, where packages are slid over a glass or sapphire window. There are a range of different omnidirectional units available which can be used for differing scanning applications, ranging from retail type applications with the barcodes read only a few centimetres away from the scanner to industrial conveyor scanning where the unit can be a couple of metres away or more from the code. Omnidirectional scanners are also better at reading poorly printed, wrinkled, or even torn barcodes.

==== Cell phone cameras ====

While cell phone cameras without auto-focus are not ideal for reading some common barcode formats, there are 2D barcodes which are optimized for cell phones, as well as QR Codes (Quick Response) codes and Data Matrix codes which can be read quickly and accurately with or without auto-focus.

Cell phone cameras open up a number of applications for consumers. For example:

* Movies: DVD/VHS movie catalogs.
* Music: CD catalogs – playing an MP3 when scanned.
* Book catalogs and device.
* Groceries, nutrition information, making shopping lists when the last of an item is used, etc.
* Personal Property inventory (for insurance and other purposes) code scanned into personal finance software when entering. Later, scanned receipt images can then be automatically associated with the appropriate entries. Later, the barcodes can be used to rapidly weed out paper copies not required to be retained for tax or asset inventory purposes.
* If retailers put barcodes on receipts that allowed downloading an electronic copy or encoded the entire receipt in a 2D barcode, consumers could easily import data into personal finance, property inventory, and grocery management software. Receipts scanned on a scanner could be automatically identified and associated with the appropriate entries in finance and property inventory software.
*Consumer tracking from the retailer perspective (for example, loyalty card programs that track consumers purchases at the point of sale by having them scan a QR code).

A number of enterprise applications using cell phones are appearing:

*Access control (for example, ticket validation at venues), inventory reporting (for example, tracking deliveries), asset tracking (for example, anti-counterfeiting).
* Recent versions of the Android, iOS, and Windows Phone mobile phone operating systems feature QR or barcode scanners built in, usually accessible from their respective camera application.

=== Housing ===
Barcode readers can be distinguished based on housing design as follows:

;Handheld scanner: with a handle and typically a trigger button for switching on the light like this are used in factory and farm automation for quality management and shipping.
;PDA scanner (or Auto-ID PDA): a PDA with a built-in barcode reader or attached barcode scanner.
;Automatic reader: a back office equipment to read barcoded documents at high speed (50,000/hour).
;Cordless scanner (or Wireless scanner): a cordless barcode scanner is operated by a battery fit inside it and is not connected to the electricity mains and transfer data to the connected device like PC.

===Barcode library===
Currently any camera equipped device or device which has document scanner can be used as Barcode reader with special software libraries, Barcode libraries. This allows them to add barcode features to desktop, web, mobile or embedded applications. In this way, combination of barcode technology and barcode library allows to implement with low cost any automatic document processing OMR, package tracking application or even augmented reality application.

== Methods of connection ==

=== Serial interfaces ===
Early barcode scanners, of all formats, almost universally used the then-common RS-232 serial interface. This was an electrically simple means of connection and the software to access it is also relatively simple, although needing to be written for specific computers and their serial ports.
As the PC with its various standard interfaces evolved, barcode readers began to use keyboard serial interfaces. The early &quot;keyboard wedge&quot; hardware plugged in between the PS/2 port and the keyboard, with characters from the barcode scanner appearing exactly as if they had been typed at the keyboard. Today the term is used more broadly for any device which can be plugged in and contribute to the stream of data coming &quot;from the keyboard&quot;. Keyboard wedges plugging in via the USB interface are readily available. In many cases, a choice of USB interface types (HID, CDC) are provided.

=== Proprietary interfaces ===
There are a few other less common interfaces. These were used in large EPOS systems with dedicated hardware, rather than attaching to existing commodity computers. In some of these interfaces, the scanning device returned analog signal proportional to the intensities seen while scanning the barcode. This was then decoded by the host device. In some cases the scanning device would convert the symbology of the barcode to one that could be recognized by the host device, such as Code 39.
=== Wireless networking ===
Some modern handheld barcode readers can be operated in wireless networks according to IEEE 802.11g (WLAN) or IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth). Some barcode readers also support radio frequencies viz. 433 MHz or 910 MHz. Readers without external power sources require their batteries be recharged occasionally, which may make them unsuitable for some uses.

== Resolution ==

The scanner resolution is measured by the size of the dot of light emitted by the reader. If this dot of light is wider than any bar or space in the bar code, then it will overlap two elements (two spaces or two bars) and it may produce wrong output. On the other hand, if a too small dot of light is used, then it can misinterpret any spot on the bar code making the final output wrong.

The most commonly used dimension is 13 mil (0.013 in or 0.33 mm), although some scanners can read codes with dimensions as small as 3 mil (0.003 in or 0.075 mm). Smaller bar codes must be printed at high resolution to be read accurately.

<doc id="309460" wikidata="Q704162" url="?curid=309460" title="Corentin Louis Kervran">
<text>Corentin Louis Kervran (3 March 1901 – 2 February 1983) was a French scientist. Kervran was born in Quimper, Finistère (Brittany), and received a degree as an engineer in 1925. In World War II he was part of the French Resistance.

Kervran proposed that nuclear transmutation occurs in living organisms, which he called &quot;biological transmutation&quot;. He made this claim after experimenting with chickens, which he believed showed that they were generating calcium in their eggshells while there was no calcium in their food or soil. He had no known scientific explanation for it. Such transmutations are not possible according to known physics, chemistry, and biology. Proponents of biological transmutations fall outside mainstream physics and are not part of accepted scientific discourse. Kervran&#x27;s ideas about biological transmutation have no scientific basis and are considered discredited.

==Biological transmutation==

In the 1960s, Kervran claimed to have conducted experiments and studies demonstrating violations of the law of conservation of mass by biological systems, according to which the amount of each chemical element is preserved in all chemical reactions. He claimed that organisms can transmute potassium into calcium by nuclear fusion in the course of making an eggshell:

Since biological systems do not contain mechanisms to produce the speed, temperature, and pressure necessary for such reactions, even for extremely short periods, this contradicts basic physical laws.

Kervran said that prior studies and reports of industrial carbon monoxide accidents supported his work. Kervran said that enzymes can facilitate biological transmutations using the weak nuclear force, by what he called &quot;neutral currents.&quot; His response to criticism was to claim that physical laws do not apply to biological reactions, which contradicts the mainstream understanding that physical laws apply for all scales and conditions.

Kervran suggested that under the right conditions, potassium could combine with hydrogen to form calcium. He questioned how chickens fed a diet of oats could produce eggshells composed of calcium carbonate and concluded that the potassium in the oats must combine with hydrogen to produce the calcium. He considered this a &quot;low-energy transmutation&quot; which became known as the &quot;Kervran effect&quot;. There is no scientific basis for such an effect. 

Italian researchers who studied Kervran&#x27;s theory in controlled conditions observed no transmutation. Contrary to what Kervran argued, oats are not devoid of calcium. If there isn&#x27;t enough calcium in a chicken&#x27;s diet, they will mobilize calcium from their bones. In modern times, chicken feed is often supplemented to ensure adequate calcium intake. Science writer Joe Schwarcz has written that &quot;the bottom line is that the Kervran effect doesn&#x27;t exist... [he] simply came to the wrong conclusion based on some faulty observations.&quot;

In 1993, Kervran was awarded a parodic Ig Nobel prize in Physics due to his &quot;improbable research&quot; in biological transmutation. The award description called him an &quot;ardent admirer of alchemy.&quot;

==Organic farming==

Organic farmers Raoul Lemaire (1884–1972) and Jean Boucher promoted Kervran&#x27;s discredited theory of biological transmutation, incorporating it into the Lemaire-Boucher organic farming method in the 1960s. They argued that their Lithothamnion-based fertilizer known as Calmagol underwent biological transmutation by transitioning calcium into potassium. Kervran took an interest in organic farming and was a contributor to Henri-Charles Geffroy&#x27;s &quot;La Vie Claire&quot; magazine. Kervran&#x27;s biological transmutation also influenced the macrobiotic diet of George Ohsawa. His book &quot;Biological Transmutations&quot; was first translated by Michel Abehsera, an Ohsawa disciple, in 1972.

<doc id="309462" wikidata="Q1143291" url="?curid=309462" title="Resident commissioner of the Philippines">
<text>The Resident Commissioner of the Philippine Islands to the United States () was a non-voting member of the United States House of Representatives sent by the Philippines from 1907 until its internationally recognized independence in 1946. It was similar to current non-voting members of Congress such as the resident commissioner of Puerto Rico and delegates from Washington, D.C., Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and other territories of the United States.

Like current non-voting members, resident commissioners could speak and otherwise participate in the business of the House, but did not have full voting rights. Two resident commissioners were sent until 1937, when after the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, the number was changed to one.

==History==
The Philippines was a United States territory from 13 August 1898 until Philippine independence was internationally recognized on 4 July 1946.

The office was first created by the Philippine Organic Act of 1902, section 8 and re-authorized on its subsequent replacements—the Jones Law of 1916 (known as the Philippine Autonomy Act) section 20, and the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934 (known as the Philippine Independence Act) section 7(5).

== Election ==
The procedures for appointment of the resident commissioners were ambiguous and a source of friction. Under the Philippine Organic Act of 1902, the two resident commissioners were to be elected by the Philippine Legislature, with each chamber (the entirely-appointed, American-majority Philippine Commission and the fully-elected and all-Filipino Philippine Assembly) voting separately. The resident commissioners were to be elected biennially from the time of the first meeting of the Philippine Legislature in 1907. Benito Legarda and Pablo Ocampo became the first two resident commissioners.

Upon the passage of the Jones Law in 1916, the resident commissioners were still selected in the same way, but by this time now had three-year terms. Jaime C. de Veyra and Teodoro R. Yangco were the first resident commissioners under the Jones Law.

The Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934 reduced the number of resident commissioners to one, and ordered the enactment of a new constitution. Upon the passage of the 1935 Constitution, it tasked the National Assembly (the successor of the Philippine Legislature) to legislate how the resident commissioner shall be selected. The National Assembly enacted Commonwealth Act No. 10 late in 1935, which stated how the next resident commissioner shall be selected; it stated that the resident commissioner would now be appointed by the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with the consent of the Commission on Appointments. and that the resident commissioner holds office at the pleasure of the president, therefore there was no fixed term.

The two resident commissioners serving under the Jones Law, Pedro Guevara and Francisco Afan Delgado, were replaced when President Manuel L. Quezon appointed Quintin Paredes as their successor in February 1936.

The resident commissioner was never elected via direct election. unlike its Puerto Rican counterpart.

<doc id="309463" wikidata="Q2983605" url="?curid=309463" title="Urotsukidōji">
<text>is a Japanese erotic horror manga series written and illustrated by Toshio Maeda.

First serialized in &quot;Manga Erotopia&quot; from 1985 to 1986, &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; marked a departure from Maeda&#x27;s earlier works, with its focus on erotica, dark humor, and the supernatural. Starting in 1987, the manga was adapted into a series of original video animation (OVA) anime releases by director Hideki Takayama. The adaptations deviate significantly from the manga, adding elements of violence, sadomasochism, and rape not present in the source material.

&quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; has been credited with popularizing the trope of tentacle rape, and &quot;The Erotic Anime Movie Guide&quot; calls it a formative work in the hentai genre. In 2005, it was voted as one of the 100 greatest cartoons in a poll by Channel 4.

==Synopsis==
===Manga===
Amano Jyaku, a mischievous, sociopathic demon/human hybrid, is banished to Earth and ordered by The Great Elder to find the &quot;Chōjin&quot;: the unbeatable god of the demon world who is hiding within the body of a man.

A group of reptilian/amphibian/insectoid demons want to find the &quot;Chōjin&quot; and use his power on behalf of the Queen of Demons. Under the leadership of Suikakuju, the Elder&#x27;s rival and lover of his estranged wife, the Queen of Demons, they hatch a series of plots to try to capture the &quot;Chōjin&quot;, most of which go horribly wrong.

Amano is sent to protect the &quot;Chōjin&quot;, but after his lecherous friend Koroko and then later his nymphomaniac sister Megumi come to find him, this proves to be more difficult.

===Anime===
Every 3,000 years the is united with the and the by the revival of the Super God (超神, &quot;Chōjin&quot;, known as the Overfiend in the English version). The saga follows Jyaku Amano—a man-beast—and his quest to find the &quot;Chōjin&quot; and to ensure the safe future of all three worlds. However, he finds his beliefs put to the test when he encounters numerous demons, who plan to destroy the &quot;Chōjin&quot; and prevent the three worlds from joining.

==Characters==
As the &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; saga spans over a number of years it incorporates a wide variety of characters. Below is a list of the main characters, which are split into their races:

===Ningen (&quot;Humans&quot;)===
; : The human through which the &quot;Chōjin&quot; would be reborn. He is shy and lecherous. Fated to mutate into the Demon of Destruction who decimates the world to pave the way for the birth of his &quot;messianic&quot; offspring.
; :In the anime, she is presented as a young, innocent, naive girl, and the idol at Myōjin University. In the manga, she is sometimes shown as more sexually adventurous. She becomes Nagumo&#x27;s girlfriend, and the mother of the &quot;Chōjin&quot;.
; : An anime-only character; Nagumo&#x27;s cousin, whom Münchhausen II uses to resurrect the Kyō-Ō. He commits a series of rapes and murders under the control of the German diabolist, who contorts his mind against those he loves. He falls for Megumi Amano, only to be killed by her in the battle against Münchhausen II atop the Shinjuku skyscrapers.
; : A school nerd who loves Akemi and jealously hates Nagumo. He is later used by Suikakujū as a vessel to destroy the &quot;Chōjin&quot;, with the aid of a demonic phallus which he promptly substitutes for his own. He meets his end at the hands of Nagumo, who tears out his organs.
; :The jock all the girls fall for in Myōjin University. He is a major character in the manga, though is only seen in the first volume of the OVA series. Jyaku mistakes him for the &quot;Chōjin&quot;, which ultimately leads to his demise.
; : A character who only appears in the manga, he is Niki&#x27;s bodyguard and childhood friend. Although he appears to be morbidly obese, he is very strong and attacks anyone who bullies Niki. He later befriends Nagumo and Akemi after Niki ditches him.

===Jūjin (&quot;Beast-men&quot;)===
; :The male protagonist of the saga, he has been searching for the &quot;Chōjin&quot; for three hundred years. He holds to his belief in the &quot;Chōjin&quot; and his Land of Eternity, until events play out in a way totally contrary to what he hoped for.
; : Jyaku&#x27;s nymphomaniac sister, she believes Tatsuo to be the &quot;Chōjin&quot; from the start. In the manga, her character is noticeably more malicious and antagonistic, where she tricks men into having sex with her only so she can either accuse them of rape and frame them for it, or eat them alive in her true monster form (which isn&#x27;t in the anime) and develops a petty grudge towards Akemi all because Nagumo chose her over Megumi, even going as far as to summon the demon king of the sea to try and kill Akemi (albeit, unsuccessfully) while they are at the beach. Although sharing the same hair cut and love for sex, her personality in the anime has been changed where she is much more kind-hearted and empathetic, with none of her sociopathic traits from the manga being present and also given much more screentime compared to her role in the manga, where she only appears in two chapters. She also falls in love with Nagumo&#x27;s cousin, Takeaki, in the anime.
; : An anime-only character. One of the wisest elders in the Man-Beast realm. In the anime, he helps Jyaku discover the truth behind the legend of the &quot;Chōjin&quot;. According to his own words in the second episode of the first OVA, The Great Elder has lived in the Man-Beast world for 993 years.
; : The Elder&#x27;s granddaughter and lover of Jyaku Amano. Her orgasm has the power to project visions of the future.

===Majin (&quot;Demons&quot;)===
; : Jyaku Amano&#x27;s rival, and the Demon Queen&#x27;s champion. His quest is to destroy the &quot;Chōjin&quot; in order to keep &quot;Makai&quot; (the &quot;Demon World&quot;) intact.
; : A demon who was banished to Hell for having an affair with Megumi a century ago, he later becomes Münchhausen II&#x27;s lackey. He is mortally wounded in battle with Amano and dies after rescuing Megumi. He is not featured in the manga.
; : In the manga, Ms. Togami is a nymphomaniac teacher who gets possessed by an iguana-like demon. The demon then tries to seduce Akemi, until Jyaku manages to drive the iguana-like demon out. He later tricks her into having sex, so that his magical sperm can protect her from the lizardlike demons. In the anime it is not explained whether or not she is possessed or a demon in disguise; a demon sent to Earth to hunt (and presumably destroy) the &quot;Chōjin&quot;. Despite her mission, she still finds time to rape Akemi, but Amano Jyaku intervenes and destroys her.
; Yoenki: An anime-only character. The sister of Suikakujū, she survives the merging of the three worlds, but is manipulated by Münchhausen II into believing that Amano Jyaku is responsible for her brother&#x27;s death.
; Goki, Yoki, and Sekki: Three demons searching for the &quot;Chōjin&quot;, who are later killed by Tatsuo. They appear only in the manga.

===Makemono (&quot;Demon-Beasts&quot;) (anime only)===
; Buju: A key character in the post-apocalyptic chapters of the saga. Starts off as a raping, pillaging marauder, only to find some semblance of purpose and redemption in becoming the Kyō-Ō&#x27;s guardian on his long journey toward Osaka to confront the &quot;Chōjin&quot;.
; Gashim: A kindhearted, elderly who accompanies Buju, Himi, Jyaku &quot;et al.&quot; to Osaka, following his release from Caesar&#x27;s captivity.
; Ruddle: Another spared from the devastating effects of Kyō-Ō&#x27;s Light of Judgment at Caesar&#x27;s palace. Joins Jyaku and the other in their journey toward Osaka.
; Idaten: A pure-hearted youth who takes the high road to Osaka with his fellows. He develops an unrequited crush on Himi. He is killed by Münchhausen II while attempting to defend Himi.

===Other characters===
; : A member of the Kuroko, a tribe of diminutive gray humanoids capable of flight. He holds deep respect for his boss, Amano Jyaku.
; : An anime-only character. He is a sorcerer following the footsteps of his father, a member of the Vril Society who died in the service of Adolf Hitler, hell-bent on resurrecting the &quot;Kyō-Ō&quot; and dominating the world. He carries an orb which grants him the ability to control demons and counter Amano Jyaku&#x27;s attacks. He initially tries to bend Takeaki to his will, but is defeated after Amano Jyaku mutilates him, forcing him to replace his lost body parts with mechanical prosthetics. He later adopts the pseudonym Faust and becomes an ally of Caesar. After Caesar is defeated, Münchhausen II finds Yoenki and uses her power to restore his body. He is finally killed by Himi when she unleashes her power.
; Caesar: An anime-only character; a former businessman and leader of a hedonistic cult, he discovers the legend of the &quot;Chōjin&quot; and attempts to summon it prematurely, resulting in the death of his daughter Alector. He vows revenge and turns himself into a cyborg. After Nagumo destroys the three worlds, Caesar allies himself with Münchhausen II and becomes a dictator leading a mixed army of humans and &quot;Makai&quot;, using Makemono as slave labor. He attempts to summon the &quot;Kyō-Ō&quot;, but is sidetracked by Buju kidnapping his daughter, now resurrected as an android. He ultimately sees the error of his ways and leaves Earth with Alector on a space shuttle.
; : An anime-only character. A supernatural being created by the &quot;Chōjin&quot; as part of a new race to both replace and exterminate the humans, Man-Beasts and demons. It has the ability to change its own gender whenever it wants, and it can also create other living beings and control the minds of other living beings into doing what it pleases. It appears in &quot;Urotsukidōji: The Final Chapter&quot;.
; : The Super God. His legend reveals that every three thousand years he will be reborn into the human realm. In the anime it is to unite the different worlds into a world of peace.
; : A deity worshipped by the Kuroko tribe, it is foretold to be the only being capable of defeating the &quot;Chōjin&quot;. Münchhausen II and Caesar both want to resurrect the &quot;Kyō-Ō&quot; and use it to take over the three worlds. The &quot;Kyō-Ō&quot; is conceived from the congealed blood of Takeaki at the Gokumon shrine, and comes to life as the baby girl Himi twenty years later after Buju rapes Alector in the shrine&#x27;s vicinity. She accompanies Buju and the other Makemono on their journey to Osaka, during which she kills Münchhausen II and eventually defeats the false Chōjin.
; : The demon that &quot;Suikakujū&quot; summons from the sea to kill the &quot;Chōjin&quot;. In the anime, &quot;Suikakujū&quot;″s summoning of the Sea Demon King in 1923 results in the Great Kantō earthquake.
; Faburil: An anime-only character. An avian demon created by Caesar and Münchhausen II to merge with the &quot;Kyō-Ō&quot; and serve them.

==Anime cast==
==Media==
===Manga===
&quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; was first serialized in four special editions of the erotic manga magazine &quot;Manga Erotopia&quot; from 25 July 1985 to 24 July 1986. It was later released into six &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes from 1 December 1986 to 1 April 1987.

&quot;Urotsukidōji: Legend of the Overfiend&quot; was first published in English with the launch of the adult label of CPM Manga in July 1998. It ran in a black-and-white 32-page format priced at $2.95 per issue. It was later released into six volumes from 1 September 2002 to 15 October 2003.

On 12 December 2014 English-language hentai publisher Fakku announced plans to launch a Kickstarter campaign to publish a remastered edition of the manga, which would include color pages and chapters omitted from the previous English versions. The campaign was launched on 20 June 2016. The campaign met its goal, and the first of four volumes was released on 8 December 2016.

===Anime===
There are four main chapters in the original &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; saga, along with an unfinished fifth chapter that has so far only been released in Japan and Germany, as well as a complete remake of the first chapter.

====&quot;Legend of the Overfiend&quot; (1987–1989)====
# (21 January 1987) Penthouse: Volume 3
# (21 March 1988) Penthouse: Volume 44
# (10 April 1989) Penthouse: Volume 58

The first series was released as part of an anthology video series distributed by JAVN (Japan Audio Visual Network). The anthology series was part of the international Penthouse Magazine brand and featured international and domestic pornographic movies (such as &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; and &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; to name a few).

The first three-volume series within the larger Penthouse series was named . These three episodes were adapted from the original manga but skip over much of the comedic sub-stories and subplots and instead shift the focus to the apocalypse and the battle between Suikakuju and Jyaku.

The three OVAs were later edited into a theatrical film known as . The removal of certain explicit material resulted in the film being given a rating from Japan&#x27;s Film Classification and Rating Organization. Shochiku-Fuji distributed the film to theaters while Shochiku Home Video distributed the film to VHS with the tagline .

&quot;Legend of the Over-Fiend&quot; was shown at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on 16 September 1989. A critic credited as &quot;Suze.&quot; wrote in &quot;Variety&quot; the film was a &quot;sci-fi-horror schlock extravaganza verging on porno. Films like this are why the word misogynist was invented.&quot;

The theatrical film was released in North America on VHS on 11 August 1993 by Central Park Media under the &quot;Anime 18&quot; label - it was their first title to be released with the label and it was rated NC-17. The film was also released in the UK and Australia, with additional cuts being made by the BBFC and OFLC.

; Plot
Planet Earth is not all it seems. It is revealed that humans are not alone and that there are unseen realms running parallel to our own: the realms of the Demons (&quot;Makai&quot;) and the Man-Beasts (&quot;Jyujinkai&quot;). To further that, there is a 3000-year-old legend that foretells the coming of the Overfiend (&quot;Chōjin&quot;)—a being of unimaginable power that will unite all three realms into a land of eternity.

The story follows the exploits of the protagonists—man-beast Jyaku Amano, his nymphomaniac sister Megumi and their companion Kuroko—as their 300-year search for the Overfiend takes them to a high school in Osaka, Japan. Their discoveries led them to two students: shy, lecherous Tatsuo Nagumo and school idol Akemi Ito. But as the film plunges deeper into the dark and gruesome, Jyaku discovers that the Legend of the Overfiend is not what it seems and that the future of the three realms may be strikingly different from what he is led to believe.

# &quot;Special DVD Edition&quot; (Manga Entertainment)—1:42:55
# &quot;Movie Edition&quot; (Kitty Media)—1:45:20

The &quot;Perfect Collection&quot; from Anime 18 is the only English-friendly uncut version of the first OVA available outside Japan. Other versions such as the one on the &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; boxed set and the Australian Madman release with both Legend of the Overfiend and Legend of the Demon Womb have been cut for 45 minutes in total, which included a total of 24 minutes of sexually-oriented scenes. The U.S. DVD releases are now out-of-print. The &quot;Movie Edition&quot;, licensed by Kitty Media in 2010 and released in 2011, is the first time any of the anime has been released on Blu-ray, though it is reformatted for widescreen (the DVD version released alongside it retains the original aspect ratio). On January 20, 2025, it was announced that Discotek Media will be rereleasing it on Blu-ray in 2025. The anime received an extensive restoration.

====&quot;Legend of the Demon Womb&quot; (1990–1991)====
# &quot;A Prayer for the Resurrection of the Lord of Chaos&quot; (1 December 1990)
# &quot;Battle at Shinjuku Skyscrapers&quot; (10 April 1991)
The second OVA series was named . This series was not based on the manga, but elements from it were used, with Negumo&#x27;s cousin Takeaki taking on a character similar to the character of Saburo in the manga and Münchhausen II taking after the character of Suikakuju.

The second part of the saga created an ongoing controversy among &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; fans as to where it fits into the saga as a whole. One main theory is that the two chapters happen between &quot;Birth of the Overfiend&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Overfiend&quot; of the first OVA. Another main theory is that since the characters and tone are fairly unfaithful to the first three OVAs, it ought not to be considered part of the canon in the first place.

The two OVAs were again later recut into a theatrical version, known as Urotsukidōji II: Legend of the Demon Womb; however, whereas the original two OVA episodes in this case censored sexual acts with blurring throughout, the movie edit was fully uncensored and even featured additional scenes with new animation and effects added to improve existing scenes. No material was taken out in the process—the time difference arising due to redundant credits and recaps—so the movie is to be considered the most complete version.

; Plot
Unbeknownst to Jyaku and Megumi, in 1944, the Nazis attempted to summon the Overfiend&#x27;s nemesis: the Lord of Chaos (Kyō-Ō). Top scientist Dr. Münchhausen and his son invented a perverse death-rape machine to summon the Lord of Chaos—but the machine overloaded; and helped to destroy half of Berlin—leaving Münchhausen II alive, but psychologically scarred.

During his adolescence, Münchhausen II discovers his father&#x27;s journal and tries to uncover the secrets of the &quot;Jyujinkai&quot; and the &quot;Makai&quot;. He finally succeeds and reawakens Kohoki—a demon banished to hell for eternity—into the human realm and the two form an infamous partnership.

Cut to the present day and Münchhausen II is trying to fulfill his father&#x27;s work—to summon the Lord of Chaos—but to make sure it will work this time, he needs a human sacrifice. And it just so happens Tatsuo&#x27;s cousin Takeaki Kiryu is on the next plane to Osaka...

# &quot;Urotsukidōji II: Legend of the Demon Womb&quot; (Anime 18)—1:26:51
# &quot;Special DVD Edition&quot; (Manga Entertainment)—1:23:32

The &quot;Perfect Collection&quot; from Anime 18 is the only uncut version of the second &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; OVA available outside Japan—however, even the Japanese version was censored, and this censoring was carried over. As mentioned above, this was rectified for the movie version which is uncensored and contains more original material than the OVAs. Anime 18&#x27;s DVD release is uncut though others (such as Manga UK&#x27;s) have again been censored with cuts made. Both Japanese and English-language tracks are included on Anime 18&#x27;s DVD of the movie, but there are no subtitles. Like the &quot;Perfect Collection&quot;, it is not region-coded. Other versions such as the one on the &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; boxed set and the Australian Madman release with both &quot;Legend of the Overfiend&quot; and &quot;Legend of the Demon Womb&quot; have been cut for 14 minutes in total, which included a total of 7 minutes of sexually-oriented scenes. The U.S. releases are also now out-of-print.

====&quot;Return of the Overfiend&quot; (1992–1993)====
# &quot;Birth of the True Overfiend&quot; (1 October 1992)
# &quot;The Mystery of Caesar&#x27;s Palace&quot; (21 January 1993)
# &quot;The Collapse of Caesar&#x27;s Palace&quot; (21 May 1993)
# &quot;Journey to an Unknown World&quot; (21 August 1993)

The third OVA series was named . This is where the saga begins to focus less on the remaining central characters and introduces other secondary characters, none of whom are present in the manga. The four parts were edited for western audiences as Urotsukidōji: Return of the Overfiend, in some cases cut into a pair of films.

; Plot
Twenty years have passed and the Chojin has been prematurely born. He summons Jyaku Amano to protect him and to help to discover what has happened, sending Jyaku forth to search for the evil born in the east. Unfortunately, a new race called the Makemono (Demon-Beasts) have arisen following the apocalypse, ruled over by the fanatical cyborg Caesar and his mysterious comrade &quot;Faust&quot;. It is apparent they are the cause behind these events and intend to resurrect the Kyō-Ō. Jyaku, along with the Makemono Buju and Caesar&#x27;s traitorous daughter Alector, need to stop the two dictators from ruling the land of eternity. The question is, who will succeed?

====&quot;Inferno Road&quot; (1993–1995)====
# &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (21 December 1993)
# &quot;The Long Road to God&quot; (21 March 1994)
# &quot;The End of the Journey&quot; (20 May 1995)

The fourth OVA series was named . It was banned outright in many countries (including Britain), but was edited again for the west under the title Urotsukidōji: Inferno Road.

Continuing straight after the climax of &quot;Return of the Overfiend&quot;, Jyaku and the survivors head for Osaka to help the Overfiend after his climactic battle. On the way they find a kingdom where children rule over adults (OVAs 1 and 2). Jyaku&#x27;s problems are furthered when an old nemesis shows up at the wrong time (OVA 3).

The third OVA in this series, &quot;The End of the Journey&quot;, stands alone plot-wise (wrapping up the story arc from &quot;Urotsukidoji: Return of the Overfiend&quot;, on which the first two OVA have no bearing), and was originally intended to be a theatrical release.

NOTE: Inferno Road was originally intended to have another ending, which was fully completed but ultimately discarded. This ending was to have revealed that the apparent Chōjin as seen at the start of &quot;Urotsukidoji: Return of the Overfiend&quot; was not in fact the real Chōjin, but yet another Makai. This alternate ending was to have set up the abandoned The Final Chapter.

====&quot;The Final Chapter&quot; (1996)====
# &quot;The Final&quot; (28 December 1996)

The fifth OVA series was named , also known as Urotsukidōji: The Final Chapter in the west. Only one episode of this was partially completed, the released version containing numerous examples of animation that is missing in-between frames.

; Plot
A century after the merging of the three worlds, the real Chōjin is born and creates a new hermaphroditic race to wipe out all remaining life on Earth. Akemi reawakens in a hospital, along with Jyaku, who had barely survived a recent confrontation with the Chōjin (whose form constantly mutates between male and female). Destroyer God Tatsuo also reappears (after supposedly being killed by Kyō-Ō in &quot;Urotsukidoji: Return of the Overfiend&quot;) and continues his ravaging of Earth. Still in love with Tatsuo, Akemi runs out to find him.

Meanwhile, Jyaku is confronted by some of the Chōjin&#x27;s new &#x27;children&#x27;, and engages them in battle. However, his efforts prove almost futile, as they are constantly regenerated by the Chojin.
Akemi eventually finds Tatsuo, still in his God form, and pleads with him. He clutches her in his hand (similarly to the end of the first episode) and prepares to kill her. However, she is rescued at the last minute by Jyaku, although she condemns him for doing so. By the end of the series, Amano Jyaku becomes dissillusioned with the Chōjin and declares war on it.

This series was named , also known as Urotsukidōji: New Saga in the west, and was released in North America on 9 March 2004. This three-disc collection is a retelling of the first episode in &quot;The Legend of the Overfiend&quot;. It has the same basic plot as &quot;Birth of the Overfiend&quot;, the main differences being that Ozaki is now one of the main characters, and the story focuses more on him, while Nagumo is now a supporting character. Furthermore, Megumi is completely absent, Akemi is a clairvoyant leader of a biker gang, Nikki is gender swapped and the queen of Makai is given a more active role.

==New &quot;Urotsukidoji&quot; manga==
After the popularity of the anime version of his work, Maeda would create a new Urotsukidoji manga in the early 90s that is a reboot of the original manga with a completely new story and characters. The protagonist of the story is Honoo Shishizawa, a young delinquent gang leader who obtains superhuman powers and discovers that the Chojin plans on remaking the world in his image, causing Honoo to make it his mission to destroy the Chojin and protect his world. Along the way, he meets Amano, Megumi and Kuroko, who are also after the Chojin.

The manga ran from 1991 to 1993.

==&quot;Heisei Urotsukidoji&quot; manga==
In 2008, Maeda once again created a reboot of the series, known as &quot;Heisei Urotsukidoji&quot; (平成うろつき童子). The manga itself is very hard to find and there very little information surrounding it. All that is known about the story is that Amano Jyaku teams up with an archaeologist to fight against a villainous force.

<doc id="309468" wikidata="Q208665" url="?curid=309468" title="Arthur Henderson">
<text>Arthur Henderson (13 September 1863 – 20 October 1935) was a British iron moulder and Labour politician. He was the first Labour cabinet minister, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934 and, uniquely, served three separate terms as Leader of the Labour Party in three different decades, and was elected to parliament in five by-elections in different constituencies. He was popular among his colleagues, who called him &quot;Uncle Arthur&quot; in acknowledgement of his integrity, his devotion to the cause and his imperturbability. He was a transitional figure whose policies were, at first, close to those of the Liberal Party. The trades unions rejected his emphasis on arbitration and conciliation, and thwarted his goal of unifying the Labour Party and the trade unions.

== Early life ==
Arthur Henderson was born at 10 Paterson Street, Anderston, Glasgow, Scotland, in 1863, the son of Agnes, a domestic servant, and David Henderson, a textile worker who died when Arthur was ten years old. After his father&#x27;s death, the Hendersons moved to Newcastle upon Tyne in the North-East of England, where Agnes later married Robert Heath.

Henderson worked at Robert Stephenson and Sons&#x27; General Foundry Works from the age of twelve. After finishing his apprenticeship there aged seventeen, he moved to Southampton for a year and then returned to work as an iron moulder (a type of foundryman) in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Henderson became a Methodist in 1879 (having previously been a Congregationalist) and became a Local Preacher. After he lost his job in 1884, he concentrated on preaching.

== Union leader ==
In 1892, Henderson entered the complex world of trade union politics when he was elected as a paid organiser for the Friendly Society of Iron Founders. He also became a representative on the North East Conciliation Board. Henderson believed that strikes caused more harm than they were worth and tried to avoid them whenever he could. For this reason, he opposed the formation of the General Federation of Trade Unions, as he was convinced that it would lead to more strikes.

== The Labour Representation Committee ==
In 1900 Henderson was one of the 129 trade union and socialist delegates who passed Keir Hardie&#x27;s motion to create the Labour Representation Committee (LRC). In 1903, Henderson was elected Treasurer of the LRC and was also elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnard Castle at a by-election. From 1903 to 1904, Henderson also served as mayor of Darlington, County Durham.

== The Labour Party ==

In 1906, the LRC changed its name to the Labour Party after it won 29 seats at the general election. In 1908, when Hardie resigned as Leader of the Labour Party, Henderson was elected to replace him. He remained Leader until his own resignation two years later, in 1910.

== Cabinet Minister ==
In 1914 the First World War broke out and Ramsay MacDonald resigned from the Leadership of the Labour Party in protest. Henderson was elected to replace him. The two became enemies.

In 1915, following Prime Minister H. H. Asquith&#x27;s decision to create a coalition government, Henderson became the first member of the Labour Party to become a member of the Cabinet, as President of the Board of Education.

In 1916, David Lloyd George forced Asquith to resign and replaced him as Prime Minister. Henderson became a member of the small War Cabinet with the post of Minister without Portfolio on 9 December 1916. The other Labour representatives who joined Henderson in Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government were John Hodge, who became Minister of Labour, and George Barnes, who became Minister of Pensions. Henderson resigned on 11 August 1917 after his proposal for an international conference on the war was rejected by the rest of the Cabinet. The Labour National Executive Committee had rejected the Second International&#x27;s request for a meeting of European socialist parties on the war in Stockholm, but after Henderson convinced it to give provisional support after visiting the Russian Republic as an envoy and recognizing that the Russian Provisional Government would collapse if the war continued.

In August 1917, three months before the Balfour Declaration, the Labour Party issued a statement in support of a Jewish state in Palestine. Henderson spoke in favor of a Jewish state.

Henderson turned his attention to building a strong constituency-based support network for the Labour Party. Previously, it had little national organisation, based largely on branches of unions and socialist societies. Working with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, Henderson in 1918 established a national network of constituency organisations. They operated separately from trade unions and the National Executive Committee and were open to everyone sympathetic to the party&#x27;s policies. Secondly, Henderson secured the adoption of a comprehensive statement of party policies, as drafted by Sidney Webb. Entitled &quot;Labour and the New Social Order,&quot; it remained the basic Labour platform until 1950. It proclaimed a socialist party whose principles included a guaranteed minimum standard of living for everyone, nationalisation of industry, and heavy taxation of large incomes and of wealth.

== The &quot;Coupon Election&quot; and the 1920s ==
Henderson lost his seat in the &quot;Coupon Election&quot; of 14 December 1918, which had been announced within twenty-four hours of the end of hostilities and which resulted in a landslide victory for a coalition formed by Lloyd George. Henderson returned to Parliament in 1919 after winning a by-election in Widnes. He then became Labour&#x27;s Chief Whip.

Vladimir Lenin held Henderson in very low regard. In a letter to the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Georgy Chicherin, written on 10 February 1922 and referring to the Genoa Conference, Lenin wrote: &quot;Henderson is as stupid as Kerensky, and for this reason he is helping us.&quot;
Henderson lost his seat again, at the general election of 1922. He returned to Parliament via another by-election, this time representing Newcastle East, but again, he was unseated at the general election of 1923. He returned to Parliament just two months later after winning another by-election in Burnley.

In 1924, Henderson was appointed as Home Secretary in the first-ever Labour government, led by MacDonald. This government was defeated later the same year and lost the general election that followed.

Having been re-elected in 1924, Henderson refused to challenge MacDonald for the party leadership. Worried about factionalism in the Labour Party, he published a pamphlet, &quot;Labour and the Nation&quot;, in which he attempted to clarify the party&#x27;s goals.

== Foreign Secretary ==
In 1929, Labour formed another minority government and MacDonald appointed Henderson as Foreign Secretary, a position Henderson used to try to reduce the tensions that had been building up in Europe since the end of the First World War. Diplomatic relations were re-established with the Soviet Union and Henderson guaranteed Britain&#x27;s full support to the League of Nations.

== The MacDonald &quot;betrayal&quot; ==
The Great Depression plunged the government into a terminal crisis. The Cabinet agreed that it was essential to maintain the Gold Standard and that the Budget needed to be balanced, but were divided over reducing unemployment benefits by 10%. At first, Henderson gave strong support to Prime Minister MacDonald throughout the financial and political crisis of August. The financial crisis across Europe was worsening and Britain&#x27;s gold reserves were at high risk. New York banks provided an emergency loan; but additional money was needed and to get it, the budget had to be balanced. MacDonald and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden proposed cuts in unemployment benefits. Henderson rejected that solution and became the leader of nearly half the Cabinet. The Labour Cabinet decided to resign. King George V implored MacDonald to remain and form an all-party National Government that would make the budget cuts. MacDonald agreed on 24 August 1931 and formed an emergency National Government, with members from all parties. The new cabinet had four Labourites (now called the &quot;National Labour Organisation&quot;) who stood with Macdonald, plus four Conservatives and two Liberals. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters from the party. Henderson cast the only vote against the expulsions. Against his inclinations, Henderson accepted the leadership of the main Labour Party and led it into the general election on 27 October against the cross-party National coalition. It was a disastrous result for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52. Yet again Henderson lost his seat, at Burnley. The following year, he relinquished the party leadership.

== Later career ==

Henderson returned to Parliament after winning a by-election at Clay Cross, achieving the unique feat of being elected five times at by-elections in constituencies where he had not previously been the MP. He holds the record for the greatest number of comebacks from losing a previous seat.

Henderson spent the rest of his life trying to halt the gathering storm of World War II. He worked with the World League of Peace and chaired the Geneva Disarmament Conference, and in 1934 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Henderson&#x27;s Nobel Prize medal was stolen in a burglary of the office of the Lord Mayor of Newcastle on 3 April 2013. A man was subsequently jailed for the theft; the medal has never been recovered.
Henderson died in 1935, aged 72, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. All three of Henderson&#x27;s sons saw military service during the Great War, the eldest, David, being killed in action in 1916 whilst serving as a Captain with the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own). His surviving sons also became Labour politicians: second son William was granted the title of Baron Henderson in 1945, while his third son, Arthur, was created Baron Rowley in 1966.

The Labour History Archive and Study Centre at the People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester holds the papers of Arthur Henderson in their collection, spanning from 1915 to 1935.

<doc id="309469" wikidata="Q1294433" url="?curid=309469" title="Resident commissioner of Puerto Rico">
<text>The resident commissioner of Puerto Rico () is a non-voting member of the United States House of Representatives elected by the voters of the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico every four years, the only member of the House of Representatives who serves a four-year term. Because the commissioner represents the entire territory of Puerto Rico irrespective of its population, and is not subject to congressional apportionment like those House members representing the 50 states, Puerto Rico&#x27;s at-large congressional district is the largest congressional district by population in all of the United States.

Commissioners function in every respect as a member of Congress, including sponsoring legislation and serving on congressional committees, where they can vote on legislation, but they cannot vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. They receive a salary of $174,000 per year and are identified as &quot;Member of Congress.&quot;

The current commissioner is Pablo José Hernández Rivera of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), the youngest person to hold the post. He is also affiliated with the Democratic Party (D) at the national level.

Other U.S. territories have a similar representative position called a &quot;delegate&quot;.

== History ==
The United States Congress had seated non-voting &quot;delegates&quot; from various territories since 1794 as the country expanded across North America; these territories were all eventually admitted as states. The position of delegate was a legislative position with a two-year term, just like a member of Congress.

The United States acquired several overseas possessions as a result of the Spanish–American War. While the House of Representatives voted in 1900 for Puerto Rico to select a delegate, Congress instead devised a new form of territorial representative in the resident commissioner. United States Senator John Coit Spooner argued that granting a territory a &quot;delegate&quot; implied that it was on the path to statehood, which he asserted was not guaranteed for the new possessions acquired in the war, such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines. In fact, more than a century later, neither has become a state. (Puerto Rico remains a U.S. territory, while the Philippines became an independent republic in 1946.)

The original resident commissioner positions served a two-year term, though it was later extended to four years starting in 1920. The position also had executive responsibility in addition to legislative ones. The term had been used as to parts of the British Empire (see resident commissioner), but in an almost opposite sense; sent or recognized as the Crown&#x27;s representative to manage a territory. In the American sense, resident commissioner always refers to a representative of a territory to the national government.

This representation has evolved over time. At first, the resident commissioner could not even be present on the floor of the House of Representatives; floor privileges were granted in 1902. In 1904, the officeholder gained the right to speak during debate and serve on the Committee on Insular Affairs, which had responsibility for the territories gained in the Spanish-American War.

In 1933, Resident Commissioner Santiago Iglesias was appointed to additional committees, and each of his successors has served on other committees also. But only in 1970 did the resident commissioner gain the right to vote in committees, gain seniority, or hold leadership positions.

The present-day resident commissioner, like the delegates from other territories and the District of Columbia, has almost all of the rights of other House members, including being able to sponsor bills and offer amendments and motions. Territorial representatives remain unable to vote on matters before the full House.

The position of Resident Commissioner in Washington is described as a democratic anomaly and does not meet any of the principles of true political representation. The Resident Commissioner acts as a case of macro-clientelism between the sole Resident Commissioner and all Puerto Ricans.

<doc id="309470" wikidata="Q1760683" url="?curid=309470" title="Explicit Congestion Notification">
<text>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an extension to the Internet Protocol and to the Transmission Control Protocol and is defined in (2001). ECN allows end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets. ECN is an optional feature that may be used between two ECN-enabled endpoints when the underlying network infrastructure also supports it.

Conventionally, TCP/IP networks signal congestion by dropping packets. When ECN is successfully negotiated, an ECN-aware router may set a mark in the IP header instead of dropping a packet in order to signal impending congestion. The receiver of the packet echoes the congestion indication to the sender, which reduces its transmission rate as if it detected a dropped packet.

Rather than responding properly or ignoring the bits, some outdated or faulty network equipment has historically dropped or mangled packets that have ECN bits set. , measurements suggested that the fraction of web servers on the public Internet for which setting ECN prevents network connections had been reduced to less than 1%.

Passive support has existed in Ubuntu Linux since 12.04 and in Windows Server since 2012. Passive support in the most popular websites has increased from 8.5% in 2012 to over 70% in May 2017. Adoption across the Internet now requires clients to actively request ECN. In June 2015, Apple announced that ECN will be enabled by default on its supported and future products, to help drive the adoption of ECN signaling industry-wide.

==Operation==
ECN requires specific support at both the Internet layer and the transport layer for the following reasons:
* In TCP/IP, routers operate within the Internet layer, while the transmission rate is handled by the endpoints at the transport layer.
* Congestion may be handled only by the transmitter, but since it is known to have happened only after a packet was sent, there must be an echo of the congestion indication by the receiver to the transmitter.

Without ECN, congestion indication echo is achieved indirectly by the detection of lost packets. With ECN, the congestion is indicated by setting the ECN field within an IP packet to CE (Congestion Experienced) and is echoed back by the receiver to the transmitter by setting proper bits in the header of the transport protocol. For example, when using TCP, the congestion indication is echoed back by setting the ECE bit.

===Operation of ECN with IP===
ECN uses the two least significant (right-most) bits of the Traffic Class field in the IPv4 or IPv6 header to encode four different code points:
* codice_1 – Not ECN-Capable Transport, Not-ECT
* codice_2 – ECN Capable Transport(1), ECT(1)
* codice_3 – ECN Capable Transport(0), ECT(0)
* codice_4 – Congestion Experienced, CE.

When both endpoints support ECN they mark their packets with ECT(0) or ECT(1). Routers treat the ECT(0) and ECT(1) codepoints as equivalent. If the packet traverses an active queue management (AQM) queue (e.g., a queue that uses random early detection (RED)) that is experiencing congestion and the corresponding router supports ECN, it may change the code point to codice_5 instead of dropping the packet. This act is referred to as &quot;marking&quot; and its purpose is to inform the receiving endpoint of impending congestion. At the receiving endpoint, this congestion indication is handled by the upper layer protocol (transport layer protocol) and needs to be echoed back to the transmitting node in order to signal it to reduce its transmission rate.

Because the CE indication can only be handled effectively by an upper layer protocol that supports it, ECN is only used in conjunction with upper layer protocols, such as TCP, that support congestion control and have a method for echoing the CE indication to the transmitting endpoint.

===Operation of ECN with TCP===
TCP supports ECN using two flags in the TCP header. The first, &quot;ECN-Echo&quot; (ECE) is used to echo back the congestion indication (i.e., signal the sender to reduce the transmission rate). The second, &quot;Congestion Window Reduced&quot; (CWR), to acknowledge that the congestion-indication echoing was received. Use of ECN on a TCP connection is optional; for ECN to be used, it must be negotiated at connection establishment by including suitable options in the SYN and SYN-ACK segments.

When ECN has been negotiated on a TCP connection, the sender indicates that IP packets that carry TCP segments of that connection are carrying traffic from an ECN Capable Transport by marking them with an ECT code point. This allows intermediate routers that support ECN to mark those IP packets with the CE code point instead of dropping them in order to signal impending congestion.

Upon receiving an IP packet with the &quot;Congestion Experienced&quot; code point, the TCP receiver echoes back this congestion indication using the ECE flag in the TCP header. When an endpoint receives a TCP segment with the ECE bit it reduces its congestion window as for a packet drop. It then acknowledges the congestion indication by sending a segment with the CWR bit set.

A node keeps transmitting TCP segments with the ECE bit set until it receives a segment with the CWR bit set.

To see affected packets with tcpdump, use the filter predicate codice_6.

====ECN and TCP control packets====
Since the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) does not perform congestion control on control packets (pure ACKs, SYN, FIN segments), control packets are usually not marked as ECN-capable.

A 2009 proposal suggests marking SYN-ACK packets as ECN-capable. This improvement, known as ECN+, has been shown to provide dramatic improvements to performance of short-lived TCP connections.

===Operation of ECN with other transport protocols===
ECN is also defined for other transport layer protocols that perform congestion control, notably DCCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The general principle is similar to TCP, although the details of the on-the-wire encoding differ.

It is possible to use ECN with protocols layered above UDP. However, UDP requires that congestion control be performed by the application, and early UDP based protocols such as DNS did not use ECN. More recent UDP based protocols such as QUIC are using ECN for congestion control.

==Effects on performance==
Since ECN is only effective in combination with an Active Queue Management (AQM) policy, the benefits of ECN depend on the precise AQM being used. A few observations, however, appear to hold across different AQMs.

As expected, ECN reduces the number of packets dropped by a TCP connection, which, by avoiding a retransmission, reduces latency and especially jitter. This effect is most drastic when the TCP connection has a single outstanding segment, when it is able to avoid an RTO timeout; this is often the case for interactive connections, such as remote logins, and transactional protocols, such as HTTP requests, the conversational phase of SMTP, or SQL requests.

Effects of ECN on bulk throughput are less clear because modern TCP implementations are fairly good at resending dropped segments in a timely manner when the sender&#x27;s window is large.

Use of ECN has been found to be detrimental to performance on highly congested networks when using AQM algorithms that never drop packets. Modern AQM implementations avoid this pitfall by dropping rather than marking packets at very high load.

==Implementations==
Many modern implementations of the TCP/IP protocol suite have some support for ECN; however, they usually ship with ECN disabled.

===ECN support in TCP by hosts===

====Microsoft Windows====
Windows versions since Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista support ECN for TCP. Since Windows Server 2012, it is enabled by default in Windows Server versions, because Data Center Transmission Control Protocol (DCTCP) is used. In previous Windows versions and non-server versions it is disabled by default.

ECN support can be enabled using a shell command such as .

====BSD====
On FreeBSD, ECN for TCP can be configured using the sysctl. By default, it is enabled only for incoming connections that request it. It can also be enabled for all connections or disabled entirely.

NetBSD 4.0 implements ECN support for TCP; it can be activated through the sysctl interface by setting 1 as value for the parameter.

Likewise, the sysctl can be used in OpenBSD.

====Linux====
Since version 2.4.20 of the Linux kernel, released in November 2002, Linux supports three working modes of the ECN for TCP, as configured through the sysctl interface by setting parameter to one of the following values:
* disable ECN and neither initiate nor accept it
* enable ECN when requested by incoming connections, and also request ECN on outgoing connection attempts
* (default) enable ECN when requested by incoming connections, but do not request ECN on outgoing connections

Beginning with version 4.1 of the Linux kernel, released in June 2015, the mechanism is enabled by default when ECN is enabled (the value of 1). The fallback mechanism attempts ECN connectivity in the initial setup of outgoing connections, with a graceful fallback for transmissions without ECN capability, mitigating issues with ECN-intolerant hosts or firewalls.

====Mac OS X====
Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 implement ECN support for TCP. It is controlled using the Boolean sysctl variables and . The first variable enables ECN on incoming connections that already have ECN flags set; the second one tries to initiate outgoing connections with ECN enabled. Both variables default to , but can be set to to enable the respective behavior.

In June 2015, Apple Inc. announced that OS X 10.11 would have ECN turned on by default, but the OS shipped without that default behavior. In macOS Sierra, ECN is enabled for half of TCP sessions.

====iOS====
In June 2015, Apple Inc. announced that iOS 9, its next version of iOS, would support ECN and have it turned on by default. TCP ECN negotiation is enabled on 5% of randomly selected connections over Wi-Fi / Ethernet in iOS 9 and 50% of randomly selected connections over Wi-Fi / Ethernet and a few cellular carriers in iOS 10 and 100% for iOS 11

====Solaris====
The Solaris kernel supports three states of ECN for TCP:
* no ECN
* use ECN
* only advertise ECN support when asked for.

As of Solaris 11.4, the default behavior is . ECN usage can be modified via .

===ECN support in IP by routers===
Since ECN marking in routers is dependent on some form of active queue management, routers must be configured with a suitable queue discipline in order to perform ECN marking.

Cisco IOS routers perform ECN marking if configured with the WRED queuing discipline since version 12.2(8)T.

Linux routers perform ECN marking if configured with one of the RED or GRED queue disciplines with an explicit &quot;ecn&quot; parameter, by using the sfb discipline, by using the CoDel Fair Queuing (fq_codel) discipline, or the CAKE queuing discipline.

Modern BSD implementations, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, have support for ECN marking in the ALTQ queueing implementation for a number of queuing disciplines, notably RED and Blue. FreeBSD 11 included CoDel, PIE, FQ-CoDel and FQ-PIE queuing disciplines implementation in ipfw/dummynet framework with ECN marking capability.

=== Data Center TCP ===
&quot;Data Center Transmission Control Protocol&quot; (&quot;Data Center TCP&quot; or &quot;DCTCP&quot;) utilizes ECN to enhance the Transmission Control Protocol congestion control algorithm. It is used in data center networks. Whereas the standard TCP congestion control algorithm is only able to detect the &quot;presence&quot; of congestion, DCTCP, using ECN, is able to gauge the &quot;extent&quot; of congestion.

DCTCP modifies the TCP receiver to always relay the exact ECN marking of incoming packets at the cost of ignoring a function that is meant to preserve signalling reliability. This makes a DCTCP sender vulnerable to loss of ACKs from the receiver, which it has no mechanism to detect or cope with. , algorithms that provide equivalent or better receiver feedback in a more reliable approach are an active research topic.

<doc id="309472" wikidata="Q1314278" url="?curid=309472" title="Woven fabric">
<text>Woven fabric is any textile formed by weaving. Woven fabrics, often created on a loom, are made of many threads woven in a warp and weft. Technically, a woven fabric is any fabric made by interlacing two or more threads at right angles to one another. Woven fabrics can be made of natural fibers, synthetic fibers, or a mixture of both, such as cotton and polyester.
Woven fabrics are used for clothing, garments, decorations, furniture, carpets and other uses.

== Production Process ==
Yarn Preparation: Fibers are spun into yarns and prepared with specific properties tailored for either the warp (longitudinal yarns) or the weft (transverse yarns).

Warping: The warp yarns are arranged on a beam to prepare for weaving. The warp threads are held taut and parallel, and as such must be strong and durable.

Weaving: During weaving, the weft yarn passes over and under the warp yarns in various patterns. The primary types of weaves are plain weave, twill weave, and satin weave. These basic types have been extrapolated into a variety of diverse patterns that serve both form and function.

Finishing: After weaving, the fabric undergoes several finishing processes, which might include bleaching, dyeing, printing, and treatments to enhance performance characteristics like water resistance or shrinkage prevention.

== Qualities ==
Woven fabrics only stretch diagonally on the bias (between the warp and weft directions), unless the threads used are elastic. Woven fabric cloth usually frays at the edges, unless techniques are used to counter it, such as the use of pinking shears or hemming. Different companies use textiles differently to create products.Fabrics that are woven do not stretch as easily as knitted fabrics, which can make them advantageous for many uses.

Closely woven fabric is more durable and keeps it shape better. Woven fabric is constructed with two threads, horizontal and vertical. The horizontal threads are called the weft and the vertical threads are called the warp. The warp and weft can be woven together in different variations of the three basic weaves; plain, twill and satin. These varieties can be shaped into dresses, tops, coats, etc.

<doc id="309475" wikidata="Q336036" url="?curid=309475" title="Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading">
<text>Rufus Daniel Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading (10 October 1860 – 30 December 1935), known as the Earl of Reading from 1917 to 1926, was a British Liberal politician and judge, who served as Lord Chief Justice of England, Viceroy of India, and Foreign Secretary, the last Liberal to hold that post. The second practising Jew to be a member of the British cabinet (the first being Herbert Samuel, who was also a member of H. H. Asquith&#x27;s government), Isaacs was the first Jewish Lord Chief Justice, and the first British Jew to become a marquess.

==Biography==
Rufus Isaacs was born at 3 Bury Street, in the parish of St Mary Axe, London, the son of a Jewish fruit importer at Spitalfields. He was educated at University College School and then entered the family business at the age of 15. In 1876–77 he served as a ship&#x27;s boy and later worked as a jobber on the stock-exchange from 1880 to 1884. In 1887 he married Alice Edith Cohen, who suffered from a chronic physical disability and died of cancer in 1930, after over 40 years of marriage. The Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar is named after her.

He then married Stella Charnaud, the first Lady Reading&#x27;s secretary. His second marriage lasted until his own death in 1935. After his death Stella Isaacs was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1941, promoted to Dame Grand Cross (GBE) in 1944, and then in 1958 made a life peeress as Baroness Swanborough, of Swanborough in the County of Sussex.

== Legal career ==

Isaacs was admitted as a student to the Middle Temple in 1885, and was called to the Bar in 1887. He set up his own chambers at 1 Garden Court, Temple, and was very successful; within five years he was able to repay his creditors, and after twenty years at the bar earned the enormous sum of £30,000 per year. He was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1898, after only ten and half years at the junior bar.

Isaacs mainly practised in the Commercial Court, with occasional appearance in the divorce court or at the Old Bailey. Among his famous cases were the defence of &quot;The Star&quot; against a charge of libel by Arthur Chamberlain (at the behest of his brother Joseph), the Taff Vale case (where he appeared for the union), the 1903 &quot;Bayliss v. Coleridge&quot; libel suit, the prosecution of the fraudster Whitaker Wright, the defence of Sir Edward Russell on a charge of criminal libel, and that of Robert Sievier on a charge of blackmail.

As a barrister, Isaacs was a hard worker, rising early to prepare his cases, although he never worked after dinner. His advocacy was calm and forensic, and he was renowned for his style of cross-examination.

==Political career ==
Having earlier contested unsuccessfully North Kensington in 1900, Isaacs entered the House of Commons as the Liberal Party member of Parliament (MP) for Reading at the by-election on 6 August 1904, a seat he held for nine years until 1913.

In 1910, he was appointed solicitor general in the government of H. H. Asquith and received the customary knighthood. After six months, he was appointed attorney general. On the resignation of Lord Loreburn as Lord Chancellor in 1912, Isaacs had expected to succeed him, but was passed over in favour of Lord Haldane. To appease him, Asquith invited Isaacs to join the Cabinet; he was the first attorney general to sit in the Cabinet.

As law officer, Isaacs handled many high-profile cases. As solicitor general, he appeared for the Admiralty in the George Archer-Shee case. As attorney general, he led the prosecutions of Edward Mylius for criminal libel against King George V (and was appointed KCVO shortly after), of poisoner Frederick Seddon (the only murder trial Isaacs ever took part in), and of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst. He also represented the Board of Trade at the inquiry into the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

In addition, he helped to pilot through the Commons several pieces of key legislation, including the Parliament Act 1911, the Official Secrets Act 1911, the National Insurance Act 1911, the Trade Union Act 1913, and the Government of Ireland Act 1914. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1911 Coronation Honours.

=== Marconi scandal ===
Isaacs was one of several high-ranking members of the Liberal government accused of involvement in the Marconi scandal. An article published in &quot;Le Matin&quot; on 14 February 1913 alleged corruption in the award of a government contract to the Marconi Company and insider trading in Marconi&#x27;s shares, implicating a number of sitting government ministers, including Lloyd George, the chancellor of the Exchequer; Isaacs, then attorney general; Herbert Samuel, postmaster general; and the treasurer of the Liberal Party, Lord Murray.

The allegations included the fact that Isaacs&#x27;s brother, Godfrey Isaacs, was managing director of the Marconi company at the time that the cabinet, in which Isaacs sat, awarded Marconi the contract. Isaacs and Samuels sued &quot;Le Matin&quot; for libel, and as a result, the journal apologised and printed a complete retraction in its 18 February 1913 issue.

The factual matters were at least partly resolved by a parliamentary select committee investigation, which issued three reports: all found that Isaacs and others had purchased shares in the American Marconi company, but while the fellow-Liberal members of the committee cleared the ministers of all blame, the opposition members reported that Isaacs and others had acted with &quot;grave impropriety&quot;. It was not made public during the trial that these shares had been made available through Isaacs&#x27;s brother at a favourable price.

== Diplomatic career ==

In October 1913 he was made Lord Chief Justice of England, in succession to the Viscount Alverstone. At the time the Attorney General had the right of first refusal for the appointment, but his involvement in the Marconi scandal complicated matters. Although reluctant to abandon his political career Isaacs felt he had little choice: to refuse would be to suggest that the Marconi scandal had tainted him. Consequently, he accepted the post, and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Reading, &quot;of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire&quot;, on 9 January 1914. His appointment caused some controversy, and led to Rudyard Kipling attacking him in the poem &quot;Gehazi&quot;.

As Lord Chief Justice, Reading presided over the trial of Roger Casement for high treason. His attendance in court was, however, intermittent, as he was frequently called upon by the government to serve as an advisor. In August 1914 Reading was enlisted to deal with the financial crisis brought about by the outbreak of the First World War. In 1915 he led the Anglo-French Financial Commission to seek financial assistance for the Allies from the United States. During the December 1916 Cabinet crisis, he acted as intermediary between Asquith and David Lloyd George.

In September 1917 Reading returned to the United States with the special appointment of high commissioner to the United States and Canada. In 1918 he was appointed British Ambassador to the United States, all the while remaining Lord Chief Justice. Returning to England for six months in 1918, he frequently attended the War Cabinet and was sent to France as Lloyd George&#x27;s confidential emissary. He returned to the United States as Ambassador in 1919, relinquishing the post the same year. After the excitement of wartime diplomacy, he returned unwillingly to the bench in 1919, while seeking new appointments.

For his wartime public service he was appointed GCB in 1915, made Viscount Reading, &quot;of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire&quot; in 1916, and Earl of Reading as well as Viscount Erleigh, &quot;of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire&quot;, in 1917.

=== Viceroy of India ===

In 1921, he resigned the chief justiceship to become Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Reading preferred a conciliatory policy: he was determined to implement the provisions of the Government of India Act 1919 and opposed racial discrimination. He personally received Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and visited Amritsar as a gesture of reconciliation. However, he ended up using force on several occasions: in 1921 he ordered the suppression of the Malabar rebellion, and in 1922 he put down Sikh unrest in the Punjab. The same year, he had Gandhi arrested for sedition. Reading cultivated good relations with the Indian princes, but forced two maharajas to abdicate.

On his return from India in 1926, he was made Marquess of Reading, the first man to rise from commoner to a marquessate since the Duke of Wellington. The next year he was made Captain of Deal Castle in 1927, a position he held until 1934. As Viceroy Reading was appointed GCSI and GCIE &quot;ex officio&quot; in 1921, and in 1922 was promoted to GCVO.

As a former viceroy, Reading was critical of some of the policies of his successor Lord Irwin. On 5 November 1929 he attacked Irwin in the House of Lords for using the term &quot;Dominion Status&quot; with regard to India, prior to the report of the Simon Commission.

== Later life and career ==
On his return from India, Reading, who had no pension and was a heavy spender, sat on several corporate boards, and later became president of Imperial Chemical Industries. The Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords from 1931 to 1935, he took part in the Round Table Conferences of 1930–32 on the future of British India as head of the Liberal delegates. He was also a member of the select committee charged with the drafting of the Government of India Act 1935.

In MacDonald&#x27;s National Government in August 1931, Reading briefly served as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House of Lords, but stood down after the first major reshuffle in November due to ill-health.

He was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1934.

== Death ==
Reading died in London in December 1935 aged 75. His ashes were buried at the nearby Jewish cemetery. The house where he died, No. 32 Curzon Street in Mayfair, has had a blue plaque on it since 1971.

== Honours and commemoration==
In addition to five peerages and five knighthoods, Reading was appointed Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold in 1925. He was Captain of Deal Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and was a Bencher and Treasurer of the Middle Temple.

The Lord Reading Law Society, founded in 1948 to promote the interests of Jewish members of the Quebec Bar, was named for him. He was a founding chairman of the Palestine Electric Corporation and the Reading Power Station in Tel Aviv, Israel was named for him.

== Political stands ==
Isaacs championed the taxation of land values and reforms in the legal standing of unions, education, licensing, and military organization. Isaacs also gave staunch official backing to David Lloyd George&#x27;s initiative on land reform, together with his tax on land values and national social insurance scheme.

<doc id="309481" wikidata="Q333091" url="?curid=309481" title="John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon">
<text>John Allsebrook Simon, 1st Viscount Simon, (28 February 1873 – 11 January 1954) was a British politician who held senior Cabinet posts from the beginning of the First World War to the end of the Second World War. He is one of three people to have served as Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer, the others being Rab Butler and James Callaghan.

He also served as Lord Chancellor, the most senior position in the British legal system. Beginning his career as a Liberal (identified initially with the left wing but later with the right wing of the party), he joined the National Government in 1931, creating the Liberal National Party in the process. At the end of his career, he was essentially a Conservative.

==Background and education==
Simon was born in a terraced house on Moss Side, Manchester, the eldest child and only son of Edwin Simon (1843–1920) and wife Fanny Allsebrook (1846–1936). His father was a Congregationalist minister, like three of his five brothers, and was pastor of Zion Chapel in Hulme, Manchester. His mother was a farmer&#x27;s daughter and a descendant of Sir Richard Pole and his wife, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury.

Congregational ministers were expected to move about the country. Simon was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Bath, as his father was President of Somerset Congregational Union. He was then a scholar of Fettes College in Edinburgh, where he was Head of School and won many prizes.

He failed to win a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, but won an open scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford. He arrived at Wadham in 1892. He achieved Seconds in Mathematics and Classical Moderations. He spoke in support of Herbert Samuel for South Oxfordshire in the 1895 election and, after two terms as Junior Treasurer, became President of the Oxford Union in Hilary Term 1896, Simon won the Barstow Law Scholarship and graduated with a first in Greats in 1896.

Simon&#x27;s attendance at Wadham overlapped with those of F. E. Smith, the cricketer C. B. Fry and the journalist Francis Hirst. Smith, Fry and Simon played in the Wadham Rugby XV together. Simon and Smith began a rivalry that lasted throughout their legal and political careers over the next 30 years. Simon was, in David Dutton&#x27;s view, a finer scholar than Smith. Although Smith thought Simon pompous, Simon, in the words of a contemporary, thought that Smith excelled at &quot;the cheap score&quot;. A famous (although clearly untrue) malicious story had it that Smith and Simon had tossed a coin to decide which party to join.

Simon was briefly a trainee leader writer for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; under C. P. Scott. Simon shared lodgings with Leo Amery while both were studying for the All Souls Fellowship (both were successful). He became a Fellow of All Souls in 1897.

Simon left Oxford at the end of 1898 and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1899. He was a pupil of A. J. Ram and then of Sir Reginald Acland. Like many barristers, his career got off to a slow start: he earned a mere £27 in his first year at the bar. At first, he earned some extra money by coaching candidates for the bar exams. As a barrister, he relied on logic and reason rather than oratory and histrionics, and he excelled at simplifying complex issues. He was a brilliant advocate of complex cases before judges although rather less so before juries. Some of his work was done on the Western Circuit at Bristol. He worked exceptionally hard, often preparing his cases through the night several times a week. His initial lack of connections made his eventual success at the Bar all the more impressive.

Simon was widowed in 1902 and took solace in his work. He became a successful lawyer, and in 1903, he acted for the British government in the Alaska boundary dispute. Even three years after his wife&#x27;s death, he spent Christmas Day 1905 alone by walking aimlessly in France.

==Early political career==
Simon entered the House of Commons as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Walthamstow at the 1906 general election. In 1908, he became a KC (senior barrister) at the same time as F. E. Smith. Simon annoyed Smith by not telling his rival in advance that he was applying for silk.

In 1909, Simon spoke out strongly in parliament in support of David Lloyd George&#x27;s progressive &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;. He entered the government on 7 October 1910 as solicitor-general, succeeding Rufus Isaacs, and was knighted later that month, as was then usual for government law officers (Asquith brushed aside his objections). At 37, he was the youngest solicitor-general since the 1830s. In February 1911, he successfully prosecuted Edward Mylius for criminal libel for claiming that King George V was a bigamist. As was then required by the law, he fought a by-election after his appointment.

He was honoured with appointment as a KCVO in 1911. Asquith referred to him as &quot;the Impeccable&quot; for his intellectual self-assurance, but after a series of social encounters, he wrote that &quot;The Impeccable&quot; was becoming &quot;The Inevitable&quot;.

Along with Isaacs, Simon represented the Board of Trade at the public inquiry into the sinking of the in 1912; their close questioning of witnesses helped to prepare the way for improved maritime safety measures. Unusually for a government law officer, he was active in partisan political debate. When F. E. Smith first spoke from the Conservative front bench in 1912, Simon was put up next to oppose his old rival. He was promoted on 19 October 1913 to attorney-general, again succeeding Isaacs. Unusually for an attorney-general, he was made a full member of Cabinet, as Isaacs had been, rather than simply being invited to attend when he was required. He was already being tipped as a potential future Liberal prime minister.

He was the leader of the (unsuccessful) cabinet rebels against Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1914 naval estimates. Asquith thought that Simon had organised &quot;a conclave of malcontents&quot; (Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna, Samuel, Charles Hobhouse and Beauchamp). He wrote to Asquith that the &quot;loss of WC, though regrettable, is &quot;not&quot; by any means the splitting of the party&quot;. Lloyd George referred to Simon as &quot;a kind of Robespierre&quot;.

Simon contemplated resigning in protest at the declaration of war in August 1914 but, in the end, changed his mind. He was accused of hypocrisy even though his position was not actually very different from that of Lloyd George. He remained in the Cabinet after Asquith reminded him of his public duty and hinted at promotion. He damaged himself in the eyes of Hobhouse (postmaster-general), Charles Masterman and the journalist C. P. Scott. Roy Jenkins believed that Simon was genuinely opposed to war.

Early in 1915, Asquith rated Simon as &quot;equal seventh&quot; in his score list of the Cabinet, after his &quot;malaise of last autumn&quot;.

==First World War==
On 25 May 1915, Simon became Home Secretary in Asquith&#x27;s new coalition government. He declined an offer of the job of Lord Chancellor, which would have meant going to the Lords and restricting his active political career thereafter. As home secretary, he satisfied nobody. He tried to defend the Union of Democratic Control against Edward Carson&#x27;s attempt to prosecute it. However, he tried to ban &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for criticising the government&#x27;s conduct of the war but failed to obtain Cabinet support.

He resigned in January 1916 in protest against the introduction of conscription of single men, which he thought a breach of Liberal principles. McKenna and Walter Runciman also opposed conscription but for different reasons: they thought that it would weaken British industry and wanted Britain to concentrate her war effort on the Royal Navy and supporting the other Allies with finance. In his memoirs, Simon would admit that his resignation from the Home Office had been a mistake.

In August 1916, Simon became chairman of the Royal Commission on the Arrest... and Subsequent Treatment of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, Thomas Dickson and Patrick James McIntyre. The Commission published its report in September but without the evidential proceedings.

After Asquith&#x27;s fall in December 1916, Simon remained in opposition as an Asquithian Liberal.

Simon proved his patriotism by serving as an officer on Trenchard&#x27;s staff in the Royal Flying Corps for about a year, starting in the summer of 1917. His duties included purchasing supplies in Paris, where he married his second wife towards the end of 1917. Amidst questions as to whether it was appropriate for a serving officer to do so, Simon spoke in Trenchard&#x27;s defence in Parliament when Trenchard resigned as Chief of Air Staff after Trenchard had fallen out with the President of the Air Council Lord Rothermere, who soon resigned. However, Simon was attacked in the Northcliffe Press (Northcliffe was Rothermere&#x27;s brother).

Simon&#x27;s Walthamstow constituency was split up at the &quot;Coupon Election&quot; in 1918 and he was defeated at the new Walthamstow East division by a margin of more than 4,000 votes.

==1920s==
===Out of Parliament===
In 1919, he attempted to return to Parliament at the Spen Valley by-election. Lloyd George put up a coalition Liberal candidate in Spen Valley to keep Simon out and was active behind the scenes trying to see him defeated.

Although the Coalition Liberals, who had formerly held the seat, were pushed into third place, Simon came second; in the view of Maurice Cowling (&quot;The Impact of Labour 1920-4&quot;), his defeat by Labour marked the point at which Labour began to be seen as a serious threat by the older political parties.

===Deputy leader of Liberals===
In the early 1920s, he practised successfully at the bar before being elected for Spen Valley at the general election in 1922, and from 1922 to 1924, he served as deputy leader of the Liberal Party (under Asquith). In the early 1920s, he spoke in the House of Commons about socialism, the League of Nations, unemployment and Ireland. He may well have hoped to succeed Asquith as Liberal leader. He retired temporarily from the Bar around then.

In October 1924, Simon moved the amendment that brought down the first Labour government. At that year&#x27;s general election, the Conservatives were returned to power, and the Liberals were reduced to a rump of just over 40 MPs. Although Asquith, who had lost his seat, remained leader of the party, Lloyd George was elected chairman of the Liberal MPs by 29 votes to 9. Simon abstained in the vote. By this time he was increasingly anti-socialist and quite friendly to the Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin and clashed increasingly with Lloyd George. He stood down as deputy leader and returned to the Bar.

===General strike and Simon Commission===
Unlike Lloyd George, Simon opposed the 1926 general strike. On 6 May, the fourth day of the strike, he declared in the House of Commons that the strike was illegal and argued that it was not entitled to the legal privileges of the Trade Disputes Act 1906 and that the union bosses would be &quot;liable to the utmost farthing&quot; in damages for the harm that they inflicted on businesses and for inciting the men to break their contracts of employment. Simon was highly respected as an authority on the law but was neither popular nor seen as a political leader. Trade Union historian Henry Pelling comments that Simon&#x27;s speech was clearly intended to intimidate, but had little effect. A few days later he was answered by Labour’s Sir Henry Slesser, who argued that a strike was only illegal if it could be proven to be a seditious conspiracy against the state. Pelling believes that Slesser was right as sympathetic strikes were not explicitly made illegal until the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927.

Simon was then one of the highest-paid barristers of his generation and was believed to earn between £36,000 and £70,000 per annum (). It seemed for a while that he might abandon politics altogether. Simon spoke for the Dominion of Newfoundland in the Labrador boundary dispute with Canada before he announced his permanent retirement from the Bar.

From 1927 to 1931, he chaired the Indian Constitutional Development Committee or the Indian Statutory Commission, known as the Simon Commission, on the constitution of India.

Upon the commission&#x27;s arrival in Bombay in February 1928, it was immediately met with a hartal and protestors holding black flags and banners reading &quot;Simon Go Back&quot; (coined by Yusuf Meherally) involving prominent Indian political leaders such as Lala Lajpat Rai and Tanguturi Prakasam. The protests erupted due to the lack of Indian representation on the commission, with the group composed of seven all-British Members of Parliament.

His personality was already something of an issue: Neville Chamberlain wrote of him to the Viceroy of India Lord Irwin (12 August 1928): &quot;I am always trying to like him, and believing I shall succeed when something crops up to put me off&quot;. Dutton describes Simon&#x27;s eventual report as a &quot;lucid exposition of the problems of the subcontinent in all their complexity&quot;. However, Simon had been hampered by the inquiry&#x27;s terms of reference (no Indians had been included on the committee), and his conclusions were overshadowed by the Irwin Declaration of October 1929, which Simon opposed, which promised India eventual dominion status. Simon was appointed GCSI 1930.

===Liberal National split and moving towards Conservatives===
Before serving on the committee, Simon had obtained a guarantee that he would not be opposed by a Conservative candidate at Spen Valley at the 1929 general election, and, indeed he was never again opposed by a Conservative. During the late 1920s and especially during the 1929-31 Parliament, in which Labour had no majority but continued in office with the help of the Liberals, Simon was seen as the leader of the minority of Liberal MPs who disliked Lloyd George&#x27;s inclination to support Labour, rather than the Conservatives. Simon still supported free trade during the 1929-31 Parliament.

In 1930, Simon headed the official inquiry into the R101 airship disaster.

In June 1931, before the formation of the National Government, Simon resigned the Liberal whip. In September, Simon and his 30-or-so followers became the Liberal Nationals (later renamed the &quot;National Liberals&quot;) and increasingly aligned themselves with the Conservatives for practical purposes. Simon was accused by Lloyd George of leaving &quot;the slime of hypocrisy&quot; as he crossed the floor (on another occasion, Lloyd George is said to have commented that he had &quot;sat on the fence so long the iron has entered into his soul&quot;, but this quote is more difficult to verify).

==1930s: National Government==
===Foreign Secretary===
Simon was not initially included in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s National Government, which was formed in August 1931. Simon offered to give up his seat at Spen Valley to MacDonald if the latter had trouble holding Seaham (MacDonald held the seat in 1931 but lost it in 1935). On 5 November 1931, Simon was appointed Foreign Secretary when the National Government was reconstituted. The appointment was at first greeted with acclaim. Simon&#x27;s Liberal Nationals continued to support protectionism and Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s National Government after the departure of the mainstream Liberals, led by Herbert Samuel, who left the government in 1932 and formally went into Opposition in November 1933.

Simon&#x27;s tenure of office saw a number of important events in foreign policy, including the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, which had begun in September 1931, before he had taken office. Simon attracted particular opprobrium for his speech to the General Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva on 7 December 1932 in which he failed to denounce Japan unequivocally. Thereafter, Simon was known as the &quot;Man of Manchukuo&quot; and was compared unfavourably to the young Anthony Eden, who was popular at Geneva. Simon was excellent in offering up an analysis of a problem in which he would lay out the advantages and disadvantages of each option, but he had much difficulty in choosing which to select, much to the vexation of Eden who complained &quot;he expects the Cabinet to find his policy for him-Poor Simon is no fighter. Nothing will make him into one&quot;. Simon&#x27;s inability to choose an option reflected his background as a lawyer where he would lay out all the possible options for his client, who would then choose which option to pursue.

The British historian David Dutton wrote that some of the attacks on Simon&#x27;s handling of the Japanese conquest of Manchuria were not fair in the sense that everything is put down to Simon&#x27;s supposed personal weaknesses rather than to the so-called Ten Year Rule instituted in 1919 by the War Secretary Winston Churchill which stated that British defence spending was to be based on the assumption that there would be no major war in the next ten years. As a result of the Ten Year Rule, Britain did not have sufficient military forces to face Japan, most notably as the naval base at Singapore, begun in 1921, was still under construction. Simon&#x27;s tendency to equivocate with regard to Manchuria and his suggestions that more research was needed to establish whether Japan had committed aggression or not was a way of covering up the fact that Britain was not capable of fighting a major war in 1931. In particular, Simon&#x27;s equivocating was to cover up the fact that the much vaulted Singapore strategy was a sham as the Singapore naval base would not be finished until 1938. Moreover, although the League of Nations&#x27; collective security doctrine should had required the other members of the League to respond to an act of aggression against China, there was little support in Britain in 1931 for going to war against Japan for the sake of a Chinese province of whose existence many people only learned when Japan seized it. Adding to the charge against Simon was the claim that the administration of Herbert Hoover wanted to have the United States act against Japan and that Simon spurred the American offer. The historian A. L. Rowse, who belonged to the &quot;guilty men&quot; school of historiography and who tended to be very harsh in his writings towards Simon, conceded that this claim that Simon rejected American offers in 1931-1932 to take joint action against Japan was a myth, apparently invented by American historians to explain why the United States was not more forceful in responding to Japan&#x27;s aggression.

However, it is true that in January 1932 Simon rejected an offer by the American Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson calling for a joint Anglo-American declaration stating that they would never establish diplomatic relations with the sham state of Manchukuo, which was viewed in Japan as a pro-Japanese gesture that reflected a quiet sympathy for Japan&#x27;s actions. Japanese diplomats and generals believed that Britain could be persuaded to accept Manchukuo in exchange for a promise that Japan would support Britain in upholding its extraterritorial rights in China, and that there was no prospect of any British action against Japan as long as Simon remained Foreign Secretary. Japanese diplomats viewed Labour and the Liberals as the &quot;anti-Japanese&quot; parties committed to the League of Nations while the Conservatives were viewed as the &quot;pro-Japanese&quot; imperialist party committed to &quot;realpolitik&quot; in upholding the British empire in Asia. Though Simon was a Liberal, he was felt in Japan to be closer to the Conservatives in his views. The repeated demands by the Chinese for the abolition of all the extraterritorial rights in China held by foreign powers gained via the so-called &quot;unequal treaties&quot; in the 19th century was felt in Japan to be the basis of a common Anglo-Japanese front against China that would ultimately lead to Britain recognising Manchukuo.

At the same time, Adolf Hitler was coming to power in Germany in January 1933. Hitler immediately withdrew Germany from the League of Nations and announced a programme of rearmament, initially to give Germany armed forces commensurate with France and other powers. Simon did not foresee the sheer scale of Hitler&#x27;s ambitions, but Dutton pointed out, the same was then true for many others.

Simon&#x27;s term of office also saw the failure of the World Disarmament Conference (1932-1934). His contribution was not entirely in vain since he proposed qualitative (seeking to limit or ban certain types of weapon), rather than quantitative (simple numbers of weapons), disarmament.

Simon does not appear to have been considered for the post of Chancellor of Oxford University in succession to Viscount Grey in 1933 since Simon was then at the depth of his unpopularity as Foreign Secretary. Lord Irwin was elected, and since he lived until 1959, the job did not fall vacant again in Simon&#x27;s lifetime.

There was talk of Neville Chamberlain, who dominated the government&#x27;s domestic policy, becoming Foreign Secretary, but that would have been intolerable to MacDonald, who took a keen interest in foreign affairs and wanted a leading non-Conservative in that role. In 1933 and late 1934, Simon was being criticised by both Austen and Neville Chamberlain as well as by Eden, Lloyd George, Nancy Astor, David Margesson, Vincent Massey, Runciman, Jan Smuts and Churchill. In March 1935, Simon visited Berlin to meet Adolf Hitler at the Reich Chancellery. Just before departing, Simon told King George V that he believed the repudiation of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles (the section of the treaty dealing with the military disarmament of Germany) was the beginning, and that he felt likely that Hitler also wanted the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, the repudiation of Part VI of the Treaty of Versailles (the section dealing with the naval disarmament of Germany) along with the return of the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk), Memel (modern Klaipėda), and the former German colonies in Africa. Simon reported after his meeting in the Reich Chancellery that Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy was &quot;very dangerous for the peace of Europe&quot; and the results might be &quot;terrible beyond conception&quot;. However, Simon stated that thinking along these lines was &quot;pretty hopeless&quot; and resolved to keep to press for Germany to return to the World Disarmament Conference, which had abjured in 1934, and the League of Nations. Because the rules of the League of Nations forbade member nations from attacking each other, Simon attached enormous symbolic significance to a German return to the League as a symbol of Germany&#x27;s willingness to be a responsible member of the international system.

Simon accompanied MacDonald to negotiate the Stresa Front with France and Italy in April 1935, but it was MacDonald who took the lead in the negotiations. Simon himself did not think that Stresa would stop German rearmament – indeed, he told the House of Commons in 1934 that Germany&#x27;s rearmament was &quot;vital to peace&quot; – but thought that it might be a useful deterrent against territorial aggression by Hitler. The first stirrings of Italian aggression towards Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) were also then seen. During Simon&#x27;s tenure of the Foreign Office, British defence strength was at its lowest point of the interwar period, which severely limited his freedom of action.

Even Simon&#x27;s colleagues thought that he had been a disastrous Foreign Secretary, &quot;the worst since Æthelred the Unready&quot;, as one wag put it. He was better at analysing a problem than at concluding and acting. Jenkins commented that he was a bad Foreign Secretary in the view of his contemporaries and ever since and concurs that he was better at analysing than solving. Neville Chamberlain thought he always sounded as though he was speaking from a brief. Simon&#x27;s officials despaired of him since he had few thoughts of his own, solutions were imposed on him by others and he defended them only weakly. Leo Amery was a rare defender of Simon&#x27;s record: in 1937, he recorded that Simon &quot;really had been a sound foreign minister – and Stresa marked the nearest Europe has been to peace since 1914&quot;.

===Home Secretary===
Simon served as Home Secretary (in Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s Third Government) from 7 June 1935 to 28 May 1937. That position was in Dutton&#x27;s view better suited to his abilities than the Foreign Office. He also became Deputy Leader of the House of Commons on the understanding that the latter position would be given to Neville Chamberlain after the election (in the event, it was not). In 1935, Simon was the last Home Secretary to attend a royal birth (of the present Duke of Kent).

==== The Battle of Cable Street ====
In 1936 – despite pressure from the former Labour leader and MP George Lansbury, as well as from mayors of five East London Boroughs (Hackney, Shoreditch, Stepney, Bethnal Green and Poplar) and a 100,000 signature-strong petition from local East Londoners (organised by the Jewish People&#x27;s Council) – the then-home secretary Simon refused to ban a march organised by the British Union of Fascists (BUF) through the then predominantly Jewish East End of London. The BUF&#x27;s announcement of this large-scale march was widely regarded &quot;an act of provocation (...) aimed at (...) Jews and Communists&quot;. The ensuing events have since become known as the Battle of Cable Street.

Two days after the event, the Labour Party Annual Conference denounced Sir John Simon for not banning the march and articulated a need for legislation. While the ensuing Public Order Act (1936) did successfully restrict politically extremist movements, it was nevertheless criticised for handing significant powers to the police to determine the routes of marches and processions. The Public Order act&#x27;s legacy remains mixed and its authorship is contested, but records show that Simon did commend the bill to the house.

Other issues

Simon also played a key role behind the scenes in the 1936 Abdication Crisis. In 2013 it was revealed that he was so worried about the behaviour of King Edward VIII that he ordered the bugging of his telephone line.

He was one of the signatories to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. He also introduced the Factories Act 1937.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
====Peace====
In 1937, Neville Chamberlain succeeded Baldwin as prime minister. Simon succeeded Chamberlain as Chancellor of the Exchequer and was raised to GCVO in 1937. As Chancellor, he tried to keep arms spending as low as possible in the belief that a strong economy was the &quot;fourth arm of defence&quot;. In 1937, he presented a finance bill that was based on the budget that Chamberlain had drawn up before being promoted.

In 1938, public expenditure passed the previously unthinkable level of £1,000m for the first time. In the spring 1938 budget, Simon raised the income tax from 5s to 5s 6d and increased duties on tea and petrol.

Simon had become a close political ally of Chamberlain and flattered him a great deal. In the autumn of 1938, he led the Cabinet to Heston Airport to wish him God speed on his flight to meet Hitler, and he helped to persuade Chamberlain to make the &quot;high&quot; case for Munich: that he had achieved a lasting peace, rather than that he had only limited potential damage. He retained the support of Chamberlain until around the middle of 1939.

In the spring 1939 budget, income tax was unchanged, and the surtax was increased, as were indirect taxes on cars, sugar and tobacco. It was not a war budget even though Hitler had already broken the Munich Accords by occupying Prague.

====War====
On 2 September 1939, Simon led a deputation of ministers to see Chamberlain to insist for Britain to honour her guarantee to Poland and go to war if Hitler did not withdraw. Simon became a member of the small War Cabinet.

On the outbreak of war, sterling was devalued, with very little attention, from $4.89 to $4.03. At the emergency budget of September 1939, public expenditure had passed £2,000m; income tax was increased from 5s 6d (27.5%) to 7s 6d (37.5%); duties on alcohol, petrol and sugar were hiked; and a 60% tax on excess profits was introduced.

Simon&#x27;s political position weakened as he came to be seen as a symbol of foot-dragging and the lack of commitment to total war. Along with Labour&#x27;s dislike of Chamberlain, he was used as an excuse by the opposition parties for not joining the government on the outbreak of war. Archibald Sinclair, the leader of the &quot;official&quot; Liberal Party, said that for over seven years, Simon had been &quot;the evil genius of British foreign policy&quot;. Hugh Dalton and Clement Attlee were very critical of Simon, as were many government backbenchers.

Chamberlain privately told colleagues that he found Simon &quot;very much deteriorated&quot;. Simon&#x27;s position weakened after Churchill rejoined the Cabinet on the outbreak of war and got on surprisingly well with Chamberlain, who toyed with the idea of replacing Simon with former Chancellor Reginald McKenna (then aged 76) or Lord Stamp, the chairman of the LMS Railway who had a secret meeting at Downing Street about the position. Even Captain Margesson, the Chief Whip, fancied his chances for the position.

Simon&#x27;s last budget, in April 1940, saw public spending pass £2,700m, 46% of which was paid for from taxation and the rest from borrowing. Simon&#x27;s April 1940 budget kept income tax at 7s 6d; a &quot;Punch&quot; cartoon expressed a widely-held view that it should have been increased to 10s (50%). Tax allowances were increased. Postal charges were increased, as were charges on tobacco, matches and alcohol. The purchase tax, an ancestor of today&#x27;s value-added tax (VAT), was introduced.

In April 1940, he rejected John Maynard Keynes&#x27; idea of a forced loan, a tax disguised as a compulsory purchase of government securities. Keynes wrote a coruscating letter of rebuke to &quot;The Times&quot;. Simon found himself criticised, from opposite ends of the spectrum, by Leo Amery and Aneurin Bevan.

==Lord Chancellor==
In May 1940, following the Norway Debate, Simon urged Chamberlain to stand firm as Prime Minister although Simon offered to resign and take Samuel Hoare with him. By 1940, Simon, along with his successor as Foreign Secretary, Hoare, had come to be seen as one of the &quot;Guilty Men&quot; responsible for appeasement of the dictators, and like Hoare, Simon was not regarded as acceptable in the War Cabinet of Churchill&#x27;s new coalition. Hugh Dalton thought Simon &quot;the snakiest of the lot&quot;.

Simon became Lord Chancellor in Churchill&#x27;s government but without a place on the War Cabinet. Attlee commented that he &quot;will be quite innocuous&quot; in the role. On 13 May 1940, he was created Viscount Simon, of Stackpole Elidor in the County of Pembroke, a village from which his father traced descent.

In Dutton&#x27;s view, of all the senior positions which he held, that was the one for which he was most suited. As Lord Chancellor, he delivered important judgements on the damages due for death caused by negligence and on how the judge ought to direct the jury in a murder trial if a possible defence of manslaughter arose. In 1943 alone, he delivered 43 major judgements on complex cases. RVF Heuston (&quot;Lives of the Lord Chancellors&quot;) described him as a &quot;superb&quot; Lord Chancellor. Jenkins comments that it is even more impressive in that many senior judges had over 20 years&#x27; experience at that level, whereas Simon had been retired from the law since 1928.

Simon interrogated Rudolf Hess, who had flown to Scotland, and also chaired the Royal Commission on the Birthrate.

In May 1945, after the end of the wartime coalition, Simon continued as Lord Chancellor but was not included in the Cabinet of the short-lived Churchill caretaker ministry. After Churchill&#x27;s defeat in the 1945 general election, Simon never held office again.

==Later life==
Although he had won plaudits for his legal skills as Lord Chancellor, Clement Attlee declined to appoint him to the British delegation at the Nuremberg War Trials and told him bluntly in a letter that Simon&#x27;s role in the prewar governments made it unwise. Simon remained active in the House of Lords and as a senior judge on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He wrote a well-regarded practitioners&#x27; text &quot;Simon on Income Tax&quot; in 1948. During the drafting of the Criminal Justice Act 1948, it was Simon who proposed the eventual insertion of the abolition of the privilege of peerage for criminal courts.

In 1948, Simon succeeded Lord Sankey as High Steward of Oxford University. The position is often held by a distinguished Oxonian lawyer. Relations with his nearly-alcoholic wife were somewhat strained, and he increasingly spent his weekends at All Souls, of which he was Senior Fellow.

Simon was a vigorous campaigner against socialism, across the country in the general elections of 1945, 1950 and 1951. Churchill blocked Simon, who had stepped down as leader of the National Liberals in 1940, from joining the Conservative Party. Churchill was keen to lend Conservative support to the (official) Liberals, including his old friend Lady Violet Bonham Carter, but blocked a full merger between the Conservatives and the National Liberals although a constituency-level merger was negotiated with the Conservative Party chairman Lord Woolton in 1947 (thereafter, the National Liberals were increasingly absorbed into the Conservatives for practical purposes until they fully merged in 1968).

Although Simon was still physically and mentally vigorous (aged 78) when the Conservatives returned to power in 1951, Churchill offered him neither a return to the Woolsack nor any other office. In 1952, Simon published his memoirs, &quot;Retrospect&quot;. The quote &quot;I so very tire of politics. The early death of too many a great man is attributed to her touch&quot; is from Simon&#x27;s memoir. Harold Nicolson reviewed the book as describing the &quot;nectarines and peaches of office&quot; as if they were &quot;a bag of prunes&quot;.

Simon died from a stroke on 11 January 1954. He was an atheist and was cremated in his Oxford robes. His estate was valued for probate at £93,006 12s (). Despite his huge earnings at the Bar, he was not particularly greedy for money and was generous to All Souls, to junior barristers and to the children of friends. His personal papers are preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

==Private life and personality==

Simon married Ethel Mary Venables, a niece of the historian J. R. Green, on 24 May 1899 in Headington, Oxfordshire. They had three children: Margaret (born 1900, who later married Geoffrey Edwards), Joan (born 1901, who later married John Bickford-Smith) and John Gilbert, 2nd Viscount Simon (1902–1993). Ethel died soon after the birth of their son Gilbert, in September 1902.

There are some suggestions that his first wife&#x27;s death may have been caused by misguided use of homeopathic medicines, which added to Simon&#x27;s guilt. In Jenkins&#x27; view, widowerhood, although common for politicians of the era, may have affected Simon&#x27;s cold personality. He later apparently tried to persuade Margaret Greville, the hostess of Polesden Lacey, to marry him. Greville later claimed that he had told her that he would marry the next woman he met.

In 1917, in Paris, Simon married the abolition activist Kathleen Manning (1863/64–1955), a widow with one adult son, who had for a while been governess to his children. Her social gaucheness and inability to play the part of a great lady caused embarrassment on the Simon Commission in the late 1920s, and Neville Chamberlain found her &quot;a sore trial&quot;. She had increasing health problems and &quot;dr[ank] to excess&quot; as she grew older. Jenkins wrote that she was tactless and, by the late 1930s, had become a virtual alcoholic but that Simon treated her with &quot;tolerance and kindness&quot;. In 1938, Simon stepped down at Spen Valley and was selected as candidate for Great Yarmouth since he needed a seat nearer London for the sake of his wife&#x27;s health (in the event, he never stood for his new seat but remained MP for Spen Valley until his elevation to the Lords in 1940).

Simon bought Fritwell Manor in Oxfordshire, in 1911 and lived there until 1933. He was an avid chess player and frequently sought for as a dignitary to open major chess tournaments in England.

Simon was neither liked nor trusted, and he was never seriously considered for prime minister. He possessed an unfortunately chilly manner, and from at least 1914 onwards, he had difficulty in conveying an impression that he was acting from honourable motives. His awkward attempts to strike up friendships with his colleagues (asking his Cabinet colleagues to call him &quot;Jack&quot;: only J. H. Thomas did so, and Neville Chamberlain settled on &quot;John&quot;) often fell flat. Jenkins likens him to the nursery rhyme character Dr Fell. In the 1930s, his reputation sank particularly low. Although Simon&#x27;s athletic build and good looks were remarked on even into his old age, the cartoonist David Low portrayed him with, in Low&#x27;s own words, a &quot;sinuous writhing body&quot; to reflect his &quot;disposition to subtle compromise&quot;. Harold Nicolson, after Simon had grabbed his arm from behind to talk to him (19 October 1944), wrote pithily &quot;God what a toad and a worm Simon is!&quot; Another anecdote, from the late 1940s, tells how the socialist intellectual G. D. H. Cole got into a third-class compartment on the train back from Oxford to London to break off conversation with Simon; to his dismay, Simon followed suit, only for both men to produce first-class tickets when the inspector did his rounds.

Simon was devoted to his mother and wrote a well-received &quot;Portrait of My Mother&quot; in 1936 after her death.

<text>Chatelherault Country Park is a country park in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is located in the village of Ferniegair, from Hamilton town centre. On the west side of the park, runs the Avon, a tributary of the River Clyde. 

Its name is derived from the French town of Châtellerault, the title Duc de Châtellerault having been granted to James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran in 1548 for his part in arranging the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to Francis, Dauphin of France.

== History ==
The ancient kings of Strathclyde owned a hunting lodge and royal palace in the woodlands near &quot;Cadzow&quot;, the old name for Hamilton. A Bronze Age burial site was found in the forest, with an urn and the body of a woman having been undisturbed for up to 3000 years. It is possible that during the early medieval age, this land was the power centre of the lost kingdom of &quot;Goddau&quot;, which is mentioned in Old Welsh poetry from the 6th century. Queen &quot;Langoureth&quot; of Strathclyde is said to be the first and last ruler of this kingdom, before it was likely reincorporated back into Strathclyde.

After Strathclyde ceased to be independent in the 11th century, the hunting lodge and palace came under Scottish control, and at some point the site became Cadzow Castle. 

The country park is centred on the former hunting lodge, a folly designed to be seen from the now demolished Hamilton Palace at the end of a broad grass slope forming an avenue with lines of lime trees. The lodge was designed by William Adam and completed in 1734. It comprises two buildings, linked by a gateway, in the form of four pavilions above a garden wall. The north facade was visible from the palace and forms the front of the building. To the rear are formal parterre gardens. The buildings provided kennels, stables and accommodation for hunting parties returning from the woodlands to the south. Adam jokingly referred to his creation as &#x27;The Dogg Kennel&#x27;.

From 1591, Hamilton Palace became the main residence of the Dukes of Hamilton. Rebuilding as the largest country house in Scotland with an imposing Palladian south front began in 1684, then from 1822 Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton had the palace considerably enlarged as a setting for a major art collection, with the north front designed by David Hamilton. Due to debts the art collection was sold in 1882, and the family moved out. In 1889 the 12th Duke leased out coal mining under the Low Parks, and further leasing in 1915 extended the mines under the house itself, causing subsidence to the palace which was sold for demolition in 1921. The ground in front of the lodge was excavated for sand quarrying. The resulting subsidence has created a noticeably lopsided feel in the lodge: coins will roll across the floor, and many visitors report feeling unbalanced and ill. The quarrying was halted in the 1970s, following the death of the 14th Duke. The High and Low parks of Hamilton were given to the nation in lieu of death duties. Historic Scotland began renovating the lodge in the late 1970s, including the fine Georgian plasterwork, and a visitor centre was built to the rear. The lodge and park were opened to the public in 1987 and are now managed by South Lanarkshire Council.

The ruins of Cadzow Castle lie above the gorge of the Avon Water, which runs to the west of the lodge. The bulk of the park lies along the Avon gorge, with woodland walks and cycle routes. A herd of Cadzow cattle live in the fields overlooked by the hunting lodge. This apparently unique breed have white coats and long horns.

In December 2005, access to Chatelherault Country Park was improved with the opening of Chatelherault railway station near to the entrance of the park. This provides two trains from Glasgow (via Hamilton) per hour.

From July 2017 a programme commenced to remove a large area of non-native conifers from the area around the hunting lodge opening views onto the Duke’s Bridge, Cadzow Castle and the Avon Gorge.

<doc id="309485" wikidata="Q7280805" url="?curid=309485" title="Radio Free Virgin">
<text>Radio Free Virgin was a digital radio broadcaster started in early 1999 and a member company of the Virgin Group. Their programming consisted of over 60 professionally programmed channels playing various genres of music. It quickly gained popularity and its downloadable radio player reached the 1 million downloads within a few months in early 2000. The company was privately held corporation funded by Richard Branson and was a unit of Virgin Audio Holdings, LLC. It was headed by Zack Zalon and Brendon Cassidy who were early pioneers in the internet music business. Dave Gordon was an early webmaster for the fledgling group.

While initially a completely free service, programming was ultimately broadcast over the Internet in a two-tier setup: a free tier that allowed access to a subset of channels and a monthly-subscription tier (&quot;RFV Royal&quot;) for paying customers with higher-quality streaming audio and access to a greater number of channels. By March 2003, Radio Free Virgin servers accommodated 2.8 million unique listeners per month and Virgin was offering an integrated digital download and subscription service that was in direct competition with iTunes, Napster and Rhapsody called Virgin Digital. Radio Free Virgin (RFV) was also available at the time via the Philips Streamium device, delivering its channels in MP3Pro.

As of February 2007, the service ceased to operate. It ended with the following cryptic message posted to its homepage:
&quot;Letter from the road - January 3rd, 2007: Dear loyal listener... This marks the 44th blog posting from my trip. It&#x27;s been particularly cold on this leg of the journey. I guess that&#x27;s what you get for hitchhiking Alaska this time of year. I&#x27;ve been calling the office for almost two weeks straight, but no answer. I&#x27;m starting to think that they sent me up here on a ruse of some sort. Like maybe if they got me out of the office on my first vacation in 7 years they&#x27;d have a chance to actually have some fun or something. I&#x27;m pretty damn sure I heard Antoinette say something about St. John, but that could have just been the voices again. I spent about fifteen miles with a group of hippies last night. I mean real hippies, not the kind that don&#x27;t shower and eat raw corn all the time. Bona-fide hippies. Got tuned-out and turned-on in &#x27;68 or something and never looked back. Main girl is called Ragina (nasty) and thinks it&#x27;s 1970. Literally. Keeps bitching about Nixon and how the commies are going to save the world. Still, I may be in love with her. I have my reasons. My thoughts run to the office again - seventy-one of us, all crammed in that little space. Angeline (my driver) with that floppy mane of hair and sarcastic attitude that can only come from an upbringing in rural Wales, Sophie (chef) and her Sonoma foie-gras compote topped Roti A La Broche and constant humming out-of-tune, Vanity (really her name, types up my dictation when Delissa is at lunch) plucking her brows. I miss them all. But I know that being on the road is important for me, too. That the journey is the journey and not the destination, or however the saying goes. That time spent away from the office will make me healthier and the company right along with it. Still, I&#x27;m concerned that nobody&#x27;s answering the phones...&quot;

<text>A button is a fastener that joins two pieces of fabric together by slipping through a loop or by sliding through a buttonhole.

In modern clothing and fashion design, buttons are commonly made of plastic but also may be made of metal, wood, or seashell. Buttons can also be used on containers such as wallets and bags. Buttons may be sewn onto garments and similar items exclusively for purposes of ornamentation. In the applied arts and craft, a button can be an example of folk art, studio craft, or even a miniature work of art. In archaeology, a button can be a significant artifact.

==History==

Buttons and button-like objects used as ornaments or seals rather than fasteners have been discovered in the Indus Valley civilization during its Kot Diji phase (c. 2800–2600 BC). Buttons as apparel have been found at sites of the Catacomb culture, Russia (2500-1950 BC), at the Tomb of the Eagles, Scotland (2200–1800 BC), and at Bronze Age sites in China (c. 2000–1500 BC) and Ancient Rome.

Buttons made from seashell were used by the Indus Valley Civilization for ornamental purposes by 2000 BC. Some buttons were carved into geometric shapes and were pierced so that they could be attached to clothing with thread. Ian McNeil (1990) holds that &quot;the button was originally used more as an ornament than as a fastening, the earliest known being found at Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley. It is made of a curved shell and is about 5000 years old.&quot;

Egypt&#x27;s Eighteenth Dynasty left behind ornate wig covers, fabricated through sewing buttons formed of precious metals onto strips of backing material.

Leatherwork from the Roman Empire incorporates some of the first buttonholes, with the legionary&#x27;s &quot;loculus&quot; closed through the insertion of a metallic buckle, or button into a leather slit. A similar mechanism would later feature in early medieval footwear.
Buttons appeared as a means to close cuffs in the Byzantine Empire and to fasten the necks of Egyptian tunics by no later than the 5th century.

===Middle Ages===
It has been proposed that the European Crusaders brought the innovation of the buttonhole back from the Middle East, allowing for more fitted garments for men. About this time, the Vikings were also using buttons, which they had come across through their trading partners. Prior to the introduction of the buttonhole, two pieces of fabric were butted together, rather than overlapped, and toggles, belts, or lacings were used. The growing importance of buttons was marked by the establishment of button making guilds in the 13th century. Initially, King Louis IX of France included button makers in the established rosary makers guild, but later regulations categorized button makers in three categories: those who worked in horn, bone, and ivory, those who used metals, and makers who used precious metals and glass.

===Rensaissance===
The fitted fashions of the Renaissance required buttons to achieve their shape. For example, the tight-fitting jacket known as the doublet required rows of many buttons. An additional opportunity to use buttons came with the incorporatinon of detachable sleeves into garments. This practice had been in use in Florence since the 1200s. Sleeves could be switched out to be washed or to be replaced by fancier sleeves demanded by particular settings. Women&#x27;s fashion that this time still used lacings, and thus buttons on their clothing were generally decorative.

Buttons were also impacted by the elegant culture of the Renaissance courts. They were no longer seen as simply utilitarian objects, but rather as luxury items that could reflect wealth and status. These buttons, some of which were made of precious metal encrusted with jewels, be seen as jewelry. Because their owners might want to move these valuable buttons from one piece of clothing to another, they often were not sewn on with thread. Rather, their shanks were pushed through the fabric and were held in place with metal strips inserted through the shank. At the time, wood, bone, brass and pewter made it possible for less expensive buttons to be produced.

=== 17th Century ===

Fabric-covered buttons and embroidered buttons because popular in Europe in the 17th century. These were often small, and served a decorative, rather than functional, purpose. The early 17th century short jerkin, wide breeches and cloak may have been adorned by dozens of buttons, and with so many, they needed to be lightweight. The mid century French-originated knee-length coat, the justaucorps, had buttons from the neck to the knee, buttoned sleeve cuffs, and buttoned flaps on the pockets. 

French law, concerned with protecting the silk industry in Paris and Lyons, required buttons to be covered in silk. On the other hand, England did not allow fabric buttons in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Tailors could make fabric-covered buttons with leftover fabric, which threatened the guild of button makers. 

===As containers===
Since at least the seventeenth century, when box-like metal buttons were constructed especially for the purpose, buttons have been one of the items in which drug smugglers have attempted to hide and transport illegal substances. At least one modern smuggler has tried to use this method.

Also making use of the storage possibilities of metal buttons, during the World Wars, British and U.S. military locket buttons were made, containing miniature working compasses.

==Materials and manufacture==

Because buttons have been manufactured from almost every possible material, both natural and synthetic, and combinations of both, the history of the material composition of buttons reflects the timeline of materials technology.

Buttons can be individually crafted by artisans, craftspeople or artists from raw materials or found objects (for example fossils), or a combination of both. Alternatively, they can be the product of low-tech cottage industry or be mass-produced in high-tech factories. Buttons made by artists are art objects, known to button collectors as &quot;studio buttons&quot; (or simply &quot;studios&quot;, from studio craft).

In 1918, the US government made an extensive survey of the international button market, which listed buttons made of vegetable ivory, metal, glass, galalith, silk, linen, cotton-covered crochet, lead, snap fasteners, enamel, rubber, buckhorn, wood, horn, bone, leather, paper, pressed cardboard, mother-of-pearl, celluloid, porcelain, composition, tin, zinc, xylonite, stone, cloth-covered wooden forms, and papier-mâché. Vegetable ivory was said to be the most popular for suits and shirts, and papier-mâché far and away the commonest sort of shoe button.

Nowadays, hard plastic, seashell, metals, and wood are the most common materials used in button-making; the others tending to be used only in premium or antique apparel, or found in collections.

Over 60% of the world&#x27;s button supply comes from Qiaotou, Yongjia County, China.

===Decoration and coating techniques===
Historically, fashions in buttons have also reflected trends in applied aesthetics and the applied visual arts, with buttonmakers using techniques from jewellery making, ceramics, sculpture, painting, printmaking, metalworking, weaving and others. The following are just a few of the construction and decoration techniques that have been used in button-making: 

===Styles of attachment===
*Flat or sew-through buttons have holes through which thread is sewn to attach the button. Flat buttons may be attached by sewing machine rather than by hand and may be used with heavy fabrics by working a thread shank to extend the height of the button above the fabric.

*Shank buttons have a hollow protrusion on the back through which thread is sewn to attach the button. Button shanks may be made from a separate piece of the same or a different substance as the button itself, and added to the back of the button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of the button, in which latter case the button is referred to by collectors as having a &#x27;self-shank&#x27;.
*Stud buttons (also push-through buttons or just studs) are composed from an actual button, connected to a second, button-like element by a narrow metal or plastic bar. Pushed through two opposing holes within what is meant to be kept together, the actual button and its counterpart press it together, keeping it joined. Popular examples of such buttons are shirt studs and cufflinks.
*Snap fasteners (also pressure buttons or press studs) are metal (usually brass) round discs pinched through the fabric. They are often found on clothing, in particular on denim pieces such as pants and jackets. They are more securely fastened to the material. As they rely on a metal rivet attached securely to the fabric, pressure buttons are difficult to remove without compromising the fabric&#x27;s integrity. They are made of two couples: the male stud couple and the female stud couple. Each couple has one front (or top) and rear (or bottom) side (the fabric goes in the middle).
*Toggles are stick-like, with a cord attached at the center. They are passed endways through a hole and then rotated sideways.
*Magnetic buttons, as the name implies, are buttons that attach to each other by being magnetic. The buttons can be attached either by sewing or snapping them into the fabric.

===Fabric buttons===
*Covered buttons are fabric-covered forms with a separate back piece that secures the fabric over the knob.
*Mandarin buttons or frogs are knobs made of intricately knotted strings. Mandarin buttons are a key element in Mandarin dress (&quot;Qi Pao&quot; and &quot;cheongsam&quot; in Chinese), where they are closed with loops. Pairs of mandarin buttons worn as cuff links are called silk knots.
*Worked or cloth buttons are created by embroidering or crocheting tight stitches (usually with linen thread) over a knob or ring called a form. Dorset buttons, handmade from the 17th century to 1750, and Death head buttons are of this type.

===Button sizes===
The size of the button depends on its use. Shirt buttons are generally small, and spaced close together, whereas coat buttons are larger and spaced further apart. Buttons are commonly measured in lignes (also called &quot;lines&quot; and abbreviated &quot;L&quot;), with 40 lines equal to 1 inch. For example, some standard sizes of buttons are 16 lignes (10.16 mm, standard buttons of men&#x27;s shirts) and 32 lignes (20.32 mm, typical button on suit jackets).

==In museums and galleries==

Some museums and art galleries hold culturally, historically, politically, and/or artistically significant buttons in their collections. The Victoria and Albert Museum has many buttons, particularly in its jewellery collection, as does the Smithsonian Institution.

Hammond Turner &amp; Sons, a button-making company in Birmingham, hosts an online museum with an image gallery and historical button-related articles, including an 1852 article on button-making by Charles Dickens. In the US, large button collections are on public display at the Waterbury Button Museum of Waterbury, Connecticut, the Keep Homestead Museum of Monson, Massachusetts, which also hosts an extensive button archive, and in Gurnee, Illinois, at The Button Room.

==Positioning==
Classic clothing has the button on the left side for women and on the right side for men. The reasons for this are unclear, but the choice for men&#x27;s clothing is usually attributed to the need to draw weapons from the left to right; the weapon would then not catch on opening of the clothing. For women&#x27;s clothing the common reason given is that in times when upper-class women&#x27;s clothing was quite elaborate, servants were needed for dressing, and the left placement of the buttons was more convenient for right-handed maids. Some Jews reverse this, following statements in the Torah that favor dressing first on the right side, or from the Kabbalah, in which the right side denotes goodness.

==In politics==
The mainly American tradition of politically significant clothing buttons appears to have begun with the first presidential inauguration of George Washington in 1789. Known to collectors as &quot;Washington Inaugurals&quot;, they were made of copper, brass or Sheffield plate, in large sizes for coats and smaller sizes for breeches. Made in twenty-two patterns and hand-stamped, they are now extremely valuable cultural artifacts.

Between about 1840 and 1916, clothing buttons were used in American political campaigns, and still exist in collections today. Initially, these buttons were predominantly made of brass (though horn and rubber buttons with stamped or moulded designs also exist) and had loop shanks. Around 1860 the badge or pin-back style of construction, which replaced the shanks with long pins, probably for use on lapels and ties, began to appear.

One common practice that survived until recent times on campaign buttons and badges was to include the image of George Washington with that of the candidate in question.

Some of the most famous campaign buttons are those made for Abraham Lincoln. Memorial buttons commemorating Lincoln&#x27;s inaugurations and other life events, including his birth and death, were also made, and are also considered highly collectible.

<text>The AMC Pacer is a two-door compact car produced in the United States by American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1975 through the 1980 model year. The Pacer was also made in Mexico by Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) from 1976 until 1979 and positioned as a premium-priced luxury car.

Design work began in 1971. The rounded shape and large glass area were unusual compared with the three-box designs of the era. The Pacer&#x27;s width is equal to full-sized domestic vehicles at the time, and AMC promoted this unique design feature as &quot;the first wide small car&quot;. The Pacer was the first modern, mass-produced, U.S. automobile design using the cab forward concept.

Upon its introduction, reviews used descriptions such as &quot;futuristic, bold, and unique&quot;. The Pacer featured an aerodynamic &quot;jellybean&quot; styling, numerous innovations such as different door lengths. This was noted &quot;as a space-efficient car, seemingly from the future&quot;. The Pacer stood out at a time when &quot;Detroit was still rolling out boat-sized gas guzzlers.&quot;

==Design==
American Motors&#x27; chief stylist Dick Teague began work on the Pacer in 1971, anticipating an increase in demand for smaller vehicles throughout the decade. The new car was designed to offer the interior room and feel of a big vehicle that drivers of traditional domestic automobiles were accustomed to, but in a much smaller, aerodynamic, and purposefully distinctive exterior package. American Motors called it &quot;Project Amigo&quot; as a fresh design &quot;featuring a body style not seen before, using the latest technology and exceeding upcoming safety regulations&quot;.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;It was the first car designed from the inside out. Four passengers were positioned with reasonable clearances, and then the rest of the car was built around them as compactly as possible.&quot; American Motors explored many unique solutions to what Teague called the &quot;Urban Concept&quot; car. Not only different sized doors for the driver and passenger sides were considered, but also using a Wankel engine and front-wheel-drive. The first development mule was made by shortening both the front and the rear of an AMC Matador by .

The shape was highly rounded with a huge glass area and was very unusual for its time. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine described it as &quot;fresh, bold and functional-looking&quot;. The Pacer featured a rounded and aerodynamic &quot;jellybean&quot; styling The body surface was 37% glass, and its surface area of was 16% more than the average passenger car at the time. The May 1976 issue of &quot;Car and Driver&quot; dubbed it &quot;The Flying Fishbowl,&quot; and it was also described as &quot;the seventies answer to George Jetson&#x27;s mode of transportation&quot; at a time when &quot;Detroit was still rolling out boat-sized gas guzzlers.&quot;

Development was under Product Group Vice President Gerald C. Meyers, whose goal was to develop a unique car: &quot;Everything that we do must distinguish itself as being importantly different than what can be expected from the competition.&quot; Even before its introduction, AMC&#x27;s Board Chairman Roy D. Chapin Jr. described &quot;It will be a visibly different car, maybe even controversial. It&#x27;s an idea that represents a transition between what has been and what&#x27;s coming. Today versus tomorrow.&quot; According to &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, &quot;This is the first time in the history of the American automobile industry that a car manufacturer has said in advance of bringing out a new product that some people may not like.&quot; The Pacer was in sharp contast to the conventional boxy and recliniar automobile body styles of the 1970s. &quot;Road and Track&quot; described the car&#x27;s styling &quot;with all those rounded corners, the lack of distinct edges, and acre upon acre of curvilinear surfaces&quot;.


American Motors explored many futuristic ideas, but the automaker needed more resources to build components from scratch. Instead, they needed to use outside suppliers or adapt existing components and parts in their production facilities. Unique for a comparatively small car, the Pacer was as wide as a full-size American car of the era. American Motors did not describe it as &quot;cab forward&quot;. Nevertheless, the Pacer&#x27;s layout included wheels pushed to the corners (short overhangs), a relatively wide body, and A-pillars moved forward. The windshield was placed over part of the engine compartment, with the bottom edge of the glass forward of the firewall. Contrary to some reports, the Pacer was not widened to accommodate the rear-wheel drive configuration. The editor of &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; asserted that front-wheel drive, as well as a transverse mid-engined configuration, were among &quot;various mechanical layouts ... tossed around by the idea people at AMC,&quot; adding that &quot;it&#x27;s unlikely they ever had much hope of being able to produce anything other than their traditional front engine and rear drive, using components already in production.&quot;

The introductory 1975 AMC advertising and literature proclaimed it &quot;the first wide small car&quot;. The width was dictated partly by marketing strategy—American drivers were accustomed to large vehicles, and the Pacer&#x27;s occupants had the impression of being in a larger car—and partly because AMC&#x27;s assembly lines were already set up for full-size vehicles.

Teague&#x27;s low-drag design was highly innovative, predating the fuel crisis and the flood of small imports into the American market. Pacer&#x27;s drag coefficient of 0.43 was relatively low for that time. Teague even eliminated rain gutters, smoothly blending the tops of the doors into the roof—an aerodynamic detail that, although criticized at the time for allowing rain onto the front seat, has become the norm in today&#x27;s designs.

Also unique was that the passenger door was four inches (101 mm) longer than the driver&#x27;s on the left side. This made passenger egress easier, particularly from the rear seats, and they would also tend to use the safer curbside in countries that drive on the right.

Engineers also took an entirely fresh approach with the Pacer&#x27;s front suspension and engine mounting. It was the first U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars, with the coil spring between the two control arms seated on the lower wishbone arm at the bottom and in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a unique tool to press the one-piece bushings in and out of the mounting brackets.

Other aspects of the Pacer were designed for ease of service, including the dashboard and instrument panel—using a minimum number of easily accessible screws and featuring a removable cover/bezel without the need to disconnect the speedometer cable—and access to the light bulbs. The Pacer&#x27;s design was ranked to be equal with the new Aspen-Volare compacts as the most serviceable cars in the industry.

The Pacer was the second American production car, after the Ford Pinto, to feature rack-and-pinion steering. The system was mounted low at the front of the crossmember. The body was designed with the aim that structural lines protected it from hit damage, and AMC engineers claimed that they succeeded in more than 50% of the car&#x27;s surface.


In the mid-1970s, the U.S. government mandated significant vehicle safety improvements starting with the 1980 model year cars. These included front-end crash testing, side crash testing, and rollover testing, as well as the installation of bumpers that would resist a impact at the front and at the rear. &quot;Full-circle body protection was designed into the Pacer, starting with the energy-absorbing bumper mounts&quot; through upper and lower box-section rails on each side extending back to the front pillars, as well as from the bases of the pillars behind the doors, the box-section members in the body floor curve up and continue past the rear wheel houses. The Pacer was designed from the start to meet the expected stringent safety specifications.

The low beltline and window design afforded the driver outstanding visibility. The Pacer had laminated safety glass in the windshield. The articulated front wipers were hidden when in their parked position, while a rear wiper and washer system was optional.


General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler persuaded U.S. government authorities that modifying existing production cars to comply with the new regulations was not financially viable. They would face enormous expenses to produce new, safety-compliant vehicles. As a result of the lobbying, the requirements were reduced, including the deletion of several safety features. For example, production Pacers did not feature an actual roll bar over the passenger compartment, but the bump in the roof remained. The design of the Pacer was strong for a small car, making it solid and heavy with protection features that included strong and massive bumpers. The wide B-pillars were described by AMC as having &quot;roll bar-like characteristics&quot;. Even with the Pacer&#x27;s large glass area, passengers are not positioned near the windows because they all bow out from around seated occupants. The Pacer&#x27;s wide stance also makes it stable and provides a unique feeling when inside the car, providing credence to the marketing phrase used by AMC: &quot;You only ride like a Pacer if you&#x27;re wide like a Pacer.&quot;

The editors of &quot;The Motor&quot; opined the &quot;more you study both the general layout and the detail features of the Pacer, the more convinced you become that the men who dreamed it up and decided to make it actually do drive around in crowded cities and consequently realize from their own experience that the traditional big barges are less and less easy to navigate through our streets.&quot; The unusual proportions of the Pacer provided buyers the &quot;idea of feeling like they were sitting in the front of a roomy big American car, but without all the unnecessary length.&quot; &quot;Car and Driver&quot; road testers also noted the Pacer&#x27;s &quot;smooth and quiet ride can probably be attributed to a front subframe that isolates the passenger capsule from the engine, suspension and steering loads&quot; making the car &quot;eminently stable and controllable, with its rack-and-pinion steering and wide track&quot;.

The Pacer&#x27;s remaining safety features were not strongly advertised and seldom influenced a potential customer&#x27;s purchasing decision. The car&#x27;s extra weight—due in part to the safety equipment and the abundance of heavy glass—hurt fuel economy: production models tested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave in the city, but or better on the highway (depending on driving habits and transmission), thanks to aerodynamic efficiency.

Initially, the car was designed to have a Wankel rotary engine. In 1973, AMC signed a licensing agreement with Curtiss-Wright to build Wankels for cars and Jeep-type vehicles. (The agreement also permitted Curtiss-Wright to sell rotaries elsewhere.) Later, AMC decided instead to purchase the engines from General Motors (GM), who were developing them for use in their cars. However, GM canceled development in 1974 for reasons that included durability issues, the fuel crisis, tooling costs (for the engines and a new product line designed to take advantage of the rotary&#x27;s ultra-compact dimensions), and the upcoming (the late 1970s) U.S. emissions legislation. It was also thought that the high-revving Wankel would not suit Americans accustomed to low revs and high torque.

General Motors&#x27;s change of plans left the Pacer without an engine. American Motors took a calculated risk and introduced the new model. The company&#x27;s over-commitment to the project resulted in entrapment with so much money and effort in the car&#x27;s design. Engineers hastily reconfigured it to accept their existing straight-six engine. This involved a complete redesign of the drivetrain and firewall to keep the longer engine within the body dimensions designed for the Wankel, but allowed the Pacer to share many mechanical components with other AMC models. &quot;Newsweek&quot; noted the &quot;Pacer&#x27;s primary competitive drawback is gasoline mileage: AMC offers only six-cylinder engines and the car gets only 18 miles per gallon in the city and suburban driving vs. 23 mpg or more for some four-cylinder competitors.&quot;

The &quot;outside of the box&quot; thinking incorporated by AMC in the Pacer as the first &quot;wide, small car&quot; attempted to capture a revolutionary change in the marketplace, but a radical departure from what was accepted by consumers as &quot;good styling&quot; was a risky strategy. Only the largest firms can stick with a radical element until it &quot;grows&quot;, and the automaker&#x27;s dominance in the marketplace may eventually establish it as a standard feature. However, by the late 1970s the styling research axiom no longer applied that if a car with some controversial styling was liked by at least half of the potential market segment; then chances were good that this feature was a differential advantage for the manufacturer. The AMC Pacer incorporated many controversial styling and design innovations that led to its market failure after five model years.

American Motors developed the Pacer by identifying emerging trends and design technologies, but it faced a small window of opportunity since a product that comes out either too early or too late can fail even if the opportunity was there initially. A further complication was the purchasing dynamics and the Pacer&#x27;s design was focused on maximizing the internal sense of space, while the market focused on external dimensions. Many of the attributes the Pacer incorporated became the goal of all manufacturers in the two decades that followed.

With an uncommonly wide and short body for a small car, the Pacer&#x27;s design is still controversial, while its engines did not contribute to fuel economy. Nevertheless, &quot;the foresight by Teague and AMC was correct&quot; with approaches to meet the evolving U.S. government regulations covering automobiles (such as the Highway Safety Act of 1970 and the new National Highway Traffic Safety Administration).

==Production and attributes==


===Coupe===
American Motors began the development of an entirely new car in 1971. It invested $52 million in tooling and $8 million in associated expenses to bring out the Pacer. Production began in January and the Pacer was unveiled on 13 January 1975. Sales in AMC dealer showrooms began on 28 February 1975. The Pacer was designed to attract buyers of traditional large cars to a smaller package during a time when gasoline prices were projected to rise dramatically. The new car was well received and seen as futuristic by journalists and buyers. Pacer production, which started at 530 cars a day was increased to 700 a day by April, and went up to 800 per day in September. Pacer sales success can be attributed to lack of competition from the other domestic automakers who had been blindsided by the oil crisis. Production passed 100,000 Pacers in less than eight months after production began. This was the first time a new AMC model achieved the 100,000 mark in less than one year. By way of comparison, it took more than two years for the Gremlin to reach 100,000 units after production of it began in January 1970. The early demand outstripping production capacity affected the Pacer&#x27;s build quality. In its first year of production, the Pacer sold well, with 145,528 units. The increased demand for compact, economy vehicles grew rapidly, and the other automakers were rolling out their small cars. Pacer sales fell after the first two years.

The Pacer&#x27;s unconventional styling was commonly cited in its continued lack of success. Other concerns included the limited cargo space when carrying a full load of passengers (primarily because of the steeply sloping rear roofline design). Folding down the rear seat backrest formed a flat-floored, cargo area. Design work on the new car began five years before its launch. Richard Teague explained this &quot;was before weight was magnified as a super economy consideration&quot;. The Pacer was heavy, with only six-cylinder engines available, and drivers cited a lack of power. &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; wrote, &quot;American Motors had already quoted a curb weight of 2990 lb. for the basic Pacer when we first wrote about the car, and that already seemed quite heavy; but when we weighed the test car (whose air conditioning, automatic transmission, power steering and so forth would not account for the full difference) it registered an astounding 3425 lb.&quot;

The standard I6, with a single-barrel carburetor was optimized for low emissions (all vehicles at the time carried emissions-reducing devices, including exhaust gas recirculation); making the Pacer relatively low-powered (&quot;The Pacer comes with either of two AMC inline six-cylinder engines, both producing 100 bhp, but the larger 258-cu-in. unit deliver[s] better mid-range torque&quot;). The EPA fuel mileage results showed the one-barrel engine with manual transmission achieved better economy ( city and highway) compared to the standard, lower displacement drive train ( city and highway). When equipped with the automatic transmission the Pacer&#x27;s fuel economy was almost identical between the engines. Additionally, a two-barrel version of the engine was available with automatic transmission, which helped performance and the same fuel consumption rating as the one-barrel version. The EPA results noted the same fuel economy in actual on-the-road driving because in-use mileage depends on many factors. Nevertheless, the EPA method can be used to compare fuel use by cars under identical conditions, and the EPA calculated the industrywide average of the 1976 model year cars tested to be in simulated city-plus-highway driving. None of the 1976 Pacer drivetrain configurations included catalytic converters and met California&#x27;s more stringent antipollution standards.

In mid-year 1976, a floor-shifted four-speed manual transmission was made available on the Pacers. Because of the requirement to use unleaded gasoline, a new &quot;quench-head was incorporated in I6 engines for 1977 that pushed the air-fuel mixture closer to the spark plug, created more turbulence for better mixing, allowed an additional 3 degrees of spark advance without knock, and gain an extra one mile per gallon fuel efficiency. By the time a V8 was offered for the 1978 Pacer, AMC introduced a line of &quot;luxury-compact&quot; models (the AMC Concord). Moreover, gasoline prices in the U.S. remained high, limiting demand for V8-powered vehicles.

===Station wagon===
A station wagon body style was added for the 1977 model year. Structurally the same as the coupe and providing &quot;lots of head, leg, and elbow room&quot; as the coupe, but the wagon featured significantly increased cargo capacity. The wagon body style was as novel as the unusual Pacer coupe model and featured huge doors for access. The design was identical to the coupe up to the B-pillar. A new roof extended from the B-pillar to a full-width rear hatch hinged at the roof line that provided an opening down to the top of the rear bumper. Rather than lengthening the coupe&#x27;s wheelbase, the station wagon featured a extension, redesigned rear quarter panels, and rear side windows. The stretch made the wagon body design weigh only more than the coupe. The Pacer wagon also had a less unusual-looking body style with a squared-off back and straight, almost upright, rear-side windows. The wagon&#x27;s rear side glass featured standard vent windows, while front vent windows were optional on all Pacers. The broad and rear liftgate eased the task of loading cargo as it opened to a wide, flat cargo area with of space, about 50% more than the coupe. Additionally, the back cushion of the rear seat could be unlatched and folded down to form a continuation of the cargo floor.

The demand for small station wagons represented 30 to 40% of the total car-line market in the U.S. The two-door Pacer wagon was positioned as entering a new segment rather than as a substitute for AMC&#x27;s continuing four-door Hornet station wagon.

Some Pacer wagon models featured simulated woodgrain trim on the lower body sides and the liftgate.

===Discontinuation===
Increasing competition from the Big Three U.S. automakers and the rapid consumer shift to small imported cars during the late 1970s decreased demand for the Pacer models. Automobile buyers in the U.S. adjusted to smaller and lighter cars, mainly imports that offered better gas mileage; the AMC Pacer could not match German and Japanese cars. Achieving about , the Pacer was not a top choice for customers during the 1979 energy crisis. Moreover, AMC&#x27;s partnership with Renault brought the Renault 5 named &quot;Le Car&quot; to the AMC dealers as a more economical model. The design of the Pacer prompted changes to the Renault 5 to adapt it to some of the U.S. marketplace conditions.

Similar to its mid-year introduction, on 3 December 1979, production of the Pacer ended at the Kenosha, Wisconsin, assembly plant where it had begun five years earlier. A total of 280,000 Pacers were built. Increasing competition from the Big Three U.S. automakers and the rapid consumer shift to imported cars during the late 1970s are the reasons for this outcome. Automobile buyers in the U.S. adjusted to smaller and lighter cars, particularly imports that offered better gas mileage; the AMC Pacer could not match German and Japanese cars. The large glass areas increased the car&#x27;s weight. Achieving about , the Pacer was not a top choice for customers during the 1979 energy crisis. Moreover, AMC&#x27;s partnership with Renault brought the Renault 5 named &quot;Le Car&quot; to the AMC dealers as a more economical model. Nevertheless, the design of the Pacer inspired the restyling of the Renault 5 to meet the needs and requirements of the American Market.

===Model designations===


The Pacer was first positioned in the marketplace as an economy car offering a big car ride with numerous comfort and convenience options. It was soon repositioned as a small luxury car. There were numerous comfort, convenience, and appearance packages while the range of options increased over the model years.

&quot;X&quot; Package: Available on the Pacer coupe from 1975 until 1977. The trim package consisted of vinyl bucket seats, a sports steering wheel, and custom trim, as well as a floor-mounted gear shift and front sway bar. The model received exterior chrome features, styled road wheels, &quot;Pacer X&quot; decals on the doors, and other package identification. For 1978 a &quot;Sport Package&quot; replaced the X-Package, and included bucket seats, sports steering wheel, seven combinations of two-tone paint for upper and lower bodyside, and slot-styled road wheels with radial tires. The option package was available only with the I6 or V8 engine.

&quot;D/L&quot; Package: A more upscale edition, the D/L was available for the entire run of the Pacer production and became the base model in 1978. The package originally included a &quot;Navajo design&quot; seating fabric, a woodgrain instrument panel, and some interior features that were otherwise optional. The exterior had additional chrome accents, different wheel covers, and identification badging.

&quot;Limited&quot;: Available in 1979–1980, the Limited had leather seats, extra soundproofing, and deeper-pile carpet (18-oz. vs. the standard 12-oz) as standard, plus amenities that were otherwise options, including AM radio, power door locks, power windows, and tilt steering wheel. The exterior had chrome accents, styled road wheels, and &quot;Limited&quot; badging.

&quot;Sundowner&quot;: Available through AMC dealers in California for 1975 only, the Sundowner was a basic $3,599 (suggested retail price) Pacer with options that listed for $300 included at no extra cost. In addition to the mandatory California engine emissions controls and bumper guards, the package included &quot;Basketry Weave&quot; fabric upholstery with coordinated trim on the door panels, plus remote control exterior mirror, rear window washer and wiper, styled road wheels with whitewall tires, and a roof rack.

&quot;Levi&#x27;s&quot; Package: Introduced for the 1977 model year to capitalize on the popularity of the Levi&#x27;s Gremlin and Hornet, the Levi&#x27;s Pacer had blue denim-like upholstery and door-panel trim, with small Levi&#x27;s tags on the front seats. The copper buttons in AMC&#x27;s other Levi&#x27;s models were omitted, and a Levi&#x27;s logo sticker was applied on the front fender. The version, which could be combined with the Pacer X package, did not sell in large numbers and it was dropped for the 1978 model year.

Carl Green Enterprises (CGE) Pacers: these cars, modified by automobile designer Carl Green, had AMC V8 engines plus flares, air dams, and wings. The CGE Pacers appeared in &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, &quot;Popular Hot Rodding&quot;, and &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; magazines. Green also built two Pacer pace cars for B.F. Goodrich to use in the International Motor Sports Association circuit and provided body kits for Amos Johnson&#x27;s Team Highball racecars.

Pacers without the optional vinyl roof trim could be finished in several unique two-tone paint combinations, with front and rear scuff molding extensions on the body sides. The two-tone treatment was changed in 1977 to an &quot;up and over the roof&quot; accent paint scheme for the remainder of production.

Moving toward more luxury features, power door locks became available in 1978, and in 1979, power windows were added to the options list. For both 1979 and 1980, a hood ornament and center chrome hood strip were added.

===Show cars===
====Pacer Stinger====
For the 1976 auto show circuit, AMC developed a customized Pacer Stinger. The exterior featured matte black painted lower body panels and yellow pearl paint that faded to a pale yellow on the roof. The back half of the car had over-the-roof matte black &quot;bumblebee stripes&quot; that continued on the tailgate. The Stinger was fitted with oversize radial tires mounted on Jackman Star (brand) aluminum racing road wheels, a side-mounted exhaust, NACA duct on the hood, auxiliary Cibié (brand) driving lights, as well as a front spoiler and wheel well fender extensions. The Stinger&#x27;s interior was black with a floor-mounted shifter and front bucket seats with a center console. Black and yellow stripes on the front and rear seats completed the &quot;bumblebee&quot; theme, while the black door panels had yellow side cushions.

====AM Van====
The 1977 AM Van is a custom van on a three-quarter scale with Pacer lines. Designed by Richard Teague and based on an existing car platform, but without an interior and no mechanical components. Proposed features included four-wheel drive, and it had a &quot;turbo&quot; decal on the double side-opening rear doors. Displayed as one of seven vehicles making up the &quot;Concept 80&quot; auto show circuit tour, it was voted the most appealing, receiving 31% of the votes. It never moved past the concept stage, but &quot;inadvertently foreshadowed the minivan craze that would sweep America in the mid-1980s&quot; as well as the &quot;small worker van&quot; market segment.

====Crown Pacer====
American Motors was evaluating the Pacer as a compact personal luxury model with the Crown Pacer concept car that was shown at the 1978 show circuit. Starting with the Detroit Auto Show in the fall of 1977, AMC aimed to create a luxury image for the Pacer. Finished in pearlescent white with a two-section vinyl-covered roof that was padded, the Crown Pacer&#x27;s exterior featured gold accents - including the spokes of the wire wheels. Pictures from the Chicago Auto Show show it with an interior upholstered in white leather and numerous luxury features such as a large inbuilt sun roof, real wire wheels, full rocker panel bright trim, color-matched integrated flexible front and fear fascia and bumper covers with black rubber guards and impact (nerf) strips as well as a full-width grille that also hid the headlights.

==Electric Pacers==
Some AMC Pacers were converted to plug-in electric vehicles.

 (EVA) of Cleveland was best known for its Change of Pace model – a built-to-order adaptation of the Pacer that was priced at $12,360 in 1978. The company converted over 100 units.

First available in the sedan version, power came from eighteen 6-volt lead–acid batteries to a series DC motor with a stock three-speed automatic transmission. The EVA Change of Pace sedan weighed and reached with a range. Regenerative braking is used in conjunction with the standard hydraulic brake system which uses front-wheel discs and rear drums. Vehicle tests that focused on the electrical drive system including the batteries, controller, and motor &quot;found that the Pacer performance is approximately equal to the majority of the vehicles tested in the 1977 assessment.&quot;

Later, a station wagon version had twenty VARTA batteries housed in two-packs (front and rear), with a (at 3,000 rpm) motor, and the car was complete in every detail down to a gas heater. The electric Pacer wagon was one of the more expensive cars at $14,000. The Lead Industries Association (LIA) sponsored a tour for government and industry officials that featured an EVA Pacer wagon. Consolidated Edison in New York City purchased 40 modified AMC Pacers from EVA. The United States Army also included EVA Pacers in its inventory of special-purpose electric vehicles.

A video documentary about the Electric Vehicle Association&#x27;s electric Pacers is titled &quot;A Change of Pace.&quot; A fully restored wagon has had its original silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) control replaced with a modern controller and the &quot;hydraulically operated hybrid vehicle recharging system&quot; removed because of its lack of efficiency to use compressed air from suspension travel to power a small generator to recharge the batteries.

==International markets==
===Europe===


American Motors exported the Pacer to several European nations. Jean-Charles, the AMC distributor in Paris, likened the rounded body of the Pacer to the buttocks of an attractive woman in magazine advertisements. Pacers exported to Europe were available in higher trim levels.

Sales were not very good, but in Belgium, a brand-new Pacer could be purchased as late as 1983.

====United Kingdom====
American Motors vehicles were exported to the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s and sold by Rambler Motors (A.M.C.) Ltd in London with dealers in London, York, Kent, and Worcester. While other models such as the Rambler Classic, Rebel, Ambassador, and Matador had been exported as completed factory right-hand-drive vehicles, the Pacer was only built with left-hand drive. A British company, C.T. Wooler, in Andover, Hampshire had been in the business for a long time converting LHD cars to RHD and entered into an agreement with AMC to convert its vehicles. C.T. Wooler converted the Pacer to right-hand drive by leaving the majority of the steering gear on the left-hand side of the car and running a chain-drive behind the dashboard from the steering wheel (now on the right-hand side) to the top of the steering column. The car retained its unequal-length doors, designed for LHD markets, meaning that in the United Kingdom, the longer door was on the driver&#x27;s side, leaving the passengers to use the smaller door, which &quot;in the typically confined British parking spot was virtually impossible&quot;. The Pacer was wider than a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow and slightly longer than the then-current Ford Cortina. The British motoring press adversely reviewed the car and AMC soon stopped exporting it.

===Mexico===
The Pacer was produced in Mexico by Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) starting in 1976. They were marketed as premium-priced luxury cars. The VAM versions came with different engines, interiors, and other components because vehicles made in Mexico had to have at least 60% locally sourced parts. The engine was designed by AMC but was modified and built by VAM. A unique to Mexico straight-six engine was standard. It was designed to cope with low octane fuel and high altitudes. This engine featured dished pistons with a bore and stroke, as well as a unique head and exhaust porting design. Unavailable in Mexico were the V8 engine, four-speed transmission, three-speed transmission with an overdrive unit, or the station wagon body style.

====1976====
The initial VAM Pacers were the equivalents to AMC&#x27;s domestic Pacer DL models, except for a longer list of standard equipment and had some of the features later included on AMC&#x27;s &quot;Limited&quot; models. The VAM Pacer was offered in one version and had no model or trim badges. The standard engine was VAM&#x27;s I6 producing with 7.7:1 compression ratio, 266-degree camshaft, and a Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor coupled to a steel intake manifold. The initial production featured a T-150 three-speed manual transmission with a heavy-duty clutch and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. All VAM Pacers came with heavy-duty suspension (front sway bar with heavy-duty springs and shock absorbers), power brakes with front disks, power rack and pinion steering, a larger radiator with coolant recovery tank, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, and electronic ignition.

Standard convenience features included a custom luxury steering wheel, column-mounted manual shifter, woodgrain dashboard trim, inside hood release, individual reclining front seats with adjustable headrests, center folding armrest, fixed two-point seatbelts, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers integrated into the wiper arms, 140 km/h speedometer, courtesy lights, monaural AM radio with a single in-dash speaker, electric analog clock, heater with windshield defroster, lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, tinted windshield, plastic door panels with cloth insert and pull strap, dual rear ashtrays, folding down rear bench seat, trunk carpet, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner (US base model type), and round dome light.

The external appearance and equipment of the VAM Pacer consisted of a full bright molding package (wheel lips, top edges of the hood and fenders, window surrounds, rocker panels), a bright rear panel between the taillights and the rear license plate housing, protective side moldings, front and rear bumper guards, bumper nerfing strips, five-mile-per-hour bumpers with recovering shocks (only VAM car with this characteristic along with the Matador-based Classic line), five-spoke in-house VAM wheels, trim rings and full cover volcano center caps on the wheels, ER78x14 radial tires, driver&#x27;s side manual remote mirror, radio antenna on the passenger&#x27;s side fender, squared VAM logo emblems on the fenders, Pacer emblems on the fenders and bright rear panel and a two-step hood latch.

The positioning of the VAM Pacer was different compared to the initial marketing by AMC in its domestic market. The car was focused to be a futuristic and high-end luxury car from its introduction, while the AMC counterpart was first targeted as a small car to consumers accustomed to large vehicles and AMC later repositioned it as a more upscale model. This strategy was reinforced after the first 200 units produced when the three-speed automatic transmission became standard equipment list and added an &quot;Automático&quot; emblem on the bright rear panel. The VAM Pacer became the most costly and luxurious VAM car at the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic line. The uniqueness of the model coupled with its level of luxury and price range made the Pacer a default flagship model for the company. However, the &#x27;luxury compact&#x27; was not a known segment to Mexican consumers.

An unusual aspect of the 1976 VAM Pacer was its seat upholstery. VAM&#x27;s design was based on AMC&#x27;s Oleg Cassini interior for the 1974–1975 Matador coupe. This &quot;haute couture&quot; interior was featured in the Pacer as well as in all three VAM Classic models for the year. The Pacer&#x27;s seats incorporated a golden Cassini crest on the adjustable headrests and a pattern with copper buttons forming squares. Unlike the AMC Pacer, the VAM Pacer included many standard features and only a few factory options. These included a rear wiper and washer, rear defroster, reading dome light, trunk cover, remote-controlled driver&#x27;s side mirror, luxury wheel covers, and heavy-duty cooling system (seven-bladed flexible fan and fan shroud). A universal air conditioning system was available only as a dealership option.

====1977====
The 1977 VAM Pacer was almost the same as in the previous year on the outside, but made more luxurious inside. The Cassini-style upholstery was replaced with a more discreet luxury design with a &quot;zigzag&quot; placement of plain soft buttons on the upholstery forming diagonal lines. The AM monaural radio was replaced by an AM/FM monaural unit, three-point retractable seatbelts replaced the lap-only units, and a light for the glove compartment was now standard. The engine underwent engineering upgrades that included an all-new head design with an improved cooling system and quench-type combustion chambers, a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio, and a new two-barrel aluminum intake manifold, while the rear differential gear ratio changed from 3.31:1 to 3.07:1. These upgrades gave the VAM Pacer an estimated 12 net horsepower increase over the previous year with improved fuel economy as well as increased top speed while maintaining torque and the car&#x27;s towing capacity. This was also the first year that VAM models could be ordered with a factory air conditioning system. Pacers with the A/C included five dashboard air vents as well as a 55-amp alternator, a flexible seven-bladed cooling fan, a three-row radiator, and a fan shroud. The previously optional luxury wheel covers were now included as standard equipment.

====1978====
The 1978 model year VAM Pacers gained new hood and grille designs. The only technical difference of the year was the replacement of the Holley 2300 carburetor in favor of a Motorcraft 2150 unit with a built-in altitude compensator despite having a slightly lower flow. This reduced power but enhanced emission certification and was more reliable in changing altitudes. New standard features included a hood light, a speedometer in both kilometers and miles per hour, door panels including a vertical stripe pattern over their top edges, a different AM/FM radio model, a new flat-faced luxury steering wheel design with an AMC logo, and new seat designs. The heater was improved in the form of air vents appearing to the left of the instrument cluster, the center of the dashboard above the ashtray, and over the top right corner of the glovebox door regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. The heater controls were revised, obtaining the VENT option in airflow selection, which was now a sliding lever instead of the five buttons used in the prior two years. The two remaining air vents, the passenger&#x27;s side one over the top left corner of the glove box door and the vent on the driver&#x27;s side integrated under the steering column were included with the A/C system.

====1979====
The 1979 VAM Pacer was a continuation of the 1978 model in terms of appearance, with the exceptions of the previously standard wheel covers and a new hood bright molding with front ornament. All VAM Pacers now featured VAM&#x27;s in-house five-spoke wheels with trim rings and chrome volcano hubcaps with exposed lug nuts. New seat designs with a horizontally striped pattern and Barcelona crests on the headrests were a luxury feature (identical to the AMC Matador Barcelona version), a new steering wheel design with a soft rectangular center button, all-new door panels designs in plastic and vinyl with a rigid top pull strap and sliding locks with woodgrain accents. The headliner was changed to a cloth-wrapped unit. VAM began using the net rating system for measuring engine output. The 1979 VAM I6 engine was now rated at at 3900 rpm. The electrical system was revised with a new fuse box located under the dashboard on the driver&#x27;s side firewall. A total of 369 VAM Pacers were sold.
==== VAM Pacer X ====
A new model was introduced in 1979, the VAM Pacer X, with a high-performance focus. It featured a high-output version of the engine with a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio, a semi-ported head, centrifugal advance-modified electronic distributor for higher acceleration, a set of headers with two final outlets divided between the first three and second three cylinders (even though a final single exhaust was used through a Y-shaped portion), and the return of the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. The output for this engine, code-named &quot;4.6 SX&quot; is estimated at net at 4000 rpm. This engine made the Pacer X the second-best performing VAM car of 1979, surpassing by a single tenth of a second the four-speed American Rally AMX (Concord AMX equivalent) with its standard in VAM&#x27;s acceleration tests.

The Pacer X was available in only three colors (black, white, and wine red), included colored-matched bumpers, and had most of the bright trim deleted. The model featured thin golden stripes surrounding the door and side glass areas extending through the roof from side to side, the VAM eight-spoke sports steel wheels were painted in gold with blacked-out volcano hubcaps, the rear and side glass moldings were also blacked out, and &quot;Pacer X&quot; decals were on the lower front corners of the doors. The Pacer X interior included unique reclining front bucket seats, a center console with a locking compartment and ashtray instead of an armrest, a set of &quot;rallye&quot; gauges (water temperature, clock, ammeter, and oil pressure) instead of the in-dashboard ashtray, a 6000 rpm tachometer in place of the electric clock, three-arm spoked sports steering wheel with a circular horn button with a VAM logo, floor-mounted three-speed automatic transmission, remote-controlled driver&#x27;s side door mirror, and reading dome lights. Air conditioning was standard in this model and most units included a tinted glass pop-up sunroof. The remaining equipment was the same as the standard model: power brakes, power steering, front sway bar, as well as heavy-duty shock absorbers and springs, 3.07:1 rear axle ratio, heavy-duty cooling system, AM/FM monaural radio, tinted windshield, light group, inside hood release, and three-point retractable seatbelts. The VAM Pacer X was limited to 250 units and is the most collectible Pacer model in Mexico.

A total of 619 VAM Pacers were produced during 1979. Unlike the U.S. market AMC Pacer, 1979 was the last year of the line in Mexico.

A 1976 Pacer was driven by Gordon Olsen and Bob Stone in the 1979 SCORE Baja 1000 Pro Class race and finished Class 6 (production cars) in second place, behind a Ford Ranchero truck. With a high rate of dropouts, &quot;anyone that officially finishes a Baja race is a winner.&quot; Although many questioned &quot;What&#x27;s a nice odd econo-car like you doing in an off-road race?&quot;, the car was doing very well with Olsen swapping the lead with the V8 powered truck. However, an impact resulted in the destruction of the Pacer&#x27;s radiator giving the lead to the Ford truck after 21 hours and 20 minutes of racing.

==Reviews==
The May 1976 issue of &quot;Car and Driver&quot; dubbed it &quot;The Flying Fishbowl,&quot; and it was also described as &quot;the seventies answer to George Jetson&#x27;s mode of transportation&quot;.

A 2005 &quot;Hemmings Classic Car&quot; magazine article said that in 1975 the Pacer was &quot;sleek&quot; and &quot;audacious&quot;; &quot;it looked like the car of the future&quot; and &quot;the automotive press loved it&quot;. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine, one of many that pictured the car on the cover, said it was &quot;the most creative, most people oriented auto born in the U.S. in 15 years&quot;.

&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; described that the Pacer &quot;scored quite high in our tests. We would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants a fairly small car.&quot; The report concluded that the Pacer did &quot;at least as well as the Dodge Dart, the Plymouth Valiant, and the Chevrolet Nova, the U.S. compacts we like best,&quot; and that &quot;overall, the Pacer scored better than such domestic subcompacts like the Ford Pinto, the Chevrolet Vega, and AMC&#x27;s own Gremlin.&quot;

&quot;Small Cars&quot; magazine noted that &quot;admiration was an obvious reaction&quot; at the press preview, and that &quot;the knowledgeable product writers knew without being told that they were privileged to be there to see something new in automobile design&quot;. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; ran a cover story with design and engineering details.

Michael Lamm, writing in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, commented on many &quot;thoughtful touches that distinguish AMC&#x27;s strikingly futuristic new Pacer&quot;. He said the ride was &quot;not choppy as in so many short-wheelbase cars&quot;, the rack-and-pinion steering gave &quot;handling a feeling of precision ... sticking well in turns, with hard cornering generally solid and predictable&quot;, the &quot;tight turning radius&quot; made parking &quot;easy&quot;, and the steering wheel was too big. Summing up, he said that with its &quot;very modern styling, ample power and generous interior&quot; the Pacer was &quot;more car&quot; than &quot;the Mustang II or &quot;GM&#x27;s sporty compacts (Monza, Skyhawk/Starfire)&quot;, and that its performance felt &quot;strong—certainly on a par with most V8s.&quot;

Don Sherman wrote in the February 1975 issue of &quot;Car and Driver&quot; that it was &quot;our first real urban transporter...There is, of course, the chance of monumental failure; it might be another Tucker ahead of its time ... But...with its high priority on comfortable and efficient travel and absence of Mach 2 styling, [it] at least seems right for the current state of duress. Consider this bold offering from AMC a test: Are we buying cars for transportation yet, or are they still social props?&quot;

The April 1975 issue of &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; road test article described the Pacer&#x27;s appearance as &quot;bold, clean and unique...even when it&#x27;s going 60 mph it looks as if it&#x27;s standing still...&quot; but noted that, even with the test car&#x27;s optional front disc brakes, &quot;in the usual panic-stop tests...our driver had one of his most anxious moments ever as the Pacer screeched, skidded and demanded expert attention at the steering wheel to keep from going altogether out of control. The histrionics are reflected in long stopping distances from highway speeds... [The car&#x27;s] engineering—old-fashioned and unimaginative in the extreme—does not match the perky design&quot;, which the magazine declared &quot;most attractive to look at and pleasant to sit in&quot;.
In a follow-up road test in August 1976, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; wrote: &quot;Since its introduction in January 1975, we have been quite smitten with AMC&#x27;s Pacer.&quot; The magazine criticized the performance and the absence of a 4-speed transmission. A 2-barrel carburetor was offered on the larger six at the end of 1975, as well as a 4-speed manual, but the testers noted that although &quot;the 2-bbl Pacer was faster than the 1-bbl car by a fair margin, it did not &#x27;feel&#x27; faster&quot; (author&#x27;s emphasis). They commended the car&#x27;s comfort: &quot;Even with its compact exterior dimensions, the Pacer is one of the most comfortable 4-passenger cars around...The wide bucket seats were firm, but very comfortable...Front passenger leg room is extraordinary even with the seat racked well forward, and the rear seat leg room exceeds such full-sizers as the Buick Riviera and Continental Mark IV.&quot;

The British press was critical, and the cover of &quot;The Motor&quot;, a weekly automobile magazine, stated: &quot;We test the Pacer – and wish we hadn&#x27;t.&quot; A retrospective by the industry publication &quot;Automotive News&quot; described the 1975 debut of the Pacer as &quot;one of Detroit&#x27;s more polarizing designs.&quot;

&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine described the newly added 1977 station wagon body style as a &quot;styling coup&quot;, and wrote: &quot;Who needs the coupe!&quot; The Pacer has been described as &quot;amazingly versatile and quite advanced for the times&quot;.

By 1978 the luster had worn off the design, and as more sophisticated competitors were introduced, the press began criticizing the lack of power and performance. Nevertheless, after almost fifty years, reviews describe the &quot;intriguing&quot; AMC Pacer with its virtues as &quot;call it brave, stupid or both, but you don&#x27;t get cars like this any more.&quot;

==In popular culture==


In 1976 an AMC Pacer X was used as product placement in the hit French film &quot;The Wing or the Thigh&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;aile ou la cuisse&quot;), driven by the French actor Coluche.

A 1976 AMC Pacer Hatchback was a featured car in the 1992 movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, and again in the 1993 movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;. The car is called the &quot;mirthmobile&quot; and is integral to the movie references for the culture as Wayne and Garth &quot;are performing the seventies for the nineties&quot;. The Pacer used in both movies was painted bright blue with flame decals, with stock steel wheels and wheel covers in the front, and aftermarket chrome-plated steel wheels in the rear. It features a two-tone light blue-and-beige vinyl interior and a licorice dispenser mounted in place of the overhead light in the headliner.
After being unused for over 20 years, the Pacer was restored to the same specifications as in the movie. The car was sold for $37,000 at the 2016 Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In the 1995 animated film &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, Goofy&#x27;s much-abused car is a thinly veiled, cartoonish version of a 1978 AMC Pacer station wagon. The elementary school attended by director Kevin Lima was near an AMC dealership.

A blue 1976 AMC Pacer was used as the &quot;Burgermobile&quot; in the 1997 film &quot;Good Burger.&quot; The car was modified with a large hamburger encompassing the hood and other fast food-stylized decor attached to the rear bumper, hubcaps, windshield wipers, and roof. Two illuminated red arrows were also attached to the sides of the vehicle, both serving as turn signals. After the movie, the car was purchased by the International Hamburger Hall of Fame and the Hamburger Museum in Florida. In April 2019, the car was sold to Mike Johnson, owner of the Hi-Pointe Drive-In in St. Louis, Missouri.

In the 2011 film &quot;Cars 2&quot;, the character Acer and several other anthropomorphic 1975 AMC Pacers serve as supporting antagonists.

==Legacy==
The AMC Pacer was one of the first American compact cars introduced during the 1970s fuel crisis. It has &quot;inevitable quirks ... it remains a tangible slice of automobile history.&quot; The marketplace was changing and AMC developed an innovative and unconventional design that &quot;collectors often value cars that represent significant moments in automotive history&quot;.

The AMC Pacer is a unique car from the 1970s that became &quot;a cult classic, featured in movies, and a hot item for collectors&quot; and is &quot;one of the most searched cars globally&quot; on the Internet. The Pacer has been described as a &quot;symbol of the future&quot; and has become a special-interest collectible. It is one of the unloved cars from the 1970s that are enjoying a resurgence in collectability. The automobile press at first &quot;loved the Pacer and then they hated it. Now, collectors are looking for pristine original or good restorable examples.&quot;

&quot;Hemmings Motor News&quot; noted that small cars have always played a role in U.S. automotive history, and that &quot;among those produced during the late Seventies, the AMC Pacer was an economical giant, in a manner of speaking.&quot; Now old enough to be a &quot;classic car&quot;, the Pacer has come to be regarded in some quarters as a 1970s design icon. According to &quot;Business Week&quot;, the 1970s were &quot;infamous for disco, Watergate and some of the ugliest cars ever.&quot; The &quot;roly-poly&quot; Pacer was one of the few of that era that had &quot;real personalities&quot; and it embodies a sense of &quot;artful desperation&quot; making it &quot;stand out from the crowd and epitomize at once the best and worst of the seventies&quot;.
According to CNN Money, Pacer values are on the rise. Cars of the 1970s era such as the Pacer are becoming collectors&#x27; items. &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine reported that the rising values of so-called &quot;nerd cars&quot;—ugly 1970s-era cars—prompted the CEO of a major collector-car insurance company to buy a Pacer which has &quot;inexplicably appreciated substantially beyond the $2,300 that he paid for it in 2004.&quot; The innovative AMC Pacers &quot;are finally getting the respect they deserve&quot;. The car has also become recognized by collectors in Europe.

Several national and regional AMC automobile clubs provide owner support. Pacers share the drivetrain as well as some parts and components with other AMC models, while new old stock (NOS), used, and some reproduction parts are available from vendors specializing in AMC vehicles.

<text>Ajeeb was a chess-playing &quot;automaton&quot;, created by Charles Hooper (a cabinet maker), first presented at the Royal Polytechnical Institute in 1868. A piece of faux mechanical technology (while presented as entirely automated, it in fact concealed a strong human chess player inside), it drew scores of thousands of spectators to its games, the opponents for which included Harry Houdini, Theodore Roosevelt, and O. Henry.

Ajeeb&#x27;s name was derived from the Arabic word () meaning &quot;wonderful, marvelous.&quot; The genius behind the device were players such as Harry Nelson Pillsbury (1898–1904), Albert Beauregard Hodges, Constant Ferdinand Burille, Charles Moehle, and Charles Francis Barker. Moehle, for instance, gained further popularity playing chess in the United States, where the contraption was also exhibited in the Eden Museum in 1885 and Coney Island in 1915. Solomon Lipschuetz was one of Ajeeb&#x27;s notable opponents during this period. The machine also played checkers, matching against figures such as 1920s American champ Sam Gonotsky, who would also direct the machine under the ownership of Hattie Elmore.

In the history of such devices, it succeeded the Mechanical Turk and preceded Mephisto.

<text>Henry Goulburn PC FRS (19 March 1784 – 12 January 1856) was a British Conservative and a member of the Peelite faction after 1846.

==Background and education==
Born in London, Goulburn was the eldest son of a wealthy planter, Munbee Goulburn, of Amity Hall, Vere Parish, Jamaica, and his wife Susannah, eldest daughter of William Chetwynd, 4th Viscount Chetwynd. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.

Goulburn lived in Betchworth, Dorking, in Betchworth House for much of his life.

==Sugar plantation owner==
Goulburn&#x27;s inheritance included a number of sugar estates in Jamaica, with Amity Hall in the parish of Vere, now Clarendon Parish, being the most important. Slave labour was still being used to work the sugar plantations when he inherited the estates.

Goulburn never visited Jamaica himself due to his health and political work. He relied on attorneys to manage his estates on his behalf. One attorney, in particular, Thomas Samson, held the top job at the estate from 1802 to 1818 and earned a reputation for cruelty towards Goulburn&#x27;s slaves.

By 1818, the income from his Jamaican estates halved to less than £3,000 &quot;although he did console himself that the condition of his slaves had probably improved&quot;. 

In 1818, Henry Goulburn&#x27;s brother was sent to inspect the Jamaican Sugar Plantation. Thomas Samson had already been dismissed over his treatment of slaves. Henry Goulburn wrote to Samson in June 1818:

==Political career==
=== Chancellor of the Exchequer ===
In 1808, Goulburn became Member of Parliament for Horsham. In 1810, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs, and two and a half years later, he was made Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. It was in this capacity that James Meehan named Goulburn, New South Wales after him, a naming that was ratified by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Still retaining office in the Tory government, he became a Privy Counsellor in 1821, and shortly afterwards was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, a position which he held until April 1827. Here, although he was frequently denounced as he was considered an Orangeman, he had a successful period of office on the whole, and in 1823 he managed to pass the Composition for Tithes (Ireland) Act 1823. In January 1828, he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer under the Duke of Wellington; like his leader, he disliked Roman Catholic emancipation, which he voted against in 1828.

In the finance domain, Goulburn&#x27;s chief achievements were to reduce the interest rate on the part of the national debt and allow anyone to sell beer upon payment of a small annual fee, a complete change of policy about the drink traffic. Leaving office with Wellington in November 1830, Goulburn was Home Secretary under Sir Robert Peel for four months in 1835. When this statesman returned to office in September 1841, he became Chancellor of the Exchequer for the second time. Although Peel himself did some of the chancellor&#x27;s work, Goulburn was responsible for a further reduction in the rate of interest on the national debt, and he aided his chief in the struggle, which ended in the repeal of the Corn Laws. With his colleagues, he left office in June 1846. After representing Horsham in the House of Commons for over four years, Goulburn was successively member for St Germans, for West Looe, and for the city of Armagh. In May 1831, he was elected for Cambridge University, and he retained this seat until his death.

According to the &quot;Legacies of British Slave-Ownership&quot; at the University College London, Goulburn was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a £15 million loan (worth £ in 2025) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). Goulburn was associated with two different claims, he owned 277 slaves in Jamaica and received a £5,601 payment at the time (worth £ in 2025).

Goulburn was a member of the Canterbury Association from 27 March 1848.

==Family==
Frederick Goulburn (1788–1837), the first Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, was his younger brother. Henry Goulburn married the Hon. Jane, third daughter of Matthew Montagu, 4th Baron Rokeby, in 1811. They had four children. He died on 12 January 1856, aged 71. His wife died the following year.
