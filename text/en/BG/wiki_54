<text>Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, officially known as the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King and locally nicknamed &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Wigwam&quot;, is the seat of the Archbishop of Liverpool and the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool in Liverpool, England. The Grade II* Metropolitan Cathedral is one of Liverpool&#x27;s many listed buildings.

The cathedral&#x27;s architect, Frederick Gibberd, was the winner of a worldwide design competition. Construction began in 1962 and was completed in 1967. Earlier designs for a cathedral were proposed in 1933 and 1953, but neither was completed.

==History==

===Pugin&#x27;s design===

During the Great Irish Famine (1845–1852) the Catholic population of Liverpool increased dramatically. About half a million Irish, who were predominantly Catholic, fled to England to escape the famine; many embarked from Liverpool to travel to North America while others remained in the city. Because of the increase in the Catholic population, the co-adjutor Bishop of Liverpool, Alexander Goss (1814–1872), saw the need for a cathedral. The location he chose was the grounds of St. Edward&#x27;s College on St. Domingo Road, Everton.

In 1853 Goss, then bishop, awarded the commission for the building of the new cathedral to Edward Welby Pugin (1833–1875). By 1856 the Lady chapel of the new cathedral had been completed. Due to financial resources being diverted to the education of Catholic children, work on the building ceased at this point and the Lady chapel – now named Our Lady Immaculate – served as parish church to the local Catholic population until its demolition in the 1980s.

===Lutyens&#x27; design===

Following the purchase of the former Brownlow Hill workhouse site in 1930, Sir Edwin Lutyens (1869–1944) was commissioned to provide a design which would be an appropriate response to the Giles Gilbert Scott-designed Neo-gothic Anglican cathedral then partially complete further along Hope Street.

Lutyens&#x27; design was intended to create a massive structure that would have become the second-largest church in the world. It would have had the world&#x27;s largest dome, with a diameter of compared to the diameter on St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City. Building work based on Lutyens&#x27; design began on Whit Monday, 5 June 1933, being paid for mostly by the contributions of working class Catholics of the burgeoning industrial port. In 1941, the restrictions of World War II wartime and a rising cost from £3 million to £27 million (£ in ), forced construction to stop. In 1956, work recommenced on the crypt, which was finished in 1958. Thereafter, Lutyens&#x27; design for the cathedral was considered too costly and was abandoned with only the crypt complete. The restored architectural model of the Lutyens cathedral is on display at the Museum of Liverpool.

===Scott&#x27;s reduced design===
After the ambitious design by Lutyens fell through, Adrian Gilbert Scott, brother of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (architect of the Anglican Cathedral), was commissioned in 1953 to work on a smaller cathedral design with a £4 million budget (£ in ). He proposed a scaled-down version of Lutyens&#x27; building, retaining the massive dome. Scott&#x27;s plans were criticised and the building did not go ahead.

===Gibberd&#x27;s design===
The present Cathedral was designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd (1908–84). Construction began in October 1962 and less than five years later, on the Feast of Pentecost 14 May 1967, the completed cathedral was consecrated. Soon after its opening, it began to exhibit architectural flaws. This led the cathedral authorities to sue Frederick Gibberd for £1.3 million on five counts, the two most serious being leaks in the aluminium roof covering and defects in the mosaic tiles, which had begun to come away from the concrete ribs. The design has been described by Stephen Bayley as &quot;a thin and brittle take on an Oscar Niemeyer original in Brasilia,&quot; though Nikolaus Pevsner notes that the resemblance is only superficial.

==Architecture==

===Concept===
The competition to design the cathedral was held in 1959. The requirement was first, seating for a congregation of 3,000 (later reduced to 2,000) all with direct line of sight to the altar, so they could be more involved in the celebration of the Mass; and, second, for the existing Lutyens crypt to be incorporated in the structure. Gibberd achieved these requirements by designing a circular building with the altar at its centre, and by transforming the roof of the crypt into an elevated platform, with the cathedral standing at one end. The construction contract was let to Taylor Woodrow.

===Exterior===

The cathedral is built in concrete with a Portland stone cladding and an aluminium covering to the roof. Its plan is circular, having a diameter of , with 13 chapels around its perimeter. The shape of the cathedral is conical, and it is surmounted by a tower in the shape of a truncated cone. The building is supported by 16 boomerang-shaped concrete trusses which are held together by two ring beams, one at the bends of the trusses and the other at their tops. Flying buttresses are attached to the trusses, giving the cathedral its tent-like appearance. Rising from the upper ring beam is a lantern tower, containing windows of stained glass, and at its peak is a crown of pinnacles.

The entrance is at the top of a wide flight of steps leading up from Hope Street. Above the entrance is a large wedge-shaped structure. This acts as a bell tower, the four bells being mounted in rectangular orifices towards the top of the tower. Below these is a geometric relief sculpture, designed by William Mitchell, which includes three crosses. To the sides of the entrance doors are more reliefs in fibreglass by Mitchell, which represent the symbols of the Evangelists. The steps which lead up to the cathedral were only completed in 2003, when a building which obstructed the stairway path was acquired and demolished by developers.

A much smaller version of the cathedral, also designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd, was constructed in 1965 as a chapel for the former De La Salle College of Education, Middleton, Lancashire, a Catholic teacher-training college. The site is now occupied by Hopwood Hall College, a further education college of the Borough of Rochdale and the chapel may still be seen.

===Interior===

The focus of the interior is the altar which faces the main entrance. It is made of white marble from Skopje, North Macedonia, and is long. The floor is also of marble in grey and white designed by David Atkins. The benches, concentric with the interior, were designed by Frank Knight. Above is the tower with large areas of stained glass designed by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens in three colours, yellow, blue and red, representing the Trinity. The glass is thick, the pieces of glass being bonded with epoxy resin, in concrete frames. Around the perimeter is a series of chapels. Some of the chapels are open, some are closed by almost blank walls, and others consists of a low space under a balcony. Opposite the entrance is the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, above which is the organ. Other chapels include the Lady Chapel and the Chapel of Saint Joseph. To the right of the entrance is the Baptistry.

On the altar, the candlesticks are by R. Y. Goodden and the bronze crucifix is by Elisabeth Frink. Above the altar is a baldachino designed by Gibberd as a crown-like structure composed of aluminium rods, which incorporates loudspeakers and lights. Around the interior are metal Stations of the Cross, designed by Sean Rice. Rice also designed the lectern, which includes two entwined eagles. In the Chapel of Reconciliation (formerly the Chapel of Saint Paul of the Cross), the stained glass was designed by Margaret Traherne. Stephen Foster designed, carved and painted the panelling in the Chapel of St. Joseph. The Lady Chapel contains a statue of the Virgin and Child by Robert Brumby and stained glass by Margaret Traherne. In the Blessed Sacrament Chapel is a reredos and stained glass by Ceri Richards and a small statue of the Risen Christ by Arthur Dooley. In the Chapel of Unity (formerly the Chapel of Saint Thomas Aquinas) is a bronze stoup by Virginio Ciminaghi, and a mosaic of the Pentecost by Hungarian artist Georg Mayer-Marton which was moved from the Church of the Holy Ghost, Netherton, when it was demolished in 1989. The gates of the Baptistry were designed by David Atkins.

===Architectural problems===
The cathedral was built quickly and economically, and this led to problems with the fabric of the building, including leaks. A programme of repairs was carried out during the 1990s. The building had been faced with mosaic tiles, but these were impossible to repair and were replaced with glass-reinforced plastic, which gave it a thicker appearance. The aluminium in the lantern was replaced by stainless steel, and the slate paving of the platform was replaced with concrete flags.

== Cathedral crypt ==

The crypt under Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral is the only part that was built according to Lutyens&#x27; design before construction stopped due to World War II; in 1962 Frederick Gibberd&#x27;s design was built upon the Lutyens crypt. Structurally the crypt is built of brick together with granite from quarries in Penryn, Cornwall. Each year the crypt plays host to the Liverpool Beer Festival which attracts visitors, not only from all over UK but also Europe and places such as the United States and Australia. The crypt also hosts examinations for students at the University of Liverpool during exam periods.

===Refurbishment===
A £3 million refurbishment of the crypt was completed in 2009 and was officially re-opened on 1 May that year by The Duke of Gloucester. The refurbishment included new east and west approaches, archive provision, rewiring and new lighting, catering facilities, a new chancel, new toilets and revamped exhibitions.

== Organ ==

Built by J. W. Walker and Sons, the organ was completed only two days before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made as an integral part of the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.

===Specifications===
The organ has four manuals, 88 speaking stops and 4565 pipes. It works by way of air pressure, controlled by an electric current and operated by the keys of the organ console; this opens and closes valves within the wind chests, allowing the pipes to speak. This type of motion is called electro-pneumatic action.

<text>Plockton () is a village in the Lochalsh, Wester Ross area of the Scottish Highlands with a 2020 population of 468.

Plockton settlement is on the shores of Loch Carron. It faces east, away from the prevailing winds; this, together with the North Atlantic Drift, gives it a mild climate despite the far-north latitude, allowing the Cordyline australis cabbage tree to prosper.

==History==
Plockton was established as a planned fishing village on the northern edge of the Lochalsh, built &quot;when introducing sheep farming in 1814-20 and removing the population from their old hamlets in Glen Garron, founded the villages of Jeantown and Plockton on Loch Carronside&quot; (Geddes: 1945, pp38). 

A local laird transformed the community into a prosperous fishery, and in the process, funded the planned village. Most of the houses date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Some maritime charts, including MacKenzie (1776) and Heather (1804), mark the peninsula where the village sits as &#x27;Plack&#x27;; however, it is generally considered that the village was built on the &#x27;Ploc&#x27; of Lochalsh, with &#x27;Ploc&#x27; being understood in Gaelic as pimple or bump (of Lochalsh). This usage is shared with other places such as the Plock of Kyle and Plocrapool on the Isle of Harris. Until the end of the eighteenth century, the fishing hamlet, as it was then, was known as &quot;Am Ploc&quot; (meaning &#x27;blunt promontory&#x27; in Gaelic). The ‘-ton’ (from &#x27;town&#x27;) was added to designate it as such in the English language, following the construction of the planned village around 1800.

==Geography==
Situated on a sheltered inlet of Loch Carron, and due to the series of New Zealand cabbage trees which have dominated Harbour Street since the 1960s, Plockton has been described as having a distinctive &quot;sub-tropical appearance&quot;. Most of the land around Plockton is within the Balmacara Estate, owned by the National Trust for Scotland.

Plockton lies about 10km (6miles) northeast of Kyle of Lochalsh, and is reached by road along single-track roads that go between Kyle of Lochalsh on the A87, and Achmore on the A890.

==Tourism==
The village is a tourist resort, often having many tourists and day-trippers in peak season. It has been deemed &quot;arguably the prettiest village in the highlands&quot;. The television series &quot;Hamish Macbeth&quot;, starring Robert Carlyle, was filmed there, substituting for the fictional &quot;Lochdubh&quot;. Plockton was also used for various scenes in the film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; and the Inspector Alleyn Mysteries television series.

==Facilities==
The village has a small general store with a café; a takeaway; a restaurant; newsagent and craft shop; three hotels with pubs; numerous B&amp;Bs; library with free internet access and a village hall, which holds community events and art exhibitions. The Church of Scotland house of worship in the village, also used by the Free Church of Scotland, was designed by Thomas Telford. The village is served by Plockton railway station, on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line, and the short Plockton Airfield, operated by the Highland Council, is for light aircraft and microlights.

Nearby is Duncraig Castle, a nineteenth-century stately home built by the Matheson family. The castle was derelict for many years, having had a variety of commercial uses.

Plockton has been a popular location for many artists including those from The Edinburgh School (Adam Bruce Thomson, David Macbeth Sutherland) and continues to attract artists.

==Education==

Plockton is home to Sgoil Chiùil na Gàidhealtachd - the National Centre For Excellence in Traditional Music at Plockton High School, which also serves the village and a wide surrounding area. The school also hosts the Am Bàta project, teaching pupils in the art of boat building, from which a number of &#x27;local&#x27; style boats have been produced. Some have been donated to the local sailing club - Plockton Small Boat Sailing Club - whilst others have been sold to the public. Plockton was home between 1956 and 1972 to the Gaelic scholar Sorley MacLean, (Somhairle MacGill-Eain) whilst headmaster at the high school, who introduced the teaching of Gaelic and championed shinty.

Since 1991 Plockton Primary School has accommodated a Gaelic-medium education unit (GMU), where instruction is through the medium of Gaelic. 24.4% of the population in the catchment area of Plockton Primary School reports being able to speak Gaelic – the highest incidence of Gaelic-speaking on the mainland of Scotland.

==Football club==
From 1954 the village played host to Plockton Amateur Football Club. However, from 2016, the club has been in abeyance. Plockton FC played at the &quot;Alasdair Ross Memorial Park&quot; and competed in yellow and black strips - reflected in their &quot;Bumble Bees&quot; nickname. They were formerly members of the West Highland Amateur Football Association.

== Media ==
==Climate==
The Met Office operates a weather station at Plockton, for which 30 year averages are available. As with the rest of the British Isles, Plockton experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The highest temperature was 27.7 °C recorded on 9 May 2016, and the lowest was –9.8 °C.

<text>Frederick Bates (June 23, 1777 – August 4, 1825), was an American attorney and politician. He was elected in 1824 as the second governor of Missouri and died in office in 1825. Before that he had served as a justice of the Territorial Supreme Court for Michigan Territory, was appointed by Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of the Louisiana Territory and started to build his political base in St. Louis.

==Early life and education==
Frederick Bates was born in 1777 into the slave-holding class in Goochland County, Virginia. Though a Quaker, Bates and his family were lifelong slaveholders. Bates was schooled privately at his family&#x27;s Belmont plantation by tutors. Later he went to college and read the law with an established firm. He settled in Detroit in 1797 and became its first postmaster in 1803. He was a member of the Bates family along with his brothers Edward and James Woodson Bates.

==Career==
After working as an attorney, Bates started his political career when appointed as a justice of the Territorial Supreme Court for Michigan Territory in Detroit. He received a significant promotion when the Aaron Burr conspiracy was uncovered. In February 1807, while Bates was in Washington, President Thomas Jefferson appointed him to be Secretary of the Louisiana Territory, as well as a recorder of land titles. As secretary, he was also commander in chief of the militia. He held this position in St. Louis until 1812. Bates helped determine whether conflicting French, Spanish, and American land claims in the territory would be upheld, as it had been subject to three differing political systems.

Jefferson had already decided on the returning explorer and fellow Virginian Meriwether Lewis as governor of the huge new Louisiana Territory, which approximately equaled the size of the existing United States. Bates preceded Lewis to St. Louis and became a powerful political force in the new territory; he was a political rival of Lewis until the latter&#x27;s death while traveling from St. Louis to Washington on business in 1809. Later, as Secretary of the newly formed Missouri Territory (1812–1821), he became acting governor in the frequent absences of Territorial Governor William Clark.

In the August 1824 election, Bates was elected the second governor of Missouri. He died in office in August 1825 in Chesterfield, Missouri, due to a short illness thought to be pneumonia. Bates was buried at the family cemetery on the Thornhill estate near St. Louis.

==Marriage and family==

In 1819, Bates married Nancy Opie Ball (1802–1877), daughter of a wealthy Virginia colonel. The couple had four children, Emily Caroline (1820–1891), Lucius Lee (1821–1898), Woodville (1823–1840) and Frederick Jr. (1826–1862).

During his time in Missouri, Bates acquired nearly 1000 acres (4 km2) of land, which he called Thornhill. He also acquired several enslaved men, women, and children. He had built a Federal-style home with high ceilings for summer ventilation, fine woodwork and a sophisticated floor plan; all this would have been familiar to Bates from his childhood home, Belmont, in Goochland County, Virginia. The Thornhill estate still exists today and can be viewed by the public. It is located in Faust County Park in Chesterfield, Missouri.

==Legacy and honors==
Governor Bates is the namesake of Bates County, Missouri.

<doc id="315504" wikidata="Q1240937" url="?curid=315504" title="Inō Tadataka">
<text>was a Japanese surveyor and cartographer. He is known for completing the first map of Japan using modern surveying techniques.

==Early life==
Inō was born in the small village of Ozeki in the middle of Kujūkuri beach, in Kazusa Province (in what is now Chiba Prefecture). He was born to the Jimbō family and his childhood name was Sanjirō. His mother died when he was seven and after a somewhat tumultuous childhood (not uncommon at the time), he was adopted (age 17) by the prosperous Inō family of Sawara (now a district of Katori, Chiba), a town in Shimōsa Province. He ran the family business, expanding its &quot;sake&quot; brewing and rice-trading concerns, until he retired at the age of 49.

After retirement, he moved to Edo and became a pupil of astronomer Takahashi Yoshitoki, from whom he learned Western astronomy, geography, and mathematics.

==Mission==

In 1800, after nearly five years of study, the Tokugawa shogunate authorized Inō to perform a survey of the country using his own money. This task, which consumed the remaining 17 years of his life, covered the entire coastline and some of the interior of each of the Japanese home islands. During this period Inō reportedly spent 3,736 days making measurements (and traveled 34,913 kilometres), stopping regularly to present the Shōgun with maps reflecting his survey&#x27;s progress. He produced detailed maps (some at a scale of 1:36,000, others at 1:216,000) of select parts of Japan, mostly in Kyūshū and Hokkaidō.

Inō&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, his 1:216,000 map of the entire coastline of Japan, remained unfinished at his death in 1818 but was completed by his surveying team in 1821. An atlas collecting all of his survey work, &quot;Dai Nihon Enkai Yochi Zenzu&quot; (:ja:大日本沿海輿地全図 &quot;Maps of Japan&#x27;s Coastal Area&quot;), was published that year. It had three pages of large-scale maps at 1:432,000, showed the entire country on eight pages at 1:216,000, and had 214 pages of select coastal areas in fine detail at 1:36,000. The &quot;Inō-zu&quot; (Inō&#x27;s maps), many of which are accurate to 1/1000  of a degree, remained the definitive maps of Japan for nearly a century, and maps based on his work were in use as late as 1924.

==Expeditions==

Inō&#x27;s surveys were done in ten expeditions. The first survey started on June 11, 1800 and included five members. This survey was mainly to begin charting the coast of Hokkaidō (where Russian ships had come to open trading houses). This survey was done almost entirely by measuring walking steps and taking astronomical observations. They made it to Bekkai 別解 in far northeast Hokkaido. In total they walked and surveyed 3,244 km.

The results of the first survey, paid for almost entirely by Inō&#x27;s own funds, helped the shogunal government understand the significance of the work. For this reason, starting with the second expedition (departing Edo in the summer of 1801) he received more support, and the route was more ambitious, covering most of the eastern seaboard from just south of Edo to the far northern tip of Honshū, and then the interior portion on the return trip. This expedition lasted approximately six months and covered 3,122 km.

After the second survey, more and more trust was put in Inō&#x27;s endeavor. By the fifth expedition, there were 19 people involved, they covered almost 7,000 km. On the 8th expedition they covered over 13,000 km in 914 days, most of it in Kyūshū. By this time Inō was 70 years old, which was decades older than the average lifespan at that time.

In addition to his maps, Inō produced scholarly works on surveying and mathematics, including &quot;Chikyū sokuenjutsu mondō&quot; and &quot;Kyūkatsuen hassenhō&quot;.

==Commemoration==
In November 1995 the Japanese government issued a commemorative 80 yen postage stamp, showing Inō&#x27;s portrait and a section of his map of Edo.

Most of the complete copies of the atlas have been lost or destroyed (often by fire), although a mostly-complete copy of the large-scale map was discovered in the collection of the U.S. Library of Congress in 2001.

After his death, Inō was one of 37 people honored at the Hokkaidō Shrine as &quot;kami&quot; associated with the pioneering efforts of the Japanese government to settle and develop Hokkaidō.

Inō Tadataka&#x27;s grave is located at the temple of Genkū-ji in Taitō-ku, Tokyo. The grave was designated a National Historic Site in 1928.

==Inō Tadataka Former Residence==
Inō&#x27;s home in Sawara still exists, and is located on the bank of the Ono River that flows through the city of Katori. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1930. The building was constructed in the Edo period and is a complex consisting of a gate, main building, and attached kitchen, library and &quot;kura&quot; warehouse. The buildings are all tiled, and the main building has five rooms. The Inō family ranked as one of Sawara&#x27;s leading families. Inō lived at this location from the time he was adopted at the age of 17 in 1762 until his retirement and relocation to Edo at the age of 50. However, the existing building dates from 1793, when Inō was 48 years old, so he only actually lived in this structure for two years. The building was previously used as the , but this has now been relocated to a new building on the opposite side of the street.

<text>Ishida Mitsunari (, 1559 – November 6, 1600) was a Japanese samurai and military commander of the late Sengoku period of Japan. He is probably best remembered as the commander of the Western army in the Battle of Sekigahara following the Azuchi–Momoyama period of the 16th century. He is also known by his court title, Jibu-no-shō .

== Biography ==
Mitsunari was born in 1559 at the north of Ōmi Province (which is now Nagahama city, Shiga Prefecture), and was the second son of Ishida Masatsugu, who was a retainer for the Azai clan. His childhood name was Sakichi (). The Ishida withdrew from service after the Azai&#x27;s defeat in 1573 at the Siege of Odani Castle. According to legend, he was a monk in a Buddhist temple before he served Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but the accuracy of this legend is doubted since it only came about during the Edo period.

In 1577, Mitsunari met Toyotomi Hideyoshi, when the former was still young and the latter was the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Nagahama. Later, Mitsunari became a Hideyoshi samurai officer. When Hideyoshi engaged in a campaign in the Chūgoku region, Mitsunari assisted his lord in attacks against castles like the Tottori Castle and Takamatsu Castle (in present-day Okayama).

In 1583, Mitsunari participated in the Battle of Shizugatake. According to the &quot;Hitotsuyanagi Kaki&quot;, he was in charge of a mission to spy on Shibata Katsuie&#x27;s army and also performed a great feat of Ichiban-yari (being the first to thrust a spear at an enemy soldier) as one of the warriors on the front line. Later, he served in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584. That same year, he worked as a &quot;kenchi&quot; (survey magistrate) at Gamo county in Omi Province.
In 1585, Mitsunari was appointed as administrator of Sakai, a role he took together with his elder brother Ishida Masazumi. He was appointed one of the five bugyō, or top administrators of Hideyoshi&#x27;s government, along with Asano Nagamasa, Maeda Gen&#x27;i, Mashita Nagamori and Natsuka Masaie. Hideyoshi made him a &quot;daimyō&quot; of Sawayama in Ōmi Province, a five hundred thousand koku fief (now a part of Hikone). Sawayama Castle was known as one of the best-fortified castles during that time. In January 1586, he hired Shima Sakon, who was renowned as a commander having wisdom and courage.

In 1588, Mitsunari was placed in charge of the famed “sword hunt” conducted by Hideyoshi in an effort to disarm the non-military bulk of the population and preserve peace.

In 1590, he campaigned against the Hōjō clan, where he commanded the Siege of Oshi and captured Oshi Castle. 

In 1592, Mitsunari participated in the Japanese invasions of Korea as one of the Three Bureaucrats with Mashita Nagamori and Asano Nagamasa.

In 1597, Mitsunari was ordered by Hideyoshi to persecute Christians. However, he showed sympathy to Christianity by minimising the number of Christians he arrested, and trying hard to appease Hideyoshi&#x27;s anger (see 26 Martyrs of Japan). In the same year, Mitsunari also reportedly worked to end the war with Korea and China.

=== Sekigahara Campaign and death ===

Mitsunari had high status among the bureaucrats of Hideyoshi&#x27;s government, and was known for his unbending character. He had many friends; two of the most notable being the famous samurai Ōtani Yoshitsugu and Shima Sakon. However, Mitsunari was on bad terms with some &quot;daimyō&quot; that were known as good warriors, including Kuroda Nagamasa and Hachisuka Iemasa, as well as Hideyoshi&#x27;s nephew Kobayakawa Hideaki. In particular, Kobayakawa Hideaki developed a grudge against Mitsunari as a result of rumors spread by Tokugawa Ieyasu that Mitsunari was behind his uncle&#x27;s decision not to reward him with Chikugo after Kobayakawa&#x27;s reckless behaviour at the Siege of Ulsan. Toward the end of Taiko Hideyoshi&#x27;s life, Hideyoshi ordered the execution of his heir and nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu and Hidetsugu&#x27;s family, leaving his new heir to be the extremely young child, Toyotomi Hideyori. 

After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, the conflicts in the court worsened. The central point of the conflict was the question of whether Tokugawa Ieyasu could be relied on as a supporter of the Toyotomi government, whose nominal lord was still a child, with actual leadership falling to a council of regents. After the death of the respected &quot;neutral&quot; Maeda Toshiie in 1599, the conflict came to arms, with Mitsunari forming an alliance of Toyotomi loyalists to stand against Tokugawa Ieyasu. Mitsunari&#x27;s support came largely from the three of Hideyoshi&#x27;s regents: Ukita Hideie, Mōri Terumoto, and Uesugi Kagekatsu, who came from the south and west of Japan, with the addition of the Uesugi clan in the north. Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s support came from central and eastern Japan, but he still exercised influence and intimidation over some of the Western lords. The titular head of the Western alliance was Mōri Terumoto, but Mōri stayed entrenched in Osaka castle; the leadership fell to Mitsunari in the field.

In mid 1600, the campaign began. Mitsunari besieged Fushimi Castle before marching into direct conflict with Tokugawa&#x27;s alliance at Sekigahara. In October 21, at the Battle of Sekigahara, a number of lords stayed neutral, watching the battle from afar, not wishing to join in the losing side. Tokugawa&#x27;s forces gained the edge in the battle with the betrayal of Kobayakawa Hideaki to their side, and won the battle.

After his defeat at Sekigahara, Mitsunari sought to escape but was caught by villagers. He was beheaded in Kyoto. Other &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Western army, like Konishi Yukinaga and Ankokuji Ekei were also executed. After execution, his head, severed from his body, was placed on a stand for all the people in Kyoto to see. His remains were buried at Sangen-in, a sub-temple of the Daitoku-ji, Kyoto.

A legend says that Ieyasu showed him mercy but hid him, for political reasons, with one of his veteran generals, Sakakibara Yasumasa, where he grew old and died of natural causes. To thank Yasumasa for his silence, Mitsunari gave him a tantō nicknamed &quot;Ishida Sadamune&quot; (石田貞宗) – a National Treasure of Japan.

== Personal life ==
Mitsunari had three sons (Shigeie, Shigenari, and Sakichi) and three daughters (only the younger girl&#x27;s name is known, Tatsuhime) with his wife. After his father&#x27;s death, Shigenari changed his family name to Sugiyama to keep living.

Sawayama Castle was a castle which was controlled by the Ishida clan. When the castle captured by the Eastern army after the Sekigahara battle ended and after Mitsunari died, it was reported by a Tokugawa vassal named Itasaka Bokusai who entered the castle that there was not a single piece of gold or silver kept by Ishida Mitsunari there.

=== Mitsunari as military commander ===
According to Asano clan Documents, there is popular belief that Mitsunari&#x27;s reputation as military commander were suffered badly due to the alleged bad performance during the Siege of Oshi, particularly his failed strategy to flood the castle to force the defender to submit. However, other records based on documented correspondence of the operation have stated that the water flooding attack was actually an instruction from Toyotomi Hideyoshi himself, which was relayed by Asano Nagamasa and Kimura Shigekore, while Mitsunari only executed the strategy and actually did not have freedom to devise his own initiatives.

Stephen Turnbull stated that traditional Japanese historiography did not pay much attention to Mitsunari&#x27;s legacy, as he lost and Tokugawa won; he was often portrayed as a weak bureaucrat. His reputation has somewhat recovered since then, with later historians note his skill in planning and earlier battlefield victories, and that Sekigahara could easily have gone his way had a few more lords remained loyal.

=== Conflict with military faction ===
According to popular theory, in 1598, after the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the government of Japan had an accident when seven military generals consisting of Fukushima Masanori, Katō Kiyomasa, Ikeda Terumasa, Hosokawa Tadaoki, Asano Yoshinaga, Katō Yoshiaki, and Kuroda Nagamasa planned a conspiracy to kill Ishida Mitsunari. However, despite the traditional depiction of the event as &quot;seven generals against Mitsunari&quot;, modern historian Watanabe Daimon has pointed out that actually there were more generals involved in conflict against Mitsunari, such as Hachisuka Iemasa, Tōdō Takatora, and Kuroda Yoshitaka who also brought their troops and entourage to confront Mitsunari.

It was said that the reason behind this conspiracy was dissatisfaction of those generals towards Mitsunari as he wrote poor assessments and underreported their achievements during the Japanese invasions of Korea, while some like Tadaoki also accused Mitsunari of other mismanagement during his tenure under Hideyoshi. At first, these generals gathered at Kiyomasa&#x27;s mansion in Osaka Castle, and from there they marched to Mitsunari&#x27;s mansion. However, Mitsunari had learned of this from a report by a servant of Toyotomi Hideyori named Jiemon Kuwajima, and fled to Satake Yoshinobu&#x27;s mansion together with Shima Sakon and others to hide. When the seven generals found out that Mitsunari was not in his mansion, they searched the mansions of various feudal lords in Osaka Castle, and Kato&#x27;s army also approached the Satake residence. Mitsunari and his party escaped from the Satake residence and barricaded themselves at Fushimi Castle. The next day, the seven generals surrounded Fushimi Castle with their soldiers as they knew Mitsunari was hiding there. Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was in charge of political affairs in Fushimi Castle attempted to arbitrate the situation. The seven generals requested Ieyasu to hand over Mitsunari, which Ieyasu refused. Ieyasu then negotiated a promise to let Mitsunari retire and to review the assessment of the Battle of Ulsan Castle in Korea which had been a major source of this incident. He also had his second son, Yūki Hideyasu, to escort Mitsunari to Sawayama Castle.

However, historians like Daimon, Junji Mitsunari, and Goki Mizuno have pointed out from the primary and secondary sources text about the accident that this was more of legal conflict between those generals and Mitsunari, rather than conspiracy to assassinate him. The role of Ieyasu here was not to physically protect Mitsunari from physical harm, but to mediate the legal complaints from the military faction figures who had a problem with Mitsunari. Considering these facts, a more proper term to describe this incident is &quot;the military generals&#x27; lawsuit against Mitsunari&quot;, rather than &quot;Seven generals&#x27; conspiracy to kill Mitsunari&quot;.

Nevertheless, historians viewed this incident not just as simply personal problems between those generals and Mitsunari, but rather as an extension of the political rivalries of greater scope between the Tokugawa faction and the anti-Tokugawa faction led by Mitsunari. Since this incident, those military figures who were on bad terms with Mitsunari would later support Ieyasu during the conflict of Sekigahara between the Eastern army led by Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Western army led by Ishida Mitsunari. Muramatsu Shunkichi, writer of &quot;&quot;The Surprising Colors and Desires of the Heroes of Japanese History and violent women&quot;”, gave his assessment that the reason of Mitsunari failed in his war against Ieyasu was due to his unpopularity among the major political figures of that time.

=== Political rivalry with Ieyasu ===
For long time, the prevailing opinion about the cause of the Sekigahara war between Mitsunari and Ieyasu was that it was caused by the enmity between them. However, this view was challenged by Tonooka Shin&#x27;ichirō, a professor at Nara University and director of the Tsuruga City museum, as Shin&#x27;ichirō viewed the political maneuvers which led to the conflict in Sekigahara as being solely based on Mitsunari&#x27;s motivation to regain his political position after the coup of military factions which stripped him of his position and had nothing to do with Ieyasu at personal level.

== Legacy ==

On May 19, 1907, a group of Japanese researchers planned an excavation of Mitsunari&#x27;s grave with the cooperation of a local newspaper. This was meant to aid Sesuke Watanabe from Tokyo Imperial University, who was writing a biography on Mitsunari. The one who led and examined the remains of Mitsunari was archaeologist Buntarō Adachi. Adachi restored Mitsunari&#x27;s damaged skull, made a plaster cast, and recorded measurements of his upper arm bone and other bones. In 1943, a student of Adachi, Kenji Seino took further investigation, relying on photographs of Mitsunari&#x27;s remains to conduct interviews with Adachi. When Seino completed his investigation, he discovered that Mitsunari&#x27;s head was long from front to back and he had crooked teeth, and it was estimated that Mitsunari&#x27;s age at the time of his death was about 41. Furthermore, Seino had reported his finding that based on the skeleton, it was difficult to distinguish the skeleton&#x27;s gender. Seino also reported that the height of Mitsunari was estimated to be 156 centimeters. After the investigation, a plaster statue and other specimens of Mitsunari were preserved at Kyoto Imperial University, and his remains were reburied. 

The katana nicknamed Ishida Masamune, made by the master swordsmith Masamune, was formerly owned by Ishida Mitsunari. It is an Important Cultural Property according to the Agency for Cultural Affairs, and is held in the Tokyo National Museum.

The Tantō &quot;Hyūga Masamune&quot;, also made by Masamune, was also in the possession of Ishida Mitsunari. He gave this sword to Fukuhara Nagatake [the husband of his younger sister]; the sword was taken by Eastern army general named Mizuno Katsushige after the Western army defeated battle of Sekigahara. It is a National Treasure of Japan, and is currently held in the Mitsui Memorial Museum.

<text>[[Count]] was a Japanese politician. He was a leader of the &quot;Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement&quot; and founded Japan&#x27;s first political party, the Liberal Party.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

Itagaki Taisuke was born into a middle-ranking &quot;samurai&quot; family in Tosa Domain, (present day Kōchi Prefecture), After studies in Kōchi and in Edo, he was appointed as &quot;sobayonin&quot; (councillor) to Tosa &quot;daimyō&quot; Yamauchi Toyoshige, and was in charge of accounts and military matters at the domain&#x27;s Edo residence in 1861. He disagreed with the domain&#x27;s official policy of &quot;kōbu gattai&quot; (reconciliation between the Imperial Court and the Tokugawa shogunate), and in 1867–1868, he met with Saigō Takamori of the Satsuma Domain, and agreed to pledge Tosa&#x27;s forces in the effort to overthrow the &quot;shōgun&quot; in the upcoming Meiji Restoration. During the Boshin War, he emerged as the principal political figure from Tosa domain as a leader of the Jinshotai assault force, and claimed a place in the new Meiji government after the Tokugawa defeat.

=== Meiji statesman to liberal agitator ===
Itagaki was appointed a Councilor of State in 1869, and was involved in several key reforms, such as the abolition of the han system in 1871. As a &quot;sangi&quot; (councillor), he ran the government temporarily during the absence of the Iwakura Mission.
However, Itagaki resigned from the Meiji government in 1873 over disagreement with the government&#x27;s policy of restraint toward Korea &quot;(Seikanron)&quot; and, more generally, in opposition to the Chōshū-Satsuma domination of the new government.

In 1874, together with Gotō Shōjirō of Tosa and Etō Shinpei and Soejima Taneomi of Hizen, he formed the &quot;Aikoku Kōtō&quot; (Public Party of Patriots), declaring, &quot;We, the thirty millions of people in Japan are all equally endowed with certain definite rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring and possessing property, and obtaining a livelihood and pursuing happiness. These rights are by Nature bestowed upon all men, and, therefore, cannot be taken away by the power of any man.&quot; This anti-government stance appealed to the discontented remnants of the &quot;samurai&quot; class and the rural aristocracy (who resented centralized taxation) and peasants (who were discontented with high prices and low wages). Itagaki&#x27;s involvement in liberalism lent it political legitimacy in Japan, and he became a leader of the push for democratic reform.

Itagaki and his associations created a variety of organizations to fuse &quot;samurai&quot; ethos with western liberalism and to agitate for a national assembly, written constitution and limits to arbitrary exercise of power by the government. These included the &quot;Risshisha&quot; (Self-Help Movement) and the &quot;Aikokusha&quot; (Society of Patriots) in 1875. After funding issues led to initial stagnation, the &quot;Aikokusha&quot; was revived in 1878 and agitated with increasing success as part of the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement. The Movement drew the ire of the government and its supporters.

=== Leadership of the Liberal Party ===


Government leaders met at the Osaka Conference of 1875, to which seven schools created under Itagaki&#x27;s influence sent delegations, and the various delegates entered into an agreement by which they pledged themselves to the principle of a constitutional monarchy and a legislative assembly. They enticed Itagaki to return as a &quot;sangi&quot; (councilor): however, he resigned after a couple of months to oppose what he viewed as excessive concentration of power in the Genrōin. Itagaki criticized the government at the same time as it was under threat by the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion, which turned the cabinet against him. Legislation was then created restraining free speech and association.

In response, Itagaki created the Liberal Party (Jiyuto) together with Numa Morikazu in 1881, which, along with the &quot;Rikken Kaishintō&quot;, led the nationwide popular discontent of 1880–1884. During this period, a rift developed in the movement between the lower class members and the aristocratic leadership of the party. Itagaki became embroiled in controversy when he took a trip to Europe believed by many to have been funded by the government. The trip turned out to have been provided by the Mitsui Company, but suspicions that Itagaki was being won over to the government side persisted. Consequently, radical splinter groups proliferated, undermining the unity of the party and the Movement. Itagaki was offered the title of Count (&quot;Hakushaku&quot;) in 1884, as the new peerage system known as &quot;kazoku&quot; was formed, but he accepted only on the condition that the title not be passed on to his heirs. In 1882, Itagaki was almost assassinated by a right-wing militant, to whom he allegedly said, &quot;Itagaki may die, but liberty never!&quot;

The Liberal Party dissolved itself on 29 October 1884. It was reestablished shortly before the opening of the Imperial Diet in 1890 as the Rikken Jiyūtō.

In April 1896, Itagaki joined the second Itō administration as Home Minister. In 1898, Itagaki joined with Ōkuma Shigenobu of the Shimpotō to form the Kenseitō, and Japan&#x27;s first party government. Ōkuma became Prime Minister, and Itagaki continued serving as Home Minister. The Cabinet collapsed after four months of squabbling between the factions, demonstrating the immaturity of parliamentary democracy at the time in Japan.
Itagaki retired from public life in 1900 and spent the rest of his days writing. He died of natural causes in 1919.

=== After Liberal Party ===
In the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement in Okinawa, Itagaki supported Jahana Noboru. In the Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament, Itagaki and Lin Hsien-tang established The Taiwan Assimilation Society in 1914. Itagaki Taisuke was sympathetic to the colonial policy in Taiwan toward the Taiwanese people and insisted that the rights and treatment of Taiwanese be the same as those of the Japanese and that discrimination be eliminated.

=== Legacy ===
Itagaki is credited as being the first Japanese party leader and an important force for liberalism in Meiji Japan. His portrait has appeared on the 50-sen and 100-yen banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan.

<text>Total player rating (TPR), also known as Batter-Fielder/Pitcher Wins (BFW/PW) is a metric for measuring the value of baseball players, and to enable players to be compared against each other even when they played for different teams, at different positions, and in different eras. It was developed by sabermetrician Pete Palmer and was popularized in the &quot;Total Baseball&quot; series of encyclopedias during the 1980s.

Total player rating is computed using linear weights, in which each event in a baseball game (for instance, a base on balls, a double or a stolen base) is assigned a value in runs. Each player then has a rating in Batting Runs, Pitching Runs, and Fielding Runs, usually adjusted for park and position, and the sum of these values is divided by 10 and is expressed as an offset in games from an &quot;average&quot; baseball player. Thus, a star player in a season might have been worth 6 games more than an average player, while a scrub might be 5 games below average. The justification for representing a game as 10 runs was determined empirically and varied by era, but 10 was the rule of thumb for back-of-the-envelope computations, e.g. for fans comparing players using runs created.

TPR helped disseminate the notion that players should not be given credit for events over which they have no control. As an example which embraces giving such credit, the runs batted in (RBI) statistic awards a hitter with runs which scored when he collected a hit or a walk, even though the player has no control over whether the players who batted before him got on base, which is a significant influence on whether he is able to drive them in. Thus, players with high RBI totals for a season may have such not because they&#x27;re among the best hitters themselves, but because they hit behind players who are among the best at getting on base.

In the 1990s, some criticisms of TPR prompted other sabermetricians to develop new methods of measuring player value, such as equivalent average and value over replacement player. Bill James presented some of these criticisms in his book &quot;Win Shares&quot;, foremost among them being the observation that an average player has a TPR value of 0, whereas in fact an average player has substantial positive value.

<text>Anton Stepanovich Arensky (; – ) was a Russian composer of Romantic classical music, a pianist and a professor of music.

==Biography==
Arensky was born into an affluent, music-loving family in Novgorod, Russia. He was musically precocious and had composed a number of songs and piano pieces by the age of nine. With his mother and father, he moved to Saint Petersburg in 1879, after which he studied composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

After graduating from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1882, Arensky became a professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Among his students there were Alexander Scriabin, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Alexander Gretchaninov.

In 1895, Arensky returned to Saint Petersburg as the director of the Imperial Choir, a post for which he had been recommended by Mily Balakirev. He retired from this position in 1901, living off a comfortable pension and spending his remaining time as a pianist, conductor, and composer.

Arensky died of tuberculosis in a sanatorium in Perkjärvi, in what was then the Russian-administered Grand Duchy of Finland, at the age of 44. While very little is known about his private life, Rimsky-Korsakov alleges that drinking and gambling undermined his health. He was buried in the Tikhvin Cemetery.

The Antarctic Arensky Glacier was named after him.

==Music==

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was the greatest influence on Arensky&#x27;s musical compositions. Indeed, Rimsky-Korsakov said, &quot;In his youth, Arensky did not escape some influence from me; later, the influence came from Tchaikovsky. He will quickly be forgotten.&quot; The perception that he lacked a distinctive personal style contributed to long-term neglect of his music, though in recent years, a large number of his compositions have been recorded. Especially popular are the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Tchaikovsky&quot; for string orchestra, Op. 35a - arranged from the slow movement of Arensky&#x27;s 2nd string quartet, and based on one of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Children&quot;, Op. 54.

Arensky was, perhaps, at his best in the genre of chamber music, in which he wrote two string quartets, two piano trios, and a piano quintet.

<text>Marcel Ophuls (; born 1 November 1927) is a German-French documentary film maker and former actor, best known for his films &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot; and &quot;Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Ophuls was born in Frankfurt, Germany, the son of Hildegard Wall and the director Max Ophüls. His family left Germany in 1933 following the coming to power of the Nazi Party and settled in Paris, France. Following the invasion of France by Germany in May 1940 they were forced to flee to the Vichy zone, remaining in hiding for over a year before crossing the Pyrenees into Spain in order to travel to the United States, arriving there in December 1941. Marcel attended Hollywood High School, then Occidental College, Los Angeles. He spent a brief period serving in a U.S. Army theatrical unit in Japan in 1946, then studied at the University of California, Berkeley. Ophuls became a naturalized citizen of France in 1938, and of the United States in 1950.

When the family returned to Paris in 1950 Marcel became an assistant to Julien Duvivier and Anatole Litvak, and worked on John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952) and his father&#x27;s &quot;Lola Montès&quot; (1955). Through François Truffaut, Ophuls got to direct an episode of the portmanteau film &quot;Love at Twenty&quot; (1962). There followed the commercial hit &quot;Banana Peel&quot; (1964), a detective film starring Jeanne Moreau and Jean-Paul Belmondo.

With a slump in box-office fortunes, Ophuls turned to television news reporting and a documentary on the Munich crisis of 1938: &quot;Munich&quot; (1967). He then embarked on his examination of France under Nazi occupation, &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot;. Although he enjoyed making entertaining films, Ophuls became identified as a documentarian, using a characteristically sober interview style to resolve disparate experiences into a persuasive argument. &quot;A Sense of Loss&quot; (1972) looked at Northern Ireland, and &quot;The Memory of Justice&quot; (1973) was an ambitious comparison of US policy in Vietnam and the atrocities of the Nazis. Disagreements with his French backers over interpretation led Ophuls to smuggle a print to New York where it was shown privately. Legal wrangles left him disappointed and financially broke, and Ophuls turned to university lecturing.

In the mid-1970s, he began producing documentaries for CBS and ABC. His feature documentary &quot;Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie&quot; (1988) won an Academy Award; since then he has made an interview film with two senior East German Communists, &quot;November Days&quot; (1992) and a ruminative look at how journalists cover war, &quot;The Trouble We&#x27;ve Seen&quot; (1994).

Every year the IDFA (International Documentary Festival) in Amsterdam screens an acclaimed filmmaker&#x27;s ten favorite films. In 2007, Iranian filmmaker Maziar Bahari selected &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot; for his top ten classics from the history of documentary. At the 65th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2015 Ophuls received the Berlinale Camera award for his life work.

In 2014, Ophuls began crowd-sourcing funds for his new film &quot;Unpleasant Truths&quot;, about the continuing Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, to be co-directed with Israeli filmmaker Eyal Sivan. In part, the film seeks to focus on possible links between the 2014 Israeli war on Gaza and the rise in anti-Semitism in Europe as well as whether &quot;Islamophobia is the new anti-Semitism.&quot; It was originally intended as a collaboration with Jean-Luc Godard, who backed out early in the process; Godard makes an appearance as himself in the film. As of 2017, the film had not yet been completed due to unspecified financial and legal troubles, and may not be finished ever.

==Umlaut==
Marcel, like his father Max, prefers not to use the German umlaut in his name. Ophuls senior removed the umlaut when he took French citizenship, and Marcel has adopted the same spelling.

<doc id="315537" wikidata="Q721644" url="?curid=315537" title="Da capo aria">
<text>The da capo aria () is a musical form for arias that was prevalent in the Baroque era. It is sung by a soloist with the accompaniment of instruments, often a small orchestra. The da capo aria is very common in the musical genres of opera and oratorio. According to Randel, a number of Baroque composers (he lists Scarlatti, Hasse, Handel, Porpora, Leo, and Vinci) composed more than a thousand da capo arias during their careers.

==Form==
A da capo aria is in ternary form, meaning it is composed of three sections. The first section is a complete song with accompaniment, ending in the tonic key, and could in principle be sung by itself. The second section contrasts with the first in its musical key, texture, mood, and sometimes also tempo. The third section was usually not written out by the composer, who would instead simply note the instruction &quot;da capo&quot; (Italian for &quot;from the head&quot;) - meaning from the beginning, i.e., the first section is to be repeated.

The text for a da capo aria was typically a poem or other verse sequence written in two strophes, the first for the A section (hence repeated later) and the second for B. Each strophe consisted of from three to six lines, and terminated in a line containing a masculine ending, that is a line ending in a stressed syllable.

==Improvisation==
The singer was often expected to improvise variations and ornaments during the third section, to keep it from being a mere repetition of the first. This was especially so for da capo arias written in slower tempos, where the opportunity to improvise, as well as the risk of dullness, were greater. The ability to improvise variations and ornaments was a skill learned by, and expected of, all solo singers. The decline in this ability following the Baroque era is perhaps the reason why the da capo aria ultimately acquired a reputation as a musically dull form. The authentic performance movement, starting in the mid twentieth century, restored improvisation to the performance of da capo arias, although the practice has yet to become universal even among authentic performance artists.

==Famous examples==
Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot; (1742) includes two well-known da capo arias, &quot;He Was Despised&quot; (for alto voice) and &quot;The Trumpet Shall Sound&quot; (for bass). J. S. Bach&#x27;s cantata &quot;Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen, BWV 51&quot; (1730) begins with a flamboyant da capo aria for soprano, trumpet soloist, and strings.

<text>Meshuggah () is a Swedish extreme metal band formed in Umeå in 1987. Since 2004, the band&#x27;s lineup consists of founding members Jens Kidman (lead vocals) and Fredrik Thordendal (lead guitar), alongside rhythm guitarist Mårten Hagström, drummer Tomas Haake and bassist Dick Lövgren. Since its formation, the band has released nine studio albums, six EPs and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, &quot;Immutable&quot;, was released in April 2022 via Atomic Fire Records.

Meshuggah has become known for their innovative musical style and their complex, polymetered song structures and polyrhythms. They rose to fame as a significant act in extreme underground music, became an influence for modern metal bands, and gained a cult following. The band was labelled as one of the ten most important hard rock and heavy metal bands by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and as the most important band in metal by &quot;Alternative Press&quot;. In the late 2000s, the band was an inspiration for the djent subgenre.

In 2006 and 2009, Meshuggah was nominated for two Swedish Grammis Awards for their albums &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot; and &quot;obZen&quot;, respectively. In 2018, the band was nominated for a Grammy Award for their song &quot;Clockworks&quot; under the &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; category. The band has performed in various international festivals, including Ozzfest and Download, and embarked on the &quot;obZen&quot; world tour from 2008 to 2010, and also the &quot;Ophidian Trek&quot;.

== History ==
=== Formation and &quot;Contradictions Collapse&quot; (1987–1994) ===

In 1985, guitarist Fredrik Thordendal formed a band in Umeå, a university town in northern Sweden with a population of 105,000. The band, originally named Metallien, recorded a number of demo tapes, after which it disbanded. Thordendal, however, continued playing under a different name with new band members.

Meshuggah was formed in 1987 by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jens Kidman, and took the name Meshuggah from the Yiddish word for &quot;crazy&quot; (ultimately derived from the Hebrew word ). Kidman found the word in an American street slang dictionary. The band recorded several demos before Kidman left, which prompted the remaining members to disband. Kidman then formed a new band, Calipash, with guitarist Thordendal, bassist Peter Nordin and drummer Niklas Lundgren. Kidman, who also played guitar, and Thordendal decided to restore the name Meshuggah for the new band.

In 1989, Meshuggah released the self-titled, three-song EP &quot;Meshuggah&quot;, which is commonly known as &quot;Psykisk Testbild&quot; (a title that could be translated as &quot;Psychological Test-Picture&quot;). This 12&quot; (30 cm) vinyl EP had only 1,000 copies released, sold by local record store Garageland. The EP&#x27;s back cover features the band members with cheese doodles on their faces.

After replacing drummer Niklas Lundgren with Tomas Haake in 1990, Meshuggah signed a contract with German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast and recorded its debut full-length album, &quot;Contradictions Collapse&quot;. The LP, originally entitled &quot;(All this because of) Greed&quot;, was released in 1991. The album received positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. Soon after, Kidman decided to concentrate on vocals, and guitarist Mårten Hagström, who had already played in a band with Haake when they were in sixth grade, was recruited. The new lineup recorded the EP &quot;None&quot; at Tonteknik Recordings in Umeå in 1994 for release later that year. A Japanese version was also released, including lyrics printed in Japanese.

During this period, Thordendal, who was working as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a router accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal&#x27;s fingertip was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The &quot;Selfcaged&quot; EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.

=== &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot; (1995–1997) ===
In January 1995, Meshuggah undertook a short European tour organized by its record label Nuclear Blast. Afterwards, the band returned to the studio in February of that year to record the album &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot; at Soundfront Studios in Uppsala, with Daniel Bergstrand as a producer. Shortly thereafter, the band went on a European tour supporting Machine Head for two months. During the tour, Nordin became ill and experienced balance disorder with his inner ear. Due to the resulting chronic dizziness and vertigo, Nordin was forced to leave the tour and travel to Sweden. Machine Head&#x27;s bassist Adam Duce offered to cover his absence; however, Meshuggah decided to continue as a four-piece. Sometimes Thordendal played bass, while other times the band performed with two guitars. In this lineup, Hagström would use a pitch shifter to play his guitar at an octave lower than usual.

&quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot; was released in May 1995, with positive response from critics for the &quot;heady tempos and abstract approach&quot;. Kidman described the album cover: &quot;The title fits the pictures we cut out and stole from reference books in the library.&quot;

In mid-1995, Meshuggah had a short tour with Swedish band Clawfinger in Scandinavia and Germany. Nordin had to leave the band because of his sickness and was replaced by bassist Gustaf Hielm during the tour. In late 1995, Meshuggah went on a month-long tour with Hypocrisy.

During 1996 and 1997, Thordendal worked on his solo album &quot;Sol Niger Within&quot;, which was released in March 1997 in Scandinavia and in April in Japan. He also hosted Mats/Morgan Band&#x27;s debut. In 1997, Meshuggah recorded an unreleased demo, toured occasionally, and played a few concerts in its hometown. In May, Meshuggah moved to Stockholm to be closer to its management and the record industry in general.

The EP &quot;The True Human Design&quot; was recorded and released in late 1997. It contained one new song entitled &quot;Sane&quot;, and one live and two alternate versions of &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot;″s opening track &quot;Future Breed Machine&quot;. Thordendal&#x27;s solo album &quot;Sol Niger Within&quot; was simultaneously released in the United States, and Meshuggah started to plan its next album at the end of the year.

=== &quot;Chaosphere&quot; and &quot;Nothing&quot; (1998–2002) ===
Hielm officially joined the band in January 1998 after more than two years as a session member. Nuclear Blast re-released &quot;Contradictions Collapse&quot; with the addition of songs from the &quot;None&quot; EP. In May 1998, the title of the next album, &quot;Chaosphere&quot;, was reported and recording was done throughout May and June. Immediately after recording the album, Meshuggah went on a short US tour, and the album was released later in November 1998. Chaosphere&#x27;s sound is an almost complete departure from the thrash metal style of the band&#x27;s previous releases. Shortly after the release, Meshuggah toured Scandinavia with Entombed.

In early 1999, Meshuggah joined Slayer on their U.S. tour. After the new album and the live performances, Meshuggah was beginning to be recognized by mainstream music, guitar, drum and metal magazines. In mid-1999, Meshuggah performed in several Swedish concerts. The band started to write some new material but reported in mid-2000 that &quot;songwriting isn&#x27;t that dramatic, but we&#x27;re getting there slowly&quot;. While fans were waiting for the next album, a collection of demos (from the &quot;Psykisk Testbild&quot; EP), remixes and unreleased songs from the &quot;Chaosphere&quot; sessions were released as the &quot;Rare Trax&quot; album. Hielm left the band in July 2001 for unclear reasons. Meshuggah joined Tool on a lengthy tour, playing for more than 100,000 people total.

In March 2002, Meshuggah recorded three-track demos with programmed drums in their home studio, which were based on Haake&#x27;s sample &quot;Drumkit from Hell&quot;. The upcoming album was recorded in five to six weeks in May and was produced by the band at Dug-Out Studios in Uppsala and at its home studio in Stockholm. The last-minute decision to join 2002&#x27;s Ozzfest tour forced the band to mix the album in two days and master it in one. Meshuggah immediately went on another US tour after finishing the recording.

The album &quot;Nothing&quot; was released in August 2002, selling 6,525 copies during its first week in the US and reaching No. 165 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. With this album, Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and also became the first band signed to Nuclear Blast to be reviewed in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Meshuggah&#x27;s previous two releases, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Chaosphere&quot; and 1995&#x27;s &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot;, had sold 38,773 and 30,712 copies to that date, respectively. The CD booklet of &quot;Nothing&quot; has no liner notes, lyrics, or credits, only a hint of one word: &quot;ingenting&quot;, which is Swedish for &quot;nothing&quot;. All of this information is available on the CD-ROM. At the end of 2002, the band went on another US tour with Tool and a headlining tour of its own.

=== &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot; (2003–2006) ===
In 2003, Hagström hinted at the direction of the band&#x27;s next album by saying, &quot;There&#x27;s only one thing I really feel that is important. We&#x27;ve never measured our success in terms of sales, because we&#x27;re quite an extreme band. It&#x27;s more that people understand where we&#x27;re coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we&#x27;ve totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that&#x27;s not why we&#x27;re in it. So what I&#x27;d like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot; was like exploring the dynamics of the band, &quot;Chaosphere&quot; was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and &quot;Nothing&quot; is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don&#x27;t know where we&#x27;re going. It might be a mix of all of them.&quot;
In February 2004, bassist Dick Lövgren joined Meshuggah. The band then recorded and released the &quot;I&quot; EP, which contains a single, 21-minute track, released on Fractured Transmitter Records. Meshuggah spent about six months in total on recording the EP. &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot;, the only Meshuggah album on which programmed drums have been used, was released the following year in May 2005. Seven thousand copies of &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot; were sold the first week, and it debuted at No. 170 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in June 2005. The video for the track &quot;Shed&quot; was released in June, and the previous album &quot;Nothing&quot; sold approximately 80,000 copies in the United States to that date, according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot; earned the band a Swedish Grammy nomination. In October 2005, German band Rammstein released a single of their song &quot;Benzin&quot; with a remixed version by Meshuggah.

In December 2005, 10 years after signing its first record deal with the publishing company Warner/Chappell Music Scandinavia, Meshuggah extended its cooperation with the company. In November 2005, Haake said in an interview that the band was not content with the productions of &quot;Chaosphere&quot; and &quot;Nothing&quot;, because, being on tour, they had little time to devote to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic Nothing [CD/DVD]&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A remixed and remastered version of &quot;Nothing&quot; with rerecorded guitars was released in a custom-shaped slipcase featuring a three-dimensional hologram card on 31 October 2006, via Nuclear Blast Records. The release also includes a bonus DVD featuring the band&#x27;s appearance at the Download 2005 festival and the official music videos of &quot;Rational Gaze&quot;, &quot;Shed&quot; and &quot;New Millennium Cyanide Christ&quot;.

===&quot;obZen&quot; and &quot;Koloss&quot; (2007–2013)===

Meshuggah returned to the studio in March 2007 to record &quot;obZen&quot;, with recording concluding in October 2007, and the album being released in March 2008. The band spent almost a year on the album, its longest recording session yet. A significant portion of the year was spent learning to perform the songs they wrote; the recording itself took six months. &quot;obZen&quot; reached No. 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 11,400 U.S. copies in its first week of release and 50,000 copies after six months. With &quot;obZen&quot;, Meshuggah received more media attention and attracted new fans. The release was followed by a world tour, which started in the U.S. and proceeded to Europe, Asia and Australia.

In May 2008, Meshuggah published a music video for the song &quot;Bleed&quot;, which was produced by Ian McFarland and was written, directed and edited by Mike Pecci and Ian McFarland. Killswitch Productions said: &quot;It&#x27;s extremely cool to work with a band who is willing to allow the music and imagery to speak for itself and who does not insist on themselves being the prominent focus of the video.&quot;

In January 2009, &quot;obZen&quot; was nominated for the Swedish Grammis award in the &quot;Best Hard Rock&quot; category. In February 2009, Haake announced that the band was planning a concert DVD and a studio album. In April, Meshuggah was forced to cancel its Scandinavian shows in early 2009, due to Haake&#x27;s herniated disc in his lower back, which was causing problems with his right foot when playing. Haake later underwent a surgery and recovered for European summer festivals.

The concert DVD entitled &quot;Alive&quot; was released on 5 February 2010 in Europe and 9 February in North America. Thordendal started to work on a second solo album in June 2010 with the Belgian drummer Dirk Verbeuren.

The seventh studio album, &quot;Koloss&quot;, was released on 23 March 2012 in Germany, on 26 March in the rest of Europe, and 27 March in North America. &quot;Koloss&quot; reached No. 17 on the Billboard Top 200, and sold 18,342 copies in its first week. In Sweden, it reached No. 12.

===&quot;Pitch Black&quot; and &quot;The Violent Sleep of Reason&quot; (2013–2018)===
On 5 February 2013, Meshuggah released a free two-track EP entitled &quot;Pitch Black&quot; with Scion A/V. The EP features a previously unreleased track, &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, that was recorded by Fredrik Thordendal in 2003 at Fear and Loathing, in Stockholm Sweden. The second track is a live recording of &quot;Dancers to a Discordant System&quot; from &quot;obZen&quot;. The track was recorded at Distortion Fest in Eindhoven, Netherlands, on 9 December 2012.

On 12 May 2016, Meshuggah released a teaser video on their YouTube page and confirmed that their next studio album was to be released in late 2016. On 28 July 2016, the title was revealed to be &quot;The Violent Sleep of Reason&quot;, and was given a 7 October release date. &quot;The Violent Sleep of Reason&quot; was shortlisted by IMPALA (The Independent Music Companies Association) for the Album of the Year Award 2016, which rewards on a yearly basis the best album released on an independent European label.

On 2 June 2017, Meshuggah announced that Thordendal would take a leave from touring with the band; he would be temporarily replaced by Per Nilsson from Scar Symmetry. In 2018, Meshuggah received a Grammy nomination for their song &quot;Clockworks&quot; under the &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; category.

===&quot;Immutable&quot; (2019–present)===
In a November 2019 interview, Hagström hinted that the band had begun working on a new album. Recording started in March 2021. Later that month the band stated that Fredrik Thordendal had ended his hiatus and would be participating fully in the recording of the new album. On 28 January 2022, Meshuggah released a new song titled &quot;The Abysmal Eye&quot; taken from the band&#x27;s ninth album &quot;Immutable&quot;, which was later released on 1 April 2022 via Atomic Fire.

The band announced a spring 2025 North American tour with support from Cannibal Corpse and Carcass.

== Musical style ==
Meshuggah&#x27;s experimentation, stylistic variation and changes during its career cross several musical subgenres. Heavy metal subgenres experimental metal or avant-garde metal are umbrella terms that enable description of the career of the band in general. Extreme metal crosses both thrash metal and death metal (or technical death metal), which are at root of the sound of Meshuggah&#x27;s music, which has also been described as groove metal. The band has also been labelled as math metal and progressive metal. Meshuggah also incorporates elements of experimental jazz. In its review of &quot;Nothing&quot;, AllMusic describes Meshuggah as &quot;masterminds of cosmic calculus metal—call it Einstein metal if you want&quot;. Meshuggah&#x27;s early output was also considered alternative metal. Meshuggah creates a recognizable sonic imprint and distinct style.

Trademarks and characteristics that define Meshuggah&#x27;s sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagström notes that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t really matter if something is hard to play or not. The thing is, what does it do to your mind when you listen to it? Where does it take you?&quot; A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a &quot;breath controller&quot; device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with &quot;jazzlike cadence&quot;. The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore-style shouts and &quot;robotic&quot; death metal vocals.

In polymeters typically used by Meshuggah, the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5/16 or 17/16, while drums play in 4/4. One particular example of Haake&#x27;s use of polymeter is 4/4 against 23/16 bimeter, in which he keeps the hi-hat or china cymbal in 4/4 time but uses the snare and double bass drums in 23/16 time. On &quot;Rational Gaze&quot; (from &quot;Nothing&quot;), Haake plays simple 4/4 time, hitting the snare on each third beat, for 16 bars. At the same time, the guitars and bass are playing the same quarter notes, albeit in a different time signature; eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat. Hagström notes about the polymeters, &quot;We&#x27;ve never really been into the odd time signatures we get accused of using. Everything we do is based around a 4/4 core. It&#x27;s just that we arrange parts differently around that center to make it seem like something else is going on.&quot;

=== &quot;Contradictions Collapse&quot;, &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot; and &quot;Chaosphere&quot; ===
The early work of Meshuggah, influenced mainly by Metallica, is &quot;simpler and more straightforward than their more recent material, but some of their more progressive elements are present in the form of time-changes and polyrhythmics, and Fredrik Thordendal&#x27;s lead playing stands out&quot;. According to AllMusic, their debut album is a relatively immature, but original, release. Double bass drums and &quot;angular&quot; riffing also defined the early work of Meshuggah.

With the groundbreaking &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot;, Meshuggah showed fusion of death metal, thrash metal, progressive metal. AllMusic describes the style as &quot;weaving hardcore-style shouts amongst deceptively (and deviously) simple staccato guitar riffs and insanely precise drumming—often with all three components acting in different time signatures&quot;. Thordendal adds the melodic element with his typical lead guitar and uses his &quot;breath controller&quot; device most famously on the opening track &quot;Future Breed Machine&quot;.

&quot;Chaosphere&quot; incorporates typically fast, still tempo changing death metal. AllMusic compares the genre also with grindcore fathers Napalm Death. Rockdetector states: &quot;Whilst fans reveled in the maze like meanderings, critics struggled to dissect and analyze, hailing Haake&#x27;s unconventional use of dual 4/4 and 23/16 rhythm, Kidman&#x27;s mechanical staccato bark and Thordendal&#x27;s liberal usage of avant-garde jazz&quot;.

=== &quot;Nothing&quot;, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot; ===
On &quot;Nothing&quot;, Meshuggah abandons the fast tempos of &quot;Chaosphere&quot; and concentrates on slow, tuned down tempos and grooves. The album was intended to be recorded using custom-made Nevborn eight-string guitars, but the prototypes were faulty so Thordendal and Hagström used down tuned Ibanez seven-string guitars instead. This technique caused the instruments to slip out of tune during the sessions, which created additional problems. When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight-string guitars with two extra-low strings that worked properly after the initial release, the band re-recorded the guitar parts for &quot;Nothing&quot; and re-released it in 2006. Hagström notes that this allowed the band to go lower sonically and to attain bass sounds on guitars.

The &quot;I&quot; EP contains a single, 21-minute song of complex arrangements and was a hint of the forthcoming album, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot;. The EP, which has never been played live by the band, was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal. On &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot;, Meshuggah again used eight-string guitars, but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release, with the exception of two songs from 2001&#x27;s compilation &quot;Rare Trax&quot;. The album was self-produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger. Hagström notes, &quot;The eight-strings really have given us a whole new musical vocabulary to work with. Part of it is the restrictions they impose: you really can&#x27;t play power chords with them; the sound just turns to mush. Instead, we concentrated on coming up with really unusual single-note parts, new tunings and chord voicings. We wanted to get as far away from any kind of conventions and traditions as we could on the album, so the guitars worked out beautifully.&quot;

&quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot; is one 47-minute song divided into 13 sections. It is more mid-tempo guitar riff based, and a more straightforward and experimental full-length album than &quot;Chaosphere&quot; or &quot;Nothing&quot;. Nick Terry of &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; describes the album as a four-movement symphony. Some songs still use Meshuggah&#x27;s &quot;familiar template combining harsh vocals and nightmarish melodies over coarse, mechanically advancing, oddball tempos&quot;, while others explore ambient sounds and quieter dynamics. The first part of &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot; centers around two simple riffs. In the song &quot;In Death - Is Death&quot;, the band uses a combination of noise and silence, which is in contrast with the atypical melodies on &quot;Dehumanization&quot;. On &quot;Mind&#x27;s Mirrors&quot;, Meshuggah used electronics, programming and &quot;robotic voices&quot;. &quot;Shed&quot; incorporates tribal percussion and whispered vocals.

=== &quot;obZen&quot; and &quot;Koloss&quot; ===
With 2008&#x27;s &quot;obZen&quot;, Meshuggah moved away from the experimentation of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Nothing&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot; to return to the musical style of its previous albums, such as &quot;Contradictions Collapse&quot;, &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot; and &quot;Chaosphere&quot;, while still maintaining its focus on musical and technical innovation. The album loses some of the quick, mathematical rhythmic changes of past releases and the melodic orchestration of &quot;Catch Thirty-Three&quot; and uses &quot;angular&quot; riffs, mid-tempo and common 4/4 beats. The album is a culmination of the band&#x27;s previous work. Meshuggah decided to self-produce because it sought to retain artistic control over the recording and mixing process.

For &quot;obZen&quot;, Haake returned to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song &quot;Bleed&quot;. In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, &quot;[&#x27;Bleed&#x27;] was a big effort for me to learn, I had to find a totally new approach to playing the double bass drums to be able to do that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It&#x27;s kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I&#x27;m glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn&#x27;t even know if it was going to make it to the album.&quot; Hagström also stated, &quot;&quot;obZen&quot; is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape&quot;. &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot; confirms this statement: &quot;At first listen, &quot;obZen&quot; seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band&#x27;s other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group&#x27;s most complicated&quot;.

A common quality in &quot;Koloss&quot; identified by multiple critics and outlets is the album&#x27;s relatively straightforward, more groove-oriented sound, summed up by &quot;Metal Sucks&quot; as the band having &quot;streamlined their compositions to a great extent.&quot; The broad style of the record has been described as &quot;primal&quot; and featuring &quot;less jazzy virtuosity&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous output. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted that the record&#x27;s rawer production style advanced this &quot;tribal&quot; sound further. The album invokes a greater sound of menace and &quot;darkness&quot; according to Metal Injection; additionally, Jens Kidman&#x27;s vocals were described as &quot;exponentially more anguished&quot; than previous works. &quot;Metal Injection&quot; further compared the sound of the album&#x27;s closing track &quot;The Last Vigil&quot; to works by the instrumental band Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The record&#x27;s guitar riffs have been noted as deviating somewhat from Meshuggah&#x27;s earlier catalog, with &quot;SPIN&quot; identifying &quot;an almost bluesy swing&quot; in the playing style. &quot;SPIN&quot; further elaborated on the guitar leads, comparing the solos in &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Name is Surveillance&quot; and &quot;Marrow&quot; to the (non-metal) works of experimental composer Philip Glass and jazz-guitarist Allan Holdsworth respectively.

===&quot;The Violent Sleep of Reason&quot;===
For their eighth album, the band recorded live in studio, a production style they hadn&#x27;t pursued in reportedly &quot;20, 25 years&quot;. On rejecting the computerized format of recording of their previous albums, Haake said &quot;&quot;Obzen&quot; and &quot;Koloss&quot; are great albums, but, to me, they are a little too perfect. It didn&#x27;t really capture what we sounded like honestly. But where we recorded live, you get to hear the push and pull, one person might be a little ahead and the other might be a little behind. If you kill that, you can kill the energy.&quot; It is the first album to have no writing credit from Thordendal; the majority of the album was written by Haake and Lövgren.

=== Method and lyrical themes ===

Meshuggah&#x27;s music is written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with assistance from Kidman and Lövgren. During songwriting, a member programs the drums, and records the guitar and bass via computer. He presents his idea to the other members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards. Hagström explains that each member has an idea of what the others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively in terms of a particular instrument. Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.
Except for when Hagström needs a soloist, he and Thordendal rarely record together. Both play guitar and bass while composing. Haake says about his songwriting, &quot;Sometimes I&#x27;ll sample guitar parts, cut them up, pitch-shift and tweak them until I&#x27;ve built the riffs I want, just for demoing purposes. But most of the time I&#x27;ll just present the drums, and explain my ideas for the rest of the song, sing some riffs.&quot; The band uses Cubase to record the tracks, and the guitars are routed through software amplifier modeling, because it allows them to change the amp settings even after the song was fully recorded.

Approximately once a year, Haake writes most of the band&#x27;s lyrics, with the exception of finished tracks. His lyrical inspirations are derived from books and films. Aside from their album &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot;, Meshuggah does not usually record concept albums, although the band prefers strong conceptual underpinnings in the background.
Often esoteric and conceptual, Meshuggah&#x27;s lyrics explore themes such as existentialism. AllMusic describes &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot;&#x27;s lyrical focus as &quot;the integration of machines with organisms as humanity&#x27;s next logical evolutionary step&quot;. PopMatters&#x27; review of &quot;Nothing&quot; singles out the lyrics from &quot;Rational Gaze&quot;: &quot;Our light-induced image of truth—filtered blank of its substance / As our eyes won&#x27;t adhere to intuitive lines / Everything examined. Separated, one thing at a time / The harder we stare the more complete the disintegration.&quot; Haake explains that &quot;Catch Thirtythree&quot;&#x27;s cover, title and lyrics deal with &quot;the paradoxes/negations/contradictions of life and death (as we see it in our finest moments of unrestrained metaphoric interpretation)&quot;.
The main theme of &quot;obZen&quot; is &quot;human evil&quot;, according to Haake. The title is a play on the words &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;Zen&quot;; in addition, &quot;ob&quot; means &quot;anti&quot; in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot; finds the lyrics of the title track from &quot;obZen&quot; representative of the entire album: &quot;Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god.&quot; However, Haake claims, &quot;We don&#x27;t dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think we really wanted to paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We&#x27;re going, &#x27;Heads up. Here&#x27;s what some of the parts of being human are about, and this is what we can be at our worst.&#x27; So it&#x27;s more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time.&quot;

==Analysis==
Meshuggah has become known for its innovative musical style that evolves between each release and pushes heavy metal into new territory, and for its technical prowess. Hagström commented: &quot;We try never to repeat ourselves.&quot; RockDetector stated about &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot;: &quot;[T]he band...stripped Metal down to the bare essentials before completely rebuilding it in a totally abstract form&quot;. The official Meshuggah biography comments on &quot;Chaosphere&quot; by noting that &quot;Some fans felt that Meshuggah had left their dynamic and progressive elements behind; while others thought they were only progressing naturally and focusing on their original sound.&quot; The band&#x27;s website also describes &quot;Nothing&quot; as displaying &quot;a very mature and convincing Meshuggah, now focusing on groove and sound...Meshuggah once again divided their fans into the &#x27;ecstatic&#x27; and the &#x27;slightly disappointed&#x27;&quot;. The polyrhythms can make the music sound cacophonous, like band members are playing different songs simultaneously. Listeners perceiving a polyrhythm often either extract a composite pattern that is fitted to a metric framework, or focus on one rhythmic stream while treating others as &quot;noise&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; labeled Meshuggah as &quot;one of the ten most important hard and heavy bands&quot;, and &quot;Alternative Press&quot; described them as the &quot;most important band in metal&quot;. Meshuggah has been described as virtuoso or genius-bordering musicians, &quot;recognized by mainstream music magazines, especially those dedicated to particular instruments&quot;. In 2007, Meshuggah earned an in-depth analysis by the academic journal &quot;Music Theory Spectrum&quot;. Meshuggah has found little mainstream success but is a significant act in extreme underground music, an influence for modern metal bands and has a cult following. Meshuggah inspired the &quot;djent&quot; subgenre in progressive metal, that describes an &quot;elastic, syncopated guitar riff&quot; with its name. They were described as being &quot;the first djent band completely by accident&quot;; in a 2018 interview, Hagström jokingly apologised for the band&#x27;s role in creating the term, calling it a &quot;drunk misunderstanding&quot;.

<doc id="315547" wikidata="Q4930029" url="?curid=315547" title="Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire">
<text>Eynesbury is an urban area in the civil parish of St Neots, in the Huntingdonshire district of Cambridgeshire, England. It mainly consists of housing, although there is an area of light industry, and a large supermarket. In addition there is a large area of open grassland and a caravan park.

Up until the time of the Norman Conquest, Eynesbury included the area north of Hen Brook which is now St Neots. It was the fame of the relics of the Cornish monk, St Neot that caused the area near the Priory where his remains were kept, that caused that part of the town to become called St Neots.

==General description==
Eynesbury is an area of housing, and industrial and commercial buildings, now forming part of St Neots in Cambridgeshire. It lies to the east of the River Great Ouse, to the south of Hen Brook, and to the north-west of the A428 road (St Neots by-pass). It has a range of local shops for necessities and a small number of specialist shops, as well as a large supermarket. There is a post office and two convenience stores. More general shopping opportunities have migrated to St Neots town centre, although the supermarket is used by shoppers from the whole of St Neots and surrounding rural areas. Some light and medium industry is located along Cromwell Road. Residential housing has been built in recent years particularly around the area north of the Tesco supermarket.

Agricultural land lies to the east between the railway line and the A428 by-pass, but this is likely to be dedicated to housing in the coming years. A considerable area of amenity grassland lies in the curve of the River Great Ouse, in an area known as Pocket Park.

In the 1960s Eynesbury was subject to a considerable expansion in housing, as part of the London overspill scheme. A number of infill housing construction plans have been completed more recently. By contrast the Chequers Public House is considered to be the oldest building in Eynesbury.

Eynesbury is home to Ernulf Academy.

Eynesbury has a Non-League football club Eynesbury Rovers F.C., which play at Alfred Hall Memorial Ground.

The Coneygeare area next to the Coneygeare bridge over the River Great Ouse has a council-operated children&#x27;s play area, and nearby is St Neots Camping and Caravanning Club Site.

==Early history==
===Stone and Bronze Age===
There is evidence of bronze age occupation just south of Montague Square, in present-day Eynesbury. Iron age occupation has left evidence too, in the area occupied by Eynesbury School&#x27;s games fields, and near Howitts Lane. They were Belgic tribesmen from the Continent who conquered this part of the country in the century or so before the Roman invasion, and brought with them improved farming techniques.

===Roman period===
A Roman road passed close to the east of present-day Eynesbury and St Neots. It connected the Roman military stations of Sandy and Godmanchester. It ran about north - south and crossed the present-day A428 road (St Neots by-pass to Cambridge main road) just east of the roundabout where the B1428 joins it at Wintringham roundabout. A small Roman outpost was located a short distance to the west of that point, and a possible trading post has been identified in Eynesbury itself. Tebbutt speculates that Eynesbury may have been a location for loading agricultural produce onto river vessels for transport to other Roman locations. The settlement probably extended along the Great Ouse from the ford (near the site of the present-day road bridge) to the Coneygeare area.

===Anglo-Saxon===
A settlement existed in Eynesbury in the middle of the 8th century AD, and possibly earlier, known by some variation of its present-day name. From that time, part of the inhabitation was in what is now St Neots, but then considered part of Eynesbury. A village called Burg, or Bury, may have existed here in still earlier times. There was a ford of the River Great Ouse at that time.

The name Eynesbury is a corruption of Ernulph&#x27;s-Bury, abbreviated into Ern&#x27;sbury, or else a corruption of Ainulph&#x27;s-Bury contracted into Ain’sbury: the
village was therefore Ernulph&#x27;s Borough, or Ainulph&#x27;s Borough; however the identity of Ernulph or Ainulph is unknown. The most likely explanation is that Ernulph who lived here and died about the middle of the 8th century.
A hermit named Neot had founded a monastery in the Cornish village now known as St Neot. He became extremely famous for his piety and wisdom, and for miraculous events associated with him. In 877 AD he died, and his remains were housed at the monastery he had founded, and the monastery and the relics became the object of pilgrimage.

About 975 AD a nobleman and landowner named Leofric (alternatively Earl Alric) and his wife Leofleda (alternatively Countess Ethelfleda) had acquired extensive lands in Eynesbury; the name still included the area north of the Hen Brook now called St Neots. They soon founded a priory in what is now St Neots, close to the River Great Ouse. A priory could be a lucrative asset if it was of high religious repute, attracting pilgrims, and their money. Leofric and Leofleda needed the relics of a notable holy person as their patron, and Neot was their choice. They arranged to abstract his remains and brought them to their priory, where they were placed in a shrine.

===Norman conquest===
In 1066 William the Conqueror defeated the Anglo-Saxon defenders at the Battle of Hastings, and this resulted (after a struggle) in William becoming King. In 1085 William the Conqueror ordered that a survey of building and land ownership and value should be carried out, and this resulted in what is now known as the Domesday Book.

Eynesbury was listed in the Domesday Book as being in the Toseland Hundred in Huntingdonshire; the name of the Eynesbury was written as &quot;Einuluesberiam&quot; and &quot;Einuluesberie&quot; in the Domesday Book. In 1086 there were two manors at Eynesbury; the annual rent paid to the lords of the manors in 1066 had been £44 and the rent had increased to £47 in 1086.

The Domesday Book records that there were 76 households in Eynesbury in 1086, suggesting that the population was between 266 and 380 persons.

The Domesday Book uses units of measure for land area such as hide and ploughland. These were terms for the area of land that a team of eight oxen could plough in a single season and are equivalent to ; this was the amount of land that was considered to be sufficient to support a single family. By 1086, the hide had become a unit of tax assessment rather than an actual land area; a hide was the amount of land that could be assessed as £1 for tax purposes. The survey records that there were 52.5 ploughlands at Eynesbury in 1086 and that there was the capacity for a further 2.5 ploughlands. In addition to the arable land, there was of meadows, of woodland, three watermills and a fishery at Eynesbury.
The tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as geld or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. It was originally a way of collecting a tribute to pay off the Danes when they attacked England. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor&#x27;s land and other assets, a tax in proportion to value was levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manors at Eynesbury the total tax assessed was 24 geld. By 1086 there was already a church and a priest at Eynesbury.

===Geographical extent===
At the time of the Domesday Book (1086 AD) the name &quot;Eynesbury&quot; (or its alternative spellings) included all of present-day Eynesbury and St Neots, as well as agricultural land to the east towards Croxton and Abbotsley. As the fame of the Priory of St Neot became widespread in the twelfth century, the name St Neots took hold for the immediate area, and &quot;In honor of the Saint the name of the place was changed to Neots-bury.&quot; In time this became &quot;St Neots&quot;, and the extent of Eynesbury was correspondingly reduced. After 1113 AD this was formalised, and Abbotsley too was separated off, about 1138 AD.

==Development of Eynesbury==
The Parish Church of St Mary dates back to the 12th century and was rebuilt in 1688 and restored in 1857. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The manor of Eynesbury was held by the Ferrers and Devereux family (later Viscounts Hereford), until 1571, when it was sold to Sir James Dyer whose family sold it to Sir Sidney Montagu in 1639. His family, later Earls of Sandwich, gave their name to Montagu Street in the village.

Caldecote Manor was acquired by the Haberdashers Company in 1624.

Thomas Barton, chaplain to Prince Rupert, was rector of Eynesbury from 1629–31.

The parish was enclosed by the (37 Geo. 3. c. &quot;148&quot; ).

William Cole, the antiquary, was rector from 1768 to 1808.

In 1876, the village of Eynesbury and part of the rural parish were included in the district controlled by the Local Board of St Neots. A further rearrangement was made in 1895, when Eynesbury was divided into two civil parishes. The urban portion of 394 acres was now called the parish of Eynesbury, and included in the St Neots Urban District; the rest, with 2,641 acres of land, formed the parish of Eynesbury Hardwick.

==Modern history==
In the period following 1945, Government attention was given to the poor condition of housing in the Greater London area, and a series of measures classified as London overspill were implemented. This resulted in Eynesbury being selected for considerable expansion of council housing. The areas around Hardwick Road, Duck Lane, Sandfields Road, Howitts Gardens and Potton Road absorbed much of the migration from London.

Following the Education Act 1944 an expansion of secondary education took place. Neither Eynesbury nor Eaton Socon had enough pupils to justify a St Neots grammar school; at the time Eaton Socon was in Bedfordshire. It was not until 1960 that a secondary school was established in St Neots. It was only with the establishment of Longsands and Ernulf comprehensive schools in 1966 and 1971 that a full secondary education provision was made in St Neots.

In the early 1960s serious proposals were put forward to reorganise the areas controlled by local government in the area. As it seemed likely that Huntingdonshire would be disbanded, it was repeatedly said by some that St Neots and Eynesbury would prefer to join Bedfordshire rather than Cambridgeshire, as the town had limited affinity with the fen towns. A counterargument was that Bedfordshire had done little to improve Eaton Socon, whereas Huntingdon had done much to improve St Neots.

On 1 April 1965, Huntingdonshire was combined with the Soke of Peterborough to form an enlarged county. In 1974 Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough, as it was named, was finally merged with Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely, the entire new county being known as Cambridgeshire. Huntingdonshire County Council therefore disappeared in 1974, and it was replaced by the Huntingdon District Council, later renamed Huntingdonshire District Council, which functions as a unit within the enlarged county of Cambridgeshire. The boundaries of the HDC were very similar to those of the former county of Huntingdonshire, with the addition of Eaton Ford and Eaton Socon. In 1973 St Neots was granted power to create St Neots Town Council, to perpetuate some of the powers for the former St Neots Urban District Council, now abolished.

In the 1980s the Parklands estate was built, expanding Andrew Road and filling the gap between Potton Road and Barford Road. Most recently, the Eynesbury Manor development, which includes Eynesbury Marina, has been built between Ernulf Academy and the Tesco supermarket near the bypass; it stretches to the River Great Ouse to the west.

==Government==
St Neots Town Council Services are burials, grass cutting, play areas, public toilets, bins, committee meetings, events, and community centres.

Town Councillors for Eynesbury are (at 2021) Diana Collins, Emma Speed, Justin Cooper-Marsh (also an HDC member, below) Douglas Terry and Caroline Green.

Huntingdonshire District Council provides services such as building regulation enforcement, local planning, environmental health, leisure and tourism. Eynesbury is a part of the district ward of &quot;St Neots Eynesbury&quot; and is represented on the district council by three councillors, elected in May 2018 for four year terms: Barry Sidney Banks, Justin Christopher Cooper-Marsh and Douglas Terry, all of the Putting St Neots Residents First Party.

Cambridgeshire County Council, which has administration buildings in Cambridge, provides services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage services. Eynesbury is in the St Neots Eynesbury division of the County Council, and the seat is held by Simone Taylor, a St Neots Independent Group member.

There is a Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority. It consists of a directly elected mayor and the seven relevant local authorities (referred to as the Constituent Councils) and the Business Board (Local Enterprise Partnership). The Combined Authority Board consists of the mayor, the leaders of those bodies, and the Cambridgeshire &amp; Peterborough Police &amp; Crime Commissioner and representatives from the Cambridgeshire &amp; Peterborough Fire Authority and the Cambridgeshire &amp; Peterborough Clinical Commissioning Group. The mayor is Dr Nik Johnson (Labour).

Eynesbury was within the Huntingdon parliamentary constituency until the 2024 election, last represented in the House of Commons by Jonathan Djanogly (Conservative). Following the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, it was placed within St Neots and Mid Cambridgeshire, which returned Ian Sollom (Liberal Democrats) as MP at the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

The Police and Crime commissioner is Darryl Preston (Conservative).

===Past changes===
Following the Local Government Act 1888 the County of Huntingdonshire was established for the purposes of local government. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century this was regarded as too small to be viable, and after some abortive proposals, the new County of Huntingdon and Peterborough was established on 1 April 1965.

Eynesbury was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. In that year the administrative powers of the county of Huntingdonshire were abolished, and the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough took control. Then in 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Eynesbury became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire. In 1951 the parish had a population of 1348.

The civil parish was Eynesbury Hardwicke, which included the rural area extending eastward nearly to Croxton. In 2009 a further change was made, acknowledging the reality that St Neots was a single entity, having absorbed the urban part of Eynesbury as well as the Eatons. Eynesbury Hardwicke Civil Parish was abolished, and the area was divided between the existing St Neots Civil Parish and Abbotsley Civil Parish.

==Parish church==
The parish church of Eynesbury is the church of St Mary the Virgin. It was described by Betjeman in 1958:

Haphazard growth assimilating Norman and Pointed work (of three different periods), massive &#x27;gothic survival&#x27; tower of 1688 south side, and chancel reshaped by Victorians. Sacrifice of old east window over the chancel arch made east end unnecessarily dark; playfully carved benches from 1500s in north aisle; late 17th century pulpit.

On 1 March 2020, the two ecclesiastical parishes of Eynesbury and St Neots became the single parish of St Neots with Eynesbury: both churches are parish churches of the whole parish.

The church is a grade II* Listed Building.

The church purportedly received the body of Saint Myron of Crete in the 5th century, about 100 years after his death.

==Coneygeare ancient earthwork==
There was a large Roman camp at Coneygeare, a riverside location in Eynesbury. It extended from the present-day Luke Street to Hardwick Road and to the River Ouse and the Coneygeare bridge.

Gorham, writing in 1820, referred to this, and an update was provided by Ladds in 1926:

Most of the site has been dug for gravel, but a considerable portion of the western side is now occupied as allotment gardens and here although it much eroded by the plough the lines of the vallum can still be distinctly seen. At the western corner the outer angle of the bank is very clear and stands up some 5 feet above the surrounding ground but the inner line has been lost, doubtless by the cutting away of the vallum itself. From this point the northern vallum has been lost owing to gravel digging... on the western side the vallum... also stands some 5 feet above the surrounding ground and on the inside the land falls away with a gentle slope to the middle of the enclosure... The earthworks undoubtedly extended across the grass fields eastward of the field just referred to but there is little if anything which can be identified.

It would seem likely that the present road follows the shape of the eastern and northern sides of the enclosure, and the houses probably occupy the site of the vallum. At the North East corner of the allotments and extending across the occupation road leading to the grass field. A considerable Ridge may still be seen: it rises about 2 feet 6 inches above the ground and is apparently a roadway running through the enclosure.

The housing built at Hardwick Road and nearby has obliterated the site in more recent times.

==Notable people==
===The St Neots Quads===

In 1935 quadruplets were born to Mr and Mrs Miles, in Eynesbury. This caused a media sensation at the time, and they were the first British quadruplets to survive more than a few days. As they were very premature, the family doctor arranged for special medical care to be put in place in his own home at first. They were in demand for publicity purposes throughout their childhood and appeared several newsreels. In fact they are alive at the present day (2021) and are the oldest quadruplets in the world.

===The Eynesbury Giant===
James Toller was born in Eynesbury in 1798. He grew to be 8 ft inches (2.475m) tall, although some sources claim 8 ft 6in (2.591m). His parents were of ordinary stature. By the age of eighteen years he had grown to be over eight feet (2.44m) in height, and his feet were 15 inches in length.

In those days his height was regarded as an extraordinary phenomenon, and he became famous; he was presented in London to the Emperor of Russia and the King of Prussia. After touring the country in a show, he enlisted in the Life Guards, but his health was poor, and he left the army and returned home to Eynesbury.

He died on the 4 February 1818, at the age of 20. His family feared that his body might be stolen by body-snatchers after burial, and he was interred within Eynesbury church rather than in the churchyard. There seems to be no tablet in the church to indicate the location of his remains.

Many stories have been told about James Toller since his death about how he could walk along the streets of St Neots and Eynesbury and chat with people through their bedroom windows, or pass by the public houses along the high street and reach up and swing the signboards.

<doc id="315548" wikidata="Q210080" url="?curid=315548" title="Stabat Mater">
<text>The Stabat Mater is a 13th-century Christian hymn to the Virgin Mary that portrays her suffering as mother during the crucifixion of her son Jesus Christ. Its author may be either the Franciscan friar Jacopone da Todi or Pope Innocent III. The title comes from its first line, &quot;Stabat Mater dolorosa&quot;, which means &quot;the sorrowful mother was standing&quot;.

The hymn is sung at the liturgy on the memorial of Our Lady of Sorrows. The Stabat Mater has been set to music by many Western composers.

==Date==
The Stabat Mater has often been ascribed to Jacopone da Todi (ca. 1230–1306), but this has been strongly challenged by the discovery of the earliest notated copy of the Stabat Mater in a 13th-century gradual belonging to the Dominican nuns in Bologna (Museo Civico Medievale MS 518, fo. 200v-04r).

The Stabat Mater was well known by the end of the 14th century and Georgius Stella wrote of its use in 1388, while other historians note its use later in the same century. In Provence, about 1399, it was used during the nine days&#x27; processions.

As a liturgical sequence, the Stabat Mater was suppressed, along with hundreds of other sequences, by the Council of Trent, but restored to the missal by Pope Benedict XIII in 1727 for the Feast of the Seven Dolours of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

==Text and translation==
The Latin text below is from an 1853 Roman Breviary and is one of multiple extant versions of the poem. The first English translation by Edward Caswall is not literal but preserves the trochaic tetrameter rhyme scheme and sense of the original text. The second English version is a more formal equivalence translation.

==Indulgence==
To the &quot;Stabat mater&quot; was attributed the indulgence of &quot;100 days&quot; each time it was recited.

<text>Eaton Ford is an area in the civil parish of St Neots, Cambridgeshire, England. It is a mainly residential area also containing Riverside Park, a large area of riverside parkland. Much of the housing stock dates from the period of London overspill during the 1960s and subsequently. The former village green is still in place.

Eaton Ford lies in the area bounded by the River Great Ouse, Duloe Brook in the south, the A1 road to the west, and the River Kym in the north. The small marshy island in the Great Ouse at the confluence of the Kym is included.

Eaton Ford is approximately north of London. Historically Eaton Ford was in Bedfordshire; it was transferred to Cambridgeshire in 1974.

==Description of Eaton Ford==

Eaton Ford is a distinct area of St Neots, lying to the west of the River Great Ouse. It is largely residential, but with an extensive area of parkland – Riverside Park – adjacent to the river. There is practically no industrial activity within Eaton Ford, and most people in work travel to other parts of St Neots, or commute further afield.

Eaton Ford Green forms a small but pleasing &quot;village green&quot; focus to the community, and St Neots Town Council arrange to maintain flower beds. Maltman&#x27;s Green is a grassy area at the junction of St Neots Road and Crosshall Road, but has long since lost its attractiveness to road improvement schemes.

There is a large school complex, Crosshall Junior School on the Great North Road, with considerable pedestrian and vehicular traffic generated at the start and end of the school day. (Despite the historic name, the Great North Road is only a local distributor road here).

St Neots Golf Club is located on Crosshall Road, and the grounds occupy nearly all of the northern part of Eaton Ford up to the River Kym, which forms the boundary. The other occupier of this part of Eaton Ford is a marina, Crosshall Marine Ltd. Its tucked-away location means that it may well be unknown to residents who do not play golf and do not use river craft.

Eaton Ford has a semi-independent convenience store and a public house, the Barley Mow.

The low-lying areas near the river have been subject to flooding, and a flood control scheme has been implemented; the Riverside Park adjacent to The Paddock, the carpark there, and adjacent areas are planned surge containment zones: in times of heavy water flow in the river, these areas are flooded to prevent more serious inundation; flood control banks are provided to protect houses in The Paddock.

==History==

In Anglo-Saxon times there were small settlements on the west side of the River Great Ouse. A village was formed near the water&#x27;s edge, probably opposite the Coneygeare, and this was called Ea-tun, meaning waterside-village. Another, smaller settlement a little further north was called Forda, and later simply Ford. A further small settlement was on the hilltop near the present Duloe windmill, and was then called Sudbury, meaning the southern fort.

At that time the River Great Ouse was much wider and shallower than at present, with ill-defined banks. This made fording the river possible with care, and by choosing a dryer period to do so.

Ea-tun came to be known as Eaton, and after the Norman Conquest the more southerly part was designated by the fact that it was part of a soke, a governmental sub-division, and in time this became Eaton Socon. The important Ford in the northern part came to be known as Eaton Ford. There were other places where the Great Ouse could be forded, but this seems to have been the principal crossing place.

The name Eaton Ford was understood casually, but only took formal significance in 1963, when it was separated from Eaton Socon.

==St Neots Priory==
About 972 AD an Anglo-Saxon landowner named Leofric and his wife Leoflaed founded a small monastery in Eynesbury (at that time known as Ernulph&#x27;s Bury, and including part of the present day St Neots). The settlement was established at the junction of Huntingdon Street and Cambridge Street.

The Priory had the potential to generate considerable income from the visits and donations of pilgrims, but to attract pilgrims they needed relics. Leofric decided to obtain the remains of Saint Neot, a much-revered Saxon monk who had spent much of his life in Cornwall and who had died in about 875 AD. His remains were kept there and had become the object of pilgrimages. Leofric arranged to abstract Neot&#x27;s bones, depositing them in his Priory. This had the desired effect and the Priory became a major centre of attention for pilgrims. Over time, the Priory and the locality where it was situated, became known as St Neots.

The combination of visits of pilgrims and visitors to the market made the Ford at Eaton of great importance, and slowly the name Eaton Ford came to be used.

Young speculates that it was a little to the north of the present-day bridge, because of the angle of approach of Crosshall Road, which nowadays lurches southwards as it approaches the river.

==Sudbury==
In Anglo-Saxon times there was a small settlement named Sudbury (&quot;southern fort&quot;). It was probably at the junction of the present-day Crosshall Road and the traditional Great North Road. In 1086, according to the Domesday Book, Eudo Dapifer held Eaton Socon &quot;with the Manors of Wyboston and Sudbury&quot;; the tenant-in-chief at Sudbury being Richard, son of Gilbert. Later, Sudbury was recorded as having belonged to St Neots Priory in King Edward’s time. The family who became Lords of the Manor there in the 13th century eventually adopted the name of the Manor as their surname and became known as &quot;de Sudbury&quot;.

The Manor House may have stood on or near the site of the present farmhouse to the north-east of Cross Hall crossroads. The word &quot;Hall&quot; is usually associated with manor houses and it would be logical for a manor house situated at a crossroads to be called &quot;Cross Hall&quot;. Traces of the strips that once composed the arable fields of Sudbury can still be seen as ridge-and-furrow waves on St Neots Golf Course. The disappearance of Sudbury village may have been due to the Black Death of 1348-9 which reputedly shrank the population of England by a third. Many travellers would have passed through the village from London to the north and they may have carried their germs with them.

==The river bridge==
The first bridge across the River Great Ouse at St Neots was probably built in the 11th or 12th century to bring traders and pilgrims into the market place established by the monks of St Neots Priory. It probably replaced a ford. It was constructed entirely in timber and, because there were marshy areas both sides of the river, it included a long causeway.

In 1588, a new town bridge was built. A survey of the old bridge showed that it consisted of 72 arches, and it was 704 feet in length and 7 ft 6in wide. The replacement bridge was to have masonry piers up to the flood water level. The river formed the boundary between Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, so both counties had to contribute to the costs of materials and labour.

The town bridge was replaced again, probably in 1617, but this time entirely in masonry. The bridge was clearly of great importance as it allowed river traffic to pass without hindrance (by removal of the ford), and commerce was becoming increasingly important. Other improvements in the same period included river work to improve navigability, and to make Bedford accessible. In 1670 the River Ouse (Bedfordshire) Navigation Act was passed for improvements to the River Ouse, to enable navigation as far as Bedford.

During the 19th century the superstructure of the bridge was widened and the &quot;scallops&quot; peculiar to the Huntingdonshire half were carried across the whole length of the parapet. (The scallops were in fact jack-arches supported on cantilever beams, supporting the footway extensions.) The end of the bridge at Eaton Ford was also widened to make less of a bottleneck.

The old stone bridge survived well into the 20th century, but it proved inadequate for the weight of modern motor traffic, even when passage over it was restricted to one-way operation. There was a five mph speed limit. Because of its position on a county boundary, the negotiations regarding its replacement were prolonged and took over 20 years to complete. Finally in 1964, the picturesque but fragile structure was demolished and work began on the present more practical bridge.

==The Workhouse==
In the early years of the nineteenth century, the provision of relief for the destitute was uncoordinated and unsatisfactory. It was the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 which gave local government the task of making coordinated arrangements, and this swiftly led to the formation of Poor Law Unions, in which parishes would collaborate in providing workhouses. The destitute would be given indoor shelter and food, and would be allocated work they were considered capable of. This resulted in the formation of St Neots Poor Law Union on 24 September 1835. After some difficulty in finding a suitable site, a workhouse was built in Eaton Socon (the location is now considered to be in Eaton Ford). Its capacity was 250 persons. A separate infirmary block was ready in 1879, increasing the limited capacity of the workhouse.

In the late 1920s the building ceased to operate as a workhouse, and became used as a hospital for the elderly, and renamed the White House. In the 1950s part of it was converted for use as flats, and in the 1980s the building was completely upgraded internally, and the entire building was made into flats.

==Housing expansion==
In the period following 1960 Eaton Ford expanded quickly under the London overspill programme and subsequent housing development. Prior to this scheme, the housing stock in Eaton Ford was largely confined to ribbon development along St Neots Road and Mill Hill Road. The new housing infilled practically the whole of Eaton Ford, leaving only the Riverside Park and the golf course undeveloped.

==Crosshall schools==
The Crosshall Infant and Junior Schools were opened in 1974 to respond to population growth.

==Public houses==
The Eaton Oak is a hotel and restaurant near Crosshall crossroads; it is a listed building.

==Transfer from Bedfordshire==
In common with Eaton Socon, Eaton Ford had historically been part of Bedfordshire. In the 1960s they were transferred to Huntingdonshire, to join St Neots, of which they had become a part for practical purposes. In 1974 Huntingdonshire was abolished as a County, and Eaton Ford was in Cambridgeshire.

==Golf club==
St Neots Golf Club had existed from before 1900, but in 1912 it moved to its present site alongside Crosshall Road.

==Road improvements==
Until the 1960s, the road network in Eaton Ford consisted of the Great North Road, the spur of St Neots Road leading from the roundabout to the river bridge, Crosshall Road, and Mill Hill Road. The Great North Road was a busy and important route, but it was a single carriageway. Crosshall Road was part of the A45 trunk road, leading from Kimbolton to St Neots town centre and on to Cambridge.

When the present A1 road was built, forming a by-pass on the western side, the Great North Road served as the route into St Neots from Wyboston, and the section north of the roundabout carried local traffic only. When St Neots by-pass opened, the A45 traffic used the A1 to the Wyboston roundabout and then the by-pass, so that the whole Eaton Ford road network was now of local significance only.

==Army depot==
From 1937 or 1938 there was an army depot alongside Mill Hill Road, on the south side. It extended over most of the length of Mill Hill Road. Intensely heightened political tension with Germany led to a period of rearmament, and a basic training camp for recruits was established. On the outbreak of World War II the camp was converted to be a base for the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. A searchlight and anti-aircraft gun emplacement were located within the camp, at the boundary at Great North Road.

After the war some families continued in residence on the site until 1959, when the site was sold out of army usage. The Eastern Electricity Board purchased it and from 1960 used it as a works depot and training facility. The EEB planned to develop the site further, but the local authority planning strategy prevented that. The EEB later ran their activity down, and withdrew completely by 1977. Housebuilding took place on the land as it was vacated. The last remaining building from the Army activity was removed in 1983.

==Government==
Eaton Ford is within the area of St Neots Town Council; there is an Eaton Ford ward.

Huntingdonshire District Council is the next tier, with offices in Huntingdon. It collects all council tax and administers/provides building regulations, planning and environmental checks/approvals, day centres, assessed housing benefits, parks, waste collections, a communal leisure budget and supports tourism.

The next tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council, headquartered in Cambridge. This provides county-wide services such as road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage.

The fourth tier is the Peterborough and Cambridgeshire Combined Authority, responsible for strategic planning.

Eaton Ford is in the Huntingdon parliamentary constituency. The Member of Parliament is (2021) Jonathan Djanogly (Conservative).

He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Sligo–Leitrim constituency from 1969 to 1988. He also served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Connacht–Ulster constituency.

==Early life==
Born in Sligo, MacSharry was educated at the local national school before later briefly attending Summerhill College. After leaving school he worked as a livestock dealer throughout County Sligo and County Mayo, before becoming involved in the Meat Exporters Factory in his native town. MacSharry also owned his haulage firm.

==Political career==
===Beginnings===
MacSharry came from a non-political family; however, he became an active member of Fianna Fáil in Sligo. In 1967, he made his first move into politics when he secured election to both Sligo Borough Council and Sligo County Council.

MacSharry was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Sligo–Leitrim constituency at the 1969 general election. MacSharry was re-elected to the Dáil at the 1973 general election; however, Fianna Fáil went into opposition as a Fine Gael–Labour Party government came to office. In Jack Lynch&#x27;s subsequent front bench reshuffle, MacSharry was appointed Opposition Spokesperson on the Office of Public Works.

Following the 1977 general election, Fianna Fáil returned to government with a twenty-seat Dáil majority. In January 1978, with the introduction of the new Minister of State positions, he secured a junior ministerial post for the first time, as Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service.

===Cabinet minister===
In December 1979, Lynch announced his resignation as Taoiseach and as Fianna Fáil leader. The subsequent leadership contest was a straight battle between George Colley and Charles Haughey. Colley was the favoured choice of the outgoing leadership and the majority of the cabinet while Haughey had the backing of a large rump of backbench TDs who had become disillusioned with the party leadership. Although MacSharry was serving as junior minister to Colley, he was one of the strongest supporters of Haughey and nominated him for the position of party leader. Haughey succeeded in becoming party leader, albeit by a narrow margin of just six votes, and soon after was appointed as Taoiseach. MacSharry&#x27;s support for Haughey was rewarded when he was appointed Minister for Agriculture in the new government. Agriculture was viewed as a key portfolio in Haughey&#x27;s new cabinet and MacSharry was regarded as an effective Minister at a time when farm prices were falling. He was also successful in agricultural negotiations with the EEC.

Following the 1981 general election, Fianna Fáil returned to opposition. In the new Fianna Fáil front bench, MacSharry was retained as Spokesperson for Agriculture, but a later reshuffle saw him move to fisheries.

Fianna Fáil returned to government following the February 1982 general election and MacSharry was appointed as Tánaiste and Minister for Finance. At a time when Ireland was going through a recession, MacSharry introduced a budget which increased income tax at all levels. It was his only budget as the government fell after just nine months in office and a new coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office.

===1983 bugging scandal===
In 1983, MacSharry resigned from the Fianna Fáil front bench due to the phone tapping scandal, when it was revealed that as Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, he had borrowed police tape recorders to secretly record conversations with a cabinet colleague. He defended his action by saying that rumours were sweeping the party that he could be &quot;bought&quot; to support efforts to depose Haughey; he claimed he used the equipment to record any attempts made to offer bribes. The scandal was however primarily focused on the decision by the Minister for Justice, Seán Doherty, to bug the phones of two leading political journalists to discover their anti-Haughey sources. MacSharry was a secondary but high-profile casualty of the scandal, as the equipment he had used had been supplied by Doherty, who had requested it from Assistant Garda Commissioner Joseph Ainsworth. Ainsworth was also forced to resign when the scandal reached the headlines.

===Political comeback and European Commissioner===
MacSharry spent several years in the political wilderness following the phone-tapping scandal. He was elected to the European Parliament as an MEP for Connacht–Ulster at the 1984 election.

Following the 1987 general election, MacSharry was returned to the Dáil. He resigned his European Parliament seat when he was appointed again as Minister for Finance in Haughey&#x27;s new government. During his second tenure in charge of finance, MacSharry committed himself to bringing order to the public finances and the poor economic situation. His ruthless cutting of state spending earned him the nickname &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;.

During this time he came to be identified as Haughey&#x27;s heir apparent as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader. MacSharry, however, had no such aspirations and had wanted to leave politics by the time he was forty-five. He was now fifty and had achieved some of the highest offices in the government of Ireland. In 1988, MacSharry&#x27;s loyalty to Haughey was rewarded when he was appointed European Commissioner. As a result of this he resigned his Dáil seat, ending his domestic political career.

MacSharry was the first European Commissioner for Agriculture to work out a meaningful compromise on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992. The MacSharry reforms marked the turning point between the old CAP policy, and the new, although many other reforms followed his.

==Retirement from politics==

Following the completion of his term as European Commissioner, MacSharry retired from politics to pursue business interests. He is currently a director on the boards of a variety of companies including Bank of Ireland and Ryanair Holdings. In 1999, he was appointed chairman of Eircom plc. MacSharry is also a member of the Comite d&#x27;Honneur of the Institute of European Affairs.

MacSharry is a non-executive director of Irish Life and Permanent and receives pension payments of €88,936 every year.

==Private life==
MacSharry was married to Elaine and the couple had six children. One of his sons, Marc MacSharry, has served as a Councillor on Sligo County Council, as a Senator in Seanad Éireann representing the Industrial and Commercial Panel from 2002 to 2016, and as a TD for the constituency of Sligo–Leitrim since 2016. His nephew Tom MacSharry was a Councillor on Sligo Borough Council, 2004–09, and served as Mayor in 2006–07.

<doc id="315562" wikidata="Q2302329" url="?curid=315562" title="Starstreak">
<text>Starstreak is a British short-range surface-to-air missile that can be used as a man-portable air-defence system (MANPADS) or used in heavier systems. It is manufactured by Thales Air Defence (formerly Shorts Missile Systems) in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is also known as Starstreak HVM (High Velocity Missile). After launch, the missile accelerates to more than Mach 4, making it the fastest short-range surface-to-air missile in existence. It then launches three laser beam-riding submunitions, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit on the target. Starstreak has been in service with the British Army since 1997. In 2012 Thales relaunched the system as ForceSHIELD.

==Development==

Development on the missile began in the early 1980s after an evaluation of missile and gun options to increase air defence capabilities showed that a high-velocity missile system would best meet the needs and could also replace existing shoulder-launched missiles. A General Staff Requirement (GSR3979) was drawn up with the requirements of the system, specifying the requirement of three launch platforms for the missile:
* A self-propelled launcher.
* A three-round lightweight launcher.
* A man-portable launcher.

In 1984, the British Ministry of Defence awarded development contracts to British Aerospace (BAe) and Shorts Missile Systems; the BAe missile was known as Thunderbolt HVM. Shorts won the competition and were awarded £356 million. Further development and a production contract materialized in November 1986, and the missile was officially accepted into service in September 1997. The missile was intended to replace the Javelin surface-to-air missile in British service. The LML and shoulder-launched versions have been in use since 2000.

In July 2001, Thales received a contract for a successor identification friend or foe system for Starstreak.

In mid-2007, Thales UK in Northern Ireland revealed that it had developed Starstreak II, a much improved successor to the Starstreak missile. Some of the advantages of the new version are increased range of , improved lethality, an improved targeting system, and much higher operating ceiling.

In 2011, when it won a contract for the Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM), Thales announced it had agreed with the Ministry of Defence to &quot;re-role previously contracted budgets to facilitate the full-scale development, series production and introduction of the LMM.&quot; The contract affected is speculated to have been Starstreak.

==Description==
When used in the light or MANPADS role, the Starstreak missile is transported in a sealed launch tube. This tube is attached to an aiming unit for firing. The operator tracks the target using the aiming unit&#x27;s optically stabilized sight. The process of tracking the target allows the aiming unit to compute the right trajectory to bring the missile together with the target. The operator can indicate wind direction to the unit and, in the case of a long-range target, provide superelevation. When the initial tracking is complete, the operator fires the missile by pressing a button.

The missile then fires the first-stage rocket motor; this launches the missile from the tube but burns out before leaving the tube to protect the operator. away from the operator, when the missile is at a safe distance, the second stage fires. This rapidly accelerates the missile to a burn-out velocity exceeding Mach 3. As the second stage burns out, three dart sub-munitions are released.

The dart housing is made from a tungsten alloy. The darts are each long, in diameter, and about in mass. Around half the weight of each dart – approximately – is its explosive charge, detonated by a delayed-action, impact-activated fuse. Each dart consists of a rotating fore-body, with two canard fins, attached to a non-rotating rear assembly with four fins. The rear assembly of each dart also houses the guidance electronics including a rearwards facing sensor.

The darts do not home in on laser energy reflected from the target; instead, the aiming unit projects two laser beams which paint a two-dimensional matrix upon the target. The lasers are modulated, and by examining these modulations the sub-munitions sensor can determine the dart&#x27;s location within the matrix. The dart is then steered to keep it in the centre of the matrix. The sub-munitions steer by briefly decelerating the rotating fore-body with a clutch. The front wings then steer the missile in the appropriate direction. The three sub-munitions fly in a formation about in radius, and have enough kinetic energy to manoeuvre to meet a target evading at 9g at altitude.

Earlier laser guidance systems used a single beam that had to be kept on the target at all times, the missile homing in on laser energy reflected off the target; if it moved off the target, the reflection would end and guidance would be lost until the target was regained. This problem could be reduced by making the laser&#x27;s beam wider, but at the cost of reduced accuracy and reflected energy. Starstreak&#x27;s system allows for the beam area to be much larger than the target while retaining pinpoint accuracy.

On impact with the target a delayed-action fuze is triggered, allowing the projectile to penetrate the target before the explosive warhead detonates. The tungsten housing is designed to fragment and maximise damage inside the target.

In September 1999, the missile was demonstrated against an FV432 armoured personnel carrier, illustrating the missile&#x27;s effectiveness as a surface-to-surface weapon. Each sub-munition dart travelling at has comparable kinetic energy to a shell from a Bofors 40 mm gun, though it lacks the armour-penetration capabilities of a purpose-built anti-tank guided missile or a dual-purpose missile (such as the Air Defence Anti-Tank System).

===Advantages===
Starstreak has a number of advantages over infrared homing guided, radar homing guided, and radio command guidance MCLOS/SACLOS (e.g. Blowpipe or Javelin) missiles:
* It cannot be jammed by infrared countermeasures or radar/radio countermeasures.
* It cannot be suppressed with anti-radar missiles.

==Service history==

The missile was brought into service with 12th Regiment Royal Artillery and 47th Regiment Royal Artillery in 1997 as part of the High Velocity Missile (HVM) system equipped with both the Air Defence Acquisition Device (ADAD) and a ×60 thermal sight. Each regiment was equipped with 108 HVM self-propelled armoured launchers mounted on the Stormer tracked chassis capable of holding eight missiles ready to fire and a further eight reloads (the original capacity of twelve was reduced during a revision). The launchers could originally run on batteries for extended periods to minimise their signature, but significant upgrades dramatically increased the system&#x27;s power requirements. A light-role variant known as HVM Lightweight Multi Launch (LML), capable of holding three ready-to-fire missiles, was also brought into service with the Air Defence Troop Royal Marines and a Royal Artillery Air Assault Battery attached to 16 Air Assault Brigade. The systems&#x27; armoured variant, the HVM Self Propelled (Stormer), saw service during the Second Gulf War but did not fire. The British Army currently uses the A5 fifth-generation missile, significantly improved from the original missile. The HVM SP and LML variants now carry a mix of both Starstreak A5 and Lightweight Multirole Missiles.

In 2012 HVM LML light role detachments equipped with Starstreak A4 missiles were emplaced on top of several blocks of flats in London to provide air defence for the 2012 London Olympics. In 2013, the British MoD ordered 200 more Starstreak missiles.

On 16 March 2022, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced that the UK would supply Ukraine with Starstreak missiles to help prevent Russian air supremacy. British soldiers trained Ukrainian forces to use the system. HVM SPs were also deployed to Poland as an interim measure until the arrival of Sky Sabre. In April 2022, Starstreak missiles were in use by Ukrainian soldiers, and it was reported that Ukrainian forces appeared to have successfully used the system to shoot down a Russian Mi-28N attack helicopter. The missile, according to footage released by the UK MoD, hit with all three projectiles, splitting the helicopter in half. In April 2022, the UK announced it would be providing Alvis Stormer vehicles armed with Starstreak. By June 2023, the system had been used to shoot down multiple Russian drones.

The British Army deployed Starstreak missiles to assist with the security of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

October 2024 Portuguese Army Ordered 3 Rapid ranger quad launcher mounted on Vamtac St5 vehicles and 1 3D radar unit and LML missiles. Additional orders should rise to 12 units over next 6 years under the Lei de Programme 2023 to 2030.

==Variants==
* ATASK (Air To Air Starstreak): Fired from a helicopter. This was developed in combination with McDonnell-Douglas and Lockheed Martin electronics between 1995 and 1998 specifically for use with the AH-64 Apache. It has yet to enter service.
* LML: Fired from a Lightweight Multiple Launcher (LML) that holds three missiles ready for firing and can be used as either a stationary launch unit or mounted on a light vehicle such as a Land Rover or HMMWV (Humvee). The LML originated in a proposal under the Army Suggestions Scheme for the Javelin system.
* Seastreak: Two versions of a naval mounting have been demonstrated—a one-man mount similar to the LML but carrying a total of six missiles, and a close in weapon system mounting holding 24 missiles.
* Self-propelled (SP) HVM: Carried on an Alvis Stormer AFV with a roof-mounted eight-round launcher with internal storage for a further 8 missiles. This is the most common variant.
* Starstreak Avenger: Built to a U.S. Army requirement in the early 1990s, this system integrated the Starstreak missile on the Boeing Avenger vehicle, replacing 1 pod of Stinger missiles with 1 pod of 4 Starstreak and modifying the fire control system accordingly.
* Starstreak Mark II: Upgrade to the Starstreak.
* THOR/Multi Mission System (MMS): A four-missile turret mounted on a Pinzgauer (6×6) cross-country chassis, launched by Thales UK in 2005.
* RapidRanger MMS weapon launcher on URO VAMTAC vehicle

* Man-portable shoulder launcher

<text>Gemeinschaft () and Gesellschaft (), generally translated as &quot;community and society&quot;, are categories which were used by the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies in order to categorize social relationships into two types. The Gesellschaft is associated with modern society and rational self-interest, which weakens the traditional bonds of family and local community that typify the Gemeinschaft. Max Weber, a founding figure in sociology, also wrote extensively about the relationship between &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; and &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;. Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies.

==&quot;Gemeinschaft&quot;–&quot;Gesellschaft&quot; dichotomy==

According to the dichotomy, social ties can be categorized, on one hand, as belonging to personal social interactions, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions (&quot;Gemeinschaft&quot;, German, commonly translated as &quot;community&quot;), or on the other hand as belonging to indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions (&quot;Gesellschaft&quot;, German, commonly translated as society as in association, corporation, including company, modern state and academia). The &quot;Gemeinschaft–Gesellschaft&quot; dichotomy was proposed by Tönnies as a purely conceptual tool rather than as an ideal type in the way it was used by Max Weber to accentuate the key elements of a historical social change.

Tönnies was a Thomas Hobbes scholarhe edited the standard modern editions of Hobbes&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Law&quot; and &quot;Leviathan&quot;. It was his study of Hobbes that encouraged Tönnies to devote himself wholly to the philosophy of history and the philosophy of law. And it has been argued that he derived both categories from Hobbes&#x27;s concepts of &quot;concord&quot; and &quot;union&quot;.

The second edition, published in 1912, of the work in which Tönnies further promoted the concepts turned out to be an unexpected but lasting success after the first edition was published in 1887 with the subtitle &quot;Treatise on Communism and Socialism as Empirical Patterns of Culture&quot;. Seven more German editions followed, the last in 1935, and it became part of the general stock of ideas with which pre-1933 German intellectuals were quite familiar. The book sparked a revival of corporatist thinking, including the rise of neo-medievalism, the rise of support for guild socialism, and caused major changes in the field of sociology. The distinction between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft was a large part of the discussion and debate about what constitutes community, among heavily influenced social theorists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century such as Georg Simmel, Émile Durkheim and Max Weber.

The concepts &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; and &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; were also used by Max Weber in &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, which was first published in 1921. Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies, and argued that &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; is rooted in a &quot;subjective feeling&quot; that may be &quot;affectual or traditional&quot;. &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;-based relationships, according to Weber, are rooted in &quot;rational agreement by mutual consent&quot;, the best example of which is a commercial contract. To emphasize the fluidity and amorphousness of the relationship between &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; and &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;, Weber modified the terms in German to &quot;Vergemeinschaftung&quot;, and &quot;Vergesellschaftung&quot;, which are the gerund forms of the German words. Weber&#x27;s distinction between &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; and &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; is highlighted in the essay &quot;Classes, Stände, Parties&quot;, which is the basis for Weber&#x27;s three-component theory of stratification.

Having put forward his conception of the &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot;–&quot;Gesellschaft&quot; dichotomy, Tönnies was drawn into a sharp polemic with Émile Durkheim. In a review of Tönnies&#x27;s book in 1889, Durkheim interpreted &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; as having mechanical solidarity, and &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; as having organic solidarity, reproaching Tönnies for considering the second type of social organisation artificial and not expanding on the transition from the one type to the other. Durkheim stated that Tönnies&#x27;s approach to understanding &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; was &quot;completely ideological&quot; but that &quot;one cannot fail to recognize in this book truly forceful thinking and an uncommon power of organization.&quot; Tönnies did not agree with Durkheim&#x27;s interpretation of his views, and in turn, when reviewing Durkheim&#x27;s &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot; (1896), wrote that Durkheim failed to deal critically enough with the division of labor and that Durkheim&#x27;s whole sociology was a modification of Spencer&#x27;s (who had his own dichotomy between what he called the &quot;militant society&quot; and the &quot;industrial society&quot;).

In World War I propaganda self-sacrificing (virtuous) women were portrayed as the heart of the &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; by providing the model for the dutiful wartime home maker supporting the war effort by sending their men (husbands and sons) to serve in the war, and maintaining the home in their absence. (In the wartime propaganda this &quot;virtuous woman&quot; was an ideal contrasted to less desirable archetypes that was presented as immoral or unethical women).

==Globalization==

Eric Hobsbawm argued that, as globalization turns the entire planet into an increasingly remote kind of &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;, so too collective identity politics seeks for a fictitious remaking of the qualities of &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; by artificially reforging group bonds and identities.

Fredric Jameson highlights the ambivalent envy felt by those constructed by &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; for remaining enclaves of &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot;, even as they inevitably corrode their existence.

<text>Jason Robertson (August 28, 1980 – September 4, 2003) was an AIDS activist. He became a symbol for the rights of children with AIDS at age 7, when he sued for, and won, the right to attend regular classes at his elementary school.

==Biography==
Robertson was diagnosed with AIDS, contracted through blood products used to treat his hemophilia, in 1986. After the diagnosis, he was initially tutored at home, then in isolation in a trailer on the grounds of Prather Elementary School in Granite City, Illinois. He became lonely and asked to join regular classes. After the school refused, his family filed a lawsuit and a federal court ruled in his favor under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. On his first day walking to school after the ruling, Robertson and his mother were surrounded by protesters chanting &quot;back to the trailer&quot;; a group of children from the school responded with chants supporting Jason.

In July 1988, Robertson appeared, along with AIDS activist Ryan White, at a benefit concert by Elton John Robertson&#x27;s family found that the environment in Granite City remained hostile—-on one occasion Robertson&#x27;s mother was struck in the head by a man unhappy about him returning to school in the fall—-and the family decided to move. They relocated to South Roxana, Illinois, where the school district agreed to treat Jason as a regular student, and (despite some limited protests) the community reception was more accepting.

Robertson died in 2003 at age 23, some time after he had decided to stop taking his medication for HIV because it had begun to worsen his hemophilia. The &quot;Associated Press&quot; story about his death described him as &quot;a symbol of the fight against AIDS discrimination&quot; who &quot;helped other children with the virus overcome its stigma&quot;.

Strong has earned Annie Award and Daytime Emmy nominations and won an award from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

==Early life==
Strong was born as Tara Lyn Charendoff in Toronto, Ontario, on February 12, 1973, the younger daughter of Syd and Lucy Charendoff. Strong has called her Jewish background &quot;a big part of her identity&quot;. She has an older sister named Marla. At age four, Strong became interested in acting and volunteered to be a soloist at a school production. She worked in Yiddish Theatre in Toronto, where she memorized her lines phonetically because she did not know the Yiddish language. Strong also performed with the Toronto Jewish Theater, where she acted in &quot;A Night of Stars&quot; and was featured in an audiotape for &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot; with the Habonim Youth Choir, singing the lyrics in both English and Hebrew.

==Career==

Strong&#x27;s first professional role was Gracie in Limelight Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;The Music Man&quot; at the age of 13. She had a guest role in the action series &quot;T. and T.&quot; Her first major cartoon role, also at the age of 13, was the title role in &quot;Hello Kitty&#x27;s Furry Tale Theater&quot;. Strong starred in the short-lived CBC Television sitcom &quot;Mosquito Lake&quot;. She took improv classes at The Second City in Toronto and continued acting in both animated and live-action shows and films, before moving to Los Angeles in January 1994.

Strong is the voice of numerous animated characters, including main roles in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; as Barbara Gordon/Batgirl, &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; as Raven; &quot;Fillmore!&quot; as Ingrid Third; &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; as Timmy Turner (Strong took over the role after the suicide of the original voice actress Mary Kay Bergman—the two were close friends) and Poof; &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; as Dil Pickles; &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; as Bubbles; &quot;Ben 10&quot; as Ben Tennyson, Upgrade, Blitzwolfer, and Buzzshock; &quot;Chowder&quot; as Truffles; &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; as Terrence; the singing voice of Meg Griffin and additional voices on &quot;Family Guy&quot;; &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot; as Twilight Sparkle, &quot;Unikitty!&quot; as the titular princess, &quot;Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!&quot; as Daizy, and &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot; as Joanni.

While recording lines for her role as Dil in &quot;Rugrats&quot;, one scene&#x27;s script for Strong&#x27;s character prompted her to make crying noises. During the taping, the producers suddenly paused and revealed to Strong that her voice acting of a child had been so realistic that she had inadvertently made a woman in the studio lactate. As the role was otherwise going to be offered to Madonna, Strong subsequently quipped that she was proud that the incident led to her keeping the role.

She has also lent her voice to English-dubbed localizations of Japanese anime such as &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, as well as several video games, including her work as Elisa and Ursula in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot;; Paz Ortega Andrade in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes&quot;, and &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;; Rikku in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, its sequel &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;; Krista Sparks in &quot;Twisted Metal: Head-On&quot;; Talwyn Apogee in &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Quest for Booty&quot;; Keira in &quot;Jak and Daxter series&quot;; and Juliet Starling, the main character of &quot;Lollipop Chainsaw&quot;. She also has a minor voiceover for the teddy bear Ted in the motion picture &quot;Ted&quot;. In &quot;Blue Dragon&quot;, she is the voice actor for Kluke for the Xbox 360 game, but not in the anime series.

Beginning with the video game &quot;&quot;, Strong would also succeed Arleen Sorkin as the voice of Harley Quinn.

She has appeared in live roles in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Senior Trip&quot;, &quot;Sabrina Goes to Rome&quot;, &quot;Sabrina Down Under&quot;, and &quot;The Last White Dishwasher&quot;. She also made guest appearances on such shows as &quot;Forever Knight&quot;, &quot;Street Legal&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Take Home Chef&quot;, &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;Comic Book: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot;, &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; and &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. In January 2013, she voiced the character Plum in Cartoon Hangover&#x27;s &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;, created by Pendleton Ward. She recurred as Miss Collins in Nickelodeon&#x27;s live-action series &quot;Big Time Rush&quot; from 2010 to 2013.

In 2004, she won an Interactive Achievement Award for her role as Rikku in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;. She also served as the announcer for the 1999 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, appeared as a guest panelist at several fan conventions (including BotCon, Jacon, Comic-Con International, and Anime Overdose), and was featured on the front cover of the July/August 2004 issue of &quot;Working Mother&quot; magazine, in which she said, &quot;My son is now old enough to respond to my work. To me, that&#x27;s what it is all about.&quot; Strong has been nominated five times for Annie Awards.

In 2013, Strong won the Shorty Award for &quot;Best Actress&quot; for her use of social media. The Behind the Voice Actors website selected her for a BTVA Voice Acting Award for Voice Actress of the Year for 2013, having nominated her for 2011 and 2012.

Strong starred in the Canadian series &quot;Pretty Hard Cases&quot; as Tiggy Sullivan, the head of a drug trafficking gang. She also voices Miss Minutes in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe series &quot;Loki&quot;.

===Dismissal from &quot;Boxtown&quot; cast===
After the 2023 Israel–Hamas war began, Strong stated that Hamas had &quot;brainwashed the western world&quot; to support terrorism. She also stated that people can &quot;help Palestine without supporting terrorism&quot; and expressed support for Israel.

Strong&#x27;s posts and likes on others&#x27; posts relating to the war on Twitter garnered controversy, particularly her opinions on the government of Israel&#x27;s bombing of the Gaza Strip, in which she praised the bombings, stating, &quot;This is only the beginning,&quot; and calling it &quot;smart&quot;. The comments led independent animation studio Bandit Mill Animation to remove her from the production of their upcoming series &quot;Boxtown&quot; and recast a role for a character she would have voiced. They explained on their official Twitter page that &quot;this decision was due to a trend among Tara&#x27;s recent online activity, including posts that promote controversial messages regarding the peoples of Palestine currently being affected by the ongoing Israel-Palestine crisis.&quot;

After her removal, Strong claimed that she was &quot;fired for being Jewish&quot;. This was denied by a co-writer of &quot;Boxtown&quot; pilot, Spencer Rothbell, who pointed out that several &quot;Boxtown&quot; cast and crew members are Jewish, including himself and voice actor Alex Hirsch, the latter whom is voicing a lead character in the series.

==Personal life==
In 1999, Strong met U.S. real estate agent and former actor Craig Strong. The couple married on May 14, 2000, and have two sons named Sammy (b. February 2002) and Aden (b. August 2004). They lived in Los Angeles and were formerly the owners of VoiceStarz, an online company that taught people how to get into the voice-over business. On July 24, 2019, she filed for divorce, which was finalized on January 5, 2022. That same year, she started dating social media entrepreneur Willie Morris who runs Happy Goat Farm, a farmland based in Yosemite.

Strong is a vegan. In 2012, during the BronyCon event in New Jersey, she attended a lunch with fans from the military. In 2013, she was involved with a charity group called Bronies for Good, helping them raise funds for a family whose daughter had a brain tumor.

<text>Neil Patrick Jordan (born 25 February 1950) is an Irish film director, screenwriter, novelist and short-story writer. He first achieved recognition for his short story collection, &quot;Night in Tunisia,&quot; which won the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1979. After a stint working at RTÉ, he made his directorial debut with the 1982 film &quot;Angel&quot;. 

Jordan&#x27;s best-known films include the crime thrillers &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Crying Game&quot; (1992), the horror dramas &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994) and &quot;Byzantium&quot; (2012), the biopic &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996), the black comedy &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot; (1997), the Graham Greene adaptation &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; (1999), the transgender-themed dramedy &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; (2005), and the psychological thriller &quot;Greta&quot; (2018). Jordan also created the Showtime Network television series &quot;The Borgias&quot; (2011–2013) and Sky Atlantic&#x27;s &quot;Riviera&quot; (2017–2020). 

He is the recipient of numerous accolades for his film work, including an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards, three IFTA Film &amp; Drama Awards, a Golden Lion and a Silver Bear. In 1996, he was honoured with receiving the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

==Early life and education==
Jordan was born in Sligo, the son of Angela (née O&#x27;Brien), a painter, and Michael Jordan, a professor. He was educated at St. Paul&#x27;s College, Raheny. Later, Jordan attended University College Dublin, where he studied Irish history and English literature. He graduated in 1972 with a BA in History. He became involved in student theatre there, where he met Jim Sheridan, who also was later to become an important Irish film director. After graduation, in 1976 Jordan produced his first collection of short stories: &quot;Night in Tunisia and other Stories&quot;. 

Of his religious background, Jordan said in a 1999 &quot;Salon&quot; interview: &quot;I was brought up a Catholic and was quite religious at one stage in my life, when I was young. But it left me with no scars whatever; it just sort of vanished.&quot; He said about his current beliefs that &quot;God is the greatest imaginary being of all time. Along with Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity, the invention of God is probably the greatest creation of human thought.&quot;

==Career==
Jordan&#x27;s career began in the late 1970s working for the Irish television channel RTÉ. His work included writing storylines for the children&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;Wanderly Wagon&quot;. His first collection of short stories, &quot;Night in Tunisia&quot;, was published by Dublin&#x27;s Irish Writers Co-operative in 1976. It won the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1979.

In 1981, when John Boorman was filming &quot;Excalibur&quot; in Ireland, he recruited Jordan as a &quot;creative associate&quot;. A year later, Boorman was executive producer on Jordan&#x27;s first feature &quot;Angel&quot;, a tale of a musician caught up in the Troubles played by Stephen Rea who has subsequently appeared in almost all of Jordan&#x27;s films to date. During the 1980s, he directed films that won him acclaim, including &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, both made in England. &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot;, a dark and sexually-themed reimagining of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale based on short stories by Angela Carter, became a cult favourite.

As a writer/director, Jordan has a highly idiosyncratic body of work, ranging from mainstream hits like &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; to commercial failures like &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; to a variety of more personal, low-budget arthouse pictures. He was also the driving force behind the cable TV series &quot;The Borgias&quot;.
Unconventional sexual relationships are a recurring theme in Jordan&#x27;s work, and he often finds a sympathetic side to characters that audiences would traditionally consider deviant or downright horrifying. His film &quot;The Miracle&quot;, for instance, follows two characters who struggle to resist a strong, incestuous attraction. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, like the Anne Rice book it was based on, focused on the intense, intimate interpersonal relationship of two undead men who murder humans nightly (although the pair never have sex, they are clearly lovers of a sort), accompanied by an equally complex vampire woman who is eternally trapped in the body of a little girl. While Lestat (Tom Cruise) is depicted in an attractive but villainous manner, his partner Louis (Brad Pitt) and the child vampire Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) are meant to capture the audience&#x27;s sympathy despite their predatory nature. In the remake of &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;, two people (Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore) engage in a love affair that will end as suddenly as it started, with both not wanting its end.

In addition to the unusual sexuality of Jordan&#x27;s films, he frequently returns to the Troubles of Northern Ireland. &quot;The Crying Game&quot; and &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; both concern a transgender character (played by Jaye Davidson and Cillian Murphy, respectively), both concern The Troubles and both feature frequent Jordan leading man Stephen Rea. The two films, however, are very different, with &quot;The Crying Game&quot; being a realistic thriller/romance, and &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; is a much more episodic, stylised, darkly comic biography. Jordan also frequently tells stories about children or young people, such as &quot;The Miracle&quot; and &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;. While his pictures are most often grounded in reality, he occasionally directs more fantastic or dreamlike films, such as &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot;, &quot;High Spirits&quot;, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; and &quot;In Dreams&quot;.
The critical success of Jordan&#x27;s early pictures led him to Hollywood, where he directed &quot;High Spirits&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot;; both were critical and financial disasters. He later returned home to make the more personal &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, which was nominated for six Academy Awards. Jordan won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film. Its unexpected success led him back to American studio filmmaking, where he directed &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. He also directed the crime drama &quot;The Brave One&quot; starring Jodie Foster.

Neil Gaiman announced during his &quot;Today&quot; show appearance on 27 January 2009, that Neil Jordan would be directing the film of his Newbery Medal-winning book &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot;. Jordan also wrote and directed the 2009 Irish-made film &quot;Ondine&quot;, starring Colin Farrell and Alicja Bachleda-Curuś. He also directed &quot;Byzantium&quot;, an adaptation of the vampire play of the same name starring Saoirse Ronan, Gemma Arterton and Jonny Lee Miller.

In 2011, Jordan&#x27;s next feature was announced as the later aborted sci-fi romance &quot;Broken Dream&quot;, which was to have featured Ben Kingsley and John Hurt.

He directed the thriller &quot;Greta&quot; (2018), starring Isabelle Huppert and Chloë Grace Moretz.

After working on the scripts for &quot;Riviera&quot;, Jordan has disowned the show, due to his scripts being reworked by others. He said he had no idea who rewrote these episodes. &quot;They were changed, to my huge surprise and considerable upset. There were various sexual scenes introduced into the story and a lot of very expository dialogue. I objected in the strongest terms possible.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Jordan has five children: Anna and Sarah from his marriage to solicitor Vivienne Shields; Dashiel and Daniel from his current marriage to Brenda Rawn, and Ben, from a relationship with architect Mary Donohoe. Jordan lives in Dalkey, Dublin.

In 1996, Neil Jordan was honoured with receiving the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He has received many honorary doctorates, most notably from Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

In 2009, he signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after he was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

In 2018, he donated his archives to the National Library of Ireland. Jordan&#x27;s donation included TV and film scripts, production files, notebooks, storyboards and personal correspondence with artists and political figures.

<doc id="315571" wikidata="Q774960" url="?curid=315571" title="Blowpipe (missile)">
<text>The Shorts Blowpipe is a man-portable (MANPADS) surface-to-air missile that was in use with the British Army and Royal Marines from 1975 to 1985. It also saw service in other military forces around the world. Most examples were retired by the mid-1990s. It is unique among MANPADS in that it is manually guided to its target with a small joystick, sending guidance corrections to the missile over a radio control link.

Blowpipe underwent a protracted and controversial development between the programme&#x27;s initial conception in 1966 and 1975 when it finally entered service. It had its first use during active combat in the Falklands War in 1982 when it was used by both sides of the conflict. Its demonstrated performance was poor, with only two confirmed kills.

As a result of the poor performance of the system, an improved version offering semi-automatic guidance was introduced as Javelin. This was further improved with a laser designator system in Javelin S15, which was later renamed Starburst. Both Javelin systems were used only briefly before being replaced by the dramatically more powerful Starstreak in the 1990s.

Several advanced variants and alternative launchers, including a submarine-based system, did not see production. Approximately 35,000 missiles were produced in total.

==History==
===Development===
Short Brothers began researching a man-portable anti-aircraft system in 1962 as a private venture (i.e. without any government orders or funding), with engineering starting in 1964. In 1966, the Ministry of Defence awarded them a development contract as part of an effort to acquire a MANPADS system. Whether or not there was a need for such a weapon was constantly debated, with the Secretary of State for Defence stating as late as 1968 that the question remained open. Ultimately, the decision was made in 1968 to start development of the Shorts proposal, which won the contract specifically because it was believed to be the least expensive option.

To reduce cost, Shorts&#x27; design did not include a guidance system on the missile. Instead, the guidance was on the launcher, which communicated with the missile using a simple radio command system. This meant the missile itself had fewer components, and expensive components, such as a seeker head, were not expended when firing. Shorts, additionally, claimed that this system made it suitable for head-on engagements, while infrared homing systems of the era, like the FIM-43 Redeye, were only useful in tail-chase engagements where the missile&#x27;s short-range and slow speed led to performance that was significantly lower than initially specified.

Concerns about the control fins at the front of the missile led to one of the distinguishing features of Blowpipe. It was considered to be a difficult problem to make movable control fins that also folded for storage so the decision was made to have the guidance fins unfoldable. This required the forward section of the launcher to be large enough to hold them in their flight positions, which leads to the seemingly oversized cylinder at the front of the launcher. The rear fins, used for stabilization only, are placed at the rear of this cylinder on a separate ring, and the missile flies through it until they reach the end of the fuselage where the ring locks into place. As they exit the tube, the tips of the rear fins fold out further.

The programme immediately ran into problems. On 7 May 1969, Minister of Defence for Equipment Sir John Morris in Parliament claimed that the Blowpipe&#x27;s development was &quot;...proceeding satisfactorily but is at too early a stage for any firm production order.&quot; Two years later, on 11 February 1971, Minister of State for Defence Robert Lindsay noted that &quot;The development programme for this missile continues to make progress although it will still be some time before it is completed. It would be contrary to normal policy to give detailed forecasts of the Forces&#x27; production requirements.&quot; On 16 March 1972, Under-Secretary for Defence for the Army Geoffrey Johnson-Smith said of Blowpipe &quot;This is now in an advanced stage of development and some successful trials with it have been carried out. It, too, should be in service in about two years&#x27; time.&quot;

In June 1973, an order for 100 launchers was received from the Canadian Army. As an industrial offset, Shorts would use the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT-6 engine on their Shorts 330 30-passenger airliner.

A low-rate production contract was finally signed in September of that year. On 24 July 1973 it was stated that the system was still undergoing flight tests and ground tests, which were not officially completed until 1975. The missile entered service later that year. On 10 June 1976, further controversy sparked when it was revealed the Royal Air Force (RAF) was reluctant to use the weapon in test launches because of its high cost, limiting training to only two launches per year. By 1979, only half the units slated to receive Blowpipe actually had them.

After Blowpipe began to enter service, it was decided it would replace the Bofors 40mm/L70 guns in service with the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve. The first such unit was formed in July 1978 in Northern Ireland. In February 1980 it was decided to increase the number of such units, and a further £20 million order was placed to equip another 12 units, bringing the total to 48.

===Variants===
After requests from the Israeli and Brazilian navies for a submarine-launched weapon, Blowpipe was developed in a cluster of six missiles on a mast that could be raised from the submarine&#x27;s conning tower. Known as &quot;Submarine Launched Airflight Missile&quot;, or SLAM, the system was trialled on the World War II-era HMS &quot;Aeneas&quot; in 1972. These were for a time installed on Israeli &quot;Gal&quot; class submarines but later removed. The Brazilians never installed the system.

A four-round launcher similar to the one developed for SLAM was also considered for mounting on the M113 and FV103 Spartan APC&#x27;s, but it is unclear if either reached trials. The programmes were officially ended in June 1981. The basic concept was later re-introduced as the three-round &quot;Lightweight Multiple Launchers&quot; (LML) for Blowpipe or Javelin. A larger five-round mount was later offered as &quot;Sea Javelin&quot;.

As part of the contract for a new portable SAM for the US Army, Northrop joined forces with Shorts to produce a version of Blowpipe with a laser seeker, which would automate missile guidance. This contract was won by the General Dynamics FIM-92 Stinger. This was the guidance system that was ultimately used by Starburst.

==Description==

The missile is supplied as a single round in a storage cylinder/firing tube. The aiming unit is clipped to the launch tube and fired from the operator&#x27;s shoulder. To reduce the overall size of the container, the rear fins of the missile are stored in the larger diameter cylinder at the front of the tube (this also contains the Yagi antenna for transmitting guidance signals); during firing, the fins slip onto the rear of the missile as it flies through and are held there by heat-activated adhesive tapes. This gives the launch container a unique shape, seemingly oversized at the front and extremely thin at the rear. The missile is powered by a short duration solid rocket for launch, then by a sustainer motor once it is well clear of the launch tube.

The Blowpipe&#x27;s guidance is initially semi-automatic with the missile gathered to the centre of the sight&#x27;s crosshairs by the infrared optic atop the aiming unit. Two to three seconds after launch, missile guidance is switched to fully MCLOS mode and the operator regains full control of the missile. The operator has to steer the missile all the way to its target manually via a small thumb joystick. The operator can opt not to use auto-gathering when engaging low flying targets such as helicopters but then has to super-elevate the launcher to ensure that the missile does not hit the ground. Four flares in the tail of the missile make it visible in flight, first to the infrared optic, then to the operator. Detonation is either by proximity or contact fuse. In emergencies, the operator can end an engagement by shutting off the power to the transmitter with the system switch, after which the missile will immediately self-destruct. The aiming unit can then be removed from the empty missile container and fitted to a new round.

==Combat performance==
Blowpipe was used by both sides during the Falklands War in 1982. With the targets being fast-flying aircraft, flying low and using the ground to hide their approach, the Blowpipe operator had about 20 seconds to spot the target, align the unit and fire. Brigadier Julian Thompson compared using the weapon to &quot;trying to shoot pheasants with a drainpipe&quot;. During the conflict, British forces fired 95 missiles, of which approximately half suffered failures of various kinds. A later report determined only one kill could be attributed with certainty to Blowpipe, that of an Argentine Navy Aermacchi MB-339 (0766 (4-A-114)) during the Battle of Goose Green on 28 May. Blowpipe was also used on the Argentine side, with one British Harrier GR3 (XZ972) being claimed by Argentine Army 601 Commando Company, though the pilot believed he was hit by anti-aircraft guns.

Blowpipe was found to be particularly ineffective when used to engage a crossing target or to chase a target moving rapidly away from the operator. Its poor performance led to it being withdrawn from British service. In 1986, some of the mothballed units were sent clandestinely to equip the Mujahideen whom Britain was supporting, fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan. The system again proved ineffective, and was eventually supplanted by the US Stinger missile. While Blowpipe was available on the international arms market and therefore its origins were open to speculation, the Stinger was restricted, which at the time indicated a more open acknowledgement of Western support for the Mujahideen. Blowpipe missile systems were still being found in weapon caches as recently as May 2012 in Afghanistan.

The Canadian military took Blowpipe from storage to provide protection for their naval contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, although age had degraded the weapons, and nine out of 27 missiles tested misfired. The Javelin GL, which was backward compatible to the Blowpipe, was then hastily purchased as a replacement.

Blowpipe saw use in the Cenepa War of 1995 between Ecuador and Peru, where it was deployed mainly against Peruvian Mil Mi-17 and Mil Mi-18 helicopters. Although there are claims of some success, none of these have been verified.

==Replacement==
Production of the Blowpipe ended in 1993, with an official total of 34,382 missiles and approximately 3,000 launchers produced. These numbers include test rounds. In contrast to the claimed low-cost of the system, in 1994 the missile was US$55,570, and the aiming unit approximately $94,000. This makes it much more expensive than Stinger, which was roughly $35,000 at the same time.

Blowpipe was replaced by the Javelin surface-to-air missile, which was of a generally similar design but with an improved performance and a semi-automatic guidance system (SACLOS) – the operator now controls the missile by keeping the target in his sight, and the aiming unit steers the missile to remain centred in the sight. A computer in the missile launcher calculates the difference between the current aim spot and the missile&#x27;s location and sends commands to the missile via radio to bring it to an impact point.

The basic Javelin missile body was retained in the upgraded Javelin S15, which replaced the original&#x27;s radio command guidance system with a semi-automatic laser system. This uses a laser in the launcher to &quot;paint&quot; the target, and a seeker in the missile nose cone sees the reflected signal and homes in on it. This renders it largely immune to any possible jamming. S15 was better known as Starburst, although it was known by a variety of names in service.

Starburst was used only briefly, before being replaced by Starstreak. Starstreak uses the same beam-riding concept as Starburst, but dramatically improves the missile and warhead. In Starstreak, the missile quickly accelerates to Mach 3.5, then separates to release three dart-like interceptors. Each dart is independently guided by riding the laser beam, thus improving the chances of a hit. The darts are also effective against armour.

<doc id="315572" wikidata="Q1347944" url="?curid=315572" title="Javelin (surface-to-air missile)">
<text>Javelin is a British man-portable surface-to-air missile, formerly used by the British Army and Canadian Army. It can be fired from the shoulder, or from a dedicated launcher named the Lightweight Multiple Launcher (LML), that carries three rounds, and can be vehicle mounted.

The missile is an updated version of the earlier Blowpipe of the 1970s. Blowpipe used a manual guidance system which proved hard to use effectively in combat during the Falklands War where only two destroyed aircraft could be definitively attributed to the system. Javelin replaced the manual guidance system with a semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) system that only required the operator to keep their gunsight pointed at the target. A tracking system in the launcher&#x27;s optics compared the location of the missile to the line-of-sight and sent it commands over a radio link to guide it. This version entered service in 1984, and was later known as Javelin GL.

Further upgrades to the missile added a fully automatic guidance system to produce the Javelin S-15. This was sold commercially, and is better known, as the Starburst surface-to-air missile. These began to replace the GL in British Army service in 1993, although the GL remained in use as a training system. Both were replaced by Starstreak starting around 1997.

Javelin GL was hastily purchased by the Canadian Forces to replace the Blowpipes that failed last-minute tests during preparations for the deployment to the Persian Gulf for the First Gulf War (1990–1991). It was later replaced by the Javelin S15 until retired without replacement in 2005.

==History==
The missile was developed as a replacement for the Blowpipe shoulder-launched antiaircraft missile, which was used in the Falklands War by both sides, and proved largely ineffective. Only two hits were recorded out of more than 100 launches: a British Harrier GR3 (&quot;XZ972&quot;) attacked by Argentine Army special forces (Commandos Company), and an Argentine Aermacchi MB-339 (0766 (4-A-114)) during the Battle of Goose Green.

==Operational use==
Similar in overall appearance to the manual command to line of sight (MCLOS), radio frequency guided Blowpipe, Javelin is slightly smaller, uses semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) radio frequency guidance and is fitted with an improved warhead. The operator is equipped with a 6× magnification sight and a long range television (TV) camera to locate targets. Although the Javelin&#x27;s accuracy is somewhat susceptible to smoke, fog, or clouds, it cannot be decoyed away from a target with flares because it does not use an infrared or ultraviolet (UV) spectrum seeker. It is potentially susceptible to infrared jammers such as the AN/ALQ-144.

The FGM-148 Javelin, or Advanced Anti-Tank Weapon System-Medium (AAWS-M), is an American-made man-portable anti-tank system in service since 1996 and continuously upgraded. It replaced the M47 Dragon anti-tank missile in US service. Its fire-and-forget design features automatic infrared guidance, allowing the user to seek cover immediately after launch, in contrast to wire-guided systems like the system used by the Dragon, which require a user to guide the weapon throughout the engagement. The Javelin&#x27;s high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead can defeat modern tanks by top-down attack, hitting them from above, where their armor is thinnest, and is useful against fortifications in a direct attack flight. The Javelin uses a tandem charge warhead to circumvent an enemy tank&#x27;s explosive reactive armor (ERA), which would normally render HEAT warheads ineffective.

, according to claims by the manufacturer, the Javelin had been used in around five thousand successful engagements. By August 2021, fifty thousand missiles had been delivered to customers.

The weapon made its combat debut in Iraq in 2003 and rose to prominence in the Russo-Ukrainian War, where it saw extensive usage by Ukrainian forces during the early stages of the 2022 Russian invasion.

==Overview==
Javelin is a fire-and-forget missile with lock-on before launch and automatic self-guidance. The system employs a top attack flight profile against armored vehicles, attacking the usually thinner top armor, but can also make a direct attack, for use against buildings, targets too close for top attack, targets under obstructions, and helicopters.

It can reach a peak altitude of in top attack mode and in direct attack mode. Initial versions had a range of , later increased to . It is equipped with an imaging infrared seeker. The tandem warhead is fitted with two shaped charges: a precursor warhead to detonate any explosive reactive armor and a primary warhead to penetrate base armor.

In what is known as a &quot;soft launch arrangement,&quot; the missile is ejected from the launcher to a safe distance from the operator before the main rocket motors ignite. This makes it harder to identify the launcher, though backblast from the launch tube still poses a hazard to nearby personnel. The firing team may move as soon as the &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; missile has been launched or immediately prepare to fire on their next target.
The missile system is sometimes carried by two soldiers consisting of a gunner and an ammunition bearer, although one soldier can fire it. 

==Development==
In 1983, the United States Army introduced its AAWS-M (Advanced Anti-Tank Weapon System—Medium) requirement. In 1985, the AAWS-M was approved for development. In August 1986, the proof-of-principle (POP) phase of development began, with a US$30 million contract awarded for technical proof demonstrators: Ford Aerospace (laser-beam riding), Hughes Aircraft Missile System Group (imaging infrared combined with a fiber-optic cable link) and Texas Instruments (imaging infrared). In late 1988, the POP phase ended. In June 1989, the full-scale development contract was awarded to a joint venture of Texas Instruments and Martin Marietta, now Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. The AAWS-M received the designation of FGM-148.

In April 1991, the first test-flight of the Javelin succeeded, and in March 1993, the first test-firing from the launcher succeeded. In 1994, low levels of production were authorized, and the first Javelins were deployed with US Army units in 1996.

===Test and evaluation===
The General Accounting Office (GAO), since renamed Government Accountability Office, published a report questioning the adequacy of Javelin testing. 
# involving operational testers early in development;
# use of modelling and simulation; 
# integrating development and operational testing; 
# combining testing and training.

The late-phase development of the Javelin retroactively benefited from the then-new operational test initiatives set forth by the Secretary of Defense, as well as a further test conducted as a consequence of the Army&#x27;s response to the GAO report. Before it was fielded to the 3rd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment at Fort Benning (and later Special Forces, airborne, air assault, and light infantry units), the Javelin was subjected to limited parts of the five operational test and evaluation initiatives, as well as a portability operational test program, an additional test phase of the so-called Product Verification Test, which included live firings with the full-rate configuration weapon.

The Institute for Defense Analyses and the Defense Department&#x27;s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation became involved in three development test activities, including 
# reviewing initial operational test and evaluation plans;
# monitoring initial operational test and evaluation;
# structuring follow-on test and evaluation activities.

===Qualification testing===
The Javelin Environmental Test System (JETS) is a mobile test set for Javelin All-Up-Round (AUR) and the Command Launch Unit (CLU). It can be configured to functionally test the AUR or the CLU individually or both units in a mated tactical mode. This mobile unit may be repositioned at the various environmental testing facilities. The mobile system is used for all phases of Javelin qualification testing. There is a non-mobile JETS used for stand-alone CLU testing. This system is equipped with an environmental chamber and is primarily used for Product Verification Testing (PRVT). Capabilities include: Javelin CLU testing; Javelin AUR testing; Javelin Mated Mode testing; Javelin testing in various environmental conditions; and CLU PRVT.

The all-up-round test sets include: extreme temperature testing; missile tracker testing (track rate error, tracking sensitivity); seeker/focal plane array testing (cool-down time, dead/defective pixels, seeker identification); pneumatic leakage; continuity measurements; ready time; and guidance sections (guidance commands, fin movement).

==Components==
The system consists of three main components: the Command Launch Unit, the Launch Tube Assembly and the missile itself. Each missile contains 250 microprocessors.

===Command launch unit===

The gunner carries a reusable &quot;command launch unit&quot; (CLU, pronounced &quot;clue&quot;), which is the targeting component of the two-part system. The CLU has three views, which are used to find, target, and fire the missile and may be used separately from the missile as a portable thermal sight. Infantry personnel are no longer required to stay in constant contact with armored personnel carriers and tanks with thermal sights. This makes them more flexible and able to perceive threats they would not otherwise be able to detect. In 2006, a contract was awarded to Toyon Research Corporation to begin development of an upgrade to the CLU, enabling the transmission of target image and GPS location data to other units.

====Day field of view====
The first view is a 4× magnification day view. It is mainly used to scan areas in visible light during daylight operation. It is also used to scan immediately before sunrise and after sunset, when it is difficult to focus the thermal image due to the natural rapid heating or cooling of the environment.

====Wide field of view====
The second view is the 4× magnification night view, a &quot;wide field of view&quot; (WFOV) which shows the gunner a thermal representation of the area viewed. This is the primary view used, due to its ability to detect infrared radiation and find both troops and vehicles otherwise too well hidden to detect. The screen shows a &quot;green scale&quot; view which can be adjusted in both contrast and brightness. The inside of the CLU is cooled by a small refrigeration unit attached to the sight. This greatly increases the sensitivity of the thermal imaging capability, since the temperature inside the sight is much lower than that of the objects it detects.

Due to the sensitivity this causes, the gunner is able to &quot;focus&quot; the CLU to show a detailed image of the area being viewed, by showing temperature differences of only a few degrees. The gunner operates this view with the use of two hand stations similar to the control stick found in modern cockpits. It is from this view that the gunner focuses the image and determines the area that gives the best heat signature on which to lock the missile.

====Narrow field of view====
The third field of view is a 12× thermal sight, used to better identify the target vehicle. Once the CLU has been focused in WFOV, the gunner may switch to a &quot;narrow field of view&quot; (NFOV) for target recognition before activating the &quot;seeker FOV&quot;.

Once the best target area is chosen, the gunner presses one of the two triggers and is automatically switched to the fourth view, the &quot;seeker FOV&quot;, which is a 9x magnification thermal view. This process is similar to the automatic zoom feature on most modern cameras. This view is available along with the previously mentioned views, all of which may be accessed with the press of a button. However, it is not as commonly-used as a high magnification view, because it takes longer to scan a wide area.

This view allows the gunner to further aim the missile and set the guidance system housed inside it. It is when in this view that information is passed from the CLU, through the connection electronics of the Launch Tube Assembly, and into the missile&#x27;s guidance system. If the gunner decides not to fire the missile immediately, they can cycle back to the other views without firing. When the gunner is satisfied with the target picture, a second trigger is pulled to establish a &quot;lock&quot;. The missile launches after a short delay.

====Lightweight CLU====
The US Army developed a new CLU as an improvement over the Block I version. The new CLU is 70% smaller, 40% lighter and has a 50% battery life increase. Features of the lightweight CLU are: a long-wave infrared (IR) thermographic camera; a high-definition display with improved resolution; integrated handgrips; a five megapixel color camera; a laser point that can be seen visibly or through IR; a far target locator using GPS, a laser rangefinder, a heading sensor, and modernized electronics. The LW CLU has demonstrated the ability to fire a FIM-92 Stinger anti-aircraft missile, using its superior optics to identify and destroy small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Compared to the Block I Command Launch Unit (CLU), the Lightweight CLU will double target identification range and increase system engagement range from 2.5 kilometers (km) to 4 km.

The Javelin Joint Venture received its first low-rate production contract for the LW CLU in June 2022. 200 units will be delivered before full-rate production is expected to initiate in 2023, which will increase the production rate to 600 per year. First delivery is slated for 2025.

===Launch Tube Assembly===
Both the gunner and the ammunition bearer carry the Launch Tube Assembly, a disposable tube that houses the missile and protects the missile from harsh environments. The tube has built-in electronics and a locking hinge system that makes attachment and detachment of the missile to and from the Command Launch Unit a quick and simple process.

===Missile===

====Warhead====

The Javelin missile&#x27;s tandem warhead is a high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) type. This round utilizes an explosive shaped charge to create a stream of superplastically deformed metal, formed from trumpet-shaped metallic liners. The result is a narrow high velocity particle stream that can penetrate armor.

The Javelin counters the advent of explosive reactive armor (ERA). ERA boxes or tiles lying over a vehicle&#x27;s main armor explode when struck by a warhead. This explosion does not harm the vehicle&#x27;s main armor, but causes steel panels to fly across the path of a HEAT round&#x27;s narrow particle stream, disrupting its focus and leaving it unable to cut through the main armor. The Javelin uses two shaped-charge warheads in tandem. The weak, smaller diameter HEAT precursor charge detonates the ERA, clearing the way for the much larger diameter HEAT warhead, which then penetrates the target&#x27;s primary armor.

A two-layered molybdenum liner is used for the precursor, and a copper liner for the main warhead.

To protect the main charge from the explosive blast, shock, and debris caused by the impact of the missile&#x27;s nose and the detonation of the precursor charge, a blast shield is used between the two charges. This was the first composite material blast shield and the first that had a hole through the middle to provide a jet that is less diffuse.

A newer main charge liner produces a higher velocity jet. While making the warhead smaller, this change makes it more effective, leaving more room for propellant for the main rocket motor, increasing the missile&#x27;s range.

Electronic arming and fusing, called Electronic Safe Arming and Fire (ESAF), is present on the Javelin. The ESAF system enables the firing and arming process to proceed, while imposing a series of safety checks on the missile. ESAF cues the launch motor after the trigger is pulled. When the missile reaches a key acceleration point, indicating that it has cleared the launch tube, the ESAF initiates a second arming signal to fire the flight motor. After another check on missile conditions (target lock check), ESAF initiates final arming to enable the warheads for detonation upon target impact. When the missile strikes the target, ESAF enables the tandem warhead function, to provide appropriate time between the detonation of the precursor charge and the detonation of the main charge.

Though the Javelin&#x27;s tandem HEAT warhead has proven efficient at destroying tanks, most threats it was employed against in Iraq and Afghanistan were weapon crews and teams, buildings, and lightly armored and unarmored vehicles. To make the Javelin more useful in these scenarios, the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center developed a multi-purpose warhead (MPWH) for the FGM-148F. While it is still lethal against tanks, the new warhead has a naturally fragmenting steel warhead case, that doubles the effectiveness against personnel due to enhanced fragmentation. The MPWH does not add weight or cost and has a lighter composite missile mid-body to enable drop-in replacement to existing Javelin tubes. The Javelin F-model was planned to begin deliveries in early 2020. The improved missile design, along with new lighter CLU with an improved target tracker, entered production in May 2020.

====Propulsion====
Most rocket launchers require a large clear area behind the gunner to prevent injury from backblast. To address this shortcoming without increasing recoil to an unacceptable level, the Javelin system uses a soft launch mechanism. A small launch motor using conventional rocket propellant ejects the missile from the launcher, but stops burning before the missile clears the tube. The flight motor is ignited after a delay to allow sufficient clearance from the operator.

To save weight, the two motors are integrated with a burst disc between them. It is designed to tolerate the pressure of the launch motor from one side, but to easily rupture from the other when the flight motor ignites. The motors use a common nozzle. The flight motor&#x27;s exhaust flows through the expended launch motor. Because the launch motor casing remains in place, an unusual ring-shaped igniter is used to start it. A normal igniter would be blown out of the back of the missile when the flight motor ignited and could injure the operator.

Since the launch motor uses a standard NATO propellant, the presence of lead beta-resorcylate as a burn rate modifier causes an amount of lead and lead oxide to be present in the exhaust. Gunners are asked to hold their breath after firing for their safety.

In the event that the launch motor malfunctions and the launch tube is overpressurized—for example, if the rocket gets stuck—the Javelin missile includes a pressure release system to prevent the launcher from exploding. The launch motor is held in place by a set of shear pins, which fracture if the pressure rises too high. They allow the motor to be pushed out of the back of the tube.

====Seeker====
As a fire-and-forget missile, after launch the missile has to be able to track and destroy its target without assistance from the gunner. This is done by coupling an onboard imaging IR system, separate from CLU imaging system, with an onboard tracking system.

The gunner uses the CLU&#x27;s IR system to find and identify the target, then switches to the missile&#x27;s independent IR system to set a track box around the target and establish a lock. The gunner places brackets around the image for locking.

The seeker stays focused on the target&#x27;s image, continuing to track it as the target moves or the missile&#x27;s flight path alters, or attack angles change. The seeker consists of three main components: focal plane array image sensor, cooling and calibration, and stabilization.

====Focal plane array (FPA)====

The seeker assembly is encased in a dome that is transparent to long-wave infrared radiation. The IR radiation passes through the dome and then through lenses that focus the energy. The IR energy is reflected by mirrors on to the FPA. The seeker is a two-dimensional staring FPA of 64×64 MerCad (HgCdTe) detector elements. The FPA processes the signals from the detectors and relays a signal to the missile&#x27;s tracker.

The staring array is a photo-voltaic device where the incident photons stimulate electrons and are stored, pixel by pixel, in readout integrated circuits attached at the rear of the detector. These electrons are converted to voltages that are multiplexed out of the ROIC on a frame-by-frame basis.

====Cooling/calibration====
To function effectively, the FPA must be cooled and calibrated. In other applications, a CLU&#x27;s IR detectors are cooled using a Dewar flask and a closed-cycle Stirling engine, but there is insufficient space in the missile for a similar solution. Prior to launch, a cooler mounted on the outside of the launch tube activates the electrical systems in the missile, and supplies cold gas from a Joule-Thomson expander to the missile detector assembly, while the missile is still in the launch tube. When the missile is fired, this external connection is broken and coolant gas is supplied internally by an onboard argon gas bottle. The gas is held in a small bottle at high pressure and contains enough coolant for the duration of the flight of approximately 19 seconds.

The seeker is calibrated using a chopper wheel. This device is a fan of six blades: five black blades with low IR emissivity and one semi-reflective blade. These blades spin in front of the seeker optics in a synchronized fashion such that the FPA is continually provided with points of reference in addition to viewing the scene. These reference points allow the FPA to reduce noise introduced by response variations in the detector elements.

====Stabilization====
The platform on which the seeker is mounted must be stabilized with respect to the motion of the missile body, and the seeker must be moved to stay aligned with the target. The stabilization system must cope with rapid acceleration, up/down and lateral movements. This is done by a gimbal system, accelerometers, spinning-mass gyros (or MEMS), and motors to drive changes in position of the platform. The system is basically an autopilot. Information from the gyros is fed to the guidance electronics, which drive a torque motor attached to the seeker platform to keep the seeker aligned with the target. The wires that connect the seeker with the rest of the missile are carefully designed to avoid inducing motion or drag on the seeker platform.

====Tracker====
The tracker is key to guidance/control for an eventual hit. The signals from each of the 4,096 detector elements (64×64 pixel array) in the seeker are passed to the FPA readout integrated circuits which reads then creates a video frame that is sent to the tracker system for processing. By comparing the individual frames, the tracker determines the need to correct so as to keep the missile on target. The tracker must be able to determine which portion of the image represents the target.

The target is initially defined by the gunner, who places a configurable frame around it. The tracker then uses algorithms to compare that region of the frame based on image, geometric, and movement data to the new image frames being sent from the seeker, similar to pattern recognition algorithms. At the end of each frame, the reference is updated. The tracker is able to keep track of the target even though the seeker&#x27;s point of view can change radically in the course of flight.

The missile is equipped with four movable tail fins and eight fixed wings at mid-body. To guide the missile, the tracker locates the target in the current frame and compares this position with the aim point. If this position is off center, the tracker computes a correction and passes it to the guidance system, which makes the appropriate adjustments to the four movable tail fins. This is an autopilot. To guide the missile, the system has sensors that check that the fins are positioned as requested. If not, the deviation is sent back to the controller for further adjustment. This is a closed-loop controller.

There are three stages in the flight managed by the tracker: 1) an initial phase just after launch; 2) a mid-flight phase that lasts for most of the flight; and 3) a terminal phase in which the tracker selects the most effective point of impact. With guidance algorithms, the autopilot uses data from the seeker and tracker, to determine when to transition the missile from one phase of flight to another. Depending on whether the missile is in top attack or direct attack mode, the profile of the flight can change significantly. 

The top attack mode requires the missile to climb sharply after launch and cruise at high altitude, then dive on the top of the target (curveball). In direct attack mode (fastball), the missile cruises at a lower altitude directly at the target. The flight path takes into account the range to the target, calculated by the guidance unit.

==Training==

A great familiarity of each control and swift operation needs to be achieved before the unit can be deployed efficiently. American troops are trained on the system at the Infantry School in Fort Moore, Georgia, for two weeks. The soldiers are taught basic care and maintenance, operation and abilities, assembly and disassembly, and the positions it can be fired from. Soldiers are taught to distinguish between a variety of vehicle types, even when only a rough outline is visible.

The soldiers must accomplish several timed drills with set standards, before being qualified to operate the system in both training and wartime situations. There are smaller training programs set up on most army bases that instruct soldiers on the proper use of the system. At these courses, the training program might be changed in small ways. This is most commonly only minor requirements left out due to budget, the number of soldiers vs. simulation equipment, and available time and resources. Both types of training courses have required proficiency levels that must be met before the soldier can operate the system in training exercises or wartime missions.

== Combat history ==
The Javelin was used by the US Army, the US Marine Corps and the Australian Special Forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, on Iraqi Type 69 and Lion of Babylon tanks. During the Battle of Debecka Pass, a platoon of US Army Special Forces operators equipped with Javelins destroyed two T-55 tanks, eight armored personnel carriers, and four troop transport trucks.
During the War in Afghanistan, the Javelin was used effectively in counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. The Javelin filled a niche in US weapons systems against DShK heavy machine guns and B-10 recoilless rifles—weapons like the AT4 and the M203 grenade launcher were powerful enough, but the ~300 m range was insufficient. Conversely, while medium and heavy machine guns and automatic grenade launchers had the range, they lacked the power, and heavy mortars, which had both a good range and more than enough power, were not accurate enough.

The Javelin had enough range, power, and accuracy for dismounted infantry to counter standoff engagement tactics employed by enemy weapons. With good locks, the missile is most effective against vehicles, caves, fortified positions, and individual personnel. If enemy forces were inside a cave, a Javelin fired into the mouth of the cave would destroy it from the inside, which was not possible from the outside using heavy mortars. The psychological effect of the sound of a Javelin firing, sometimes caused insurgents to disengage and flee their position. Even when not firing, the Javelin&#x27;s CLU was commonly used as a man-portable surveillance system.

In February 2016, during the al-Shaddadi offensive of the Syrian Civil War, a Javelin was used to blow up an attacking suicide car bomb.

In 2016, claims were posted on social media that the Syrian Kurdish People&#x27;s Protection Units (YPG) may have received Javelin missiles. By June 2018, it was still unconfirmed if the YPG were fielding Javelin missiles, although US Special Forces units were seen operating them in support of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) advances during the Deir ez-Zor campaign in the Middle Euphrates River Valley.

In June 2019, forces of the Libyan Government of National Accord captured four Javelins from the forces of the Libyan National Army. These missiles had been provided by the UAE.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO provided thousands of Javelins to Ukraine, where they proved highly effective. Javelins have been responsible for a part of the hundreds of Russian armored vehicles that Ukraine has destroyed, captured or damaged. An image dubbed &quot;Saint Javelin&quot;, which shows the Virgin Mary holding a Javelin launcher in the style of an Eastern Orthodox church painting, gained social media attention, and soon became a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance against the Russian invasion. The Pentagon claimed that of the first 112 Javelins fired by the Ukrainians since the start of the war, 100 missiles had hit their target.

An unknown number of Javelin launch tube assemblies were captured by the Russian armed forces during the conflict. It is unclear if any of the captured launchers contained live rounds, or were simply tubes discarded after being used. Iran reportedly received an example of the Javelin missile from Russia, along with other Western munitions captured in Ukraine, as part of a larger deal for Shahed and Mohajer drones.

In April 2022 commentary from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), concerns were raised over the US stock of Javelin missiles. According to CSIS, the US had used close to one-third of its Javelin missiles. 7,000 had been supplied, with the United States buying Javelins at the rate of about 1,000 a year. The maximum production rate is 6,480 a year, but it would likely take a year or more to reach that level. Orders take 32 months to deliver. The report concluded that it would take about three or four years to replace the missiles that had been sent to Ukraine. The missile production rate could be increased greatly with a national procurement effort. 

In May 2022, Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet stated that Lockheed would nearly double the production of Javelins to 4,000 a year. Ukrainian officials estimated that up to 500 missiles per day were being used in the early days of the war. In August 2022, the US committed to sending an additional 1,000 Javelin missiles to Ukraine.

<doc id="315576" wikidata="Q7719712" url="?curid=315576" title="The Boyne Water">
<text>&quot;The Boyne Water&quot; is an Ulster Protestant folksong by an anonymous lyricist. The lyrics of the song commemorate King William III of Orange&#x27;s victory over James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, part of the Williamite War in Ireland.

==Background==
Unionists point to the Battle of the Boyne as decisive in achieving a constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom. Modern historians also agree that this conflict, otherwise known as the Glorious Revolution and played out in Scotland as well, was the conclusion of the English Civil War of 1642–1651 Indeed, King James II as a very young Duke of York was present with his father Charles at the Battle of Edge Hill in 1642.

The lyrics of the song narrate the course of the Battle of the Boyne. It mentions real events such as the death of the Duke of Schomberg, William of Orange&#x27;s leading the Enniskillen cavalry across the River Boyne, and the Williamite infantry&#x27;s repulse of the Jacobite cavalry&#x27;s counter-attacks. The song also expresses the view that victory in the battle saved the Irish Protestant community from massacre by the Irish Catholics – &quot;So praise God, all true Protestants, and I will say no further,
But had the Papists gained that day, there would have been open murder&quot;. Folk memories in the 17th century, when the song was possibly written, were no doubt still very fresh concerning the various retributive massacres between Irish natives and Protestant settlers in the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

==Literary references==
At the climactic scene of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, when protagonists are preparing for a dangerous fateful encounter with their enemies, the character MacPhee, an Ulster Protestant, is shown humming &quot;The Boyne Water&quot;. Lewis gives a slightly deviant text: &quot;King William said, be not dismayed, for the loss of one commander&quot;.

In Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Gerald O&#x27;Hara is described as having killed a man for whistling &quot;The Boyne Water&quot;. He had to flee Ireland to avoid prosecution for murder, and emigrated to Georgia, where in time he became a successful planter and the master of Tara.

In the Irish folksong &quot;The Old Orange Flute&quot; &quot;Boyne Water&quot; is one of the few tunes a stubbornly Protestant flute will play.

==Other songs to same tune==
The Jacobite song &quot;Lady Keith&#x27;s Lament&quot; is sung to the same tune. &quot;Rosc Catha na Mumhan&quot; (&quot;The Battle Cry of Munster&quot;), an Irish language song that gives the perspective of Irish Catholics warring with the settlers, uses the same tune and is attributed to (1709–92). &quot;Rosc Catha na Mumhan&quot; is the song that &quot;Come Out, Ye Black and Tans&quot;, a much later Irish republican song, based its tune off of.

Many American versions of the traditional folk song &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; use a tune related to &quot;The Boyne Water&quot;.

<doc id="315578" wikidata="Q750843" url="?curid=315578" title="Information processing (psychology)">
<text>In cognitive psychology, information processing is an approach to the goal of understanding human thinking that treats cognition as essentially computational in nature, with the mind being the &quot;software&quot; and the brain being the &quot;hardware&quot;. It arose in the 1940s and 1950s, after World War II. The information processing approach in psychology is closely allied to the computational theory of mind in philosophy; it is also related to cognitivism in psychology and functionalism in philosophy.

==Two types==
Information processing may be &quot;vertical&quot; or &quot;horizontal&quot;, either of which may be &quot;centralized&quot; or decentralized (&quot;distributed&quot;). The horizontally distributed processing approach of the mid-1980s became popular under the name connectionism. The connectionist network is made up of different nodes, and it works by a &quot;priming effect,&quot; and this happens when a &quot;prime node activates a connected node&quot;. But &quot;unlike in semantic networks, it is not a single node that has a specific meaning, but rather the knowledge is represented in a combination of differently activated nodes&quot;(Goldstein, as cited in Sternberg, 2012).

==Models and theories==
There are several proposed models or theories that describe the way in which we process information.
Every individual has different information overload point with the same information load because individuals have different information-processing capacities.

===Sternberg&#x27;s triarchic theory of intelligence===
Sternberg&#x27;s theory of intelligence is made up of three different components: creative, analytical, and practical abilities. Creativeness is the ability to have new original ideas, and being analytical can help a person decide whether the idea is a good one or not. &quot;Practical abilities are used to implement the ideas and persuade others of their value&quot;. In the middle of Sternberg&#x27;s theory is cognition and with that is information processing. In Sternberg&#x27;s theory, he says that information processing is made up of three different parts, meta components, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components. These processes move from higher-order executive functions to lower-order functions. Meta components are used for planning and evaluating problems, while performance components follow the orders of the meta components, and the knowledge-acquisition component learns how to solve the problems. This theory in action can be explained by working on an art project. First is a decision about what to draw, then a plan and a sketch. During this process there is simultaneous monitoring of the process, and whether it is producing the desired accomplishment. All these steps fall under the meta component processing, and the performance component is the art. The knowledge-acquisition portion is the learning or improving drawing skills. 

===Information processing model: the working memory===

Information processing has been described as &quot;the sciences concerned with gathering, manipulating, storing, retrieving, and classifying recorded information&quot;. According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model or multi-store model, for information to be firmly implanted in memory it must pass through three stages of mental processing: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.

An example of this is the working memory model. This includes the central executive, phonologic loop, episodic buffer, visuospatial sketchpad, verbal information, long-term memory, and visual information. The central executive is like the secretary of the brain. It decides what needs attention and how to respond. The central executive then leads to three different subsections. The first is phonological storage, subvocal rehearsal, and the phonological loop. These sections work together to understand words, put the information into memory, and then hold the memory. The result is verbal information storage. The next subsection is the visuospatial sketchpad which works to store visual images. The storage capacity is brief but leads to an understanding of visual stimuli. Finally, there is an episodic buffer. This section is capable of taking information and putting it into long-term memory. It is also able to take information from the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad, combining them with long-term memory to make &quot;a unitary episodic representation. 
In order for these to work, the sensory register takes in via the five senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. These are all present since birth and are able to handle simultaneous processing (e.g., food – taste it, smell it, see it). In general, learning benefits occur when there is a developed process of pattern recognition. The sensory register has a large capacity and its behavioral response is very short (1–3 seconds). 
Within this model, sensory store and short term memory or working memory has limited capacity. Sensory store is able to hold very limited amounts of information for very limited amounts of time. This phenomenon is very similar to having a picture taken with a flash. For a few brief moments after the flash goes off, the flash it seems to still be there. However, it is soon gone and there is no way to know it was there. Short term memory holds information for slightly longer periods of time, but still has a limited capacity. According to Linden, &quot;The capacity of STM had initially been estimated at &quot;seven plus or minus two&quot; items, which fits the observation from neuropsychological testing that the average digit span of healthy adults is about seven. However, it emerged that these numbers of items can only be retained if they are grouped into so-called chunks, using perceptual or conceptual associations between individual stimuli.&quot; Its duration is of 5–20 seconds before it is out of the subject&#x27;s mind. This occurs often with names of people newly introduced to. Images or information based on meaning are stored here as well, but it decays without rehearsal or repetition of such information. 
On the other hand, long-term memory has a potentially unlimited capacity and its duration is as good as indefinite. Although sometimes it is difficult to access, it encompasses everything learned until this point in time. One might become forgetful or feel as if the information is on the tip of the tongue. 

===Cognitive development theory===
Another approach to viewing the ways in which information is processed in humans was suggested by Jean Piaget in what is called the &quot;Piaget&#x27;s Cognitive Development Theory&quot;. Piaget developed his model based on development and growth. He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process. The four stages are: the sensorimotor (from birth to 2 years), preoperational (2–6 years), concrete operational (6–11 years), and formal operational periods (11 years and older). During the sensorimotor stage, newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes. In the preoperational stage, children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people&#x27;s point of view. The concrete operational stage is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem. The last stage is the formal operational, in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments. 

Furthermore, adolescence is characterized by a series of changes in the biological, cognitive, and social realms. In the cognitive area, the brain&#x27;s prefrontal cortex as well as the limbic system undergoes important changes. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is active when engaged in complicated cognitive activities such as planning, generating goals and strategies, intuitive decision-making, and metacognition (thinking about thinking). This is consistent with Piaget&#x27;s last stage of formal operations. The prefrontal cortex becomes complete between adolescence and early adulthood. The limbic system is the part of the brain that modulates reward sensitivity based on changes in the levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine) and emotions. 

In short, cognitive abilities vary according to our development and stages in life. It is at the adult stage that we are better able to be better planners, process and comprehend abstract concepts, and evaluate risks and benefits more aptly than an adolescent or child would be able to. 

In computing, &quot;information processing&quot; broadly refers to the use of algorithms to transform data—the defining activity of computers; indeed, a broad computing professional organization is known as the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP). It is essentially synonymous with the terms data processing or computation, although with a more general connotation.

<doc id="315581" wikidata="Q3521188" url="?curid=315581" title="The Halo Benders">
<text>The Halo Benders was a band formed in 1994 as a side project by Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening and Doug Martsch of Built to Spill. They released their first album, &quot;God Don&#x27;t Make No Junk&quot;, in 1994. They followed up in 1996 with &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Now&quot; and in 1998 with &quot;The Rebels Not In&quot;.

Following a hiatus through the early 2000s, the Halo Benders reformed in March 2007 for a pair of shows at the Visual Arts Collective in Boise, Idaho. The band featured Doug Martsch, Ralf Youtz, Calvin Johnson, Brett Netson, and Stephen Gere. November 2010, a reformed version with Doug, Calvin, Ralf Youtz and Wayne Flower appeared for a benefit for Friends of Mia, a child who had started an organization to help children with cancer and their families before herself passing away of cancer, at the Capitol Theater in Olympia, WA.

All three of the band&#x27;s albums were released on Johnson&#x27;s Olympia record label, K Records.

==Music==
The Halo Benders&#x27; music is characterized by untraditional sounds, movements, and song structures. The vocals of the baritone Johnson and the higher-pitched Martsch have been described as highly contrasting - &quot;each seems to inhabit a completely different song.&quot; Johnson has said that the two write lyrics for songs largely independently.

==Featured on &quot;Real Stories of the Highway Patrol&quot;==
While the band was touring Utah in the 90&#x27;s, they were pulled over by police officers filming for the reality series Real Stories of the Highway Patrol.

==Members==
*Doug Martsch - guitar, vocals, bass, keyboards, percussion
*Ralf Youtz - drums, guitar

<text>Uncasville is a village in the town of Montville, Connecticut, United States. It is located in southeastern Montville, at the mouth of the Oxoboxo River where it flows into the Thames River. The name is now applied more generally to all of the east end of Montville, which is the area served by the Uncasville ZIP Code (06382).

In 1994, the federal government officially recognized the Mohegan Indian Tribe of Connecticut, which had historically occupied this area as part of its traditional territory. That year Congress passed the &quot;Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act.&quot; It authorized the United States to take land into trust in northeastern Montville for the Mohegan tribe&#x27;s use as a reservation. Since gaining a reservation, in 1996 the tribe developed the Mohegan Sun casino resort. It has also built the Mohegan Sun Arena on their land. The Mohegan are one of the Native American peoples who speak Algonquian languages.

==History==

Uncasville was named by English colonists for Uncas, the 17th-century Mohegan sachem who became their ally. The Mohegan, originally part of the Algonquian-speaking Pequot people, became independent through the 17th and 18th centuries. They allied with English colonists during the Pequot War of 1637. Uncas established a fortified village for defense, now known as Fort Shantok, on an elevated site next to the Thames River. He later welcomed English colonists to the Mohegan lands.

The European-American brothers John and Arthur Schofield established the first woolen mill in the United States in Uncasville. Their carding and spinning mill, dependent on water power, was located at the mouth of the Oxoboxo River. The Uncasville Manufacturing Corporation operated on the river into the early 20th century, as shown in the postcard image to the right.

In the 1950s, the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation established a large manufacturing facility in the Sandy Desert section in northeastern Montville. In 1961, it formed a joint venture, the United Nuclear Corporation, with Mallinckrodt Corporation of America, and Nuclear Development Corporation of America. They started with a total of 1400 employees, producing nuclear reactor fuel components for the United States Navy nuclear program. The site was near Trading Cove. Some parts of the program ended by 1976. After United Nuclear ceased its operations about 1990, the site was cleaned up of environmental hazards, decommissioned, and released for unrestricted use. The village designated this as a redevelopment area as designated by the village.

During the colonial period, agents had sold traditional lands originally occupied by the Mohegan people and reserved for them by the colony; they became landless. European Americans assumed they would assimilate to the more numerous majority. In the 20th century the Mohegan reorganized and sought federal recognition through the formal administrative process, submitting thorough documentation to prove their community and cultural continuity despite the lack of land. At the same time, beginning in the 1970s, they pursued a land claim against Connecticut for having been deprived illegally of their traditional lands.

In 1994, the U.S. Department of the Interior granted federal recognition to the Mohegan tribe. Several months later, the U.S. Congress passed the &quot;Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act.&quot; It authorized the United States to take into trust the United Nuclear site for use as Mohegan reservation lands; with this, the law extinguished any other Mohegan land claims in Connecticut. In exchange, Congress approved the tribe undertaking gambling operations at the reservation site.

With its own reservation, the Mohegan developed gaming operations to generate revenue for tribal welfare. They opened the Mohegan Sun casino on October 12, 1996, near the former Fort Shantok site above the Thames River. It has since been expanded into a large resort with hotels and other facilities.

==Geography==
Uncasville village is located in southeastern Montville near the confluence of the Oxoboxo and Thames rivers. All of eastern Montville, located on the western shore of the Thames, is served by the Uncasville ZIP code, 06382, and is also known as Uncasville. The U.S. Census Bureau treats Uncasville village as part of the Oxoboxo River census-designated place. The Mohegan Sun resort is about north of Uncasville village.

==Mohegan Sun==

The Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, established in 1996, has become one of the largest casinos in the world. It has more than . The associated resort complex includes a luxury hotel, entertainment theater, and around 50 restaurants and 35 stores.

The Mohegan Sun Arena, located in the complex, hosts concerts and live sporting events. It can hold 10,000 people. It is the home court of the Connecticut Sun, a team of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association.

<doc id="315590" wikidata="Q617752" url="?curid=315590" title="Irem">
<text>is a Japanese video game developer and publisher, and manufacturer of pachinkos. The company has its headquarters in Chiyoda, Tokyo.

The full name of the company that uses the brand is Irem Software Engineering. It was established in 1997 by its parent company Nanao (now Eizo) for the purpose of taking over the development department of the original Irem Corporation, that had left the video game industry in 1994 to concentrate itself on the rental and sales of coin-op electronics. Irem Corporation was founded in 1974 as IPM and still exists today under the name of Apies.

Irem is known internationally for three 1980s arcade games: &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; (1982; licensed to Williams Electronics in North America), the earliest beat &#x27;em up, &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984), and the scrolling shooter &quot;R-Type&quot; (1987). Irem has been popular in Japan with games like &quot;&quot; for the PC Engine and &quot;In the Hunt&quot; and &quot;Undercover Cops&quot; for arcades.

Since the 2010s, Irem has largely abandoned the development of console video games in favor of games based on pachinko machines.

==History==

Irem&#x27;s ancestor was founded in 1969 by Kenzo Tsujimoto in Osaka Prefecture. Tsujimoto opened his store in Osaka to sell machines for cotton candy stores. At the time, Tsujimoto was already confident in the potential of the game entertainment and started including the manufacturing of pachinko machines to his business as early as 1970.

The success of the store led to the creation in 1974 of IPM Co Ltd, with Tsujimoto as its president. &quot;IPM&quot; stood for International Playing Machine. At first, IPM&#x27;s purpose was to build and install video game machines for small stores in Japan, and its initial vocation was not much different from Tsujimoto&#x27;s previous venture.

With &quot;Breakout&quot; and its various clones dominating the video game scene, IPM started to manufacture, sell, and rent arcade hardware cabinets. In 1977, IPM partnered with Nanao Corporation of Ishikawa Prefecture to produce CRT monitors for its arcade cabinets.

IPM released its first video arcade games in 1978, starting with &quot;IPM Invader&quot; (a clone of Taito&#x27;s legendary &quot;Space Invaders&quot;). In early 1979, IPM changed its name to Irem Corporation following a letter from IBM that the name &quot;IPM&quot; was too confusing. Irem is an acronym for &quot;International Rental Electronics Machines&quot;.

In 1980, Nanao became the majority shareholder of Irem Corporation.

Tsujimoto remained chairman of Irem Corporation in the early 1980s despite establishing in 1979 another company, I.R.M Corporation (the precursor of Capcom). However, Tsujimoto was blamed in 1982 for the declining sales of the video game &quot;IPM Invader&quot; and other lackluster titles, and was replaced by Nanao&#x27;s president. The following year, Tsujimoto left the company to form Capcom.

Three arcade games released by Irem in the 1980s became the company&#x27;s most successful titles: &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; (1982; licensed to Williams Electronics in North America), the earliest beat &#x27;em up, &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984), and the scrolling shooter &quot;R-Type&quot; (1987). While Irem&#x27;s arcade video games in the 1980s were typically developed in-house, its published titles on the Famicom home console were often handled by Tamtex, a Tokyo-based sister company from the Nanao Group.

In 1994, Irem completely ceased development of video games. The development department of Irem Corporation was transferred to Nanao&#x27;s headquarters in Ishikawa Prefecture. The company&#x27;s original wholesale division, in charge of manufacturing and renting/selling arcade cabinets, stayed in Osaka and was not impacted by the company&#x27;s restructuring. Then, a group of employees from Irem&#x27;s video game division, left to form their own company under the name Nazca Corporation, which became best known for developing SNK&#x27;s &quot;Metal Slug&quot; franchise.

In late 1996, Irem released the video game &quot;Gussun Paradise&quot; (ぐっすんぱらだいす) for the PlayStation. Although this was the company&#x27;s first video game in two years, this would also be the last video game from Irem Corporation.

On April 15, 1997, Nanao established Irem Software Engineering Inc. Shortly after in July 1997, Irem Software Engineering took over the development department of Irem Corporation and absorbed it.

With the video game business gone to the new Irem Software Engineering, Irem Corporation was left with only its longtime arcade equipment division. In 1997, Nanao sold Irem Corporation to Yubis Corporation. In 1998, Irem Corporation was renamed Apies Corporation Ltd to avoid confusing the company with Irem Software Engineering. Ownership of Apies changed hands in April 1999, when Yubis sold the company to Atlus. Atlus finally sold its shares of Apies in 2001 for 1 000 yen. Apies has been an independent company since then. With the decline of amusement equipment, Apies leading products are fortune-telling machines and senjafuda vending machines. In 2018, it was the top manufacturer of fortune-telling vending machines in Japan, controlling approximately 80% of the domestic market. Apies is now located in Wakō and is the original company founded in 1974 by Kenzo Tsujimoto. 

Following its inception in 1997, Irem Software Engineering developed and published, under the Irem trademark, video games in Japan mainly for the various PlayStation and Nintendo platforms. Irem Software Engineering owns the rights to the video games that were produced by Irem Corporation and continued releasing new installments of the &quot;R-Type&quot; franchise. As a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Irem canceled the majority of its remaining video game projects, including &quot;Disaster Report 4 Plus: Summer Memories&quot; (its production resumed in 2014 under another publisher) and a sequel to &quot;Steambot Chronicles&quot;. Irem refocused to become primarily a slot-machine and pachinko developer, the industry it was in before turning to video games. Many Irem designers, including producer Kazuma Kujo, gathered to form a new company called Granzella to continue creating video games. Though no longer involved in the development or release of new video games, Irem remains present in the industry as a licensor of its IPs to other companies. The company had long been based in Hakusan but moved in 2010 to Chiyoda, Tokyo. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eizo Corporation (formerly Nanao).

<doc id="315598" wikidata="Q169560" url="?curid=315598" title="Caravel">
<text>The caravel (Portuguese: , ) is a small sailing ship that may be rigged with just lateen sails, or with a combination of lateen and square sails. It was known for its agility and speed and its capacity for sailing windward (beating). Caravels were used by the Portuguese and Spanish for the voyages of exploration during the 15th and 16th centuries, in the Age of Discovery.

The caravel is a poorly understood type of vessel. Though there are now some archaeologically investigated wrecks that are most likely caravels, information on this type is limited. We have a better understanding of the ships of the Greeks and Romans of classical antiquity than we do of the caravel.
== History ==
The long development of the caravel was probably influenced by various Mediterranean tending or coastal craft. Among these influences might have been the boats known as , that were introduced to the Islamic controlled parts of Iberia Al-Andalus from the Maghreb.

The earliest caravels appeared in the thirteenth century along the coasts of Galicia and Portugal as single-masted fishing vessels. They were small, lightly built vessels of up to 20 tons at most, carrying, in one example, a crew of five men. Evidence suggests that these were . They carried a single-masted, triangular lateen sail rig. By the fourteenth century, their size had increased and their use had spread; for instance, there is mention, in 1307, of larger caravels of up to 30 tons in Biscay. Caravels were a common type of vessel in the coastal waters of the Iberian Peninsula in the fifteenth century.

The caravel was the preferred vessel of Portuguese explorers like Diogo Cão, Bartolomeu Dias, Gaspar, and Miguel Corte-Real, and was also used by Spanish expeditions like those of Christopher Columbus. They were agile and easier to navigate than the barca and barinel, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts. Being smaller and having a shallow keel, the caravel was suited for sailing shallow coastal waters and up rivers. With the Mediterranean-type lateen sails attached it was highly maneuverable in shallow waters, while with the square Atlantic-type sails attached it was very fast when crossing the open sea. Its economy, speed, and agility made it esteemed as the best sailing vessel of its time. Its main drawback was its limited capacity for cargo and crew but this did not hinder its success.

The exploration done with caravels made the spice trade of the Portuguese and the Spanish possible. However, for the trade itself, the caravel was soon replaced by the larger carrack (&quot;nau&quot;), which could carry larger, more profitable cargoes. The caravel was one of the pinnacle ships in Iberian ship development from 1400 to 1600.

The English name &quot;caravel&quot; derives from the Portuguese , which in turn may derive from the or the perhaps indicating some continuity of its carvel build through the ages.


== Design ==
The earliest caravels in the thirteenth century were small and are believed to have been un-decked, carrying one mast with lateen sails, while later types were larger and had two or three masts and decks. Caravels such as the &quot;caravela tilhlda&quot; of the 15th century had an average length of between , an average capacity of 50 to 60 tons, a high length-to-beam ratio of around 3.5 to 1, and narrow ellipsoidal frame (unlike the circular frame of the &quot;nau&quot;), making them very fast and maneuverable but with a limited cargo capacity. It was in such ships that Christopher Columbus set out on his expedition in 1492, while the &quot;Santa María&quot; was a small carrack of about 150 tons and served as the flagship, the &quot;Pinta&quot; and &#x27; were caravels of around 15–20 m with a beam of 6 m and a displacement of around 60–75 tons. The &quot;Niña&quot; was re-rigged by Columbus with square rig to give better performance on the Atlantic crossingmost of which was following favourable winds, for which lateen was less suitable.

===Square-rigged caravel===
Towards the end of the 15th century, the Portuguese developed a larger version of the caravel, bearing a forecastle and sterncastle – though not as high as those of a carrack, which would have made it unweatherly – but most distinguishable for its square-rigged foremast, and three other masts bearing lateen rig. In this form it was referred to in Portuguese as a &quot;round caravel&quot; () as in Iberian tradition, a bulging square sail is said to be round.

It was employed in coast-guard fleets near the Strait of Gibraltar and as an armed escort for merchant ships between Portugal and Brazil and in the Cape Route. Some consider this a forerunner of the fighting galleon and it remained in use until the 17th century.

<text>Chris &quot;Buddha&quot; Michalek (July 23, 1971 – December 16, 2010) was an American harmonica player.

Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he was an accomplished modern diatonic harmonica player in many styles including Jazz, Funk, Blues and World Music. Michalek was also the organizer of the Global Harmonica Summit in 2000. Michalek was known for using the overblow technique, which is used to play chromatically on the diatonic harmonica.

When he was a teenager, Michalek&#x27;s harmonicostic talents were discovered by members of the Twin Cities Harmonica Society, including the prominent harmonica player and one-time Harmonicat Dick Gardner.

It was the music of Howard Levy that opened Chris&#x27; eyes to the possibilities of the harmonica. Levy&#x27;s overblow, a kind of controlled upward bend, makes available all notes on the diatonic harmonica. The overblow allowed a combination of the excellent tone of the diatonic harmonica with the melodic possibilities of the chromatic. An instrument that once seemed limited became somewhat flexible.

Chris quickly began to play jazz and experiment with other styles of music. He was still playing up until recently with well-known bassist Mahlon Hawk in the Buddha&#x27;s Groove. He died of a stroke on December 16, 2010.

<text>The Monastery of Yuste is a monastery in the small village now called Cuacos de Yuste (in older works &quot;San Yuste&quot; or &quot;San Just&quot;) in the province of Cáceres in the autonomous community of Extremadura, Spain. The monastery was founded by the Hieronymite order of monks in 1402.

It is the monastery and palace house in which Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain resided from after his abdication until his death.

==History==
In 1556 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, retired to the Monastery of Yuste, near Cuacos de Yuste, after having abdicated the Spanish crown in favour of his son Philip II of Spain and the crown of the Holy Roman Empire in favour of his brother Ferdinand I. He intended to devote the rest of his life to prayer in this remote and obscure monastery. Nonetheless, the monastery had to be expanded that year to make room for the emperor and the 50 or 60 members of his entourage.

From time to time well-known people, including his illegitimate son Don Juan de Austria and his heir Philip II of Spain, came to visit the retired emperor. A fictitious visit by Carlos, Prince of Asturias, and other characters provides the moonlit setting for Act V of the original version of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, and Yuste is also the setting for both scenes of Act II of that long and celebrated opera. Charles died there on September 21, 1558. He was buried in the monastery church, though his remains were later transferred to the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial.

In 1809, during the Peninsular War, the monastery was burnt to the ground by the French army. It was left in ruins until 1949, when the Spanish government restored it at the behest of Francisco Franco.

The area around Yuste, the Valle del Jerte, is now an eco-tourist destination. Tourists can visit the monastery, including the emperor&#x27;s apartments. The valley is also known for its cherry trees and the beauty of the surrounding landscape.

The monastery is currently inhabited by monks of the Pauline Order. In 2007 the monastery was awarded with the European Heritage Label.

<doc id="315612" wikidata="Q16884649" url="?curid=315612" title="Thor in comics">
<text>Thor, the god of Norse mythology, has appeared as a character in various comics over the years, appearing in series from a range of publishers.

==Marvel Comics==
Thor Odinson (often called The Mighty Thor) is a Marvel Comics superhero, based on the thunder god of Norse mythology. The superhero was created by editor Stan Lee and penciller Jack Kirby, who co-plotted, and scripter Larry Lieber, and first appeared in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #83 (Aug. 1962). 

On a mission from his father, Odin, Thor acts as a superhero while maintaining the secret identity of Dr. Donald Blake, an American physician with a partially disabled leg. Blake can transform by tapping his walking stick on the ground; the cane becomes the magical hammer Mjolnir and Blake transforms into Thor.

Thor, a founding member of the superhero group the Avengers, often battles his evil adoptive brother Loki, a Marvel character adapted from the Norse god of mischief. He is among Marvel&#x27;s most powerful superheroes. Many recurring characters in his stories are based on Norse Mythology. As with other superheroes, the Thor identity has been taken by other characters, including Jane Foster, who became a female Thor.

Apart from this main superhero, Marvel features a number of characters based on him.

Chris Hemsworth portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, first appearing in the 2011 film &quot;Thor&quot;. Hemsworth reprised his role for &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;,&quot; &quot; and &quot;.

==DC Comics==

Jack Kirby made a story featuring Thor in &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; #16. A cowboy finds Thor&#x27;s hammer in the American desert and uses it for his own gain, until it is reclaimed by Thor. This version of Thor is not similar to the Marvel Comics character that Kirby would create five years later, although there are some minor similarities, such as the design of Mjolnir and the circles in Thor&#x27;s chest. Kirby would often cite this adventure to claim that he was the main creator of the Marvel Comics character.

Thor appears in the first issues of Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World by John Byrne. His appearance is explicitly based on Kirby&#x27;s design of the Marvel character, but is more faithful to the original mythology having red hair, a beard and a more brutish personality. He and the other Asgard gods are stated to be related to, but not synonymous with, the Old Gods (the progenitors of the New Gods). Later Thor clarifies that they are &quot;echoes&quot; of the Old Gods and resemble them down to their names, thus explaining how the Norse gods can still exist in the DC Universe when the event that killed the Old Gods is implied to have been Ragnarök.

Thor also appears briefly in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; series in the story &quot;Seasons of Mists&quot;. In that story, he, Odin and Loki try (and fail) to get the key of Hell. Thor is portrayed as a lewd drunk. This is in contrast to the Marvel Comics portrayal of Thor, where Thor is portrayed as very noble and earnest. In the later &quot;Sandman&quot; story, &quot;Kindly Ones&quot;, he helps Odin capture Loki.

In another story, Wonder Woman and Superman travel to Valhalla and help Thor in a war for a thousand years.

==America&#x27;s Best Comics (ABC)==
The deity Thor (called &quot;Þunor&quot; or &quot;Thunor&quot; as in Thor&#x27;s Old English name) appears in the America&#x27;s Best Comics police procedural series &quot;Top 10&quot; by artist Gene Ha and writer Alan Moore, where officers interview the deity and other gods as witnesses to the death of Baldur at the hands of Hod. The god appears here as a belligerent, red-bearded, balding man, prone to swearing, whose lack of cooperation leads to a swift takedown by Smax.

==Comico Comics==
Thor is also a fictional character in the comic book series &quot;Elementals&quot;. He was created by Bill Willingham and first appeared in &quot;Elementals&quot; #23 (Volume 1).

==Willy Vandersteen group (Flemish)==
The Flemish comic artist Willy Vandersteen started three series in which a Thor was featured. His very first published newspaper comic series (when World War II stopped US-import in 1941) was &quot;Tor de Holbewoner&quot;, about a caveman called Tor. Taking into account that &quot;Tor&quot; is a Dutch word for beetle, in Dutch the difference between T and Th is hardly (if at all) heard and that it was about a caveman living way before the invention of orthography, it is no miracle that this caveman returned (still during the war) with his name changed to &quot;Thor&quot;.

In &quot;De Rode Ridder&quot; series the existence of the thunder god Thor is shown in #45, (The Hammer of Thor, 1970) and the Thunderer has a role in #63 (The Valkyrie, 1974), in which the Rode/Red Knight has been chosen by Odin to complete a mission the gods cannot do themselves without causing Ragnarok. Both albums are by Karel Biddeloo. Unlike the Marvel Thor, Biddeloo&#x27;s Thor is more or less a country boy, with enormous powers but bound by responsibility (avoidance of Ragnarok). The hammer of Thor was a weapon mortals could and did carry and use, but it was too powerful to control.

In the most popular series started by Vandersteen, Suske en Wiske (Spike and Suzy), Thor is featured once in #158 in a story by Paul Geerts. Thor in this version is a cruel, grey-bearded god, going a bit bald on top, thundering and lightninging with his hammer, without throwing it. (Odin in this story is the young-looking, bearded redhead). Like Biddeloo&#x27;s Thor, this one is also dressed in animal skins, and that may be seen as a reference to the caveman.

==Madsen’s Valhalla Thor (Danish)==
This is Thor in the European &quot;comedic adventure&quot; tradition of Asterix, Lucky Luke etc. with the difference that where those series are using history as source material, Peter Madsen uses mythology for his series Valhalla (1978), with the same freedom to make jokes about current reality or other works of fiction, mostly following the Eddas.

Thor is one of the main heroes of the series and can be seen as a central character.

Thor is here rather correctly put, as the honest, red bearded muscular, powerful god, with a bit of extra human weaknesses to keep the comic funny. Statements that he would be fat are false, but may be based on his disguise in #3 as Volstagg, thus parodying Marvel&#x27;s Asgardians.

Thrud and Modi are his firstborn children (in #2), their mother is Sif (pregnant from the start of the series). Magni has Jarnsaxa as mother and shows up in #9.

==Other uses of Thor in comics==

===Other uses of the Norse myth in comics===

Other uses of the Thor of Norse mythology include:
* Thor is a semi-regular character in the Karl Vincent: Vampire Hunter series from KRG comics
*Thor and Dynamite Thor: The Golden Age anthology &quot;Weird Comics&quot; by the Fox Feature Syndicate featured two characters named Thor. The first, seen in issues #1-5, is a mortal man given strange lightning powers by the Norse God. Grant Ferrell was chosen by the real Thor, looking down at humanity from his perch in Valhalla. Thor decided to bestow powers on a mortal, and spied Grant, a meek man who lost his girlfriend Glenda at a nightclub. Thor picked Grant up and brought him to Valhalla, where he was trained in using the powers of lightning and Mjolnir, Thor&#x27;s magic hammer. Grant returns to Earth dressed in a revealing costume — just trunks, a cape and a helmet. He rescues Glenda from a group of spies, and decides to devote his life to heroic deeds. He goes on to fight spies and Germans. That character lasted for five issues, and was then rebooted in issue #6 as a new character, Peter &quot;Dynamite&quot; Thor, with different powers, but the same girlfriend. Dynamite Thor was a demolitions expert who was immune to the effect of explosives. He used dynamite to propel himself through the air. He used his abilities to fight spies, mad scientists and the devious War Maniac. Dynamite Thor appeared in &quot;Weird Comics&quot; #6 and 7, and then moved to &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; #6-8.
*Thor, along with the other Norse gods, appears in David Brin&#x27;s comic, &quot;The Life Eaters&quot;.
*&quot;Thôrr-Sverd: The Sword of Thor&quot; #1-3, published ca. 1987 by Vincent Creations, began the telling of the story of the impact of the gods on the Proto-Indo-European people. It suggested that perhaps, contrary to canonical mythology, the giants were the good guys and the gods were the villains.
*Erik Larsen&#x27;s Savage Dragon has its own version of Thor, a red-headed villainous thunder god.

<text>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) or brown fat makes up the adipose organ together with white adipose tissue (or white fat). Brown adipose tissue is found in almost all mammals.

Classification of brown fat refers to two distinct cell populations with similar functions. The first shares a common embryological origin with muscle cells, found in larger &quot;classic&quot; deposits. The second develops from white adipocytes that are stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system. These adipocytes are found interspersed in white adipose tissue and are also named &#x27;beige&#x27; or &#x27;brite&#x27; (for &quot;brown in white&quot;).

Brown adipose tissue is especially abundant in newborns and in hibernating mammals. It is also present and metabolically active in adult humans, but its prevalence decreases as humans age. Its primary function is thermoregulation. In addition to heat produced by shivering muscle, brown adipose tissue produces heat by non-shivering thermogenesis. The therapeutic targeting of brown fat for the treatment of human obesity is an active research field.

In contrast to white adipocytes, which contain a single lipid droplet, brown adipocytes contain numerous smaller droplets and a much higher number of (iron-containing) mitochondria, which gives the tissue its color. Brown fat also contains more capillaries than white fat. These supply the tissue with oxygen and nutrients and distribute the produced heat throughout the body.

==Location and classification==
BAT&#x27;s presence in adult humans was discovered in 2003 during FDG-PET scans to detect metastatic cancers. Using these scans and data from human autopsies, several deposits have been identified. In infants, brown adipose tissue deposits include: interscapular, supraclavicular, suprarenal, pericardial, para-aortic and around the pancreas, kidney and trachea. These deposits gradually get more white fat-like during adulthood. In adults, the deposits that are most often detected in FDG-PET scans are the supraclavicular, paravertebral, mediastinal, para-aortic and suprarenal ones. It remains to be determined whether these deposits are &#x27;classical&#x27; brown adipose tissue or beige/brite fat.

Brown fat in humans in the scientific and popular literature refers to two cell populations defined by both anatomical location and cellular morphology. Both share the presence of small lipid droplets and numerous iron-rich mitochondria, giving the brown appearance.
* &quot;Classical&quot; brown fat is found in highly vascularized deposits in somewhat consistent anatomical locations, such as between the shoulder blades, surrounding the kidneys, the neck, and supraclavicular area, and along the spinal cord. This is the smaller of the two types and has numerous small lipid droplets.
* Beige fat is the adrenergically inducible cell type that is dispersed throughout adipose tissue. It has greater variability in lipid droplet size and a greater proportion of mitochondria to lipid droplets than white fat, giving it a light brown appearance. In mouse and human organoid models, EPAC1 (exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP) was reported to preferentially increase the production of beige fat relative to WAT.

==Development==
Brown fat cells come from the middle embryo layer, mesoderm, also the source of myocytes (muscle cells), adipocytes, and chondrocytes (cartilage cells).

The classic population of brown fat cells and muscle cells both seem to be derived from the same population of stem cells in the mesoderm, paraxial mesoderm. Both have the intrinsic capacity to activate the myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) promoter, a trait only associated with myocytes and this population of brown fat. Progenitors of traditional white fat cells and adrenergically induced brown fat do not have the capacity to activate the Myf5 promoter. Both adipocytes and brown adipocyte may be derived from pericytes, the cells which surround the blood vessels that run through white fat tissue. Notably, this is not the same as the presence of Myf5 protein, which is involved in the development of many tissues.

Additionally, muscle cells that were cultured with the transcription factor PRDM16 were converted into brown fat cells, and brown fat cells without PRDM16 were converted into muscle cells.

==Function==
The mitochondria in a eukaryotic cell utilize fuels to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process involves storing energy as a proton gradient, also known as the proton motive force (PMF) generated by moving protons from the mitochondrial matrix (N or negative side) across the mitochondrial inner membrane to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (P or positive side) using the energy released by the electron transport chain. This proton gradient energy is used to synthesize ATP when the protons flow across the membrane (down their concentration gradient - from a region of high proton concentration to a region of lower proton concentration) through the ATP synthase complex; this is known as chemiosmosis.

In endotherms, body heat is maintained by signaling the mitochondria to allow protons to move back into the mitochondrial matrix (down their concentration gradient - from a region of high proton concentration to a region of lower proton concentration) without producing ATP (proton leak). This can occur since an alternative return route for the protons exists through an uncoupling protein in the inner membrane. This protein, known as uncoupling protein 1 (thermogenin) - which is unique to brown adipose tissue, facilitates the return of the protons after they have been actively pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix by the electron transport chain. This alternative route for protons uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and the energy in the PMF is instead released as heat.

To some degree, all cells of endotherms give off heat, especially when body temperature is below a regulatory threshold. However, brown adipose tissue is highly specialized for this non-shivering thermogenesis. First, each cell has a higher number of mitochondria compared to more typical cells. Second, these mitochondria have a higher-than-normal concentration of thermogenin in the inner membrane.

===Infants===
In neonates (newborn infants), brown fat makes up about 5% of the body mass and is located on the back, along the upper half of the spine and toward the shoulders. It is of great importance to avoid hypothermia, as lethal cold is a major death risk for premature neonates.
Numerous factors make infants more susceptible to cold than adults:
* A higher ratio of body surface area (proportional to heat loss) to body volume (proportional to heat production)
* A higher proportional surface area of the head
* A low amount of musculature and the inability to shiver
* A lack of thermal insulation, e.g., subcutaneous fat and fine body hair (especially in prematurely born children)
* An inability to move away from cold areas, air currents or heat-draining materials
* An inability to use additional ways of keeping warm (e.g., drying their skin, putting on clothing, moving into warmer areas, or performing physical exercise)
* A nervous system that is not fully developed and does not respond quickly and/or properly to cold (e.g., by contracting blood vessels in and just below the skin: vasoconstriction).

Heat production in brown fat provides an infant with an alternative means of heat regulation.

===Adults===
It was believed that after infants grow up, most of the mitochondria (which are responsible for the brown color) in brown adipose tissue disappear, and the tissue becomes similar in function and appearance to white fat. In rare cases, brown fat continues to grow, rather than involuting; this leads to a tumour known as a hibernoma. It is now known that brown fat is related not to white fat, but to skeletal muscle.

Studies using positron emission tomography scanning of adult humans have shown that brown adipose tissue is still present in most adults in the upper chest and neck (especially paravertebrally). The remaining deposits become more visible (increasing tracer uptake, meaning more metabolically active) with cold exposure, and less visible if an adrenergic beta blocker is given before the scan. These discoveries could lead to new methods of weight loss, since brown fat takes calories from normal fat and burns it. Scientists have been able to stimulate brown fat growth in mice. One study of APOE knock out mice showed cold exposure could promote atherosclerotic plaque growth and instability. The study mice were subjected to sustained low temperatures of 4 °C for 8 weeks which may have caused a stress condition, due to rapid forced change rather than a safe acclimatisation, that can be used to understand the effect on adult humans of modest reductions of ambient temperature of just 5 to 10 °C. Furthermore, several newer studies have documented the substantial benefits of cold exposure in multiple species including humans, for example researchers concluded that &quot;activation of brown adipose tissue is a powerful therapeutic avenue to ameliorate hyperlipidaemia and protect from atherosclerosis&quot; and that brown fat activation reduces plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels and attenuates diet-induced atherosclerosis development.

Long-term studies of adult humans are needed to establish a balance of benefit and risk, in combination with historical research of living conditions of recent human generations prior to the current increase of poor health related to excessive accumulation of white fat. Pharmacological approaches using β3-adrenoceptor agonists have been shown to enhance glucose metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue in rodents.

Additionally research has shown:
* Brown adipose tissue activation improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in humans suggesting that anyone with impaired insulin function might benefit from BAT activation; however, there is broader application given research showing even mildly elevated blood glucose in healthy non-diabetic humans is associated with damage over time of many organs such as eyes, tendons, endothelial/cardiovascular system and brain, and results in higher levels of damaging advanced glycation end products.
* Brown adipose tissue activation may play an important role in bone health and bone density.
* Brown adipose tissue activation through cold exposure increases adiponectin levels, just two hours of cold exposure resulted in a 70% increase in circulating adiponectin in adult men. Centenarians (both men and women) and their offspring have been found to have genetics that boost adiponectin, and they have higher circulating adiponectin, suggesting a link between longevity and adiponectin production. In addition, high concentrations of plasma adiponectin in centenarians was associated with favorable metabolic indicators, and with lower levels of C-reactive protein and E-selectin.
* Cold exposure increases circulating irisin. Irisin improves insulin sensitivity, increases bone quality and quantity, is involved in the building of lean muscle mass, and helps reduce obesity by converting white fat to brown fat, providing many of the same benefits of exercise. Healthy centenarians are characterized by increased serum irisin levels, whereas levels of this hormone were found to be significantly lower in young patients with myocardial infarction. These findings may prompt further research into the role played by irisin not only in vascular disorders but also in life span modulation.
* Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Production (FGF-21) has been documented as a pathway to longevity. BAT activation through cold exposure up-regulates circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in humans by 37%. FGF21 improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism which may partially explain its longevity promoting benefits.
* Under basal environmental temperatures, HDAC3 primes expression of UCP1 and the brown fat thermogenic program to ensure acute cold survival through the deacetylation and activation of PGC-1alpha.
* Cold exposure increases SIRT1 phosphorylation/activity in both skeletal muscle and BAT, increasing thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity through deacetylation of PGC-1alpha and other protein targets. Elevated SIRT1 levels in people are associated with increased human longevity. SIRT1 (and the other sirtuins) have many metabolic effects, but an important one for improving health and longevity is the fact that SIRT1 increases insulin sensitivity and glucose control in skeletal muscles, triggers the browning of white fat and increases BAT activity.

==Other animals==
The interscapular brown adipose tissue is commonly and inappropriately referred to as the &quot;hibernating gland&quot;. Whilst believed by many to be a type of gland, it is actually a collection of adipose tissues lying between the scapulae of rodentine mammals. Composed of brown adipose tissue and divided into two lobes, it resembles a primitive gland, regulating the output of a variety of hormones. The function of the tissue appears to be involved in the storage of medium to small lipid chains for consumption during hibernation, the smaller lipid structure allowing for a more rapid path of energy production than glycolysis.

In studies where the interscapular brown adipose tissue of rats were lesioned, it was demonstrated that the rats had difficulty regulating their normal body-weight.

The longest-lived small mammals, bats (30 years) and naked mole rats (32 years), all have remarkably high levels of brown adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue activity. However, brown fat is unlikely to play a role in body temperature regulation of many large-bodied mammals as the UCP1 gene, encoding for the key thermogenic protein of the tissue, has been inactivated in several lineages (e.g. horses, elephants, sea cows, whales and hyraxes). A reduced surface area to volume ratio among large-bodied species decreases heat loss in the cold, diminishing thermogenic demands required to defend body temperatures. UCP1 loss in other species (e.g. pangolins, armadillos, sloths and anteaters) may be linked to selection pressures favouring low metabolic rates.

<text>Terrance James Reid (born 13 November 1949), nicknamed &quot;Superlungs&quot;, is an English rock vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist best known for his emotive style of singing in appearances with high-profile musicians as vocalist, supporting act and session musician. As a solo recording and touring artist, he has released seven studio albums and four live albums. His songs have been recorded by numerous artists including The Hollies, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Jackson Browne, Arrival, Marianne Faithfull, Cheap Trick, Jack White with The Raconteurs, Joe Perry, Rumer and Chris Cornell.

Reid’s music career began in the early 1960s performing in a local British club where he was invited to join Peter Jay and the Jaywalkers as lead vocalist, opening for The Rolling Stones 1966 tour. In the later &#x27;60s, Reid was the solo supporting act for the Rolling Stones, Cream, Jethro Tull and Fleetwood Mac tours. He is known to have turned down an offer by Jimmy Page to be the lead vocalist of the band that became Led Zeppelin as well as an offer from Ritchie Blackmore to front Deep Purple. 

==Early life and education==

Terrance James Reid was born in Paxton Park Maternity Home, Little Paxton, St Neots, Huntingdonshire, England. He lived in the village of Bluntisham and attended St Ivo School, St Ives.

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===
After leaving school at the age of fifteen, Reid joined Peter Jay and the Jaywalkers after being spotted by the band&#x27;s drummer, Peter Jay. At the time, Reid was playing for a local band, The Redbeats, who regularly performed at the River Club in St Ives. His public profile was enhanced in 1966 when The Jaywalkers were named as a supporting act for the Rolling Stones during their 23-show British Tour from September to October 1966. At the concert at the Royal Albert Hall, Graham Nash of The Hollies became friends with Reid and suggested The Jaywalkers sign up with UK Columbia Records—an EMI label—to record with producer John Burgess. Their first single, the soul-inspired &quot;The Hand Don&#x27;t Fit the Glove&quot; was a minor hit in 1967, but by then The Jaywalkers had decided to disband.

Reid came to the attention of producer Mickie Most, who became his manager and who was in partnership with Peter Grant at the time. His first single with Most, &quot;Better By Far&quot;, became a radio favorite. His debut album, &quot;Bang Bang, You&#x27;re Terry Reid&quot;, was released in 1968. With accompanying musicians Peter Solley on organ and Keith Webb on drums, a 1968 tour of the United States with Cream did much to gain Reid a loyal following. His final performance of the tour at the Miami Pop Festival garnered positive reviews from the music press.

The song &quot;Without Expression&quot;, from &quot;Bang Bang, You&#x27;re Terry Reid&quot;, written by Reid at age 14 and later recorded under different titles. The Hollies released it as &quot;A Man With No Expression&quot; in 1968, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded it as &quot;Horses Through a Rainstorm&quot; in 1969, and REO Speedwagon covered it in 1973 as &quot;Without Expression (Don&#x27;t Be the Man).&quot; John Mellencamp also included it on his greatest hits album &quot;The Best That I Could Do: 1978–1988, again with the parenthetical &quot;Don&#x27;t Be the Man&quot;, with Nash singing lead on the first two.&quot; &quot;Horses Through a Rainstorm&quot; was slated to appear on &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; before being replaced at the last minute by Stephen Stills&#x27;s &quot;Carry On&quot;. Both versions were not released until years later.

==== Rejecting Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple ====
Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page, managed by Peter Grant, became interested in Reid&#x27;s work, and when The Yardbirds disbanded, Page wanted Reid to fill the vocalist spot for his proposed new group, the New Yardbirds, which was to become Led Zeppelin. Reid had already committed to go on the road for two tours with the Rolling Stones and another with Cream (as an opening act on the 1968 US Tour). Reid suggested to Page that if he were compensated for the gig fees he would lose and if Page would call Keith Richards to explain why Reid had to pull out of the US tours, Reid would try some things out with Page. It never happened and Reid told Page to consider a young Birmingham-based singer, Robert Plant, instead, having previously seen Plant&#x27;s Band of Joy as a support act at one of his concerts. Reid also suggested Page check out their drummer John Bonham. Reid also rejected an offer from Ritchie Blackmore to replace the departing Rod Evans in Deep Purple.

=== 1969–1970s ===
In 1969, Reid supported British tours, notably Jethro Tull and Fleetwood Mac. Reid, Solley and Webb toured the United States again when he opened for the Rolling Stones on their 1969 American Tour. He did not appear at the infamous Rolling Stones concert at Altamont Music Festival.

In December 1969, Reid had a falling out with producer Mickie Most, who wanted Reid to become a balladeer and strictly follow Most&#x27;s own formula. Before this, Reid had toured extensively in major venues in the US, including two tours with the Rolling Stones and another with Cream (he also performed at Mick and Bianca Jagger&#x27;s wedding in Saint-Tropez in 1971). Unable to record or release his music, Reid concentrated on live work, mostly in the US whilst awaiting the outcome of litigation with Most, making only sporadic UK performances during that period. In 1970, he returned briefly to England to perform at the Isle of Wight Festival with bass player Lee Miles (a former member of Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s band whom Reid met while touring the US with the Stones), David Lindley and Tim Davis. During this period he also took part in the second Atlanta International Pop Festival, and was filmed performing at Glastonbury in 1971. 

Reid’s fascination with Brazilian music and Latin rhythms began in 1969 when Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso were exiled by the military dictatorship of Brazil and Reid’s attorney arranged for Gil’s arrival in London, where he stayed at Reid’s apartment in Notting Hill, Chelsea, London. Along with Gil, a group of Brazilian musicians slept on his floor. When Reid performed at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 27, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso played on the same bill that night.

That same year, Reid was signed by Ahmet Ertegun to Atlantic Records, with his band consisting of David Lindley, Lee Miles and Alan White; they began recording in the UK and later switched to the US. White left to join Yes and Lindley left to tour with Jackson Browne. However, Lee Miles remained and was Reid&#x27;s trusty sidekick for many years to come. Other musicians on the album, titled &quot;River&quot;, included Conrad Isidore on drums and Willie Bobo on percussion. Produced by Reid, engineered by Tom Dowd, and mixed by Eddy Offord this third album was released in 1973 and received favourable reviews, but failed commercially. The remainder of the material from those extensive sessions was released in 2016 as &quot;The Other Side of The River.&quot;

Over the next decade, Reid switched to different labels in search of a winning formula. &quot;Seed of Memory&quot; was released by ABC Records in 1976, and produced by Graham Nash (ABC filed for bankruptcy the week the album was released), and &quot;Rogue Waves&quot; was produced by Chris Kimsey for Capitol Records in 1979. For Rogue Waves, Reid enlisted Lee Miles on bass, Doug Rodrigues on lead guitar and John Siomos on drums, recording at Brother&#x27;s Studios in Santa Monica, California.

=== 1980s–1990s ===
Reid retired his solo career in 1981 to concentrate on session work, appearing on albums by Don Henley, Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt. In 1991, Reid returned with producer Trevor Horn for the WEA album &quot;The Driver&quot;. The album featured a cover version &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; which also appeared on the soundtrack for the Tom Cruise movie &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; by Tony Scott. In the 1990s, he also toured the US and Hong Kong with Mick Taylor. &quot;Rich Kid Blues&quot; was the eponymous song on an album released by Marianne Faithfull, produced by Mike Leander in 1984 but unreleased for 14 years. Reid and friends put together an informal group in March 1993, calling themselves The Flew. Members included Reid, Joe Walsh, Nicky Hopkins, Rick Rosas, and Phil Jones. They played one show at The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. This was Nicky Hopkins&#x27; last public performance before his death.

=== 2000s–present ===
In late 2002, Reid returned to the UK with longtime bass player Lee Miles for three shows at the [WOMAD] festival near Reading, his first live appearance in years. In 2005 he returned for a UK tour with London shows at The 100 Club and Ronnie Scott&#x27;s. One venue billed him as &#x27;The Man with a Hell of a Story To Tell&#x27;. This began a run of regular visits by Reid, who has toured the UK every year since. For appearances at festivals and his London shows, Reid uses a full band and venues have included The Jazz Cafe, The Borderline, The 100 Club, Dingwalls, The Half Moon and notably an invite to return to Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in 2009 for a week long residency as part of their 50th anniversary (one of only 6 non-jazz acts to do so). This became Reid&#x27;s favourite venue and he had residencies there for several years after. In 2012, his album &quot;Live in London&quot; featured an entire set from one of these gigs at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s, and was released with no remixes or overdubs. Reid&#x27;s UK band regularly attracts the best UK session players (Ash Soan - drums, BJ Cole - pedal steel, Dzal Martin -guitar, Mark Smith - bass, David Tench - piano). Between 2002 and 2012, Reid appeared at the Glastonbury Festival several times and many other festivals: The Isle of Wight, The Secret Garden (twice), The Rhythm Festival (twice), and All Tomorrows Parties. Also during this period, EMI produced the &quot;Superlungs&quot; box set of his first two albums and all his sessions for them recorded between 1966 and 1970. Also &quot;Seed of Memory&quot; and &quot;River&quot; became available on CD and a new live album, &quot;Alive&quot; was released by Sanctuary Records, having previously been available from Reid himself, who made 200 copies to sell at WOMAD 2002. Around this time Reid began a residency at The Joint in Los Angeles, this became &quot;Big Monday&#x27; and ran for four years, with many of his friends dropping by when they were in town including Robert Plant, Keith Richards, Bobby Womack, Roger Daltrey, and Eric Burdon.

His song &quot;Dean&quot; from the &quot;River&quot; album was used in the feature film &quot;The Criminal&quot; produced 1999 and released in 2001. Reid became good friends with the film&#x27;s producer Chris Johnson who also become Reid&#x27;s business advisor and persuaded Reid to return live work in the US in early 2000&#x27;s and arranging UK tours, recruiting players for his band, arranging collaborations with other artists, organising back catalogue releases, licensing his songs for films and even an acting role. In 2003 Johnson placed three of Reid&#x27;s songs, &quot;Seed of Memory&quot;, &quot;To Be Treated Rite&quot;, and &quot;Brave Awakening&quot; in the movie &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; directed by Rob Zombie. Also his song &quot;Faith To Arise&quot; was in the 2003 film &quot;Wonderland&quot; and in the 2017 film &quot;Win It All&quot;. In 2009, his song &#x27;Be Yourself&quot;, which he wrote for Graham Nash&#x27;s &quot;Songs For Beginners&quot;, appeared in the Jason Reitman film &quot;Up in the Air&quot; (2009). In the 2005 Bill Paxton movie &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;, Reid played a golf caddy.

In July/August 2007, Reid returned for another six-week UK tour being backed by The Cosmic American Derelicts, a band out of northern New Jersey and southern New York, and their guitar player Eddie Rainey became a member of Reid&#x27;s band for three or so years. On 26 June 2009, Reid appeared with Rainey at Great Yarmouth club, The Residence, where Reid was reunited with Peter Jay for the first time in over 15 years.

Reid is popular with newer artists as a collaborator; the pairing of Shine (a French trip-hop act) and Reid led to him spending a week in Paris to record several tracks as guest vocalist. They played a one-off at the Pigalle Club in London on 26 August 2009. &quot;Shine featuring Terry Reid&quot; was released as an EP in November 2009. Reid was in San Francisco lending his voice to the track &quot;Listen&quot; by DJ Shadow as one of a few bonus tracks added to his best of album. Another collaboration has yet to see the light of day: &quot;All God&#x27;s Children Need Dancing Shoes&quot; with Alabama 3 after they shared a stage at the Rhythm Festival.

== Recognition ==
Reid is acknowledged by Robert Plant as the outstanding voice of his generation and an influence on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s early material and is credited by Jimmy Page for connecting him to Robert Plant. 

Aretha Franklin once said of Reid:

Many songs originally recorded by Reid have been covered by numerous artists including The Hollies, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Arrival, Marianne Faithfull, Cheap Trick, Jack White with The Raconteurs, Joe Perry, Rumer and Chris Cornell:

Reid&#x27;s early song &quot;Rich Kid Blues&quot; was covered on an album by Marianne Faithfull in 1984. The UK artist Rumer recorded &quot;Brave Awakening&quot; on her &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; 2012 album and appeared at his London shows at the Jazz Cafe and Half Moon. Cheap Trick recorded Reid&#x27;s &quot;Speak Now&quot; for their 1977 debut album. The Raconteurs with Jack White also recorded a version of Reid&#x27;s &quot;Rich Kid Blues&quot; for their second album &quot;Consolers of the Lonely&quot; in 2008. 

The American rock group The Split Squad recorded a cover of Reid&#x27;s &quot;Tinker Taylor&quot; for their debut album, &quot;Now Hear This...&quot;, released in 2014. Joe Perry&#x27;s album &quot;Sweetzerland Manifesto&quot;, released in 2018, features three tracks co-written and sung by Reid. In 2020, a recording of Chris Cornell covering Reid&#x27;s &quot;To Be Treated Rite&quot; was released on his posthumous album &quot;No One Sings Like You Anymore, Vol. 1&quot;, which also included a cover of &quot;Stay with Me Baby&quot; based on Reid&#x27;s own version.

<text>P. J. Proby (born James Marcus Smith; November 6, 1938) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor.

Proby recorded the singles &quot;Hold Me&quot;, &quot;Somewhere&quot;, and &quot;Maria&quot;. In 2008, EMI released the greatest hits album &quot;Best of the EMI Years 1961–1972&quot;. He still writes and records on his own independent record label, Select Records, and performs in the UK in Sixties-themed concerts.

==Early life==
Proby was born James Marcus Smith on November 6, 1938 in Houston, Texas. He is a great-grandson of Old West outlaw John Wesley Hardin. His father was an affluent banker; at nine, his parents divorced and as part of the custody deal, Proby was sent to military school. He began at San Marcos Military Academy, and followed with stints in Culver Naval Academy and Western Military Academy.

==Career==
===1960s===
By the time Proby left school, he had already wanted a career &quot;in the movies&quot; and moved to California to become an actor and recording artist. Given the stage name Jett Powers by Hollywood agents Gabey, Lutz, Heller, and Loeb, he took acting and singing lessons and played small roles in films. Two singles, &quot;Go, Girl, Go&quot; and &quot;Loud Perfume&quot; appeared on two small independent record labels. In 1960, songwriter Sharon Sheeley persuaded him to adopt the stage name P. J. Proby, the name of a former boyfriend from high school, and secured Proby an audition for Dick Glasser of Liberty Records. It was a success, and Proby signed with the label and the music publisher Metric Music. After a number of unsuccessful singles, in 1962 Proby began writing songs and recording demos for artists such as Elvis Presley, Bobby Vee, and Johnny Burnette, who had his final UK chart success with the song &quot;Clown Shoes&quot;, credited to Proby&#x27;s real name.

Proby travelled to London after being introduced to Jack Good by Sheeley and Jackie DeShannon. He appeared on The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Around the Beatles&quot; television special in 1964. Under Good, Proby had UK top 10 hits in 1964 and 1965 including &quot;Hold Me&quot; (UK Number 3), &quot;Together&quot; (UK Number 8), &quot;Somewhere&quot; (UK Number 6), and &quot;Maria&quot; (UK Number 8); the last two songs were both lifted from the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;. He also recorded the Lennon–McCartney composition &quot;That Means a Lot&quot;, a song the Beatles recorded in 1965, but never officially released until 1996.

Proby is remembered for an incident in January 1965, when his trousers split across the knees during a show in Croydon, London. As a result, Proby was banned in every major theatre in Britain, plus appearing on the BBC and ITV television channels. The incident scandalised the British press and public, causing Proby&#x27;s career to lose momentum. Minor hits in 1966 were followed by flops, and in March 1968, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Day Today&quot;, gave Proby his last UK chart entry for nearly 30 years.

In 1967 Proby scored his only &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top forty hit with &quot;Niki Hoeky&quot;. In September 1968, he recorded &quot;Three Week Hero&quot;, released in 1969. A collection of country-style ballads mixed with blues, it used the New Yardbirds, later to become Led Zeppelin, as the backing band. The album was produced by Steve Rowland.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1971, he appeared as Cassio in a rock musical of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Catch My Soul&quot;. He performed in cabaret and nightclubs, singing 1960s ballads and rhythm and blues.

In 1977, he appeared as a contestant on the UK television talent show Opportunity Knocks. He wore an eye-mask and was billed as &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. Signing with Good again that year, he portrayed Elvis in &quot;Elvis – The Musical&quot; but was fired for ignoring the script and talking to the audience. Later in 1977, Proby agreed to record lead vocals on some tracks by Dutch progressive rock band Focus that were released on &quot;Focus con Proby&quot;, their final album before the group disbanded in the following year.

In the 1980s, writers David Britton and Michael Butterworth attempted to revive Proby&#x27;s career. The pair got the singer to record covers of various songs for their label Savoy Records, including &quot;Tainted Love&quot; by Gloria Jones, &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; by Joy Division, &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot; by The Sex Pistols, &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; by Prince, and &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; by Phil Collins. The project failed; Britton recalled Proby &quot;hated everything we ever did&quot; and only wanted to sing &quot;country stuff and ballads, the old-fashioned kitschy stuff.&quot;

In 1987, his Savoy Records single &quot;M97002 Hardcore&quot; credited Madonna as &quot;Second Vocal (Special Guest)&quot;, although this was untrue.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s Proby released an EP, &quot;Stage of Fools&quot;, and an album, &quot;Thanks&quot;. They were issued by J&#x27;ace Records, distributed by BMG. Granada TV featured Proby in a documentary.

In the early 1990s, Proby reappeared on stage as himself in the musical &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight&quot;, followed by playing Roy Orbison in &quot;Only The Lonely&quot;. A year later Proby returned to a new production of &quot;Elvis – The Musical&quot;, and made the album &quot;Legend&quot;. It had songwriting and production from Marc Almond, and Neal X from Sigue Sigue Sputnik. A single, &quot;Yesterday Has Gone&quot;, a duet with Almond, reached 58 on the UK Singles Chart at the end of 1996.

In 1997, Proby toured with The Who in the United States and Europe, performing as &#x27;The Godfather&#x27; in the road production of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. After &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, Proby played the UK, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Proby collaborated with Savoy Books, reading for a 1999 audiobook of David Britton&#x27;s formerly banned novel &quot;Lord Horror&quot;.

===2000s–present===
In 2002, Van Morrison recorded a song for his album &quot;Down the Road&quot; entitled &quot;Whatever Happened to P. J. Proby?&quot;.

In August 2004, Proby toured in Australia. From February until May 2006, he appeared with the &#x27;Solid Silver Sixties Show 2006&#x27; – and went through six road managers/drivers – throughout much of the UK, ending at the London Palladium.

In November 2008, Proby celebrated his 70th birthday. EMI released a 25-track retrospective, &quot;Best of the EMI Years 1961-1972&quot;. This featured his singles, eight rarities that debuted on the CD format, and two unreleased recordings (Les Reed and Barry Mason&#x27;s &quot;Delilah&quot;; and Jim Ford&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Ahead If I Can Quit While I&#x27;m Behind&quot;). Reed wrote &quot;Delilah&quot; for Proby&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Believe It Or Not&quot;, but it was omitted and became a hit for Tom Jones. Proby wrote and recorded a Christmas single entitled &quot;The Bells of Christmas Day&quot; with guitarist and producer, Andy Crump.

In 2010, Proby toured in &#x27;Sixties Gold&#x27; another revival series of shows.

In 2015, he performed in a duet with Van Morrison on the album, &quot;&quot;, singing &quot;Whatever Happened to P. J. Proby&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Proby ran into tax problems and declared himself bankrupt. Proby married and divorced several times. He had a relationship with singer Billie Davis. After years of heavy drinking, Proby turned sober in 1992 after he had a heart attack while on a beach in Florida. Proby lives in Pinvin, Worcestershire.

=== Arrests ===
Proby was once arrested in Texas for vagrancy. In 1973, Proby was jailed for the shooting of an illegally-possessed weapon after threatening his partner Claudia Martin, daughter of Dean Martin, with a gun and firing several shots.

In 2011, Proby was charged with nine counts of benefit fraud, totalling over £47,000. 
He was cleared of all charges at Worcester Crown Court in March 2012. To celebrate, Proby recorded &quot;I&#x27;m PJ.&quot; and &quot;We The Jury&quot; (which Proby wrote). Proby said: &quot;I was not dishonest when I claimed benefits, which I needed in order to live.&quot;

=== Controversies ===
In a March 2019 interview, he said he had married former wives Marianne Adams when she was 16 and he was 24, Judy Howard when she was 17 and he was 28, and Dulcie Taylor when she was 21 and he was 37. In another interview, he mentioned that he had not been in a relationship for over twenty years due to him knowing that his preference on underage girls is illegal. In the same interview, Proby admitted that his last serious relationship was in 1997 with a girl who was thirteen when he met her. Also in that same interview, he claimed that his ideal relationship is in a girl as young as twelve: &quot;I won’t marry a girl I can’t raise from the age of 12, 13 or 14. I like that they’re young and fresh-looking and don’t come with baggage, nobody’s messed with their heart and broken it. They’re still in school so I can have a hand in their education and make sure their grades are all right, make sure the way they think about religion is all right, and what is and isn’t proper.&quot;

Proby made the comments ahead of his 20-date farewell UK tour, which led to several shows being cancelled at first, followed by the whole tour. Proby disputed the accuracy of the interview in a statement to the press and to his fans.

<doc id="315644" wikidata="Q3554896" url="?curid=315644" title="Akka (spirit)">
<text>Akka is a female spirit in Sami shamanism, and Finnish and Estonian mythology. Her worship is common and took the forms of sacrifice, prayer and various other rituals. Some Sámi believe she lived under their tents. As with other gods, her name appears within some geographical names, leaving a legacy of Sami presence.

== Sami mythology ==
* Maderakka, the first akka, was mother of the tribe, goddess of women and children, she who gives humans their bodies. Women and girls belong to her, as do boys until they are declared men. Maderakka is popular among modern Sámi feminists. Her three daughters are:
** Sarakka, the goddess of fertility, menstruation, love, human sexuality, pregnancy and childbirth. After a birth, a woman would eat a special porridge dedicated to Sarakka. The modern Sámi women&#x27;s organisation The Sarahkka formed in 1988 and is named in honor of her.
** Juksakka, &quot;akka with an arrow&quot;, the protector of children.
** Uksakka, &quot;akka of the door&quot; who shapes the fetus in the mother&#x27;s womb and assigns humans their sexes.
* Jabme-Akka, &quot;the akka of the dead&quot;, is a goddess of the underworld. She soothes the spirits of dead babies, but all other spirits dwell in sorrow. Her land of the dead is said to mirror the land of the living, where everything is opposite. So, the dead are buried with the essentials of living (e.g. knives) and anything that would make their afterlife better.

==Finnish and Estonian mythologies==
In Finnish mythology, Akka is the wife of Ukko and is the goddess of fertility. As they make love, thunder rolls. She can be seen as the female side of nature, &quot;Maaemonen&quot; &quot;mother earth&quot;, whom Ukko fertilizes.

In Estonian mythology, she is known as Maa-Ema.

<text>Thomas Trail Fenton (April 8, 1930 – July 16, 2024) was a television correspondent with CBS News from 1970 until his retirement in 2004.

==Early life and education==
Fenton graduated from Dartmouth College in 1952 with a B.A. in English and was an officer in the United States Navy from 1952 to 1961, serving on destroyers in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. His Navy service placed him in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in 1952, and in the Mediterranean Sea during the 1958 Lebanon Crisis.

==Career in journalism==
After leaving the navy, Fenton began his career in journalism as a domestic and foreign correspondent for the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, where he worked from 1961 to 1969. While with the &quot;Sun&quot;, he reported on affairs in the Middle East and Europe, including the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1968 &quot;Days of May&quot; in Paris. His 1968 reporting earned Fenton an award from the Overseas Press Club.

Fenton joined CBS News as a Rome-based correspondent in 1970, and conducted the first interview with hostages taken that year by the Palestine Liberation Organization. He later reported on the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus. When Ayatollah Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran in 1979, Fenton was the first western journalist to interview Iran&#x27;s new leader. He later returned to Tehran to report on the Iran hostage crisis. 

In 1991, Fenton was in Israel during the first Gulf War to report on the effects of Scud missile attacks from Iraq. Later that year, he was in Moscow to cover the fall of the Soviet Union. During the 1990s, Fenton reported on the wars in the Balkans, and violence in the Middle East and Africa.

During his CBS career, Fenton served as the network&#x27;s Bureau Chief in Rome, Italy (1970–1973), Tel Aviv, Israel (1973–1977), Paris, France (1977–1979), London, United Kingdom (1979–1994), Moscow, Russia (1994–1996), and London again (1996–2004).

==Later life and death==
Fenton retired in 2004. Afterwards, Fenton wrote the book, &quot;Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All&quot;, published in 2005, ().

Fenton died in Novato, California, on July 16, 2024, at the age of 94.

<doc id="315659" wikidata="Q2296486" url="?curid=315659" title="Golden angle">
<text>In geometry, the golden angle is the smaller of the two angles created by sectioning the circumference of a circle according to the golden ratio; that is, into two arcs such that the ratio of the length of the smaller arc to the length of the larger arc is the same as the ratio of the length of the larger arc to the full circumference of the circle. 

Algebraically, let &quot;a+b&quot; be the circumference of a circle, divided into a longer arc of length &quot;a&quot; and a smaller arc of length &quot;b&quot; such that

:formula_1

The golden angle is then the angle subtended by the smaller arc of length &quot;b&quot;. It measures approximately ...° or in radians ... .

The name comes from the golden angle&#x27;s connection to the golden ratio &quot;φ&quot;; the exact value of the golden angle is

: formula_2

or

: formula_3

where the equivalences follow from well-known algebraic properties of the golden ratio.

As its sine and cosine are transcendental numbers, the golden angle cannot be constructed using a straightedge and compass.

== Derivation ==
The golden ratio is equal to &quot;φ&quot; = &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; given the conditions above.

Let &quot;ƒ&quot; be the fraction of the circumference subtended by the golden angle, or equivalently, the golden angle divided by the angular measurement of the circle.

:formula_4

But since

: formula_5

it follows that

:formula_6

This is equivalent to saying that &quot;φ&quot; 2 golden angles can fit in a circle.

The fraction of a circle occupied by the golden angle is therefore

:formula_7

The golden angle &quot;g&quot; can therefore be numerically approximated in degrees as:

:formula_8

or in radians as :

:formula_9

== Golden angle in nature ==
The golden angle plays a significant role in the theory of phyllotaxis; for example, the golden angle is the angle separating the florets on a sunflower. Analysis of the pattern shows that it is highly sensitive to the angle separating the individual primordia, with the Fibonacci angle giving the parastichy with optimal packing density.

Mathematical modelling of a plausible physical mechanism for floret development has shown the pattern arising spontaneously from the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation on a plane.

<doc id="315676" wikidata="Q1440401" url="?curid=315676" title="Snakeboard">
<text>A Snakeboard, also known as a Streetboard is a board that was invented in South Africa in 1989 by James Fisher, Simon King and Oliver Macleod Smith. The concept was to fuse the original skateboard with elements of snowboarding and surfing to create a fun riding experience. The first prototype was constructed using two square wooden boards, an old roller skate chopped in half, and a piece of plumbing pipe to join them together. Many variants were tried before manufacturing began. The first boards to be mass-produced were made from a strong plastic nylon known as Zytel ST801.

== Performance ==
The rider of a snakeboard stands with one foot on each footplate (the feet are usually fixed to the board using bindings) and, by moving their feet in and out in conjunction with the shoulders and hips, is able to propel the board in any direction using only body weight. This transfer of energy is called nonholonomic locomotion. The board moves in a motion similar to that of a snake—hence the sport&#x27;s original name of snakeboarding. The rider of a snakeboard can ride the board on almost any terrain (depending on the setup and model of board) and even propel himself uphill and perform extreme stunts similar to those done by skateboarders and snowboarders. Snakeboards allow riders to gain momentum without the need to push themselves with their feet like skateboarders.

== History ==
Skatex International (Pty) Ltd is the name of the first company that manufactured boards of this kind and was the inventors&#x27; original company. Skatex International licensed Snakeboard USA to sell and distribute the boards in the United States; the sport rapidly became known as &quot;snakeboarding&quot;. James Fisher, Simon King and Oliver Macleod Smith jointly owned the patents and trademarks for the sport. In the late 1990s, the inventors licensed PMS (UK), a toy retailer, to manufacturer the &quot;Sydewynder&quot; under license. Over 50,000 Sydewynders were sold in the UK and Europe. The inventors then listed their company Snakeboard International AIM market, a division of the London Stock Exchange. Later there was a reverse acquisition of Snakeboard International by a company called MV Sports. MV Sports eventually stopped manufacturing the Snakeboard. However, the sport survives today with more advanced boards and is becoming more widely known as streetboarding. The remaining snakeboard patents expired in 2011.

A snakeboard is self-propelled, and there is no need to touch a foot on the ground. Moreover, it is considerably easier to generate and maintain momentum than on a skateboard. To perform a trick, one&#x27;s feet must be strapped to the board, which makes it harder to &quot;bail out&quot; of a trick or dismount. Although the footstraps limit the amount a rider can manipulate the board, they also facilitate certain techniques. Much like a snowboarder, the rider can perform spins and somersaults higher and farther than any skateboarder. At the same time, this means a faster learning curve. While a skateboarder will spend weeks learning the most basic manoeuvres, such as the ollie, or jump, a streetboarder (snakeboarder) simply has to strap himself to the board and jump as he would without the board attached.

Toe-hooks have been developed in more recent years as an alternative to straps for riders who are not performing complex tricks. These allow the rider to jump with the board but also enable the rider to dismount from the board or &quot;bail&quot; in the event of a fall as they are not strapped to the board.Some of the pro snakeboarder were Ashley Morgan (South Africa),Kelly Dean(USA) Marnie Raath(South Africa), the twins,Lucky(South Africa) Ingo from Germany to name just a few Pro snakeboaders that traveled the globe and all over South Africa and the U.S.A 

== Names ==
Snakeboard is the brand name created by the original inventors of the board and comes from its snake-like movement. The trademark for the term snakeboard expired in 2002. The term streetboard began to be used around that time to describe any board where the wheels and trucks rotate with the rider&#x27;s feet without referring to a specific brand. The name &quot;streetboard&quot; comes from the idea that it is a &quot;snowboard for the streets&quot;. The original patent for the snakeboard refers to the board as a &quot;Pivoting Skateboard&quot; and in recent years there has been discussions around using more technically descriptive terms such as pivotboard and pivotskate. The term swingboard has also been used.

<doc id="315685" wikidata="Q15994419" url="?curid=315685" title="Early life of Isaac Newton">
<text>The following article is part of a biography of Sir Isaac Newton, the English mathematician and scientist, author of the &quot;Principia&quot;. It portrays the years after Newton&#x27;s birth in 1643, his education, as well as his early scientific contributions, before the writing of his main work, the &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, in 1685.

== Overview of Newton&#x27;s life ==
Sir Isaac Newton is known for many scientific findings. These discoveries include the laws of motion, the theory of gravity, and basic calculus. Although Newton was predominantly known for his discoveries in mathematics and physics, he also put much effort and study into chemistry, biblical history, and optics. One of Newton&#x27;s most famous writings was the &quot;Principia&quot; where he described some of his major findings of time, physics, mathematics, and calculus. Although his theories soon became universal, he faced much opposition to his early theories. Specifically, his theory of gravity faced criticism from leading scientists such as Christiaan Huygens and Leibniz. After a few years of debate, Newton&#x27;s concept of gravity became universally accepted as he became the dominant figure in the European continent.

==Birth and education==
Isaac Newton was born 25 December 1642 Old Style (4 January 1643 on the Gregorian calendar, which is now used) at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. (At the time of Newton&#x27;s birth, England had not adopted the Gregorian calendar and therefore his date of birth was recorded as 25 December, according to the Julian calendar.)

Newton was born three months after the death of his father, a prosperous farmer also named Isaac Newton. His father was described as a &quot;wealthy and uneducated man&quot;. Born prematurely, young Isaac was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: &quot;Threatening my father and mother to burn them and the house over them.&quot; Later on his mother returned after her husband died.

From age 12 to age 16, Newton resided with William Clarke, apothecary, in Grantham, where he acquired his interest in chemistry. While living with the Clarke family, Newton was educated at the free grammar school (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He spent much of his time on independent pursuits, and did poorly in school. Newton was also captivated with mechanical devices and drawing. Not only did he analyze drawings and machines, he actually constructed them himself. From windmills to clocks, Newton constructed models of many objects that surrounded him in his everyday life. He was removed from school, and by October 1659 he was to be found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed by now for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him, which he hated. Henry Stokes, master at the King&#x27;s School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. Newton&#x27;s uncle also had an influence in persuading his mother to send him back to school as he could see the natural ability of Isaac. This he did at the age of eighteen, achieving an admirable final report.
Newton lived his childhood during some of the most turbulent times in England as the Civil War began in 1642. Although the effects of the country&#x27;s issues may not have directly affected Newton, the school and universities in England were certainly impacted. Whether it was for the better or worse was to be determined, but Newton was certainly going to have a unique schooling due to the country&#x27;s unbalance.

Manuscript evidence shows that Newton&#x27;s earliest known piece writing, a Latin phrasebook, as well as the first letter in his hand which has yet been found, addressed to a ‘Loving friend’, were copied from an unpublished version of a work on Latin pedagogy by William Walker, a schoolmaster and rector whose acquaintance with Newton is documented from 1665. This suggests an early influence of the schoolmaster on the natural philosopher when he was still a schoolboy.

In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar—a sort of work-study role. At that time, the college&#x27;s teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became infinitesimal calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained his degree in August 1665, the university closed down as a precaution against the Great Plague of London. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton&#x27;s private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the next two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics and the law of gravitation. In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a fellow of Trinity.

Newton had stated that when he had purchased a book on astrology at Stourbridge fair, near Cambridge, he was unable, on account of his ignorance of trigonometry, to understand a figure of the heavens which was drawn in the book. He, therefore, bought an English edition of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; which included an index of propositions, and, having turned to two or three which he thought might be helpful, found them so obvious that he dismissed it &quot;as a trifling book&quot;, and applied himself to the study of René Descartes&#x27; &quot;Geometry&quot;. It is reported that in his examination for a scholarship at Trinity, to which he was elected on 28 April 1664, he was examined in Euclid by Isaac Barrow, who was disappointed in Newton&#x27;s lack of knowledge of the subject. Newton was convinced to read the &quot;Elements&quot; again with care, and formed a more favourable opinion of Euclid&#x27;s merit.

Newton&#x27;s study of Descartes&#x27; &quot;Geometry&quot; seems to have inspired him with a love of the subject, and introduced him to higher mathematics. In a small commonplace book, dated January 1664, there are several articles on angular sections, and the squaring of curves and &quot;crooked lines that may be squared&quot;, several calculations about musical notes, geometrical propositions from François Viète and Frans van Schooten, annotations out of John Wallis&#x27;s &quot;Arithmetic of Infinities&quot;, together with observations on refraction, on the grinding of &quot;spherical optic glasses&quot;, on the errors of lenses and the method of rectifying them, and on the extraction of all kinds of roots, particularly those &quot;in affected powers&quot;. In this same book the following entry made by Newton himself, many years afterward, gives a further account of the nature of his work during the period when he was an undergraduate:

That Newton must have begun early to make careful observations of natural phenomena is shown by the following remarks about halos, which appear in his &quot;Optics&quot;, book ii. part iv. obs. 13:

He formulated the three laws of motion:

* Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it.
* The relationship between an object&#x27;s mass &quot;m&quot;, its acceleration &quot;a&quot;, and the applied force &quot;F&quot; is &quot;F&quot; = &quot;ma&quot;. Acceleration and force are vectors (as sometimes indicated by their symbols being displayed in slant bold font); in this law, the direction of the force vector is the same as the direction of the acceleration vector.
* For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

==Academic career==
In January 1665 Newton took the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The persons appointed (in conjunction with the proctors, John Slade of Catharine Hall, Cambridge, and Benjamin Pulleyn of Trinity College, Newton&#x27;s tutor) to examine the questionists were John Eachard of Catharine Hall and Thomas Gipps of Trinity University. It is a curious accident that we have no information about the respective merits of the candidates for a degree in this year since the &quot;ordo senioritis&quot; of the Bachelors of Arts for the year is omitted in the &quot;Grace Book&quot;.

It is supposed that it was in 1665 that the method of fluxións (his term for calculus of variations) first occurred to Newton&#x27;s mind. There are several papers in Newton&#x27;s handwriting bearing dates 1665 and 1666 in which the method is described, in some of which dotted or dashed letters are used to represent fluxions (i.e. derivatives), and in some of which the method is explained without the use of dotted letters.

Both in 1665 and 1666 Trinity College was dismissed on account of the Great Plague of London. On each occasion it was agreed, as shown by entries in the &quot;Conclusion Book&quot; of the college, dated 7 August 1665, and 22 June 1666, and signed by the master of the college, Dr Pearson, that all fellows and scholars who were dismissed on account of the pestilence be allowed one month&#x27;s commons.

Newton must have left college before August 1665, as his name does not appear in the list of those who received extra commons on that occasion, and he tells us himself in the extract from his commonplace book already quoted that he was &quot;forced from Cambridge by the plague&quot; in the summer of that year. He was elected a fellow of his college on 5 October 1667. There were nine vacancies, one caused by the death of Abraham Cowley the previous summer, and the nine successful candidates were all of the same academic standings. A few weeks after his election to a fellowship Newton went to Lincolnshire and did not return to Cambridge until the following February. In March 1668, he took his M.A. degree.

During the years 1666 to 1669 Newton&#x27;s studies were very diverse. He bought prisms and lenses on two or three occasions, and also chemicals and a furnace, apparently for chemical experiments; but he also employed part of his time on the theory of fluxions and other branches of pure mathematics. He wrote a paper, &quot;De Analysi per Aequationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas&quot;, which he put, probably in June 1669, into the hands of Isaac Barrow (then Lucasian Professor of Mathematics), at the same time permitting him to communicate its contents to their common friend John Collins (1624–1683), a mathematician of no mean order. Barrow did so on 31 July 1669, but kept the name of the author a secret, and merely told Collins that he was a friend staying at Cambridge, who had a powerful genius for such matters. In a subsequent letter on 20 August, Barrow expressed his pleasure at hearing the favourable opinion which Collins had formed of the paper, and added, &quot;the name of the author is Newton, a fellow of our college, and a young man, who is only in his second year since he took the degree of Master of Arts, and who, with an unparalleled genius (&quot;examine quo est acumen&quot;), has made very great progress in this branch of mathematics&quot;. Shortly afterward, Barrow resigned his chair and was instrumental in securing Newton&#x27;s election as his successor.

Newton was elected Lucasian professor on 29 October 1670. It was his duty as professor to lecture at least once a week in term time on some portion of geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, geography, optics, statics, or some other mathematical subject, and also for two hours in the week to allow an audience to any student who might come to consult with the professor on any difficulties he had encountered. The subject which Newton chose for his lectures was optics. These lectures did little to expand his reputation, as they were remarkably sparsely attended; frequently leaving Newton to lecture at the walls of the classroom. An account of their content was presented to the Royal Society in the spring of 1672.

During the year 1684, Edmund Halley visited the home of Newton. While on his visit, Halley noted the remarkable development Newton had conducted regarding the path of objects in space such as stars and planets. Newton was convinced to step forward and introduce his findings to the general public which soon became publicized. The publication, &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot; introduced the three laws that Newton became famous for: law of inertia, summation of forces equals mass multiplied by acceleration and every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Prior to Newton, there were several other philosophers who proposed ideas to describe the motion of celestial bodies. Kepler and Galileo Galilei often studied the way objects fell in order to gain an understanding of the motion of the planets. However, by putting his theories into laws, it was Newton who achieved the most success. Students learn these concepts in grade school, being applicable to every conceivable aspect of life.

In the year 1688, Newton was elected to the convention parliament at Cambridge University where he remained on board for two years. During his time at Cambridge, he was able to meet several famous people like John Locke and Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. Newton was able to form life-long bonds with these two figures in the matter of two years. Christiaan Huygens also came into the picture as Newton and him had disagreements in the past about gravity. The two figures had several extended arguments about their debate and were able to reach accord. Soon after, Newton entered a period of life where writing became his priority. He began by editing his book, &quot;Principia&quot;. Despite the adjustments he made, the new version of &quot;Principia&quot; was abandoned by the year 1693 due to Newton&#x27;s mental state. He decaled himself as having a mental breakdown which eradicated the adjustments he made to his famous writing. Newton had a different novel that he worked on during the same time period called &quot;Praxis.&quot; This text consists of five drafts of literature written by Newton having to do with chemistry. During this period, Newton studied several areas of work including religion, calculus and chemistry.

According to Alfred Rupert Hall the first practical reflecting telescope was built by Newton in 1668. Later on, such a prototype for its design came to be called a Newtonian telescope or Newton&#x27;s reflector.

On 21 December 1671 he was proposed as a candidate for admission to the Royal Society by Dr. Seth Ward, bishop of Salisbury, and on 11 January 1672, he was elected a fellow of the Society. At the meeting at which Newton was elected, he read a description of a reflecting telescope which he had invented, and &quot;it was ordered that a letter should be written by the secretary to Mr. Newton to acquaint him of his election into the Society, and to thank him for the communication of his telescope, and to assure him that the Society would take care that all right should be done him concerning this invention.&quot; 

In his reply to the secretary on 18 January 1672, Newton writes: &quot;I desire that in your next letter you would inform me for what time the society continue their weekly meetings; because, if they continue them for any time, I am purposing them to be considered of and examined an account of a philosophical discovery, which induced me to the making of the said telescope, and which I doubt not but will prove much more grateful than the communication of that instrument being in my judgment the oddest if not the most considerable detection which hath hitherto been made into the operations of nature.&quot;

This promise was fulfilled in communication which Newton addressed to Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of the Royal Society, on 6 February 1672, and which was read before the society two days afterward. The whole is printed in No. 80 of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions.&quot;

Newton&#x27;s &quot;philosophical discovery&quot; was the realisation that white light is composed of a spectrum of colours. He realised that objects are coloured only because they absorb some of these colours more than others.

After he explained this to the Society, he proceeded: &quot;When I understood this, I left off my aforesaid glassworks; for I saw, that the perfection of telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much for want of glasses truly figured according to the prescriptions of Optics Authors (which all men have hitherto imagined), as because that light itself is a heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible rays. So that was a glass so exactly figured as to collect any one sort of rays into one point, it could not collect those also into the same point, which has the same incidence upon the same medium are apt to suffer a different refraction. Nay, I wondered, that seeing the difference of refrangibility was so great, as I found it, telescopes should arrive at that perfection they are now at.&quot; This &quot;difference in refrangibility&quot; is now known as dispersion.

He then points out why &quot;the object-glass of any telescope cannot collect all the rays which come from one point of an object, to make them convene at its focus in less room than in a circular space, whose diameter is the 50th part of the diameter of its aperture: which is an irregularity some hundreds of times greater, than a circularly figured lens, of so small a section as the object-glasses of long telescopes are, would cause by the unfitness of its figure, were light uniform.&quot; He adds: &quot;This made me take reflections into consideration, and finding them regular so that the Angle of Reflection of all sorts of Rays was equal to their Angle of Incidence; I understood, that by their mediation optic instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable, provided a reflecting substance could be found, which would polish as finely as glass, and reflect as much light, as glass transmits, and the art of communicating to it a parabolic figure be also attained. But these seemed very great difficulties, and I have almost thought them insuperable, when I further considered, that every irregularity in a reflecting superficies makes the rays stray 5 or 6 times more out of their due course, than the like irregularities in a refracting one; so that a much greater curiosity would be here requisite, than in figuring glasses for refraction.

&quot;Amidst these thoughts, I was forced from Cambridge by the intervening Plague, and it was more than two years before I proceeded further. But then having thought on a tender way of polishing, proper for metal, whereby, as I imagined, the figure also would be corrected to the last; I began to try, what might be affected in this kind, and by degrees so far perfected an instrument (in the essential parts of it like that I sent to London), by which I could discern Jupiter&#x27;s 4 Concomitants, and showed them diverse times to two others of my acquaintance. I could also discern the Moon-like phase of Venus, but not very distinctly, nor without some niceness in disposing of the instrument.

&quot;From that time I was interrupted until this last autumn when I made the other. And as that was sensibly better than the first (especially for day-objects), so I doubt not, but they will be still brought to much greater perfection by their endeavours, who, as you inform me, are taking care of it at London.&quot;

===Newton&#x27;s theory of colour===
After a remark that microscopes seem as capable of improvement as telescopes, he adds:

Further on, after some remarks on the subject of compound colours, he says:


He concludes his communication with the words: 

===Controversies===
The publication of these discoveries led to a series of controversies which lasted for several years, in which Newton had to contend with the eminent English physicist Robert Hooke, Anthony Lucas (mathematical professor at the University of Liège), Franciscus Linus (a physician in Liège), and many others. Some of his opponents denied the truth of his experiments, refusing to believe in the existence of the spectrum. Others criticised the experiments, saying that the length of the spectrum was never more than three and a half times the breadth, whereas Newton found it to be five times the breadth. It appears that Newton made the mistake of supposing that all prisms would give a spectrum of the same length; the objections of his opponents led him to measure carefully the lengths of spectra formed by prisms of different angles and different refractive indices, but he was not led thereby to the discovery of the different dispersive powers of different refractive substances.

Newton carried on the discussion with the objectors with great courtesy and patience, but the pain which these long discussions gave to his sensitive mind may be estimated from his letter of 18 November 1676 to Oldenburg: &quot;I promised to send you an answer to Mr. Lucas this next Tuesday, but I find I shall scarce finish what I have designed, to get a copy taken of it by that time, and therefore I beg your patience a week longer. I see I have made myself a slave to philosophy, but if I get free of Mr. Lucas&#x27;s business, I will resolutely bid adieu to it eternally, excepting what I do for my private satisfaction, or leave to come out after me; for I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or to become a slave to defend it.&quot;

These disputes did not damp Newton&#x27;s ardour as much as he feared. He later published many papers in the Philosophical Transactions on various aspects of optics, and, although some of his views are erroneous, and are now almost universally rejected, his investigations led to discoveries which are of permanent value. He succeeded in explaining the colour of thin and of thick plates (diffraction), and the inflexion of light, and he wrote on double refraction, light polarisation and binocular vision. He also invented a reflecting quadrant for observing the angles between the Moon and the fixed stars— the same in every essential as the historically important navigational instrument more commonly known as Hadley&#x27;s quadrant. This discovery was communicated by him to Edmund Halley in 1700 but was not published, or communicated to the Royal Society, until after Newton&#x27;s death, when a description of it was found among his papers.

==Conflict over oratorship elections==
In March 1673 Newton took a prominent part in a dispute in the university. The public oratorship fell vacant, and a contest arose between the heads of the colleges and the members of the Senate as to the mode of electing to the office. The heads claimed the right of nominating two persons, one of whom was to be elected by the senate. The senate insisted that the proper mode was by an open election. George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who was the chancellor of the university, endeavoured to effect a compromise which, he says, &quot;I hope may for the present satisfy both sides. I propose that the heads may for this time nominate and the body comply, yet interposing (if they think fit) a protestation concerning their plea that this election may not hereafter pass for a decisive precedent in prejudice of their claim&quot;, and, &quot;whereas I understand that the whole university has chiefly consideration for Dr Henry Paman of St John&#x27;s College and Mr. Craven of Trinity College, I do recommend them both to be nominated.&quot; The heads, however, nominated Drs Paman and Ralph Sanderson (of St John&#x27;s); the next day 121 members of the senate recorded their votes for Craven and ninety-eight for Paman. On the morning of the election, a protest in which Newton&#x27;s name appeared was read and entered in the Regent House. But the vice-chancellor admitted Paman the same morning, and so ended the first contest of a non-scientific character in which Newton took part. 

==Newton&#x27;s poverty==
On 8 March 1673 Newton wrote to Oldenburg, the secretary of the Royal Society:&quot;Sir, I desire that you will procure that I may be put out from being any longer Fellow of the Royal Society: for though I honour that body, yet since I see I shall neither profit them nor (because of this distance) can partake of the advantage of their assemblies, I desire to withdraw.&quot;

Oldenburg replied to this with an offer to apply to the Society to excuse Newton the weekly payments, as in a letter of Newton&#x27;s to Oldenburg, dated 23 June 1673, he says, &quot;For your proffer about my quarterly payments, I thank you, but I would not have you trouble yourself to get them excused if you have not done it already.&quot; Nothing further seems to have been done in the matter until 28 January 1675, when Oldenburg informed the Society that &quot;Mr. Newton is now in such circumstances that he desires to be excused from the weekly payments.&quot; Upon this &quot;it was agreed to by the council that he be dispensed with, as several others are.&quot; 

On 18 February 1675 Newton was formally accepted into the Society. The most probable reason why Newton wished to be excused from these payments is that, as he was not in holy orders, his fellowship at Trinity College would lapse in autumn 1675, with a consequent reduction in his income. But he received a patent from the Crown in April 1675, allowing him as Lucasian professor to retain his fellowship without being required to take holy orders. This must have relieved Newton&#x27;s financial worries since in November 1676 he donated £40 towards the building of the new library of Trinity College.

==Universal law of gravitation==

It is supposed that it was at Woolsthorpe in the summer of 1666 that Newton&#x27;s thoughts were directed to the subject of gravity. They are said to have been inspired by Newton&#x27;s seeing an apple fall from a tree on his mother&#x27;s farm, a version for which there is reasonable historical evidence. In one version of the story, the apple is supposed to have fallen on Newton&#x27;s head; this version appears to have been invented by Isaac D&#x27;Israeli. Voltaire is the authority for the former version of the story. He had his information from Newton&#x27;s favourite niece Catherine Barton, who married John Conduitt, a fellow of the Royal Society, and one of Newton&#x27;s intimate friends. How much truth there is in what is a plausible and a favourite story can never be known, but it is certain that tradition marked a tree as that from which the apple fell, until 1866, when, owing to decay, the tree was cut down and its wood carefully preserved.

Johannes Kepler had proved by an elaborate series of measurements that

* each planet revolves in an elliptical orbit around the Sun, whose centre occupies one of the foci of the ellipse,
* that the radius vector of each planet drawn from the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times,
* and that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.

The fact that heavy bodies always have a tendency to fall to the Earth, no matter at what height they are placed above the Earth&#x27;s surface, seems to have led Newton to conjecture that the same tendency to fall to the Earth might have been the cause by which the Moon was retained in its orbit around the Earth.

Newton, by calculating from Kepler&#x27;s laws, and supposing the orbits of the planets to be circles with the sun at the centre, had already proved that the force of the Sun acting upon the different planets must vary as the inverse square of the distances of the planets from the Sun. He was therefore led to inquire whether if the Earth&#x27;s attraction extended to the Moon, the force at that distance would be of the exact magnitude necessary to retain the Moon in its orbit. He found that the Moon by its motion in its orbit was deflected from the tangent in every minute through a space of 13 feet (3.96 m). But by observing the distance through which a body would fall in one second at the Earth&#x27;s surface, and by calculating from that on the supposition of the force diminishing in the ratio of the inverse square of the distance, he found that the Earth&#x27;s attraction at the distance of the Moon would draw a body through 15 ft. (4.57 metres) in one minute. Newton regarded the discrepancy between the results as proof of the inaccuracy of his conjecture, and &quot;laid aside at that time any further thoughts of this matter&quot;. (See Newton&#x27;s cannonball.)

In November 1679, Robert Hooke (after his appointment to manage the Royal Society&#x27;s correspondence) began an exchange of letters with Newton: he wished to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others. The correspondence later led to controversy. Hooke and Newton disagreed about the form of the path of a body falling from a height, taking the motion of the Earth around its axis into consideration. Newton later acknowledged that the exchanges of 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomy. This led Newton to revert to his former conjectures on the Moon. The estimate Newton had used for the radius of the Earth, which had been accepted by geographers and navigators, was based on the very rough estimate that the length of a degree of latitude of the Earth&#x27;s surface measured along a meridian was 60 nautical miles. At a meeting of the Royal Society on 11 January 1672, Oldenburg, the secretary, read a letter from Paris describing the procedure followed by Jean Picard in measuring a degree, and specifically stating the precise length that he calculated it to be. It is probable that Newton had become acquainted with this measurement of Picard&#x27;s, and that he was therefore led to make use of it when his thoughts were redirected to the subject. This estimate of the Earth&#x27;s magnitude, giving 691 miles (1112  km) to 10°, made the two results, the discrepancy between which Newton had regarded as a disproof of his conjecture, to agree so exactly that he now regarded his conjecture as fully established.

In January 1684, Sir Christopher Wren, Halley and Hooke were led to discuss the law of gravity, and although they probably all agreed on the truth of the inverse square law, yet this truth was not looked upon as established. It appears that Hooke professed to have a solution of the problem of the path of a body moving around a centre of force attracting as the inverse square of the distance, but Halley declared after a delay of some months that Hooke &quot;had not been so good as his word&quot; in showing his solution to Wren and started for Cambridge, in August 1684, to consult Newton on the subject. Without mentioning the speculations which had been made, he asked Newton what would be the curve described by a planet around the Sun on the assumption that the Sun&#x27;s force diminished as the square of the distance. Newton replied promptly, &quot;an ellipse&quot;, and on being questioned by Halley as to the reason for his answer he replied, &quot;Why, I have calculated it.&quot; He could not, however, put his hand upon his calculation, but he promised to send it to Halley. After the latter had left Cambridge, Newton set to work to reproduce the calculation. After making a mistake and producing a different result he corrected his work and obtained his former result.

Next November, Newton redeemed his promise to Halley by sending him, by the hand of Mr. Paget, a fellow of Trinity College and mathematical master of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, a copy of his demonstration; and very soon afterward Halley again visited Cambridge to confer with Newton about the problem. On his return to London on 10 December 1684, he informed the Royal Society &quot;that he had lately seen Mr. Newton at Cambridge, who had shown him a curious treatise &quot;De Motu&quot;&quot;, which at Halley&#x27;s desire he promised to send to the Society to be entered upon their register. &quot;Mr. Halley was desired to put Mr. Newton in mind of his promise for the securing this invention to himself, till he could be at leisure to publish it&quot;, and Paget was desired to join with Halley in urging Newton to do so. By the middle of February Newton had sent his paper to Aston, one of the secretaries of the Society, and in a letter to Aston dated 23 February 1685, Newton thanked him for &quot;having entered on the register his notions about motion&quot;. This treatise &quot;De Motu&quot; was the starting point of the &quot;Principia&quot;, and was meant to be a short account of what that work was intended to embrace. It occupies twenty-four octavo pages, and consists of four theorems and seven problems, some of which are identical with some of the most important propositions of the second and third sections of the first book of the &quot; Principia&quot;.

<text>The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (also &quot;LMRDA&quot; or the Landrum–Griffin Act), is a US labor law that regulates labor unions&#x27; internal affairs and their officials&#x27; relationships with employers.

==Background==
After enactment of the Taft–Hartley Act in 1947, the number of union victories in National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)-conducted elections declined. During the 12-year administration of the Wagner Act, which was enacted in 1935, unions won victories in over 80 percent of elections. But in that first year after passage of the Taft–Hartley Act in 1947, unions won only around 70 percent of the representation elections conducted by the agency.

During the mid-to-late 1950s, the labor movement was under intense Congressional scrutiny for corruption, racketeering, and other misconduct. Enacted in 1959 after revelations of corruption and undemocratic practices in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association, United Mine Workers and other unions received widespread attention, the Act requires unions to hold secret elections for local union offices on a regular basis and provides for review by the United States Department of Labor of union members&#x27; claims of improper election activity. Organized labor opposed the act because it strengthened the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947.

It was sponsored by Democrat Phil Landrum and Republican Robert P. Griffin. The drafting was assisted by Clyde Summers.

==Content==
Important provisions of the law were as follows:
* Unions had to hold secret elections, reviewable by the Department of Labor.
* Union members are protected against abuses by a bill of rights including guarantees of freedom of speech and periodic secret elections of officers.
* Members of the Communist Party and convicted felons were barred from holding union office. The bar on Communist Party members was ruled unconstitutional in 1965 in the case &quot;United States v. Brown&quot;.
* Unions had to submit annual financial reports to the DOL.
* Every union officer must act as a fiduciary in handling the assets and conducting the affairs of the union.
* Unions&#x27; power to put subordinate bodies in trusteeship, a temporary suspension of democratic processes within a union, was limited.
* Minimum standards were made before a union could expel or take other disciplinary action against a member of the union.

The LMRDA covers both workers and unions covered by the National Labor Relations Act (&quot;Wagner Act&quot;) and workers and unions in the railroad and airline industries, who are covered by the Railway Labor Act. The LMRDA does not, as a general rule, cover public sector employees, who are not covered by either the NLRA or the RLA. The LMRDA likewise does not displace state laws governing unions&#x27; relations with their members except to the extent that those state laws would conflict with federal law.

Congress also amended the National Labor Relations Act, as part of the same piece of legislation that created the LMRDA, by tightening the Taft–Hartley Act&#x27;s prohibitions against secondary boycotts and prohibiting certain types of &quot;hot cargo&quot; agreements, under which an employer agreed to cease doing business with other employers, and empowered the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board to seek an injunction against a union that engages in recognitional picketing of an employer for more than thirty days without filing a petition for representation with the NLRB.

Union members may enforce their LMRDA rights through private lawsuit or, in some cases, through the US Department of Labor.

==Subsequent operation==
Twenty years after the passage of the Act, co-sponsor Senator Robert Griffin wrote,

Today, nearly two decades after enactment, it is undeniable that the Landrum–Griffin Act has played a significant role in enabling union members to participate more freely in the affairs of their unions. On the other hand, it cannot be said that union corruption and abuses of union power have disappeared. But such conduct in the union movement is not as common as it was twenty years ago; and, in large measure, that can be credited to the existence of the Landrum–Griffin Act.

Griffin acknowledged the shortcomings, particularly with regard to the Teamsters. However, Griffin argued that the violations were contrary to the Act, placing the blame instead on the Department of Labor for failing to pursue action against the Teamsters for its corruption.

===Voting===
The Act stressed for union members to be guaranteed, as part of a Bill of Rights, the right to a secret ballot on certain issues facing the union at large. However, in naming certain aspects of union function, such as dues, constitution, bylaws, membership, and not others, the Act opened the door for abuses. For instance, a vote on the union constitution would require that each member have the right to see the proposed changes, distribute information in support or opposition thereof, and have their union bound by the result of the election. However, if a ratification vote was not under one of these named clauses, the protections did not apply under the Act, and union officials could act as they saw fit, regardless of the sentiment of general membership.

===Collective bargaining===
Likewise, the Act addressed the issue of collective bargaining but only in externalities such as reporting thereof. It did not address the question of whether such agreements required any consent from the union members or locals. Furthermore, in allowing for trusteeship in such instances, the Act allowed for union officials to exert greater control over the will of their members. In one court case on the matter, an Oklahoma City local attempted to leave one union body to affiliate with another. The original union put it under trusteeship to block the transfer, and the court upheld the move as legal under the Act. As law professor Alan Hyde put it, &quot;the courts advance democratic bargaining only when assured that such democracy will not disadvantage more fundamental policy interests, such as harmony between employers and &#x27;unions&#x27; (read union elites) or control of inflation.&quot;

===Pensions===
With regard to retiree pensions, among other secondary issues, the Act did nothing to close the loophole created by the National Labor Relations Act to allow such &#x27;permissive&#x27; or &#x27;not mandatory&#x27; items from being dealt with by a union employer unilaterally, a right which was upheld by the Supreme Court as late as 1971 in &quot;Allied Chemical Workers Local 1 v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company&quot;. Likewise, in 1980, the Supreme Court affirmed the right of union international offices to negotiate a pension plan in conflict with that supported by the members when union bylaws allowed for approval by international.

===Persuader Rule===
President Barack Obama used the Act as authority to issue the &quot;Persuader Rule&quot;, which required an employer&#x27;s attorney to publicly disclose advice provided to persuade against unionization. The National Federation of Independent Business sued and, on November 16, 2016, U.S. District Judge Samuel Ray Cummings issued a permanent nationwide injunction blocking the Persuader Rule, finding it was not authorized by the Act, and that it violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In video games, she provided the voice of EVA in the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series (2004–10).

For her contributions to Disney, Benson was named a Disney Legend in 2011.

==Personal life==
Benson was born and raised in a Catholic family, graduating from Boylan Central Catholic High School in Rockford, Illinois, and Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois.

She experienced a religious conversion while dating actor/singer Ray Benson (not to be confused with frontman Ray Benson of Asleep at the Wheel). The two of them later married in 1984, and eventually had two children, a son (born 1999) and a daughter (born 2001). An article originally published in 2013 by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said the couple &quot;live north of Atlanta, GA.&quot; In May 2024, Benson revealed to 11 Alive News in connection with her upcoming appearance at MomoCon in Atlanta that she lives in the Lake Lanier area.

==Career==

Benson made her debut in the 1983 Kenny Ortega-directed &quot;&quot;. Other Broadway credits include a starring role in the 1986 Broadway musical &quot;Smile&quot;, where she introduced a song called &quot;Disneyland&quot;. In 1987, Howard Ashman, the lyricist of &quot;Smile&quot;, would go on to write the lyrics for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. She describes the song &quot;Disneyland&quot; at the &quot;Smile&quot; Reunion concert held on September 22, 2014, &quot;This is the first piece of the puzzle of my life, the first step of the journey, so to speak&quot;. Benson also sings &quot;Disneyland&quot; on a compilation CD called &quot;Unsung Musicals&quot;. In 1989, Benson appeared in the Broadway musical, &quot;Welcome to the Club&quot;, alongside Samuel E. Wright, who performed the voice for Sebastian the Crab in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

In 1992, Benson received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical for her role as Polly Baker in &quot;Crazy For You&quot;. She played the narrator in &quot;Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; in 1998.

In 2004, Benson voiced the character of EVA in the video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;. Due to her association with children-oriented projects, she was advised by voice director Kris Zimmerman to adopt a pseudonym for the game; her credited name, &quot;Suzetta Miñet&quot;, was coined by Zimmerman based on the name of Benson&#x27;s pet dog during her childhood, Suzette Monet. For two decades after the game&#x27;s release, Miñet&#x27;s true identity was the subject of scrutiny and speculation among fans until Benson officially revealed her involvement during the promotion of the game&#x27;s remake, &quot;Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&quot;, in November 2024.

In 2004–06, Benson contributed as the host and narrator of the children&#x27;s Christian home video series called &quot;Baby Faith&quot;, created by Integrity Publishers &amp; FamilyTreeMedia.

In 2007, she played the secretary Sam in Disney&#x27;s live-action/animated film, &quot;Enchanted&quot;. Benson also played the Queen in a one-night concert version of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein″s &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Nashville Symphony Orchestra in May 2010.

She was at the 2012 SYTA conference singing her signature song &quot;Part of Your World&quot; on August 27, 2012.

She joined the &quot;2013 Spring Pops&quot; on May 14–15, 2013 as a guest soloist with the Boston Pops. Benson has been a frequent celebrity narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World, appearing most recently in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021. 

Benson can be heard on over a dozen recordings. Her animated TV series include the Emmy Award-winning &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot; for Cartoon Network, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, &quot;Barbie&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;P. J. Sparkles&quot;, and the series &quot;Sofia the First&quot; for Disney.

On the concert stage, Benson has performed as a concert soloist with symphonies all over the world, including The Boston Pops, The Philly Pops (conductor: Peter Nero), The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra (conductor: John Mauceri), The National Symphony (conductor: Marvin Hamlisch), Cleveland, Dallas, Tokyo, and the San Francisco and Chicago Symphonies. She starred in the Kennedy Center Honors for Ginger Rogers, and in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Premiere in Central Park with Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;The Walt Disney World 25th Anniversary Spectacular&quot; and &quot;Disney&#x27;s 100 Years of Magic&quot;. Benson is the resident guest soloist for the Walt Disney Company/Disney Cruise Line and ambassador for feature animation.

On June 6, 2016, Benson performed the role of Ariel at the Hollywood Bowl&#x27;s concert performance of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. She also made a special appearance in ABC&#x27;s 2019 live musical spectacular &quot;The Little Mermaid Live!&quot; Benson was originally going to reprise her role as Sam in the 2022 film &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, but her scene was cut from the movie. She recently lent her voice to Ariel in the 2022 video game &quot;Disney Dreamlight Valley&quot; as well as singing as Ariel on various Disney Princess albums of the 2000s. From 1992 to 2011 she was the official voice of Barbie for Mattel and Pixar for projects such as &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Dance! Workout with Barbie&quot;, until the role was taken over by Kate Higgins starting with the series &quot;Life in the Dreamhouse&quot;.

In June 2023, Benson starred as Mama Rose in a concert production of &quot;Gypsy&quot; alongside her daughter Delany at the Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall in Fort Myers, Florida. The two of them reprised their roles in a 2025 production at the OFC Creations Theatre Center in Rochester, New York. Benson portrayed Dolly Gallagher Levi in a concert production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Orlando, Florida from June 21-22, 2024. 

===&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;===

In late 1986, Benson first heard of the audition for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; through lyricist and playwright Howard Ashman. The two had just worked together in the Broadway show &quot;Smile&quot; until its run ended early. He knew she would be the perfect fit for the role and that she would be a great replica of Ariel. After hearing the demo for &quot;Part of Your World&quot;, she sang a small part of it on tape where it was later sent to Disney executives. Before her audition for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, she was primarily a stage actress. It was Ashman&#x27;s first Disney project. In early 1988, Benson won the role of Ariel and has been voicing her ever since. She also made a cameo in the 2023 live-action adaptation of the film, directed by Rob Marshall, as a market vendor who hands Ariel (Halle Bailey) a fork during her tour of the kingdom.

<doc id="315707" wikidata="Q5373193" url="?curid=315707" title="Emmanuel College (Massachusetts)">
<text>Emmanuel College is a private Roman Catholic college in Boston, Massachusetts. The college was founded by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur as the first women&#x27;s Catholic college in New England in 1919. In 2001, the college officially became a coeducational institution. It is a member of the Colleges of the Fenway consortium. In addition to the Fenway campus, Emmanuel operates a living and learning campus in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

==History==
The Emmanuel College Administration Building was built in 1919 by the architecture firm Maginnis &amp; Walsh. Maginnis &amp; Walsh are also known for building Gasson Hall at Boston College and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. The Administration Building at Emmanuel College is notable for its early 20th century Gothic architecture.

In the early years, Emmanuel was a day college preparing women for professional fields such as education, nursing, and social work. Despite being commuters, students were involved in numerous co-curricular activities including student publications and athletics. The 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s saw growth not only in the student population, academic programs and activities, but also in the physical campus, with additional land purchases on Brookline Avenue and Avenue Louis Pasteur. In 1949, the college completed the construction of Alumnae Hall, a science center, the first building constructed on campus after the original Administration Building.

The trustees of the college were incorporated by the state in 1921.

John F. Kennedy served on the college&#x27;s advisory board from 1946 until his death in 1963.

Longtime President Sister Janet Eisner, who had presided over years of enrollment decline and sought to save the college from closure, oversaw a signed agreement with Merck Pharmaceuticals. With this, the college agreed to lease a portion of its campus for a new research laboratory to Merck for 75 years and approximately $50 million. The agreement made Emmanuel the only college in the country with a pharmaceutical lab on campus.

At the same time, Emmanuel started admitting men, enrolling its first undergraduate male students in 2001. The financially stabilizing alliance with Merck permitted Emmanuel to begin building new dorms and buying back buildings it had sold in leaner times. Going co-ed and improving the campus sparked a sustained revival that made Emmanuel one of the fastest-growing colleges in New England at that time. Emmanuel&#x27;s building plan also included the Jean Yawkey Student Center, which opened in 2004 as the first new building on campus in 35 years.

The college administration used the windfall to secure millions in federal science grants to fund the construction of a $50 million science center. The Maureen Murphy Wilkens Science Center opened in the fall of 2009, effectively doubling the academic space of the campus. The Wilkens Center is four floors and 47,500 feet and contains faculty/student research space and offices, student study areas, new classrooms for all academic areas, 120 underground parking spaces, as well as teaching laboratories for Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry and Physics.

In 2016, Julie Hall was torn down to make way for a new apartment-style 18-floor residence hall. Built for a cost of $140 million, the cost of the project was the same as Emmanuel&#x27;s total endowment. The resulting residence hall opened in 2018, provides 692 beds of apartment-style housing to upper-class Emmanuel students and approximately 250 students from nearby Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, generating additional revenue.

Emmanuel College celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2019. In 2022, President Janet Eisner retired, and Mary K. Boyd was named the college&#x27;s 13th president. She abruptly resigned the following year. In August 2023, Dr. Beth Ross was named Acting President. In January 2024, Dr. Beth Ross was named the college&#x27;s 14th president.

==Campus==

Emmanuel&#x27;s 17-acre campus is located adjacent to the Longwood Medical District in the Fenway area of Boston. The gated campus consists of 11 buildings, including seven academic buildings and four dormitories. Academic buildings include the original Administration Building, the Cardinal Cushing Library, the Jean Yawkey Center, Marian Hall, the Maureen Murphy Wilkens Science Center and Merck Research Laboratories-Boston.

Approximately 75% of Emmanuel&#x27;s traditional undergraduates reside in the residence halls on campus, while the remainder commute from the local area.

==Sexual assault cases==
In 2016, a female student decided to leave Emmanuel College in her sophomore year to protest the fact that a male student she said had raped her in 2015 was found “not responsible” for assaulting her by the university administration, after administrators advised her to let the college handle the allegations, rather than police.

Her announcement, which complained that the university &quot;did not think a rape kit and countless accounts of the night were sufficient evidence to find the male student [accountable],&quot;, received significant media attention. Boston.com reported, &quot;The college issued a statement in response, and said it handles all cases in a comprehensive manner that fully complies with Title IX.&quot;

In 2018, a male student who was determined to be responsible for “all forms of sexual misconduct including any form of unwanted sexual advances and contact” during an academic hearing, was allowed to remain on campus. The student was later featured in an Emmanuel College athletics promotional video. The college&#x27;s decision to feature him prompted the female student who made the allegations of assault to take to the matter to social media. Emmanuel&#x27;s vice president of college relations, Molly DiLorenzo, later told the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; that the video “did not violate any conditions of the student conduct process,” but that “it is unfortunate that the posting happened.” DiLorenzo also told the Globe, “no individual found responsible for rape...has been allowed to remain enrolled at Emmanuel College.”

In 2020, &quot;The Spectrum&quot; reported that 10 rapes and 7 instances of nonconsensual fondling had been reported on the Emmanuel College campus between 2014 and 2019. Looking at the 2019 data, &quot;College Factual&quot; found that, in raw numbers, Emmanuel had more reported incidents of violence against women on campus than other universities nationwide. It also noted that 67% of college campuses recorded 0 instances of reported violence against women in the same period.

In a story on the sexual assault reports and their administrative handling, Emmanuel College campus newspaper, &quot;The Hub,&quot; noted that survivors&#x27; stories from 2015 onward shared the common theme, &quot;the drive for justice and a need for change.&quot;

In response to allegations of sexual assault, students planned a series of protests, including a Day of Silence in May 2020, to raise attention to what organizers claim was the school&#x27;s pattern of failure to adequately manage incidents of sexual assault on campus. The protestors called on President Janet Eisner and her administration to implement zero-tolerance sexual assault policies. The college responded to the protests with a Title IX listening session, and the initiation of a “campus climate task force.”

==Athletics==
Emmanuel athletic teams are the Saints. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC) since the 1995–96 academic year.

Emmanuel competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball. Club and intramural sports include men&#x27;s baseball, women&#x27;s dance, women&#x27;s field hockey, co-ed sailing and co-ed cheerleading. Former sports included women&#x27;s tennis, which competed until after the 2013 spring season (2012–13 school year). Emmanuel began to sponsor men&#x27;s sports since the college became co-educational, effective in the 2001–02 school year.

===Clemente Field===
In the summer 2009, Emmanuel College partnered with the City of Boston for the $4 million comprehensive restoration of Roberto Clemente Field, a city-owned field located in the Back Bay Fens across the street from the campus in the Emerald Necklace. The renovations included an upgraded 120,000 sq. ft. NCAA-regulation synthetic turf field, a three-lane rubberized all-weather track, Musco lighting, practice facilities for expanded track and field events, a new scoreboard, as well as spectator stands and handicapped seating. The field serves as home for Emmanuel softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams, as well as the practice facility for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field. The field is open to the public, and is used by Boston Latin School athletics, Fenway High School gym classes, Colleges of the Fenway intramurals, and adult and young summer softball leagues. The City of Boston-Emmanuel agreements is valid for 10 years and will presumably be revisited in 2019. . The track is approximately 422 meters long.

<text>Sir Marcus Laurence Elwin Oliphant, (8 October 1901 – 14 July 2000) was an Australian physicist and humanitarian who played an important role in the first experimental demonstration of nuclear fusion and in the development of nuclear weapons.

Born and raised in Adelaide, South Australia, Oliphant graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1922. He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1927 on the strength of the research he had done on mercury, and went to England, where he studied under Sir Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory. There, he used a particle accelerator to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons) at various targets. He discovered the respective nuclei of helium-3 (helions) and of tritium (tritons). He also discovered that when they reacted with each other, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus, and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion.

Oliphant left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1937 to become the Poynting Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham. He attempted to build a cyclotron at the university, but its completion was postponed by the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in 1939. He became involved with the development of radar, heading a group at the University of Birmingham that included John Randall and Harry Boot. They created a radical new design, the cavity magnetron, that made microwave radar possible. Oliphant also formed part of the MAUD Committee, which reported in July 1941, that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. Oliphant was instrumental in spreading the word of this finding in the United States, thereby starting what became the Manhattan Project. Later in the war, he worked on it with his friend Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, developing electromagnetic isotope separation, which provided the fissile component of the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945.

After the war, Oliphant returned to Australia as the first director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the new Australian National University (ANU), where he initiated the design and construction of the world&#x27;s largest (500 megajoule) homopolar generator. He retired in 1967, but was appointed Governor of South Australia on the advice of Premier Don Dunstan. He became the first South Australian-born governor of South Australia. He assisted in the founding of the Australian Democrats political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977, at which the party was launched. Late in life he witnessed his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. He died in Canberra in 2000.

== Early life ==
Marcus &quot;Mark&quot; Laurence Elwin Oliphant was born on 8 October 1901 in Kent Town, a suburb of Adelaide. His father was Harold George &quot;Baron&quot; Olifent, a civil servant with the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department and part-time lecturer in economics with the Workers&#x27; Educational Association. His mother was Beatrice Edith Fanny Oliphant, née Tucker, an artist. He was named after Marcus Clarke, the Australian author, and Laurence Oliphant, the British traveller and mystic. Most people called him Mark; this became official when he was knighted in 1959. 

He had four younger brothers: Roland, Keith, Nigel and Donald; all were registered at birth with the surname Olifent. His grandfather, Harry Smith Olifent (7 November 1848 – 30 January 1916) was a clerk at the Adelaide GPO, and his great-grandfather James Smith Olifent (c. 1818 – 21 January 1890) and his wife Eliza (c. 1821 – 18 October 1881) left their native Kent for South Australia aboard the barque &quot;Ruby&quot;, arriving in March 1854. He would later be appointed Superintendent of the Adelaide Destitute Asylum, and Eliza Olifent was appointed Matron of the establishment in 1865. Mark&#x27;s parents were Theosophists, and as such may have refrained from eating meat. Marcus became a lifelong vegetarian while a boy, after witnessing the slaughter of pigs on a farm. He was found to be completely deaf in one ear and he needed glasses for severe astigmatism and short-sightedness.

Oliphant was first educated at primary schools in Goodwood and Mylor, after the family moved there in 1910. He attended Unley High School in Adelaide, and, for his final year in 1918, Adelaide High School. After graduation he failed to obtain a bursary to attend university, so he took a job with S. Schlank &amp; Co., an Adelaide manufacturing jeweller noted for medallions. He then secured a cadetship with the State Library of South Australia, which allowed him to take courses at the University of Adelaide at night.

In 1919, Oliphant began studying at the University of Adelaide. At first he was interested in a career in medicine, but later in the year, Kerr Grant, the physics professor, offered him a cadetship in the Physics Department. It paid 10 shillings a week (), the same amount that Oliphant received for working at the State Library, but it allowed him to take any university course that did not conflict with his work for the department. He received his Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in 1921 and then did honours in 1922, supervised by Grant. Roy Burdon, who acted as head of the department when Grant went on sabbatical in 1925, worked with Oliphant to produce two papers in 1927 on the properties of mercury, &quot;The Problem of the Surface Tension of Mercury and the Action of Aqueous Solutions on a Mercury Surface&quot; and &quot;Adsorption of Gases on the Surface of Mercury&quot;. Oliphant later recalled that Burdon taught him &quot;the extraordinary exhilaration there was in even minor discoveries in the field of physics&quot;.

Oliphant married Rosa Louise Wilbraham, who was from Adelaide, on 23 May 1925. The two had known each other since they were teenagers. He made Rosa&#x27;s wedding ring in the laboratory from a gold nugget from the Coolgardie Goldfields that his father had given him.

== Cavendish Laboratory ==
In 1925, Oliphant heard a speech given by the New Zealand physicist Sir Ernest Rutherford, and he decided he wanted to work for him – an ambition that he fulfilled by earning a position at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1927. He applied for an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship on the strength of the research he had done on mercury with Burdon. It came with a living allowance of £250 per annum (). When word came through that he had been awarded a fellowship, he wired Rutherford and Trinity College, Cambridge. Both accepted him.
Rutherford&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory was carrying out some of the most advanced research into nuclear physics in the world at the time. Oliphant was invited to afternoon tea by Rutherford and Lady Rutherford. He soon met other researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory, including Patrick Blackett, Edward Bullard, James Chadwick, John Cockcroft, Charles Ellis, Peter Kapitza, Egon Bretscher, Philip Moon and Ernest Walton. There were two fellow Australians: Harrie Massey and John Keith Roberts. Oliphant would become especially close friends with Cockcroft. The laboratory had considerable talent but little money to spare, and tended to use a &quot;string and sealing wax&quot; approach to experimental equipment. Oliphant had to buy his own equipment, at one point spending £24 () of his allowance on a vacuum pump.

Oliphant submitted his PhD thesis on &quot;The Neutralization of Positive Ions at Metal Surfaces, and the Emission of Secondary Electrons&quot; in December 1929. For his &quot;viva&quot;, he was examined by Rutherford and Ellis. Receiving his degree was the attainment of a major life goal, but it also meant the end of his 1851 Exhibition Scholarship. Oliphant secured an 1851 Senior Studentship, of which there were five awarded each year. It came with a living allowance of £450 per annum () for two years, with the possibility of a one-year extension in exceptional circumstances, which Oliphant was also awarded.

A son, Geoffrey Bruce Oliphant, was born 6 October 1930, but he died of meningitis on 5 September 1933. He was interred in an unmarked grave in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge, alongside Timothy Cockcroft, the infant son of Sir John and Lady Elizabeth Cockcroft, who had died the year before. Unable to have more children, the Oliphants adopted a four-month-old boy, Michael John, in 1936, and a daughter, Vivian, in 1938.
In 1932 and 1933, the scientists at the Cavendish Laboratory made a series of ground-breaking discoveries. Cockcroft and Walton bombarded lithium with high energy protons and succeeded in transmuting it into energetic nuclei of helium. This was one of the earliest experiments to change the atomic nucleus of one element to another by artificial means. Chadwick then devised an experiment that discovered a new, uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton: the neutron. In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his cloud chamber that confirmed the existence of the positron and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron–electron pair production.

Oliphant followed up the work by constructing a particle accelerator that could fire protons with up to 600,000 electronvolts of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockcroft and Walton on the artificial disintegration of the nucleus and positive ions. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received a gift from the American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis of a few drops of heavy water. The accelerator was used to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (&quot;deuterons&quot;, which Rutherford called &quot;diplons&quot;) at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of helium-3 (&quot;helions&quot;) and tritium (&quot;tritons&quot;).

Oliphant used electromagnetic separation to separate the isotopes of lithium. He was the first to experimentally demonstrate nuclear fusion. He found that when deuterons reacted with nuclei of helium-3, tritium or with other deuterons, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Binding energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus. Following Arthur Eddington&#x27;s 1920 prediction that energy released by fusing small nuclei together could provide the energy source that powers the stars, Oliphant speculated that nuclear fusion reactions might be what powered the sun. With its higher cross section, the deuterium–tritium nuclear fusion reaction became the basis of a hydrogen bomb. Oliphant had not foreseen this development:

In 1934, Cockcroft arranged for Oliphant to become a fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, which paid about £600 a year. When Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory for the University of Liverpool in 1935, Oliphant and Ellis both replaced him as Rutherford&#x27;s assistant director for research. The job came with a salary of £600 (). With the money from St John&#x27;s, this gave him a comfortable income. Oliphant soon fitted out a new accelerator laboratory with a 1.23 MeV generator at a cost of £6,000 () while he designed an even larger 2 MeV generator. He was the first to conceive of the proton synchrotron, a new type of cyclic particle accelerator. In 1937, he was elected to the Royal Society. When he died he was its longest-serving fellow.

== University of Birmingham ==

Samuel Walter Johnson Smith&#x27;s imminent mandatory retirement at age 65 prompted a search for a new Poynting Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham. The university wanted not just a replacement, but a well-known name, and was willing to spend lavishly in order to build up nuclear physics expertise at Birmingham. Neville Moss, its Professor of Mining Engineering and the Dean of its Faculty of Science approached Oliphant, who presented his terms. In addition to his salary of £1,300 (), he wanted the university to spend £2,000 () to upgrade the laboratory, and another £1,000 per annum () on it. And he did not wish to start until October 1937, to enable him to wrap up his work at the Cavendish Laboratory. Moss agreed to Oliphant&#x27;s terms.

To obtain funding for the cyclotron that he wanted, Oliphant wrote to the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, who was from Birmingham. Chamberlain took up the matter with his friend Lord Nuffield, who provided £60,000 () for the project, enough for the cyclotron, a new building to house it, and a trip to Berkeley, California, so Oliphant could confer with Ernest Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron. Lawrence supported the project, sending Oliphant the plans of the cyclotron that he was constructing at Berkeley, and inviting Oliphant to visit him at the Radiation Laboratory.

Oliphant sailed for New York on 10 December 1938, and met Lawrence in Berkeley. The two men got along very well, dining at &quot;Trader Vic&#x27;s&quot; in Oakland. Oliphant was aware of the problems in building cyclotrons encountered by Chadwick at the University of Liverpool and Cockcroft at the Cavendish Laboratory, and intended to avoid these and get his cyclotron built on time and on budget by following Lawrence&#x27;s specifications as closely as possible. He hoped that it would be running by Christmas 1939, but the outbreak of the Second World War quashed his hopes. The Nuffield Cyclotron would not be completed until after the war.

=== Radar ===

In 1938, Oliphant became involved with the development of radar, then still a secret. While visiting prototype radar stations, he realised that shorter-wavelength radio waves were needed urgently, especially if there was to be any chance of building a radar set small enough to fit into an aircraft. In August 1939, he took a small group to Ventnor, on the Isle of Wight, to examine the Chain Home system first hand. He obtained a grant from the Admiralty to develop radar systems with wavelengths less than ; the best available at the time was .

Oliphant&#x27;s group at Birmingham worked on developing two promising devices, the klystron and the magnetron. Working with James Sayers, Oliphant managed to produce an improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, John Randall and Harry Boot, worked on a radical new design, a cavity magnetron. By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of , just the kind of short wavelengths needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron&#x27;s power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German U-boats, intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.

In 1940, the Fall of France, and the possibility that Britain might be invaded, prompted Oliphant to send his wife and children to Australia. The Fall of Singapore in February 1942 led him to offer his services to John Madsen, the Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Sydney, and the head of the Radiophysics Laboratory at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for developing radar. He embarked from Glasgow for Australia on on 20 March. The voyage, part of a 46-ship convoy, was a slow one, with the convoy frequently zigzagging to avoid U-boats, and the ship did not reach Fremantle until 27 May.

The Australians were already preparing to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin from their work on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin on the process of moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.

=== Manhattan Project ===
At the University of Birmingham in March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls examined the theoretical issues involved in developing, producing and using atomic bombs in a paper that became known as the Frisch–Peierls memorandum. They considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but it might require as little as of uranium-235 to unleash the energy of hundreds of tons of TNT. The first person they showed their paper to was Oliphant, and he immediately took it to Sir Henry Tizard, the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). As a result, a special subcommittee of the CSSAW known as the MAUD Committee was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson, and its original membership included Oliphant, Chadwick, Cockcroft and Moon. In its final report in July 1941, the MAUD Committee concluded that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943.
Great Britain was at war and authorities there thought that the development of an atomic bomb was urgent, but there was much less urgency in the United States. Oliphant was one of the people who pushed the American program into motion. On 5 August 1941, Oliphant flew to the United States in a B-24 Liberator bomber, ostensibly to discuss the radar-development program, but was assigned to find out why the United States was ignoring the findings of the MAUD Committee. He later recalled: &quot;the minutes and reports had been sent to Lyman Briggs, who was the Director of the Uranium Committee, and we were puzzled to receive virtually no comment. I called on Briggs in Washington [DC], only to find out that this inarticulate and unimpressive man had put the reports in his safe and had not shown them to members of his committee. I was amazed and distressed.&quot;

Oliphant then met with the Uranium Committee at its meeting in New York on 26 August 1941. Samuel K. Allison, a new member of the committee, was an experimental physicist and a protégé of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. He recalled that Oliphant &quot;came to a meeting and said &#x27;bomb&#x27; in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb, and said we had no right to work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us.&quot; Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. 

Oliphant then travelled to Berkeley, where he met his friend Lawrence on 23 September, giving him a copy of the Frisch–Peierls memorandum. Lawrence had Robert Oppenheimer check the figures, bringing him into the project for the first time. Oliphant found another ally in Oppenheimer, and he not only managed to convince Lawrence and Oppenheimer that an atomic bomb was feasible, but inspired Lawrence to convert his cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for electromagnetic isotope separation, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. Leo Szilard later wrote, &quot;if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant would be the first to receive one.&quot;
On 26 October 1942, Oliphant embarked from Melbourne, taking Rosa and the children back with him. The wartime sea voyage on the French &quot;Desirade&quot; was again a slow one, and they did not reach Glasgow until 28 February 1943. He had to leave them behind once more in November 1943 after the British Tube Alloys effort was merged with the American Manhattan Project by the Quebec Agreement, and he left for the United States as part of the British Mission. Oliphant was one of the scientists whose services the Americans were most eager to secure. Oppenheimer, who was now the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory attempted to persuade him to join the team there, but Oliphant preferred to head a team assisting his friend Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley to develop the electromagnetic uranium enrichment—a vital but less overtly military part of the project.

Oliphant secured the services of fellow Australian physicist Harrie Massey, who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron. This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant became Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; deputy, and was in charge of the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. Although based in Berkeley, he often visited Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the separation plant was, and was an occasional visitor to Los Alamos. He made efforts to involve Australian scientists in the project, and had Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, release Eric Burhop to work on the Manhattan Project. He briefed Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, on the project, and urged the Australian government to secure Australian uranium deposits.

A meeting with Major General Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, at Berkeley in September 1944, convinced Oliphant that the Americans intended to monopolise nuclear weapons after the war, restricting British research and production to Canada, and not permitting nuclear weapons technology to be shared with Australia. Characteristically, Oliphant bypassed Chadwick, the head of the British Mission, and sent a report direct to Wallace Akers, the head of the Tube Alloys Directorate in London. Akers summoned Oliphant back to London for consultation. En route, Oliphant met with Chadwick and other members of the British Mission in Washington, where the prospect of resuming an independent British project was discussed. Chadwick was adamant that the cooperation with the Americans should continue, and that Oliphant and his team should remain until the task of building an atomic bomb was finished. Akers sent Chadwick a telegram directing that Oliphant should return to the UK by April 1945.

Oliphant returned to England in March 1945, and resumed his post as a professor of physics at the University of Birmingham. He was on holiday in Wales with his family when he first heard of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was later to remark that he felt &quot;sort of proud that the bomb had worked, and absolutely appalled at what it had done to human beings&quot;. Oliphant became a harsh critic of nuclear weapons and a member of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, saying, &quot;I, right from the beginning, have been terribly worried by the existence of nuclear weapons and very much against their use.&quot; His wartime work would have earned him a Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm, but the Australian government vetoed this honour, as government policy at the time was not to confer honours on civilians.

== Later years in Australia ==
In April 1946, the Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, asked Oliphant if he would be a technical advisor to the Australian delegation to the newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC), which was debating international control of nuclear weapons. Oliphant agreed, and joined the Minister for External Affairs, H. V. Evatt and the Australian Representative at the United Nations, Paul Hasluck, to hear the Baruch Plan. The attempt at international control was unsuccessful, and no agreement was reached.

Chifley and the Secretary for Post-War Reconstruction, Dr H. C. &quot;Nugget&quot; Coombs, also discussed with Oliphant a plan to create a new research institute that would attract the world&#x27;s best scholars to Australia and lift the standard of university education nationwide. They hoped to start by attracting three of Australia&#x27;s most distinguished expatriates: Oliphant, Howard Florey and Keith Hancock. It was academic suicide; Australia was far from the centres where the latest research was being carried out, and communications were much poorer at that time. But Oliphant accepted, and in 1950 returned to Australia as the first Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University. 

Within the school he created a Department of Particle Physics, which he headed himself, a Department of Nuclear Physics under Ernest Titterton, a Department of Geophysics under John Jaeger, a Department of Astronomy under Bart Bok, a Department of Theoretical Physics under Kenneth Le Couteur and a Department of Mathematics under Bernhard Neumann.
Oliphant was an advocate of nuclear weapons research. He served on the post-war Technical Committee that advised the British government on nuclear weapons, and publicly declared that Britain needed to develop its own nuclear weapons independent of the United States to &quot;avoid the danger of becoming a lesser power&quot;. 

The establishment of a world-class nuclear physics research capability in Australia was intimately linked with the government&#x27;s plans to develop nuclear power and weapons. Locating the new research institute in Canberra would place it close to the Snowy Mountains Scheme, which was planned to be the centrepiece of a new nuclear power industry. 

Oliphant hoped that Britain would assist with the Australian program, and the British were interested in cooperation because Australia had uranium ore and weapons testing sites, and there were concerns that Australia was becoming too closely aligned with the United States. Arrangements were made for Australian scientists to be seconded to the British Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, but the close cooperation he sought was stymied by security concerns arising from Britain&#x27;s commitments to the United States.

Oliphant envisaged Canberra one day becoming a university town like Oxford or Cambridge. A threat to the future of the university arose in the wake of the 1949 election, when the Liberal Party of Australia led by Robert Menzies won. Many Liberals were opposed to the university, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the Menzies government amalgamated it with the Canberra University College. Henceforth, it would no longer be a research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission, and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities. 

Despite the setbacks, by 2014 the vision of Canberra as a university town would be well on its way to becoming a reality.

In September 1951, Oliphant applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a nuclear physics conference in Chicago. The visa was not refused, nor was Oliphant accused of subversive activities, but neither was it issued. This was the height of the Red Scare. The American McCarran Act restricted travel to the United States, and in Australia the Menzies government was attempting to ban the Communist Party, and was not inclined to support Oliphant against the American government. A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the United States Department of State. Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US, he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation. The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, nor was he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US.

In 1955, Oliphant initiated the design and construction of a 500 megajoule homopolar generator (HPG), the world&#x27;s largest. This massive machine contained three discs in diameter and weighing . He obtained £40,000 () initial funding from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Completed in 1963, the HPG was intended to be the power source for a synchrotron, but this was not built. Instead, it was used to power the LT-4 Tokamak and a large-scale railgun that was used as a scientific instrument for experiments with plasma physics. It was decommissioned in 1985.

Oliphant founded the Australian Academy of Science in 1954, teaming up with David Martyn to overcome the obstacles that had frustrated previous attempts. Oliphant was its president until 1956. Deciding that the Academy of Science should have its own special building, Oliphant raised the required money from donations. As chairman of the Building Design Committee, he selected and oversaw the construction of one of Canberra&#x27;s most striking architectural designs. He also delivered the Academy of Science&#x27;s 1961 Matthew Flinders Lecture, on the subject of &quot;Faraday in his time and today&quot;.

Oliphant retired as Professor of Particle Physics in 1964, and was appointed Professor of Ionised Gases. In this chair he produced his first research papers since the 1930s. He was appointed Professor Emeritus in 1967. He was invited by the premier, Don Dunstan, to become the Governor of South Australia, a position he held from 1971 to 1976. During this period, he caused great concern to Dunstan when he strongly supported the decision of the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. He assisted in the founding of the Australian Democrats political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977 at which the party was launched.

&quot;The Age&quot; reported in 1981 that &quot;Sir Mark Oliphant warned the Dunstan Government of the &#x27;grave dangers&#x27; of appointing an Australian Aborigine, Sir Douglas Nicholls, to succeed him as South Australia&#x27;s Governor&quot;. Oliphant had secretly written, &quot;[t]here is something inherent in the personality of the Aborigine which makes it difficult for him to adapt fully to the ways of the white man.&quot; The authors of Oliphant&#x27;s biography noted that &quot;that was the prevailing attitude of almost the entire white population of Australia until well after World War II&quot;.

Oliphant was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1959, and was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1977 &quot;for eminent achievement and merit of the highest degree in the field of public service and in service to the crown&quot;.

Late in life, Oliphant watched his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. 

==Death==
On 14 July 2000, he died in Canberra, at the age of 98. His body was cremated. His daughter Vivian died from a brain tumour in 2008, after his son Michael died from colon cancer in 1971.

== Legacy ==

Places and things named in honour of Oliphant include the Oliphant Building at the Australian National University, the Mark Oliphant Conservation Park, a South Australian high schools science competition, the Oliphant Wing of the Physics Building at the University of Adelaide, a school in the Adelaide suburb of Munno Para West, and a bridge on Parkes Way in Canberra near his old laboratory at the ANU. 

His papers are in the Adolph Basser Library at the Australian Academy of Science, and the Barr Smith Library at the University of Adelaide. Oliphant&#x27;s nephew, Pat Oliphant, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist. His daughter-in-law, Monica Oliphant, is a distinguished Australian physicist specialising in the field of renewable energy, for which she was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2015.

<doc id="315712" wikidata="Q1840570" url="?curid=315712" title="Governor of South Australia">
<text>The governor of South Australia is the representative in South Australia of the monarch, currently King Charles III. The governor performs the same constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level as does the governor-general of Australia at the national level. In accordance with the conventions of the Westminster system of parliamentary government, the governor nearly always acts solely on the advice of the head of the elected government, the premier of South Australia. Nevertheless, the governor retains the reserve powers of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the premier. As from June 2014, Queen Elizabeth II, upon the recommendation of the premier, accorded all current, future and living former governors the title &#x27;The Honourable&#x27; for life. The first six governors oversaw the colony from proclamation in 1836, until self-government and an elected Parliament of South Australia was granted in the year prior to the inaugural 1857 election.

The first Australian-born governor of South Australia was Major-General Sir James Harrison (appointed 1968), and most subsequent governors have been Australian-born. The first South Australian-born governor was Sir Mark Oliphant (appointed 1971), and the first Aboriginal governor was Sir Douglas Nicholls (appointed 1976). 

The current governor is diplomat Frances Adamson who was sworn in at Government House, Adelaide on 7 October 2021, replacing Hieu Van Le, who held the role from 2014 to 2021. 

The governor&#x27;s official residence is Government House, in Adelaide, the state&#x27;s capital.

== Role ==
Prior to self-government, the governor was responsible to the Government of the United Kingdom and was charged with implementing laws and policy. Currently, the governor is responsible for safeguarding the South Australian Constitution and facilitating the work of the Parliament and state government.

The governor exercises power on the advice of ministers, conveyed through the Executive Council. Constitutional powers bestowed upon the governor and used with the consent and advice of the Executive Council include:

* to appoint and dismiss ministers.
* exercising the prerogative of mercy.
* issuing regulations and proclamations under existing laws.
* giving royal assent to bills passed by Parliament.
* appointing judges, royal commissioners and senior public servants.
* dissolving Parliament and issuing writs for elections.

The governor additionally maintains &#x27;reserve powers&#x27; which can be used without the consent of the Executive Council. These powers relate to the appointment and dismissal of ministers and Parliament.

==Governor&#x27;s standard==
The governor standard of South Australia is the same design as the British blue ensign with the Union Flag at the upper left quarter. On the right side, the State Badge of South Australia, comprising a piping shrike in a golden disc, is surmounted by a crown. In 2024, this representation changed from a St Edward&#x27;s Crown to a Tudor Crown. 

If the standard is flying at Government House, on a vehicle or at an event, this indicates that the governor is present.

==Governor&#x27;s awards and commendations==
===Awards===
The governor of South Australia supports outstanding achievers within the South Australian community through the presentation of a number of annual awards:
*The Governor&#x27;s Multicultural Awards recognise and celebrate South Australians who promote multiculturalism and increase the understanding of the benefits of cultural diversity in our community; administered by the Department of the premier and Cabinet through Multicultural Affairs. They are presented by the governor on the advice of an independent judging panel.
*The Governor&#x27;s Aboriginal Youth Awards recognise young Aboriginal South Australians, aged between 15 and 29 years, who are showing potential and determination to achieve success, or who are excelling in their chosen field in one of three areas: Sport, Arts and Higher Education; delivered through a partnership between the Department of the Premier and Cabinet’s Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation division and the Office of the Governor.
*The Governor’s Civics Awards for Schools provide the opportunity for young South Australians to develop their understanding of the role citizenship plays in a multicultural and democratic society. The inaugural awards in 2019 had two categories: an individual and a group award for Year 5 students; in 2020, they expanded to include students from Years 5–12.

===Commendations===
The governor also awards a series of commendations for excellence in the SACE year 12 exams, including:
*Governor of South Australia Commendation – Excellence Award
*Governor of South Australia Commendation – Aboriginal Student SACE Excellence Award
*Governor of South Australia Commendation – Excellence in Modified SACE Award.

<doc id="315718" wikidata="Q5013581" url="?curid=315718" title="CP-67">
<text>CP-67 is a hypervisor, or Virtual Machine Monitor, from IBM for its System/360 Model 67 computer.

CP-67 is the control program portion of CP/CMS, a virtual machine operating system developed by IBM&#x27;s Cambridge Scientific Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was a reimplementation of their earlier research system CP-40, which ran on a one-off customized S/360-40. CP-67 was later reimplemented (again) as CP-370, which IBM released as VM/370 in 1972, when virtual memory was added to the System/370 series.

CP and CMS are usually grouped together as a unit, but the &quot;components are independent of each other. CP-67 can be used on an appropriate configuration without CMS, and CMS
can be run on a properly configured System/360 as a single-user system without CP-67.&quot; 

==Minimum hardware configuration==
The minimum configuation for CP-67 is:
* 2067 CPU, model 1 or 2
* 2365 Processor Storage model 1—262,144 bytes of magnetic core memory with an access time of 750 ns (nanoseconds) per eight bytes.
* IBM 1052 printer/keyboard
* IBM 1403 printer
* IBM 2540 card read/punch
* Three IBM 2311 disk storage units, 7.5 MB each, 22.5 MB total
* IBM 2400 magnetic tape data storage unit
* IBM 270x Transmission Control unit

==Installation==
Disks to be used by CP have to be formatted by a standalone utility called &quot;FORMAT&quot;, loaded from tape or punched cards. CP disks are formatted with fixed-length 829 byte records. 

Following formatting, a second stand-alone utility, &quot;DIRECT&quot;, partitions the disk space between permanent (system and user files) and temporary (paging and spooling) space. DIRECT also creates the user directory identifying the virtual machines (users) available in the system. For each user the directory contains identifying information, id and password, and lists the resources (core, devices, etc) that this user can access, Although a user may be allowed access to physical devices it is more common to specify virtual devices, such as a spooled card reader, card punch, and printer. A user can be allocated one or more virtual disk units, &quot;mini disks&quot; [sic.], which resemble a real disk of the same device type, except that they occupy a subset of the space on the real device.

<text>The cockatiel (; Nymphicus hollandicus), also known as the weero/weiro or quarrion, is a medium-sized
parrot that is a member of its own branch of the cockatoo family endemic to Australia. They are prized as exotic household pets and companion parrots throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed compared to other parrots. As a caged bird, cockatiels are second in popularity only to the budgerigar.
The cockatiel is the only member of the genus &quot;Nymphicus&quot;. It was previously unclear whether the cockatiel is a crested parakeet or small cockatoo; however, more recent molecular studies have assigned it to its own subfamily, Nymphicinae. It is, therefore, now classified as the smallest subfamily of the Cacatuidae (cockatoo family). Cockatiels are native to Australia, favouring the Australian wetlands, scrublands, and bushlands. There are many different mutations of this bird.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==

Originally described by Scottish writer and naturalist Robert Kerr in 1793 as &quot;Psittacus hollandicus&quot;, the cockatiel (or cockateel) was moved to its own genus, &quot;Nymphicus&quot;, by Wagler in 1832. Its genus name reflects the experience of one of the earliest groups of Europeans to see the birds in their native habitat; the travellers thought the birds were so beautiful that they named them after mythical nymphs. The specific name &quot;hollandicus&quot; refers to New Holland, a historical name for Australia.

Its biological relationships were for a long time uncertain; it is now placed in a monotypic subfamily Nymphicinae, but was sometimes in the past classified among the Platycercinae, the broad-tailed parrots. This issue was settled with molecular studies. A 1984 study of protein allozymes signalled its closer relationship to cockatoos than to other parrots, and mitochondrial 12S rRNA sequence data places it among the Calyptorhynchinae (dark cockatoos) subfamily. The unique, parakeet (meaning long-tailed parrot) morphological feature is a consequence of the decrease in size and accompanying change of ecological niche.

Sequence analysis of intron 7 of the nuclear &quot;β&quot;-fibrinogen gene, on the other hand, indicates that it may yet be distinct enough as to warrant recognition of the Nymphicinae rather than inclusion of the genus in the Calyptorhynchinae.

The cockatiel is now biologically classified as a genuine member of Cacatuidae on account of sharing all of the cockatoo family&#x27;s biological features, namely, the erectile crest, a gallbladder, powder down, suppressed cloudy-layer (which precludes the display of blue and green structural colours), and facial feathers covering the sides of the beak, all of which are rarely found outside the family Cacatuidae. This biological relation to other cockatoos is further supported by the existence of at least one documented case of a successful hybrid between a cockatiel and a galah, another cockatoo species.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Cockatiels are native to Australia, where they are found largely in arid or semi-arid country but always close to water. Largely nomadic, the species will move to where food and water is available. They are typically seen in pairs or small flocks. Sometimes, hundreds will flock around a single body of water. Wild cockatiels typically eat seeds, particularly &quot;Acacia&quot;, wheat, sunflower and &quot;Sorghum&quot;. To many farmers&#x27; dismay, they often eat cultivated crops. Cockatiels may be observed in and around western New South Wales and Queensland, Alice Springs, The Kimberley region and the northwestern corner of Western Australia. They are absent from the most fertile southwest and southeast corners of the country, the deepest Western Australian deserts, and Cape York Peninsula.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===

The cockatiel&#x27;s distinctive crest expresses the animal&#x27;s emotional state. The crest is dramatically vertical when the cockatiel is startled or excited, gently oblique in its neutral or relaxed state, and flattened close to the head when the animal is angry or defensive. The crest is also held flat but protrudes outward in the back when the cockatiel is trying to appear alluring or flirtatious. When the cockatiel is tired, the crest is seen positioned halfway upwards, with the tip of the crest usually curling upward. In contrast to most cockatoos, the cockatiel has long tail feathers roughly making up half of its total length. At , the cockatiel is the smallest of the cockatoos, which are generally larger at between .
The &quot;normal grey&quot; or &quot;wild-type&quot; cockatiel&#x27;s plumage is primarily grey with prominent white flashes on the outer edges of each wing. The face of the male is yellow or white, while the face of the female is primarily grey or light grey, and both sexes feature a round orange area on both ears, often referred to as &quot;cheddar cheeks&quot;. This orange colouration is generally vibrant in adult males, and often quite muted in females. Visual sexing is often possible with this variant of the bird.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
Most wild cockatiel chicks and juveniles look female, and are virtually indistinguishable from the time of hatching until their first moulting. They display horizontal yellow stripes or bars on the ventral surface of their tail feathers, yellow spots on the ventral surface of the primary flight feathers of their wings, a grey coloured crest and face, and a dull orange patch on each of their cheeks. However some modern-day mutations are sex linked and the male and female chicks are easily distinguishable as soon as their feathers come in.

Adult cockatiels with common coloring (grey body with yellow head) are sexually dimorphic, though to a lesser degree than many other avian species. This is only evident after the first moulting, typically occurring about six to nine months after hatching: the male loses the white or yellow barring and spots on the underside of his tail feathers and wings. The grey feathers on his cheeks and crest are replaced by bright yellow feathers, while the orange cheek patch becomes brighter and more distinct. The face and crest of the female will typically remain mostly grey with a yellowish tint, and a less vibrant orange cheek patch. Additionally, the female commonly retains the horizontal barring on the underside of her tail feathers.

The colour in cockatiels is derived from two pigments: melanin (which provides the grey colour in the feathers, eyes, beak, and feet), and psittacofulvins (which provide the yellow colour on the face and tail and the orange colour of the cheek patch). The grey colour of the melanin overrides the yellow and orange of the psittacofulvins when both are present.

The melanin content decreases in the face of the males as they mature, allowing the yellow and orange psittacofulvins to be more visible, while an increase in melanin content in the tail causes the disappearance of the horizontal yellow tail bars.

In addition to these visible characteristics, the vocalisation of adult males is typically louder and more complex than that of females. But like most things this is not a hard and fast rule.

=== Colour mutations ===

Worldwide there are currently 22 cockatiel colour mutations established in aviculture, of which eight are exclusive to Australia. Mutations in captivity have emerged in various colours, some quite different from those observed in nature. Wild cockatiels are grey with visible differences between males and females. Male grey cockatiels typically have yellow heads while the female has a grey head. Juveniles tend to look like females with pinker beaks. The pied mutation first appeared in California in 1949. This mutation is a blotch of colour on an otherwise solid-coloured bird. For example, this may appear as a grey blotch on a yellow cockatiel.

Lutino colouration was first seen in 1958. These birds lack the grey of their wild counterparts and are white to soft yellow. This is a popular colour; due to inbreeding, these cockatiels often have a small bald patch behind their crests. The cinnamon mutation, first seen in the 1950s, is very similar in appearance to the grey; however, these birds have a warmer, browner colouring. Pearling was first seen in 1967. This is seen as a feather of one colour with a different coloured edge, such as grey feathers with yellow tips. This distinctive pattern is on a bird&#x27;s wings or back. The albino colour mutation is a lack of pigment. These birds are white with red eyes. Fallow cockatiels first appeared sometime in the 1970s. This mutation shows as a bird with cinnamon colouring with yellow sections. Other mutations include emerald/olive, dominant and recessive silver, and mutations exclusive to Australia: Australian fallow, faded (west coast silver), dilute/pastel silver (east coast silver), silver spangle (edged dilute), platinum, suffused (Australian olive), and pewter. Other mutations, such as face altering mutations, include whiteface, , dominant yellow cheek, sex-linked yellow cheek, gold cheek, cream face, and the Australian yellow cheek.

Cockatiel colour mutations can become even more complex as one bird can have multiple colour mutations. For example, a yellow lutino cockatiel may have pearling – white spots on its back and wings. This is a double mutation. An example of a quadruple mutation would be cinnamon cockatiel with yellowface colouring with pearling and pied markings.

=== Breeding and life span ===
Breeding is triggered by seasonal rainfall. Cockatiels nest in tree hollows near a source of fresh water, often choosing eucalyptus/gum trees. The hen lays 4-7 eggs, one every other day, which she incubates for 17–23 days. The chicks fledge after 5 weeks. Cockatiels are the only cockatoo species which may reproduce by the end of their first year.

The cockatiel&#x27;s average life span is 12 to 15 years, though in captivity and under appropriate living conditions, a cockatiel could be expected to live from 16 to 25 years. The oldest living and confirmed specimen of cockatiel was reportedly 36 years old.

== Speech and vocalization ==
Cockatiels can be very vocal and learn many spoken words and phrases by mimicking. Usually, males are faster to learn speech, mimicking or singing; their calls are also more varied.

Cockatiels can also be taught to sing specific melodies, to the extent that some cockatiels have been demonstrated to synchronise their melodies with the songs of humans. Without being taught how to both male and female cockatiels repeat household sounds, including alarm clocks, phones, tunes or other birds from the outdoors.

<doc id="315739" wikidata="Q3229639" url="?curid=315739" title="Leon Jaworski">
<text>Leonidas &quot;Leon&quot; Jaworski (September 19, 1905 – December 9, 1982) was an American attorney and law professor who served as the second special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal. He was appointed to that position on November 1, 1973, soon after the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre&quot; of October 19–20, 1973, which included the dismissal of his predecessor Archibald Cox.

==Background==
Jaworski was born in Waco in central Texas. His mother, Marie (Mira), was an Austrian immigrant, and his father, Joseph Jaworski, was a Polish immigrant who was an evangelical minister. He was named after ancient Spartan king Leonidas, and had a brother named Hannibal. An earnest student who studied at night by the light of oil lamps, he was a champion debater at Waco High School, graduated from Baylor Law School, and received his master&#x27;s degree in law at the George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C.

== Legal career==
In 1925, he became the youngest person ever admitted to the Texas bar. After starting out defending bootleggers during Prohibition, in 1931, he joined the Houston law firm that became Fulbright &amp; Jaworski, one of the largest law firms in the United States. Jaworski served as president of both the Texas Bar Association (1962–1963) and the American Bar Association (1971–1972) prior to his appointment as Special Prosecutor. He was also President of the Houston Chamber of Commerce in 1960 and served on many corporate and civic boards. Jaworski served in the United States Army and served in the judge advocate office. He rose to the rank of colonel.

In 1964, Jaworski attended hearings of the Warren Commission regarding the assassination of President Kennedy as Special Counsel to the Attorney General of Texas.

== World War II ==
During World War II, Jaworski served in the United States Army&#x27;s judge advocate general&#x27;s office, reaching the rank of colonel. He led the prosecution in multiple cases, including the Johannes Kunze murder trial, where five German prisoners of war were accused of beating a fellow prisoner to death for being a &quot;traitor&quot;.

===Fort Lawton court-martial===

On the night of August 14, 1944, the Fort Lawton riot between African-American U.S. soldiers and Italian prisoners of war at Fort Lawton near Seattle resulted in the lynching of Italian POW Guglielmo Olivotto. Thereafter, Jaworski prosecuted forty-three African-American soldiers, of whom twenty-eight were convicted, in what was the longest U.S. Army court-martial of World War II. In 2007 the U.S. Army Board for Correction of Military Records ordered all those convictions reversed on the grounds that Jaworski had committed &quot;egregious error&quot;.

===War crimes prosecutor===
After the war, Jaworski served as a war crimes prosecutor in Germany. He was involved in a case where eleven German civilians were accused of murdering six American airmen forced down over Germany in the Rüsselsheim massacre, and a case involving people who were complicit in mass murder at the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre. However, Jaworski declined to participate in the Nuremberg Trials on the grounds that the prosecution there was based on laws that did not exist at the time of the culpable acts.

== Political connections ==
A Democrat, Jaworski was a friend of fellow Texan Lyndon B. Johnson, whom he successfully represented in a 1960 lawsuit filed to prevent Johnson from campaigning for the U.S. Senate against Republican John Tower at the same time that Johnson was running for Vice President of the United States on the John F. Kennedy ticket. However, Jaworski did not always support Democratic candidates. He supported Richard Nixon and voted for him twice, contributed to George H. W. Bush in his campaign for the presidency in 1980, and after Bush conceded the nomination he became treasurer of &quot;Democrats for Reagan&quot; during the 1980 general election campaign.

Having been convinced of his integrity, in 1980, Jaworski aided former Nixon staffer Egil &quot;Bud&quot; Krogh, whom he had sent to prison in 1973, in Krogh&#x27;s request to be reinstated to the bar in Washington state.

== Watergate ==
On November 1, 1973, Jaworski became the Special Prosecutor in the Watergate scandal, assuming leadership of a protracted contest with President Nixon to secure evidence for the trial of former senior administration officials on charges relating to the Watergate scandal.

Jaworski&#x27;s predecessor as Special Prosecutor, Archibald Cox, initially believed that only Nixon&#x27;s aides had committed misconduct. Because of testimony from Nixon&#x27;s deputy assistant Alexander Butterfield, Cox learned that Nixon had discussed the Watergate cover-up with the accused on numerous occasions and that these conversations had been recorded by the White House taping system. This discovery caused Cox to subpoena tapes of several presidential conversations as evidence for the upcoming criminal trial, but Nixon refused to release them, citing executive privilege.

Nixon offered Cox what became known as the Stennis Compromise: instead of supplying the tapes, he would supply Cox with transcripts of the recordings, subject to Nixon&#x27;s discretion, and allow one senator to listen to the recordings and verify the transcripts&#x27; accuracy. Cox rejected the compromise, whereupon Nixon orchestrated the firing of Cox in the (widely called, but informally named) Saturday Night Massacre using Acting Attorney General Robert Bork.

On November 1, 1973, Bork announced he selected, and Nixon approved, Jaworski to replace Cox. Jaworski subsequently subpoenaed sixty-four taped conversations. Nixon appealed on two grounds: first, that the office of Special Prosecutor did not have the right to sue the office of President; and second, that the requested materials were privileged presidential conversations. Aware that an important constitutional issue was at stake, and unwilling to wait any longer, Jaworski asked the Supreme Court to take the case directly, bypassing the Court of Appeals.

On July 24, 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that the Special Prosecutor did have the right to sue the President; and that the &quot;generalized assertion of [executive] privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial&quot;. Nixon was forced to give the unedited tapes to Jaworski, including the so-called Smoking Gun Tape which included a compromising discussion of June 23, 1972. The President&#x27;s remaining support waned, and he resigned on August 9, 1974.

In the summer of 1982, seven members of the grand jury choose to break their oath of silence because &quot;they [were] convinced justice was not done&quot; and discussed their 30-month service with the ABC news show &quot;20/20&quot;. They stated they wanted to bring an indictment against Pres. Nixon after hearing the batch of tapes released the Summer of 1974. One grand juror stated that in a straw vote, &quot;There were 19 people in the grand-jury room that particular day, and we all raised our hands about wanting an indictment—all of us. And some of us raised both hands.&quot; However, Jaworski did not favor an indictment, even going so far as saying he would not sign one. In discussions with the grand jury, Jaworski cited &quot;the trauma of the country&quot;, and prior to Nixon&#x27;s resignation, the lack of precedent for indicting a sitting president.

==Later years==
Jaworski resigned as special prosecutor on October 25, 1974, once the cover-up trial had begun, and a new special prosecutor was appointed. Jaworski was a close friend of Dean Ernest Raba of St. Mary&#x27;s University School of Law in San Antonio, where he taught as an adjunct professor for several years.

In 1977, Jaworski reluctantly agreed to serve as special counsel to a House Ethics Committee investigation to determine whether members had indirectly or directly accepted anything of value from the government of the Republic of Korea. The investigation, known as Koreagate or the Tongsun Park investigation, potentially involved hundreds of members of Congress and their families and associates, and included charges of bribery and influence-peddling via envelopes stuffed with $100 bills.

Jaworski died on December 9, 1982, while chopping wood at the Circle J Ranch near Wimberley in Hays County, Texas. His wife died in 1999. His son, Joseph Jaworski, is a former lawyer turned best-selling author and leadership expert. His grandson is political journalist and author Robert Draper. His other grandson is Joe Jaworski, a former mayor of Galveston who ran in 2022 for Texas Attorney General.

==Awards and honors==
In 1971, Jaworski received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1988, the HBAA Leon Jaworski Award was initiated to honor a lawyer for a lifetime of volunteer service. State and national bar associations reward professional achievement; the granting of the Jaworski Award is based solely on service to the greater Houston community. The award is named for Leon Jaworski whose life and achievements reflected a deep commitment to public service.

<text>Sir Joseph Rotblat (4 November 1908 – 31 August 2005) was a Polish and British physicist. During World War II he worked on Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project, but left the Los Alamos Laboratory on grounds of conscience after it became clear to him in 1944 that Germany had ceased development of an atomic bomb.

His work on nuclear fallout was a major contribution toward the ratification of the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. A signatory of the 1955 Russell–Einstein Manifesto, he was secretary-general of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from their founding until 1973 and shared, with the Pugwash Conferences, the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.&quot;

== Early life ==
Józef Rotblat was born on 4 November 1908 to a Polish-Jewish family in Warsaw, then part of the Russian-ruled Kingdom of Poland, better known as Congress Poland. He was one of seven children, two of whom died in infancy. His father, Zygmunt Rotblat, built up and ran a nationwide horse-drawn carriage business, owned land and bred horses. Józef&#x27;s early years were spent in what was a prosperous household but circumstances changed at the outbreak of World War I. Borders were closed and the family&#x27;s horses were requisitioned, leading to the failure of the business and poverty for their family. Despite having a religious background, by the age of ten, he doubted the existence of God, and later became an agnostic.

Rotblat&#x27;s parents could not afford to send him to a gymnasium, so Rotblat received his secondary education in a &quot;cheder&quot; taught by a local rabbi. He then attended a technical school, where he studied electrical engineering, graduating with his diploma in 1923 in the newly established Republic of Poland. After graduating, Rotblat worked as an electrician in Warsaw, but had an ambition to become a physicist. He sat the entrance examinations of the Free University of Poland in January 1929, and passed the physics one with ease, but was less successful in writing a paper about the Commission of National Education, a subject about which he knew nothing. He was then interviewed by , the Dean of the Science Faculty. Wertenstein had studied in Paris under Marie Curie and at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford. Wertenstein offered Rotblat a place.

Rotblat earned a Master of Arts at the Free University in 1932. After, he entered the University of Warsaw, and became a Doctor of Physics in 1938. He held the position of Research Fellow in the Radiological Laboratory of the Scientific Society of Warsaw, of which Wertenstein was the director, and became assistant Director of the Atomic Physics Institute of the Free University of Poland in 1938.

==Marriage and early physics work==
During this period, Rotblat married a literature student, Tola Gryn, whom he had met at a student summer camp in 1930.

Before the outbreak of World War II, he conducted experiments that showed that in the fission process, neutrons were emitted. In early 1939, he envisaged that a large number of fissions could occur and if this happened within a sufficiently short time, then considerable amounts of energy could be released. He went on to calculate that this process could occur in less than a microsecond, and as a consequence would result in an explosion.

In 1939, through Wertenstein&#x27;s connections, Rotblat was invited to study in Paris and at the University of Liverpool under James Chadwick, winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize for discovering the neutron. Chadwick was building a particle accelerator called a &quot;cyclotron&quot; to study fundamental nuclear reactions, and Rotblat wanted to build a similar machine in Warsaw, so he decided to join Chadwick in Liverpool. He travelled to England alone because he could not afford to support his wife there.

Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a fellowship (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, and in that summer of 1939, the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When the time came to leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; however, the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she was murdered in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply for the rest of his life, and he never remarried.

== Manhattan Project ==
While still in Poland, Rotblat had realised that nuclear fission might possibly be used to produce an atomic bomb. He first thought that he should &quot;put the whole thing out of my mind&quot;, but he continued because he thought the only way to prevent Nazi Germany from using a nuclear bomb was if Britain had one to act as a deterrent. He worked with Chadwick on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project.

In February 1944, Rotblat joined the Los Alamos Laboratory as part of Chadwick&#x27;s British Mission to the Manhattan Project. Although he was upset by the morality of the project, he believed the allies needed to be able to threaten retaliation in case Germany developed the bomb. The usual condition for people to work on the Manhattan Project was that they had to become US citizens or British subjects. Rotblat declined, and the condition was waived. At Los Alamos, he was befriended by Stan Ulam, a fellow Polish-Jewish scientist, with whom he was able to converse in Polish. Rotblat worked in Egon Bretscher&#x27;s group, investigating whether high-energy gamma rays produced by nuclear fission would interfere with the nuclear chain reaction process, and then with Robert R. Wilson&#x27;s cyclotron group.

Rotblat continued to have strong reservations about the use of science to develop such a devastating weapon. In 1985, he related that, at a private dinner at the Chadwicks&#x27; house at Los Alamos in March 1944, he was shocked to hear the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., say words to the effect that the real purpose in making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Indeed, Groves testified under oath at the 1954 hearing about J. Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s security record that &quot;there was never, from about two weeks from the time I took charge of this project, any illusion on my part but that Russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis.&quot; Despite Groves&#x27; testimony, in response to a suggestion by Andrew Brown that Groves&#x27; remark may have been made to test Rotblat&#x27;s loyalty, Barton Bernstein, who had questioned the accuracy of Rotblat&#x27;s memory, commented in a letter to Brown: &quot;It&#x27;s an interesting, responsible interpretation, and cannot be dismissed, though I&#x27;m not prepared to embrace it.&quot;

By the end of 1944, it was also apparent that Germany had abandoned the development of its own bomb in 1942. Rotblat then asked to leave the project on grounds of conscience and returned to Liverpool.

Chadwick learned that the chief of security held a security dossier in which Rotblat was accused of intending to return to England so that he could be flown over Poland and parachute into Soviet territory to pass on the secrets of the atomic bomb. He was also accused of visiting someone in Santa Fe and leaving them a blank cheque to finance the formation of a communist cell.

Rotblat was able to show that much of the information within the dossier had been fabricated. In addition, FBI records show that in 1950, Rotblat&#x27;s friend in Santa Fe was tracked down in California, and she flatly denied the story; the cheque had never been cashed and had been left to pay for items not available in the UK during the war. In 1985, Rotblat recounted how a box containing &quot;all my documents&quot; went missing on a train ride from Washington D.C. to New York as he was leaving the country, but the presence of large numbers of Rotblat&#x27;s personal papers from Los Alamos now archived at the Churchill Archives Centre &quot;is totally at odds with Rotblat&#x27;s account of events&quot;.

== Nuclear fallout ==
Rotblat returned to Britain to become senior lecturer and acting director of research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. He was naturalised as a British subject on 8 January 1946. Most of his family had survived the war. With the help of a Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczysław (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat&#x27;s sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage of the fact that she was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled the rest of the family out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat&#x27;s brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael&#x27;s wife Manya, Rotblat&#x27;s mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick&#x27;s offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford, and University College London, and become an editor of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan, and gave a series of public lectures in which he called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research. Rotblat was determined that his research should have only peaceful ends, and so became interested in the medical and biological uses of radiation. In 1949, he became Professor of Physics at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital (&quot;Barts&quot;), London, a teaching hospital associated with the University of London. He remained there for the rest of his career, becoming a professor emeritus in 1976. He received his PhD from Liverpool in 1950, having written his thesis on the &quot;Determination of a number of neutrons emitted from a source&quot;. He also worked on several official bodies connected with nuclear physics, and arranged the &quot;Atom Train&quot;, a major travelling exhibition for schools on civil nuclear energy.

At St Bartholomew&#x27;s, Rotblat worked on the effects of radiation on living organisms, especially on ageing and fertility. This led him to an interest in nuclear fallout, especially strontium-90 and the safe limits of ionising radiation. In 1955, he demonstrated that the contamination caused by the fallout after the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll by the United States had been far greater than that stated officially. Until then the official line had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released. Japanese scientists who had collected data from a fishing vessel, the &quot;Lucky Dragon&quot;, which had inadvertently been exposed to fallout, disagreed with this. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase at the end of the explosion increased the amount of radioactivity by forty times. His paper was taken up by the media and contributed to the public debate that resulted in the ending of atmospheric tests by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

== Peace work ==
Rotblat believed that scientists should always be concerned with the ethical consequences of their work. He became one of the most prominent critics of the nuclear arms race, was the youngest signatory of the Russell–Einstein Manifesto in 1955, and chaired the press conference that launched it. After the positive coverage of the manifesto, Cyrus Eaton offered to fund the influential Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, an international organisation that brought together scholars and public figures to work toward reducing the danger of armed conflict and to seek solutions to global security threats, particularly those related to nuclear warfare. With Bertrand Russell and others, Rotblat organised the first of these in 1957 and continued to work within their framework until his death. In 1958, Rotblat joined the executive committee of the newly launched Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Despite the Iron Curtain and the Cold War, he advocated establishing links between scientists from the West and East. For this reason, the Pugwash conferences were viewed with suspicion. Initially the British government thought them little more than &quot;Communist front gatherings&quot;.

However, he persuaded John Cockcroft, a member of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, to suggest who might be invited to the 1958 conference. He successfully resisted a subsequent attempt to take over the conferences, causing a Foreign Office official to write that &quot;the difficulty is to get Prof. Rotblat to pay any attention to what we think ... He is no doubt jealous of his independence and scientific integrity&quot;, and that securing &quot;a new organizer for the British delegation seems to be the first need, but I do not know if there is any hope of this.&quot; By the early 1960s the Ministry of Defence thought that the Pugwash Conferences were &quot;now a very respectable organization&quot;, and the Foreign Office stated that it had &quot;official blessing&quot; and that any breakthrough may well originate at such gatherings. The Pugwash Conferences are credited with laying the ground work for the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 and the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. In parallel with the Pugwash Conferences, he joined with Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, Bertrand Russell and other concerned scientists to found the World Academy of Art and Science, which was proposed by them in the mid-1950s and formally constituted in 1960.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Later life ==
Rotblat retired from St Bartholomew&#x27;s in 1976. In 1975 and 1976, he was Montague Visiting Professor of International Relations at the University of Edinburgh. He believed that scientists have an individual moral responsibility and, just as the Hippocratic Oath provides a code of conduct for physicians, he thought that scientists should have their own code of moral conduct, a Hippocratic Oath for scientists. During his tenure as president of the Pugwash conferences, Rotblat nominated Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu for the Nobel Peace Prize every year from 1988 to 2004. Vanunu had disclosed the extent of Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme and consequently spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.

Rotblat campaigned ceaselessly against nuclear weapons. In an interview shortly before the 2004 US presidential election, he expressed his belief that the Russell–Einstein Manifesto still had &quot;great relevance today, after 50 years, particularly in connection with the election of a president in the United States&quot;, and above all, with respect to the potential pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons. Central to his view of the world were the words of the Russell–Einstein Manifesto with which he concluded his acceptance lecture for the Nobel Prize in 1995: &quot;Above all, remember your humanity&quot;. He also served as editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Physics in Medicine and Biology&quot; from 1960 to 1972. He was the president of several institutions and professional associations and also a co-founder and member of the governing board of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, as well as a member of the Advisory Committee on Medical Research of the World Health Organization. Rotblat was a programme advisor to the BAFTA award-winning nuclear docudrama &quot;Threads&quot;, produced in 1984.

Rotblat suffered a stroke in 2004, and his health declined. He died of septicaemia at the Royal Free Hospital in Camden, London, on 31 August 2005.

== Awards and honours ==
Rotblat was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1965 New Year Honours. He won the Albert Einstein Peace Prize in 1992, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1995. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1998 Birthday Honours for services to international understanding. His certificate of election to the Royal Society read 
Rotblat shared, with the Pugwash Conferences, the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize for efforts toward nuclear disarmament. His citation read: &quot;for efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.&quot; Towards the end of his life, he was also elected honorary member of the International Association of Physics Students, and the Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation of India awarded him the Jamnalal Bajaj Award in 1999.
He was an honorary editorial board member for ‘Journal of Environment Peace’ published from the library of University of Toronto, now from Noble International University, edited by Professor Bob Ganguly and Professor Roger Hansell.

A plaque commemorating Joseph Rotblat, unveiled in 2017 in the presence of Polish Ambassador Arkady Rzegocki, can be found outside the offices of British Pugwash, on the corner of Bury Place and Great Russell Street in London.

<text>In baseball statistics, a relief pitcher is credited with a game finished (denoted by GF) if he is the last pitcher to pitch for his team in a game. A starting pitcher is not credited with a GF for pitching a complete game. 

Mariano Rivera is the all-time leader in games finished with 952. Rivera is the only pitcher in MLB history to finish more than 900 career games. Trevor Hoffman and Lee Smith are the only other pitchers to finish more than 800 games in their careers.

<doc id="315776" wikidata="Q477108" url="?curid=315776" title="Constitution of India">
<text>The Constitution of India is the supreme legal document of India, and the longest written national constitution in the world. The document lays down the framework that demarcates fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. 

It espouses constitutional supremacy (not parliamentary supremacy found in the United Kingdom, since it was created by a constituent assembly rather than Parliament) and was adopted with a declaration in its preamble. Although the Indian Constitution does not contain a provision to limit the powers of the parliament to amend the constitution, The Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala held that there were certain features of the Indian constitution so integral to its functioning and existence that they could never be cut out of the constitution. This is known as the &#x27;Basic Structure&#x27; Doctrine.
It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 26 January 1950. The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country&#x27;s fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395. India celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.

The constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, assures its citizens justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity. The original 1950 constitution is preserved in a nitrogen-filled case at the Parliament Library Building in New Delhi.

==Background==

In 1928, the All Parties Conference convened a committee in Lucknow to prepare the Constitution of India, which was known as the Nehru Report.

With the exception of scattered French and Portuguese exclaves, India was under the British rule from 1858 to 1947. From 1947 to 1950, the same legislation continued to be implemented as India was a dominion of United Kingdom for these three years, as each princely state was convinced by Sardar Patel and V. P. Menon to sign the articles of integration with India, and the British Government continued to be responsible for the external security of the country. Thus, the constitution of India repealed the Indian Independence Act 1947 and Government of India Act 1935 when it became effective on 26 January 1950. India ceased to be a dominion of the British Crown and became a sovereign, democratic republic with the constitution. Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60, 324, 366, 367, 379, 380, 388, 391, 392, 393, and 394 of the constitution came into force on 26 November 1949, and the remaining articles became effective on 26 January 1950 which is celebrated every year in India as Republic Day.

===Previous legislation===
The constitution was drawn from a number of sources. Mindful of India&#x27;s needs and conditions, its framers borrowed features of previous legislation such as the Government of India Act 1858, the Indian Councils Acts of 1861, 1892 and 1909, the Government of India Acts 1919 and 1935, and the Indian Independence Act 1947. The latter, which led to the creation of Pakistan, divided the former Constituent Assembly in two. The Amendment act of 1935 is also a very important step for making the constitution for two new born countries. Each new assembly had sovereign power to draft and enact a new constitution for the separate states.

The constitution was drafted by the Constituent Assembly, which was elected by elected members of the provincial assemblies. The 389-member assembly (reduced to 299 after the partition of India) took almost three years to draft the constitution holding eleven sessions over a 165-day period.

In the constitution assembly, a member of the drafting committee, T. T. Krishnamachari said:

B. R. Ambedkar in his concluding speech in constituent assembly on 25 November 1949 stated that:

While deliberating the revised draft constitution, the assembly moved, discussed and disposed off 2,473 amendments out of a total of 7,635.

=== Timeline of formation of the Constitution of India ===

* 6 December 1946: Formation of the Constitution Assembly (in accordance with French practice).
* 9 December 1946: The first meeting was held in the constitution hall (now the Central Hall of Parliament House). The 1st person to address was J. B. Kripalani, Sachchidananda Sinha became temporary president. (Demanding a separate state, the Muslim League boycotted the meeting.)
* 11 December 1946: The Assembly appointed Rajendra Prasad as its president, H. C. Mukherjee as its vice-president and, B. N. Rau as constitutional legal adviser. (There were initially 389 members in total, which declined to 299 after partition, out of the 389 members, 292 were from government provinces, four from chief commissioner provinces and 93 from princely states.)
* 13 December 1946: An &quot;Objective Resolution&quot; was presented by Jawaharlal Nehru, laying down the underlying principles of the constitution. This later became the Preamble of the Constitution.
* 22 January 1947: Objective resolution unanimously adopted.
* 22 July 1947: National flag adopted.
* 15 August 1947: Achieved independence. India split into the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan.
* 29 August 1947: Drafting Committee appointed with B. R. Ambedkar as its chairman. The other six members of committee were K.M. Munshi, Muhammed Sadulla, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar, Devi Prasad Khaitan and BL Mitter.
* 16 July 1948: Along with Harendra Coomar Mookerjee, V. T. Krishnamachari was also elected as second vice-president of Constituent Assembly.
* 26 November 1949: The Constitution of India was passed and adopted by the assembly.
* 24 January 1950: Last meeting of Constituent Assembly. The Constitution was signed and accepted (with 395 Articles, 8 Schedules, and 22 Parts).
* 26 January 1950: The Constitution came into force. (The process took 2 years, 11 months and 18 days—at a total expenditure of ₹6.4 million to finish.)
G. V. Mavlankar was the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) after India turned into a republic.

===Membership===
B. R. Ambedkar, Sanjay Phakey, Jawaharlal Nehru, C. Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, Vallabhbhai Patel, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar, Sandipkumar Patel, Abul Kalam Azad, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Nalini Ranjan Ghosh, and Balwantrai Mehta were key figures in the assembly, which had over 30 representatives of the scheduled classes. Frank Anthony represented the Anglo-Indian community, and the Parsis were represented by H. P. Modi. Harendra Coomar Mookerjee, a Christian assembly vice-president, chaired the minorities committee and represented non-Anglo-Indian Christians. Ari Bahadur Gurung represented the Gorkha community. Judges, such as Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Benegal Narsing Rau, K. M. Munshi and Ganesh Mavlankar were members of the assembly. Female members included Sarojini Naidu, Hansa Mehta, Durgabai Deshmukh, Amrit Kaur and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.

The first, two-day president of the assembly was Sachchidananda Sinha; Rajendra Prasad was later elected president. It met for the first time on 9 December 1946.

===Drafting===
Sir B. N. Rau, a civil servant who became the first Indian judge in the International Court of Justice and was president of the United Nations Security Council, was appointed as the assembly&#x27;s constitutional advisor in 1946. Responsible for the constitution&#x27;s general structure, Rau prepared its initial draft in February 1948. The draft of B.N. Rau consisted of 243 articles and 13 schedules which came to 395 articles and 8 schedules after discussions, debates and amendments.

At 14 August 1947 meeting of the assembly, committees were proposed. Rau&#x27;s draft was considered, debated and amended by the seven-member drafting committee, which was appointed on 29 August 1947 with B. R. Ambedkar as chair. A revised draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the assembly on 4 November 1947.

Before adopting the constitution, the assembly held eleven sessions in 165 days. On 26 November 1949, it adopted the constitution, which was signed by 284 members. The day is celebrated as National Law Day, or Constitution Day. The day was chosen to spread the importance of the constitution and to spread thoughts and ideas of Ambedkar.
The assembly&#x27;s final session convened on 24 January 1950. Each member signed two copies of the constitution, one in Hindi and the other in English. The original constitution is hand-written, with each page decorated by artists from Shantiniketan including Beohar Rammanohar Sinha and Nandalal Bose. Its calligrapher was Prem Behari Narain Raizada. The constitution was published in Dehradun and photolithographed by the Survey of India. Production of the original constitution took nearly five years. Two days later, on 26 January 1950, it became the law of India. The estimated cost of the Constituent Assembly was 6.3 crore. The constitution has had more than 100 amendments since it was enacted.

==Influence of other constitutions==
==Structure==

The Indian constitution is the world&#x27;s longest for a sovereign nation. At its enactment, it had 395 articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules. At about 145,000 words, it is the second-longest active constitution—after the Constitution of Alabama—in the world.

The amended constitution has a preamble and 470 articles, which are grouped into 25 parts. With 12 schedules and five appendices, it has been amended 105 times; the latest amendment became effective on 15 August 2021.

The constitution&#x27;s articles are grouped into the following parts:

== Governmental sources of power ==
The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government receive their power from the constitution and are bound by it. With the aid of its constitution, India is governed by a parliamentary system of government with the executive directly accountable to the legislature.

* Under Articles 52 and 53: the president of India is head of the executive branch
* Under : the duty of preserving, protecting, and defending the constitution and the law.
* Under Article 74: the prime minister is the head of the Council of Ministers, which aids and advises the president in the performance of their constitutional duties.
* Under Article 75(3): the Council of Ministers is answerable to the lower house.

The constitution is considered federal in nature, and unitary in spirit. It has features of a federation, including a codified, supreme constitution; a three-tier governmental structure (central, state and local); division of powers; bicameralism; and an independent judiciary. It also possesses unitary features such as a single constitution, single citizenship, an integrated judiciary, a flexible constitution, a strong central government, appointment of state governors by the central government, All India Services (the IAS, IFS and IPS), and emergency provisions. This unique combination makes it quasi-federal in form.

Each state and union territory has its own government. Analogous to the president and prime minister, each has a governor or (in union territories) a lieutenant governor and a chief minister. permits the president to dismiss a state government and assume direct authority if a situation arises in which state government cannot be conducted in accordance with constitution. This power, known as president&#x27;s rule, was abused as state governments came to be dismissed on flimsy grounds for political reasons. After &quot;S. R. Bommai v. Union of India&quot;, such a course of action is more difficult since the courts have asserted their right of review.

The 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts introduced the system of panchayati raj in rural areas and Nagar Palikas in urban areas. Article 370 gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

=== The legislature and amendments ===
Article 368 dictates the procedure for constitutional amendments. Amendments are additions, variations or repeal of any part of the constitution by Parliament. An amendment bill must be passed by each house of Parliament by a two-thirds majority of its total membership when at least two-thirds are present and vote. Certain amendments pertaining to the constitution&#x27;s federal nature must also be ratified by a majority of state legislatures.

Unlike ordinary bills in accordance with (except for money bills), there is no provision for a joint session of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to pass a constitutional amendment. During a parliamentary recess, the president cannot promulgate ordinances under his legislative powers under .

Despite the supermajority requirement for amendments to pass, the Indian constitution is the world&#x27;s most frequently-amended national governing document. The constitution is so specific in spelling out government powers that many amendments address issues dealt with by statute in other democracies.

In 2000, the Justice Manepalli Narayana Rao Venkatachaliah Commission was formed to examine a constitutional update. The commission submitted its report on 31 March 2002. However, the recommendations of this report have not been accepted by the consecutive governments.

The government of India establishes term-based law commissions to recommend legal reforms, facilitating the rule of law.

====Limitations====
In &quot;Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that an amendment cannot destroy what it seeks to modify; it cannot tinker with the constitution&#x27;s basic structure or framework, which are immutable. Such an amendment will be declared invalid, although no part of the constitution is protected from amendment; the basic structure doctrine does not protect any one provision of the constitution. According to the doctrine, the constitution&#x27;s basic features (when &quot;read as a whole&quot;) cannot be abridged or abolished. These &quot;basic features&quot; have not been fully defined, and whether a particular provision of the constitution is a &quot;basic feature&quot; is decided by the courts.

The &quot;Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala&quot; decision laid down the constitution&#x27;s basic structure:
# Supremacy of the constitution
# Republican, democratic form of government
# Its secular nature
# Separation of powers
# Its federal character

This implies that Parliament can only amend the constitution to the limit of its basic structure. The Supreme Court or a high court may declare the amendment null and void if this is violated, after a judicial review. This is typical of parliamentary governments, where the judiciary checks parliamentary power.

In its 1967 &quot;Golak Nath v. State of Punjab&quot; decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Punjab could not restrict any fundamental rights protected by the basic structure doctrine. The extent of land ownership and practice of a profession, in this case, were considered fundamental rights. The ruling was overturned with the ratification of the 24th Amendment in 1971.

===The judiciary===
The judiciary is the final arbiter of the constitution. Its duty (mandated by the constitution) is to act as a watchdog, preventing any legislative or executive act from overstepping constitutional bounds. The judiciary protects the fundamental rights of the people (enshrined in the constitution) from infringement by any state body, and balances the conflicting exercise of power between the central government and a state (or states).

The courts are expected to remain unaffected by pressure exerted by other branches of the state, citizens or interest groups. An independent judiciary has been held as a basic feature of the constitution, which cannot be changed by the legislature or the executive. Article 50 of the Constitution provides that the state must take measures to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services.

====Judicial review====

Judicial review was adopted by the constitution of India from judicial review in the United States. In the Indian constitution, judicial review is dealt with in . The constitution is the supreme power of the nation, and governs all laws. According to Article 13:

# All pre-constitutional laws, if they conflict wholly or in part with the constitution, shall have all conflicting provisions deemed ineffective until an amendment to the constitution ends the conflict; the law will again come into force if it is compatible with the constitution as amended (the Doctrine of Eclipse).
# Laws made after the adoption of the constitution must be compatible with it, or they will be deemed void &quot;ab initio&quot;.
# In such situations, the Supreme Court (or a high court) determines if a law is in conformity with the constitution. If such an interpretation is not possible because of inconsistency (and where separation is possible), the provision which is inconsistent with the constitution is considered void. In addition to Article 13, Articles 32, 226 and 227 provide the constitutional basis for judicial review.

Due to the adoption of the Thirty-eighth Amendment, the Supreme Court was not allowed to preside over any laws adopted during a state of emergency which infringe fundamental rights under article 32 (the right to constitutional remedies). The Forty-second Amendment widened Article 31C and added Articles 368(4) and 368(5), stating that any law passed by Parliament could not be challenged in court. The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Minerva Mills v. Union of India&quot; that judicial review is a basic characteristic of the constitution, overturning Articles 368(4), 368(5) and 31C.

=== The executive ===

Chapter 1 of the Constitution of India creates a parliamentary system, with a Prime Minister who, in practice, exercises most executive power. The prime minister must have the support of a majority of the members of the Lok Sabha, or lower House of Parliament. If the Prime Minister does not have the support of a majority, the Lok Sabha can pass a motion of no confidence, removing the Prime Minister from office. Thus the Prime Minister is the member of parliament who leads the majority party or a coalition comprising a majority. The Prime Minister governs with the aid of a Council of Ministers, which the Prime Minister appoints and whose members head ministries. Importantly, Article 75 establishes that &quot;the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People&quot; or Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha interprets this article to mean that the entire Council of Ministers can be subjected to a no confidence motion. If a no confidence motion succeeds, the entire Council of Ministers must resign.

Despite the Prime Minister exercising executive power in practice, the constitution bestows all the national government&#x27;s executive power in the office of the President. This de jure power is not exercised in reality, however. Article 74 requires the President follow the &quot;aid and advice&quot; of the council, headed by the Prime Minister. In practice, this means that President&#x27;s role is mostly ceremonial, with the Prime Minister exercising executive power because the President is obligated to act on the Prime Minister&#x27;s wishes. The President does retain the power to ask the council to reconsider its advice, however, an action the President may take publicly. The council is not required to make any changes before resubmitting the advice to the President, in which case the President is constitutionally required to adhere to it, overriding the President&#x27;s discretion. Previous Presidents have used this occasion to make public statements about their reasoning for sending a decision back to the council, in an attempt to sway public opinion. This system, with an executive who only possesses nominal power and an official &quot;advisor&quot; who possess actual power, is based on the British system and is a result of colonial influences on India before and during the writing of its constitution.

The President is chosen by an electoral college composed of the members of both the national and state legislatures. Article 55 outlines the specifics of the electoral college. Half of the votes in the electoral college are assigned to state representatives in proportion to the population of each state and the other half are assigned to the national representatives. The voting is conducted using a secret, single transferable vote.

While the Constitution gives the legislative powers to the two Houses of Parliament, Article 111 requires the President&#x27;s signature for a bill to become law. Just as with the advice of the council, the President can refuse to sign and send it back to the Parliament, but the Parliament can in turn send it back to the President who must then sign it.

==== Dismissal of the Prime Minister ====
Despite the President&#x27;s mandate to obey the advice of the Prime Minister and the council, Article 75 declares that both &quot;shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.&quot; This means the President has the constitutional power to dismiss the Prime Minister or Council at anytime. If the Prime Minister still retained a majority vote in the Lok Sabha, however, this could trigger a constitutional crisis because the same article of the Constitution states that the Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha and must command a majority in it. In practice the issue has never arisen, though President Zail Singh threatened to remove Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi from office in 1987.

==== Presidential power to legislate ====
When either or both Houses of Parliament are not in session, the Prime Minister, acting via the President, can unilaterally exercise the legislative power, creating ordinances that have the force of law. These ordinances expire six weeks after Parliament reconvenes or sooner if both Houses disapprove. The Constitution declares that ordinances should only be issued when circumstances arise that require &quot;immediate action.&quot; Because this term is not defined, governments have begun abusing the ordinance system to enact laws that could not pass both Houses of Parliament, according to some commentators. This appears to be more common with divided government; when the Prime Minister&#x27;s party controls the lower house but not the upper house, ordinances can be used to avoid needing the approval of the opposition in the upper house. In recent years, around ten ordinances have been passed annually, though at the peak of their use, over 30 were passed in a single year. Ordinances can vary widely on their topic; recent examples of ordinances include items as varied as modifications to land owner rights, emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes to banking regulations.

== Federalism ==

The first article of the Constitution declares that India is a &quot;Union of States&quot;. Under the Constitution, the States retain key powers for themselves and have a strong influence over the national government via the Rajya Sabha. However, the Constitution does provide key limits on their powers and gives final say in many cases to the national government.

=== State powers in the Constitution ===

==== Rajya Sabha ====

At the Union level, the States are represented in the Rajya Sabha or Council of States. The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution lays out the number of seats that each State controls in the Council of States, and they are based roughly on each State&#x27;s population. The members of each state legislature elect and appoint these representatives in the Council of States. On most topics the Rajya Sabha is coequal with the lower house or Lok Sabha, and its consent is required for a bill to become a law. Additionally, as one of the Houses of Parliament, any amendment to the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha to go into effect. These provisions allow the States significant impact on national politics through their representation in the &quot;federal chamber&quot;.

==== State List ====
The Constitution provides the States with a long list of powers exclusive to their jurisdiction. Generally only State Legislatures are capable of passing laws implementing these powers; the Union government is prohibited from doing so. These powers are contained in the second list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, known as the State List. The areas on the State List are wide-ranging and include topics like public health and order and a variety of taxes. The State List grants the states control over the police, healthcare, agriculture, elections, and more.

Powers can only be permanently removed from the State List via a constitutional amendment approved by a majority of the states. The Rajya Sabha, as the representative of the States, can temporarily remove an item from the State List so the Union parliament can legislate on it. This requires a two-thirds vote and lasts for a renewable one-year period.

==== Amendments ====
In addition to exerting influence over the amendment process via the Rajya Sabha, the States are sometimes involved in the amendment process. This special, entrenched process is triggered when an amendment to the Constitution specifically concerns the States by modifying the legislature or the powers reserved to the states in the Seventh Schedule. When this occurs, an amendment must be ratified by a majority of state legislatures for the amendment to go into effect.

=== Limitations on state powers ===

==== Union and Concurrent Lists ====
While the State List mentioned above provides powers for the States, there are two other lists in the Seventh Schedule that generally weaken them. These are the Union and Concurrent lists. The Union List is the counterpart to the State List, containing the areas of exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government, where the states are prohibited from legislating. Items on the Union List include the national defense, international relations, immigration, banking, and interstate commerce.

The final list is the Concurrent List which contains the topics on which &quot;both&quot; the Union and State-level governments may legislate on. These topics include courts and criminal law, unions, social security, and education. In general, when the Union and State laws on a Concurrent List item conflict, the Union-level laws prevail. The only way for the State-level law to override the national one is with the consent of the President, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Additionally, any powers not on any of the three lists are reserved for the Union government and not for the states.

==== Appointment of governors ====
The Governor of each State is given the executive power of the respective State by the Constitution. These Governors are appointed directly by the President of the central government. Because the Prime Minister acts via the President, the Prime Minister is the one who chooses the Governors in practice. Once appointed, a Governor serves for a five-year term or can be replaced by the President at any time, if asked to do so by the Prime Minister. Because the Union government can remove a Governor at any time, it is possible that Governors may act in a way the Union Government wants, to the detriment of their state, so that they can maintain their office. This has become a larger issue as the State Legislatures are often controlled by different parties than that of the Union Prime Minister, unlike the early years of the constitution. For example, Governors have used stalling tactics to delay giving their assent to legislation that the Union Government disapproves of.

In general the influence of the Union on State politics via the Governor is limited, however, by the fact that the Governor must listen to the advice of the Chief Minister of the State who needs to command a majority in the State Legislature. There are key areas where the Governor does not need to heed the advice of the Chief Minister. For example, the Governor can send a bill to president for consideration instead of signing it into law.

==== Creation of states ====

Perhaps the most direct power over the States is the Union&#x27;s ability to unilaterally create new states out of territories or existing states and to modify and diminish the boundaries of existing states. To do so, Parliament must pass a simple law with no supermajority requirements. The States involved do not have a say on the outcome but the State Legislature must be asked to comment. The most recent state to be created was Telangana in 2014. More recently, Ladakh was created as a new Union Territory after being split off from Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, and Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli were combined into a single Union Territory in 2020.

=== Federalism and the courts ===

While the states have separate legislative and executive branches, they share the judiciary with the Union government. This is different from other federal court systems, such as the United States, where state courts mainly apply state law and federal courts mainly apply federal law. Under the Indian constitution, the High Courts of the States are directly constituted by the national constitution. The constitution also allows states to set up lower courts under and controlled by the state&#x27;s High Court. Cases heard at or appealed to the High Courts can be furter appealed to the Supreme Court of India in some cases. All cases, whether dealing with federal or state laws, move up the same judicial hierarchy, creating a system sometimes termed integrated federalism.

== International law ==
The Constitution includes treaty making as part of the executive power given to the President. Because the President must act in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister is the chief party responsible for making international treaties in the Constitution. Because the legislative power rests with Parliament, the President&#x27;s signature on an international agreement does not bring it into effect domestically or enable courts to enforce its provisions. Article 253 of the Constitution bestows this power on Parliament, enabling it to make laws necessary for implementing international agreements and treaties. These provisions indicate that the Constitution of India is dualist, that is, treaty law only takes effect when a domestic law passed using the normal processes incorporates it into domestic law.

Recent Supreme Court decisions have begun to change this convention, incorporating aspects of international law without enabling legislation from parliament. For example, in &quot;Gramophone Company of India Ltd. v Birendra Bahadur Pandey&quot;, the Court held that &quot;the rules of international law are incorporated into national law and considered to be part of the national law, unless they are in conflict with an Act of Parliament.&quot; In essence, this implies that international law applies domestically &quot;unless&quot; parliament says it does not. This decision moves the Indian Constitution to a more hybrid regime, but not to a fully monist one.
== Flexibility ==
According to Granville Austin, &quot;The Indian constitution is first and foremost a social document, and is aided by its Parts III &amp; IV (Fundamental Rights &amp; Directive Principles of State Policy, respectively) acting together, as its chief instruments and its conscience, in realising the goals set by it for all the people.&quot; The constitution has deliberately been worded in generalities (not in vague terms) to ensure its flexibility. John Marshall, the fourth chief justice of the United States, said that a constitution&#x27;s &quot;great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves.&quot; A document &quot;intended to endure for ages to come&quot;, it must be interpreted not only based on the intention and understanding of its framers, but in the existing social and political context.

The &quot;right to life&quot; guaranteed under Article 21 has been expanded to include a number of human rights, including:

* the right to a speedy trial;
* the right to water;
* the right to earn a livelihood,
* the right to health, and
* the right to education.

At the conclusion of his book, &quot;Making of India&#x27;s Constitution&quot;, retired Supreme Court Justice Hans Raj Khanna wrote:

== Translations into Indian languages ==
The Constitution of India is translated into only a few of the 22 scheduled languages of the Indian Republic.

=== Hindi translation ===
The Hindi translation of the Indian Constitution is notably the first translation among Indian languages. This task was undertaken by Raghu Vira, a distinguished linguist, scholar, politician, and member of the Constituent Assembly. 

In 1948, nearly two years after the formation of the Constituent Assembly, Rajendra Prasad entrusted Raghu Vira and his team to translate the English text of the Constitution into Hindi. Raghu Vira, using Sanskrit as a common base akin to the role of Latin in European languages, applied the rules of &quot;sandhi&quot; (joining), &quot;samasa&quot; (compounding), &quot;upasarga&quot; (prefix), and &quot;pratyaya&quot; (suffix) to develop several new terms for scientific and parliamentary use. The terminology was subsequently approved by an All India Committee of Linguistic Experts, representing thirteen languages: Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Odia (then spelled as Oriya), Assamese, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, and Urdu. The vocabulary developed for Hindi later served as a base for translating the constitution into several other Indic languages.

=== Bengali translation ===
The Constitution of India was first translated from English into Bengali language and published in 1983, as (romanised: &quot;Bharoter Songbidhan&quot;) in Kolkata, through the collective efforts of the Government of West Bengal and the Union Government of India. Its second edition was published in 1987, and third in 2022. It contains up to the One hundred and fifth Amendment of the Constitution.

=== Meitei translation ===

The Constitution of India was first translated from English into Meitei language (officially known as Manipuri language) and published on 3 January 2019, as , in Imphal, through the collective efforts of the Government of Manipur and the Union Government of India. It was written in Bengali script. It contains up to the Ninety-fifth Amendment of the Constitution. The translation project was started in 2016 by the Directorate of Printing &amp; Stationery of the Government of Manipur.

On 19 November 2023, Nongthombam Biren Singh, the then Chief Minister of Manipur declared that it will be transliterated into in digital edition.

On 26 November 2023, Nongthombam Biren Singh, the then Chief Minister of the Government of Manipur, officially released the diglot edition of the Constitution of India, in the in Manipuri language and English, at the Cabinet hall of the CM Secretariat in Imphal, as part of the Constitution Day celebrations (National Law Day) of the Republic of India, containing up to the 105th Amendment of the Constitution, for the first time in its history.

<text>Anthony Kiedis ( ; born November 1, 1962) is an American musician and lead vocalist of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. Kiedis and his fellow band members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

Kiedis spent his youth in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with his mother, and then moved shortly before his twelfth birthday to live with his father in Hollywood. While attending Fairfax High School, Kiedis befriended students Flea and Hillel Slovak, who were members of the band Anthym. After high school, Kiedis took classes at UCLA, but dropped out in his sophomore year.

When Kiedis received an offer to be the opening act for a local band, he enlisted Flea, Slovak, and drummer Jack Irons. After a show under the name Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, the band progressed and the lineup eventually became the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He has recorded thirteen studio albums with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Kiedis&#x27;s lyrical style has evolved throughout his career; early recordings discussed topics such as sex and life in Los Angeles, while more recent songs focus on more reflective themes including love, addiction, and loss. He struggled with addiction until 2000, and maintains that he has been clean since then.

==Early life and education==
Kiedis was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on November 1, 1962, to Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Nobel and struggling actor John Michael Kiedis, known professionally as Blackie Dammett. His paternal grandfather&#x27;s family emigrated from Lithuania in the early 1900s. In 2004, Kiedis wrote that his paternal grandmother, Molly VanderVeen, &quot;was a pastiche of English, Irish, French, and Dutch (and, as we&#x27;ve recently discovered, some Mohican blood)&quot;. In 1966, when Kiedis was three years old, his parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother in Grand Rapids. His mother later remarried and had two more children. Each summer, Kiedis would visit his father in Hollywood, California, for two weeks, where the two would bond. Kiedis idolized his father, recalling: &quot;Those trips to California were the happiest, most carefree, the-world-is-a-beautiful-oyster times I&#x27;d ever experienced.&quot; In 1974, when Kiedis was 12, he moved to Hollywood to live with his father full-time.

Kiedis&#x27;s father sold drugs, and the two often used marijuana and cocaine together. At age 14, Kiedis accidentally tried heroin for the first time, mistaking it for cocaine. Through his father, Kiedis, who worked under the stage name of Cole Dammett, landed his first acting role, appearing as Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s character&#x27;s son in the 1978 film, &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; He landed two more acting jobs, in an ABC Afterschool Special and an appearance in the film &quot;Jokes My Folks Never Told Me&quot;.

Kiedis attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, where he struggled to find friends, but he met his future bandmate Flea. The two had a brief confrontation, but then became best friends and bonded while sitting next to each other in driver&#x27;s education class. Kiedis recalled, &quot;We were drawn to each other by the forces of mischief and love and we became virtually inseparable. We were both social outcasts. We found each other and it turned out to be the longest-lasting friendship of my life.&quot; Kiedis became a significant influence on Flea, exposing him to rock music, particularly punk rock. At age 15, while Kiedis and Flea were jumping from a building into a swimming pool, Kiedis missed the pool and broke his back, but recovered.

At age 15, Kiedis met future bandmate Hillel Slovak after seeing him perform with his band Anthym. After the show, Slovak invited Kiedis to his house for a snack. Kiedis later described the experience, &quot;Within a few minutes of hanging out with Hillel, I sensed that he was absolutely different from most of the people I&#x27;d spent time with ... He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting.&quot; Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea often used LSD, heroin, cocaine, and speed recreationally. Kiedis excelled in school, often receiving straight-A grades. In June 1980, Kiedis graduated with honors from high school. That August, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles to study writing.

==Red Hot Chili Peppers==


===1983–1984: Formation and first album===

Kiedis began working with Flea and drummer Jack Irons, where he was described as a &quot;manic master of ceremonies&quot; before he even began singing for the group. Irons and Slovak began playing together in a high school band called Chain Reaction. The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chile-born vocalist and guitarist Alain Johannes. Strasman was intent on becoming a lawyer, and quit the band to focus on college. Flea soon offered Kiedis a position in the band. Kiedis began as a hype man, going out in front of the band and getting the audience pumped up.

Kiedis, Slovak, and Flea began to create their own music after finding inspiration in a punk-funk fusion band called Defunkt. Kiedis rejected the violence and misogyny of the Los Angeles punk rock scene, and wanted to create a more peaceful environment to encourage women to come to concerts. The three reunited with Irons, who had recently left his previous band Anthym, to form a new band called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, titled &quot;Out in L.A.&quot;, and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once. The song was based on a guitar riff that Slovak wrote while jamming with Irons, and was not meant to become a real song until Kiedis decided to rap over the music. Mike Chester, a friend of Kiedis&#x27;, invited the band to open for his act Mike and Neighbor&#x27;s Voices at The Rhythm Lounge, as he felt that Kiedis had potential as a frontman. Slovak and Flea felt that Kiedis did not have enough vocal experience, but the two eventually agreed to perform. Kiedis later described the performance: &quot;All the anticipation of the moment hit me, and I instinctively knew that the miracle of manipulating energy and tapping into an infinite source of power and harnessing it in a small space with your friends was what I had been put on this earth to do.&quot;

After the group&#x27;s first show at The Rhythm Lounge, the owner of the bar asked them to return, but with two songs instead of one. After several more shows, and the addition of several songs to their repertoire, the band&#x27;s name was changed to The Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band&#x27;s concert repertoire grew to ten songs as a result of months of playing at local nightclubs and bars. At a performance at a strip club in Hollywood called Kit Kat Club, the band members performed wearing only socks on their penises, an idea formed by Kiedis. This gained the band notoriety, and club owners even began booking the group on the condition that they would perform in this manner. The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI. Irons and Slovak, however, decided to leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers in order to pursue a &quot;more serious&quot; future with their band Anthym, which by this time had been renamed What Is This? Kiedis ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. Kiedis and Flea hired drummer Cliff Martinez from The Weirdos and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Iron&#x27;s and Slovak&#x27;s places, respectively. Andy Gill, formerly of Gang of Four, agreed to produce their first album, 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;. Gill and Sherman clashed with Kiedis and Flea; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album&#x27;s production. Sherman was fired from the band following the tour and replaced by a returning Slovak.

===1985–1988: &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;, &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;, and death of Hillel Slovak===

Funk musician George Clinton was hired to produce the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;, as Slovak returned on guitar. The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly. &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; was released in August 1985. It received only a bit more attention than &quot;The Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot; with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year&#x27;s end. The band hired Michael Beinhorn, their last resort among potential producers, to work on their next album. What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid-1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that &quot;it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy&quot;. Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album&#x27;s material by themselves. Both Kiedis and Slovak struggled with debilitating heroin addictions, which grew worse as the band was preparing to record &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;. Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically, and appeared at rehearsal &quot;literally asleep&quot;. He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo drug rehabilitation. During that time, the band won the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; Band of the Year award, which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey. He visited his mother in Michigan for guidance, who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance. Kiedis checked into a Salvation Army rehabilitation clinic in Grand Rapids, Michigan, an experience which he initially detested until he noted that the other people in the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him. He moved in with his mother after twenty days at the clinic, a time which marked the first time he was completely abstinent from drugs since he was eleven years old. After Kiedis completed his stint in rehabilitation, he felt a &quot;whole new wave of enthusiasm&quot; due to his sobriety and wrote the lyrics to a new song titled &quot;Fight Like a Brave&quot; on the flight home.

He rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record the album. Upon returning home, he began dating actress Ione Skye, whom Flea met while appearing with her in the 1987 science fiction film &quot;Stranded&quot;. Although Kiedis had recently become clean, his withdrawal symptoms increased and affected his musical contributions to the group. After fifty days of sobriety, Kiedis decided to take drugs again as a one-time attempt to celebrate his new music, which led to his resumed addiction. The recording process for the album became difficult, and Kiedis would often disappear to seek drugs. Producer Michael Beinhorn recalled that, &quot;There were points in pre-production where I really thought the record wasn&#x27;t gonna get made.&quot; Kiedis felt &quot;excruciating pain and guilt and shame&quot; when he would miss a recording session so he would try to write lyrics while searching for drugs; although the band members were upset by his drug use and frequent disappearances, they were impressed with his musical output at the time.

After the international tour in support of &quot;Uplift&quot;, Slovak died of a heroin overdose in 1988. Following Slovak&#x27;s death, Kiedis fled to a small fishing village in Mexico and did not attend his funeral, considering the situation to be surreal and dreamlike. Although he found the death to be a shock, he initially was not &quot;scared straight&quot; and continued to use heroin. A few weeks later, his friend convinced him to check into rehab and visit Slovak&#x27;s grave, which inspired him to get clean. Irons was unable to cope with Slovak&#x27;s death and subsequently quit the band, saying that he did not want to be part of something that resulted in the death of his friend. Kiedis and Flea decided to continue making music, hoping to continue what Slovak &quot;helped build&quot;.

Following Slovak&#x27;s death, Kiedis and Flea took some time to collect themselves, but decided to keep the band together. Guitarist DeWayne McKnight and drummer D. H. Peligro were added to replace Slovak and Irons. McKnight soon began to create tension within the group, as his style did not mesh with the rest of the band. Peligro, the former drummer of the punk rock band Dead Kennedys, was a friend of John Frusciante, an eighteen-year-old guitarist and avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. Peligro introduced Frusciante to Flea, and the three jammed together on several occasions. Kiedis was impressed with Frusciante&#x27;s skill, and astonished by his knowledge of the Chili Peppers&#x27; repertoire. McKnight was fired, and Frusciante accepted an invitation to join the band. The band started writing music for the next album and finished out 1988 with a brief tour. Peligro was fired in November and through auditions, the Chili Peppers brought in drummer Chad Smith as his replacement shortly after.

===1989–1993: &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; and &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;===
The Chili Peppers entered the studio, and completed recording of their fourth album, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, in early 1989. Upon release, the album was met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention, peaking at number fifty-two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Although his band was experiencing greater success, Kiedis&#x27; withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his personal life. This led to the end of his two-year relationship with Ione Skye in December 1989: &quot;I had managed to stay sober by not ingesting drugs, so my body had healed from all that torturous activity, but my mind still wasn&#x27;t healthy enough to work out all the problems that come up in a relationship.&quot;

In 1990, Kiedis was convicted for indecent exposure and sexual battery from an incident at George Mason University in Fairfax County, Virginia, in April 1989. He was ordered to pay a fine on both counts. Kiedis touched a woman&#x27;s face with his penis after a concert at George Mason University in Fairfax County on April 21, 1989.

The band sought to record their next album &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. The band&#x27;s producer Rick Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house. The band decided that they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though Smith, convinced the location was haunted, refused to stay. During this stage, Kiedis began to write about anguish, and the self-mutilating thoughts he would experience as a result of his heroin and cocaine addiction. Rubin stumbled upon one of Kiedis&#x27;s poems that would become the lyrics to &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, and suggested Kiedis show it to the rest of the band. Kiedis was apprehensive because he believed the lyrics to be &quot;too soft&quot; and unlike the band&#x27;s style. After singing the verse to Frusciante, they began structuring the song the next day. The two worked for several hours arranging chords and melodies until they both agreed it was complete. The song later became a major hit, peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

When &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; was released on September 24, 1991, it received an overwhelmingly positive critical response. The album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and went on to sell over seven million copies in the U.S. alone. The album&#x27;s ensuing tour was critically acclaimed—the Chili Peppers commonly performed shows with over twenty thousand in attendance. Up-and-coming bands Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins also toured with them during their United States tour. The massive attention the Chili Peppers started receiving caused Frusciante to feel extremely uncomfortable, and he abruptly quit the band during the Japanese leg of the album&#x27;s tour. The band hired guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the remaining tour dates. The band appeared live on the Grammy&#x27;s ceremony with George Clinton&#x27;s P-Funk collective and many others, performing a medley that included &quot;Give It Away&quot;.

===1994–1997: &quot;One Hot Minute&quot;===

Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written leading Chad Smith to publicly announce that Kiedis was suffering from writer&#x27;s block, though Kiedis denied this. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month and their sixth album &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; was released in September 1995, featuring the band&#x27;s new guitarist Dave Navarro. The album was met with mixed reviews and was a major departure from the band&#x27;s funk-punk sound. The tour to support the album was also met with mixed results. Chad Smith broke his arm prior to the launch of the U.S. tour in 1995 so it was delayed until early 1996. Near the tour&#x27;s end, Kiedis was involved in a motorcycle accident, which left him with a broken arm. The tour ended with the band&#x27;s final set being cut short due to a massive typhoon. The year 1997 was dubbed &quot;The Year of Nothing&quot; by the band&#x27;s bassist Flea.

===1998–2010: &quot;Californication&quot;, &quot;By the Way&quot;, and &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;===
The band regrouped in 1998 to begin writing for their seventh studio album; however, Navarro was now battling his own drug problems. This caused major tension between Kiedis and Navarro, who was fired from the band in early 1998. Flea informed Kiedis that he felt the only way the band could possibly continue is if Frusciante re-joined the band. In the years following Frusciante&#x27;s departure from the Chili Peppers, he had developed a vicious addiction to both heroin and cocaine that left him in poverty and near death. He was talked into admitting himself to drug rehabilitation in January 1998. In April 1998, following Frusciante&#x27;s three-month completion, Flea visited his former bandmate and openly invited him to re-join the band, an invitation Frusciante readily accepted. Within the week, and for the first time in six years, the foursome gathered to play and jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band released &quot;Californication&quot; on June 8, 1999.

Immediately following the release of &quot;Californication&quot;, the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close Woodstock &#x27;99, which became infamous for the violence it resulted in. The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields had gone out of control. When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s song &quot;Fire&quot; to finish their set as a favor to Hendrix&#x27;s sister, the disruption escalated into violence when several women who had been crowd surfing and moshing were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that &quot;It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn&#x27;t symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... We woke up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing &#x27;Fire&#x27;.&quot;

The writing and formation of &quot;By the Way&quot; began immediately following the culmination of &quot;Californication&#x27;s&quot; world tour, in the Spring of 2001. As with &quot;Californication&quot;, much of the creation took place in the band members&#x27; homes, and other locations of practice, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: &quot;We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it.&quot; Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, &quot;writing &quot;By the Way&quot;...was a whole different experience from &quot;Californication&quot;. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence.&quot; The album marked a change in the band&#x27;s sound, and Kiedis began writing songs reflective of his romantic relationships and drug addictions.

The formation and recording of &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; took place at &quot;The Mansion&quot;, the former home of Harry Houdini where the Chili Peppers had recorded their 1991 breakthrough &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. Kiedis noted that during the recording process of the album &quot;everybody was in a good mood. There was very little tension, very little anxiety, very little weirdness going on and every day we showed up to this funky room in the Valley, and everyone felt more comfortable than ever bringing in their ideas.&quot; The album was released on May 9, 2006.

Following a hugely successful world tour to support &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;, the band decided to take an extended year long break from music in 2008. According to Kiedis, there was a collective decision &quot;not [to] do anything Red Hot Chili Peppers-related for a minimum of one year. [...] We started in 1999, with the writing and the recording of &quot;Californication&quot;, and we didn&#x27;t really stop until the tour ended last year. We were all emotionally and mentally zapped at the end of that run.&quot; During the break, Frusciante departed amicably with the band in July 2009 (although it wasn&#x27;t publicly announced until December 2009). Josh Klinghoffer, a touring guitarist for the Chili Peppers and often collaborator with Frusciante was hired as his replacement.

===2011–2015: &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction===
On August 26, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released their tenth album, &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;. On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were named 2012 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiedis said it was very emotional and the first person he told was his father, who cried when hearing the news. On January 11, 2012, the Chili Peppers announced that they were forced to postpone the U.S. leg of their &quot;I&#x27;m with You tour&quot; due to multiple foot injuries suffered by Kiedis. Kiedis has been battling through foot injuries since 2006 when he injured his foot onstage and finally was able to have surgery during a break in the band&#x27;s tour in January 2012. During the surgery, Kiedis had a crushed sesamoid bone removed and a detached flexor tendon repaired. The band was able to resume their tour and kicked off the U.S. leg on March 29, 2012. The tour in support of &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; ended in April 2013 and the band continued touring into mid-2014 which included a halftime performance with Bruno Mars at the Super Bowl in February 2014.

In November 2014, Kiedis set out on a mini-book tour to promote the Chili Peppers book, &quot;Fandemonium&quot;. This included book signings, a Q&amp;A and an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot; where Kiedis sat in the entire show with The Roots performing Chili Peppers songs.

Kiedis received the George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement, presented at the UCLA Spring Sing on May 16, 2015. Kiedis&#x27; mother, Peggy Noble Idema, commented on her son receiving the award by saying &quot;This really makes me proud. Both my parents and Grandpa Idema were huge Gershwin fans. I grew up with their music.&quot; Following his acceptance speech, Kiedis was joined on stage by his Chili Peppers bandmate Josh Klinghoffer for an acoustic performance of &quot;Otherside&quot;, a cover of Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;If You Want Me to Stay&quot; and &quot;By the Way&quot;.

===2016–present: Health scare, &quot;The Getaway&quot;, &quot;Unlimited Love&quot;, and &quot;Return Of the Dream Canteen&quot;===
On May 14, 2016, the band were forced to cancel their headlining slot at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast, as Kiedis was rushed to the hospital prior to the band appearing on stage. It was confirmed that Kiedis was suffering from intestinal flu and was expected to make a full recovery; however, the band was forced to postpone their iHeartRadio album preview show on May 17, 2016, which was rescheduled for May 26.

Kiedis and the Chili Peppers returned to the stage on May 22, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio. In a May 20, 2016 interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada, his first since being released from the hospital, Kiedis said that his illness was brought on by an &quot;inflammation in my guts&quot; which he said was complicated by a recent stomach virus and existing scar tissue from previous hernia operations which required his stomach being pumped at the hospital.

During a break in filming of &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; carpool karaoke segment which aired on June 14, 2016, and featured the band singing karaoke to their music with the host while driving through Los Angeles, Kiedis performed emergency CPR on a baby. &quot;A woman came out of her house, holding a child saying, &#x27;My baby, my baby, my baby can&#x27;t breathe!&#x27;&quot; Kiedis said. &quot;The woman thrust the baby into my arms, the baby was not breathing and I thought, &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna try and do a little baby CPR real quick, see if I can get some air in this kid. So I started rubbing the belly, bubbles came out of the mouth, the eyes rolled back into place, the ambulance showed up and I handed the baby over, who was now breathing and fine, and we went back to Carpool Karaoke.&quot;

The Red Hot Chili Peppers released their eleventh studio album, &quot;The Getaway&quot;, on June 17, 2016.

On October 20, 2018, Kiedis, who was attending the Los Angeles Lakers game with Flea, was ejected from the game for swearing and giving the middle finger to Chris Paul of the Houston Rockets.

In December 2019, the Red Hot Chili Peppers announced that guitarist John Frusciante would be returning to replace Josh Klinghoffer. As of May 2021, the band had nearly completed their twelfth studio album &quot;Unlimited Love&quot; and on October 7, 2021, the band announced dates for the Global Stadium Tour beginning in June and concluding in September, later extending the tour to the following February. The tour, in support of the album, featured the band&#x27;s first ever headlining stadium shows in the U.S. Unlimited Love was released on April 1, 2022.

On December 20, 2021, Kiedis appeared at Dave Navarro and Billy Morrison&#x27;s third annual Above Ground benefit concert in Los Angeles, where they performed a cover of Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. This marked the first time Kiedis and Navarro performed together in 24 years since Navarro was fired from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

On October 14, 2022, The Red Hot Chili Peppers released their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Return of the Dream Canteen&quot;.

==Other projects==
Using the stage name Cole Dammett (adapted from his father&#x27;s stage name, Blackie Dammett), Kiedis landed a number of small roles in television and film as a teenager in the late 1970s. His early credits include &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; and the 1978 ABC Afterschool Special &quot;It&#x27;s a Mile from Here to Glory&quot;. Resuming his acting work in the 1990s, Kiedis played a hooligan surfer named Tone, in the 1991 Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze movie &quot;Point Break&quot;. &quot;The Chase&quot;, a 1994 movie starring Charlie Sheen as an estranged man trying to escape the cops with a young woman he kidnapped, had Flea and Kiedis playing metalheads who chase Sheen&#x27;s character in a 4 × 4 truck and end up crashing.

Kiedis also organized the New American Music Union, a two-day summer music festival set for August 2008 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He assembled a lineup of musicians including Bob Dylan, The Raconteurs, Gnarls Barkley, The Roots, and a second stage featuring college bands. (The lineup did not include Kiedis or the Red Hot Chili Peppers.) In 2011, Kiedis, along with his son Everly, appeared in the documentary, Bob and the Monster. The documentary details the life and career of musician and drug counselor, Bob Forrest. On May 11, 2011, Anthony donated a MTV European Music Award that the band had previously won to help raise funds for ongoing relief in devastated areas of Japan, which was hit with an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.

Kiedis and Flea were executive producers of the 2014 film &quot;Low Down&quot;, which is based on the life of jazz pianist Joe Albany.

In June 2015, Kiedis and his son Everly Bear, along with Cher and Willow Smith, were revealed to be the &quot;new faces&quot; of Marc Jacobs Fall 2015 ad campaign.

In February 2016, the Chili Peppers performed at the &quot;Feel the Bern&quot; fundraiser in support of Bernie Sanders.

On January 11, 2019, Kiedis co-authored a Rolling Stone opinion piece with Rory Kennedy, a filmmaker and daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and the Malibu Foundation&#x27;s Trevor Neilson in which he listed the human, financial and environmental cost of global climate conditions. Kiedis said &quot;since our federal government is failing us, we must rely on our state and local governments to lead the charge.&quot; Three days later, Kiedis and the Chili Peppers performed at a benefit for the victims of the Woolsey Fire in California. The fires destroyed over 1,500 homes, killed four people and also forced Kiedis, his family and band members to evacuate their homes as well. The recording of the band&#x27;s twelfth album was also put on hold due to the deadly fires. Drummer Chad Smith said &quot;myself and Anthony both live in Point Dume. Seventy houses in our neighborhood burned down. Ours was spared, luckily.&quot;

On April 5, 2023, it was announced that Kiedis along with Bob Forrest and Ron Burkle had formed the production company Said and Done Entertainment. Their first project will be an animated series for TBS called &quot;Hellicious&quot; which is based on the comic book of the same name. Kiedis will voice one of the main characters Briggy Bundy and will also serve as the executive producer for the series.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===

While creating lyrics and melodies for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiedis has drawn from various sources for inspiration. His first musical memory was hearing Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; at age eleven: &quot;It moved me so much that I insisted my mother buy me the 45.&quot; In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five&#x27;s &quot;The Message&quot; and the &quot;in-your-face sexual lyrics&quot; of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;. Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; lyrics. Starting with 1989&#x27;s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; album, John Frusciante and Flea have written nearly all of the music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his bandmates. Kiedis said in 2006, &quot;Somehow I find songs... in the bigness of what they&#x27;re doing.&quot; His lyrical style has varied over the years. During the band&#x27;s early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles. As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects. His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of Charles Bukowski, Kiedis&#x27; main literary influence.

His early vocal style with the band primarily consisted of rapping, leading him to be labelled as an influence on the rap rock movement. On &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; (1989), Kiedis wrote more melody-driven songs, rather than the basic rhythm and beat style of funk. The first song where Kiedis employed his new melodic style was &quot;Knock Me Down&quot;. The melody was actually shaped and performed by guitarist John Frusciante. Upon joining the band, Frusciante sang lead vocals on the song along with Kiedis. &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; in 1991 still saw Kiedis rapping, but he also started singing in songs such as &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot;, and &quot;I Could Have Lied&quot;. Over the years, Kiedis grew to favor singing over rapping. Kiedis has had many vocal coaches, but none of them had helped him sing &quot;well.&quot; In fact, it was not until 1999&#x27;s &quot;Californication&quot; that he felt he could take full control of his voice while singing.

===&quot;Scar Tissue&quot;===

On October 6, 2004, Kiedis published a memoir, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, which he co-wrote with author Larry Sloman. The book was originally intended to be a collection of stories of his childhood drug use, but evolved into a complete autobiography. He further explained: &quot;One would just kind of assume that with all the [drug] consumption that my memory would be a bit shoddy. But it&#x27;s actually pretty lucid, and better than both of my parents&#x27;, or any of my friends&#x27;. My friends tried to recount these same stories, and they were like, &#x27;Wow, I don&#x27;t ... were we there?&#x27;&quot; The book was an international bestseller.

In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis stated that he at first regretted writing &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; saying &quot;I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused—then, I started seeing the long term positive reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools, and it was having a positive effect. I realised that the whole point of writing that book wasn&#x27;t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.&quot; Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn&#x27;t read his book. &quot;I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book,&quot; Kiedis said.

===Television series and movie===
Kiedis was developing a series for HBO based on his unconventional upbringing in Los Angeles. The show was expected to be loosely based on much of Kiedis&#x27; autobiography. He had partnered with Catapult 360 partners Marc Abrams and Michael Benson to create the series, titled &quot;Spider and Son&quot;. The series would center on Kiedis&#x27;s relationship with his father, Blackie Dammett, who sold many drugs and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business. The show was scheduled to premiere in late 2010 at the very earliest.

According to a post by Blackie on his Facebook page, the John Sayles script for the pilot episode was turned over to HBO on May 10, 2010. On October 14, 2011, it was announced that HBO was no longer interested in the series and that FX has picked up the rights to air the series. John Sayles, who wrote a script for the HBO pilot is no longer involved in the project. &quot;Entourage&quot; producers, Esther Dawson and Mike Chester will still produce the series and Kiedis will also co-produce the series along with Bram Sheldon. It is unknown if the series will still follow the relationship between Kiedis and his father Blackie or if the entire autobiography will be the focus of the series. In 2013, Dammett briefly mentioned the status of the series, which will be based on both Kiedis and Dammett&#x27;s biographies, but stated that it was &quot;mothballed&quot; with hopes of resuming it once the Chili Peppers concluded their tour that year.

It was announced on January 17, 2024, that Universal Pictures will release a theatrical movie based on &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;. Kiedis along with Guy Oseary and Brian Grazer will produce the film. On September 27, 2024, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported that filming of the movie will begin in Atlanta in early 2025.

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
Kiedis&#x27;s father, Blackie Dammett, was an actor who appeared in over 50 movies and television shows. Dammett also ran the band&#x27;s fanclub for many years. Dammett&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Lords of the Sunset Strip&quot;, was released on March 31, 2013. Through Dammett, Kiedis also has a much younger half-brother. During the Chili Peppers show of June 25, 2017, in Grand Rapids, Kiedis dedicated &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot; to his father, who was suffering from dementia. Dammett died on May 12, 2021.

Kiedis acknowledges in his autobiography &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; that he had sexual relations with a 14-year-old girl when he was 23, before and after learning of her age, in the 1980s. This inspired him to write the song &quot;Catholic School Girls Rule&quot;. In the wake of the MeToo movement, the actions of Kiedis have been criticized by several media outlets, including &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

Kiedis claims to have had a brief relationship in 1990 with singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, who inspired him to write &quot;I Could Have Lied&quot; on 1991&#x27;s &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, though she denied the relationship at the time. He was also in a brief relationship with Spice Girls singer Melanie &quot;Sporty Spice&quot; Chisholm, who inspired &quot;Emit Remmus&quot; from 1999&#x27;s &quot;Californication&quot;. His band also covered their song &quot;Wannabe&quot; at a 1997 concert in Japan. Kiedis was in a relationship with fashion designer Yohanna Logan on-and-off from 1998 to 2003. Kiedis had a two year long relationship with Australian model Helena Vestergaard that ended in late 2014; the end of this relationship inspired much of Kiedis&#x27; lyricism for &quot;The Getaway.&quot;

Kiedis was in a relationship with Heather Christie from 2004 to 2008. They had a child born on October 2, 2007. In March 2018, Kiedis and Christie were involved in a custody battle.

In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis opened up about his past relationships, saying that there were years when he had over 100 sexual partners. Kiedis added, &quot;If I saw a pretty girl, I wanted to have her.&quot; When asked about marriage and growing old and alone, Kiedis responded, &quot;Maybe it is because I never learned to live in a relationship and as silly as it sounds, I do not understand women yet. They remain a mystery. I talked about this yesterday with a friend: do we focus on finding a person who fits with us, or will we remain single? I am open to both. If the right one comes – wonderful. If not, I accept what the universe has intended for me.&quot;

Kiedis is a longtime fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Rams, and formerly the Las Vegas Raiders. While attending a Lakers game on October 21, 2018, Kiedis was ejected after yelling and flashing his middle finger at Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul following a skirmish with then-Lakers guard Rajon Rondo.

===Drug addictions===
Kiedis has battled drug addiction, including heroin and cocaine, throughout his life. Since his father had more relaxed standards on drugs and experimented himself, Kiedis was constantly exposed to drug-using and drug-dealing behavior while growing up. Some of Kiedis&#x27;s early drug use came from substances he got from his father.

Kiedis used drugs for years, including during the formation of the band. A few years into the band&#x27;s career, he was briefly fired due to his heavy drug use. At times, it got so bad that he failed to show up to the band&#x27;s performances. One night, after Kiedis missed a performance to score drugs, the band replaced him with singer Keith Morris.

Kiedis tried to get clean after Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose on June 25, 1988, saying he would never shoot up again. He entered rehab and ended up staying clean for five years, but he relapsed in 1994, causing a major delay in the release of the band&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;One Hot Minute&quot;. Kiedis kept using on and off over the next six years.

Kiedis&#x27;s last major relapse occurred when a doctor prescribed him Tramadol despite Kiedis specifically asking not to be prescribed opiates. To a recovering heroin addict, synthetic opiates give rise to strong cravings. He has reportedly avoided another relapse since December 24, 2000. In May 2012, after over 20 years of speculation, &quot;Vulture&quot; claimed that the location where Kiedis would purchase and use drugs (which inspired &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;) is located in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, California, based on clues taken from Kiedis&#x27; memoir. In 2014, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; strongly insinuated that the conclusion of the &quot;Vulture&quot; magazine piece was incorrect.

===Feud with Mike Patton===

For over 30 years, Kiedis and Faith No More/Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton have been involved in an ongoing feud. Prior to that feud, Faith No More (then fronted by Chuck Mosley) and Red Hot Chili Peppers had toured together. However, tensions arose between the two bands in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley&#x27;s replacement, Patton, of imitating his mannerisms and image on stage and during the music video for their biggest hit, &quot;Epic&quot;. The two attacked each other in the media throughout 1990, including an interview in which Kiedis directly accused Patton of imitating him, claiming; &quot;My drummer [Chad Smith] says he&#x27;s gonna kidnap [Patton], shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he&#x27;ll be forced to find a style of his own&quot;.

The relationship was thought to have improved in the ensuing years, with Kiedis and Patton reportedly having friendly encounters with each other during the 1990s. The feud between the two was unexpectedly reignited in 1999. Mr. Bungle were scheduled to release their album &quot;California&quot; on June 8, 1999, but Warner Bros. Records pushed the release back a week so as not to coincide with the Chili Peppers&#x27; similarly titled album, &quot;Californication&quot;. Following the album release date clash, Mr. Bungle claimed that Kiedis had them removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe. Mr. Bungle&#x27;s guitarist, Trey Spruance, added that the manager of the Chili Peppers apologized and blamed Kiedis for the removals. In retaliation, Mr. Bungle parodied the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Pontiac, Michigan, on Halloween of 1999. They covered several of the band&#x27;s songs, with Patton deliberately using incorrect lyrics, such as &quot;Sometimes I feel like a fucking junkie&quot; on &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;. In the middle of the concert, bassist Trevor Dunn (dressed as Flea) walked up to guitarist Spruance (dressed as the ghost of Hillel Slovak) and simulated injecting him with heroin. Patton (dressed as Kiedis) interrupted this by shouting, &quot;You can&#x27;t shoot up a ghost&quot;. Kiedis responded by having them removed from the 2000 Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand. Kiedis said of the festival shows, &quot;I would not have given two fucks if they played there with us. But after I heard about [the] Halloween show where they mocked us, fuck him and fuck the whole band&quot;. Spruance later claimed that the parody was a retaliatory act towards Kiedis for having Mr. Bungle removed from several high-profile European festivals during the summer of 1999.

Patton continued to mock Kiedis in the media with his new band Fantômas, calling him a &quot;noodle-dick&quot; in a 2001 television interview. Despite the prior history, Patton would later express his desire to move beyond the feud, claiming he and Kiedis would have a warm embrace if the two ever met in person. Kiedis and the band would exhibit another possible gesture aimed at Patton during a concert in 2014 when the band jokingly teased the Faith No More song We Care a Lot during a performance at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance has also spoken highly of the first two Red Hot Chili Peppers albums during a 2016 interview, citing them as an influence on Mr. Bungle&#x27;s eventual sound.

Several publications, such as &quot;Complex&quot; and &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;, have since listed the Kiedis-Patton feud as being one of the best beefs in the history of rock. Others have labeled it as a &quot;funk metal feud&quot; and &quot;absurd&quot;.
