<text>Robert Adolph Wilton Morley (26 May 1908 – 3 June 1992) was an English actor who enjoyed a lengthy career in both Britain and the United States. He was frequently cast as a pompous English gentleman representing the Establishment, often in supporting roles. In 1939 he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of King Louis XVI in &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;.

In &quot;Movie Encyclopedia&quot;, film critic Leonard Maltin describes Morley as &quot;recognisable by his ungainly bulk, bushy eyebrows, thick lips and double chin, ... particularly effective when cast as a pompous windbag.&quot; Ephraim Katz in his &quot;International Film Encyclopaedia&quot; describes Morley as &quot;a rotund, triple-chinned, delightful character player of the British and American stage and screen.&quot; In his autobiography, &quot;Responsible Gentleman&quot;, Morley said his stage career started with managements valuing his appearance for playing &quot;substantial gentleman&quot; roles – as a doctor, lawyer, accountant or other professional member of society.

==Early life==
Morley was born in Semley, Wiltshire, England, the son of Gertrude Emily (née Fass) and Robert Wilton Morley, a major in the British Army. His mother came from a German family that had emigrated to South Africa. Morley attended Wellington College, Berkshire, which he hated, followed by RADA. As he was a famous &quot;Old Wellingtonian&quot;, generations of headmasters tried to contact him, without success, with Morley stating &quot;the only reason for me visiting Wellington would be to burn it down&quot;.

==Career==
Morley made his West End stage debut in 1929 in &quot;Treasure Island&quot; at the Strand Theatre and his Broadway debut in 1938 in the title role of &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; at the Fulton Theatre. Although soon won over to the big screen, Morley remained both a busy West End star and successful author, as well as appearing in touring productions.
A versatile actor, especially in his younger years, he played Louis XVI in &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (1938), for which he received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor.

He co-wrote several plays for the stage. His 1937 play &quot;Goodness, How Sad&quot; was turned into an Ealing Studios film, &quot;Return to Yesterday&quot; (1940), directed by Robert Stevenson. Later, he had outstanding success in London and New York with &quot;Edward, My Son&quot;, a gripping family drama written in 1947 in collaboration with Noel Langley. Morley played the central role of Arnold Holt. &quot;Edward, My Son&quot; (1949) was made into a movie by George Cukor for MGM-British. Morley&#x27;s acting career continued with roles as a missionary in &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), &quot;The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; (1953), as W. S. Gilbert, and in &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; (1960). In 1959 he appeared in an &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; adaptation of a Stanley Ellin short story entitled, &#x27;Specialty of the House&#x27;. In Ken Annakin&#x27;s &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot;, Morley is featured among an international ensemble cast including Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles, Terry-Thomas, James Fox, Red Skelton, Benny Hill, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gert Fröbe and Alberto Sordi. 

Morley also personified the conservative Englishman in many comedy and caper films. He was the face of BOAC (later British Airways) as the merry television commercial spokesman of the 1970s with &quot;We&#x27;ll take good care of you&quot; for British Airways. Later in his career, he received critical acclaim and numerous accolades for his performance in &quot;Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?&quot; 
During the 1980s, Morley hosted a celebrity cooking show on Cable TV, &quot;Celebrity Chefs&quot;. In 1980, Morley hosted (providing explanatory introductions) the 14-episode Granada Television anthology series &quot;Ladykillers&quot;.

He was renowned as a witty raconteur and for being an eloquent conversationalist, as well as a noted and enthusiastic gourmet, in real life and in various roles in film and TV.

Morley was honoured by being the first &quot;King of Moomba&quot; appointed by the Melbourne Moomba festival committee and, in typical humility, he accepted the crown in bare feet. Morley was in Australia touring his one-man show, &quot;The Sound of Morley&quot;.

In his book &quot;British Film Character Actors&quot;, Terence Pettigrew wrote: &quot;Morley, who has more wobbly chins than a Shanghai drinking club, enjoys poking fun at life&#x27;s absurdities, among whom he generously includes himself.&quot;

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1974 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

==Personal life and honours==
Robert Morley married Joan Buckmaster (1910–2005), a daughter of Dame Gladys Cooper. Their elder son, Sheridan Morley, became a writer and critic. They also had a daughter, Annabel, and another son, Wilton.

He was godfather to the eldest son of fellow actor Tom Chatto.

Morley was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1957 and was also offered a knighthood in 1975 but declined.

Morley lived for decades in Wargrave, Berkshire.

==Death==
Morley died in Reading, England, from a stroke aged 84 on 3 June 1992.

<text>Robert W. Young (May 18, 1912 – February 20, 2007), professor emeritus of linguistics at the University of New Mexico, was an American linguist known for his work on the Navajo language. From the late 1930s, Young cooperated with the Navajo linguist and scholar William Morgan, publishing a &quot;practical orthography&quot; in 1937.

From the 1940s through the 1950s, they published three major works, including &quot;The Navajo Language&quot; (1943), a compiled dictionary. That year Young and Morgan served as editors and began publication of &quot;Ádahooníłígíí,&quot; the first newspaper written in Navajo and the second Native American-language newspaper in the United States, after the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; of 1828–1834. Its publication contributed to standardization of Navajo orthography.

The men continued their work of analysis and documentation of Navajo; in 1980, 1987 they published &quot;The Navajo Language: A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary,&quot; representing &quot;a huge increase in descriptive coverage&quot; of the language. The 1987 edition included new appendices and grammar sections. It established itself as the major reference grammar of the Navajo language. Young, Morgan and Sally Midgette also produced the &quot;Analytical Lexicon of Navajo&quot; (1992), which re-organizes the lexicon by root, one of the principle elements in verbs and nouns of Athabaskan languages.

==Early life and education==
Robert Young was born in 1912 in Chicago, Illinois. He became interested in Native American languages, learning both the Spanish language and Nahuatl, an indigenous language, from Mexican immigrant railroad workers. After earning a liberal arts degree from the University of Illinois in 1935, he moved to New Mexico for Native American studies.

He enrolled in graduate school in anthropology at the University of New Mexico and began his study of Navajo. While working at the Southwestern Range and Sheepbreeding Laboratory in Fort Wingate, New Mexico, he became acquainted with William Morgan, a Navajo fellow worker and native of the city. Together in 1937 they published a practical orthography of Navajo.

==Career==
In the early 1940s Young joined the Bureau of Indian Affairs, where he worked in the Southwest at the Navajo Agency in Window Rock, Arizona. Morgan also joined the BIA, and the two worked together for decades on the Navajo language, making it the most documented indigenous language in the United States.

As a linguist, Young worked primarily on programs related to analyzing and expanding documentation of the Navajo language, encouraging its written use, and education in the language. He collaborated with Navajo scholar William Morgan on all his major projects. From the 1940s through the 1950s, they produced a variety of reading materials in Navajo, and three &quot;important works on lexicon and grammar.&quot; The first was a dictionary, &quot;The Navajo Language&quot; (1943), organized by root, as one of the principal elements in the verbs of the Athabaskan languages.

In 1943 Young and Morgan became editors of the first Navajo-language newspaper, &quot;Ádahooníłígíí&quot;, published by the Navajo Agency. It was the second newspaper to be published in a Native American language, after the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot;, which was founded in 1828 and published through 1834 (it was revived intermittently and began regular publication again in the late 20th century, including online). The newspaper &quot;Ádahooníłígíí&quot; was published through the late 1950s.

Their work was interrupted by World War II. Young served a stint in the Marine Corps and during this period, he worked on the Navajo Code Talker project. They developed a code based on the Navajo language for high-level communications. Navajo-speaking soldiers were recruited for such communications of intelligence, and no enemy was ever able to break this code.

Returning to the BIA, Young continued to work with Morgan and other Navajo. They published &quot;The Function and Significance of Certain Navajo Particles&quot; (1948) and &quot;A Vocabulary of Colloquial Navajo&quot; (1951), which was an English to Navajo dictionary. They also published &quot;Navajo Historical Selections&quot; (1954), Phoenix: Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Upon his retirement from the BIA in 1971, Young became an adjunct professor of Linguistics at the University of New Mexico. He continued his work with Morgan, until Morgan&#x27;s death. In 1980 and 1987, they published &quot;The Navajo Language: A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary&quot; (&quot;TNL&quot;), representing &quot;a huge increase in descriptive coverage&quot; of the language.

The 1987 edition of &quot;TNL&quot; is the primary reference grammar of Navajo. Young, Morgan and Sally Midgette also produced the &quot;Analytical Lexicon of Navajo&quot; (1992), organizes the lexicon by roots and stems, one of the primary elements in the verbs of the language.

==Discussion of works==
*&quot;The Navajo Language&quot; edition of 1943 was organized by root, a highly salient elements in nouns and verbs of the language. In a 1974 survey, Navajos requested a dictionary organized by word, as it reflected their own knowledge of the language.
*Young and Morgan achieved this in the 1980 and 1987 editions of, &quot;The Navajo Language: A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary.&quot; The later volume consists of a 437-page grammar, with appendices, followed by a separately numbered Navajo-English, English-Navajo dictionary (pp. 1–1069). The grammar section is primarily concerned with the structure of the verbs. Verbs are productive and are the most complex elements in the language (the coverage of the Navajo nouns consists of 8 pages (1–8) in the grammar). The grammar section ends with 8 Appendices, beginning with the Appendix I: Model Paradigms, a listing of the Base and Extended Paradigms, laying the out conjugation patterns of the mode/subject morphemes. These paradigms play an important role in the dictionary entries. In the dictionary section, the entries are fully inflected words, given in the first person imperfective form of the word as the default form. Each entry is referenced to the paradigms, or conjugations, that the word inflects in, thus demonstrating the inflectional system for that entry.
*&quot;Analytical Lexicon of Navajo&quot; (1992) is organized by the roots/stems, in response to the requests of linguists and non-native Navajo speakers. Young published &quot;The Navajo Verb System: An Overview&quot; (2000), after Morgan&#x27;s death.

==Legacy and honors==
In July 1996, Robert Young and William Morgan were honored in the Navajo Nation Council Chambers for their work on the Navajo language. The two were presented with Pendleton blankets embroidered with the seal of the Navajo Nation by members of the Navajo Language Academy, including Paul Platero, Ellavina Perkins, Alyse Neundorf, and MaryAnn Willie. The Academy was founded that year and formally incorporated in 1999, to train teachers in scientific study of the Navajo language. In January 2006, the Linguistic Society of America honored Robert Young, then 93, at their Annual Meeting, presenting him with the Kenneth Hale Award, stating: &quot;&quot;The Navajo Language&quot; is remarkable for its structure and the robustness of its documentation. It’s two key parts, a grammar with appendices and a dictionary, interrelated by an ingenious system of cross-referencing. Because Navajo is a polysynthetic language with a rich verbal morphology, a fully inflected word is a complex entity. In accordance with the wishes of native speakers, the dictionary entries are fully inflected form; each word is capable of being inflected in a number of different ways, determined by use and by principles that are not entirely understood. Their system links the dictionary entries to the conjugation and paradigm patterns that that particular word may appear in, thus reflecting a native speaker’s knowledge and providing a map of morpheme distribution and co-occurrence restrictions. The dictionary thus stands as an implemented model of a polysynthetic lexicon, while at the same time providing robust documentation of the language. In addition to this, each and every entry contains examples of the inflected word, as it is used, in full utterances, effectively presenting an etymology of a given word, as well as documentation of the Navajo language as it was spoken in the mid-twentieth century.&quot;

The University of New Mexico Department of Linguistics established a scholarship in Young&#x27;s honor, available for students who study Native American languages.

Young died on February 20, 2007, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

<doc id="319240" wikidata="Q2032353" url="?curid=319240" title="A Child's History of England">
<text>A Child&#x27;s History of England is a book by English author Charles Dickens. It first appeared in serial form in &quot;Household Words&quot;, running from 25 January 1851 to 10 December 1853. Dickens also published the work in book form in three volumes: the first volume on 20 December 1851, the second on 25 December 1852 and the third on 24 December 1853. Although the volumes were published in December, each was postdated the following year. They bore the titles:

* Volume I – England from the Ancient Times, to the Death of King John (1852)
* Volume II – England from the Reign of Henry the Third, to the Reign of Richard the Third (1853)
* Volume III – England from the Reign of Henry the Seventh to the Revolution of 1688 (1854)

Dickens dedicated the book to &quot;My own dear children, whom I hope it may help, bye and bye, to read with interest larger and better books on the same subject.&quot; The history covered the period between 50 BC and 1689, ending with a short chapter summarising events from 1689 until the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. In a letter to his friend Douglas William Jerrold, Dickens confessed that he was composing the book so that he could prevent his children from embracing conservatism:

I am writing a little history of England for my boy ... For I don&#x27;t know what I should do if he were to get hold of any conservative or High Church notions; and the best way of guarding against any such horrible result is, I take it, to wring the parrot&#x27;s neck in his very cradle.

&quot;A Child&#x27;s History&quot; was included in the curricula of British schoolchildren well into the 20th century, with successive editions published from 1851 to World War II.

<doc id="319241" wikidata="Q5589368" url="?curid=319241" title="Government of the 24th Dáil">
<text>The 19th government of Ireland (14 December 1982 – 10 March 1987) was the government of Ireland formed after the November 1982 general election to the 24th Dáil. It was a coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party led by Garret FitzGerald as Taoiseach and lasted for .

==Nomination of Taoiseach==
The 24th Dáil first met on 14 December 1982. In the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil leader and outgoing Taoiseach Charles Haughey, and Fine Gael leader Garret FitzGerald were both proposed. The nomination of Haughey was defeated with 77 votes in favour to 88 against, while the nomination of FitzGerald was carried with 85 in favour and 79 against. FitzGerald was then appointed as Taoiseach by president Patrick Hillery.

==Government ministers==
After his appointment as Taoiseach by the president, Garret FitzGerald proposed the members of the government and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.

;Notes
==Attorney General==
On 14 December 1982, Peter Sutherland SC was appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach. He resigned as Attorney General on 12 December 1984 on his nomination as European Commissioner. On 13 December 1984, John Rogers SC was appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach.

==Ministers of state==
On 14 December 1982, the Government on the nomination of the Taoiseach appointed Seán Barrett to the post of Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip. On 16 December 1982, the Government appointed the other Ministers of State on the nomination of the Taoiseach.

==Confidence in the government==
After the February 1986 reshuffle, including the failure of FitzGerald to move Barry Desmond from the Department of Health and having misinformed the Dáil about the resignation of ministers of state who were subsequently sacked, Charles Haughey sought to move a motion of no confidence in the government. This was debated as a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach, proposed by Tánaiste Dick Spring. The motion of confidence was carried on 21 February 1986 by a vote of 82 to 77.

In June 1986, Joseph Bermingham had resigned from the Labour Party, leaving the coalition parties in a minority. In October 1986, moved a motion of no confidence in the government. This was debated as a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and the government, proposed by Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald. The motion of confidence was carried on 23 October 1986 by a vote of 83 to 81. Bermingham voted with the government; Seán Treacy, who had resigned from Labour in February 1985, voted with the opposition.

==Government policy==

The &quot;republican crusade&quot; flagged by Garret Fitzgerald when he was previously in government in 1981 was progressed with some changes in policy on Northern Ireland and social issues.

===Economics===
The government resorted to high marginal tax rates to curb the national debt, which had increased when spending commitments accrued under the 1977–81 government&#x27;s expansion of the public sector became unsustainable after the 1979 energy crisis. High taxes and high unemployment brought a return to high net emigration, a long-established Irish flow which had temporarily reversed in the 1970s. An economic policy document, &quot;Building on reality&quot;, was published in 1984.

===Constitutional referendums===
The Eighth Amendment to recognise the right to life of the unborn had been proposed by the previous government. It was adopted by the FitzGerald government, but not supported by Labour. An attempt to amend the wording was unsuccessful. The amendment was approved in a referendum in September 1983.

The Ninth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland permitted legislation to allow non-Irish citizens to vote in Dáil elections.

A referendum to ease the ban on divorce was defeated in 1986.

===Contraception===
A bill to ease restrictions on contraception was passed in 1985. The failure of Desmond O&#x27;Malley to vote against this legislation led to his expulsion from Fianna Fáil. O&#x27;Malley later established the Progressive Democrats in December 1985.

===Northern Ireland===
The government&#x27;s New Ireland Forum was a prelude to the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed in 1985.

<doc id="319244" wikidata="Q716799" url="?curid=319244" title="Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo">
<text>Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo (; 3 November 1856 – 19 May 1912) was a Spanish scholar, historian and literary critic. Even though his main interest was the history of ideas, and Hispanic philology in general, he also cultivated poetry, translation and philosophy. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.

==Biography==
He was born at Santander where he showed that he was an infant prodigy. His brother said in his memoirs that at the age of twelve he translated Virgil without a dictionary and read the &quot;History of England&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith. At only 15, he studied literature under Manuel Milà i Fontanals at the University of Barcelona (1871–1872), then proceeded to the central University of Madrid. His academic success was unprecedented; a special law was passed by the &quot;Cortes&quot; to enable him to become a professor at 22. Three years later, in 1880, he was elected a member of the Real Academia Española, but he was already well known throughout Spain.

His first volume, &quot;Estudios críticos sobre escritores montañeses&quot; (1876), had attracted little notice at first. He then produced his scholarly investigation &quot;Horacio en España&quot; (1877), an analysis of Horace&#x27;s translations in Spanish literature, with a prologue by the prominent critic Juan Valera. He became famous through his &quot;Ciencia española&quot; (1878), a collection of essays vindicating the existence of a scientific tradition in Spain. The orthodoxy of this work is even more noticeable in the &quot;Historia de los heterodoxos españoles&quot; (1880–1886), and the writer was hailed as the champion of the Ultramontane party. As the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1908–10) described his work, &quot;Every page of his writings reveals a wealth of strong common sense, clear perception, and a vein of wonderful and ever varying erudition. Thoroughly Catholic in spirit, he found his greatest delight, he declared, in devoting all his work to the glory of God and the exaltation of the name of Jesus&quot;.

His lectures (1881) on Calderón established his reputation as a literary critic. His work as an historian of Spanish literature was continued in his &quot;Historia de las ideas estéticas en España&quot; (&quot;History of aesthetic ideas in Spain&quot;) (1883-1891), which are five volumes in which he explores, summarizes and reinterprets the existing bibliography on literary and artistic aesthetics at different times of the Spanish cultural tradition.

He undertook the publication of the works of Lope de Vega (1890-1902) in 13 volumes. Another tremendous work was his Anthology of Castilian Lyric Poets (1890-1908), again 13 volumes devoted to medieval poetry (except the last one, dedicated to Juan Boscán Almogáver). He also devoted much time to his &quot;Orígenes de la novela&quot; (&quot;The origins of the novel&quot;), three volumes published in 1905, 1907 and 1910, with a fourth posthumous volume where he examined the imitations that &quot;La Celestina&quot; gave rise to in the 16th century. Simultaneously, he published the Anthology of Hispano-American Poets (1893-1895), 4 volumes that are actually a History of Hispano-American poetry as he titled it when reissuing it in 1911. Although some of his judgments, mainly those related to the defense of Spanish tradition, are no longer accepted, his studies of Spanish literature (Medieval, Renaissance, and Golden Age) are still valuable.

He died at Santander. He is buried in Santander Cathedral, where his monument may still be seen.

== Disciples ==
Among his many disciples can be mentioned: Ludwig Pfandl, German Hispanist and biographer of many important Spanish historical figures; Ramón Menéndez Pidal, founder of Hispanic philology as a scientific discipline; Adolfo Bonilla y San Martín, editor of the &quot;Obras completas&quot; of Miguel de Cervantes, among other works; and José María Sánchez Muniaín, chair of Aesthetics at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, who compiled the &quot;Antología general de Menéndez Pelayo&quot;.

== Summary of important works ==
&quot;La ciencia española&quot; (1876) is a claim of the existence of a scientific tradition in Spain. &quot;Horacio en España&quot; (1877) is an analysis of the translations of Horace in Spanish literature, according to Horace&#x27;s classical dispositions. His work &quot;Historia de los heterodoxos españoles&quot; (1880–1882) is particularly famous and valued today especially where the Christian traditions of Spain are studied. From the Middle Ages to the ending of the 19th century, he breaks down the work of all the thinkers and writers persecuted by the Spanish Catholic traditions, taking the perspective of Catholicism. In his second edition he corrected some of his perspectives, but not, for example, his jests and ironies against the Krausists and the Hegelianists, especially Emilio Castelar. &quot;Historia de las ideas estéticas en España&quot; (1883–1891) is five volumes long and very up to date. They explore, summarize, and reinterpret the existing bibliography about literary esthetics and artistics in distinct eras of the Spanish cultural tradition.

Menéndez Pelayo took on three large works that would keep him occupied almost until the time of his death. One is the publication of &quot;Obras de Lope de Vega&quot; (1890–1902), written in 13 volumes; the second is the &quot;Antología de poetas líricos castellanos&quot; (1890–1908), another 13 volumes dedicated to medieval poetry, except for the last, dedicated to Juan Boscán. As well, despite its title, it includes epic poetry along with didactic poetry, changing &quot;Antología&quot; instead to &quot;Historia de la poesía castellana en la Edad Media&quot;, the title of the reprint in 1911. The third work is his study of &quot;Orígenes de la novela&quot;, three volumes published in 1905, 1907, and 1910, with a fourth, posthumous, volume in which he analyzes the imitations that gave place in the 16th century for La Celestina. He published simultaneously a four volume work called &quot;Antología de poetas hispano-americanos&quot; (1893–1895), which in reality is &quot;Historia de la poesía hispanoamerica&quot;, as it was titled in the 1911 reedit. He corrected in this edition his appreciations of Peru, after having contact with Marqués de Montealegre de Aulestia. The 1911 edition is a general study of all Hispanic-American poetry which served to flatter the ex-colonies with the old and decadent peninsula.

<text>Manuel Milà i Fontanals (; May 4, 1818 – July 16, 1884) was a Spanish scholar. He was born at Vilafranca del Penedès, near Barcelona, and was educated first in Barcelona, and afterwards at the University of Cervera.

In 1845, he became professor of literature at the University of Barcelona, and held this post until his death at Vilafranca del Penedès on the July 16, 1884. The type of the scholarly recluse, Milà i Fontanals was almost unknown outside the walls of the university until 1859, when he was appointed president of the &quot;jocs florals&quot; at Barcelona.

On the publication of his treatise, &quot;De Los trovadores en España&quot; (1866), his merits became more generally recognized, and his monograph, &quot;De la poesía heróico-popular castellana&quot; (1873) revealed him to foreign scholars as a master of scientific method. He brought the chivalric romance &quot;Curial e Güelfa&quot; to scholarly notice in 1876.

<doc id="319252" wikidata="Q2356294" url="?curid=319252" title="Strict function">
<text>In computer science and computer programming, a function f is said to be strict if, when applied to a non-terminating expression, it also fails to terminate. A strict function in the denotational semantics of programming languages is a function &quot;f&quot; where formula_1. The entity formula_2, called &quot;bottom&quot;, denotes an expression that does not return a normal value, either because it loops endlessly or because it aborts due to an error such as division by zero. A function that is not strict is called non-strict. A strict programming language is one in which user-defined functions are always strict.

Intuitively, non-strict functions correspond to control structures. Operationally, a strict function is one that always evaluates its argument; a non-strict function is one that might not evaluate some of its arguments. Functions having more than one parameter can be strict or non-strict in each parameter independently, as well as &quot;jointly strict&quot; in several parameters simultaneously.

As an example, the codice_1 expression of many programming languages, called codice_2 in languages inspired by C, may be thought of as a function of three parameters. This function is strict in its first parameter, since the function must know whether its first argument evaluates to true or to false before it can return; but it is non-strict in its second parameter, because (for example) codice_3, as well as non-strict in its third parameter, because (for example) codice_4. However, it is jointly strict in its second and third parameters, since codice_5 and codice_6.

In a non-strict functional programming language, strictness analysis refers to any algorithm used to prove the strictness of a function with respect to one or more of its arguments. Such functions can be compiled to a more efficient calling convention, such as call by value, without changing the meaning of the enclosing program.

<text>The 6 Lexington Avenue Local and &lt;6&gt; Pelham Bay Park Express are two rapid transit services in the A Division of the New York City Subway. Their route emblems, or &quot;bullets&quot;, are colored since they use the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in Manhattan. Local service is denoted by a (6) in a circular bullet, and express service is denoted by a &lt;6&gt; in a green diamond-shaped bullet. On the R62A rolling stock, this is often indicated by LEDs around the service logo to indicate local or express service to riders. The LEDs illuminate in a green circle pattern for 6 local trains and in a red diamond pattern for &lt;6&gt; trains.

The 6 operates 24 hours a day between Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx and Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall in Lower Manhattan, making all stops in Manhattan. Additional service short turns at Parkchester in the Bronx during weekday rush hours and middays and does not operate to or from Pelham Bay Park; during this time, 6 trains that originate and terminate at Parkchester makes all stops in the Bronx, while trains that serve the full route makes express stops in the Bronx between Parkchester and Third Avenue–138th Street in the peak direction and are labeled as &lt;6&gt; Express trains; when the &lt;6&gt; Express is not running, 6 trains originate and terminate at Pelham Bay Park and makes all stops in the Bronx.

The 6 in its current format has run since the implementation of the IRT &quot;H&quot; system in 1918. Since 1920, it has remained largely unchanged, running between Pelham Bay Park and City Hall with a peak-express variant in the Bronx. In 1945, the city closed the City Hall Loop station, the 6 former southern terminal in Manhattan. Since then, most 6 trains have terminated at Brooklyn Bridge, with a few exceptions in later years.
, the 6 was the busiest route in the subway system, carrying around 140 million passengers.

== History ==

=== Under the Interborough Rapid Transit ===
On October 27, 1904, local and express service opened on the original subway in Manhattan, following the route of the present IRT Lexington Avenue Line from City Hall to Grand Central–42nd Street. From there, the service traveled west on 42nd Street on the route of the present 42nd Street Shuttle, and then north on the present IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to 145th Street.

The current &quot;H&quot; configuration, with separate services along Lexington Avenue and Broadway/Seventh Avenue, was introduced in 1917. Full Lexington Avenue local service from City Hall to 125th Street opened on July 17, 1918. Local service was extended to Third Avenue–138th Street on August 1, 1918.

On January 7, 1919, trains were extended from 138th Street to Hunts Point Avenue, and to East 177th Street on May 30, 1920. Service between Hunts Point Avenue and East 177th Street was originally served by a shuttle service operating with elevated cars.

On October 24, 1920, service was extended again to Westchester Square. On December 20, 1920, service was extended to Pelham Bay Park. Service to Pelham Bay Park was served by a mix of through and shuttle trains during the 1920s.

On December 21, 1925, the number of Manhattan-bound through trains in the morning rush hour, between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m., was increased from thirteen to eighteen; a 38 percent increase in service. The remainder of trains continued operating as a shuttle service to Hunts Point Avenue.

On January 28, 1931, two southbound morning rush hour trips began starting at Pelham Bay Park instead of Hunts Point Avenue. On April 13, 1931, service to Pelham Bay Park was increased. Two additional southbound trips were added, starting at Pelham Bay Park at 5:50 and 6:10 a.m., reducing headways from ten to five minutes. Four northbound trips that terminated at Hunts Point Avenue between 3:53 and 5:05 p.m. were extended to Pelham Bay Park, reducing headways from nine to six minutes, and four northbound trips terminating at Third Avenue-138th Street between 3:36 and 4:48 p.m. were extended to Hunts Point Avenue, reducing headways from to 3 minutes.

By 1934, service south of the City Hall station had been discontinued and late-night service ran from Pelham Bay Park to 125th Street only, being replaced by local service on the 4, which had previously run express.

=== Under the New York City Board of Transportation ===
Effective December 31, 1945, City Hall station closed with the former Brooklyn Bridge station (renamed to Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall) being the permanent southern terminal. However, the 6 train still uses the loop to get from the southbound to the northbound local track at Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall.

On May 10, 1946, late-night service was extended from 125th Street to its previous terminus at Brooklyn Bridge when late-night express service on the 4 was restored.

Beginning October 14, 1946, weekday rush and Saturday morning rush peak direction express service started, with Pelham Bay trains using the middle track between East 177th Street and Third Avenue–138th Street. This express service saved eight minutes between Third Avenue and East 177th Street. During this time, 6 trains that ran local in the Bronx when express trains operated began to terminate at East 177 Street to make room for express trains to Pelham Bay Park. On March 7, 1949, the hours of the evening Bronx-bound express service were advanced from 4:30 to 3:30 p.m., and on June 17, 1949, the hours of the morning Manhattan-bound express service were extended from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m.

On September 22, 1948, 54 additional cars were placed in service on the 6 train, increasing the lengths of trains from six cars to seven cars.

The New York City Board of Transportation, predecessor to the New York City Transit Authority, began to introduce replacements to older subway cars beginning with the R12 cars in 1948. With these cars, numbers were publicly designated to the former IRT lines. Lexington–Pelham trains were assigned the number 6. By 1964, all cars had the route numbers on them.

From December 15 to 22, 1950, the weekday rush hour trains from Pelham Bay Park were extended to South Ferry.

=== Under the New York City Transit Authority ===
On June 23, 1956, Saturday morning express service began operating local. On March 1, 1960, late-night express service on the 4 was suspended when the 4 and 6 ran local in Manhattan together. On April 8, 1960, late-night and weekend evening trains were extended to South Ferry. On October 17, 1965, late-night 4 service began running express once again, and weekend evening 6 service was extended to South Ferry. Trains were cut back from South Ferry to Brooklyn Bridge on May 23, 1976.

Beginning on January 13, 1980, late-night service terminated at 125th Street in Manhattan with the again making all stops south of there. This service cut affected 15,000 riders and was criticized by Manhattan Borough President Andrew Stein as no public hearing was held. On the same day, Bronx express service was expanded to operate during middays, with Pelham Bay trains running express in the peak direction to Brooklyn Bridge in the morning and to Pelham Bay Park in the afternoon.

From March to May 1985, one weekday morning rush hour train was extended to Atlantic Avenue, terminated there, and returned in service to Pelham Bay Park. This service change was made due to track reconstruction taking place at Penn Station at the time, which forced some Long Island Rail Road trains to be diverted from Penn Station to Atlantic Terminal (then known as Flatbush Avenue), disrupting service for passengers; as a result, morning rush hour service on the routes serving the Lexington Avenue Line was increased in order to transport LIRR passengers who took diverted trains to Flatbush Avenue to reach Manhattan.

From January 21 to October 5, 1990, late-night service was extended back to Brooklyn Bridge when late-night express service on the 4 was restored. But the 6 was then cut back to 125th Street for the last time when late-night express service on the 4 in Manhattan was permanently discontinued.

Effective October 3, 1999, the 4 and 6 trains once again began to operate local together in Manhattan late nights when the 6 train was permanently extended back to Brooklyn Bridge.

In August 2023, weekend headways on the 6 were reduced from eight to six minutes.

Until the timetable in effect on December 15, 2024, Weekdays from 9:00 to 11:00 a.m., select Manhattan-bound &lt;6&gt; trains ran local from Parkchester to Hunts Point Avenue while select Parkchester-bound 6 trains ran express in that section. After this date, all Manhattan-bound &lt;6&gt; trains ran express and all Parkchester-bound 6 trains ran local in this section.

<text>The 14th government of Ireland (14 March 1973 – 5 July 1977) was the government of Ireland formed after the 1973 general election to the 20th Dáil held on 28 February 1973. It was a coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, known as the National Coalition, led by Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach with Brendan Corish as Tánaiste. It was the first time either of the parties had been in government since the second inter-party government (1954–1957), when they were in coalition with Clann na Talmhan. It lasted for . The government was widely referred to as the &quot;cabinet of all the talents&quot;.

==Nomination of Taoiseach==
The 20th Dáil first met on 14 March 1973. In the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil leader and outgoing Taoiseach Jack Lynch, and Fine Gael leader Liam Cosgrave were both proposed. The nomination of Lynch was defeated with 69 votes in favour to 73 against, while the nomination of Cosgrave was carried with 72 in favour and 70 against. Cosgrave was appointed as Taoiseach by President Éamon de Valera.

==Members of the government==
After his appointment as Taoiseach by the president, Liam Cosgrave proposed the members of the government and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.
;Changes to departments
==Attorney General==
On 14 March 1973, Declan Costello SC was appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach. On 19 May 1977, Costello resigned as Attorney General on his nomination by the government for appointment as a judge of the High Court and John M. Kelly SC was appointed as Attorney General.

==Parliamentary Secretaries==
On 14 March 1973, the government appointed parliamentary secretaries on the nomination of the Taoiseach.
==Actions of the government==
The National Coalition restricted the power of the National Council for Educational Awards. This forced the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick and Thomond College of Education, Limerick to apply to the National University of Ireland for the conferring of degrees and diplomas. It removed the requirement that Irish be passed to obtain a Leaving Certificate; it also reformed the civil service by removing the requirement of knowledge in Irish and the mandatory retirement on marriage that many women faced during their civil service careers.

A free travel scheme was also introduced covering bus and rail services for all blind persons over the age of 21.

In response to the assassination of the British Ambassador to Ireland Christopher Ewart-Biggs by the Provisional IRA on 21 July, Cosgrave introduced a motion to declare a national emergency under Article 28.3.3° of the Constitution of Ireland created by an armed conflict. This was approved by the Dáil on 1 September by a vote of 70 to 65. This was followed by the introduction of the Emergency Powers Bill 1976.

President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh referred the Emergency Powers Bill to the Supreme Court. Minister of Defence Paddy Donegan described the president as a &quot;thundering disgrace&quot; for this decision. The Minister apologised and privately offered to resign. Cosgrave refused to accept his resignation. On 21 October, Fianna Fáil proposed a motion in the Dáil calling on the minister to resign, which was defeated. Ó Dálaigh viewed the refusal to remove the minister as an affront to his office by the government and resigned on 22 October 1976. The following week, Fianna Fáil proposed a motion of no confidence in the government. This was countered by a motion of confidence in the government proposed by Cosgrave, which was carried on a vote of 73 to 67.

<text>There were two governments of the 16th Dáil, which was elected at the 1957 general election held on 5 March. The outgoing minority coalition government of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Clann na Talmhan had failed to be returned. The 8th government of Ireland (20 March 1957 – 23 June 1959) was led by Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach, until his election as president of Ireland at the 1959 election. It lasted for from its appointment until de Valera&#x27;s resignation on 17 June 1959, and continued to carry out its duties for a further 6 days until the appointment of its successor, giving a total of . The 9th government of Ireland (23 June 1959 – 11 November 1961) was led by Seán Lemass as Taoiseach and lasted for . Both were single-party Fianna Fáil governments.

==8th government of Ireland==
===Nomination of Taoiseach===
The 16th Dáil first met on 20 March 1957. In the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil leader Éamon de Valera was proposed and this motion was carried with 78 votes in favour and 53 votes against. De Valera was appointed as Taoiseach by President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly.

===Members of the Government===
After his appointment as Taoiseach by the president, Éamon de Valera proposed the members of the government and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.
===Parliamentary Secretaries===
On 21 March 1957, the Government appointed the Parliamentary Secretaries on the nomination of the Taoiseach.
===Confidence in the government===
On 29 October 1958, William Norton, leader of the Labour Party, tabled a vote of no confidence in the government. James Dillon and Liam Cosgrave of Fine Gael proposed an amendment to the motion. Both the amendment and the motion were defeated the following day on a vote of 54 to 71.

===Constitutional referendum===
The government proposed the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1958, which would have altered the electoral system from proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote to first past the post. It was put to a referendum on 17 June 1959, the same date as the presidential election. It was defeated by a margin of 48.2% to 51.8% of votes cast.

===Resignation===
On 17 June 1959, Éamon de Valera was elected as president of Ireland and he resigned as Taoiseach on that day. Under Article 28.11 of the Constitution, all members of the government are deemed to have resigned on the resignation of the Taoiseach, but they continued to carry on their duties until the appointment of their successors.

==9th government of Ireland==

Éamon de Valera resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil after his election as president of Ireland and Seán Lemass was elected unopposed to succeed him on 22 June 1959.

===Nomination of Taoiseach===
On 23 June 1959, in the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil leader Seán Lemass was proposed. This motion was carried with 75 votes in favour to 51 votes against. Lemass was appointed as Taoiseach by President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly. It was the first time there was a change of Taoiseach within a Dáil term.

===Members of the Government===
After his appointment as Taoiseach by the president, Seán Lemass proposed the members of the government and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on 24 June 1959.

===Parliamentary Secretaries===
On 24 June 1959, the government appointed the Parliamentary Secretaries on the nomination of the Taoiseach.

<text>The 5th government of Ireland (18 February 1948 – 13 June 1951), commonly known as the First inter-party government, was formed after the 1948 general election held to the 13th Dáil on 4 February. It was an Irish government of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and the National Labour Party—and one TD who was an independent, James Dillon (who had resigned from Fine Gael after opposing Ireland&#x27;s neutrality in World War II). The parties had many different aims and viewpoints, but opposition to Fianna Fáil overcame difficulties in forming a government; Éamon de Valera had led a series of single-party Fianna Fáil governments since 1932. The cabinet was made up of representatives of all parties, and ministers were given a great degree of independence. Some key events during the lifetime of the government include the declaration of the Republic of Ireland in 1948 and the crisis surrounding the Mother and Child Scheme in 1951. It lasted for .

== Formation ==
Fianna Fáil had been in office continuously since 1932, with Éamon de Valera as head of government (titled as President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State until 1937, and from then as Taoiseach). However, after the 1948 general election, the party was six seats short of a majority.

At first, it seemed that de Valera would attempt to form a minority government. Negotiations for confidence and supply with the National Labour Party failed when National Labour insisted on a formal coalition; at that time, Fianna Fáil would not enter coalitions with other parties. Nevertheless, it initially appeared that Fianna Fáil was the only party that could realistically form a government. Even though it was short of a majority, Fianna Fáil was by far the largest party in the Dáil, with 37 more seats than the next-largest party, Fine Gael.

However, the other parties realised that between them, they only had only one seat fewer than Fianna Fáil, and if they worked together, they could form a government with the support of at least seven independents. As the second-largest party in the Dáil, it was a foregone conclusion that Fine Gael would head such a coalition. In the normal course of events, Fine Gael leader Richard Mulcahy would have been the prospective coalition&#x27;s nominee for Taoiseach. However, Clann na Poblachta leader Seán MacBride refused to serve under Mulcahy because of his role in carrying out 77 executions under the government of the Irish Free State in the early 1920s during the Irish Civil War. Accordingly, Mulcahy bowed out in favour of former Attorney General John A. Costello. Costello found himself as leader of a disparate group of young and old politicians, republicans and Free Staters, conservatives and socialists. The government survived for three years, however, through the skill of Costello as Taoiseach and the independence of various ministers.

==Nomination of Taoiseach==
The 13th Dáil first met on 18 February 1948. In the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil leader and outgoing Taoiseach Éamon de Valera and John A. Costello of Fine Gael were both proposed. The nomination of de Valera was defeated by 70 to 75, while the nomination of Costello was approved by 75 to 68. Costello was appointed as Taoiseach by President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly.

==Members of the Government==
The Ministers of the Government were proposed by the Taoiseach and approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.

==Parliamentary Secretaries==
On 24 February 1948, the Government appointed the Parliamentary Secretaries on the nomination of the Taoiseach.
==Republic of Ireland==
The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 was enacted on 21 December 1948. It repealed the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936, removing any remaining external function of the British monarchy in Ireland. It also declared that the description of the state was the Republic of Ireland. The Act came into operation on Easter Monday, 18 April 1949.

<doc id="319275" wikidata="Q418939" url="?curid=319275" title="Heat shock protein">
<text>Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins produced by cells in response to exposure to stressful conditions. They were first described in relation to heat shock, but are now known to also be expressed during other stresses including exposure to cold, UV light and during wound healing or tissue remodeling. Many members of this group perform chaperone functions by stabilizing new proteins to ensure correct folding or by helping to refold proteins that were damaged by the cell stress. This increase in expression is transcriptionally regulated. The dramatic upregulation of the heat shock proteins is a key part of the heat shock response and is induced primarily by heat shock factor (HSF). HSPs are found in virtually all living organisms, from bacteria to humans.

Heat shock proteins are named according to their molecular weight. For example, Hsp60, Hsp70 and Hsp90 (the most widely studied HSPs) refer to families of heat shock proteins on the order of 60, 70 and 90 kilodaltons in size, respectively. The small 8-kilodalton protein ubiquitin, which marks proteins for degradation, also has features of a heat shock protein. A conserved protein binding domain of approximately 80 amino-acid alpha crystallins are known as small heat shock proteins (sHSP).

==Discovery==
It is known that rapid heat hardening can be elicited by a brief exposure of cells to sub-lethal high temperature, which in turn provides protection from subsequent and more severe temperature. In 1962, Italian geneticist Ferruccio Ritossa reported that heat and the metabolic uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol induced a characteristic pattern of &quot;puffing&quot; in the chromosomes of Drosophila. This discovery eventually led to the identification of the heat-shock proteins (HSP) or stress proteins whose expression this puffing represented. Increased synthesis of selected proteins in Drosophila cells following stresses such as heat shock was first reported in 1974. In 1974, Tissieres, Mitchell and Tracy discovered that heat-shock induces the production of a small number of proteins and inhibits the production of most others. This initial biochemical finding gave rise to a large number of studies on the induction of heat shock and its biological role. Heat shock proteins often function as chaperones in the refolding of proteins damaged by heat stress. Heat shock proteins have been found in all species examined, from bacteria to humans, suggesting that they evolved very early and have an important function.

== Function ==
According to Marvin et al. sHSPs independently express not only in heat shock response but also have developmental roles in embryonic or juvenile stages of mammals, teleost fish and some lower vertebral genomes. hspb1 (HSP27) is expressed during stress and during the development of embryo, somites, mid-hindbrain, heart and lens in zebrafish. Expression of the hspb4 gene, which codes for alpha crystallin, increases considerably in the lens in response to heat shock.

=== Upregulation in stress ===
Production of high levels of heat shock proteins can also be triggered by exposure to different kinds of environmental stress conditions, such as infection, inflammation, exercise, exposure of the cell to harmful materials (ethanol, arsenic, and trace metals, among many others), ultraviolet light, starvation, hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), nitrogen deficiency (in plants) or water deprivation. As a consequence, the heat shock proteins are also referred to as stress proteins and their upregulation is sometimes described more generally as part of the stress response.

The mechanism by which heat-shock (or other environmental stressors) activates the heat shock factor has been determined in bacteria. During heat stress, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) do not fold and cannot insert correctly into the outer membrane. They accumulate in the periplasmic space. These OMPs are detected by DegS, an inner membrane protease, that passes the signal through the membrane to the sigmaE transcription factor. However, some studies suggest that an increase in damaged or abnormal proteins brings HSPs into action.

Some bacterial heat shock proteins are upregulated via a mechanism involving RNA thermometers such as the FourU thermometer, ROSE element and the Hsp90 cis-regulatory element.

Petersen and Mitchell found that in &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; a mild heat shock pretreatment which induces heat shock gene expression (and greatly enhances survival after a subsequent higher temperature heat shock) primarily affects translation of messenger RNA rather than transcription of RNA. Heat shock proteins are also synthesized in &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; during recovery from prolonged exposure to cold in the absence of heat shock. A mild heat shock pretreatment of the same kind that protects against death from subsequent heat shock also prevents death from exposure to cold.

=== Role as chaperone ===
Several heat shock proteins function as intra-cellular chaperones for other proteins. They play an important role in protein–protein interactions such as folding and assisting in the establishment of proper protein conformation (shape) and prevention of unwanted protein aggregation. By helping to stabilize partially unfolded proteins, HSPs aid in transporting proteins across membranes within the cell.

Some members of the HSP family are expressed at low to moderate levels in &quot;all&quot; organisms because of their essential role in protein maintenance.

=== Management ===
Heat-shock proteins also occur under non-stressful conditions, simply &quot;monitoring&quot; the cell&#x27;s proteins. Some examples of their role as &quot;monitors&quot; are that they carry old proteins to the cell&#x27;s &quot;recycling bin&quot; (proteasome) and they help newly synthesised proteins fold properly.

These activities are part of a cell&#x27;s own repair system, called the &quot;cellular stress response&quot; or the &quot;heat-shock response&quot;.

Recently, there are several studies that suggest a correlation between HSPs and dual frequency ultrasound as demonstrated by the use of LDM-MED machine.

Heat shock proteins appear to be more susceptible to self-degradation than other proteins due to slow proteolytic action on themselves.

=== Cardiovascular ===
Heat shock proteins appear to serve a significant cardiovascular role. Hsp90, hsp84, hsp70, hsp27, hsp20, and alpha B crystallin all have been reported as having roles in the cardiovasculature.

Hsp90 binds both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase, which in turn are involved in vascular relaxation.

The subset of hsp70, extracellular hsp70 (ehsp70) and intracellular hsp70 (ihsp70), has been shown to have a pivotal role in managing oxidative stress and other physiological factors.

Krief et al. referred hspb7 (cvHSP - cardiovascular Heat shock protein) as cardiac heat shock protein. Gata4 is an essential gene responsible for cardiac morphogenesis. It also regulates the gene expression of hspb7 and hspb12. Gata4 depletion can result in reduced transcript levels of hspb7 and hspb12 and this could result in cardiac myopathies in zebrafish embryos as observed by Gabriel et al.

hspb7 also acts in the downregulation of Kupffer vesicles which is responsible for regulation of left-right asymmetry of heart in zebrafish. Along with hspb7, hspb12 is involved in cardiac laterality determination. A kinase of the nitric oxide cell signalling pathway, protein kinase G, phosphorylates a small heat shock protein, hsp20. Hsp20 phosphorylation correlates well with smooth muscle relaxation and is one significant phosphoprotein involved in the process. Hsp20 appears significant in development of the smooth muscle phenotype during development. Hsp20 also serves a significant role in preventing platelet aggregation, cardiac myocyte function and prevention of apoptosis after ischemic injury, and skeletal muscle function and muscle insulin response.

Hsp27 is a major phosphoprotein during women&#x27;s contractions. Hsp27 functions in small muscle migrations and appears to serve an integral role.

=== Immunity ===
Function of heat-shock proteins in immunity is based on their ability to bind not only whole proteins, but also peptides. The affinity and specificity of this interaction is typically low.

It was shown, that at least some of the HSPs possess this ability, mainly hsp70, hsp90, gp96 and calreticulin, and their peptide-binding sites were identified. In the case of gp96 it is not clear whether it can bind peptides &quot;in vivo&quot;, although its peptide-binding site has been found. But gp96 immune function could be peptide-independent, because it is involved in proper folding of many immune receptors, like TLR or integrins.

Apart from that, HSPs can stimulate immune receptors and are important in proper folding of proteins involved in pro-inflammatory signaling pathways.

==== Antigen presentation ====
HSPs are indispensable components of antigen presentation pathways - the classical ones and also cross-presentation and autophagy.

===== MHCI presentation =====
In the simplified view of this pathway HSPs are usually not mentioned: antigenic peptides are generated in proteasome, transported into ER through protein transporter TAP and loaded onto MHCI, which then goes through secretory pathway on plasma membrane.

But HSPs play an important part in transfer of unfolded proteins to proteasome and generated peptides to MHCI. Hsp90 can associate with proteasome and take over generated peptides. Afterwards, it can associate with hsp70, which can take the peptide further to the TAP. After passing through TAP, ER chaperons are getting important - calreticulin binds peptides and together with gp96 form peptide loading complex for MHCI.

This handing over with peptides is important, because HSPs can shield hydrophobic residues in peptides which would be otherwise problematic in aquatic cytosol. Also simple diffusion of peptides would be too ineffective.

===== MHCII presentation =====
In MHCII presentation, HSPs are involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Also when HSPs are extracellular, they can guide their associated peptides into MHCII pathway, although it is not known how they are distinguished from the cross-presented ones (see below).

===== Autophagy =====
HSPs are involved in classical macroautophagy, when protein aggregates are enclosed by double membrane and degraded afterwards. They are also involved in a special type of autophagy called chaperone-mediated autophagy, when they enable cytosolic proteins to get into lysosomes.

===== Cross-presentation =====
When HSPs are extracellular, they can bind to specific receptors on dendritic cells (DC) and promote cross-presentation of their carried peptides. The most important receptors in this case are scavenger receptors, mainly SRECI and LOX-1. CD91 scavenger receptor has been previously proposed as the common HSP receptor. But now its relevance is controversial because the majority of DC types does not express CD91 in relevant amounts and the binding capacity for many HSPs has not been proved. Stimulation of some scavenger receptors can even result in immunosuppression, this is the case for SRA.

LOX-1 and SRECI when stimulated guide HSPs with their associated peptides into cross-presentation. LOX-1 binds mainly hsp60 and hsp70. SRECI is now considered to by the common heat-shock protein receptor because it binds hsp60, hsp70, hsp90, hsp110, gp96 and GRP170.

The relevance for this type of cross-presentation is high especially in tumour-immunosurveillance. Thanks to the HSP, the bound peptide is protected against degradation in dendritic cell compartments and the efficiency of cross-presentation is higher. Also internalisation of HSP-peptide complex is more efficient than internalisation of soluble antigens. Tumor cells usually express only a few neo-antigens, which can be targeted by immune system and also not all tumor cells express them. Because of that the amount of tumor antigens is restricted and high efficiency of cross-presentation is necessary for mounting strong immune response.

Hsp70 and hsp90 are also involved intracellulary in cytosolic pathway of cross-presentation where they help antigens to get from endosome into the cytosol.

==== Damage-associated molecular patterns ====
Extracellular heat-shock proteins can be sensed by the immunity as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). They are able to interact with pattern recognition receptors like TLR2 or TLR4 and activate antigen presenting cells by upregulation of co-stimulation molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40), MHC molecules and pro-inflammatory and Th1 cytokines. HSP70 was shown to react to DAMP release, causing an influx of HSP70-positive T-EVs (tumor cells) that initiate anti-tumor immune signaling cascades.

Heat-shock proteins can signal also through scavenger receptors, which can either associate with TLRs, or activate pro-inflammatory intracellular pathways like MAPK or NF-kB. With the exception of SRA, which down-regulates immune response.

==== Transport into extracellular space ====
Heat-shock proteins can be secreted from immune cells or tumour cells by non-canonical secretion pathway, or leaderless pathway, because they do not have the leader peptide, which navigate proteins into endoplasmic reticulum. The non-canonical secretion can be similar to the one, which occurs for IL1b, and it is induced by stress conditions.

Another possibility is release of HSPs during cell necrosis, or secretion of HSPs in exosomes. During special types of apoptotic cell death (for example induced by some chemotherapeutics), HSPs can also appear on the extracellular side of plasma membrane.

There is a debate about how long can HSP keep its peptide in extracellular space, at least for hsp70 the complex with peptide is quite stable.

The role of extracellular HSPs can be miscellaneous. It depends a lot on context of tissue whether HSPs will stimulate the immune system or suppress immunity. They can promote Th17, Th1, Th2 or Treg responses depending on antigen-presenting cells.

As a result, the clinical use of heat-shock proteins is both in cancer treatment (boosting an immune response) and treatment of autoimmune diseases (suppress of immunity).

=== Lens ===
Alpha crystallin (α4- crystallin) or hspb4 is involved in the development of lens in Zebrafish as it is expressed in response to heat shock in the Zebrafish embryo in its developmental stages.

==Clinical significance==

=== HSF 1 ===
Heat shock factor 1 (HSF 1) is a transcription factor that is involved in the general maintenance and upregulation of Hsp70 protein expression. Recently it was discovered that HSF1 is a powerful multifaceted modifier of carcinogenesis. HSF1 knockout mice show significantly decreased incidence of skin tumor after topical application of DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene), a mutagen. Moreover, HSF1 inhibition by a potent RNA aptamer attenuates mitogenic (MAPK) signaling and induces cancer cell apoptosis.

=== Diabetes mellitus ===
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a immune-disease characterized by the presence of hyperglycemia. Typically these symptoms are brought about by insulin deficiency. However, there have been many recent articles alluding to a correlation between hsp70, in some cases hsp60, and DM. Another recent article discovered the ratio of ehsp70 and ihsp70 could have an effect on DM, leading to a sufficient biomarker. Serum levels of hsp70 have also been shown to increase over time in patients with diabetes.

=== Cancer ===
HSP expression plays a pivotal role in cancer identification. Recent discoveries have shown that high concentrations of eHSP can indicate the presence of contentious tumors. Additionally, HSPs have been shown to benefit oncologist in oral cancer diagnosis. Using techniques such as dot immunoassay and ELISA test researchers have been able to determine that HSP-specific phage antibodies could be beneficial &quot;in-vitro&quot; cancer diagnosis markers. HSPs have also been shown to interact with cancer adaptations such as drug resistance, tumor cell production and lifespan, and the up-regulation and down-regulation of oncomirs.

==Applications==

===Cancer vaccines===

Given their role in presentation, HSPs are useful as immunologic adjuvants (DAMPS) in boosting the response to a vaccine. Furthermore, some researchers speculate that HSPs may be involved in binding protein fragments from dead malignant cells and presenting them to the immune system. In a recent study published by Sedlacek et al., HSP was shown to effect different signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis responses such as STAT1 activation, gp96-activated macrophages, and activation of NK cells. Therefore, HSPs may be useful for increasing the effectiveness of cancer vaccines.

Also isolated HSPs from tumor cells are able to act as a specific anti-tumor vaccine by themselves. Tumour cells express a lot of HSPs because they need to chaperone mutated and over-expressed oncogenes, tumour cells are also in a permanent stress. When HSPs from a tumour are isolated, the peptide repertoire bound by HSPs is somewhat a fingerprint of these particular tumour cells. Application of such HSPs back into patient then stimulate immune system (promotes efficient antigen presentation and act as DAMP) specifically against the tumor and leads to tumor regression. This immunisation is not functional against a different tumour. It was used in autologous manner in clinical studies for gp96 and hsp70, but in vitro this works for all immune-relevant HSPs.

===Anticancer therapeutics===
Intracellular heat shock proteins are highly expressed in cancerous cells and are essential to the survival of these cell types due to presence of mutated and over-expressed oncogenes. Many HSPs can also promote invasiveness and metastasis formation in tumours, block apoptosis, or promote resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Hence small molecule inhibitors of HSPs, especially Hsp90 show promise as anticancer agents. The potent Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG was in clinical trials for the treatment of several types of cancer, but for various reasons unrelated to efficacy did not go on to Phase 3. HSPgp96 also shows promise as an anticancer treatment and is currently in clinical trials against non-small cell lung cancer.

=== Autoimmunity treatment ===
Acting as DAMPs, HSPs can extracellularly promote autoimmune reactions leading to diseases as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Nevertheless, it was found, that application of some HSPs into patients is able to induce immune tolerance and treat autoimmune diseases. The underlying mechanism is not known. HSPs (especially hsp60 and hsp70) are used in clinical studies to treat rheumatoid arthritis and type I. diabetes. Current therapeutic research areas in the treatment for DM include: long-term physical exercise, hot tub therapy (HTT), and alfalfa-derived HSP70 (aHSP70).

Hsp90 inhibitors are another possible treatment for autoimmunity, because hsp90 is necessary for proper folding of many pro-inflammatory proteins (components of PI3K, MAPK and NF-kB cascades).

===Agricultural===
Researchers are also investigating the role of HSPs in conferring stress tolerance to hybridized plants, hoping to address drought and poor soil conditions for farming.

==Classification==

The principal heat-shock proteins that have chaperone activity belong to five conserved classes: HSP33, HSP60, HSP70/HSP110, HSP90, HSP100, and the small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs). A standard nomenclature for human HSP genes is available.

Although the most important members of each family are tabulated here, some species may express additional chaperones, co-chaperones, and heat shock proteins not listed. In addition, many of these proteins may have multiple splice variants (Hsp90α and Hsp90β, for instance) or conflicts of nomenclature (Hsp72 is sometimes called Hsp70).

<text>The Supermarine Seafire is a naval version of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. It was analogous in concept to the Hawker Sea Hurricane, a navalised version of the Spitfire&#x27;s stablemate, the Hawker Hurricane. The name Seafire was derived from the contraction of the full name of Sea Spitfire.

A carrier-capable version of the Supermarine Spitfire had been proposed by the Admiralty in May 1938. Despite a pressing need to replace various obsolete types in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), some opposed the idea, including as Winston Churchill, although these disputes were often a result of the overriding priority for land-based Spitfires instead. During 1941 and early 1942, the Admiralty again requested naval Spitfires, resulting in an initial batch of Seafire Mk.Ib fighters in late 1941, which were mainly used to gain experience operating the type. There were concerns over weak undercarriages, which had not been strengthened to naval standards, but performance was acceptable.

From 1942 on, further Seafire models were ordered, including the first operationally-viable Seafire F Mk.III variant. This led to widespread use with the FAA. In November 1942, the first Seafire combat occurred during Operation Torch, the Allied landings in North Africa. In July 1943, the Seafire provided air cover for the Allied invasion of Sicily, and again in September 1943 during the Allied invasion of Italy. During 1944, large numbers provided air support to ground forces during the Normandy landings and Operation Dragoon in southern France. During the latter half of 1944, Seafire joined the British Pacific Fleet, where it intercepted &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks which had become common during the final years of the Pacific War.

The Seafire continued to be used after the end of the war, but the FAA withdraw all its Merlin-powered Seafires and replaced them with Griffon-powered counterparts. The type saw further combat use during the Korean War, in which FAA Seafires performed hundreds of missions in the ground attack and combat air patrol roles against North Korean forces in 1950. The Seafire was withdrawn from service during the 1950s. In FAA service, the type had been replaced by the Hawker Sea Fury, the last piston engine fighter to be used by the service, along with the first generation of jet-propelled naval fighters, such as the de Havilland Sea Vampire, Supermarine Attacker, and Hawker Sea Hawk.

==Development==
===Origins===
The Admiralty first showed an interest in the idea of a carrier-borne Spitfire in May 1938 when, during a meeting with Richard Fairey (of Fairey Aviation), Fairey proposed that his company could design and build such an aircraft. The idea met with a negative response and the matter was dropped. As a result, the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), at that point still part of the Royal Air Force, was forced into having to order Blackburn Rocs and Gloster Sea Gladiators, both of which proved to be woefully inadequate in the circumstances in which they were subsequently used. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, many of the aircraft operated by the FAA had been designed on the assumption that, Germany possessing no aircraft carriers, overall performance was to be of a secondary nature compared to the other duties required, such as observation and spotting, but, by 1941, these aircraft had become obsolete in comparison to the German and Italian land-based fighters they were occasionally required to operate against; thus, the need for more capable aircraft was readily apparent. As the Hawker Hurricane had quickly proven to be adaptable to carrier-based operations, there was considerable interest in navalising the Spitfire as well.

The matter of a seaborne Spitfire was raised again in November 1939 when the Air Ministry allowed a Commander Ermen to fly a Spitfire I. After his first flight in &quot;R6718&quot;, Ermen soon learned that Joseph Smith, Chief Designer at Supermarine, had been instructed to fit an &quot;A-frame&quot; arrestor hook on a Spitfire and that this had flown on 16 October; a drawing of this aircraft had been shown to the FAA on 27 October. After further discussions, Supermarine submitted a drawing of a Spitfire with folding wings and an arrestor hook. In this case, the wings had been designed with a fold just outboard of the undercarriage bays; as such, the outer wings would have swivelled and folded backwards to face parallel with the fuselage. On 29 February 1940, the Admiralty requested that the Air Ministry formally sanction the production of 50 folding-wing Spitfires, the first of which was to be delivered in July that year. For various reasons, Winston Churchill, who was First Lord of the Admiralty, cancelled the order, writing to Lord Beaverbrook: &quot;I regard it as of very great importance that the production of Fulmars should be kept going&quot;.

At a time of considerable demand for land-based Spitfires, due to the Fall of France and the subsequent Battle of Britain, the diversion of resources to facilitate the development and manufacture of a naval variant would have naturally reduced Spitfire production. To partially cover the gap until the Fulmar&#x27;s replacement (Specification N.5/40 – which would be the Fairey Firefly) was able to enter service, it was decided to instead order a number of Grumman Wildcats from America to equip the FAA. These aircraft would enter service towards the end of 1940 as the &quot;Martlet&quot;.
During late 1941 and early 1942, the Admiralty again assessed the Spitfire for possible conversion. In late 1941, a total of 48 Spitfire Mk.Vb were converted by Air Training Service Ltd. at Hamble to become &quot;hooked Spitfires&quot;. This was the Seafire Mk.Ib and would be the first of several Seafire variants to reach the Fleet Air Arm. This version of the Seafire was mainly used to allow the Royal Navy to gain experience in operating the Spitfire on aircraft carriers. The main structural change was made to the lower rear fuselage which incorporated an A-frame style arrestor hook and strengthened lower longerons. It was soon discovered that the fuselage, especially around hatches, was too weak for carrier operations. In an attempt to alleviate this condition, reinforcing strips were riveted around hatch openings and along the main fuselage longerons.

A further 118 Seafire Mk.Ibs incorporating the fuselage reinforcements were modified from Spitfire Vbs by Cunliffe-Owen at Eastleigh and Air Training Service. These aircraft were equipped with Naval HF radio equipment and IFF equipment as well as a Type 72 homing beacon. In these and all subsequent Seafires the instruments were re-calibrated to read kn and nmi rather than mph and mi. The fixed armament was the same as that of the Spitfire Vb; two Hispano Mk.II cannon with 60 rpg fed from a &quot;drum&quot; magazine and four  Browning machine guns with 350 rpg. Provision was also made to carry a &quot;slipper&quot; fuel tank under the fuselage. In June 1942, the first deliveries of the Seafire took place to 807 Squadron. Another front line unit, 801 Squadron operated this version on board from October 1942 through to September 1944.

===Further development===
The second semi-naval variant of the Seafire and the first to be built as such, was the Seafire F Mk.IIc which was based on the Spitfire Vc. The Vc had several refinements over the Spitfire Vb. Apart from the modifications included in the main batch of Seafire Ibs this version incorporated catapult spools, and a single slinging lug on either side of the fuselage, just behind the engine bulkhead. Three subtypes were produced, the F Mk.IIc and FR Mk.IIc (fighter reconnaissance), powered by a Merlin 46, and the L Mk.IIc powered by a low altitude Merlin 32 specifically manufactured for naval use. This version of the Merlin used a &quot;cropped&quot; supercharger impellor to provide greater power at low altitudes than the standard engines; delivering at . Both engines drove a four bladed diameter Rotol propeller. Because this version used the &quot;C&quot; wing the Hispano cannon were fed from a 120-round belt magazine, otherwise the armament was the same as that of the Ib; the FR also carried two F24 cameras. After trials of &quot;Rocket Assisted Take Off Gear&quot; (RATOG - small solid-fuel rocket motors which could be attached to the fuselage or wings of aircraft to help shorten the take-off run) in February 1943, this equipment became a standard fitting available for all Seafires. However, many FAA pilots rarely used RATOG, in part as there was little need for it, and due to the risks posed by asymmetric ignition.

The IIc model was the first of the Seafires to be deployed operationally in large numbers, Supermarine constructed 262 of this model and a further 110 being built by Westland, who also built 30 Seafire Mk.III (Hybrid) (Mk.IIIs without folding wings). Although developed for aircraft carrier use, this version still lacked the folding wings needed to allow them to be used on board some Royal Navy carriers, some of which had small aircraft elevators unable to accommodate the full wingspan of the Seafires.

The Seafire F Mk.III was the first true carrier adaptation of the Spitfire design. It was developed from the Seafire Mk.IIc, but incorporated manually folding wings allowing more of these aircraft to be spotted on deck or in the hangars below. Supermarine devised a system of two straight chordwise folds; a break was introduced immediately outboard of the wheel-wells from which the wing hinged upwards and slightly angled towards the fuselage. A second hinge at each wingtip join allowed the tips to fold down (when the wings were folded the wingtips were folded outwards). This version used the more powerful Merlin 55 (F Mk.III and FR Mk.III) or Merlin 55M (L Mk.III), driving the same four-bladed propeller unit used by the IIc series; the Merlin 55M was another version of the Merlin for maximum performance at low altitude. Other modifications that were made on the Spitfire made their way to the Seafire as well including a slim &quot;Aero-Vee&quot; air filter and six-stack &quot;ejector type&quot; exhausts. The shorter barrelled, lightweight Hispano Mk.V cannon were introduced during production as were overload fuel tank fittings in the wings This Mark was built in larger numbers than any other Seafire variant; of the 1,220 manufactured Westland built 870 and Cunliffe Owen 350. In 1947 12 Mk.IIIs were stripped of their naval equipment by Supermarine and delivered to the Irish Air Corps.

After the Mk.III series, the next Seafire variant to appear was the Seafire F Mk.XV, which was powered by a Griffon VI – single-stage supercharger, rated at at driving a Rotol propeller. Designed in response to Specification N.4/43 this appeared to be a naval Spitfire F Mk.XII; in reality the Mk.XV was an amalgamation of a strengthened Seafire III airframe and wings with the wing fuel tanks, retractable tailwheel, larger elevators and broad-chord &quot;pointed&quot; rudder of the Spitfire VIII. The engine cowling was different from that of the Spitfire XII series, being secured with a larger number of fasteners and lacking the acorn shaped blister behind the spinner. The final 30 Mk.XVs were built with the blown &quot;teardrop&quot; cockpit canopy and cut down rear fuselage introduced on the Spitfire Mk.XVI. On the first 50 aircraft manufactured by Cunliffe-Owen a heavier, strengthened A-frame arrestor hook was fitted to cope with the greater weight. On subsequent Mk.XVs a new form of &quot;sting&quot; type arrestor hook was used; this version was attached to the reinforced rudder post at the rear of the fuselage and was housed in a fairing below the base of the shortened rudder. A vee-shaped guard forward of the tailwheel prevented arrestor wires getting tangled up with the tailwheel. 390 Seafire XVs were built by Cunliffe-Owen and Westland from late 1944. Six prototypes had been built by Supermarine.

One problem which immediately surfaced was the poor deck behaviour of this mark, especially on take-off. At full power the slipstream of the propeller, which swung to the left (as opposed to the Merlin, which swung to the right), often forced the Seafire to swing to starboard, even with the rudder hard over on opposite lock. This sometimes led to a collision with the carrier&#x27;s island. The undercarriage oleo legs were still the same of those of the much lighter Merlin engined Spitfires, meaning that the swing was often accompanied by a series of hops. As an interim measure it was recommended that pilots avoid using full power on take-off (+ &quot;boost&quot; maximum was recommended). There were also problems involved with this swing being strongly accentuated in the event of an asymmetric firing of the RATOG equipment. In the event, none of the &quot;first generation&quot; Griffon-engine Seafires were to use RATOG at sea unless they were ranged forward of the first crash barrier on deck.

The Seafire F Mk.XVII was a modified Mk.XV; the most important change was the reinforced main undercarriage which used longer oleos and a lower rebound ratio. This went some way towards taming the deck behaviour of the Mk.XV, reduced the propensity of the propeller tips &quot;pecking&quot; the deck during an arrested landing and the softer oleos stopped the aircraft from occasionally bouncing over the arrestor wires and into the crash barrier. Most production XVIIs had the cut down rear fuselage and teardrop canopy (the windscreen was modified to a rounded section, with narrow quarter windows, rather than the flat windscreen used on Spitfires) and an extra 33 gallon fuel tank fitted in the rear fuselage. The wings were reinforced, with a stronger mainspar necessitated by the new undercarriage, and they were able to carry heavier underwing loads than previous Seafire variants. 232 of this variant were built by Westland (212) and Cunliffe-Owen(20).
The Seafire F Mk.45 and FR Mk.45 was the first to use a Griffon 60 series engine with a two-stage, two speed supercharger. The prototype &quot;TM379&quot; had been modified from a Spitfire F Mk.21 prototype by Cunliffe-Owen and featured a &quot;sting&quot; arrestor hook. Because this version was considered to be an &quot;interim&quot; type the wing, which was unchanged from that of the Spitfire Mk.21, was non-folding. The fuel capacity of this variant was in two main forward fuselage tanks: the lower tank carried while the upper tank carried , plus two fuel tanks built into the leading edges of the wings with capacities of respectively. The Seafire F Mk.45 entered service with 778 Squadron in November 1946 and a few were modified to FR Mk.45s in March 1947 by being fitted with two F24 cameras in the rear fuselage. Fifty F Mk.45s were built by the Castle Bromwich factory.

The Seafire F Mk.46 and FR Mk.46 was a Spitfire F Mk.22 modified to naval standard and featured the cut down rear fuselage and &quot;teardrop&quot; canopy. Again the wing had not been modified to fold. The electrical equipment was changed from a 12 volt system to 24 volts. The fuel system was modified over that of the Seafire 45 to incorporate an extra fuel tank in the rear fuselage, while the wings were plumbed to allow for a combat tank carried underneath each wing. In addition a drop tank could be carried under the fuselage. In April 1947, the Griffon 61s or 64s driving a five bladed Rotol propeller unit were replaced with Griffon 85s or 87s driving two three bladed Rotol contra-rotating propellers. All but the first few incorporated larger tail units from the Spiteful and Seafang. These two changes transformed the handling by eliminating the swing to starboard of previous Griffon engined variants. 200 of the Mk.46s were ordered but only 24 were built, all by Supermarine.

The final version of the Seafire was the Seafire F Mk.47 and FR Mk.47. There was no true prototype, instead the first production aircraft &quot;PS944&quot; and &quot;PS945&quot; served as trials aircraft. As the &quot;definitive&quot; carrier based Seafire, the Mk.47 incorporated several refinements over earlier variants. After the first four aircraft, with manually folded wings, the Mk.47 incorporated hydraulically powered wing folding, the outer wings folding upwards in one piece, without the folding wingtips of earlier marks. All Mk.47s adopted the Rotol contra-rotating propellers. The Mk.47 also featured a long supercharger air-duct, the intake of which started just behind the spinner and a modified curved windscreen, similar to that used on the Mk.XVII. Other features unique to the Mk.47s were spring-loaded elevator tabs, a large inertia weight in the elevator control system and beading on the trailing edges of the elevators. These changes improved longitudinal stability, especially when the aircraft was fully loaded. The modified windscreen proved to be unpopular with pilots because of continual problems with misting and the thicker, repositioned frames obstructed visibility during deck landings. In spite of recommendations to change the windscreen back to a standard Spitfire 24 unit, this was never done. Performance tests showed that the Mk.47 was slightly slower than the Mk.46 in maximum and climbing speeds, mainly due to the long supercharger air intake, which was less efficient than the shorter type fitted to earlier Seafires. The first fourteen aircraft were powered by the Griffon 87, but the rest of the 89 production aircraft (built by Supermarine at South Marston) were powered by the Griffon 88, which used a Rolls-Royce fuel-injection system instead of the carburettor used on earlier Spitfires and Seafires. The Seafire 47 saw action with 800 Squadron on board during the Malayan Emergency of 1949 and during the Korean War in 1950. However, in 1951 all Seafires were withdrawn from front-line service. In all 90 F Mk.47s and FR Mk.47s were built, all by Supermarine. &quot;VR971,&quot; the last of the 22,000 aircraft built under the Spitfire/Seafire program, left the production line at Supermarine on 28 January 1949. The maximum level speed for this mark was: 451mph at 20,000ft or 433mph at 24,000ft, ceiling: 43,100ft, range: 405 miles plus 15 minutes combat. 

=== Assessment ===
The Spitfire&#x27;s original role, in which it proved formidable, was that of short-range land-based interceptor. As a carrier based fighter, the design was a compromise and suffered many losses through structural damage that was inflicted by heavy landings on carrier decks: a problem that continued even with the strengthening introduced by the Mk.II. The Seafire had a narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not well suited to deck operations. The many modifications had shifted the centre-of-gravity aft, making low-speed control difficult and the aircraft&#x27;s stall characteristics meant that it was difficult to land accurately on the carrier, resulting in many accidents. Other problems included the Spitfire&#x27;s short range and endurance (acceptable for an interceptor but not for carrier operations), limited weapons load and that it was dangerous to ditching. The first Seafire variant to overcome many of these problems was the Mk.XVII with its new undercarriage design, reinforced structure and extra fuel tanks, although there were still some compromises and it entered service well after the war was over.

The low point of Seafire operations came during Operation Avalanche the invasion of Salerno in September 1943. Of the 106 Seafires available to the British escort carriers on 9 September only 39 were serviceable by the dawn of D-Day plus Two (11 September). Part of this was attributed to the flat, calm conditions present, which meant that there had not been enough headwind in order to adequately slow down the Seafires on landing. Many aircraft missed picking up the arrestor wires and flew into the crash barriers while others had their arrestor hooks pulled off the fuselage because they caught the wires at too high a speed. In spite of these problems, the Seafires (especially the L Mk.IIs and L Mk.IIIs, with their low altitude Merlin engines) patrolled over the carrier fleet as protection against low altitude attackers, while the longer range fighters, such as the Grumman F6F Hellcat, took on a similar role further out and at higher altitudes.

The Seafire II outperformed the A6M-5 Zero at low altitudes when the two types were tested against each other. Contemporary Allied aircraft which had been specifically designed for carrier use, such as the Grumman F6F Hellcat, were considerably larger and more robust. The more powerful Seafire III enjoyed better climb rates and acceleration than these other fighters. Late-war Seafire models equipped with Griffon engines enjoyed a considerable increase of performance compared to their Merlin-engined predecessors but had serious faults, mainly a result of the increased power of the new engine. The concomitant increase in torque meant the pilot had to continuously correct the flight of the aircraft to prevent the frame of the aircraft rotating in the other direction to that of the propeller. This was a considerable problem when attempting to take off and land from an aircraft carrier. The torque also affected the lift of the right wing (the Griffon engines rotated anti-clockwise) which would lose lift and even stall at moderate speeds. The increased weight of the engine meant that the take-off had to be longer, which proved very dangerous from most British carriers. The increased weight of the engine further affected the centre of gravity that Mitchell had concentrated on so carefully in the original Spitfire. As a result, the handling of the aircraft suffered. Eventually most of these problems were resolved in Seafire 47 when the six-bladed contra-rotating propeller was adopted.

==Operational history==
===Wartime service===

During 1942 and into 1943, FAA squadrons progressively converted to the Seafire, eventually replacing the Sea Hurricane in front-line service. In the Fleet Air Arm, Spitfires and Seafires were used by a number of squadrons, the Spitfires used by training and land based squadrons. Twelve 800 series squadrons used Spitfires and Seafires (Numbers 801 NAS, 802 NAS, 808 NAS, 809 NAS, 879 NAS, 880 NAS, 884 NAS, 885 NAS, 886 NAS, 887 NAS, 897 NAS and 899 NAS). Several units of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve also flew Seafires postwar, including 1831, 1832 and 1833 squadrons.

In November 1942, the first combat use of the Seafire occurred during Operation Torch, the Allied landings in North Africa, from the decks of several escort and fleet carriers; unusually, Seafires flew with American star markings during the operation, these were removed following their withdrawal from the theatre. In July 1943, the Seafire was used to provide air cover for the Allied invasion of Sicily; and reprised this role in September 1943 during the subsequent Allied invasion of Italy, being used to maintain continuous air cover of the beachheads, the type being almost entirely responsible for this task. During the latter operation, around half of the taskforce&#x27;s Seafires were inoperable within four days, primarily due to landing accidents.

During 1944, Seafires were used for air cover in support of several aerial bombing missions against the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. In June 1944, multiple Seafire squadrons were used during the Normandy landings for the purpose of locating in-land targets for naval gunnery batteries to attack; during this operation, these aircraft had been placed under RAF control and were operated from shore bases, these were returned to FAA control in July 1944. In August 1944, Seafires were used to support Allied ground forces during Operation Dragoon in Southern France.
During the latter half of the war, the Seafire saw increasing service as part of Britain&#x27;s contribution to the Far East Pacific campaigns, serving with No. 887 and 894 Squadrons, Fleet Air Arm, aboard and joining the British Pacific Fleet late in 1944. As range quickly became a detrimental factor in Pacific operations, Seafires in this theatre were often fitted with additional fuel tanks previously used by Curtiss P-40 Warhawks. Due to their good high altitude performance and lack of ordnance-carrying capabilities (compared to the Hellcats and Corsairs of the Fleet) the Seafires were allocated the vital defensive duties of Combat Air Patrol (CAP) over the fleet. During May 1945, Seafires were used to cover the Allied landings at Rangoon for Operation Crimson. Seafires were thus heavily involved in countering the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks during the Okinawa landings and beyond. The Seafire was operational in the Pacific Fleet right up to VJ Day, being used off the coast of Japan during the final months of the war.

The Seafires&#x27; best day was 15 August 1945, shooting down eight attacking aircraft for one loss. During the campaign 887 NAS claimed 12 kills and 894 NAS claimed 10 kills (with two more claims earlier in 1944 over Norway). The top scoring Seafire pilot of the war was Sub-Lieutenant R.H. Reynolds DSC of 894, who claimed 4.5 air victories in 1944–5.

===Post war service===
During the immediate post-war service, the Fleet Air Arm quickly replaced its Merlin-powered Seafires with Griffon-powered counterparts. Accordingly, the service initially adopted the Seafire Mk.XV and Mk.17; from 1948, the FAA began accepting the definitive model of the Seafire, the Mk.47.
In 1950, HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; started a tour of the Far East, embarking 800 Naval Air Squadron with Seafire 47s along with 827 Naval Air Squadron equipped with the Fairey Firefly following the outbreak of the Korean War, HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; was diverted to operations to try to stem the North Korean offensive, Seafires were engaged in performing ground attack and combat air patrols from July until September 1950, when HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; was replaced by , equipped with the newer Hawker Sea Furys. During operations off Korea, Seafires flew 360 operational sorties, losing one aircraft shot down by friendly fire from a Boeing B-29 Superfortress and a second aircraft lost when its arrestor hook failed to extend. The Seafire proved more vulnerable to the stresses of carrier operation with many aircraft suffering wrinkling of the rear fuselage brought about by heavy landings. Following the end of operations, when peacetime airworthiness rules were re-imposed, all but three of 800 Squadron&#x27;s Seafires were declared unserviciable owing to wrinkling.

The Royal Canadian Navy and French Aviation Navale obtained Seafires to operate from ex-Royal Navy aircraft carriers following the end of the Second World War. Canada&#x27;s Seafire Mk.XVs were flown from and then before being replaced by Sea Furies in 1948. France received 65 Seafire Mk.IIIs, 24 of these being deployed on the carrier in 1948 when it sailed for Vietnam to fight in the First Indochina War, the Seafires operating from land bases and from &quot;Arromanches&quot; on ground attack missions against the Viet Minh before being withdrawn from combat operations in January 1949. After returning to European waters, the Seafire units were re-equipped with Seafire XVs but these were quickly replaced by Grumman F6F Hellcats from 1950.

The Irish Air Corps operated Seafires for a time after the war, despite having no naval air service nor aircraft carriers. The aircraft were operated from Baldonnel (Casement Aerodrome) with most of their naval equipment removed, but retaining the folding wings. During the 1950s, an unsuccessful attempt to recycle the Merlin engines was made, by replacing the ailing Bedford engine in a Churchill tank with an engine from a scrapped Seafire. On 19 June 1954, the last Spitfire in Irish service was withdrawn.

<doc id="319280" wikidata="Q126772" url="?curid=319280" title="Rockaway Park Shuttle">
<text>The Rockaway Park Shuttle is a New York City Subway shuttle train that operates in Queens. It is the latest iteration of the Rockaway Shuttle services that have been running on the Rockaway peninsula since 1956. This shuttle train provides service to the central part of the peninsula, running between Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street to the west and . The fully above-ground route operates on trackage that was originally part of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Rockaway Beach Branch until the mid-1950s. During summer weekends, to eliminate an additional transfer and thus ease beach access, the Rockaway Park Shuttle is typically extended four stations north of Broad Channel to Rockaway Boulevard, the easternmost station shared by Rockaway-bound and Lefferts Boulevard-bound A trains.

Like the other two shuttles, 42nd Street in Manhattan and Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn, it is marked with the letter &quot;S&quot; and its route bullet is colored on route signs, station signs, rolling stock, and the official subway map. The internal designator for this service is H, though the MTA does not show this on any maps, train rollsigns, or schedules; the designation SR is also sometimes used on public documents.

Prior to 1993, the Rockaway Park Shuttle used multiple different designations, including the E, CC, and H, which had an emblem colored . The H formerly ran north to Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn via the IND Fulton Street Line, as well as to Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue to the east. In 2012–13, after Hurricane Sandy destroyed the IND Rockaway Line&#x27;s connection to the rest of the system, the H shuttle provided service from Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue to Beach 90th Street.

== Service history ==

=== 1950s to 1980s ===

The Rockaway Shuttle started operating on June 28, 1956. During its early years, it essentially provided non-rush hour and weekend service between Euclid Avenue and either Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue or Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street. At first, the route did not have an official assigned letter code on maps, although sometimes trains displayed either the or route on their rollsign boxes.

Beginning on February 1, 1962, the Rockaway Shuttle was officially lettered on maps and trains as HH (which had last been used for the Court Street Shuttle, discontinued 16 years earlier) to make it easier to distinguish E trains from shuttle trains. From November 26, 1967, to September 10, 1972, it was colored red, with daytime non-rush hour and weekend service usually available between Rockaway Park and Euclid Avenue or Broad Channel, plus some weekday mid-afternoon service provided between Far Rockaway and Euclid Avenue.

During the late night-early morning hours, service operating to and from Euclid Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line in Brooklyn was extended between roughly midnight and 6:00 a.m., which were the hours when the did not run to and from Far Rockaway. At those times, the HH would operate from Euclid Avenue to Rockaway Park, then to Far Rockaway via Hammels Wye, and finally back to Euclid Avenue, thus earning this &quot;night owl&quot; service the unofficial nickname of &quot;Rockaway Round-Robin&quot;.

Between September 11, 1972, and August 29, 1976, the shuttle&#x27;s identifier was known as the (colored aqua blue), although during rush hours this train was extended all the way to Jamaica–179th Street on the IND Queens Boulevard Line in Queens. Afterward, the designation (colored green) was used for the shuttle, running to Broad Channel, although during rush hours this train was extended all the way to Bedford Park Boulevard on the IND Concourse Line in the Bronx. In 1979, the MTA released a new coloring scheme for subway routes based on trunk line; CC service was assigned the color blue, because in Manhattan it used the IND Eighth Avenue Line.

On May 6, 1985, the shuttle&#x27;s identifier was changed to H (still colored blue) instead of reverting to HH, as the New York City Subway system had abolished two-letter designations by then.

=== 1990s changes ===

In January 1991, a reduction of service along the Central Park West corridor to remove excess capacity was proposed. As a result of the initial plan to make service local in Manhattan and Brooklyn (before it was amended to reroute the A via Sixth Avenue), H service would be expanded. This change was necessitated because all Central Park West express service would operate via Sixth Avenue, leaving no express service along Eighth Avenue south of 59th Street–Columbus Circle; daytime service would operate between 34th Street–Penn Station and either Ozone Park–Lefferts Boulevard or Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue in Queens, making express stops in Manhattan and Brooklyn and local stops in Queens. Additional rush hour trains to and from Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street would have provided limited service. Late night service would initially be replaced by A trains before the service plan was amended for late night service to be replaced by trains instead. This service change would have been implemented in October 1991, pending approval from the MTA board.

In 1991, at a series of meetings, the NYCTA presented proposed changes to A, C, and H service that would shorten the length of the C, simplify the service pattern during late nights to most efficiently serve the majority of riders, provide direct express service to Rockaway Park during rush hours in the peak direction, and provide shuttle connections during non-peak periods between Rockaway Park and through A train service. The service pattern devised was designed to improve operations by reducing route length and complexity, making service more attractive, simplifying confusing service patterns, and reducing transfers for passengers traveling during late nights. At the time, A service ran to Lefferts Boulevard and Far Rockaway during the day while the C ran to Rockaway Park during rush hours. During late nights, A service ran to Lefferts Boulevard, while service to both branches in the Rockaways was provided by the round-robin H shuttle service to Euclid Avenue.

As part of the changes proposed, round-robin shuttle service would be discontinued; late-night A service would operate from Manhattan to Far Rockaway; and service to Lefferts Boulevard and Rockaway Park would be provided by separate shuttle services with timed transfers to through A service. Rush hour local C service to Rockaway Park would be replaced by through A express service. In addition, H service to Rockaway Park would be replaced by the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which would run between Broad Channel and Rockaway Park, and C service would be truncated to Euclid Avenue. In April 1992, the MTA Board approved the proposed change to service in the Rockaways, which were expected to encourage ridership growth in the long term, and reduced NYCTA&#x27;s annual operating budget by $20,000. The changes took effect on October 23, 1992.

=== 2000s to present ===


Formerly, some maps and trains had shown the current S service in blue. Since May 2004, the official system map shows the Rockaway Park Shuttle as carrying a grey bullet. Recent prints, however, depicted the service itself in blue, but has been changed back to grey, as of January 2013. In order to distinguish it from the other shuttles, NYCT Rapid Transit operations still refers to it internally as the H.

 The Rockaway Park Shuttle was suspended following the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, due to track being washed out between Broad Channel and Howard Beach. On November 20, 2012, a free shuttle designated as H replaced the Rockaway portion of the A service between Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue and Beach 90th Street via the Hammels Wye. Additionally, the remainder of the Rockaway Line from Beach 90th Street to Rockaway Park was damaged and awaited repair. With the emergency implementation of this service, the H rollsign designation returned to public usage for the first time since 1993. Despite the service&#x27;s free status, few riders used the signed H service, partly due to the extremely low ridership at Rockaway stations to begin with; this ridership had been lowered further since Hurricane Sandy. In addition, the service did not run during late nights, and the service was only connected to the rest of the subway via a shuttle bus to Howard Beach. On May 30, 2013, full service to the Rockaways was restored, and the free H service was discontinued.

In late May 2016, the MTA announced that the Rockaway Park Shuttle would be extended from Broad Channel to Rockaway Boulevard on weekends from mid-June until Labor Day 2016. This allowed passengers on both Lefferts Boulevard and Far Rockaway-bound trains to transfer to the shuttle, and for shuttle passengers to transfer to more frequent A train service at Rockaway Boulevard. This summer weekend extension was implemented again starting in 2017 between Memorial and Labor Days. However, the extension for 2018 ended on July 1 and was replaced by rerouted A trains to Rockaway Park due to construction on Hammels Wye. In 2019, the summer extension was reinstated for the whole season, while in 2020, the summer extension was reinstated in July. Since then, the seasonal extension has occurred on an annual basis.

From April 9 to May 18, 2018, and again from July 2 to September 3, 2018, the shuttle ran between Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street and Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue due to a planned two-phase program of flood mitigation work along the Hammels Wye. To allow for repairs on the South Channel Bridge, from January 17, 2025 and lasting for 17 weeks, the Rockaway Park Shuttle fare free between Rockaway Park and Far Rockaway.

<text>A redowa () is a dance of Czech origin with turning, leaping waltz steps that was popular in European ballrooms.

==History==
The name comes from the Czech name rejdovák, derived from &quot;rej&quot; (&quot;whirl&quot;). Originally a folk dance, it first appeared into the salons in Prague in 1829 and fell out of fashion by 1840, though in the meantime it had spread beyond Bohemia.

Thomas Hillgrove states that the redowa was introduced to London ballrooms in 1846. Like other popular ballroom dances of the mid-nineteenth century, including the polka, it was danced in Paris prior to its appearance in London.

==Meter==
Like most dances currently described as waltzes, the redowa is danced in time, with the couple performing a full rotation every six beats.

==Description==
A basic redowa step contains one long reaching step and two small leap-steps. The long reaching step can be danced on either the 1 or the 2 of each bar of music, depending on what feels best with the tune that is playing.

Cellarius (1849) describes a three-part redowa consisting of a pursuit part (&quot;la poursuite&quot;), followed by the style of waltz commonly described as the redowa, and ending with a particular type of valse à deux temps. During the &quot;pursuit&quot; the partners hold each other hands facing each other and moving up and down at will and doing the &quot;balance&quot; forward and back, with lady following the cavalier.

===The lead===
Dancers generally start in closed (waltz) position with the outside hands pointing line of direction. (This description is for the case when the &quot;reach&quot; step is on count two.) To begin a redowa, the leader will take a small leap step (count 1) around in front of his/her partner with the left foot so that the leader is backing, then take a long scooping or gliding step (count 2) straight back with the right (pointing right toe, bending the knee of the left leg, keeping the torso upright), followed by another small leap step (count 3) with the left to complete a 180-degree turn clockwise. The second half of the six-count pattern begins with a small leaping step (count 4) along the line of dance, so the leader faces forward on the line of dance. The left leg now reaches straight forward (count 5; pointing left toe, bending right knee, etc.), directly under the partner&#x27;s right leg, which is extended back. A small leap (count 6) onto the right foot completes the pattern, completing the second half (180 degree) turn in preparation for the next six count pattern.

===The follow===
The follow is the opposite portion of the lead&#x27;s sequence. The follower&#x27;s movement on the first three beats are essentially the same movements the leader makes on the second set of three beats, and vice versa.

<doc id="319288" wikidata="Q720832" url="?curid=319288" title="Chris Burden">
<text>Christopher Lee Burden (April 11, 1946 – May 10, 2015) was an American artist working in performance art, sculpture, and installation art. Burden became known in the 1970s for his performance art works, including &quot;Shoot&quot; (1971), where he arranged for a friend to shoot him in the arm with a small-caliber rifle. A prolific artist, Burden created many well-known installations, public artworks, and sculptures before his death in 2015.

== Early life and career ==
Burden was born in Boston in 1946 to Robert Burden, an engineer, and Rhoda Burden, a biologist. He grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, France and Italy.

At the age of 12, Burden had emergency surgery, performed without anesthesia, on his left foot after he was severely injured in a motor-scooter crash on the island of Elba. During the long convalescence that followed, he became deeply interested in visual art, particularly photography.

He studied for his B.A. in visual arts, physics and architecture at Pomona College in 1965–1969 and received his MFA at the University of California, Irvine—where his teachers included Robert Irwin—from 1969 to 1971.

== Work ==

=== Early performance art ===
Burden began to work in performance art in the early 1970s. He made a series of controversial performances in which the idea of personal danger as artistic expression was central. His first significant performance work, &quot;Five Day Locker Piece&quot; (1971), was created for his master&#x27;s thesis at the University of California, Irvine, and involved his being locked in a locker for five days.

His 1973 work &quot;747&quot; involved the artist firing several pistol shots directly at a Boeing 747 passenger jet plane while it took off from Los Angeles International Airport. The piece had a single witness, photographer Terry McDonnell, who filmed the act.

His best-known work from that time is perhaps the 1971 performance piece &quot;Shoot&quot;, in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about with a .22 rifle.

Other performances from the 1970s included &quot;Deadman&quot; (1972), in which Burden lay on the ground covered with a canvas sheet and a set of road flares until bystanders assumed he was dead and called emergency services (leading to his arrest); &quot;Match Piece&quot; (1972) (also known as &quot;Match&quot;), in which Burden launched lit matches at a naked woman lying between him and a set of two televisions in a room covered with butcher paper (1972); &quot;B.C. Mexico&quot; (1973), in which he kayaked to a desolate beach in Baja Mexico where he lived for 11 days with no food and only water; &quot;Fire Roll&quot; (1973), in which he set a pair of pants on fire and then rolled on them to extinguish them; &quot;Prelude to 220, or 110&quot;, in which he had himself bolted to a concrete floor by copper bands, next to two buckets of water that also contained live 110-volt wires; &quot;Honest Labor&quot; (1979), in which he dug a large ditch; &quot;Velvet Water&quot; (1974), in which he spent five minutes attempting to breathe water as a live audience watched; &quot;Do You Believe in Television&quot; (1976), in which he sent an audience to the third floor of a building — where television monitors showed them the ground floor — and then lit a fire on the ground floor (sources differ as to whether the monitors showed the fire, forcing the audience to realize that the screens represented reality, or showed an intact ground floor, forcing them to realize that the screens &quot;did not&quot; represent reality); and &quot;TV Hijack&quot; (1972) wherein, during a live television interview to which he had brought his own camera crew, he held interviewer Phyllis Lutjeans at knifepoint and threatened to kill her if the station stopped live transmission (when asked about the incident in 2015, Lutjeans stated that Burden was a &#x27;gentle soul&#x27;, that she knew it was an art piece, and that the incident did not damage their pre-existing friendship); to conclude the piece, he demanded to be given the station&#x27;s recording of the incident, which he then destroyed.

One of Burden&#x27;s most reproduced and cited pieces, &quot;Trans-Fixed&quot; took place on April 23, 1974, at Speedway Avenue in Venice, California. For this performance, Burden lay face up on a Volkswagen Beetle and had nails hammered into both of his hands, as if he were being crucified on the car. The car was pushed out of the garage and the engine revved for two minutes before being pushed back into the garage.

Later that year, Burden performed his piece &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; at the Ronald Feldman Gallery in New York City. For this work of experiment performance and self-inflicting danger, Burden spent twenty-two days lying on a triangular platform in the corner of the gallery. He was out of sight from all viewers and he could not see them either. According to Burden, he did not eat, talk, or come down the entire time.

Several of Burden&#x27;s other performance pieces were considered controversial at the time: another &quot;danger piece&quot; was &quot;Doomed&quot; (1975), in which Burden lay motionless in a gallery at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago under a slanted sheet of glass near a running wall clock. Burden planned to remain in that position until a museum employee prioritized his well-being over the artistic integrity of the piece. After 40 hours, the museum staff consulted physicians. 5 hours and 10 minutes after that, museum employee Dennis O&#x27;Shea placed a pitcher of water within Burden&#x27;s reach, at which point Burden rose, smashed the glass, and took a hammer to the clock, thus ending the piece.

By the end of the 1970s, Burden turned instead to vast engineered sculptural installations. In 1975, he created the fully operational &quot;B-Car&quot;, a lightweight four-wheeled vehicle that he described as being &quot;able to travel 100 miles per hour and achieve 100 miles per gallon&quot; ( and ). Some of his other works from that period are &quot;DIECIMILA&quot; (1977), a facsimile of an Italian 10,000 Lira note, possibly the first fine art print that (like paper money) is printed on both sides of the paper; &quot;The Speed of Light Machine&quot; (1983), in which he reconstructed a scientific experiment with which to &quot;see&quot; the speed of light; and the installation &quot;C.B.T.V.&quot; (1977), a reconstruction of the first ever made Mechanical television. Burden was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts in 1978. 

In 1978, he became a professor at University of California, Los Angeles, a position from which he resigned in 2005 due to a controversy over the university&#x27;s alleged mishandling of a student&#x27;s classroom performance piece that echoed one of Burden&#x27;s own performance pieces. Burden cited the performance in his letter of resignation, saying that the student should have been suspended during the investigation into whether school safety rules had been violated. The performance allegedly involved a loaded gun, but authorities were unable to substantiate this.

In 1979, Burden first exhibited his notable &quot;Big Wheel&quot; exhibition at Rosamund Felsen Gallery. It was later exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

In 1980, he produced &quot;The Atomic Alphabet&quot; – a giant, poster-sized hand-colored lithograph – and performed the text dressed in leather and punctuating each letter with an angry stomp. Twenty editions of the work were produced and are largely in the possession of museums, including SFMOMA and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

1988&#x27;s &quot;Samson&quot; was a 100-ton hydraulic jack which was connected to a turnstile such that, with each guest who entered the Newport Harbor Art Museum, timbers were rammed into the museum&#x27;s supporting walls, meaning that &quot;if enough people entered the museum, it would collapse&quot;. The exhibit was forcibly disassembled by the local fire department after a complaint that it was blocking a fire exit. In 2008, Burden reported having subsequently sold &quot;Samson&quot; to &quot;a collector in Brazil&quot;.

=== Later work ===

Many of Chris Burden&#x27;s later sculptures are intricate installations and structures consisting of many small parts. &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1981) was inspired by the artist&#x27;s fascination with war toys, bullets, model buildings, antique soldiers, and a fantasy about the twenty-fifth century – a time when he imagines the world will have returned to a system of feudal states. The room-filling miniature reconstruction of two such city-states, poised for war, incorporates 5,000 war toys from the United States, Japan, and Europe – on a , sand base surrounded by a &quot;jungle&quot; made of houseplants. The gallery-sized installation &quot;All the Submarines of the United States of America&quot; (1987) consists of 625 identical, small, handmade, painted-cardboard models that represent the entire United States submarine fleet dating from the late 1890s, when submarines entered the navy&#x27;s arsenal, to the late 1980s. He suspended the cardboard models on monofilaments from the ceiling, placing them at various heights so that as a group they appear to be a school of fish swimming through the ocean of the gallery space. In 1992, he exhibited his &quot;Fist of Light&quot; during the Whitney Biennial exhibition in New York. It consisted of a sealed kitchen-sized metal box with hundreds of metal halide lamps burning inside. It required an industrial air conditioner to cool the room.

&quot;Hell Gate&quot; (1998), is a scale model, in Erector and Meccano pieces and wood, of the dramatic steel-and-concrete railroad bridge that crosses the Hell Gate segment of the East River, between Queens and Wards Island. In 1999, Burden&#x27;s sculpture &quot;When Robots Rule: The Two Minute Airplane Factory&quot; was shown at the Tate Gallery in London. It was a &quot;factory-like assembly line which manufactures rubber-band-powered model aeroplanes from tissue paper, plastic and balsa wood&quot;. Each plane had a propeller powered by a rubber band, and when each was completed, at a rate of one every 2 minutes, the machine launched it to fly up and circle around the gallery. Unfortunately, the machine was non-functional for at least two months of the installation, leading &quot;World Sculpture News&quot; to question the intent of the piece and remark that &quot;the work illustrated that robots, in fact, don&#x27;t rule everything, and for the time being, are still subjected to individual and groups shortcomings&quot;.

First presented at the Istanbul Biennial in 2001, &quot;Nomadic Folly&quot; (2001) consists of a large wooden deck made of Turkish cypress and four huge umbrellas. Visitors can relax and linger in this tent-like structure, replete with opulent handmade carpets, braided ropes, hanging glass and metal lamps, and wedding fabrics embroidered with sparkling threads and traditional patterns.

In 2005, Burden released &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;, his crewless, self-navigating yacht which docked at Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 28 July after a 5-day trip from Fair Isle, near Shetland. The project was commissioned by the company Locus+ at a cost of £150,000, and was funded with a significant grant from Arts Council England, being designed and constructed with the help of the Marine Engineering Department of the University of Southampton. It is said to be controlled via onboard computers and a GPS system; however, in case of emergency the ship is &#x27;shadowed&#x27; by an accompanying support boat.

In 2008, Burden created &quot;Urban Light&quot;, a sculptural work consisting of 202 found antique street lights that had once stood around Los Angeles. He bought the lights from the contractor who installed Urban Light, Anna Justice. The work is on view outside of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the solar-powered lights are illuminated at dusk.

In the summer of 2011, Burden finished his kinetic sculpture, &quot;Metropolis II&quot;, which took four years to build. It was installed at LACMA in Fall 2011. &quot;Chris Burden&#x27;s Metropolis II is an intense kinetic sculpture, modeled after a fast-paced, frenetic modern city.&quot;

Suspended from opposite ends of a telescoping balance beam of velvety rusted steel are a restored bright yellow 1974 Porsche sports car and a small meteorite. &quot;Porsche With Meteorite&quot; (2013) balances perfectly, with the heavier car much closer to the vertical support.

&quot;Light of Reason&quot; was commissioned by Brandeis University in 2014 and stands outside the Rose Art Museum on campus. The sculpture consists of three rows of 24 Victorian lamp posts which point away from the museum&#x27;s entrance. The sculpture serves as a gateway and outdoor event space, and has become a campus landmark.

Burden&#x27;s last completed project – a working dirigible that flies in perfect circles called &quot;Ode to Santos Dumont&quot; after the pioneering Brazilian aviator – was unveiled at a private Gagosian Gallery event outside of Los Angeles shortly before his death and later installed as a tribute at LACMA. Also, the New Museum decided to have &quot;Twin Quasi-Legal Skyscrapers&quot; (2013), two 36-foot-tall towers created for the museum&#x27;s retrospective on Burden, remain on the institution&#x27;s roof for several months in tribute. At the time of his death, Burden was also working on a watermill next to Frank Gehry&#x27;s not then yet completed aluminum tower at LUMA Arles, which was finished in 2021. Burden&#x27;s work remained unfinished at the time of his passing as well.

== Exhibitions ==
In 2013, the New Museum presented &quot;Chris Burden: Extreme Measures&quot;, an expansive presentation of Burden&#x27;s work that marked the first New York survey of the artist and his first major exhibition in the United States in over twenty-five years. Burden has also had major retrospectives at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, Newport Beach, California (1988), and the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna (1996). Other solo exhibitions include &quot;14 Magnolia Doubles&quot; at the South London Gallery, London (2006); &quot;Chris Burden&quot; at the Baltic Center of Contemporary Art, Gateshead (2002); and &quot;Tower of Power&quot; at the Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig, Vienna (2002). In 1999 Burden exhibited at the 48th Venice Biennale and the Tate Gallery in London. In the summer of 2008, Burden&#x27;s skyscraper made of one million erector set parts, titled &quot;What My Dad Gave Me&quot;, stood in front of Rockefeller Center, New York City.

== Collections ==
Burden&#x27;s work is featured in prominent museum collections such as the LACMA and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Tate Gallery, London; the Middelheimmuseum, Antwerp, Belgium; the Inhotim Centro de Arte Contemporanea, Brazil; the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, among others.

== Art market ==
Burden was represented by Gagosian Gallery from 1991 until his death. In 2009, a deal that Gagosian Gallery had struck to buy $3 million in gold bricks for Burden&#x27;s work &quot;One Ton, One Kilo&quot; was frozen when it turned out that the bricks had been acquired from a Houston-based company owned by financier Allen Stanford, who was later charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and sentenced to 110 years in prison for cheating investors out of more than $7 billion over 20 years in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history. As of 2013, the gallery&#x27;s gold has been frozen while the SEC investigates Stanford and &quot;One Ton One Kilo&quot; cannot be mounted until the gold bullion is released.

== In popular culture ==
David Bowie&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Joe the Lion&quot; was inspired by Burden&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Trans-Fixed&quot;, where Burden crucified himself on the roof of a Volkswagen Beetle. Laurie Anderson titled her 1977 song &quot;It&#x27;s Not the Bullet that Kills You – It&#x27;s the Hole (for Chris Burden)&quot;. Burden was also mentioned in the Jeff Lindsay book &quot;Dexter by Design&quot;, and in Norman Mailer&#x27;s book &quot;The Faith of Graffiti&quot;. The poem &quot;Doomed (1975)&quot; by David Hernandez in his 2011 collection &quot;Hoodwinked&quot; describes the Burden installation of the same name in Chicago. In poet Jason Schneiderman&#x27;s 2020 collection &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; there is a sequence about Burden.

== Personal life ==
Burden was married to multi-media artist Nancy Rubins. He lived and worked in Los Angeles, California. His studio was located in Topanga Canyon. From 1967 to 1976, Burden was married to Barbara Burden, who documented and participated in several of his early artworks.

Burden died on May 10, 2015, 18 months after having been diagnosed with melanoma. He was 69.

<doc id="319289" wikidata="Q28923017" url="?curid=319289" title="Strict programming language">
<text>A strict programming language is a programming language that only allows strict functions (functions whose parameters must be evaluated completely before they may be called) to be defined by the user. A non-strict programming language allows the user to define non-strict functions, and hence may allow lazy evaluation. In most non-strict languages, the non-strictness extends to data constructors. 

== Description ==
A strict programming language is a programming language which employs a strict programming paradigm, allowing only strict functions (functions whose parameters must be evaluated completely before they may be called) to be defined by the user. A non-strict programming language allows the user to define non-strict functions, and hence may allow lazy evaluation. 

Non-strictness has several disadvantages which have prevented widespread adoption:
* Because of the uncertainty regarding if and when expressions will be evaluated, non-strict languages generally must be purely functional to be useful.
* All hardware architectures in common use are optimized for strict languages, so the best compilers for non-strict languages produce slower code than the best compilers for strict languages.
* Space complexity of non-strict programs is difficult to understand and predict.
* In many strict languages, some advantages of non-strict functions can be obtained through the use of macros or thunks.
Strict programming languages are often associated with eager evaluation, and non-strict languages with lazy evaluation, but other evaluation strategies are possible in each case. The terms &quot;eager programming language&quot; and &quot;lazy programming language&quot; are often used as synonyms for &quot;strict programming language&quot; and &quot;non-strict programming language&quot; respectively.

==Examples==
Nearly all programming languages in common use today are strict. Examples include C#, Java, Perl (all versions, i.e. through version 5 and version 7), Python, Ruby, Common Lisp, and ML. Some strict programming languages include features that mimic laziness. Raku (formerly known as Perl 6) has lazy lists, Python has generator functions, and Julia provides a macro system to build non-strict functions, as does Scheme. 

Examples for non-strict languages are Haskell, R, Miranda, and Clean.

==Extension==

In most non-strict languages, the non-strictness extends to data constructors. This allows conceptually infinite data structures (such as the list of all prime numbers) to be manipulated in the same way as ordinary finite data structures. It also allows for the use of very large but finite data structures such as the complete game tree of chess.

<doc id="319290" wikidata="Q1637285" url="?curid=319290" title="Royal Naval Air Service">
<text>The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) was the air arm of the Royal Navy, under the direction of the Admiralty&#x27;s Air Department, and existed formally from 1 July 1914 to 1 April 1918, when it was merged with the British Army&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force (RAF), the world&#x27;s first independent air force.

It was replaced by the Fleet Air Arm, initially consisting of those RAF units that normally operated from ships, but emerging as a separate unit similar to the original RNAS by the time of the Second World War.

== History ==
=== Background ===
On 21 July 1908 Captain Reginald Bacon, who was a member of the Aerial Navigation Sub-Committee, submitted to the First Sea Lord Sir John Fisher that a rigid airship based on the German Zeppelin be designed and constructed by the firm of Vickers. After much discussion on the Committee of Imperial Defence the suggestion was approved on 7 May 1909. Though Bacon had been intended as the Superintendent of Construction, his departure from the Royal Navy in November 1909 saw the role fall to his protegee at the Naval Ordnance Department, Captain Murray Sueter. Consequently, Sueter was the first Royal Navy officer assigned to a naval air project.

On 21 June 1910, Lt. George Cyril Colmore became the first qualified pilot in the Royal Navy. After completing training, which Colmore paid for out of his own pocket, he was issued with Royal Aero Club Certificate Number 15.

In November 1910, the Royal Aero Club, thanks to one of its members, Francis McClean, offered the Royal Navy two aircraft with which to train its first pilots. The club also offered its members as instructors and the use of its airfield at Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey. The Admiralty accepted and on 6 December the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore promulgated the scheme to the officers under his jurisdiction and requested that applicants be unmarried and able to pay the membership fees of the Royal Aero Club. The airfield became the Naval Flying School, Eastchurch. Two hundred applications were received, and four were accepted: Lieutenant C. R. Samson, Lieutenant A. M. Longmore, Lieutenant R. Gregory and Lieutenant E. L. Gerrard, RMLI.

=== Formation ===
After prolonged discussion on the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Royal Flying Corps was constituted by Royal Warrant on 13 April 1912. It absorbed the nascent naval air detachment and also the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers. It consisted of two wings with the Military Wing making up the Army element and Naval Wing, under Commander C. R. Samson. A Central Flying School staffed by officers and men of both the navy and the army was created at Upavon for the pilot training of both wings, and opened on 19 June 1912 under the command of Captain Godfrey Paine, a naval officer. The Naval Wing, by the terms of its inception was permitted to carry out experimentation at its flying school at Eastchurch. The Royal Flying Corps, although formed of two separate branches, allowed for direct entry to either branch through a joint Special Reserve of Officers, although soon the Navy inducted new entries into the Royal Naval Reserve. In the summer of 1912, in recognition of the air branch&#x27;s expansion, Captain Murray Sueter was appointed Director of the newly formed Air Department at the Admiralty. Sueter&#x27;s remit as outlined in September 1912 stated that he was responsible to the Admiralty for &quot;all matters connected with the Naval Air Service.&quot;

In the same month as the Air Department was set up, four naval seaplanes participated in Army Manoeuvres. In 1913 a seaplane base on the Isle of Grain and an airship base at Kingsnorth were approved for construction. The same year provision was made in the naval estimates for eight airfields to be constructed, and for the first time aircraft participated in manoeuvres with the Royal Navy, using the converted cruiser as a seaplane carrier. On 16 April ten officers of the naval service graduated from the Central Flying School. As of 7 June 44 officers and 105 other ranks had been trained at the Central Flying School and at Eastchurch, and 35 officers and men had been trained in airship work. Three non-rigid airships built for the army, the &quot;Willows&quot;, &quot;Astra-Torres&quot; and the &quot;Parseval&quot; were taken over by the navy. On 1 July 1914, the Admiralty made the Royal Naval Air Service, forming the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps, part of the Military Branch of the Royal Navy. Promotions to the rank were first gazetted on 30 June 1914.

=== First World War ===

By the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the RNAS had 93 aircraft, six airships, two balloons and 727 personnel. The Navy maintained twelve airship stations around the coast of Britain from Longside, Aberdeenshire, in the northeast to Anglesey in the west. On 1 August 1915 the Royal Naval Air Service officially came under the control of the Royal Navy. In addition to seaplanes, carrier-borne aircraft, and other aircraft with a legitimate &quot;naval&quot; application the RNAS also maintained several crack fighter squadrons on the Western Front, as well as allocating scarce resources to an independent strategic bombing force at a time when such operations were highly speculative. Inter-service rivalry even affected aircraft procurement. Urgently required Sopwith 1½ Strutter two-seaters had to be transferred from the planned RNAS strategic bombing force to RFC squadrons on the Western Front because the Sopwith firm were contracted to supply the RNAS exclusively. This situation continued, although most of Sopwith&#x27;s post-1915 products were not designed specifically as naval aircraft. Thus RNAS fighter squadrons obtained Sopwith Pup fighters months before the RFC, and then replaced these first with Sopwith Triplanes and then Camels while the hard-pressed RFC squadrons soldiered on with their obsolescent Pups.
On 23 June 1917, after the Second Battle of Gaza, RNAS aircraft attacked Tulkarm in the Judean Hills.

On 1 April 1918, the RNAS was merged with the RFC to form the Royal Air Force.

At the time of the merger, the Navy&#x27;s air service had 55,066 officers and men, 2,949 aircraft, 103 airships and 126 coastal stations.

The RNAS squadrons were absorbed into the new structure, individual squadrons receiving new squadron numbers by effectively adding 200 to the number so No. 1 Squadron RNAS (a famous fighter squadron) became No. 201 Squadron RAF.

The Royal Navy regained its own air service in 1937, when the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force (covering carrier borne aircraft, but not the seaplanes and maritime reconnaissance aircraft of Coastal Command) was returned to Admiralty control and renamed the Naval Air Branch. In 1952, the service returned to its pre-1937 name of the Fleet Air Arm.

== Roles and missions ==

The main &quot;naval&quot; roles of the RNAS (ignoring for the minute the service&#x27;s direct field &quot;support&quot; of the RFC) were fleet reconnaissance, patrolling coasts for enemy ships and submarines, and attacking enemy coastal territory. The RNAS systematically searched of the Channel, the North Sea and the vicinity of the Strait of Gibraltar for U-boats. In 1917 alone, they sighted 175 U-boats and attacked 107. Because of the technology of the time the attacks were not very successful in terms of submarines sunk, but the sightings greatly assisted the Navy&#x27;s surface fleets in combatting the enemy submarines.

It was the RNAS which provided much of the mobile cover using armoured cars, during the withdrawal from Antwerp to the Yser, in 1914 (see RNAS Armoured Car Section below). Later in the war, squadrons of the RNAS were sent to France to directly support the RFC. The RNAS was also at one stage entrusted with the air defence of London. This led to its raids on airship stations in Germany, in places as far from the sea as the manufacturing site at Friedrichshafen.

Before techniques were developed for taking off and landing on ships, the RNAS had to use seaplanes in order to operate at sea. Beginning with experiments on the old cruiser , special seaplane tenders were developed to support these aircraft. It was from these ships that a raid on Zeppelin bases at Cuxhaven, Nordholz Airbase and Wilhelmshaven was launched on Christmas Day of 1914. This was the first attack by British ship-borne aircraft; the first ship-borne aircraft raid was launched by the Japanese seaplane carrier &quot;Wakamiya&quot; on 6 September. A chain of coastal air stations was also constructed. This was followed with the Tondern raid, again against Zeppelins, which was the first instance of carrier launched aircraft.

== Naval vessels ==

* , a light cruiser converted into a seaplane carrier. Sunk by German U-boat U-27 on 31 October 1914.
* , , , and , all converted Channel ferries. The first three ships each carrying three seaplanes were the &quot;striking force&quot; of the first naval air attack, the raid on Cuxhaven on 25 December 1914. HMS &quot;Vindex&quot; had a take-off ramp fitted and was the first operational ship to launch a wheeled aircraft.
* , a fast Isle of Man ferry converted to a seaplane carrier that served in the Gallipoli Campaign. &quot;Ben-My-Chree&quot; supplied the aircraft that made the first successful aerial torpedo attack against ships. A Short seaplane flown by Flt Cdr C. H. K. Edmonds carried a 14-inch torpedo between the floats which was dropped from a height of 15 feet, hitting and sinking a Turkish ship. &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; was sunk by Turkish artillery in 1917, but without loss of life.
* also served at Gallipoli, and continued service after 1918. She was renamed &quot;Pegasus&quot; in 1934, to release the name for the new modern aircraft carrier .
* was an ex-Cunard liner. Although she was much larger than those before her, the 120 foot take-off ramp was not sufficient for wheeled aircraft to take off. She sank in the Firth of Forth 5 November 1918, after a collision with .
* , a converted tramp steamer equipped with the Navy&#x27;s first kite balloon observation platform for gunnery spotting during the Dardanelles campaign.
* , a converted passenger ship with a take-off ramp. 
* , a converted battlecruiser, with an 18-inch gun aft and a flying-off deck forward. She was rebuilt as a through-deck carrier after 1918 and served in World War II.
* , laid down as the Italian liner &quot;Conte Rosso&quot; in 1914, was completed as a carrier with a full flight deck in September 1918.

==Armoured Car Division==

The first informal use of armoured cars by the RNAS was when Commander Charles Samson, on withdrawing The Eastchurch Squadron from Antwerp to Dunkirk, used the squadron&#x27;s unarmoured touring cars to provide line of communications security and to pick up aircrew who had been forced to land in hostile territory. Commander Samson&#x27;s younger brother Felix saw the possibilities when he armed one car with a Maxim gun and ambushed a German car near Cassel on 4 September 1914. Commander Samson then had a shipbuilder in Dunkirk, Forges et Chantiers de France, add boilerplate to his Rolls-Royce and Mercedes vehicles.

The Admiralty set up the UK&#x27;s first mechanised armoured land force, The Naval Airmans Armoured Car Force, to support the Marine Battalions fighting as infantry in France and Flanders. Established with 60 fighting vehicles in September 1914, 18 x Rolls Royce, 21 x Clement-Talbot and 21 Wolsey armoured cars supported by 40 non-fighting vehicles, 4 x Wolsey ambulances, 8 x cars to carry spare parts, 8 x general service cars and 20 lorries it had its headquarters in 48 Dover Street, London and Depot at Wormwood Scrubs.

By November 1914 the Force had become the Royal Naval Armoured Car Division (RNACD) with a planned expansion to 23 squadrons. In the end it mustered 20 active squadrons, 3 equipped with armoured cars , 7 with mixed armoured cars and lorries, 5 with motorcycle-combinations, 3 with armoured lorries, 1 experimental squadron (No.20) and an emergency squadron formed in Alexandria using armoured car sections from N.. 3 and 4 Squadrons not landed in the Dardanelles.

As trench warfare developed, the armoured cars could no longer operate on the Western Front and were redeployed to other theatres including the Middle East, Romania and Russia. In the summer of 1915 the 12 squadrons were disbanded and the army took over control of 4 squadrons of armoured cars, with the units coming under the command of the Motor Branch of the Machine Gun Corps.

On formation in December No. 1 Squadron was put on defence of the East Coast. No 2, commanded by Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, arrived in France in March 1915. The firepower of the Armoured Cars was reinforced by Seabrook lorries (three per squadron) armed with 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns.

No 3 and No. 4 Squadron, with Rolls Royce Armoured Cars were sent to Gallipoli but spent most of their time there protected in trenches until they were removed to Egypt - where the terrain was more favourable - to protect the canal and operate in the Western Desert.
Squadrons of the RNACD were used in German South West Africa (Rolls Royce Armoured Cars) and in British East Africa (Lanchester Armoured Cars with British Army Leyland lorries, later reinforced with a section of Rolls Royce from SW Africa).

In 1915, a RN armed steamer the SS &quot;Tara&quot; and SS &quot;Moorina&quot; had been sunk off the North African coast by the German submarine U-35, he survivors had ended up in Senousi hands and taken inland to Bir Hakiem. In 1916 the Duke of Westminister took a force of nine armoured cars, three Ford cars with Lewis gun armament, and 28 other cars and ambulances on an operation to recover them. After travelling 100 miles across the desert, the column reached the location where the Senousi gave up the captives without a fight.

The RNAS Armoured Car Expeditionary Force consisted of 3 squadrons formed from 15 and 17 Squadrons plus volunteers from disbanded units under Oliver Locker-Lampson, sent to Russia in 1915, the Caucasus in 1916 and Galicia in 1917. It was transferred to Royal marines&#x27; control in November 1917 before leaving Russia in early 1918.

However, RNAS experience of the Western Front would not be lost, No. 20 Squadron RNAS was retained under Naval control to further develop armoured vehicles for land battle, these personnel later becoming the nucleus of the team working under the Landship Committee that developed the first tanks.

The RAF later inherited some ex-RNAS armoured cars left in the Middle East, and during the Second World War, the Number 1 Armoured Car Company RAF played an important role in the defence of RAF Habbaniya when the base was attacked by Iraqi nationalists.

== Organisations ==
Before the poutbreak of War, the navy was charged with the home defence of Britain, which must inevitably mean the prevention of an invasion by sea or air, whilst the army was responsible for offensive action overseas.   As part of Britain&#x27;s defences, the role of the naval air operations was seen to be to prevent enemy invasion by air (specifically by Zeppelin airships), to locate enemy shipping that might pose a threat, and to develop bomber capabilities against enemy airship sheds or harbour installations.

Until June 1914 Naval air development had been managed from Eastchurch Naval Air Station, whilst operations were the responsibility of each Naval Port Officer in Charge.  The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) was formally created on 1 July 1914 with HQ at Eastchurch.  On 26 August 1914 a section of the RNAS, under Wing Commander Samson, was ordered to move to Ostend, Belgium, to support the Belgian Army in defending the Channel ports. A few days later a second section was sent to Dunkirk to support the French Army.  On 10 September 1914 the various sections of the RNAS were designated as Squadrons with a high degree of operational autonomy:

* No. 1 Squadron at Dunkirk supporting the French army;
* No. 2 Squadron at Eastchurch engaged in Home Defence and;
* No. 3 Squadron at Ostend supporting the Belgians.  

On 11 March 1915 No.3 Squadron was despatched to the Aegean to support the army in the Dardanelles Campaign.

The RNAS reorganised their operations on 21 June 1915 into Wings, each with a number of subsidiary Squadrons lettered as Squadrons a, b, c etc.

* No. 1 Wing (formerly No. 1 Squadron) was at St Pol near Dunkirk on reconnaissance and offensive operations over the Channel.
* No. 2 Wing (No. 2 Squadron) was now mainly carrying out defensive operations against Zeppelins from British aerodromes.
* No. 3 Wing (No. 3 Squadron) was in the Dardenalles providing naval support and
* No. 4 Wing based at Eastchurch was responsible for training and aircraft testing.

Each Wing included both land-based aircraft and seaplanes as required.

In August 1915 No.2 Wing was sent to the Aegean to reinforce No. 3 Wing, and No. 4 Wing took on the Home Defence duties.  In January 1916 No.3 Wing was withdrawn from the Middle East and disbanded, but it was reformed soon after as a specialist bomber force and sent to Belfort on the Western Front charged with disrupting German industrial production sites. Further Wings were created over the following months:

* Wings 4 and 5 were expanded from Wing 1 in France, the former being fighters and the latter having bombing duties.
* Wing 6 was formed for patrolling the Adriatic Sea, but was expanded to Malta by 1918.

The Wing denominations began to be dissolved in November 1916 when No.1 Wing was divided into three independent units designated as 1, 2 and 3 (Naval) Squadrons.  Nos. 4 and 5 Wings were similarly broken up into separate Squadrons on 31 December 1916 and by the end of March 1918, when the RNAS was absorbed into the newly formed RAF, only No.2 Wing in the Western Mediterranean was still in operation.  On the 1st April 1918 Squadrons of the RNAS took Squadron numbers in the RAF by adding ’200’ to their RNAS numbers.  It was not however until September 1918 that the Squadrons serving in the Eastern Mediterranean, still lettered A to D, and Z, formally adopted their RAF Squadron numbers they had been allotted.  Then Squadron A became Squadron 222; Squadron B became Squadron 223; Squadron C became Squadron 220; and Squadron D became Squadron 221 of the RAF. Squadron Z was transferred to the Royal Greek Navy.

==Ranks==
=== Officer ranks ===
In the RNAS both pilots and observers held appointments as well as their normal Royal Navy ranks, and wore insignia appropriate to the appointment instead of the rank. The insignia consisted of standard Royal Navy cuff stripes corresponding to their normal ranks, surmounted by an eagle (for pilots) or a winged letter &quot;O&quot; (for observers). In addition, Squadron Commanders and Squadron Observers with less than eight years&#x27; seniority had their insignia surmounted by two eight-pointed stars, one above the other, while Flight Commanders and Flight Observers had their insignia surmounted by one such star.

After the RNAS merged with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force in 1918, the RNAS pilot appointments became the basis of certain RAF officer ranks, most notably Wing Commander and Flight Lieutenant.

=== Other ranks ===

The following grades were introduced for other ranks in the RNAS and were announced in the London Gazette in 1914.

== History ==

The idea of an indoor shopping center with a hotel was envisioned in the 1940s by oilman Glenn H. McCarthy where a second phase was to include the Shamrock Hotel; this concept was scrapped right after the Hilton Hotel franchise took over the Shamrock in 1955. Glenn H. McCarthy&#x27;s abandoned concept would influence Gerald Hines in the late 1960s.

The Galleria was developed by Gerald D. Hines. The Neiman Marcus anchor store opened first, on January 28, 1969. The mall itself opened on November 16, 1970. The new shopping center was modeled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, borrowing, as its most distinctive architectural feature, a glazed barrel vault spanning the central axis of the mall. When it opened the mall had 600,000 ft² (56,000 m²) of retail space. The original skylights — which graced among other things a large, floor-level, ice rink, open year-round - had three hanging chandeliers. A connected 400-room hotel was opened in September 1971, the Houston Oaks Hotel (now The Westin Oaks Houston).

The first expansion, known as Galleria II, was begun in 1975 and opened on June 17, 1977. It added 360,000 ft² (33,000 m²) of retail space on two levels, Lord &amp; Taylor and Frost Bros. anchor stores, office space (known as the Galleria Financial Center since the early 1990s). A second hotel also opened as part of Galleria II on November 18, 1977, the 500-room Galleria Plaza Hotel (now The Westin Galleria Houston). Marshall Field&#x27;s joined the mall in 1979, in a store designed by noted architect Philip Johnson. In 1986, a second major expansion, Galleria III, opened with a new wing to the west of Marshall Field&#x27;s, anchored by Macy&#x27;s. Access to Galleria III from the main mall was through the Marshall Field&#x27;s store limiting the success of the new expansion. Subsequent solutions to solve the problem with signage and a bypass through the parking garage did not have much success in changing this issue. This brought the mall to almost 1.6 million ft².

In February 1989 the Galleria was 93% occupied, making it the mall with the fifth highest percentage of occupied space in the Houston area.

In 1996 Dayton-Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation), parent company of Marshall Field&#x27;s, exited the Texas market and sold its Marshall Field&#x27;s Texas stores. The San Antonio location was sold to Macy&#x27;s, and three Houston and Dallas stores to Saks Fifth Avenue. Saks Fifth Avenue would relocate its Post Oak Boulevard location into the Galleria as a flagship location after extensive renovations. The new Saks Fifth Avenue opened in 1997.

Hines Interests sold the mall in 1999 to a partnership of Urban Shopping Centers, Inc. and institutional funds advised by Walton Street Capital, LLC. The Walton Street affiliated funds separately purchased the office and hotel buildings at this time. Urban, in turn, was purchased by Netherlands-headquartered real estate investment group Rodamco North America, N.V. in 2000. Rodamco sold part of its stake in 2001 to the real estate investment arm of CalPERS as it tried to thwart a hostile takeover by a consortium including Westfield Group and Simon Property Group. Ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the buyout, Rodamco&#x27;s ownership interest and management operation of the mall was acquired by Simon Property Group in early 2002.

During these rapid ownership changes, development continued on a third expansion of the shopping center, known as Galleria IV. Completed in March 2003, it added to the south, anchored by Nordstrom and Foley&#x27;s, as well as an additional 70 stores. Upon completion of Galleria IV, the shopping mall totaled 2.4 million ft² (220,000 m²) of retail space.
an additional 100,000 ft² (9,300 m²) of retail space that opened in August 2006. This redevelopment included a Kona Grill, Oceanaire Seafood Room, Del Frisco&#x27;s Steakhouse, Gigi&#x27;s Asian Bistro, and nine other retail stores. During the reconstruction, some of the former Lord &amp; Taylor infrastructure was recycled, although a section of catwalks dating back to the Galleria II&#x27;s 1976 expansion was demolished; this trend was similar to the Galleria IV&#x27;s expansion in 2002.

In 2005, after the merger of the parent companies of Macy&#x27;s and Foley&#x27;s, it was announced that the Macy&#x27;s store at Sage would remain operational as a full line store and that the existing Foley&#x27;s would be renamed Macy&#x27;s in September 2006. The original Macy&#x27;s continued to operate until 2014 when it was razed to accommodate the relocation of Saks Fifth Avenue into a new state of the art flagship store on the Macy&#x27;s at Sage site. After the Saks relocation, the Marshall Field&#x27;s building was reconstructed into smaller shops. These provided direct access to Galleria III and the new Saks Fifth Avenue store.

In 2008, Forbes ranked the Galleria as one of the world&#x27;s best shopping malls.

Since the end of the government lockdown during the COVID-19_pandemic, the Galleria has announced several new additions, including Rag &amp; Bone, Bally, Savage X Fenty, Tous, Wilson, NBA Store, Moncler, Psycho Bunny, Blue Nile, Marc Jacobs, Offline by Aerie, and John Varvatos.

The Galleria includes a ice skating facility with x rink. The rink, known as &quot;Polar Ice&quot; and originally built in 1970, was the first ever built inside a mall. The rink is positioned below the mall&#x27;s central glass atrium which was originally added by Hines to increase the visibility of the stores in the lower level. There is a jogging track on the roof around the atrium with a view to this rink. About 50 restaurants and specialty food stores at all prices and service points are located throughout the Galleria complex. A Nobu was added to the property and opened in June 2018.

Two hotels are located directly in the Galleria complex. The 400-room Houston Oaks Hotel opened in September 1971, soon after the opening of the first wing of the Galleria. The 500-room Galleria Plaza Hotel opened on November 18, 1977, soon after the opening the second wing. Both were managed from their opening by Western International Hotels. That chain was renamed Westin Hotels in 1981, and the hotels were renamed The Westin Galleria and The Westin Oaks in 1984.

=== Offices ===
The Galleria has three office towers with Galleria Financial Center acting as the hub of the mall where the shops and offices share a common atrium with glass elevators and offices overlooking the mall below. The Galleria Financial Center is occupied by many financial institutions such as Merrill Lynch, UBS AG, Citigroup, law offices, financial services companies and energy trading companies. The other two office buildings are Post Oak Tower, and the Galleria Tower. Additionally, the Williams Tower is also connected to the mall.

<text>A market square (also known as a [[market place]]) is an urban square meant for trading, in which a market is held. It is an important feature of many towns and cities around the world. A market square is an open area where market stalls are traditionally set out for trading, commonly on one particular day of the week known as &quot;market day&quot;.

A typical English market square consists of a square or rectangular area, or sometimes just a widening of the main street. It is usually in the centre of the town, surrounded by major buildings such as the parish church, town hall, important shops and hotels, and the post office, together with smaller shops and business premises. There is sometimes a permanent covered market building or a cloth hall, and the entire area is a traditional meeting place for local people as well as a centre for trade.

<doc id="319295" wikidata="Q329385" url="?curid=319295" title="Schottische">
<text>The schottische is a partnered country dance that apparently originated in Bohemia. It was popular in Victorian era ballrooms as a part of the Bohemian folk-dance craze and left its traces in folk music of countries such as Argentina (Spanish Wikipedia and ), Finland (), France, Italy, Norway (&quot;), Portugal and Brazil (, &quot;), Spain (), Sweden, Denmark (), Mexico (), and the United States, among other nations. The schottische is considered by &quot;The Oxford Companion to Music&quot; to be a kind of slower polka, with continental-European origin.

The schottische basic step is made up of two sidesteps to the left and right, followed by a turn in four steps. In some countries, the sidesteps and turn are replaced by strathspey hopping steps.

Schottisches danced in Europe (in the context of balfolk), where they originated, are different from how they are danced in the United States. The European or Continental version (often pronounced &quot;skoteesh&quot;), is typically danced to faster music and is quite restrained in its movements. The American version (often pronounced &quot;shodish&quot;) is often large and open, with a slower tempo than the European schottische. The first part is often expressed equally as promenades, individual or led twirls or similar moves, and the second part is most often expressed as a close pivot.

==Contemporary==

===Argentina===
In Argentina, the schottische was introduced by Volga German immigrants (now usually called &quot;chotis&quot;) and also evolved and mixed into , an Argentine folk music genre.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, the xote has largely developed in the north-eastern area, especially the Sertão, where it has created variations such as and , which are usually grouped in the denomination. All of these rhythms are typically danced in pairs, being xote the slower and simpler style of dancing, in which the couple alternate left-left-hop-right-right-hop steps.

===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, the dance was also known as . It is danced in its more traditional folk variants as an exhibition dance, and also in the balfolk scene.

===Finland===
In Finland the dance is generally known as a . In general, it is faster in tempo than the Norwegian and Swedish .

===France===
The scottische was introduced in France in the 1850s. It rapidly disseminated from the salons to the countryside, becoming one of the most popular folk dances. It is one of the most common dance found in balfolk.

The or Spanish schottische, also known as the &quot;seven step&quot; gained popularity in France in the early 1900s.

===Germany===
Germans refer to the dance as a , which means Scottish. The Northern and Bavarian/Austrian Boarisch are closely related.

===Italy===
A dozen variations are known, for one or more couples, some free, some in fixed choreographies, and the original name became &quot;sciortis&quot; in Tuscany, &quot;sciotzè&quot; in southern Italy, &quot;sòtis&quot; in Romagna.

===Ireland===
In the folk music of Ireland, a schottische is closely related to the highland tune type, though possessing a higher proportions of quarter notes. The so-called &quot;German schottische&quot;, like the highland, was chiefly popular in Donegal and in Irish exile communities, notably Philadelphia, where Donegal emigrants settled. Also known as a &quot;barn dance&quot;, the &quot;German&quot; is a two-hand dance played to tunes that end each eight-bar phrase with three lightly-accented quarter notes.

===Mexico===
Known as , it was introduced in México in 1850. In the beginning it was just a high-class ballroom dance. It became popular after a while and then a more &quot;rustic&quot; style was created for public parties and dance halls. It is popular in the northern states of Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, Durango and Zacatecas.

===Norway===
In Norway, the dance is called a . The name may suggest an origin in the area of the Rhine – meaning that it could be from Germany or Bohemia. The name was known as &quot;&quot; in Bavaria.

===Poland===
In Poland, the dance was also known as &quot;polka tremblante&quot; or just .

===Portugal===
In Portugal, a form of schottische called or has become heavily standardized for folklore displays. The pairs in groups of four, six or eight, form a circle and dance embraced all together. The circle starts to rotate until a moment when the pairs pass; that is, the pairs that are opposite each other switch places crossing each other in the center of the circle. They continue to pass successively two by two, all the pairs. After everybody made their pass, they continue to dance by rotating in circle. Further along in the dance, all the pairs will join in the center of the circle to beat the center of the circle with their feet, and continue to dance rotating the circle in the initial position, always for the right side. Bear in mind that all the moves are made always by the pair and never by one of its elements separately, because in the schottische you can never switch pair.

===Scotland===
The Highland schottische is a combination of the common schottische and the old reel.

It has two main forms in beat, one being more popular than the other. Both versions are similar in starting line-up to the Gay Gordons and has a polka feel to it. Typical tunes for a Highland schottische are &quot;Brochan Lom&quot; and &quot;Laddie With the Plaidie&quot;.

In the more popular ceilidh version, the man stands on the left, the woman on the right. They join with left hands joined low in front and with the man&#x27;s right arm over the woman&#x27;s right shoulder and hands joined above it. The man points his left foot forward, toe to the floor and slightly to the left, whilst the woman does the same with her right foot. On the first two main beats, each partner raises onto their toes and performs a Highland step, bringing back the heel of extended foot against the calf of the other (inside) leg, whilst hopping on the other foot. They then trot forward 4 steps to the beat, pivot quickly so that the man is on the right and woman on the left, both facing the opposite direction of travel. Their right hands are now joined low forward and left hands above the woman&#x27;s left shoulder. They perform the same Highland steps as before but now on the opposite foot, before trotting forward 4 steps again. They then face each other with the man on the inside of the circle of travel, the man&#x27;s hands on the woman&#x27;s waist and woman&#x27;s hands on the man&#x27;s shoulders (alternatively, the partners adopt the waltz position for their arms and hands). They now trot sideways 3 steps to the left (man left/right/left; woman right/left/right), then hop on the same foot as the third step, then trot sideways right (man right/left/right; woman left/right/left) and hop. For the last four bars, the pair spin round as they progress, hopping twice on each foot and finally once on the last bar (man left/left, right/right, left/left, right). They then re-form with hands joined front and back, man on left as before. The dance, when performed at ceilidhs, usually has a jolly, light-footed, spirited feel and is often accompanied by vocal yelps, woos and hooches from the male partners. The hopping spin toward the end of the routine is often done with great gusto. It often causes the pleated backs of the men&#x27;s kilts to fly up and outward, sometimes with humorous results.

A variation popular in Argyll in the 1920s and &#x27;30s focused on showing the man&#x27;s dancing abilities and as such became known as a form of &quot;peacock dance&quot; (not to be confused with the Asian dances known by that term and featuring performers costumed as peacocks). For the period of the Gay Gordons stance, the partners do not move forward at all, then pivot and move back. Instead, the woman stays in one position, performing the Highland toe-steps with the right foot for four bars, while hopping. The man meanwhile performs two Highland toe-steps with the left foot while hopping. He then moves across behind the woman on his toes for four steps, so that he is now on her right. He then performs two Highland toe-steps with the right foot then moves back behind the woman to her left side again, whilst she performs her toe steps with the left foot while remaining on the same spot. Back on the left, he then faces the woman and they perform the second (polka) half of the routine as per the popular version described above.

A simplified ceilidh variation of the popular version does not required the Gay Gordons method of holding hands in the first half of the routine. Instead, the man holds the woman with his right arm across the small of the woman&#x27;s back and she does the same to the man with her left arm. The toe-steps are performed as usual and they pivot and turn, whereupon the man puts his left arm across the small of the woman&#x27;s back and she uses her right arm. The rest of the routine is as per the popular version.

===Spain===
In Madrid, the , or is considered the most typical dance of the city since the 19th century and it is danced in all the traditional festivals. Some of the tunes, as &quot;Madrid, Madrid, Madrid&quot; by the Mexican composer Agustín Lara, became very well known in all Spain. The authors of the zarzuelas created a host of new chotis and strengthened their popularity.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the dance is known as a . The name may suggest an origin in the area of Scotland. This is interesting because the Norwegian word used for the same dance is &quot;reinlender&quot;, suggesting an origin from the Rhine region.

===United States===
The schottische arrived in the United States from Europe and there are countless variations of the dance. After 1848, a number of old ballroom variants of schottische were danced in California. The &quot;Five-Step Schottische&quot; and a Highland schottische with modifications were included on lists of ballroom dances of the period. In Texas there have been schottische-like dances with names such as Drunk, Blue Bonnett, McGinty, and Douglas. Schottische variations include a straight leg kick, a kick-hop and a standing hop. Both include the traditional hop that is part of the schottische.

In the southern United States at the start of the 20th century the schottische was combined with ragtime; the most popular &quot;ragtime schottische&quot; of the era was &quot;Any Rags&quot; by Thomas S. Allen in 1902. In New Orleans, Buddy Bolden&#x27;s band and other proto-jazz groups were known for playing hot schottisches. It is also danced as a Western promenade dance in country–western dance venues, often after the Cotton-Eyed Joe.

==Australia==
Australian composers of schottische music include Christian Helleman and Henry Marsh.

<doc id="319296" wikidata="Q126725" url="?curid=319296" title="Franklin Avenue Shuttle">
<text>The Franklin Avenue Shuttle is a New York City Subway shuttle service operating in Brooklyn. The shuttle service uses the BMT Franklin Avenue Line exclusively and operates 24 hours a day. The north terminus is Franklin Avenue, with a transfer available to the IND Fulton Street Line. The south terminus is Prospect Park, with a transfer available to the BMT Brighton Line. NYCT Rapid Transit Operations staff refer to it internally as the S or FS. Like the other two shuttles, the 42nd Street Shuttle in Manhattan and the Rockaway Park Shuttle in Queens, its route bullet is colored on route signs, station signs, rolling stock, and the official subway map.

The S started running along its current route in 1963, and it has had four stations since 1995. Consumers Park was closed in 1928 and replaced by the current Botanic Garden station five blocks to the north. There is a visible clearing at the former station location. Dean Street was closed in 1995 due to low paid fare entrance and fare beating.

The shuttle runs two 2-car train sets of R68 cars under One Person Train Operation with the motorman also being the conductor. The motorman will go to the opposite end to make another run at each terminal. The northbound and southbound trains usually pass each other at Botanic Garden, the only station on the line to use both tracks. This effectively leaves a passing loop for the northbound train to leave Botanic Garden when the southbound train arrives.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The current service is co-extensive with the BMT Franklin Avenue Line. It parallels Franklin Avenue, hence the shuttle&#x27;s name (and the name of the line). It was originally a part of the mainline of what is now the BMT Brighton Line and opened as part of that steam railroad line in 1878.

The Franklin Avenue Line was established as a discrete route on August 1, 1920, when the Brighton Beach mainline was shifted to the new tunnel connecting Prospect Park station with the Fourth Avenue Subway at DeKalb Avenue station. Subway trains from the BRT Broadway Line in Manhattan and elevated trains from Franklin Avenue began sharing operations to Coney Island. The subway operations became the full-time service, and the Franklin Avenue trains provided a variety of scheduled services, based on day of the week, time of day, and even seasonal variations, reverting to shuttle service at other times.

After the city gained ownership of the line in 1940, Brighton–Franklin (labelled 7 by the BMT) services gradually declined. A major blow to through service viability occurred in 1954 when the train of the IND Division was extended to Coney Island via the Culver Line, depriving the Franklin of a major source of transfer traffic, consisting of passengers from Harlem and the Bronx, who now had a more direct route to Coney Island.

=== Truncation ===
Brighton–Franklin Sunday express service ended after the 1956 summer season, though it continued for several years as a summer-only local. The last through service, on Saturdays, ran on February 16, 1963 in advance of new BMT schedules in effect the next day, resulting in the 7 Franklin Avenue Line becoming a full-time shuttle. On November 1, 1965, when R27s started going into service, this service was named SS, and in 1985, when the practice of using double letters was eliminated, this service became the S. However, some trains from the 1960s to 1980s continued to use the BMT 7 signage.

On December 1, 1974, a southbound shuttle train of R32s was approaching the tunnel portal en route from Franklin Avenue when it derailed on the crossover at Empire Boulevard and smashed into the same place where BRT car 100 had hit in the Malbone Street Wreck. This derailment resulted in some injuries, with R32 car 3668 damaged beyond repair, but there were no fatalities, because time signals limit the speed of trains coming down the hill from Crown Heights.

=== Deterioration and renovation ===

In 1981, the MTA proposed abandoning the service under the failed Program for Action. At the time, only 10,000 passengers used the shuttle per day, and in addition, the Franklin Avenue Line was severely deteriorated. It was proposed that additional B48 bus service along nearby Franklin Avenue could substitute for the line. During the winter, the line would often be closed because there was fear that trains would derail. Stations were in horrible condition; portions of the wooden platforms were sealed off because they had burned or collapsed. In January 1982, the line needed to close for emergency repair work because a retaining wall along the line was in danger of collapse.

In the 1990s, the term &quot;Ghost Train&quot; was coined for the shuttle due to its increasing deterioration. It was shrunk in size to only two cars, and the Dean Street station, which only had 50 paying riders per day, was closed in 1995 due to extensive fare evasion. The entire line was under consideration for abandonment, but community leaders were opposed to the move. They showed up to town hall meetings, news conferences and they sat down with transit officials. They also formed the Committee to Save the Franklin Avenue Shuttle. The coalition included the Straphangers Campaign, a local church, local community boards and the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance. They argued that subway station repair work occurred elsewhere, while no attention was paid to the Franklin Avenue Shuttle.

In the end they convinced the New York State Assembly to force the MTA to rebuild rather than abandon the line, and as a result most of the supporting infrastructure and stations were completely rehabilitated for 18 months, between July 1998 and October 1999 at a cost of $74 million. While the closure of the line started in July 1998, work began in September 1997. During the renovation, a temporary shuttle bus and the B48 bus replaced train service. The line reopened on October 18, 1999, three months ahead of schedule.

, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle is the most punctual train in the New York City Subway system with a 99.7 percent on-time average. The shuttle averages 20,000 riders per day.

On June 7, 2024, the MTA announced that the Saint Marks Avenue bridge will be replaced during summer 2024, with no shuttle service on weekends between June 14 and July 8 and between August 9 to September 3. Between July 8 and August 9, northbound trains ended at Park Place, and free shuttle buses replaced service between Park Place and Franklin Avenue-Fulton Street. Full service resumed on August 10, 2024.

Effective December 15, 2024, service on the shuttle was increased, with weekend service beginning to run on an identical schedule with weekday service. Sunday service would run every ten minutes between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. and every twelve minutes from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., instead of every fifteen minutes between 7 a.m. and about 9 a.m., every twelve minutes between about 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., and every fifteen minutes between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.. Saturday headways were decreased from fifteen to twelve minutes during the 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. hour and from twelve to ten minutes between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.. In addition, weekday service began running every ten minutes instead of every twelve minutes during the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. hour.

<doc id="319298" wikidata="Q2309028" url="?curid=319298" title="Toque">
<text>A toque ( or ) is a type of hat with a narrow brim or no brim at all.

Toques were popular from the 13th to the 16th century in Europe, especially France. They were revived in the 1930s; nowadays, they are primarily known as the traditional headgear for professional cooks, except in Canada, where the term &quot;toque&quot; is used interchangeably with the French Canadian spelling of &quot;tuque&quot; to refer to knit caps.

== Name ==

The word &quot;toque&quot; has been known in English since around 1500. It is a loan word from the French (15th century), presumably by the way of the Spanish &#x27;woman&#x27;s headdress&#x27;, from Arabic طاقة, itself from Old Persian &#x27;veil, shawl&#x27;.

The word in Breton means &#x27;hat&#x27;. The spelling with ⟨que⟩ is Middle Breton, and the Modern Breton spelling is . Old Breton spells the word . 

==History and uses==
A tall, black toque made of silk or velvet, often ornamented with an aigrette, was fashionable among the Spanish nobility during the 1500s. This style is seen in a 1584 portrait of Isabella Clara Eugenia as well as Sofonisba Anguissola&#x27;s 1573 portrait of Philip II of Spain, both in the Museo del Prado. The style spread across Europe, being adopted in France, England, Germany, and Italy. The toque diminished in popularity in the 1600s as wide-brimmed and cocked hats became fashionable, but reappeared as a predominantly young women&#x27;s fashion in the 1800s, accompanying long dresses and chignon hairstyles.

===Culinary===
A (French for &#x27;white hat&#x27;), often shortened to toque, is a tall, round, pleated, starched white hat worn by chefs.

The toque most likely originated as the result of the gradual evolution of head coverings worn by cooks throughout the centuries. Their roots are sometimes traced to the (stocking cap) worn by 18th-century French chefs. The colour of the denoted the rank of the wearer. Boucher, the personal chef of the French statesman Talleyrand, was the first to insist on white toques for sanitary reasons.

The modern toque is popularly believed to have originated with the French chef Marie-Antoine Carême (1784–1833), who stiffened the with cardboard.

===Judicial===
* A toque, or sometimes touge, was the traditional headgear of various French magistrates.
* A low type in black velvet, called &quot;mortier&quot; (also rendered in English as mortarboard), was used by the &quot;président à mortier&quot;, president of a &quot;parlement&quot; (the royal highest court in a French province), and of the members of two of the highest central courts, &quot;cour de cassation&quot; and &quot;cour des comptes&quot;.
* A red toque is sometimes worn by German judges, primarily by justices on the Federal Constitutional Court.

===Academic===
The pleated, low, round hat worn in French universities the equivalent of the mortarboard or tam at British and American universities is also called a toque.

===Heraldic===
In the Napoleonic era, the French first empire replaced the coronets of traditional (&quot;royal&quot;) heraldry with a rigorously standardized system (as other respects of &quot;Napoleonic&quot; coats of arms) of toques, reflecting the rank of the bearer. Thus a Napoleonic duke used a toque with seven ostrich feathers and three lambrequins, a count a toque with five feathers and two lambrequins, a baron three feathers and one lambrequin, a knight only one ostrich feather (see Nobility of the First French Empire).

===Athletic===
Toque is also used for a hard-type hat or helmet, worn for riding, especially in equestrian sports, often black and covered with black velvet.

==Knit cap==
In Canada, &quot;toque&quot; or &quot;tuque&quot; is the common name for a knitted winter cap. While the spelling &quot;toque&quot; has become the most formally accepted in Canada, as recognized by the &quot;Canadian Oxford Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles&quot;, the alternate spelling of &quot;tuque&quot; is most commonly used in French Canada and often occurs in Canadian media. The spelling &quot;touque&quot;, although not recognized by the &quot;Canadian Oxford Dictionary&quot;, is also sometimes seen in written English.

In 2013, CBC Edmonton launched a poll to ask viewers how they spelled the word. The options given were &quot;toque&quot;, &quot;tuque&quot; or &quot;touque&quot;. Nearly 6,500 people voted, with Edmontonians remaining divided on the issue. Though &quot;touque&quot; was voted most popular in that instance, there is almost no formal usage to support its popularity.

The Canadian English term was borrowed from Canadian French word &quot;&quot;, and first documented in Canadian English in that form in 1865; by 1880 the spelling &quot;toque&quot; is documented. The fashion is said to have originated with the , French and Métis fur traders, who kept their woollen nightcaps on for warmth during cold winter days. This spelling is attributed to a number of different sources, one being the Breton &quot;toc&quot; or &quot;tok&quot;, &quot;meaning simply &#x27;hat&#x27;&quot;; another suggesting that it is a Francization of the Spanish &quot;tocar,&quot; to touch, as the long &quot;end of the sock cap&quot; of the Voyageurs hung down and touched their shoulders; and another source adamant that the word is borrowed from &quot;the old Languedoc dialect word &quot;tuc&quot;&quot; meaning &quot;summit&quot; or &quot;the head of a mountain&quot;.

The spelling of &quot;toque&quot;, on the other hand, is borrowed from the original usage as described elsewhere in this article. &quot;Toque&quot; also appears in the 1941 &quot;Dictionary of Mississippi Valley French&quot; as a &quot;style of hair-dressing among the Indians&quot; which was a tall, conical fashion not unlike the shape of the Voyageur-style cap described above.

Dictionaries are divided on the matter of spelling, with the &quot;Gage Canadian&quot; preferring &quot;toque&quot; and the &quot;Nelson Canadian&quot; listing &quot;tuque&quot; (the &quot;Nelson Gage&quot; of a few years later would settle on &quot;toque&quot;). The first &quot;Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles&quot; lists separate entries and definitions for both &quot;toque&quot; and &quot;tuque&quot; which cross-reference each other, though an illustrative line drawing is presented with the latter. Perhaps most importantly, the &quot;Canadian Oxford&quot; chose &quot;toque&quot;, and as the &quot;Canadian Press Stylebook&quot; bows to the &quot;Canadian Oxford&quot; as the final word in spelling, most Canadian publications have followed suit.

Though the requirement of the &quot;toque&quot; to have a pom-pom or no can be a hard line for some Canadians, for the most part the country agrees: one of these three spellings must be &quot;correct&quot; no matter what the specifics of shape. As the &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; claims, &quot;We all know a tuque when we see one, [we just] can&#x27;t agree on how to spell the word.&quot;

In recent years knit &quot;toques&quot; have resurfaced as an extremely popular fashion item. They are used all year round, seen not only used outdoors for weather but as an indoor fashion accessory.

Such hats are known in other English-speaking countries by a variety of names, including &quot;beanie&quot;, &quot;watch cap&quot; or &quot;stocking cap&quot;; the terms &quot;toque&quot; and &quot;tuque&quot; are unique to Canada and northern areas of the United States close to the Canada–United States border.

<text>Robert Jeffrey &quot;Bobby&quot; Hill (born August 13, 1985) is a fictional character on the Fox animated series &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and is voiced by Pamela Adlon. Bobby is the only child of Hank and Peggy Hill.

== Character biography ==
Robert Jeffrey &quot;Bobby&quot; Hill was born on August 13 in Arlen, Texas, as revealed in &quot;Shins of the Father&quot;. Bobby is 4&#x27;11&quot; (150 cm), below average height for his age, and is also overweight. Bobby is a school-aged boy who enjoys comedy, music, dance and socializing with his friends, Joseph Gribble and Connie Souphanousinphone. Although at times Bobby is seen as odd by his father and peers, he maintains a remarkable talent with people, particularly with girls, who find him cute and entertaining. Despite both of his parents being athletes, Bobby is inept at sports nor does he show any interest in it as a spectator. He is innocent, gentle, amicable, and good-natured. Though sometimes seen as a let-down, he does have a number of talents. Using these talents, Bobby aspires to be a prop comic like his comedic hero &quot;Celery Head&quot; (a parody of Carrot Top) and a &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot; (at times). Bobby displays a natural talent as a marksman, shown in &quot;How to Fire a Rifle Without Really Trying&quot; and &quot;To Kill a Ladybird&quot;. Bobby is generally very passive and is occasionally a victim of bullies, but maintains an overall high level of self-esteem. He is also the only person to whom Cotton Hill ever expresses genuine and unconditional affection, consistently supporting him and confiding in him throughout the series.

Bobby&#x27;s age progresses throughout the series. He starts out aged 11, turns 12 in &quot;Shins of the Father&quot; (the episode came out in 1997, putting his birthdate in 1985), turns 13 in &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Wait For Our Lives To Be Over&quot;, and is aged 13 for the rest of the series.

==Character analysis==
===Portrayal of children with ADHD===
In their book &quot;Abnormal Child Psychology,&quot; authors Eric J. Mash and David Allen Wolfe discussed the misconception that eating sugar contributes to ADD. Certain media portrayals, including the events surrounding Bobby in the episode &quot;Peggy&#x27;s Turtle Song&quot;, are noted. 
===Contrast to Bart Simpson===
In the book &quot;People of the Century&quot; by CBS News, they described Bobby as the &quot;anti-Bart&quot; (referring to Bart Simpson) while discussing how other characters have tried to &quot;claim Bart&#x27;s place of honor.&quot;

===Relationships===
Many episodes focus on the development of the relationship between Bobby and Hank. Bobby is not talented as an athlete or a craftsman like his father is, although he shows signs of being a talented golfer and shooter. As a result, Hank doubts his masculine identity and normalcy, tacitly and with side-of-the-mouth remarks, often lamenting &quot;That boy ain&#x27;t right.&quot; Apparently outside of Hank&#x27;s knowledge, Bobby does have the capability of physical anger, as when he twice punched the taller and stronger Joseph for kissing Connie. Bobby is saddened by his father&#x27;s lack of appreciation for the arts and his comedy routines. The two struggle to find common interests. However, Hank and Bobby find common interest in Texas, meat, propane, target shooting, hunting and golfing, among other things as the show progresses. Despite differences, Hank and Bobby have a close relationship. Bobby considers his father his hero. Although Bobby has a savant knack with shooting, it is one particular talent Hank does not have.

Writer Norm Hiscock told &quot;MEL Magazine&quot; that &quot;Bobby was a sensitive boy who was open to things, whereas Hank was more close-minded, so Bobby would drive him crazy. It was always a nice mash-up. That, for me, was the heart of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==
The &quot;London Free Press&quot; states that he &quot;arguably was the most interesting, complex and in some ways &#x27;real&#x27; kid in TV.&quot;

Voice actress Pamela Adlon received positive reception for her portrayal of Bobby. She received an Emmy for her role in the episode &quot;Bobby Goes Nuts&quot;, the only performer in the series to have won one for their role. IGN editor Talmadge Blevins quotes a line spoken by Bobby, &quot;That&#x27;s my purse! I don&#x27;t know you!&quot;, describing it as one of the &quot;most memorable lines ever uttered on television.&quot;

In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Bobby Hill number 48 on its &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list.

<text>The U.S. state of Kansas, located on the eastern edge of the Great Plains, was the home of nomadic Native American tribes who hunted the vast herds of bison (often called &quot;buffalo&quot;). In around 1450 AD, the Wichita People founded the great city of Etzanoa. The city of Etzanoa was abandoned in around 1700 AD. The region was explored by Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century. It was later explored by French fur trappers who traded with the Native Americans. Most of Kansas became permanently part of the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. When the area was opened to settlement by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 it became a battlefield that helped cause the American Civil War. Settlers from North and South came in order to vote slavery down or up. The free state element prevailed.

After the war, Kansas was home to frontier towns; their railroads were destinations for cattle drives from Texas. With the railroads came heavy immigration from the East, from Germany as well as some freedmen called &quot;Exodusters&quot;. Farmers first tried to replicate Eastern patterns and grow corn and raise pigs, but they failed because of shortages of rainfall. The solution, as James Malin showed, was to switch to soft spring wheat and later to hard winter wheat. The wheat was exported to Europe and was subject to wide variations in price. Many frustrated farmers joined the Populist movement around 1890, but conservative townspeople finally prevailed politically. They supported the progressive movement down to about 1940, but isolationism in foreign affairs combined with prosperity for the farmers and townsfolk made the state a center of conservative support for the Republican Party since 1940. Since 1945 the farm population has sharply declined and manufacturing has become more important, typified by the aircraft industry of Wichita.

==Prehistory==

===The Paleo-Indians and Archaic peoples===
Around 7000 BC, paleolithic descendants of Asian immigrants into North America reached Kansas. Once in Kansas, the indigenous ancestors never abandoned Kansas. They were later augmented by other indigenous peoples migrating from other parts of the continent. These bands of newcomers encountered mammoths, camels, ground sloths, and horses. The sophisticated big-game hunters did not keep a balance, resulting in the &quot;Pleistocene overkill&quot;, the rapid and systematic destruction of nearly all the species of large ice-age mammals in North America by 8000 BC. The hunters who pursued the mammoths may have represented the first of north Great Plains cycles of boom and bust, relentlessly exploiting the resource until it has been depleted or destroyed.

After the disappearance of big-game hunters, some archaic groups survived by becoming generalists rather than specialists, foraging in seasonal movements across the plains. The groups did not abandon hunting altogether, but also consumed wild plant foods and small game. Their tools became more varied, with grinding and chopping implements becoming more common, a sign that seeds, fruits, and greens constituted a greater proportion of their diet. Also, pottery-making societies emerged.

===Introduction of agriculture===
For most of the Archaic period, people did not transform their natural environment in any fundamental way. The groups outside the region, particularly in Mesoamerica, introduced major innovations, such as maize cultivation. Other groups in North America independently developed maize cultivation as well. Some archaic groups transferred from food gatherers to food producers around 3,000 years ago. They also possessed many of the cultural features that accompany semi-sedentary agricultural life: storage facilities, more permanent dwellings, larger settlements, and cemeteries or burial grounds. El Cuartelejo was the northernmost Indian pueblo. This settlement is the only pueblo in Kansas from which archaeological evidence has been recovered.

Despite the early advent of farming, late Archaic groups still exercised little control over their natural environment. Wild food resources remained important components of their diet even after the invention of pottery and the development of irrigation. The introduction of agriculture never resulted in the complete abandonment of hunting and foraging, even in the largest of Archaic societies.

==Etzanoa==

Etzanoa is an ancient city founded by the Wichita people in about 1450. Etzanoa is located in present-day Arkansas City, Kansas, near the Arkansas River.
In 1601, Juan de Oñate visited the city of Etzanoa. Oñate and the other explorers who accompanied him called the city &quot;the Great Settlement&quot;. Etzanoa may have been home to about 20,000 people at the time Oñate and his expedition found and explored the city.

==Early European exploration and local tribes==
In 1541, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, the Spanish conquistador, visited Kansas, allegedly turning back near &quot;Coronado Heights&quot; in present-day Lindsborg. Near the Great Bend of the Arkansas River, in a place he called &quot;Quivira&quot;, he met the ancestors of the Wichita people. Near the Smoky Hill River, he met the &quot;Harahey,&quot; who were probably the ancestors of the Pawnee. This was the first time that the Plains Indians had seen horses. Later, they acquired horses from the Spanish, and rapidly radically altered their lifestyle and range. 

Following this transformation, the Kansa (sometimes Kaw) and Osage Nation (originally Ouasash) arrived in Kansas in the 17th century. (The Kansa claimed that they occupied the territory since 1673.) By the end of the 18th century, these two tribes were dominant in the eastern part of the future state: the Kansa on the Kansas River to the North and the Osage on the Arkansas River to the South. At the same time, the Pawnee (sometimes Paneassa) were dominant on the plains to the west and north of the Kansa and Osage nations, in regions home to massive herds of bison. Europeans visited the Northern Pawnee in 1719. In 1720, the Spanish military&#x27;s Villasur expedition was wiped out by Pawnee and Otoe warriors near present-day Columbus, Nebraska, effectively ending Spanish expedition into the region. The French commander at Fort Orleans, Étienne de Bourgmont, visited the Kansas River in 1724 and established a trading post there, near the main Kansa village at the mouth of the river. Around the same time, the Otoe tribe also inhabited various areas around the northeast corner of Kansas.

==Louisiana Purchase==

Apart from brief explorations, neither France nor Spain had any settlement or military or other activity in Kansas. In 1763, following the Seven Years&#x27; War in which Great Britain defeated France, Spain acquired the French claims west of the Mississippi River. It returned this territory to France in 1803, keeping title to about .

In the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, the United States (US) acquired all of the French claims west of the Mississippi River; the area of Kansas was unorganized territory. In 1819 the United States confirmed Spanish rights to the as part of the Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain. That area became part of Mexico, which also ignored it. After the Mexican–American War and the US victory, the United States took over that part in 1848.

The Lewis and Clark Expedition left St. Louis on a mission to explore the Louisiana Purchase all the way to the Pacific Ocean. In 1804, Lewis and Clark camped for three days at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers in what is today Kansas City, Kansas (today commemorated at the Kaw Point Riverfront Park). They met French fur traders and mapped the area. In 1806, Zebulon Pike passed through Kansas and labeled it &quot;the Great American Desert&quot; on his maps. This view of Kansas would help form U.S. policy for the next 40 years, prompting the government to set it aside as land reserved for Native American resettlement.

From June 4, 1812, until August 10, 1821, the area that would become Kansas Territory 33 years later was part of the Missouri Territory. When Missouri was granted statehood in 1821 the area became unorganized territory and contained few if any permanent white settlers, except Fort Leavenworth. The Fort was established in 1827 by Henry Leavenworth with the 3rd U.S. Infantry from St. Louis, Missouri; it is the first permanent European settlement in Kansas. The fort was established as the westernmost outpost of the American military to protect trade along the Santa Fe Trail from Native Americans. The trade came from the East, by land using the Boone&#x27;s Lick Road, or by water via the Missouri River. This area, called the Boonslick, was located due east in west-central Missouri and was settled by Upland Southerners from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee as early as 1812. Its slave-owning population would contrast with settlers from New England who would eventually arrive in the 1850s.
A section of the Santa Fe Trail through Kansas was used by emigrants on the Oregon Trail, which opened in 1841. The westward trails served as vital commercial and military highways until the railroad took over this role in the 1860s. To travelers en route to Utah, California, or Oregon, Kansas was an essential way stop and outfitting location. Wagon Bed Spring (also Lower Spring or Lower Cimarron Spring) was an important watering spot on the Cimarron Cutoff of the Santa Fe Trail. Other important locations along the trail were the Point of Rocks and Pawnee Rock.

===1820s–1840s: Indian territory===
Beginning in the 1820s, the area that would become Kansas was set aside as Indian Territory by the U.S. government, and was closed to settlement by whites. The government resettled to Indian Territory (now part of Oklahoma) those Native American tribes based in eastern Kansas, principally the Kansa and Osage, opening land to move eastern tribes into the area. By treaty dated June 3, 1825, 20 million acres (81000 km2) of land was ceded by the Kansa Nation to the United States, and the Kansa tribe was limited to a specific reservation in northeast Kansas. In the same month, the Osage Nation was limited to a reservation in southeast Kansas.

The Missouri Shawano (or Shawnee) were the first Native Americans removed to the territory. By treaty made at St. Louis on November 7, 1825, the United States agreed to provide:
: &quot;&quot;the Shawanoe tribe of Indians within the State of Missouri, for themselves, and for those of the same nation now residing in Ohio who may hereafter immigrate to the west of the Mississippi, a tract of land equal to fifty miles [80 km] square, situated west of the State of Missouri, and within the purchase lately made from the Osage&quot;.&quot;

The Delaware came to Kansas from Ohio and other eastern areas by the treaty of September 24, 1829. The treaty described: 
: &quot;&quot;the country in the fork of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, extending up the Kansas River to the Kansas (Indian&#x27;s) line, and up the Missouri River to Camp Leavenworth, and thence by a line drawn westerly, leaving a space ten miles (16 km) wide, north of the Kansas boundary line, for an outlet&quot;.&quot;

After this point, the Indian Removal Act of 1830 expedited the process. By treaty dated August 30, 1831, the Ottawa ceded land to the United States and moved to a small reservation on the Kansas River and its branches. The treaty was ratified April 6, 1832. On October 24, 1832, the U.S. government moved the Kickapoos to a reservation in Kansas. On October 29, 1832, the Piankeshaw and Wea agreed to occupy 250 sections of land, bounded on the north by the Shawanoe; east by the western boundary line of Missouri; and west by the Kaskaskia and Peoria peoples. By treaty made with the United States on September 21, 1833, the Otoe tribe ceded their country south of the Little Nemaha River.

By September 17, 1836, the confederacy of the Sac and Fox, by treaty with the United States, moved north of Kickapoo. By treaty of February 11, 1837, the United States agreed to convey to the Pottawatomi an area on the Osage River, southwest of the Missouri River. The tract selected was in the southwest part of what is now Miami County.

In 1842, after a treaty between the United States and the Wyandots, the Wyandot moved to the junction of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers (on land that was shared with the Delaware until 1843). In an unusual provision, 35 Wyandot were given &quot;floats&quot; in the 1842 treaty – ownership of sections of land that could be located anywhere west of the Missouri River. In 1847, the Pottawatomi were moved again, to an area containing 576,000 acres (2,330 km2), being the eastern part of the lands ceded to the United States by the Kansa tribe in 1846. This tract comprised a part of the present counties of Pottawatomie, Wabaunsee, Jackson and Shawnee.

==Early 1850s and the territory organization==
Despite the treaties establishing Native American ownership of parts of Kansas, by 1850 European Americans were illegally squatting on their land and clamoring for the entire area to be opened for settlement. Presaging events that were soon to come, several U.S. Army forts, including Fort Riley, were soon established deep in Indian Territory to guard travelers on the various Western trails.

Although the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes were still negotiating with the United States for land in western Kansas (the current state of Colorado) – they signed a treaty on September 17, 1851 – momentum was already building to settle the land.

===Kansas–Nebraska Act===
Congress began the process of creating Kansas Territory in 1852. That year, petitions were presented at the first session of the Thirty-second Congress for a territorial organization of the region lying west of Missouri and Iowa. No action was taken at that time. However, during the next session, on December 13, 1852, a Representative from Missouri submitted to the House a bill organizing the Territory of Platte: all the tract lying west of Iowa and Missouri, and extending west to the Rocky Mountains. The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Territories, and passed by the full U.S. House of Representatives on February 10, 1853. However, Southern Senators stalled the progression of the bill in the Senate, while the implications of the bill on slavery and the Missouri Compromise were debated. Heated debate over the bill and other competing proposals would continue for a year, before eventually resulting in the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which became law on May 30, 1854, establishing the Nebraska Territory and Kansas Territory.

===Native American territory ceded===

Meanwhile, by the summer of 1853, it was clear that eastern Kansas would soon be opened to American settlers. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs negotiated new treaties that would assign new reservations with annual federal subsidies for the Indians. Nearly all the tribes in the eastern part of the Territory ceded the greater part of their lands prior to the passage of the Kansas territorial act in 1854, and were eventually moved south to the future state of Oklahoma.

In the three months immediately preceding the passage of the bill, treaties were quietly made at Washington with the Delaware, Otoe, Kickapoo, Kaskaskia, Shawnee, Sac, Fox and other tribes, whereby the greater part of eastern Kansas, lying within one or two hundred miles of the Missouri border, was suddenly opened to white settlement. (The Kansa reservation had already been reduced by treaty in 1846.) On March 15, 1854, Otoe and Missouri Indians ceded to the United States all their lands west of the Mississippi, except a small strip on the Big Blue River. On May 6 and May 10, 1854, the Shawnees ceded , reserving only for homes. Also on May 6, 1854, the Delaware ceded all their lands to the United States, except a reservation defined in the treaty. On May 17, the Iowa similarly ceded their lands, retaining only a small reservation. On May 18, 1854, the Kickapoo too ceded their lands, except in the western part of the Territory. In 1854 lands were also ceded by the Kaskaskia, Peoria, Piankeshaw and Wea and by the Sac and Fox.

The final step in Americanizing the Indians was taking land from tribal control and assigning it to individual Indian households, to buy and sell as European Americans would. For example, in 1854, the Chippewa (Swan Creek and Black River bands) inhabited in Franklin County, but in 1859 the tract was transferred to individual Chippewa families.

==Kansas Territory==
Upon the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act on May 30, 1854, the borders of Kansas Territory were set from the Missouri border to the summit of the Rocky Mountain range (now in central Colorado); the southern boundary was the 37th parallel north, the northern was the 40th parallel north. North of the 40th parallel was Nebraska Territory. When Congress set the southern border of the Kansas Territory as the 37th parallel, it was thought that the Osage southern border was also the 37th parallel. The Cherokees immediately complained, saying that it was not the true boundary and that the border of Kansas should be moved north to accommodate the actual border of the Cherokee land. This became known as the Cherokee Strip controversy.

===An invitation to violence===
The most controversial provision in the Kansas–Nebraska Act was the stipulation that settlers in Kansas Territory would vote on whether to allow slavery within its borders. This provision repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had prohibited slavery in any new states created north of latitude 36°30&#x27;. Predictably, violence resulted between the Northerners and Southerners who rushed to settle there in order to control the vote.

Within a few days after the passage of the Act, hundreds of pro-slavery Missourians crossed into the adjacent territory, selected an area of land, and then united with other Missourians in a meeting or meetings, intending to establish a pro-slavery preemption upon the entire region. As early as June 10, 1854, the Missourians held a meeting at Salt Creek Valley, a trading post three miles (5 km) west of Fort Leavenworth, at which a &quot;Squatter&#x27;s Claim Association&quot; was organized. They said they were in favor of making Kansas a slave state, if it should require half the citizens of Missouri, musket in hand, to emigrate there, and even to sacrifice their lives in accomplishing this end.

To counter this action, the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company (and other smaller organizations) quickly arranged to send anti-slavery settlers (known as &quot;Free-Staters&quot;) into Kansas in 1854 and 1855. The principal towns founded by the New Englanders were Topeka, Manhattan, and Lawrence. Several Free-State men also came to Kansas Territory from Ohio, Iowa, Illinois and other Midwestern states.

====Bleeding Kansas====
Despite the proximity and opposite aims of the settlers, the lid was largely kept on the violence until the election of the Kansas Territorial legislature on March 30, 1855. On that date, Missourians who had streamed across the border (known as &quot;Border Ruffians&quot;) filled the ballot boxes in favor of pro-slavery candidates. As a result, pro-slavery candidates prevailed at every polling district except one (the future Riley County), and the first official legislature was overwhelmingly composed of pro-slavery delegates.

From 1855 to 1858, Kansas Territory experienced extensive violence and some open battles. This period, known as &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; or &quot;the Border Wars&quot;, directly presaged the American Civil War. The major incidents of Bleeding Kansas include the Wakarusa War, the Sacking of Lawrence, the Pottawatomie massacre, the Battle of Black Jack, the Battle of Osawatomie, and the Marais des Cygnes massacre.

=====Wakarusa War=====

On December 1, 1855, a small army of Missourians, acting under the command of Douglas County, Kansas Sheriff Samuel J. Jones laid siege to the Free-State stronghold of Lawrence in what would later become known as &quot;The Wakarusa War&quot;. A treaty of peace negotiation was announced amid much disorder and cries for the reading of the treaty shortly afterwards. It quelled the disorder and its provisions were generally accepted.

=====Sacking of Lawrence=====

On May 21, 1856, pro-slavery forces led by Sheriff Jones attacked Lawrence, burning the Free-State Hotel to the ground, destroying two printing presses, and robbing homes.

=====Pottawatomie massacre=====

The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 to the morning of May 25, 1856. In what appears to be a reaction to the Sacking of Lawrence, John Brown and a band of abolitionists (some of them members of the Pottawatomie Rifles) killed five settlers, thought to be pro-slavery, north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas. Brown later said that he had not participated in the killings during the Pottawatomie massacre, but that he did approve of them. He went into hiding after the killings, and two of his sons, John Jr. and Jason, were arrested. During their confinement, they were allegedly mistreated, which left John Jr. mentally scarred. On June 2, Brown led a successful attack on a band of Missourians led by Captain Henry Pate in the Battle of Black Jack. Pate and his men had entered Kansas to capture Brown and others. That autumn, Brown went back into hiding and engaged in other guerrilla warfare activities.

====Territorial constitutions====

The violently feuding pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions tried to defeat the opposition by pushing through their own version of a state constitution, that would either endorse or condemn slavery. Congress had the final say.

=====Topeka Constitution=====
The Topeka Constitution was adopted on November 11, 1855, in Topeka by delegates elected from across the Kansas Territory. This Free State document was in response to the fraudulent takeover of the Territorial government by pro slavery forces seven months earlier. The Topeka Constitution&#x27;s Bill of Rights proposed &quot;There shall be no slavery in this state.&quot; It was ratified by the people of the Territory on December 15, 1855, and presented in Congress in March 1856. It passed in the U.S. House of Representatives but was prevented from a vote in the Senate by pro-slavery southern senators.

=====Lecompton Constitution=====
The Lecompton Constitution was adopted by a Convention convened by the official pro-slavery government on November 7, 1857. The constitution would have allowed slavery in Kansas as drafted, but the slavery provision was put to a vote. After a series of votes on the provision and the constitution were boycotted alternatively by pro-slavery settlers and Free-State settlers, the Lecompton Constitution was eventually presented to the U.S. Congress for approval. In the end, because it was never clear if the constitution represented the will of the people, it was rejected.

=====Leavenworth Constitution=====
While the Lecompton Constitution was being debated, a new Free-State legislature was elected and seated in Kansas Territory. The new legislature convened a new convention, which framed the Leavenworth Constitution. This constitution was the most radically progressive of the four proposed, outlawing slavery and providing a framework for women&#x27;s rights. The constitution was adopted by the convention at Leavenworth on April 3, 1858, and by the people at an election held May 18, 1858 (all while the Lecompton Constitution was still under consideration).

President Buchanan sent the Lecompton Constitution to Congress for approval. The Senate approved the admission of Kansas as a state under the Lecompton Constitution, despite the opposition of Senator Douglas, who believed that the Kansas referendum on the Constitution, by failing to offer the alternative of prohibiting slavery, was unfair. The measure was subsequently blocked in the House of Representatives, where northern congressmen refused to admit Kansas as a slave state. Senator James Hammond of South Carolina characterized this resolution as the expulsion of the state, asking, &quot;If Kansas is driven out of the Union for being a slave state, can any Southern state remain within it with honor?&quot;

=====Wyandotte Constitution=====
Following the failure of the Lecompton and Leavenworth charters, a fourth constitution was drafted; the Wyandotte Constitution was adopted by the convention which framed it on July 29, 1859. It was adopted by the people at an election held October 4, 1859. It outlawed slavery but was far less progressive than the Leavenworth Constitution. Kansas was admitted into the Union as a free state under this constitution on January 29, 1861.

===End of hostilities===
By the time the Wyandotte Constitution was adopted in October 1859, it was clear that the pro-slavery forces had lost control of Kansas. With this dawning realization and the departure of John Brown from the state, Bleeding Kansas violence virtually ended. The new issue was John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, a national event, later that month.

==Statehood==
Kansas became the 34th state admitted to the Union on January 29, 1861.

The 1860s saw several important developments in the history of Kansas, including participation in the Civil War, the beginning of the cattle drives, the roots of Prohibition in Kansas (which would fully take hold in the 1880s), and the start of the Indian Wars on the western plains. James Lane was elected to the Senate from the state of Kansas in 1861, and reelected in 1865.

===Civil War===

After years of small-scale civil war, Kansas was admitted into the Union as a free state under the &quot;Wyandotte Constitution&quot; on January 29, 1861. Most people gave strong support for the Union cause. However, guerrilla warfare and raids from pro-slavery forces, many spilling over from Missouri, occurred during the Civil War.

At the start of the war in April 1861, the Kansas government had no well-organized militia, no arms, accoutrements or supplies, nothing with which to meet the demands, except the united will of officials and citizens. During the years 1859 to 1860, the military organizations had fallen into disuse or been entirely broken up. The first Kansas regiment was called on June 3, 1861, and the seventeenth, the last raised during the Civil War, July 28, 1864. The entire quota assigned to the Kansas was 16,654, and the number raised was 20,097, leaving a surplus of 3,443 to the credit of Kansas. Statistics indicated that losses of Kansas regiments in killed in battle and from disease are greater per thousand than those of any other State.

Apart from small formal battles, there were 29 Confederate raids into Kansas during the war. The most serious episode came when Lawrence, Kansas came under attack on August 21, 1863, by guerrillas led by William Clarke Quantrill. It was in part retaliation for &quot;Jayhawker&quot; raids against pro-Confederate settlements in Missouri.

====Lawrence Massacre====
 
After Union Brigadier General Thomas Ewing Jr. ordered the imprisonment of women who had provided aid to Confederate guerrillas, tragically the jail&#x27;s roof collapsed, killing five. These deaths enraged guerrillas in Missouri. On August 21, 1863, William Quantrill led Quantrill&#x27;s Raid into Lawrence, burned much of the city and killed over 150 unarmed men and boys. In addition to the jail collapse, Quantrill also rationalized the attack on this citadel of abolition would bring revenge for any wrongs, real or imagined that the Southerners had suffered at the hands of Jayhawkers.

====Baxter Springs====
The Battle of Baxter Springs, sometimes called the Baxter Springs Massacre, was a minor battle in the War, fought on October 6, 1863, near the modern-day town of Baxter Springs, Kansas. The Battle of Mine Creek, also known as the Battle of the Osage was a cavalry battle that occurred in Kansas during the war.

====Marais des Cygnes====
On October 25, 1864, the Battle of Marais des Cygnes occurred in Linn County, Kansas. This Battle of Trading Post was between Major General Sterling Price and Union forces under Major General Alfred Pleasonton. Price, after fleeing south after a defeat at Kansas City, was pushed out by Union forces.

===Indian Wars in Kansas===

Fort Larned (central Kansas) was established in 1859 as a base of military operations against hostile Indians of the Central Plains, to protect traffic along the Santa Fe Trail and after 1861 became an agency for the administration of the Central Plains Indians by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the terms of the Fort Wise Treaty of 1861.

===Kansas Pacific railroad===
In 1863, the Union Pacific Eastern Division (renamed the Kansas Pacific in 1869) was authorized by the United States Congress&#x27;s Pacific Railway Act to create the southerly branch of the transcontinental railroad alongside the Union Pacific. Pacific Railway Act also authorized large land grants to the railroad along its mainline. The company began construction on its main line westward from Kansas City in September 1863.


In the postwar era, many railroads were planned, but not all were actually built. The nationwide Panic of 1873 dried up funding. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. In Kansas, nearly 5000 towns were mapped out, but by 1970 only 617 were actually operating. In the mid-20th century, closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether town would flourish or struggle for business.

===Cattle towns and Wild West===

After the Civil War, the railroads did not reach the main cattle-ranching areas in Texas, so cowboys brought cattle to Kansas rail heads. Initially this was via the Santa Fe Trail. 1867, Joseph G. McCoy built stockyards in Abilene, Kansas and helped develop the Chisholm Trail, encouraging Texas cattlemen to undertake cattle drives to his stockyards from 1867 to 1887. The stockyards became the largest west of Kansas City. Once the cattle had been driven north, they were shipped eastward from the railhead of the Kansas Pacific Railway.

Kansas in the 1870s was home to many storied Wild West figures. In 1871, Wild Bill Hickok became marshal of Abilene, Kansas. His encounter there with John Wesley Hardin resulted in the latter fleeing the town after Wild Bill managed to disarm him. Hickok was later a deputy marshal at Fort Riley and a marshal at Hays. Dodge City was home to both Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp, who worked as lawmen in the town. The Dalton Gang robbed trains and banks throughout Kansas and the Southwest and maintained a hideout in Meade. Coronado was involved in one of the bloodiest county seat fights in the history of the American West. The shoot-out on February 27, 1887, with boosters – some would say hired gunmen – from nearby Leoti left several people dead and wounded.

The Big Well at Greensburg, Kansas was built in the 1880s to provide water for the Santa Fe and Rock Island railroads. At deep and in diameter it is the world&#x27;s largest hand-dug well.

===Exodusters===
In 1879, after the end of Reconstruction in the South, thousands of Freedmen moved from Southern states to Kansas. Known as the Exodusters, they were lured by the prospect of good, cheap land and better treatment. The all-black town of Nicodemus, Kansas, which was founded in 1877, was an organized settlement that predates the Exodusters but is often associated with them.

===Prohibition===

On February 19, 1881, Kansas became the first state to amend its constitution to prohibit all alcoholic beverages. This action was spawned by the temperance movement, and was enforced by the ax-toting Carrie A. Nation beginning in 1888. After 1890 prohibition was joined with progressivism to create a reform movement that elected four successive governors between 1905 and 1919; they favored extreme prohibition enforcement policies, and claimed Kansas was truly dry. Kansas did not repeal prohibition until 1948, and even then it continued to prohibit public bars, a restriction which was not lifted until 1987. Kansas did not allow retail liquor sales on Sundays until 2005, and most localities still prohibit Sunday liquor sales. By the Alcohol laws of Kansas today 29 counties are dry counties.

===Religion===
The city of Topeka played a notable role in the history of American Christianity around the beginning of the 20th century. Charles Sheldon, a leader in the Social Gospel movement who first used the phrase What would Jesus do?, preached in Topeka. Topeka was also the home to the church of Charles Fox Parham, whom many historians associate with the beginning of the modern Pentecostalism movement.

==Farming==
===Environment===
Early settlers discovered that Kansas was not the &quot;Great American Desert&quot;, but they also found that the very harsh climate—with tornadoes, blizzards, drought, hail, floods and grasshoppers—made for the high risk of a ruined crop. Many early settlers were financially ruined, and especially in the early 1890s, either protested through the Populist movement or went back east. In the 20th century, crop insurance, new conservation techniques, and large-scale federal aid have lowered the risk. Immigrants, especially Germans and their children, comprised the largest element of settlers after 1860; they were attracted by the good soil, low priced lands from the railroad companies, and (if they were American citizens) the chance to homestead and receive title to the land at no cost from the federal government.

The problem of blowing dust came not because farmers grew too much wheat, but because the rainfall was too little to grow enough wheat to keep the topsoil from blowing away. In the 1930s techniques and technologies of soil conservation, most of which had been available but ignored before the Dust Bowl conditions began, were promoted by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the US Department of Agriculture, so that, with cooperation from the weather, soil condition was much improved by 1940.

===Farm life===
On the Great Plains very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling the paperwork and financial details. During the early years of settlement in the late 19th century, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement was promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools. 
Although the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm life, in reality rural folk created a rich social life for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food, and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees, Grange meeting, church activities, and school functions. The womenfolk organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families.

===Manufacturing farm equipment===
In 1947, Lyle Yost founded Hesston Manufacturing Company. It specialized in farm equipment, including self-propelled windrowers and the StakHand hay harvester. In 1974, Hesston Company commissioned its first belt buckles, which became popular on the rodeo circuit and with collectors. In 1991, the American-based equipment manufacturer AGCO Corporation purchased Hesston Corporation and farm equipment is still manufactured in the city.

===1890s===
In 1896 William Allen White, editor of the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot; attracted national attention with a scathing attack on William Jennings Bryan, the Democrats, and the Populists titled &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter With Kansas?&quot; White sharply ridiculed Populist leaders for letting Kansas slip into economic stagnation and not keeping up economically with neighboring states because their anti-business policies frightened away economic capital from the state. The Republicans sent out hundreds of thousands of copies of the editorial in support of William McKinley during the 1896 United States presidential election. While McKinley carried the small towns and cities of the state, Bryan swept the wheat farms and won the electoral vote, even as McKinley won the national vote.

==20th century==
===Progressive era===
Kansas was a center of the progressive movement, with enthusiastic support from the middle classes. Much of the leadership was provided by Republican newspaper editors, such as William Allen White of the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot;, Joseph L. Bristow of Salina, and Edward Hoch, of the &quot;Marion Record&quot;. Religion and gender played a role. Methodists and crusaders from the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) demanded the end of the liquor business. WCTU activists also became supporters of woman suffrage. White called for a direct primary because Republicans attended the Democratic caucus in order to nominate the weakest candidate; Democrats did the same and thus the weakest men get nominated and elected. A direct primary would let the Republicans voters select the best candidate for their party and likewise the Democrats. White never ran for office but Bristow was elected senator in 1908 and Hoch governor in 1904 and 1906. Hoch denounced the conservative wing of his party: it grows out of unwise leadership; of unfair standards of republicanism; of factional intolerance; of the multiplicity of useless offices; of extravagance in public expenditures; of enormous increase in burdens of taxation.

According to Craig Miner, the main issues of progressive era Kansas (in chronological order), were the flood of 1903, conservation, the battle to control Standard Oil in 1905, regulation of railroads and trusts, capital punishment, women&#x27;s rights, public health, urban reform, the Progressive Party campaign of 1912, and isolationism in foreign policy. In addition there was a long debate on the state purchase of school textbooks. The state wrote, printed and sold its school books until 1937. Supervision was lax and the textbooks were poorly done—filled with typos, grammatical errors, garbled passages and poor artwork. However, the state did save some money.

According to Gene Clanton, Populism and progressivism in Kansas had similarities but different bases of support. Both opposed corruption and trusts. Populism emerged earlier and came out of the farm community. It was radically egalitarian in favor of the disadvantaged classes; it was weak in the towns and cities except in labor unions. Progressivism, on the other hand, was a later movement. It emerged after the 1890s from the urban business and professional communities. Most of its activists had opposed populism. It was elitist, and emphasized education and expertise. Its goals were to enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and enlarge the opportunities for upward social mobility. However, some former Populists changed their emphasis after 1900 and supported progressive reforms.

The new city manager system was designed by progressives to increase efficiency and reduce partisanship and avoid the bribery of elected local officials. It was promoted in the press, led by Henry J. Allen of the &quot;Wichita Beacon,&quot; and pushed through by Governor Arthur Capper. By the 1980s 52 Kansas cities used the system.

===1910s===
In 1915, the El Dorado Oil Field, around the city of El Dorado, was the first oil field that was found using science/geologic mapping, and part of the Mid-Continent oil province. By 1918, the El Dorado Oil Field was the largest single field producer in the US, and was responsible for 12.8% of national oil production and 9% of the world production. It was deemed by some as &quot;the oil field that won World War I&quot;.

In World War I, 80,000 Kansans enlisted in the military after April, 1917 when the United States declared war on Germany. They were attached mostly to the 35th, the 42nd, the 89th, and the 92nd infantry divisions. The state&#x27;s large German element had favored neutrality and were under close watch. Often they were forced to buy war bonds or stop speaking German in public. German churches largely switched to English at this time. The intense nationalism of the war years undermined progressivism and led to conservative business dominance in the 1920s. However, the efficiency dimension persisted.

===1920s===
While urban Kansas prospered in the 1920s, the farm economy had overexpanded when wheat prices were high during the war, and had to cut back sharply. Many farmers took out large mortgages to buy out their neighbors in 1919, and now were hard pressed.

In 1922, suffragist Ella Uphay Mowry became the first female gubernatorial candidate in the state when she ran as &quot;Mrs. W.D. Mowry.&quot; She later stated that, &quot;Someone had to be the pioneer. I firmly believe that some day a woman will sit in the governor&#x27;s chair in Kansas.&quot;

The KKK (Ku Klux Klan) flourished briefly in the early 1920s. It faced several legal battles, and collapsed after 1925.

The flag of Kansas was designed in 1925. It was officially adopted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1927 and modified in 1961 (the word &quot;Kansas&quot; was added below the seal in gold block lettering). It was first flown at Fort Riley by Governor Ben S. Paulen in 1927 for the troops at Fort Riley and for the Kansas National Guard.

William Allen White in his novels and short stories, developed his idea of the small town as a metaphor for understanding social change and for preaching the necessity of community. While he expressed his views in terms of his small Kansas city, he tailored his rhetoric to the needs and values of all of urban America. The cynicism of the post-World War I world stilled his imaginary literature, but for the remainder of his life he continued to propagate his vision of small-town community. He opposed chain stores and mail order firms as a threat to the business owner on Main Street. The Great Depression shook his faith in a cooperative, selfless, middle-class America.

===Great depression===
The Dust Bowl was a series of dust storms caused by a massive drought that began in 1930 and lasted until 1941. The effect of the drought was overshadowed by the plunging wheat prices and the financial crisis of the Great Depression. Many local banks were forced to close. Some farmers left the land but even larger numbers of unemployed men left the cities to return to their family&#x27;s farm.

The state became an eager participant in such major New Deal relief programs as the Civil Works Administration, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, which put hundreds of thousands of Kansans—mostly men—to work at unskilled labor. Most important of all were the New Deal farm programs, which raised prices of wheat and other crops and allowed economic recovery by 1936. Republican Governor Alf Landon also employed emergency measures, including a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures and a balanced budget initiative. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration succeeded in raising wheat prices after 1933, thus alleviating the most serious distress.

===World War II===

The state&#x27;s main contribution to the war effort, besides tens of thousands of servicemen and servicewomen, was the enormous increase in the output of grain production. Farmers nevertheless grumbled about price ceilings for their wheat, production quotas, the movement of hired hands to well-paid factory jobs, and the shortage of farm machinery; they lobbied the Congress to make sure that young farmers were deferred from the draft.

Wichita, which had long shown an interest in aviation, became a major manufacturing center for the aircraft industry during the war, attracting tens of thousands of underemployed workers from the farms and small towns of the state.

The Women&#x27;s Land Army of America (WLA) was a wartime women&#x27;s labor pool organized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It failed to attract many town or city women to do farm work, but it succeeded in training several hundred farm wives in machine handling, safety, proper clothing, time-saving methods, and nutrition.

===Cold War era===
Kansas state law permitted segregated public schools, which operated in Topeka and other cities. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; unanimously declared that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal and, as such, violate the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees all citizens &quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot; &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot; explicitly outlawed &quot;de jure&quot; racial segregation of public education facilities (legal establishment of separate government-run schools for blacks and whites). The site consists of the Monroe Elementary School, one of the four segregated elementary schools for African American children in Topeka, Kansas (and the adjacent grounds).

During the 1950s and 1960s, intercontinental ballistic missiles (designed to carry a single nuclear warhead) were stationed throughout Kansas facilities. They were stored (to be launched from) hardened underground silos. The Kansas facilities were deactivated in the early 1980s.

On June 8, 1966, Topeka, Kansas was struck by an &quot;F5&quot; rated tornado, according to the Fujita scale. The &quot;1966 Topeka tornado&quot; started on the southwest side of town, moving northeast, hitting various landmarks (including Washburn University). Total dollar cost was put at $100 million.

===Recent personalities===
Kansas was home to President Eisenhower of Abilene, presidential candidates Bob Dole and Alf Landon, and the aviator Amelia Earhart. Famous athletes from Kansas include Barry Sanders, Gale Sayers, Jim Ryun, Walter Johnson, Clint Bowyer, Maurice Greene, and Lynette Woodard.

==Sports==
The Kansas Sports Hall of Fame chronicles the history of competitive athletics in the state.

===College sports===
:&quot;See also Timeline of college football in Kansas&quot;
Kansas sports history includes several significant firsts. The first college football game played in Kansas was the 1890 Kansas vs. Baker football game played in Baldwin City. Baker won 22–9. The first night football game west of the Mississippi was played in Wichita, Kansas in 1905 between Cooper College (now called Sterling College) and Fairmount College (now Wichita State University). Later that year, Fairmount also played an experimental game against the Washburn Ichabods that was used to test new rules designed to make football safer.

In 1911, the Kansas Jayhawks traveled to play the Missouri Tigers for what is considered the first homecoming game ever. The first college football homecoming game ever televised was played in Manhattan between the Kansas State Wildcats and the Nebraska Cornhuskers.

The 1951 season saw the Southwestern head coach Harold Hunt gain national recognition for rejecting a touchdown in a game against Central Missouri. Hunt informed the officials that his player had stepped out of bounds, nullifying long touchdown run. Not a single one of the referees had been in a position to see him do so, but they agreed to nullify the touchdown, and returned the ball to the point where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later confirmed Coach Hunt&#x27;s observation.

On October 2, 1970, a plane crashed that was carrying about half of the football team for Wichita State on their way to play a game against Utah State University. 31 people were killed. The game was canceled, and the Utah State football team held a memorial service at the stadium where the game was to have been played.

===Professional sports===
The history of professional sports in Kansas probably dates from the establishment of the Minor League Baseball Topeka Capitals and Leavenworth Soldiers in 1886 in the Western League. The African-American Bud Fowler played on the Topeka team that season, one year before the &quot;color line&quot; descended in professional baseball.

In 1887, the Western League was dominated by a reorganized Topeka team called the Golden Giants – a high-priced collection of major leaguer players, including Bug Holliday, Jim Conway, Dan Stearns, Perry Werden and Jimmy Macullar, which won the league by 15½ games. On April 10, 1887, the Golden Giants also won an exhibition game from the defending World Series champions, the St. Louis Browns (the present-day Cardinals), by a score of 12–9. However, Topeka was unable to support the team, and it disbanded after one year.

The first night game in the history of professional baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930, when the Muscogee (Oklahoma) Indians beat the Independence Producers 13 to 3 in a minor league game sanctioned by the Western League of the Western Baseball Association with 1,500 fans attending the game. The permanent lighting system was first used for an exhibition game on April 17, 1930, between the Independence Producers and House of David semi-professional baseball team of Benton Harbor, Michigan with the Independence team winning with a score of 9 to 1 before a crowd of 1,700 spectators.

<doc id="319304" wikidata="Q1049322" url="?curid=319304" title="Unicron">
<text>Unicron is a fictional villain from the &quot;Transformers&quot; media franchise. Designed by Floro Dery, he was introduced in the 1986 animated film &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; and has since reappeared in &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and Atari&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Transformers&quot; video game. Unicron is a prodigiously large robot whose scale reaches planetary proportions; he also able to transform into a giant planet. Unicron&#x27;s origin has expanded over the years from simply being a large robot to being a god of chaos who devours realities. He often employs the help of Decepticons in his work, and in some stories is considered part of the origin of the Decepticon forces.

==Fictional character biography==
According to the Transformers lore, before the dawn of time, Order and Chaos exist within an extra-dimensional entity known as The One. To explore the fledgling universe, he creates the astral being known as Unicron, and then subdivides him, creating his twin, Primus.

==Physical dimensions==
Unicron&#x27;s size is never specified in any canon materials, aside from the vague term &quot;planet size&quot;. In &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, Unicron&#x27;s height appears to be anywhere from several kilometers (as when handling Galvatron) to several hundred kilometers (as when attacking and destroying Lithone and Cybertron&#x27;s moons, and attacking Cybertron). A planet-mode diameter of has been suggested and robot-mode dimensions can follow from that estimate, provided that there is no change in size (compression or expansion) common among so many Transformers. One scene in the movie shows Jazz driving out of one of Unicron&#x27;s eyes, just small enough to fit through them, though in another scene the Quintesson ship Hot Rod arrived in is tiny compared with the eye. Unicron is also small enough to stand on Cybertron&#x27;s surface.

==Animated series==
===&quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;===
The character Unicron first appears in the opening scene of 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, immediately making clear his goal by consuming the small world of Lithone. Subsequently, when the Decepticons Megatron, Skywarp, Thundercracker, and the Insecticons are set adrift in space and left to die following a furious battle with the Autobots, Unicron appears before them and offers Megatron a deal: in exchange for a new body, and new troops, Megatron will destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, the only thing that can stand in Unicron&#x27;s way. Thus, Unicron rebuilds Megatron into a new and more powerful body and rechristens him Galvatron. He then uses the battered bodies of the other Decepticons and creates Scourge, the Sweeps and Cyclonus. Unicron also gives Galvatron a vessel, and Galvatron begins to carry out his assigned task, although he is loath to do so. When Galvatron shows any signs of opposition to Unicron&#x27;s will, Unicron inflicts agonizing torture in his mind to coerce him into obedience.

Following Unicron&#x27;s consumption of Cybertron&#x27;s two moons, Galvatron obtains the Matrix from Ultra Magnus, believing he can use it to bring Unicron under his control. Attempting to open the Matrix to intimidate Unicron, Galvatron only prompts his transformation into robot mode and is swallowed by the planet-eater. Unicron lays waste to Cybertron, halted briefly when the young Autobot rookie, Hot Rod, crashes a Quintesson spacecraft through his eye. Finding Hot Rod inside Unicron&#x27;s body, Galvatron suggests an alliance against their common enemy. However, Unicron inflicts his mental torture upon Galvatron, forcing him to fight Hot Rod. Hot Rod seizes the Matrix from Galvatron during the fight and becomes Rodimus Prime. Rodimus throws Galvatron into space, freeing him from Unicron&#x27;s mind-control. Rodimus opens the Matrix within Unicron, destroying his body, leaving only his head, which becomes a moon of Cybertron.

Unicron was voiced by Orson Welles.

The third season of &quot;The Transformers&quot; animated series continues Unicron&#x27;s story where the movie left off, as the planet-eater&#x27;s deactivated head settles into orbit around Cybertron. His head is visited by Cyclonus, who accesses the memory bank to discern the fate of Galvatron. Later, the ghost of the deceased Decepticon Starscream reactivates Unicron&#x27;s head and enters into a bargain with him, performing three labors in exchange for the restoration of his body. Starscream (inhabiting and controlling Scourge&#x27;s body) gathers for Unicron Metroplex&#x27;s eyes (breaking one and replacing it with one from Trypticon) and Trypticon&#x27;s transformation cog. He begins to connect his head to Cybertron, which would become Unicron&#x27;s new body. Starscream demands that Unicron restore his own body so that he can complete the required connections. Once Unicron does so, Starscream double-crosses him and refuses to finish the job. Unicron&#x27;s head is subsequently blown off into space by an explosion instigated by the Autobots.

Later, when searching for a new supply of positrons (anti-electrons), the Decepticons venture to Unicron&#x27;s head, where Cyclonus and Scourge accidentally awake the slumbering demi-god. At the same time, Grimlock constructs the Technobots from pieces of Unicron&#x27;s head, and one of their number, Strafe, severs enough of Unicron&#x27;s neural connections to shut him back down.

Although Unicron himself does not appear again, his origin in the animated series is later revealed. Unicron was created near the beginning of the universe by the diminutive genius known as Primacron, who intended for him to devour all life in the universe, leaving a blank slate that Primacron could use as he saw fit. However, Unicron turned upon Primacron, deciding that &quot;he&quot; would rule the universe and subsequently set out to achieve that goal.

===Unicron trilogy===
Unicron would appear in &quot;Transformers Armada&quot;, voiced by Mark Acheson. In episode 23, several of the human allies discover Sideways within their computers, and attempt to stop him, but not before learning that his accomplice was Unicron within the mainframe acting as a failsafe. The final season depicts Unicron as the main antagonist. Called the &quot;Unicron Battles&quot;, the Transformers Earth groups return to Cybertron. The humans learn Unicron had made the Minicons to take control of Cybertron, but the Minicons revolted and become part of the Transformers&#x27; own civil war.

Unicron appears in the sequel series &quot;&quot;, set 10 years after the Unicron Battles. The autobots successfully destroy Unicron, but Unicron manages to place his consciousness within Megatron. In the final episode, Megatron is corrupted by Unicron, leading to another confrontation with Optimus Supreme. Around this time, Primus, Unicron&#x27;s sibling, creates an energon sun and attempts to trap Unicron&#x27;s soul with it. Both he and Megatron are destroyed for good, and the energon sun recreates Alpha&#x27;s planets that were destroyed long ago.

===&quot;Aligned&quot; continuity===
In the &quot;&quot; storyline, Unicron (voiced by John Noble) is the source of Dark Energon, a poisonous and corruptive form of Energon with the ability to revive the dead - albeit in a mindless, zombie-like &quot;Terrorcon&quot; state - also known by the name &quot;the blood of Unicron&quot;. Unicron is believed to represent the Anti-Spark (most likely a counterpart of the AllSpark).

==Publication history==
===Fun Publications===
When Unicron attacks Cybertron in the midst of the chaos caused by a Mini-Con civil war, Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime fight him off with the help of their allies. In the end Unicron is driven off, badly wounded, by Primus.

===Unite Warriors===
In conjunction with the Unite Warriors line, Takara Tomy released a comic detailing how the Galvatronus combiner came to be. Following his defeat at the conclusion of &quot;The Headmasters&quot;, Galvatron&#x27;s icy tomb is discovered by Cyclonus, whose body Galvatron modifies to accommodate his own head in the chest compartment. Seeking a more fitting form, Galvatron directs Cyclonus to approach the disembodied head of Unicron, who is convinced to help Galvatron attain a combiner form with Cyclonus as its core. To accomplish this, Unicron opens dimensional rifts in order to bring Curse Armada Thrust, Zombie War Breakdown, and Wandering Roller into their world. To Cyclonus&#x27; surprise, Starscream makes an appearance, expressing interest in joining this new alliance. Unicron grants Starscream a new physical form, and Galvatron&#x27;s head takes control of his new minions to take on his new form of Galvatronus.

==Film series==
Debuting in &quot;&quot;, the six horns of Unicron began appearing out of the Earth in response to the approach of Cybertron. Unicron is noted by Quintessa to be another name for Earth, and Optimus Prime recognizes Unicron as Cybertron&#x27;s ancient enemy. Quintessa plans to drain Unicron&#x27;s energy to restore the damaged Cybertron, killing life on Earth in the process. Simmons later helps Burton locate an ancient book containing details about Unicron, noting that the center-point of Unicron&#x27;s horns (during the era when all of the Earth&#x27;s continents formed Pangaea) is Stonehenge. Megatron and Quintessa begin draining energy from Unicron but are foiled, and later Quintessa (disguised as a human) approaches a scientist studying one of Unicron&#x27;s horns to warn him not to touch the chaos-bringer and offers a way to kill him.

Unicron appears in the 2023 film &quot;&quot;, voiced by Colman Domingo. In the film, he is a planet-eater who consumes them as fuel. Devouring the home planet of the Maximals, who escape with the Transwarp Key to Earth, he sends his Terrorcon servants to find it. After the Terrorcons obtain the two halves of the key, Unicron emerges through a portal near Earth, intent on devouring the planet. However, Optimus Prime destroys the key, collapsing the portal and trapping Unicron in the other side.

==Video games==
Unicron is among the characters appearing in the 2004 &quot;Transformers&quot; video game for the PlayStation 2, and served as the main final boss in the game. Unicron begins attacking Cybertron, requiring the Autobots to collect enough Mini-cons to create a power-up mode for Optimus Prime. The player must chase Unicron as he orbits around Cybertron and enters his maw as he prepares to fire, blasting him with the Matrix Cannon until eventually Unicron is destroyed.

Unicron is mentioned a number of times in &quot;&quot;. Eons ago, Unicron created Thunderwing to serve him and destroy the Matrix of Leadership. After Unicron&#x27;s demise, a meteor of Dark Energon with Thunderwing sealed within crashes on Earth. Optimus Prime comes across the meteor and finds Thunderwing who reveals that he is a minion of Unicron and his mission was to destroy the Matrix. Thunderwing seeks help from the Decepticons for the repairs needed. He fails thanks to the combined efforts of Prime and Jack Darby and falls into a volcano.

==Toys==
* &quot;Armada&quot; Unicron with Dead End (2003)
:The &quot;Armada&quot; figure came with its own Mini-Con, which transforms into a cannon-equipped &#x27;moon&#x27; to Unicron&#x27;s &#x27;planet&#x27;, looking very similar to the Death Star of &quot;Star Wars&quot; fame. At various points in production, Unicron&#x27;s Mini-Con was originally going to be called Nebulon, the name of the homeworld of the Headmaster, Targetmaster and Powermaster partners, and also Gobotron, the homeworld of the Transformers&#x27; competitive toyline in the 80&#x27;s, the &quot;Go-Bots&quot;. Designer Aaron Archer did not want such a historical action figure to be overshadowed by a Go-Bots pun, so the name was changed to Dead End, re-using a name of one of the original Stunticons. A multitude of these Mini-Cons was featured in the &quot;Armada&quot; cartoon, although they were portrayed simply as non-transforming internal defensive &quot;laser pods,&quot; instead of actual Mini-Cons.
:This toy was voted the 52nd top toy released in the last 10 years by &quot;ToyFare&quot; magazine.

* &quot;Cybertron&quot; Deluxe Unicron (2005)
:A Deluxe size figure. The figure was packaged on a Decepticon cardback, and that the character&#x27;s profile in the &quot;Transformers Collectors&#x27; Club&quot; magazine also included a Decepticon symbol. The actual story featuring the character, however, presents him as unaffiliated, serving only his own ends. In line with this, the toy lacks a faction symbol - a rare but not unheard of occurrence in the Transformers line, with examples including Micromasters, the Go-Bots, &quot;Cybertron&quot; Safeguard, SDCC exclusive Skywarp, and movie .

* &quot;Titanium&quot; 3 inch Unicron
:A three-inch tall Decepticon which doesn&#x27;t transform. It is packaged holding one of Cybertron&#x27;s moons.

* &quot;Robot Heroes&quot; Optimus Prime and Unicron
:Unicron is sold as a Decepticon, one half of a two-pack.

* &quot;Transformers 2010&quot; Unicron (2010)
:A redeco and remold of the &quot;Armada&quot; Unicron figure was released in late 2010 as part of Takara Tomy&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to Transformers 2010&quot; promotion, which celebrates the year in which the third season of &quot;The Transformers&quot; was set in Japan. Designed to resemble Unicron as seen in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, pre-release photos issued by Takara Tomy show a new head and changes to the molding of the torso, as well as deco based on his movie appearance. He retains the Mini-Con partner.

* &quot;Generations&quot; 25th Anniversary Unicron (2011)
:The U.S. release of the 2010 Unicron redeco is an Amazon.com exclusive to commemorate the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;. The included Dead End Mini-Con is renamed Kranix (after the last remaining inhabitant of the planet Lithone).

*&quot;Transformers&quot; Siege War For Cybertron Unicron (2019)
:A 27-inch tall figure that weighs 19 pounds (8.6 kg), the tallest transformer to-date. From the &quot;&quot; series and the widest diameter of any transformers figure with 30 inches, a larger diameter than the previous record holder () by over 4 inches. It is sold with interchangeable chins, and can be switched between a smooth chin and a goatee-style chin, reminiscient of The Transformers: The Movie. The figure also comes with a custom stand as well as a mini &quot;Decepticon&quot; Galvatron figure.

<doc id="319308" wikidata="Q3706807" url="?curid=319308" title="Posthumous Diary">
<text>Posthumous Diary (&quot;Diario postumo&quot;) is a series of poems attributed to the Italian poet Eugenio Montale which first appeared in full in 1996 (see 1996 in poetry). It was purported to be conceived as a literary time-bomb carried out with the help of a young fan, Annalisa Cima.

In 1969 Montale began to give a poem to Cima at each meeting. In 1979 he divided the poems into eleven envelopes. Ten (numbered I to X) contained six poems each, while the eleventh contained another packet of six poems (numbered XI) as well as eighteen additional poems for three further envelopes. Montale entrusted the collection to Cima under the condition that they would not appear until after his death.

In 1986 the Schlesinger Foundation began issuing a limited edition series of booklets, numbered I to XI, for each group of six poems. A twelfth volume appeared in 1996 with the remaining eighteen poems, and in the same year followed a collection of the entire series published by Mondadori.

The work immediately caused a scandal in Italian literary circles. Some critics believed that the poems were composed by Cima out of conversations with Montale, while others believed Cima had forged them outright. Maria Corti, a professor of philology at the University of Pavia to whose library Montale had donated most of his papers, publicly stated that Montale had told her about the poems, which he intended as a practical joke on his critics (http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1997/09/04/montale-dopo-il-parapiglia.html?refresh_ce). The critic Dante Isella thinks that this work is not authentic. 
More recently, many doubts (based on stylometric, graphologic and archival considerations) concerning authenticity have been expressed during a congress held in Bologna (http://corrieredibologna.corriere.it/bologna/notizie/cultura/2014/7-novembre-2014/diario-postumo-montale-falso-filologo-condello-abbiamo-prove-230495319702.shtml). But the matter remains controversial.

&quot;Posthumous Diary&quot; was translated into English by Jonathan Galassi and published in 2001.

<doc id="319319" wikidata="Q576507" url="?curid=319319" title="Pigalle, Paris">
<text>Pigalle () is an area in Paris, France, around the Place Pigalle, on the border between the 9th and the 18th arrondissements. It is named after the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Pigalle (1714–1785).

Pigalle is famous for being a tourist district, with many sex shops, theatres and adult shows on Place Pigalle and the main boulevards. The neighbourhood&#x27;s raunchy reputation led to its Second World War nickname of &quot;Pig Alley&quot; by Allied soldiers. Le Divan du Monde and the Moulin Rouge, a world-famous cabaret, are both located in Pigalle.

==History==
Henri Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s studio was here. Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh and Maurice Neumont also lived here, as did André Breton, and in 1928 Josephine Baker opened her first nightclub next door to Breton&#x27;s apartment.

American-born jazz singer Adelaide Hall lived in Pigalle in 1937–1938 and opened her nightclub &quot;La Grosse Pomme&quot; (&quot;the Big Apple&quot;) at 73 Rue Pigalle. Other nightclubs in Rue Pigalle during the late 1930s included the &quot;Moon Rousse&quot; and &quot;Caravan&quot;, where Django Reinhardt played.

It was the home of the Grand Guignol theatre, which closed in 1962. However, the theatre building still stands.

Pigalle is well known to tourists who want to experience &quot;Paris by night&quot;. It is home to some of Paris&#x27; most famous cabarets (the Moulin Rouge, for instance, was immortalised by artist Toulouse-Lautrec as well as Hollywood), as well as topless and nude shows.

The area to the south of Place Pigalle is devoted to musical instruments and equipment shops, especially for popular music. A section of the rue de Douai consists solely of stores selling guitars, drums and musical accessories.

Pigalle is one end-point of the Montmartrobus (a public bus serving the area) and is at the Pigalle stop of the Paris Métro.

<text>On March 1, 1932, Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. (born June 22, 1930), the 20-month-old son of Col. Charles Lindbergh and his wife, aviator and author Anne Morrow Lindbergh, was murdered after being abducted from his crib in the upper floor of the Lindberghs&#x27; home, Highfields, in East Amwell, New Jersey, United States. On May 12, the child&#x27;s corpse was discovered by a truck driver by the side of a nearby road.

In September 1934, a German immigrant carpenter named Bruno Richard Hauptmann was arrested for the crime. After a trial that lasted from January 2 to February 13, 1935, he was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Despite his conviction, he continued to profess his innocence, but all appeals failed and he was executed in the electric chair at the New Jersey State Prison on April 3, 1936. Hauptmann&#x27;s guilt or lack thereof continues to be debated in the modern day. Newspaper writer H. L. Mencken called the kidnapping and trial &quot;the biggest story since the Resurrection&quot;. American media called it the &quot;crime of the century&quot;; legal scholars have referred to the trial as one of the &quot;trials of the century&quot;. The crime spurred the U.S. Congress to pass the Federal Kidnapping Act (commonly referred to as the &quot;Little Lindbergh Law&quot;), which made transporting a kidnapping victim across state lines a federal crime.

==Kidnapping==
At approximately 9 p.m. on March 1, 1932, the Lindberghs&#x27; nurse, Betty Gow, found that 20-month-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. was not with his mother, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, who had just come out of the bath. Gow then alerted Charles Lindbergh who immediately went to the child&#x27;s room, where he found a ransom note, containing poor handwriting and grammar, in an envelope on the windowsill. Taking a gun, Lindbergh went around the house and grounds with the family butler, Olly Whateley; they found impressions in the ground under the window of the baby&#x27;s room, pieces of a wooden ladder, and a baby&#x27;s blanket. Whateley telephoned the Hopewell police department while Lindbergh contacted his attorney and friend, Henry Breckinridge, and the New Jersey state police.

==Investigation==

An extensive search of the home and its surrounding area was conducted by police from nearby Hopewell Borough in coordination with the New Jersey State Police.

After midnight, a fingerprint expert examined the ransom note and ladder; no usable fingerprints or footprints were found, leading experts to conclude that the kidnapper(s) wore gloves and had some type of cloth on the soles of their shoes. No adult fingerprints were found in the baby&#x27;s room, including in areas witnesses admitted to touching, such as the window, but the baby&#x27;s fingerprints were found.

The brief, handwritten ransom note had many spelling and grammar irregularities:

At the bottom of the note were two interconnected blue circles surrounding a red circle, with a hole punched through the red circle and two more holes to the left and right.

On further examination of the ransom note by professionals, they found that it was all written by the same person. They determined that due to the odd English, the writer must have been foreign and had spent some time in the United States but little. The FBI then found a sketch artist to make a portrait of the man that they believed to be the kidnapper.

Another attempt at identifying the kidnapper was made by examining the ladder that was used in the crime to abduct the child. Police realized that while the ladder was built incorrectly, it was built by someone who knew how to construct with wood and had prior building experience. No fingerprints were found on the ladder. Slivers of the wood were examined, as the police believed that this evidence would lead to the kidnapper. They had a professional see how many different types of wood were used, what pattern was made by the nail holes and if it had been made indoors or outdoors. This was later a key element in the trial of the man who was charged with the kidnapping.

On March 2, 1932, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover contacted the Trenton New Jersey Police Department. He told the New Jersey police that they could contact the FBI for any resources and would provide any assistance if needed. The FBI did not have federal jurisdiction until May 13, 1932 when the President declared that the FBI was at the disposal of the New Jersey Police Department and that the FBI should coordinate and conduct the investigation.

The New Jersey State police offered a $25,000 reward, , for anyone who could provide information pertaining to the case.

On March 4, 1932 a man by the name of Gaston B. Means had a discussion with Evalyn Walsh McLean and told her that he would be of great importance in retrieving the Lindbergh baby. Means told McLean that he could find these kidnappers because he was approached weeks before the abduction about participating in a &quot;big kidnapping&quot; and he claimed that his friend was the kidnapper of the Lindbergh child. The following day, Means told McLean that he had made contact with the person who had the Lindbergh child. He then convinced Mrs. McLean to give him $100,000 to obtain the child because the ransom money had doubled. McLean obliged, believing that Means really knew where the child was. She waited for the child&#x27;s return every day until she finally asked Means for her money back. When he refused, Mrs. McLean reported him to the police and he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison on embezzlement charges.

Violet Sharpe, who was suspected as a conspirator, died by suicide on June 10, before she was scheduled to be questioned for the fourth time. Her involvement was later ruled out due to her having an alibi for the night of March 1, 1932.

In October 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt announced that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would take jurisdiction over the case.

===Prominence===
Word of the kidnapping spread quickly. Hundreds of people converged on the estate, destroying any footprint evidence. Along with police, well-connected and well-intentioned people arrived at the Lindbergh estate. Military colonels offered their aid, although only one had law enforcement expertiseHerbert Norman Schwarzkopf, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police. The other colonels were Henry Skillman Breckinridge, a Wall Street lawyer; and William J. Donovan, a hero of the First World War who later headed the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA. Lindbergh and these men speculated that the kidnapping was perpetrated by organized crime figures. They thought that the letter was written by someone who spoke German as his native language. At this time, Charles Lindbergh used his influence to control the direction of the investigation.

They contacted Mickey Rosner, a Broadway hanger-on rumored to know mobsters. Rosner turned to two speakeasy owners, Salvatore &quot;Salvy&quot; Spitale and Irving Bitz, for aid. Lindbergh quickly endorsed the duo and appointed them his intermediaries to deal with the mob. Several organized crime figures – notably Al Capone, Willie Moretti, Joe Adonis, and Abner Zwillman – spoke from prison, offering to help return the baby in exchange for money or for legal favors. Specifically, Capone offered assistance in return for being released from prison under the pretense that his assistance would be more effective. This was quickly denied by the authorities.
The morning after the kidnapping, authorities notified President Herbert Hoover of the crime. At that time, kidnapping was classified as a state crime and the case did not seem to have any grounds for federal involvement. Attorney General William D. Mitchell met with Hoover and announced that the whole machinery of the Department of Justice would be set in motion to cooperate with the New Jersey authorities.

The Bureau of Investigation (later the FBI) was authorized to investigate the case, while the United States Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Immigration Service and the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia were told their services might be required. New Jersey officials announced a $25,000 reward for the safe return of &quot;Little Lindy&quot;. The Lindbergh family offered an additional $50,000 reward of their own. At this time, the total reward of $75,000 (approximately $1,801,000 in 2024) was a tremendous sum of money, because the nation was in the midst of the Great Depression.

On March 6, a new ransom letter arrived by mail at the Lindbergh home. The letter was postmarked March 4 in Brooklyn, and it carried the perforated red and blue marks. The ransom had been raised to $70,000. A third ransom note postmarked from Brooklyn, and also including the secret marks, arrived in Breckinridge&#x27;s mail. The note told the Lindberghs that John Condon should be the intermediary between the Lindberghs and the kidnapper(s), and requested notification in a newspaper that the third note had been received. Instructions specified the size of the box the money should come in, and warned the family not to contact the police.

===John Condon===
During this time, John F. Condona well-known Bronx personality and retired school teacheroffered $1,000 if the kidnapper would turn the child over to a Catholic priest. Condon received a letter reportedly written by the kidnappers; it authorized Condon to be their intermediary with Lindbergh. Lindbergh accepted the letter as genuine.

Following the kidnapper&#x27;s latest instructions, Condon placed a classified ad in the &quot;New York American&quot; reading: &quot;Money is Ready. Jafsie.&quot; Condon then waited for further instructions from the culprits.

A meeting between &quot;Jafsie&quot; and a representative of the group that claimed to be the kidnappers was eventually scheduled for late one evening at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. According to Condon, the man sounded foreign but stayed in the shadows during the conversation, and Condon was thus unable to get a close look at his face. The man said his name was John, and he related his story: He was a &quot;Scandinavian&quot; sailor, part of a gang of three men and two women. The baby was being held on a boat, unharmed, but would be returned only for ransom. When Condon expressed doubt that &quot;John&quot; actually had the baby, he promised some proof: the kidnapper would soon return the baby&#x27;s sleeping suit. The stranger asked Condon, &quot;... would I burn if the package were dead?&quot; When questioned further, he assured Condon that the baby was alive.

On March 16, Condon received a toddler&#x27;s sleeping suit by mail, and a seventh ransom note. After Lindbergh identified the sleeping suit, Condon placed a new ad in the &quot;Home News&quot;: &quot;Money is ready. No cops. No secret service. I come alone, like last time.&quot; On April 1 Condon received a letter saying it was time for the ransom to be delivered.

=== Ransom payment ===
The ransom was packaged in a wooden box that was custom-made in the hope that it could later be identified. The ransom money included a number of gold certificates; since gold certificates were about to be withdrawn from circulation, it was hoped greater attention would be drawn to anyone spending them. The bills were not marked but their serial numbers were recorded. Some sources credit this idea to Frank J. Wilson, others to Elmer Lincoln Irey.

On April 2, Condon was given a note by an intermediary, an unknown cab driver. Condon met &quot;John&quot; and told him that they had been able to raise only $50,000. The man accepted the money and gave Condon a note saying that the child was in the care of two innocent women.

===Discovery of the body===

On May 12, delivery truck driver Orville Wilson and his assistant William Allen pulled to the side of a road about south of the Lindbergh home near the hamlet of Mount Rose in neighboring Hopewell Township. When Allen went into a grove of trees to urinate, he discovered the body of a toddler. The skull was badly fractured and the body decomposed, with evidence of scavenging by animals; there were indications of an attempt at a hasty burial. Gow identified the baby as the missing infant from the overlapping toes of the right foot and a shirt that she had made. It appeared the child had been killed by a blow to the head. Lindbergh insisted on cremation.

In June 1932, officials began to suspect that the crime had been perpetrated by someone the Lindberghs knew. Suspicion fell upon Violet Sharpe, a British household servant at the Morrow home who had given contradictory information regarding her whereabouts on the night of the kidnapping. It was reported that she appeared nervous and suspicious when questioned. She died by suicide on June 10, 1932, by ingesting a silver polish that contained cyanide just before being questioned for the fourth time. Her alibi was later confirmed, and police were criticized for heavy-handedness.

Condon was also questioned by police and his home searched, but nothing incriminating was found. Charles Lindbergh stood by Condon during this time.

===John Condon&#x27;s unofficial investigation===
After the discovery of the body, Condon remained unofficially involved in the case. To the public, he had become a suspect and in some circles was vilified. For the next two years, he visited police departments and pledged to find &quot;Cemetery John&quot;.

Condon&#x27;s actions regarding the case were increasingly flamboyant. On one occasion, while riding a city bus, Condon claimed that he saw a suspect on the street and, announcing his secret identity, ordered the bus to stop. The startled driver complied and Condon darted from the bus, although his target eluded him. Condon&#x27;s actions were also criticized as exploitive when he agreed to appear in a vaudeville act regarding the kidnapping. &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine published a serialized account of Condon&#x27;s involvement in the Lindbergh kidnapping under the title &quot;Jafsie Tells All&quot;.

===Tracking the ransom money===

The investigators who were working on the case were soon at a standstill. There were no developments and little evidence of any sort, so police turned their attention to tracking the ransom payments. A pamphlet was prepared with the serial numbers on the ransom bills, and 250,000 copies were distributed to businesses, mainly in New York City. A few of the ransom bills appeared in scattered locations, some as far away as Chicago and Minneapolis, but those spending the bills were never found.

By a presidential order, all gold certificates were to be exchanged for other bills by May 1, 1933. A few days before the deadline, a man brought $2,980 to a Manhattan bank for exchange; it was later realized the bills were from the ransom. He had given his name as J.J. Faulkner of 537 West 149th Street. No one named Faulkner lived at that address, and a Jane Faulkner who had lived there 20 years earlier denied involvement.

==Arrest of Hauptmann==

During a thirty-month period, a number of the ransom bills were spent throughout New York City. Detectives realized that many of the bills were being spent along the route of the Lexington Avenue subway, which connected the Bronx with the east side of Manhattan, including the German-Austrian neighborhood of Yorkville.

On September 18, 1934, a Manhattan bank teller noticed a gold certificate from the ransom; a New York license plate number (4U-13-41-N.Y) penciled in the bill&#x27;s margin allowed it to be traced to a nearby gas station. The station manager had written down the license number because his customer was acting &quot;suspicious&quot; and was &quot;possibly a counterfeiter&quot;. The license plate belonged to a sedan owned by Richard Hauptmann of 1279 East 222nd Street in the Bronx, an immigrant with a criminal record in Germany. When Hauptmann was arrested, he was carrying a single 20-dollar gold certificate and over $14,000 of the ransom money was found in his garage.

Hauptmann was arrested, interrogated, and beaten at least once throughout the following day and night. Hauptmann stated that the money and other items had been left with him by his friend and former business partner Isidor Fisch. Fisch had died on March 29, 1934, shortly after returning to Germany. Hauptmann stated he learned only after Fisch&#x27;s death that the shoebox that was left with him contained a considerable sum of money. He kept the money because he claimed that it was owed to him from a business deal that he and Fisch had made. Hauptmann consistently denied any connection to the crime or knowledge that the money in his house was from the ransom.

When the police searched Hauptmann&#x27;s home, they found a considerable amount of additional evidence that linked him to the crime. One item was a notebook that contained a sketch of the construction of a ladder similar to that which was found at the Lindbergh home in March 1932. John Condon&#x27;s telephone number, along with his address, were discovered written on a closet wall in the house. A key piece of evidence, a section of wood, was discovered in the attic of the home. After being examined by an expert, it was determined to be an exact match to the wood used in the construction of the ladder found at the scene of the crime.

Hauptmann was indicted in the Bronx on September 24, 1934, for extorting the $50,000 ransom from Charles Lindbergh. Two weeks later, on October 8, Hauptmann was indicted in New Jersey for the murder of Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. Two days later, he was surrendered to New Jersey authorities by New York Governor Herbert H. Lehman to face charges directly related to the kidnapping and murder of the child. Hauptmann was moved to the Hunterdon County Jail in Flemington, New Jersey, on October 19.

==Trial and execution==
===Trial===

Hauptmann was charged with capital murder. The trial was held at the Hunterdon County Courthouse in Flemington, New Jersey, and was soon dubbed the &quot;Trial of the Century&quot;. Reporters swarmed the town, and every hotel room was booked. Judge Thomas Whitaker Trenchard presided over the trial.

In exchange for rights to publish Hauptmann&#x27;s story in their newspaper, Edward J. Reilly was hired by the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; to serve as Hauptmann&#x27;s attorney. David T. Wilentz, Attorney General of New Jersey, led the prosecution.

Evidence against Hauptmann included $20,000 of the ransom money found in his garage and testimony alleging that his handwriting and spelling were similar to those of the ransom notes. Eight handwriting experts, including Albert S. Osborn, pointed out similarities between the ransom notes and Hauptmann&#x27;s writing specimens. The defense called an expert to rebut this evidence, while two others declined to testify; the latter two demanded $500 before looking at the notes and were dismissed when Lloyd Fisher, a member of Hauptmann&#x27;s legal team, declined. Other experts retained by the defense were never called to testify.

On the basis of the work of Arthur Koehler at the Forest Products Laboratory, the State introduced photographs demonstrating that part of the wood from the ladder matched a plank from the floor of Hauptmann&#x27;s attic: the type of wood, the direction of tree growth, the milling pattern, the inside and outside surface of the wood, and the grain on both sides were identical, and four oddly placed nail holes lined up with nail holes in joists in Hauptmann&#x27;s attic. Condon&#x27;s address and telephone number were written in pencil on a closet door in Hauptmann&#x27;s home, and Hauptmann told police that he had written Condon&#x27;s address:

A sketch that Wilentz suggested represented a ladder was found in one of Hauptmann&#x27;s notebooks. Hauptmann said this picture and other sketches therein were the work of a child.

Despite not having an obvious source of earned income, Hauptmann had bought a $400 radio (approximately ) and sent his wife on a trip to Germany.

Hauptmann was identified as the man to whom the ransom money was delivered. Other witnesses testified that it was Hauptmann who had spent some of the Lindbergh gold certificates; that he had been seen in the area of the estate, in East Amwell, New Jersey, near Hopewell, on the day of the kidnapping; and that he had been absent from work on the day of the ransom payment and had quit his job two days later. Hauptmann never sought another job afterward, yet continued to live comfortably.

When the prosecution rested its case, the defense opened with a lengthy examination of Hauptmann. In his testimony, Hauptmann denied being guilty, insisting that the box of gold certificates had been left in his garage by a friend, Isidor Fisch, who had returned to Germany in December 1933 and died there in March 1934. Hauptmann said that he had one day found a shoe box left behind by Fisch, which Hauptmann had stored on the top shelf of his kitchen broom closet, later discovering the money, which he later found to be almost $40,000 (approximately ). Hauptmann said that, because Fisch had owed him about $7,500 in business funds, Hauptmann had kept the money for himself and had lived on it since January 1934.

The defense called Hauptmann&#x27;s wife, Anna, to corroborate the Fisch story. On cross-examination, she admitted that while she hung her apron every day on a hook higher than the top shelf, she could not remember seeing any shoe box there. Later, rebuttal witnesses testified that Fisch could not have been at the scene of the crime, and that he had no money for medical treatments when he died of tuberculosis. Fisch&#x27;s landlady testified that he could barely afford the $3.50 weekly rent of his room.

In his closing summation, Reilly argued that the evidence against Hauptmann was entirely circumstantial, because no reliable witness had placed Hauptmann at the scene of the crime, nor were his fingerprints found on the ladder, on the ransom notes, or anywhere in the nursery.

===Appeals===
Hauptmann was convicted on February 13, 1935, and immediately sentenced to death. His attorneys appealed to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, which at the time was the state&#x27;s highest court; the appeal was argued on June 29, 1935.

New Jersey Governor Harold G. Hoffman secretly visited Hauptmann in his cell on the evening of October 16, accompanied by a stenographer who spoke German fluently. Hoffman urged members of the Court of Errors and Appeals to visit Hauptmann.

In late January 1936, while declaring that he held no position on the guilt or innocence of Hauptmann, Hoffman cited evidence that the crime was not a &quot;one person&quot; job and directed Schwarzkopf to continue a thorough and impartial investigation in an effort to bring all parties involved to justice.

It became known among the press that on March 27, Hoffman was considering a second reprieve of Hauptmann&#x27;s death sentence and was seeking opinions about whether the governor had the right to issue a second reprieve.

On March 30, 1936, Hauptmann&#x27;s second and final appeal asking for clemency from the New Jersey Board of Pardons was denied. Hoffman later announced that this decision would be the final legal action in the case, and that he would not grant another reprieve. Nonetheless, there was a postponement, when the Mercer County grand jury, investigating the confession and arrest of Trenton attorney, Paul Wendel, requested a delay from Warden Mark Kimberling. This, the final stay, ended when the Mercer County prosecutor informed Kimberling that the grand jury had adjourned after voting to end its investigation without charging Wendel.

===Execution===
Hauptmann turned down a large offer from a Hearst newspaper for a confession and refused a last-minute offer to commute his sentence from the death penalty to life without parole in exchange for a confession. He was executed by the electric chair on April 3, 1936.

After his death, some reporters and independent investigators came up with numerous questions about the way in which the investigation had been run and the fairness of the trial, including witness tampering and planted evidence. Twice in the 1980s, Anna Hauptmann sued the state of New Jersey for the unjust execution of her husband. The suits were dismissed due to prosecutorial immunity and because the statute of limitations had run out. She continued fighting to clear his name until her death, at age 95, in 1994.

==Alternative theories==
A number of books have asserted Hauptmann&#x27;s innocence, generally highlighting inadequate police work at the crime scene, Lindbergh&#x27;s interference in the investigation, the ineffectiveness of Hauptmann&#x27;s counsel, and weaknesses in the witnesses and physical evidence. Ludovic Kennedy, in particular, questioned much of the evidence, such as the origin of the ladder and the testimony of many of the witnesses.

According to author Lloyd Gardner, a fingerprint expert, Erastus Mead Hudson, applied the then-rare silver nitrate fingerprint process to the ladder and did not find Hauptmann&#x27;s fingerprints, even in places that the maker of the ladder must have touched. According to Gardner, officials refused to consider this expert&#x27;s findings, and the ladder was then washed of all fingerprints.

Jim Fisher, a former FBI agent and professor at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, has written two books, &quot;The Lindbergh Case&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Ghosts of Hopewell&quot; (1999), addressing what he calls a &quot;revision movement&quot; regarding the case. He summarizes:

Another book, &quot;Hauptmann&#x27;s Ladder: A Step-by-Step Analysis of the Lindbergh Kidnapping&quot; by Richard T. Cahill Jr., concludes that Hauptmann was guilty but questions whether he should have been executed.

According to John Reisinger in &quot;Master Detective&quot;, New Jersey detective Ellis Parker conducted an independent investigation in 1936 and obtained a signed confession from former Trenton attorney Paul Wendel, creating a sensation and resulting in a temporary stay of execution for Hauptmann. The case against Wendel collapsed, however, when he insisted his confession had been coerced.

Robert Zorn&#x27;s 2012 book &quot;Cemetery John&quot; proposes that Hauptmann was part of a conspiracy with two other German-born men, John and Walter Knoll. Zorn&#x27;s father, economist Eugene Zorn, believed that as a teenager he had witnessed the conspiracy being discussed.

<doc id="319325" wikidata="Q231135" url="?curid=319325" title="Annette O'Toole">
<text>Annette O&#x27;Toole (born Annette Toole; April 1, 1952) is an American actress, singer, and songwriter. She is known for portraying Lisa Bridges in the television series &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, adult Beverly Marsh in the 1990 television mini-series adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s epic horror novel &quot;It&quot;, Lana Lang in &quot;Superman III&quot;, Kathy in the romantic-comedy film &quot;Cross My Heart,&quot; and Martha Kent (the adoptive mother of Clark Kent) on the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Toole was born in Houston, the daughter of Dorothy Geraldine (née Niland) and William West Toole Jr. Her mother taught dance, which O&#x27;Toole herself began learning at the age of three. She started taking acting lessons after her family moved to Los Angeles when she was 13.

==Career==
===Film and television===
O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s first television appearance was in 1967 on &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;, followed over the next few years with guest appearances in shows such as &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, and &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;.

Her first major film role was as a jaded beauty pageant contestant in the 1975 satire &quot;&quot;Smile&quot;&quot;; she got the role after doing an impression of a &quot;dead cockroach&quot; at the audition. She also appeared as the tutor and girlfriend of Robby Benson&#x27;s character in the college basketball story &quot;&quot;One on One&quot;&quot; in 1977. She co-starred opposite Gary Busey in the 1980 film &quot;Foolin&#x27; Around&quot;. In 1981, she starred in the HBO onstage production of &quot;Vanities&quot;, as well as in the TV movie &quot;Stand By Your Man&quot;, which detailed the life of country music legend Tammy Wynette. Later on in 1982, she appeared briefly as Nick Nolte&#x27;s girlfriend in &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; That same year, she played Alice Perrin in &quot;Cat People&quot;, and then in 1983 she played Lana Lang (love interest to Clark Kent/Superman), and single mother of Ricky in &quot;Superman III&quot;.

In 1985, she co-starred with Barry Manilow in the CBS television movie &quot;Copacabana&quot; playing Lola La Mar to Manilow&#x27;s Tony Starr. Also in 1985, she had a starring role as Ms. Edmunds in the original &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot;, and appeared in the TV adaptation of &quot;Strong Medicine&quot; the following year. In 1987&#x27;s &quot;Cross My Heart&quot;, a romantic comedy, O&#x27;Toole had a leading role opposite Martin Short.

In 1990, O&#x27;Toole had roles in two ABC television mini-series. She played the adult Beverly Marsh in the television mini-series adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s epic horror novel &quot;It.&quot; She also portrayed Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy in &quot;The Kennedys of Massachusetts&quot;, a role that earned her an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress. She next starred in the 1992 NBC mini-series &quot;Jewels&quot;, based on the Danielle Steel novel of the same name.

In 1993, O&#x27;Toole starred in &quot;Desperate Justice&quot; as Ellen Wells. In 1995, she starred as Cheryl Keeton in the 1995 Lifetime television film based on Ann Rule&#x27;s true crime novel &quot;Dead by Sunset&quot;. She had a recurring role on the television show &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996) and starred in her own series &quot;The Huntress&quot; (2000) as a female bounty hunter. In 1997 O&#x27;Toole starred in the TV movie &quot;Keeping the Promise&quot;.

In 2001, 18 years after portraying Lana Lang in &quot;Superman III&quot;, O&#x27;Toole returned to the &quot;Superman&quot; mythos in the role of Martha Kent, Superman&#x27;s adoptive mother, in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. She remained part of the show&#x27;s main cast, though at times in the background, until the end of its sixth season. She made guest apperances in the final two seasons, reprising her role, while also portraying The Red Queen.

In 2010, O&#x27;Toole played the role of Veronica, a middle-aged woman with a severe case of Alzheimer&#x27;s, in the television series &quot;Lie to Me&quot;. In 2013 she appeared in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as a school teacher who finds out, after surgery, that she will die from cancer.

O&#x27;Toole portrayed Susan Emerson in six episodes of the first two seasons of &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;. In 2016, O&#x27;Toole returned to the Stephen King realm as boarding house owner Edna Price in &quot;The Kill Floor&quot; episode of the King miniseries &quot;11.22.63.&quot; She and former &quot;Smallville&quot; co-star John Glover reunited for the 2016 horror film &quot;We Go On&quot;.

In 2019, O&#x27;Toole filled the role of Hope McCrea in the Netflix series &quot;Virgin River.&quot; She still currently plays the role, with season six being released in December 2024.

===Musical career===
O&#x27;Toole can date the beginning of her songwriting career to events during a car ride after the September 11 attacks; as her husband Michael McKean describes it, &quot;On September 11, 2001, Annette found herself without an airline to carry her back down to Los Angeles from Vancouver, where she films &quot;Smallville&quot;. So she drove a rental car down. The two of us drove it back up together, and on the long drive up there, somewhere between Portland and Seattle, she told me she had a tune in her head.&quot; The &quot;tune in her head&quot; became &quot;Potato&#x27;s in the Paddy Wagon&quot;, one of three songs the couple wrote for &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;, including the Oscar-nominated song &quot;A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow&quot;.

O&#x27;Toole sang &quot;What Could Be Better?&quot;—a song she and her husband co-wrote – for the 2004 Disney children&#x27;s album &quot;A World of Happiness&quot;.

In 2005, the couple did a cabaret act for &quot;Feinstein&#x27;s at the Regency&quot; in New York City.

In 2007, O&#x27;Toole appeared as a backing singer for her husband&#x27;s fictional band Spinal Tap at the London leg of the Live Earth concerts.

<text>Homer Lea (November 17, 1876 – November 1, 1912) was an American author of works on geopolitics who became a military advisor and general in the army of Sun Yat-sen.

==Early life==
Born in Denver, Colorado, to Alfred E. (b.1845) and Hersa A. (1846–1879; née Coberly) Lea, his father served with the 3rd Colorado Cavalry during the Civil War. His mother died before his third birthday on May 13, 1879. Alfred is listed in the Jackson County, Missouri 1850 census, Washington Township, with the entire family being born in Tennessee. His mother&#x27;s previous husband was Silas Soule, who was a Captain in the Union Army that refused to participate in the Sand Creek Massacre.

Homer was born healthy, but after suffering a drop to a hearthstone as a baby, he became a hunchback, standing only with a weight under . He attended East High School (Denver) and Los Angeles High School and accompanied friends on camping trips in the San Bernardino Mountains, in spite of his physical hindrances. Lea aspired to be a great soldier and somehow managed to get an appointment to West Point, though he was soon dismissed for health reasons. He was later admitted to Stanford University, where in addition to military history and politics, he became enamored with China and Chinese culture.

==China==
At 23, with the Boxer Rebellion underway in China, Lea travelled to the Far East and offered his services to Kang Youwei, a former prime minister of China who was attempting to restore power to the confined Guangxu Emperor. Lea convinced Kang to make him a lieutenant general and give him command of a small volunteer force. Lea&#x27;s first command was not very successful as Kang&#x27;s power and support was rapidly destroyed, but he did make it to Beijing in time to ride through the city with the international force that liberated it from the Boxers. Lea offered pursuit of the retreating Imperial Army, but his rag-tag soldiers were no match for the Imperial forces and he was repulsed. Without any support after Kang&#x27;s fall, Lea fled to Hong Kong and then Japan, where he met Sun Yat-sen.

Sun was intrigued by the diminutive foreigner and saw his natural flair and western background could be useful in building support for the republican movement. He therefore dispatched Lea along with Prince Ch&#x27;i-ch&#x27;ao to the United States to raise funds. Lea returned to China in 1904 at the head of the Second Army Division, but this military campaign was unsuccessful and he was forced to return to the United States for health reasons.

==Works==
Once in the U.S., Homer Lea was instrumental in training the Chinese Imperial Reform Army, using American soldiers as instructors. Lea was also an author of two works on geopolitics: &quot;The Valor of Ignorance&quot; predicted the rise of Japanese militarist aggression and a Japanese empire in the Pacific, while &quot;The Day of the Saxon&quot;, commissioned by British Field Marshal Lord Frederick Roberts, predicted the rise of a greater German Reich based on national supremacy and ethnic purity. Neither of these books sold particularly well in America, but &quot;The Valor of Ignorance&quot; sold 84,000 copies in Japan and impressed both General Adna Chaffee and General Douglas MacArthur, who tried unsuccessfully to make it compulsory reading at West Point. Japanese officers studied &quot;The Valor of Ignorance&quot; avidly and put its deadly lessons into practice in 1941. &quot;The Day of the Saxon&quot; sold only 7,000 copies; but one was acquired by German general Karl Haushofer. The books both made accurate predictions about future events, but entrenched isolationists in America were not threatened by an obscure military theorist who didn&#x27;t have much influence. His books remain little known today, though they were cult classics in the first half of the twentieth century. Some say his theories were not particularly revolutionary; other geopoliticians could also see the same forces converging, but the public did not want to hear about it and U.S. Military officers had actively derided it. Lea also planned to write a third book called &quot;The Swarming of the Slav&quot; predicting a Russian move to dominate Europe, but he died before he could complete it.

==Late life and death==

When Sun Yat-sen made China a republic in 1911–1912 he made Lea, whose already frail health had been further tried by several bouts of illness, a full general and his chief of staff. A stroke several months later, however, forced Lea to give up these positions and retire to the United States, where he died at age 35 in Ocean Park, California.

In April 1969, his ashes and those of his wife Ethel (née Bryant) were re-interred at Yangmingshan No. 1 Public Cemetery, in the Beitou District of Taipei, Taiwan.

<text>A guidance system is a virtual or physical device, or a group of devices implementing a controlling the movement of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or any other moving object. Guidance is the process of calculating the changes in position, velocity, altitude, and/or rotation rates of a moving object required to follow a certain trajectory and/or altitude profile based on information about the object&#x27;s state of motion.

A guidance system is usually part of a Guidance, navigation and control system, whereas navigation refers to the systems necessary to calculate the current position and orientation based on sensor data like those from compasses, GPS receivers, Loran-C, star trackers, inertial measurement units, altimeters, etc. The output of the navigation system, the navigation solution, is an input for the guidance system, among others like the environmental conditions (wind, water, temperature, etc.) and the vehicle&#x27;s characteristics (i.e. mass, control system availability, control systems correlation to vector change, etc.). In general, the guidance system computes the instructions for the control system, which comprises the object&#x27;s actuators (e.g., thrusters, reaction wheels, body flaps, etc.), which are able to manipulate the path and orientation of the object without direct or continuous human control.

One of the earliest examples of a true guidance system is that used in the German V-1 during World War II. The navigation system consisted of a simple gyroscope, an airspeed sensor, and an altimeter. The guidance instructions were target altitude, target velocity, cruise time, and engine cut off time.

A guidance system has three major sub-sections: Inputs, Processing, and Outputs. The input section includes sensors, course data, radio and satellite links, and other information sources. The processing section, composed of one or more CPUs, integrates this data and determines what actions, if any, are necessary to maintain or achieve a proper heading. This is then fed to the outputs which can directly affect the system&#x27;s course. The outputs may control speed by interacting with devices such as turbines, and fuel pumps, or they may more directly alter course by actuating ailerons, rudders, or other devices.

==History==
Inertial guidance systems were originally developed for rockets. American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard experimented with rudimentary gyroscopic systems. Dr. Goddard&#x27;s systems were of great interest to contemporary German pioneers including Wernher von Braun. The systems entered more widespread use with the advent of spacecraft, guided missiles, and commercial airliners.

US guidance history centers around 2 distinct communities. One driven out of Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the other from the German scientists that developed the early V2 rocket guidance and MIT. The GN&amp;C system for V2 provided many innovations and was the most sophisticated military weapon in 1942 using self-contained closed loop guidance. Early V2s leveraged 2 gyroscopes and lateral accelerometer with a simple analog computer to adjust the azimuth for the rocket in flight. Analog computer signals were used to drive 4 external rudders on the tail fins for flight control. Von Braun engineered the surrender of 500 of his top rocket scientists, along with plans and test vehicles, to the Americans. They arrived in Fort Bliss, Texas in 1945 and were subsequently moved to Huntsville, Alabama, in 1950 (aka Redstone arsenal). Von Braun&#x27;s passion was interplanetary space flight. However his tremendous leadership skills and experience with the V-2 program made him invaluable to the US military. In 1955 the Redstone team was selected to put America&#x27;s first satellite into orbit putting this group at the center of both military and commercial space.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory traces its history from the 1930s, when Caltech professor Theodore von Karman conducted pioneering work in rocket propulsion. Funded by Army Ordnance in 1942, JPL&#x27;s early efforts would eventually involve technologies beyond those of aerodynamics and propellant chemistry. The result of the Army Ordnance effort was JPL&#x27;s answer to the German V-2 missile, named MGM-5 Corporal, first launched in May 1947. On December 3, 1958, two months after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by Congress, JPL was transferred from Army jurisdiction to that of this new civilian space agency. This shift was due to the creation of a military focused group derived from the German V2 team. Hence, beginning in 1958, NASA JPL and the Caltech crew became focused primarily on unmanned flight and shifted away from military applications with a few exceptions. The community surrounding JPL drove tremendous innovation in telecommunication, interplanetary exploration and earth monitoring (among other areas).

In the early 1950s, the US government wanted to insulate itself against over dependency on the German team for military applications. Among the areas that were domestically &quot;developed&quot; was missile guidance. In the early 1950s the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (later to become the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.) was chosen by the Air Force Western Development Division to provide a self-contained guidance system backup to Convair in San Diego for the new Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile. The technical monitor for the MIT task was a young engineer named Jim Fletcher who later served as the NASA Administrator. The Atlas guidance system was to be a combination of an on-board autonomous system, and a ground-based tracking and command system. This was the beginning of a philosophic controversy, which, in some areas, remains unresolved. The self-contained system finally prevailed in ballistic missile applications for obvious reasons. In space exploration, a mixture of the two remains.

In the summer of 1952, Dr. Richard Battin and Dr. J. Halcombe (&quot;Hal&quot;) Laning Jr., researched computational based solutions to guidance as computing began to step out of the analog approach. As computers of that time were very slow (and missiles very fast) it was extremely important to develop programs that were very efficient. Dr. J. Halcombe Laning, with the help of Phil Hankins and Charlie Werner, initiated work on MAC, an algebraic programming language for the IBM 650, which was completed by early spring of 1958. MAC became the work-horse of the MIT lab. MAC is an extremely readable language having a three-line format, vector-matrix notations and mnemonic and indexed subscripts. Today&#x27;s Space Shuttle (STS) language called HAL, (developed by Intermetrics, Inc.) is a direct offshoot of MAC. Since the principal architect of HAL was Jim Miller, who co-authored with Hal Laning a report on the MAC system, it is a reasonable speculation that the space shuttle language is named for Jim&#x27;s old mentor, and not, as some have suggested, for the electronic superstar of the Arthur Clarke movie &quot;2001-A Space Odyssey.&quot; (Richard Battin, AIAA 82–4075, April 1982)

Hal Laning and Richard Battin undertook the initial analytical work on the Atlas inertial guidance in 1954. Other key figures at Convair were Charlie Bossart, the Chief Engineer, and Walter Schweidetzky, head of the guidance group. Walter had worked with Wernher von Braun at Peenemuende during World War II.

The initial &quot;Delta&quot; guidance system assessed the difference in position from a reference trajectory. A velocity to be gained (VGO) calculation is made to correct the current trajectory with the objective of driving VGO to Zero. The mathematics of this approach were fundamentally valid, but dropped because of the challenges in accurate inertial navigation (e.g. IMU Accuracy) and analog computing power. The challenges faced by the &quot;Delta&quot; efforts were overcome by the &quot;Q system&quot; of guidance. The &quot;Q&quot; system&#x27;s revolution was to bind the challenges of missile guidance (and associated equations of motion) in the matrix Q. The Q matrix represents the partial derivatives of the velocity with respect to the position vector. A key feature of this approach allowed for the components of the vector cross product (v, xdv,/dt) to be used as the basic autopilot rate signals-a technique that became known as &quot;cross-product steering.&quot; The Q-system was presented at the first Technical Symposium on Ballistic Missiles held at the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation in Los Angeles on June 21 and 22, 1956. The &quot;Q System&quot; was classified information through the 1960s. Derivations of this guidance are used for today&#x27;s military missiles. The CSDL team remains a leader in the military guidance and is involved in projects for most divisions of the US military.

On August 10 of 1961 NASA awarded MIT a contract for preliminary design study of a guidance and navigation system for Apollo program. (see Apollo on-board guidance, navigation, and control system, Dave Hoag, International Space Hall of Fame Dedication Conference in Alamogordo, N.M., October 1976 ). Today&#x27;s space shuttle guidance is named PEG4 (Powered Explicit Guidance). It takes into account both the Q system and the predictor-corrector attributes of the original &quot;Delta&quot; System (PEG Guidance). Although many updates to the shuttles navigation system have taken place over the last 30 years (ex. GPS in the OI-22 build), the guidance core of today&#x27;s Shuttle GN&amp;C system has evolved little. Within a manned system, there is a human interface needed for the guidance system. As Astronauts are the customer for the system, many new teams are formed that touch GN&amp;C as it is a primary interface to &quot;fly&quot; the vehicle. For the Apollo and STS (Shuttle system) CSDL &quot;designed&quot; the guidance, McDonnell Douglas wrote the requirements and IBM programmed the requirements.

Much system complexity within manned systems is driven by &quot;redundancy management&quot; and the support of multiple &quot;abort&quot; scenarios that provide for crew safety. Manned US Lunar and Interplanetary guidance systems leverage many of the same guidance innovations (described above) developed in the 1950s. So while the core mathematical construct of guidance has remained fairly constant, the facilities surrounding GN&amp;C continue to evolve to support new vehicles, new missions and new hardware. The center of excellence for the manned guidance remains at MIT (CSDL) as well as the former McDonnell Douglas Space Systems (in Houston).

<text>Microfilaments, also called actin filaments, are protein filaments in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells that form part of the cytoskeleton. They are primarily composed of polymers of actin, but are modified by and interact with numerous other proteins in the cell. Microfilaments are usually about 7 nm in diameter and made up of two strands of actin. Microfilament functions include cytokinesis, amoeboid movement, cell motility, changes in cell shape, endocytosis and exocytosis, cell contractility, and mechanical stability. Microfilaments are flexible and relatively strong, resisting buckling by multi-piconewton compressive forces and filament fracture by nanonewton tensile forces. In inducing cell motility, one end of the actin filament elongates while the other end contracts, presumably by myosin II molecular motors. Additionally, they function as part of actomyosin-driven contractile molecular motors, wherein the thin filaments serve as tensile platforms for myosin&#x27;s ATP-dependent pulling action in muscle contraction and pseudopod advancement. Microfilaments have a tough, flexible framework which helps the cell in movement.

Actin was first discovered in rabbit skeletal muscle in the mid 1940s by F.B. Straub. Almost 20 years later, H.E. Huxley demonstrated that actin is essential for muscle constriction. The mechanism in which actin creates long filaments was first described in the mid 1980s. Later studies showed that actin has an important role in cell shape, motility, and cytokinesis.

==Organization==
Actin filaments are assembled in two general types of structures: bundles and networks. Bundles can be composed of polar filament arrays, in which all barbed ends point to the same end of the bundle, or non-polar arrays, where the barbed ends point towards both ends. A class of actin-binding proteins, called cross-linking proteins, dictate the formation of these structures. Cross-linking proteins determine filament orientation and spacing in the bundles and networks. These structures are regulated by many other classes of actin-binding proteins, including motor proteins, branching proteins, severing proteins, polymerization promoters, and capping proteins.

==&quot;In vitro&quot; self-assembly==
Measuring approximately 6 nm in diameter, microfilaments are the thinnest fibers of the cytoskeleton. They are polymers of actin subunits (globular actin, or G-actin), which as part of the fiber are referred to as filamentous actin, or F-actin. Each microfilament is made up of two helical, interlaced strands of subunits. Much like microtubules, actin filaments are polarized. Electron micrographs have provided evidence of their fast-growing barbed-ends and their slow-growing pointed-end. This polarity has been determined by the pattern created by the binding of myosin S1 fragments: they themselves are subunits of the larger myosin II protein complex. The pointed end is commonly referred to as the minus (−) end and the barbed end is referred to as the plus (+) end.

&quot;In vitro&quot; actin polymerization, or nucleation, starts with the self-association of three G-actin monomers to form a trimer. ATP-bound actin then itself binds the barbed end, and the ATP is subsequently hydrolyzed. ATP hydrolysis occurs with a half time of about 2 seconds, while the half time for the dissociation of the inorganic phosphate is about 6 minutes. This autocatalyzed event reduces the binding strength between neighboring subunits, and thus generally destabilizes the filament. &quot;In vivo&quot; actin polymerization is catalyzed by a class of filament end-tracking molecular motors known as actoclampins. Recent evidence suggests that the rate of ATP hydrolysis and the rate of monomer incorporation are strongly coupled.

Subsequently, ADP-actin dissociates slowly from the pointed end, a process significantly accelerated by the actin-binding protein, cofilin. ADP bound cofilin severs ADP-rich regions nearest the (−)-ends. Upon release, the free actin monomer slowly dissociates from ADP, which in turn rapidly binds to the free ATP diffusing in the cytosol, thereby forming the ATP-actin monomeric units needed for further barbed-end filament elongation. This rapid turnover is important for the cell&#x27;s movement. End-capping proteins such as CapZ prevent the addition or loss of monomers at the filament end where actin turnover is unfavorable, such as in the muscle apparatus.

Actin polymerization together with capping proteins were recently used to control the 3-dimensional growth of protein filament so as to perform 3D topologies useful in technology and the making of electrical interconnect. Electrical conductivity is obtained by metallisation of the protein 3D structure.

==Mechanism of force generation==
As a result of ATP hydrolysis, filaments elongate approximately 10 times faster at their barbed ends than their pointed ends. At steady-state, the polymerization rate at the barbed end matches the depolymerization rate at the pointed end, and microfilaments are said to be treadmilling. Treadmilling results in elongation in the barbed end and shortening in the pointed-end, so that the filament in total moves. Since both processes are energetically favorable, this means force is generated, the energy ultimately coming from ATP.

==Actin in cells==
Intracellular actin cytoskeletal assembly and disassembly are tightly regulated by cell signaling mechanisms. Many signal transduction systems use the actin cytoskeleton as a scaffold, holding them at or near the inner face of the peripheral membrane. This subcellular location allows immediate responsiveness to transmembrane receptor action and the resulting cascade of signal-processing enzymes.

Because actin monomers must be recycled to sustain high rates of actin-based motility during chemotaxis, cell signalling is believed to activate cofilin, the actin-filament depolymerizing protein which binds to ADP-rich actin subunits nearest the filament&#x27;s pointed-end and promotes filament fragmentation, with concomitant depolymerization in order to liberate actin monomers. In most animal cells, monomeric actin is bound to profilin and thymosin beta-4, both of which preferentially bind with one-to-one stoichiometry to ATP-containing monomers. Although thymosin beta-4 is strictly a monomer-sequestering protein, the behavior of profilin is far more complex. Profilin enhances the ability of monomers to assemble by stimulating the exchange of actin-bound ADP for solution-phase ATP to yield actin-ATP and ADP. Profilin is transferred to the leading edge by virtue of its PIP2 binding site, and it employs its poly-L-proline binding site to dock onto end-tracking proteins. Once bound, profilin-actin-ATP is loaded into the monomer-insertion site of actoclampin motors.

Another important component in filament formation is the Arp2/3 complex, which binds to the side of an already existing filament (or &quot;mother filament&quot;), where it nucleates the formation of a new daughter filament at a 70-degree angle relative to the mother filament, effecting a fan-like branched filament network.

Specialized unique actin cytoskeletal structures are found adjacent to the plasma membrane. Four remarkable examples include red blood cells, human embryonic kidney cells, neurons, and sperm cells. In red blood cells, a spectrin-actin hexagonal lattice is formed by interconnected short actin filaments. In human embryonic kidney cells, the cortical actin forms a scale-free fractal structure. First found in neuronal axons, actin forms periodic rings that are stabilized by spectrin and adducin and this ring structure was then found by He et al 2016 to occur in almost every neuronal type and glial cells, across seemingly every animal taxon including &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, &quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;Gallus gallus&quot; and &quot;Mus musculus&quot;. And in mammalian sperm, actin forms a helical structure in the midpiece, i.e., the first segment of the flagellum.

==Associated proteins==
In non-muscle cells, actin filaments are formed proximal to membrane surfaces. Their formation and turnover are regulated by many proteins, including:
* Filament end-tracking protein (e.g., formins, VASP, N-WASP)
* Filament-nucleator known as the Actin-Related Protein-2/3 (or Arp2/3) complex
* Filament cross-linkers (e.g., α-actinin, fascin, and fimbrin)
* Actin monomer-binding proteins profilin and thymosin β4
* Filament barbed-end cappers such as Capping Protein and CapG, &quot;etc&quot;.
* Filament-severing proteins like gelsolin.
* Actin depolymerizing proteins such as ADF/cofilin.

The actin filament network in non-muscle cells is highly dynamic. The actin filament network is arranged with the barbed-end of each filament attached to the cell&#x27;s peripheral membrane by means of clamped-filament elongation motors, the above-mentioned &quot;actoclampins&quot;, formed from a filament barbed-end and a clamping protein (formins, VASP, Mena, WASP, and N-WASP). The primary substrate for these elongation motors is profilin-actin-ATP complex which is directly transferred to elongating filament ends. The pointed-end of each filament is oriented toward the cell&#x27;s interior. In the case of lamellipodial growth, the Arp2/3 complex generates a branched network, and in filopodia a parallel array of filaments is formed.

Myosin motors are intracellular ATP-dependent enzymes that bind to and move along actin filaments. Various classes of myosin motors have very different behaviors, including exerting tension in the cell and transporting cargo vesicles.

==A proposed model – &quot;actoclampins&quot; track filament ends==
One proposed model suggests the existence of actin filament barbed-end-tracking molecular motors termed &quot;actoclampin&quot;. The proposed actoclampins generate the propulsive forces needed for actin-based motility of lamellipodia, filopodia, invadipodia, dendritic spines, intracellular vesicles, and motile processes in endocytosis, exocytosis, podosome formation, and phagocytosis. Actoclampin motors also propel such intracellular pathogens as &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot;, &quot;Vaccinia&quot; and &quot;Rickettsia&quot;. When assembled under suitable conditions, these end-tracking molecular motors can also propel biomimetic particles.

The term actoclampin is derived from &quot;acto&quot;- to indicate the involvement of an actin filament, as in actomyosin, and &quot;clamp&quot; to indicate a clasping device used for strengthening flexible/moving objects and for securely fastening two or more components, followed by the suffix -&quot;in&quot; to indicate its protein origin. An actin filament end-tracking protein may thus be termed a clampin.

Dickinson and Purich recognized that prompt ATP hydrolysis could explain the forces achieved during actin-based motility. They proposed a simple mechanoenzymatic sequence known as the Lock, Load &amp; Fire Model, in which an end-tracking protein remains tightly bound (&quot;locked&quot; or clamped) onto the end of one sub-filament of the double-stranded actin filament. After binding to Glycyl-Prolyl-Prolyl-Prolyl-Prolyl-Prolyl-registers on tracker proteins, Profilin-ATP-actin is delivered (&quot;loaded&quot;) to the unclamped end of the other sub-filament, whereupon ATP within the already clamped terminal subunit of the other subfragment is hydrolyzed (&quot;fired&quot;), providing the energy needed to release that arm of the end-tracker, which then can bind another Profilin-ATP-actin to begin a new monomer-addition round.

===Steps involved===
The following steps describe one force-generating cycle of an actoclampin molecular motor:
# The polymerization cofactor profilin and the ATP·actin combine to form a profilin-ATP-actin complex that then binds to the end-tracking unit
# The cofactor and monomer are transferred to the barbed-end of an actin already clamped filament
# The tracking unit and cofactor dissociate from the adjacent protofilament, in a step that can be facilitated by ATP hydrolysis energy to modulate the affinity of the cofactor and/or the tracking unit for the filament; and this mechanoenzymatic cycle is then repeated, starting this time on the other sub-filament growth site.

When operating with the benefit of ATP hydrolysis, AC motors generate per-filament forces of 8–9 pN, which is far greater than the per-filament limit of 1–2 pN for motors operating without ATP hydrolysis. The term actoclampin is generic and applies to all actin filament end-tracking molecular motors, irrespective of whether they are driven actively by an ATP-activated mechanism or passively.

Some actoclampins (e.g., those involving Ena/VASP proteins, WASP, and N-WASP) apparently require Arp2/3-mediated filament initiation to form the actin polymerization nucleus that is then &quot;loaded&quot; onto the end-tracker before processive motility can commence. To generate a new filament, Arp2/3 requires a &quot;mother&quot; filament, monomeric ATP-actin, and an activating domain from Listeria ActA or the VCA region of N-WASP. The Arp2/3 complex binds to the side of the mother filament, forming a Y-shaped branch having a 70-degree angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the mother filament. Then upon activation by ActA or VCA, the Arp complex is believed to undergo a major conformational change, bringing its two actin-related protein subunits near enough to each other to generate a new filament gate. Whether ATP hydrolysis may be required for nucleation and/or Y-branch release is a matter under active investigation.

<text>The following list of Canadians by net worth includes the wealthiest Canadian individuals and families as determined by the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; and &quot;The World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot;. In addition to Bloomberg and &quot;Forbes&quot;, some other organizations and publications also measure the wealth of high net-worth individuals and families.

==List of Canadians by net worth==
Several publications have produced listings of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people by net worth, including Bloomberg and &quot;Forbes&quot;. However, there are differences between these listings, with the number of billionaires that exist, as well as their estimated net worth.

According to &quot;Canadian Business&quot;, in November 2017 there were at least 100 Canadian billionaires when using the Canadian dollar to evaluate net worth. This number differs from &quot;The World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot;, and the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;, as they both use the United States dollar to evaluate net worth. Publications may also provide different estimates for an individual&#x27;s net worth, leading to disagreement between the publications.

Several Canadian individuals/families that hold multiple citizenships and have a net worth exceeding C$1 billion may also not be listed as Canadians by the aforementioned publications. For example, Elon Musk, considered to be the richest person in the world in 2021, holds multiple citizenships, including Canadian citizenship; although Bloomberg and &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; listing of billionaires list Musk as an American.

===Bloomberg===

Bloomberg L.P. maintains a daily ranking of the net worth analysis of the world&#x27;s richest people in the world on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is updated &quot;at the close of every trading day in New York&quot;, with the Top 500 provided online each day. The individual results are also published on the profile page of each billionaire. Bloomberg&#x27;s listing only evaluates the net worth of individuals.

The following is a list of the wealthiest individuals, in the world&#x27;s Top 500, with &quot;Canada&quot; listed as their &quot;Country/Region&quot; according to Bloomberg&#x27;s daily listing, the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;, .

===&quot;Forbes&quot;===
&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual listing of billionaires entitled &quot;The World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot; is based on March 10, 2023, &quot;stock prices and exchange rates&quot; in US dollars. They collaborate with FactSet Research Systems, Orbis, PitchBook Data, Real Capital Analytics, Reonomy, S&amp;P Capital IQ, and VesselsValue to collect data. 

&quot;Forbes&quot; will typically list individuals rather than multigenerational families with shared wealth, although their listing will consolidate the wealth belonging to a billionaire&#x27;s spouse and children if that person is the founder of the fortune.

The following is a list of the wealthiest Canadian individuals and families according to the &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; annual &quot;The World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot; listing for 2023.
==Historical==
The richest Canadian to have ever lived is believed to be Herbert Samuel Holt, president of 27 corporations (including Royal Bank of Canada and Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power), and a director of 250 companies worldwide, who had an estimated net worth of billion in 1928 (equivalent to $billion in ).

==Other measurements and rankings of net worth==
===Statistics Canada===
Statistics Canada uses the Survey Financial Security Public Use Microdata File (SFS PUMF) as their principal &quot;family wealth microdata product&quot;.

===Parliamentary Budget Officer===
In September 2019, the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)—an independent, non-partisan office that supports the work of parliamentarians by providing authoritative financial and economic analysis of issues related to public monies—published a two-page cost estimate of the &quot;fiscal revenues of an annual tax on the net wealth of high-net-worth families above $20 million&quot;. The report was one of 200, requested by the political parties in the months leading up to the 2019 federal election. At that time, the main &quot;family wealth microdata product&quot; used by Statistics Canada—the Survey Financial Security Public Use Microdata File (SFS PUMF)—was found to result in &quot;underreporting&quot; and &quot;missing data.&quot; In their 2017 list that ranked Canada&#x27;s top 100 richest people, Toronto-based Rob McEwen of McEwen Mining, ranked 100th with a net worth of C$875 million, while number 1 on the list—the Toronto-based Thomson family of Thomson Reuters—had a net worth of C$39.13 billion. However, the SFS PUMF only reported on the wealth of families with $27 million or less.

In their June 2020 report, the PBO introduced their new &quot;analytic resource&quot; developed to &quot;address the data gap.&quot; Their new modelling approach provides a more reliable estimate of family wealth at the top tail of wealth distribution in Canada. Using publicly available data from &quot;Canadian Business&quot; (CB) magazine and Statistics Canada&#x27;s micro dataset, the OPBO created a new synthetic micro dataset called the High-net-worth Family Database (HFD) that recalibrates the SFS PUMF by adding a &quot;synthetic dataset of families with wealth over $3 million&quot;. Using the more finely grained micro data base, PBO found that the share of the wealth held by top 1% wealthiest Canadian families is 12% higher than the share previously reported using the SFS PUMF. The PBO says that the discrepancy may be due to higher incidences of high net worth families not responding to the SFS. For example, comparing the two surveys based on 2016 data, the SFS PUMF had estimated the wealth held by the top 1% wealthiest Canadians as 13.7%, while the newer calibrated database HFD produced an estimate of 25.6%.

===&quot;Canadian Business&quot;===
&quot;Canadian Business&quot;, has also published an annual ranking of the wealthiest Canadian individuals and families since 1998. The magazine has published complete rankings of the &quot;100 wealthiest individuals and families in Canada&quot;, an &quot;annual guide to the richest people in Canada—how much they&#x27;re worth, how they made their fortunes, and the companies that got them there.&quot; The most recent available list is updated to 2018. Examples of previous years include 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

The Thomson Family increased their wealth by 30% from over C$26 billion in 2013 to over C$30 billion in 2014, reaching over C$39.13 billion by 2017.

<text>Egyptair () is the state-owned flag carrier of Egypt. The airline is headquartered at Cairo International Airport, its main hub, operating scheduled passenger and freight services to 81 destinations in Africa, Europe, Asia, and The Americas. Egyptair is a member of Star Alliance.

==History==

===Early years: Misr Airwork (1932–1949)===
Alan Muntz, chairman of Airwork, visited Egypt in 1931; at that time, he expressed his intention of starting up a new airline in the country. The new enterprise was named &quot;Misr Airwork&quot;, with () being Arabic for &quot;Egypt&quot;. On 31 December 1931, the government granted the new company the exclusivity of air transport operations. A division of Misr Airwork named &quot;Misr Airlines&quot; was established on 7 June 1932, ″to promote the spirit of aviation among Egyptian youth″, becoming the seventh carrier in the world. The headquarters of Misr Airwork, S.A.E. was in Almaza Aerodrome, Heliopolis, Cairo.

The initial investment was £E20,000, with ownership split between the Misr Bank (85%), Airwork (10%), and Egyptian private investors (5%). Operations started in July 1933, initially linking Cairo with Alexandria and Mersa Matruh using de Havilland DH.84 Dragon equipment. By August that year, the frequency on the Cairo–Alexandria service had been boosted to twice-daily. In late 1933, a twice-weekly Cairo–Aswan flight that called at Asyut and Luxor was inaugurated. Via Port Said, a flight from Cairo that served Lydda, Haifa and Gaza was launched in 1934. On 3 August 1935, a test service via Lydda with a final destination in Nicosia began using de Havilland D.H.86 aircraft; the service was terminated on 20 October that year. The Alexandria–Port Said–Cairo–Minia–Assiut route was opened in late 1935. During 1935, the airline carried 6,990 passengers and of freight; for the year, these regular services flew .

The Alexandria–Assiut route, which called at Port Said, Cairo and Minia, and the Cairo–Cyprus–Haifa–Baghdad run were the two operative services the carrier had by 1936. Hadj flights commenced in 1937. Operations to Cyprus resumed in 1938 with a Cairo–Lydda–Haifa–Larnaka service. The carrier operated all-British aircraft in the early years, and by April 1939 the fleet comprised one D.H. Dragon, one D.H. Dragonfly, five D.H. Rapìdes, two D.H.86s and one D.H.86B that worked on the Alexandria–Cairo, Alexandria–Port Said–Cairo–Minia–Assiut, Cairo–Assiut–Luxor–Assuan, Cairo–Lydda–Haifa–Baghdad and Cairo–Port Said–Lydda–Haifa routes. The Egyptian government took over all the routes in September 1939. In 1940, a service to Beirut and Palestine was started. Three Avro 19s were incorporated into the fleet in 1944. Three accidents that took place in late 1945 prompted strikes for a fleet renewal and caused operations to come to a total halt since February 1946; services resumed in May, and by late 1946 the fleet included four Avro Ansons, one Beech AT-11, five Beech C-45s, four de Havilland D.H.89 Dragon Rapides and two North American AT-6 Texan. The carrier benefited from the Allies&#x27; regional aircraft disposal station that sold surplus military aircraft being located in Egypt. Two more Beech C-45s were delivered in 1947, and the Vickers Viking was incorporated in 1948. In May 1949, all the capital and the aircraft park was acquired by the government. After the Egyptian state became the sole shareholder, the company changed its name to &quot;Misrair SAE&quot;.

===Misrair (1949–1957)===
Misrair continued to fly the same routes as its predecessor. In 1951, three Languedocs were acquired; these were intended for deployment on longer routes. The Languedocs replaced the Vikings on flights to Geneva, Khartoum, and Tehran.

On 1 December 1952 Misrair took over the domestic competitor Services Aériens Internationaux d&#x27;Égypte (SAIDE) and thus ended the flight operations of this airline. Only the successful route Cairo-Tunis was carried over to Misrair&#x27;s own route network.

Three Vickers Viscounts were ordered in early 1954. During that year, the carrier transported 64,539 passengers. At March 1955, Misrair&#x27;s fleet comprised one Beechcraft, three Languedocs and seven Vikings; the three Viscounts were still pending delivery. Douglas DC-3s were subsequently purchased and deployed on domestic routes, as well as to neighbouring Arab countries. Delivery of the first two Viscounts occurred in December 1955; they were put into service in March 1956. Eight months later on 1 November 1956, one Viscount (SU-AIC) was written off while parked at Almaza Airport due to an air-raid by the RAF during the Suez crisis The number of passengers transported during 1955 had grown to . In February 1957, Misrair was renamed &quot;United Arab Airlines&quot;. Late that year, two more Viscounts were ordered at a cost of £600,000–800,000, including spares.

===United Arab Airlines (1957–1971)===
Following the formation of the United Arab Republic by Egypt and Syria on 1 February 1958, Misrair was renamed &quot;United Arab Airlines (UAA)&quot; in March that year. A Cairo–Athens–Rome–Zürich service was launched on 7 July; Syrian Airways merged into UAA on 23 December, with the latter absorbing both the routes and the equipment of the Syrian carrier. By March 1960, the airline had 579 employees. At that time, the fleet comprised one Beech Model 18, four DC-3s, six Vikings and six Viscounts. One of the Viscounts crashed into the Mediterranean on 10 April, killing 17 passengers and a crew of three. With registration SU-ALC, the first of three Comet 4Cs was delivered on 9 June. Operations using two of these aircraft started on 16 July the same year. By October 1960, Misrair had Comets deployed on the Cairo–Belgrade–Prague, Cairo–Rome–London, Cairo–Jeddah and Cairo–Khartoum runs, DC-3s on the Cairo–Alexandria–Mersa Matruh, Cairo–Assiut–Luxor, Cairo–Luxor–Aswan and Cairo–Port Said–Alexandria services, and Viscounts were used for the non-stop flights that linked Cairo and Alexandria. An order for two more Comets was placed in November 1960. Syria&#x27;s association with UAA ended in October 1961, when Syrian Arab Airways was established by the Syrian government in Damascus; the route network and fleet that had been taken over by UAA were returned to the new company.

Two more Comets, the and ones, were ordered in early 1961. Three ex-SAS DC-6s were purchased in April 1961. The Cairo–Lagos run was extended to Accra on 12 June and flights to Moscow commenced on 21 June. A contract with Boeing for the purchase of Boeing 707-320B with delivery dates between November 1961 and April 1964 was signed; the deal fell through when the airline could not find financing. On 1 November, a new flight to Karachi and Bombay was launched, and the sixth and seventh Comets were ordered in December; these were delivered in April 1962. Also in 1961, the Cairo–Nicosia run, suspended since the Suez crisis in 1956, was restored, flown with Viscount equipment. Routed via Bangkok and Hong Kong, the Bombay service was extended to Tokyo in May 1962. The three-strong crew of a DC-3 that crashed at Heliopolis on 16 May 1962 died, and 26 more people perished in an accident involving a Comet at Bangkok on 19 July the same year. Two more Comets were acquired in August, entering the fleet in September the same year and during 1963. On 15 February 1963, the route to Baghdad was resumed after a three-year hiatus, but the service was short-lived, as political tensions between Egypt, Iraq and Syria forced the disruption of flights to both this destination and to Damascus; on 1 April, a new service to Rhodesia was inaugurated. On 12 May 1963 a DC-3 crashed near Alexandria, killing 27 passengers and a crew of and on 28 July 1963, a Comet crashed into the ocean near Bombay, killing 62. Short of aircraft to serve Tokyo, the route was terminated. Also, another Comet, SU-ALM, resulted damaged in Benghazi on 12 September, the and final Comet was delivered in 1964. Also that year, three ex-Pan Am DC-6Bs were purchased, and another three were acquired from Northwest Orient; these aircraft were put on service on domestic routes and began replacing the Viscounts. Also aimed at operating domestic services, seven Antonov An-24s were ordered for  million.
By March 1965, seven Comet 4Cs and four Viscounts flew on routes across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, along with a service to Lagos and Accra. On 1 August, a subsidiary airline named &quot;Misrair&quot; started operations. A contract worth  million for three Boeing 707-320Cs was signed with Boeing on 15 June 1966 and also included four additional machines on option. On 1 November, the airline suppressed the stop at Prague on the Cairo–Prague–Moscow service, and in January 1967 UAA started the Cairo–Frankfurt–Copenhagen run. On 22 June 1967, a Comet crashed in Kuwait while landing; there were no fatalities but the aircraft was written off. In August 1968, the airline took delivery of two Ilyushin Il-18s. The first Boeing 707 was handed over by the aircraft manufacturer on 21 October the same year; it was later put into service on the Cairo–London corridor. One of the Il-18s was involved in a deadly crash while attempting to land at Aswan Airport on 20 March 1969. That March, the carrier started services to East Berlin with Il-18 equipment and in June the route to Tokyo via Kuwait, Bombay, Bangkok and Hong Kong was resumed.

On 14 January 1970, a Comet 4C (SU-ANI) crashed on landing at Addis Ababa from Cairo; no one of the 14 people on board resulted seriously injured. On 30 January 1970 the landing gear of an Antonov An-24V, SU-AOK, collapsed on touchdown at Luxor. On 19 February SU-ALE, another Comet, aborted takeoff from Munich Riem Airport at , fell back to the runway, slid until the end of it and hit a fence. Another An-24V, SU-AOC, belly-landed at Cairo on 14 March. At March 1970, UAA had 7,810 employees; the fleet comprised seven An-24Bs, three Boeing 707-366Cs, six Comet 4Cs and three Il-18s. The fourth Boeing 707 was delivered in March 1970. An An-24V (SU-ANZ) was on a training flight and crashed near Cairo, killing the three occupants on 19 July. On 2 January 1971, a Comet (SU-ALC) hit sand dunes on approach to Tripoli, with the loss of lives of the passengers on board and the crew of . On 23 May 1971, the acquisition of two Ilyushin Il-62s was announced, scheduled for delivery in June the same year. June 1971 saw the airline using these aircraft on European routes, supplementing the services operated with the Boeing 707s. The Il-62s were introduced on Asian services on 9 July. The name of the airline was changed to &quot;Egyptair&quot; on 10 October 1971, following the country changing its name to Arab Republic of Egypt.

===Egyptair (1971–onwards)===
Egyptair inherited UAA&#x27;s staff, equipment, assets and liabilities. On 19 March 1972, EgyptAir Flight 763, a Douglas DC-9-32 carrying Yugoslav registration YU-AHR crashed into the Shamsan Mountains, southwest of Aden, killing all 30 occupants. On 16 June, an Ilyushin Il-62 (SU-ARN) was involved in a landing accident with no reported fatalities. In July, Tupolev Tu-154s were ordered for  million, with three of them slated for delivery in July 1973, three in November 1973 and two in March 1974. Before firming the transaction up Egyptair had also considered the Boeing 727, but financing for these US-manufactured aircraft could not be arranged. Under the terms of the contract, light maintenance was to be performed in Egypt, whereas airframe and engine overhauling was to be undertaken in the Soviet Union. In July 1972, the acquisition of four Boeing 707-320Cs valued at  million was announced. At this time, the airline had four Boeing 707s already in operation. The handover of the new aircraft had been arranged for March, May, June and September 1973. On 5 December 1972, one of the four 707s already in the fleet (SU-AOW) crashed near Cairo while on a training flight. The crew of perished in the accident. Reports indicating the airframe had been shot down were denied by the Egyptian government. An Ilyushin Il-18, registration SU-AOY, was involved in a deadly accident near Nicosia on 29 January 1973 when it crashed into mountainous terrain, killing all occupants. Delivery of the four new Boeing 707s took place during the year, with two more 707-320Cs being ordered in September. In October the three Il-62s were returned to Aeroflot because of elevated operational costs and technical issues. Also that month, the first Tu-154 entered the fleet and was used for pilot training. From Moscow, the handover of the Tu-154s was made through London-Heathrow, where these aircraft were fitted with British-made seats.
The outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 had forced the carrier to suspend the Tokyo service; it was resumed on 15 March 1974 via Bombay, Bangkok and Manila. During 1974, the flight to Khartoum was extended to Kinshasa. One of the brand new Tu-154 aircraft, SU-AXB, on 10 July 1974 after takeoff from Cairo International Airport during a training flight, killing a crew of on board. Following the crash Egyptair requested the return of its Tu-154 fleet to the Soviets and a refund for the price paid for them. The capacity shortage caused by the grounding of the Tu-154s was partly alleviated by the lease of aircraft. The airline had already been looking for other aircraft to replace them and an order for Douglas DC-9-50s was placed in November. On 9 December, an Il-18, registration YR-IMK, crashed into the Red Sea; there were fatalities. In January 1975, the government turned the order with Douglas down and moved to Boeing for the provision of new equipment. An agreement with the Soviets for the return of the Tu-154s was struck on 10 February; early in the year, the An-24s were traded back to the company that represented the Soviets as partial repayment for the loan taken to acquire the aft-engined Tu-154s. The Boeing order was finalised by March and consisted of Boeing 727-200s and Boeing 737-200s. There were plans to trade the first Boeing 707-320Cs in for the new aircraft as part of the deal with Boeing. Valued at  million, the transaction was partly financed by the United Arab Emirates. In May, the order was homogenised to Boeing 737-200s with deliveries slated for April and May 1976. Arrangements were made to sell the four Comets both to raise money to finance the new aircraft and to have an all-Boeing fleet.

A link between Cairo and Milan began in January 1976 and a new flight to Vienna started in April. Following allegations from the Egyptian parliament that airline officials had been bribed by Boeing to favour the 1975 order, the chairman Gamal Erfan resigned in February. On 22 April, a Boeing 737 flying from Cairo to Luxor was hijacked by Palestinians; an Egyptian commando team regained control of the aircraft with no damages to its structure. The Comets were sold to Dan-Air on 9 October. During the year, Boeing 737 Advanced entered the fleet. A serious accident involving a Boeing 707 took place on 25 Dec when a non-regular flight from Cairo to Tokyo crashed into a textile mill while on approach to Bangkok, killing all passengers and a crew of ; fatalities and injured people on the ground were also reported. Early in 1977, the first arrests related to the bribery case involving the Boeing order took place when a former pilot admitted he had been bribed for . In February, an agreement to lease Airbus A300B4 aircraft from Germanair and Trans European Airlines was signed. On 1 April, services to Abu Dhabi and Karachi were launched. The first A300 service flew the Cairo–Karachi route on 3 June. The lease conditions for the aircraft owned by Bavaria Germanair changed to a lease/purchase agreement. Egyptair eventually acquired the two leased A300B4 aircraft. On 21 February 1978, a Boeing 707 made an emergency landing at Sharjah Airport after hitting a flock of birds; the incident caused substantial damage to the fuselage and the engines. During 1979, A300B4-200s were ordered for  million with a delivery span between September 1980 and September 1981; the carrier took options on more aircraft of the type. Financing for the firmly ordered aircraft was partly provided by the Midland Bank and the Dresdner Bank.

At March 1980 the number of employees was 9,610 and the fleet consisted of two Airbus A300B4s, seven Boeing 707-320Cs, seven Boeing 737-200s and two Beech Barons. There was a major financial reorganisation in November 1980 when ownership of the company was shared by the National Bank of Egypt and the Misr Insurance Company. In 1981, options for two Airbus A300B4-200s were converted into a firm order. This took the count of A300 aircraft pending delivery to four. At November this year the airline had five aircraft of the type in the fleet, two of them leased. Another A300B4-200 was ordered in 1982. Overall, eight new Airbus A300B4s were introduced during the early 1980s. Three Boeing 767-200ERs (named &quot;Nefertiti&quot;, &quot;Nefertari&quot; and &quot;Tiye&quot;) were phased in during 1984. Two Boeing 767-300ERs (named &quot;Tuthmosis III&quot; and &quot;Ramses II&quot;) were phased in during 1989. On 31 October 1999, &quot;Tuthmosis III&quot; crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 217 people on board.

Egyptair is a state-owned company with special legislation permitting the management to operate as if the company were privately owned without any interference from the government. The company is self-financing without any financial backing by the Egyptian government.

The airline underwent a major corporate re-engineering in 2002 when its structure was changed from a governmental organization into a holding company with subsidiaries. The move coincided with the establishment of the Egyptian Minister of Civil Aviation and the government&#x27;s ambitious strategy to modernize and upgrade its airports and airline. The airline was given the right to operate without any interference from the government and the duty to do so without any financial backing

Egyptair wholly owns Egyptair Express and Air Sinai. The airline has stakes in Air Cairo (60%) and Smart Aviation Company (20%).

In May 2006, the airline launched a regional subsidiary called Egyptair Express with a fleet of new Embraer E-170 jets with services commencing in 2007. The carrier links Cairo with Sharm El Sheikh, Hurghada, Luxor, Aswan, Marsa Alam, Abu Simbel and Alexandria (Egypt) in addition to secondary destinations to complement the parent company&#x27;s network. In June 2009 the subsidiary received the last of the 12 Embraer E-170 aircraft on order.

This is fortified by huge assets of more than US$3.8 billion. The airline&#x27;s financial year is from July to June.
For the fiscal year ending 31 July 2007, Egyptair achieved a record total revenue of US$1.143 billion. Total group revenue grew by 14%, as compared with the previous year.

In early 2007, the airline partnered with the Egyptian Ministry of Civil Aviation and Egyptian Holding Company for Airports &amp; Air Navigation to form a new corporate airline, Smart Aviation Company, based at Cairo Airport.

In 2009, Egyptair&#x27;s operations at its Cairo International Airport hub (where it holds 61% of the airport&#x27;s departure slots) were notably overhauled due to the inauguration of the new Terminal 3 in April 2009. The airline transferred all its operations (international and domestic) to the new terminal that has more than doubled the airport&#x27;s capacity. Under the Star Alliance &quot;Move Under One Roof&quot; concept at Cairo Airport, all Star Alliance airlines serving Cairo have moved to Terminal 3. In 2010 the airline will overhaul operations at its Alexandria base by transferring operations from the older facilities at Alexandria International Airport to the new airport in Borg El Arab Airport. The airline&#x27;s CEO also stated the company was evaluating whether to set up a low-cost carrier subsidiary for its Alexandria operations to address the growth of LCCs in the city.

During the 2009–2010 Paris Airshow, the airline announced a new venture with US lessor Aviation Capital Group (ACG) and other Egyptian private and public shareholders to establish a leasing joint venture focusing on the Middle East and Northern Africa region. The new joint venture – named Civil Aviation Finance and Operating Leases (CIAF-Leasing) will initially focus on narrowbody aircraft.

Following the revolution of 2011, Egyptair is reported to have suffered considerable losses. Egypt&#x27;s civil aviation minister Wael El Maadawi said the airline lost an estimated 1.3 billion Egyptian pounds, or around $185 million, over the 2012/13 fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in fuel prices, the devaluation of the Egyptian currency and continuous strikes within the company. Losses for 2011/12 were apparently around double the 2012/13 figures. The carrier has reportedly suffered total losses of more than 7bn pounds, or nearly $1bn, since the 2011 uprising.

In the middle of 2012, a group of flight attendants asked for the right to wear hijabs as part of their work uniform. The company granted their request and hijab-wearing flight attendants first appeared in November 2012.

In November 2015, two weeks after the crash that brought down Metrojet Flight 9268 in the Sinai peninsula, Russian authorities banned Egyptair from flying to Russia, citing security concerns.

In January 2016, Egyptair was fined for leasing aircraft to Sudan Airways during 2010–11, breaking economic sanctions imposed on Sudan in 1997.

In April 2018, Russian authorities lifted the ban that prevented Egyptair from flying to Russia.

Egyptair is one of the few airlines which does not serve alcoholic beverages on its flights.

As part of a restructuring of Egyptair, Aviation Minister Air Marshall Younes Hamed announced the merger of Egyptair Express, Egyptair Cargo, and Egyptair Ground Services Company with the mainline airline. As of 4 November 2019, only Egyptair Express was officially merged with the rest of plan to be completed by the end of 2019.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership and structure===
Egyptair is a state-owned company, 100% owned by the Government of Egypt. The Egyptair Holding Company was created in 2002 with seven companies, with two further companies added at later dates.

There are three carriers, which operate under the same AOC but are managed separately and have their own profit and loss accounts:
* Egyptair Airlines, the core airline company
* EgyptAir Cargo, a dedicated cargo airline (established in 2002)
* EgyptAir Express, the domestic and regional airline (launched in June 2007)

Other companies within Egyptair Holding Company are:
* Egyptair Maintenance &amp; Engineering, originally an in-house operation but now also carrying out 3rd party business; EASA Part 145 and FAA Certified
* Egyptair Ground Services, providing services to over 75% of the air carriers flying to Egypt
* Egyptair In-flight Services
* Egyptair Tourism &amp; Duty Free Shops
* Egyptair Medical Services
* Egyptair Supplementary Industries Company (formed in 2006)

=== Subsidiaries and associates ===
The airline has stakes in:
* Air Cairo (60%)
* Smart Aviation Company (13.33%)
* Air Sinai (100%)
* Egypt Aero Management Service (50%)
* LSG Sky Chefs Catering Egypt (70%)
* CIAF-Leasing (20%)

===Business trends===
Data for the Egyptair Holding Company and for its main subsidiary Egyptair Airlines, are shown below (for years ending 30 June):
Trends for Egyptair Express and EgyptAir Cargo are shown on the relevant articles. Figures for the year ending 30 June 2011, and the lack of detailed accounts since then, reflect the disruption that occurred because of the Egyptian Revolution in early 2011.

===Head office===
EgyptAir is headquartered in the EgyptAir Administrative Complex on the grounds of Cairo International Airport in Cairo.

===Logo===
The airline&#x27;s logo is Horus, the sky deity in ancient Egyptian mythology, chosen because of its ancient symbolism as a &quot;winged god of the sun&quot;, and usually depicted as a falcon or a man with the head of a falcon.

The Horus made its first appearance in the early 1970s. It was originally painted with a red head and blue feathers in front of a golden backdrop. It was painted around the plane including the engine cases. This was due to EgyptAir wanting to keep a warm coloured livery in the early days of the airline.

==Destinations==

As of August 2022, Egyptair serves 81 destinations across 56 countries.

===Alliances===
In October 2007, the Chief Executive Board of Star Alliance voted to accept Egyptair as a future member, the first airline from an Arab country and the second African one – after South African Airways – to join the airline alliance. In a ceremony held at Cairo International Airport on 11 July 2008, the carrier became the member of this alliance, nine months after it started the joining process.

In October 2020, Egyptair reached an agreement with the government of Ghana to create a Ghanaian national aviation company with investment from both governments.

===Codeshare agreements===
Egyptair has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Aegean Airlines
* Air Cairo
* Air Canada
* Air China
* Air India

=== Suspension and resumption of service to Qatar ===
Due to the 2017 Qatar Diplomatic crisis, Egyptair (among other carriers from Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) suspended its flights to Doha&#x27;s Hamad International Airport in Qatar as per the instructions from the Egyptian Government.

In 2021, after Egypt signed the Al-&#x27;Ula declaration with Qatar (along with the rest of GCC members) Egyptair resumed flights to Doha ending its three-and-half-year boycott of Qatar.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===



, the Egyptair fleet consists of the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
In June 1995, Egyptair ordered three Airbus A340s, scheduled for delivery in December 1996. The first, 260-seater aircraft entered the fleet in late 1996, and operated along a -300 version that was on lease from Gulf Air. Also in 1995, the carrier purchased three 308-seater Boeing 777-200s for  million. These GE-90 powered aircraft, along with the A340-200s, were ordered for replacement of the Airbus A300B4 and Boeing 767-200 fleet.

Aimed to replace the Airbus A300-600R fleet, the airline placed an order for seven Airbus A330-200 aircraft in early 2003, slated for delivery in June 2004, and cancelled two Airbus A340-600s it had previously ordered. In June 2003, Egyptair signed a deal worth  million with Rolls-Royce for the provision of Trent 700 engines to power these seven A330s. The Airbus A330-300 was incorporated into the fleet in August 2010.

Egyptair&#x27;s commercial relationship with Boeing started in 1968 when a Boeing 707 was delivered. Six Boeing 737-800s were acquired in August 2005, with handovers starting in September the following year and a delivery span of three years. On lease from GECAS, Egyptair took delivery of its first 346-seater Boeing 777-300ER in March 2010.

In June 2011, the airframer delivered the airline&#x27;s Boeing aircraft, a 737-800. In July 2016, Egyptair was identified as the carrier that ordered nine more aircraft of the type, in a deal worth  million. In October 2016 the airline placed a firm order for eight Boeing 737-800s with deliveries starting in February 2017.

In October and November 2017, it was announced that the airline intended to place an order for 6 Boeing 787-9s and 15 Airbus A320neos.

During the 2019 Dubai Airshow, the initial order of 15 Airbus A320neos was changed to seven A321neos and eight A320neos instead. Also, at the same time, two additional Boeing 787-9 were ordered after the sixth and last Boeing 787-9 had been delivered in August of the same year.

<text>Eston is a former industrial town in the Redcar and Cleveland unitary area of North Yorkshire, England. It is part of Greater Eston, which includes the outlying settlements of Grangetown, Normanby, South Bank, Teesville and part of Ormesby.

== Demographics ==

The local authority ward covering the area (as well as Lackenby, Lazenby and Wilton) had a population of 7,005 at the 2011 census.

==History==

The land around Eston has been occupied since 2400 BC. The 1850 discovery of ironstone in Eston Hills by industrialist John Vaughan and mining engineer John Marley saw Eston develop from a small farming settlement in 1850 to a thriving mining town. Miners&#x27; cottages, although altered, can still be seen in parts of Eston. The mining history of Eston was the subject of &quot;A Century in Stone&quot;, which describes how the mines were responsible for making Teesside the iron and steel capital of the world.

Excluding Ormesby, the wider area came under the former Eston Urban District from 1894 until 1968. This was a single civil parish with a district council which had the ability to gain a charter to be a town and become a municipal borough, but in this case it did not. The County Borough of Teesside was created in 1968. The town remains unparished.

The Teesside steel industry that was started from these mines eventually produced the steel that built the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The mines have been closed since 1949, after 100 years of production. In 1967, the Teesside steel industry became part of the nationalised British Steel Corporation, which in turn became the Corus Group. The Middlesbrough area became the world&#x27;s leading iron and steel producing capital initially due to the output of the Eston mines.

==Politics==
Eston is part of Redcar constituency and will represented by Labour and Co-operative parties MP Anna Turley in the House of Commons following the 2024 general election.

=== 2023 local elections results ===
==== Unitary Authority ====
In the 2023 local elections, the following members were returned to Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council:
==Eston Square==
Eston Square, the shopping area on the main road passing through Eston, forms more of a triangle than a square. The square has a war memorial as its centrepiece – the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier – that shows the statue of a soldier atop a plinth. The plinth lists the names of local people who died during the World Wars.

Two sides the square are lined with traditional terraced shops, while the third side has the 1960s-built Eston Precinct parade of shops. Eston Square provides an important retail facility for a much wider area than just Eston itself. While some of the shops are well maintained businesses, others, in the words of Redcar and Cleveland Council, &quot;are in need of a facelift&quot;. As part of Redcar and Cleveland Council&#x27;s Greater Eston Regeneration, improvements are planned, including the part-demolition of the Precinct Shopping Centre and the building of a new supermarket.

==Churches==
 Eston has three major churches, two on the High Street and one in Whale Hill.
Christ Church, the Church of England church in Eston, is the partner church to St George&#x27;s Church in Teesville. Christ Church is a traditionally designed church built in red brick. It features sixteen stained-glass windows in dressed sandstone settings that bring warm colourful light into the main body of the building; they are themed around saints.

Similarly, St Anne&#x27;s Church, the Catholic church in Eston, is part of a larger parish, which includes the churches of St Peter&#x27;s, South Bank, St Andrew&#x27;s, Teesville and St Mary&#x27;s, Grangetown. The joint parish is served from, and carries the name of, St Andrew&#x27;s Parish. St Anne&#x27;s Church was built in 1970, although the Catholic community had existed as a distinct group for many years before that. Before the church was built a mass took place each Sunday at the Grangetown Royal British Legion Social Club.

==Eston Hills==
The town of Eston lies at the foot of Eston Hills, an escarpment approximately above sea level, and a part of the Cleveland Hills. The same hills that overshadow Eston were used to warn of attack in the Napoleonic Era by a beacon, the remains of which can still be seen at Eston Nab. Eston Nab is also home to the communication masts of Bauer Teesside.

At only above sea level at its highest point, Eston Hills are classed as lowland heath.

Wildlife includes lapwing, curlew, green woodpecker and linnet. There are various butterflies and dragonflies.

The hills overlooking Eston are managed for their wildlife, archaeology and amenity. Many people use the hills for walking, cycling and horse riding. There are several self-guided walk leaflets, which take in points of interest. These are available at the Flatts Lane Woodland Country Park Visitor Centre, Normanby, Redcar and Cleveland.

The Eston Hills provide access to the wider countryside via the public right of way network. The land owned or managed by the Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council is mostly bordered by farmland. Eston Nab commands an excellent view of the nearby Roseberry Topping, which stands higher at .

==Cemetery==
Still in active use, the Eston Cemetery was established in 1863 and enlarged in 1882. It built as an extension to the pre-reformation St Helen Church which was one of the many churches belonging to Gisborough Priory. St Helen&#x27;s has since been dismantled and rebuilt at Beamish Museum. The cemetery is located off Church Lane, north of Eston&#x27;s old centre.

 Names on the gravestones tell the story off the families whose daily lives created the history of the wider area, throughout the twentieth century until the present. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission is responsible for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead individually and equally, and to this end, war graves with uniform headstones, set in well kept lawns, can be found in cemeteries throughout the British Commonwealth. The Commission lists ninety-eight such graves, at Eston Cemetery, from the First and Second World Wars. The cemetery contains the war graves of 55 Commonwealth service personnel of the First World War and 43 of the Second World War, including one unidentified Royal Navy sailor.

Having more than 40 war graves, a Cross of Sacrifice designed by architect Reginald Blomfield has been erected. It shows a simple cross embedded with a bronze sword and mounted on an octagonal base to represent the faith of the majority of commemorations. It can be seen in front of the West Lodge.

The cemetery also contains the memorial obelisk to William Henry Short VC (4 February 1884 – 6 August 1916) who was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was awarded the medal after being killed showing &quot;gallantry and devotion to duty&quot; at the Battle of Contalmaison, during the Somme Offensive, in 1916.

==Whale Hill==
Eston also includes the area of Whale Hill, which was initially built between 1966 and 1970, it has mixed tenure housing. It includes a social club and a row of shops, including a chemist, post office, supermarket, fish shop, Chinese takeaway and a corner shop. The area also benefits from a large local community centre.

==Notable people==
*William Henry Short (1884–1916) – Victoria Cross recipient, born and lived at 11, William Street, Eston, until the family moved to Grangetown in 1900. He played football for Grangetown Albion and Saltburn and Lazenby United Football Clubs. He fought in the early stages of the Battle of the Somme where he was killed &quot;showing gallantry and devotion to duty&quot;. His name is recorded on the Grangetown war memorial and the obelisk in Eston Cemetery.
*Richard Douglas Sandford (1891–1918) – died as patient at Eston Hospital 12 days after the Armistice and buried at Eston Cemetery. He received the Victoria Cross for his gallantry in the Zeebrugge Raid in April 1918.
*Joseph Stoddart (1932–2019) – Consultant Anaesthetist who served in the Royal Air Force and developed the use of Intensive Care in the UK, based at the Royal Victoria Infirmary. Born in Eston.

<doc id="319373" wikidata="Q1047156" url="?curid=319373" title="The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money">
<text>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money is a book by English economist John Maynard Keynes published in February 1936. It caused a profound shift in economic thought, giving macroeconomics a central place in economic theory and contributing much of its terminology – the &quot;Keynesian Revolution&quot;. It had equally powerful consequences in economic policy, being interpreted as providing theoretical support for government spending in general, and for budgetary deficits, monetary intervention and counter-cyclical policies in particular. It is pervaded with an air of mistrust for the rationality of free-market decision-making.

Keynes denied that an economy would automatically adapt to provide full employment even in equilibrium, and believed that the volatile and ungovernable psychology of markets would lead to periodic booms and crises. The &quot;General Theory&quot; is a sustained attack on the classical economics orthodoxy of its time. It introduced the concepts of the consumption function, the principle of effective demand and liquidity preference, and gave new prominence to the multiplier and the marginal efficiency of capital.
==Keynes&#x27;s aims in the &quot;General Theory&quot;==
The central argument of &quot;The General Theory&quot; is that the level of employment is determined not by the price of labour, as in classical economics, but by the level of aggregate demand. If the total demand for goods at full employment is less than the total output, then the economy has to contract until equality is achieved. Keynes thus denied that full employment was the natural result of competitive markets in equilibrium.

In this he challenged the conventional (&#x27;classical&#x27;) economic wisdom of his day. In a letter to his friend George Bernard Shaw on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1935, he wrote:

I believe myself to be writing a book on economic theory which will largely revolutionize – not I suppose, at once but in the course of the next ten years – the way the world thinks about its economic problems. I can&#x27;t expect you, or anyone else, to believe this at the present stage. But for myself I don&#x27;t merely hope what I say, – in my own mind, I&#x27;m quite sure.

The first chapter of &quot;The General Theory&quot; (only half a page long) has a similarly radical tone:
I have called this book the &quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, placing the emphasis on the prefix &quot;general&quot;. The object of such a title is to contrast the character of my arguments and conclusions with those of the classical theory of the subject, upon which I was brought up and which dominates the economic thought, both practical and theoretical, of the governing and academic classes of this generation, as it has for a hundred years past. I shall argue that the postulates of the classical theory are applicable to a special case only and not to the general case, the situation which it assumes being a limiting point of the possible positions of equilibrium. Moreover, the characteristics of the special case assumed by the classical theory happen not to be those of the economic society in which we actually live, with the result that its teaching is misleading and disastrous if we attempt to apply it to the facts of experience.

==Summary of the &quot;General Theory&quot;==
Keynes&#x27;s main theory (including its dynamic elements) is presented in Chapters 2–15, 18, and 22, which are summarised here. A shorter account will be found in the article on Keynesian economics. The remaining chapters of Keynes&#x27;s book contain amplifications of various sorts and are described later in this article.

===Book I: Introduction===
The first book of &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; is a repudiation of Say&#x27;s law. The classical view for which Keynes made Say a mouthpiece held that the value of wages was equal to the value of the goods produced, and that the wages were inevitably put back into the economy sustaining demand at the level of current production. Hence, starting from full employment, there cannot be a glut of industrial output leading to a loss of jobs. As Keynes put it on p. 18, &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot;.

====Stickiness of wages in money terms====
Say&#x27;s law depends on the operation of a market economy. If there is unemployment (and if there are no distortions preventing the employment market from adjusting to it) then there will be workers willing to offer their labour at less than the current wage levels, leading to downward pressure on wages and increased offers of jobs.

The classics held that full employment was the equilibrium condition of an undistorted labour market, but they and Keynes agreed in the existence of distortions impeding transition to equilibrium. The classical position had generally been to view the distortions as the culprit and to argue that their removal was the main tool for eliminating unemployment. Keynes on the other hand viewed the market distortions as part of the economic fabric and advocated different policy measures which (as a separate consideration) had social consequences which he personally found congenial and which he expected his readers to see in the same light.

The distortions which have prevented wage levels from adapting downwards have lain in employment contracts being expressed in monetary terms; in various forms of legislation such as the minimum wage and in state-supplied benefits; in the unwillingness of workers to accept reductions in their income; and in their ability through unionisation to resist the market forces exerting downward pressure on them.

Keynes accepted the classical relation between wages and the marginal productivity of labour, referring to it on page 5 as the &quot;first postulate of classical economics&quot; and summarising it as saying that &quot;The wage is equal to the marginal product of labour&quot;.

The first postulate can be expressed in the equation y&#x27;(N) = W/p, where y(N) is the real output when employment is N, and W and p are the wage rate and price rate in money terms (and hence W/p is the wage rate in real terms). A system can be analysed on the assumption that W is fixed (i.e. that wages are fixed in money terms) or that W/p is fixed (i.e. that they are fixed in real terms) or that N is fixed (e.g. if wages adapt to ensure full employment). All three assumptions had at times been made by classical economists, but under the assumption of wages fixed in money terms the &#x27;first postulate&#x27; becomes an equation in two variables (N and p), and the consequences of this had not been taken into account by the classical school.

Keynes proposed a &#x27;second postulate of classical economics&#x27; asserting that the wage is equal to the marginal disutility of labour. This is an instance of wages being fixed in real terms. He attributes the second postulate to the classics subject to the qualification that unemployment may result from wages being fixed by legislation, collective bargaining, or &#x27;mere human obstinacy&#x27; (p. 6), all of which are likely to fix wages in money terms.

====Outline of Keynes&#x27;s theory====
Keynes&#x27;s economic theory is based on the interaction between demands for saving, investment, and liquidity (i.e. money). Saving and investment are necessarily equal, but different factors influence decisions concerning them. The desire to save, in Keynes&#x27;s analysis, is mostly a function of income: the wealthier people are, the more wealth they will seek to put aside. The profitability of investment, on the other hand, is determined by the relation between the return available to capital and the interest rate. The economy needs to find its way to an equilibrium in which no more money is being saved than will be invested, and this can be accomplished by contraction of income and a consequent reduction in the level of employment.

In the classical scheme it is the interest rate rather than income which adjusts to maintain equilibrium between saving and investment; but Keynes asserts that the rate of interest already performs another function in the economy, that of equating demand and supply of money, and that it cannot adjust to maintain two separate equilibria. In his view it is the monetary role which wins out. This is why Keynes&#x27;s theory is a theory of money as much as of employment: the monetary economy of interest and liquidity interacts with the real economy of production, investment and consumption.

===Book II: Definitions and ideas===
====The choice of units====

Keynes sought to allow for the lack of downwards flexibility of wages by constructing an economic model in which the money supply and wage rates were externally determined (the latter in money terms), and in which the main variables were fixed by the equilibrium conditions of various markets in the presence of these facts.

Many of the quantities of interest, such as income and consumption, are monetary. Keynes often expresses such quantities in wage units (Chapter 4): to be precise, a value in wage units is equal to its price in money terms divided by W, the wage (in money units) per man-hour of labour. Therefore it is a unit expressed in hours of labour. Keynes generally writes a subscript w on quantities expressed in wage units, but in this account we omit the w. When, occasionally, we use real terms for a value which Keynes expresses in wage units we write it in lower case (e.g. y rather than Y).

As a result of Keynes&#x27;s choice of units, the assumption of sticky wages, though important to the argument, is largely invisible in the reasoning. If we want to know how a change in the wage rate would influence the economy, Keynes tells us on p. 266 that the effect is the same as that of an opposite change in the money supply.

====Expectations as determining output and employment====
The key notion of expectations is introduced in Chapter 5.&quot;Short-term expectations&quot; are &#x27;concerned with the price which a manufacturer can expect to get for his &quot;finished&quot; output at the time when he commits himself (sic) to starting the process which will produce it&#x27;. &quot;Long-term expectation&quot; &#x27;is concerned with what the entrepreneur can hope to earn in the shape of future returns if he (sic) purchases (or perhaps manufactures) &quot;finished&quot; output as an addition to his capital equipment.&#x27;

Keynes note that:&#x27;It is sensible for producers to base their expectations on the assumption that the most recently realized results will continue, except in so far as there are definite reasons for expecting a change.&#x27; However (see Chapter 12) long-term expectations are liable to sudden revision. Thus the factor of long-term expectations cannot be even approximately eliminated or replaced by realized results.&#x27;

Briefly, short-run expectations are typically &#x27;mathematical&#x27; in character, long-run expectations less so.

====The identity of saving and investment====
The relationship between saving and investment, and the factors influencing their demands, play an important role in Keynes&#x27;s model. Saving and investment are considered to be necessarily equal for reasons set out in Chapter 6 which looks at economic aggregates from the viewpoint of manufacturers. The discussion is intricate, considering matters such as the depreciation of machinery, but is summarised on p. 63:

Provided it is agreed that income is equal to the value of current output, that current investment is equal to the value of that part of current output which is not consumed, and that saving is equal to the excess of income over consumption... the equality of saving and investment necessarily follows.

This statement incorporates Keynes&#x27;s definition of saving, which is the normal one.

===Book III: The propensity to consume===

Book III of the &quot;General Theory&quot; is given over to the propensity to consume, which is introduced in Chapter 8 as the desired level of expenditure on consumption (for an individual or aggregated over an economy). The demand for consumer goods depends chiefly on the income Y and may be written functionally as C(Y). Saving is that part of income which is not consumed, so the propensity to save S(Y) is equal to Y–C(Y). Keynes discusses the possible influence of the interest rate r on the relative attractiveness of saving and consumption, but regards it as &#x27;complex and uncertain&#x27; and leaves it out as a parameter.

His seemingly innocent definitions embody an assumption whose consequences will be considered later. Since Y is measured in wage units, the proportion of income saved is considered to be unaffected by the change in real income resulting from a change in the price level while wages stay fixed. Keynes acknowledges that this is undesirable in Point (1) of Section II.

In Chapter 9 he provides a homiletic enumeration of the motives to consume or not to do so, finding them to lie in social and psychological considerations which can be expected to be relatively stable, but which may be influenced by objective factors such as &#x27;changes in expectations of the relation between the present and the future level of income&#x27; (p. 95).

====The marginal propensity to consume and the multiplier====
The &quot;marginal propensity to consume&quot;, C&#x27;(Y), is the gradient of the purple curve, and the marginal propensity to save S&#x27;(Y) is equal to 1–C&#x27;(Y). Keynes states as a &#x27;fundamental psychological law&#x27; (p. 96) that the marginal propensity to consume will be positive and less than unity.

Chapter 10 introduces the famous &#x27;multiplier&#x27; through an example: if the marginal propensity to consume is 90%, then &#x27;the multiplier k is 10; and the total employment caused by (e.g.) increased public works will be ten times the employment caused by the public works themselves&#x27; (pp. 116f). Formally Keynes writes the multiplier as k=1/S&#x27;(Y). It follows from his &#x27;fundamental psychological law&#x27; that k will be greater than 1.

Keynes&#x27;s account is not clear until his economic system has been fully set out (see below). In Chapter 10 he describes his multiplier as being related to the one introduced by R. F. Kahn in 1931. The mechanism of Kahn&#x27;s multiplier lies in an infinite series of transactions, each conceived of as creating employment: if you spend a certain amount of money, then the recipient will spend a proportion of what he or she receives, the second recipient will spend a further proportion again, and so forth. Keynes&#x27;s account of his own mechanism (in the second para of p. 117) makes no reference to infinite series. By the end of the chapter on the multiplier, he uses his much quoted &quot;digging holes&quot; metaphor, against &quot;laissez-faire&quot;. In his provocation Keynes argues that &quot;If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the banknotes up again&quot; (...), there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than nothing&quot;.

===Book IV: The inducement to invest===
====The rate of investment====
Book IV discusses the inducement to invest, with the key ideas being presented in Chapter 11. The &#x27;marginal efficiency of capital&#x27; is defined as the annual revenue which is expected to be yielded by an extra increment of capital as a proportion of its cost. The &#x27;schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital&#x27; is the function which, for any rate of interest r, gives us the level of investment which will take place if all opportunities are accepted whose return is at least r. By construction this depends on r alone and is a decreasing function of its argument; it is illustrated in the diagram, and we shall write it as I (r).

This schedule is a characteristic of the current industrial process which Irving Fisher described as representing the &#x27;investment opportunity side of interest theory&#x27;; and in fact the condition that it should equal S(Y,r) is the equation which determines the interest rate from income in classical theory. Keynes is seeking to reverse the direction of causality (and omitting r as an argument to S()).

He interprets the schedule as expressing the demand for investment at any given value of r, giving it an alternative name: &quot;We shall call this the investment demand-schedule...&quot; (p. 136). He also refers to it as the &#x27;demand curve for capital&#x27; (p. 178). 
For fixed industrial conditions, we conclude that &#x27;the amount of investment... depends on the rate of interest&#x27; as John Hicks put it in &#x27;Mr. Keynes and the &quot;Classics&quot;&#x27;.

====Long-term expectations====
In Chapter 12, Keynes writes:
It would be foolish, in forming our expectations, to attach great weight to matters which are very uncertain. [Footnote: By “very uncertain’ I do not mean the same thing as improbable”. Cf. my Treatise on Probability, chap. 6, on “The Weight of Arguments”.] It is reasonable, therefore, to be guided to a considerable degree by the facts about which we feel somewhat confident, even though they may be less decisively relevant to the issue than other facts about which our knowledge is vague and scanty. For this reason the facts of the existing situation enter, in a sense disproportionately, into the formation of our long-term expectations; our usual practice being to take the existing situation and to project it into the future, modified only to the extent that we have more or less definite reasons for expecting a change.
He goes on thus: ‘In practice we have tacitly agreed, as a rule, to fall back on what is, in truth, a &quot;convention&quot; ’. He notes that ‘our existing knowledge does not provide a sufficient basis for a calculated mathematical expectation.’ ‘Nevertheless the above conventional method of calculation will be compatible with a considerable measure of continuity and stability in our affairs, &quot;so long as we can rely on the maintenance of the convention&quot;.’

He notes a practical problem: ‘Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.’ He suggests that: ‘The introduction of a substantial Government transfer tax on all transactions might prove the most serviceable reform available, with a view to mitigating the predominance of speculation over enterprise in the United States.’

To account for the apparent ‘foolishness’ on which economic progress seemed to rely, Keynes suggests that:
Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of &quot;animal spirits&quot; – of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.

====Interest and liquidity preference====
Keynes proposes two theories of liquidity preference (i.e. the demand for money): the first as a theory of interest in Chapter 13 and the second as a correction in Chapter 15. His arguments offer ample scope for criticism, but his final conclusion is that liquidity preference is a function mainly of income and the interest rate. The influence of income (which really represents a composite of income and wealth) is common ground with the classical tradition and is embodied in the Quantity Theory; the influence of interest had also been noted earlier, in particular by Frederick Lavington (see Hicks&#x27;s Mr Keynes and the &quot;Classics&quot;). Thus Keynes&#x27;s final conclusion may be acceptable to readers who question the arguments along the way. However he shows a persistent tendency to think in terms of the Chapter 13 theory while nominally accepting the Chapter 15 correction.

Chapter 13 presents the first theory in rather metaphysical terms. Keynes argues that:
It should be obvious that the rate of interest cannot be a return to saving or waiting as such. For if a man hoards his savings in cash, he earns no interest, though he saves just as much as before. On the contrary, the mere definition of the rate of interest tells us in so many words that the rate of interest is the reward for parting with liquidity for a specified period.
To which Jacob Viner retorted that:
By analogous reasoning he could deny that wages are the reward for labor, or that profit is the reward for risk-taking, because labor is sometimes done without anticipation or realization of a return, and men who assume financial risks have been known to incur losses as a result instead of profits.
Keynes goes on to claim that the demand for money is a function of the interest rate alone on the grounds that:
The rate of interest is... the &quot;price&quot; which equilibrates the desire to hold wealth in the form of cash with the available quantity of cash.
Frank Knight commented that this seems to assume that demand is simply an inverse function of price. The upshot from these reasonings is that:
Liquidity-preference is a potentiality or functional tendency, which fixes the quantity of money which the public will hold when the rate of interest is given; so that if r is the rate of interest, M the quantity of money and L the function of liquidity-preference, we have M = L(r). This is where, and how, the quantity of money enters into the economic scheme.
And specifically it determines the rate of interest, which therefore cannot be determined by the traditional factors of &#x27;productivity and thrift&#x27;.

Chapter 15 looks in more detail at the three motives Keynes ascribes for the holding of money: the &#x27;transactions motive&#x27;, the &#x27;precautionary motive&#x27;, and the &#x27;speculative motive&#x27;. He considers that demand arising from the first two motives &#x27;mainly depends on the level of income&#x27; (p. 199), while the interest rate is &#x27;likely to be a minor factor&#x27; (p. 196).

Keynes treats the speculative demand for money as a function of r alone without justifying its independence of income. He says that...
what matters is not the &quot;absolute&quot; level of r but the degree of its divergence from what is considered a fairly &quot;safe&quot; level...
but gives reasons to suppose that demand will nonetheless tend to decrease as r increases. He thus writes liquidity preference in the form L1(Y)+L2(r) where L1 is the sum of transaction and precautionary demands and L2 measures speculative demand. The structure of Keynes&#x27;s expression plays no part in his subsequent theory, so it does no harm to follow Hicks by writing liquidity preference simply as L(Y,r).

&#x27;The quantity of money as determined by the action of the central bank&#x27; is taken as given (i.e. exogenous – p. 247) and constant (because hoarding is ruled out on page 174 by the fact that the necessary expansion of the money supply cannot be &#x27;determined by the public&#x27;).

Keynes does not put a subscript &#x27;w&#x27; on L or M, implying that we should think of them in money terms. This suggestion is reinforced by his wording on page 172 where he says &quot;Unless we measure liquidity-preference in terms of wage-units (which is convenient in some contexts)... &quot;. But seventy pages later there is a fairly clear statement that liquidity preference and the quantity of money are indeed &quot;measured in terms of wage-units&quot; (p. 246).

===The Keynesian economic system===
====Keynes&#x27;s economic model====
In Chapter 14 Keynes contrasts the classical theory of interest with his own, and in making the comparison he shows how his system can be applied to explain all the principal economic unknowns from the facts he takes as given. The two topics can be treated together because they are different ways of analysing the same equation.

Keynes&#x27;s presentation is informal. To make it more precise we will identify a set of 4 variables – saving, investment, the rate of interest, and the national income – and a parallel set of 4 equations which jointly determine them. The graph illustrates the reasoning. The red S lines are shown as increasing functions of r in obedience to classical theory; for Keynes they should be horizontal.

The first equation asserts that the reigning rate of interest r̂ is determined from the amount of money in circulation M̂ through the liquidity preference function and the assumption that L(r̂)=M̂.

The second equation fixes the level of investment Î given the rate of interest through the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital as I(r̂).

The third equation tells us that saving is equal to investment: S(Y)=Î. The final equation tells us that the income Ŷ is the value of Y corresponding to the implied level of saving.

All this makes a satisfying theoretical system.

Three comments can be made concerning the argument. Firstly, no use is made of the &#x27;first postulate of classical economics&#x27;, which can be called on later to set the price level. Secondly, Hicks (in &#x27;Mr Keynes and the &quot;Classics&quot;&#x27;) presents his version of Keynes&#x27;s system with a single variable representing both saving and investment; so his exposition has three equations in three unknowns.

And finally, since Keynes&#x27;s discussion takes place in Chapter 14, it precedes the modification which makes liquidity preference depend on income as well as on the rate of interest. Once this modification has been made the unknowns can no longer be recovered sequentially.

====Keynesian economic intervention====
The state of the economy, according to Keynes, is determined by four parameters: the money supply, the demand functions for consumption (or equivalently for saving) and for liquidity, and the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital determined by &#x27;the existing quantity of equipment&#x27; and &#x27;the state of long-term expectation&#x27; (p. 246).Adjusting the money supply is the domain of monetary policy. The effect of a change in the quantity of money is considered at p. 298. The change is effected in the first place in money units. According to Keynes&#x27;s account on p. 295, wages will not change if there is any unemployment, with the result that the money supply will change to the same extent in wage units.

We can then analyse its effect from the diagram, in which we see that an increase in M̂ shifts r̂ to the left, pushing Î upwards and leading to an increase in total income (and employment) whose size depends on the gradients of all 3 demand functions. If we look at the change in income as a function of the upwards shift of the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital (blue curve), we see that as the level of investment is increased by one unit, the income must adjust so that the level of saving (red curve) is one unit greater, and hence the increase in income must be 
1/S&#x27;(Y) units, i.e. k units. This is the explanation of Keynes&#x27;s multiplier.

It does not necessarily follow that individual decisions to invest will have a similar effect, since decisions to invest above the level suggested by the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital are not the same thing as an increase in the schedule.

====The equations of Keynesian and classical economics====
Keynes&#x27;s initial statement of his economic model (in Chapter 14) is based on his Chapter 13 theory of liquidity preference. His restatement in Chapter 18 doesn&#x27;t take full account of his Chapter 15 revision, treating it as a source of &#x27;repercussions&#x27; rather than as an integral component. It was left to John Hicks to give a satisfactory presentation. Equilibrium between supply and demand of money depends on two variables – interest rate and income – and these are the same two variables as are related by the equation between the propensity to save and the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital. It follows that neither equation can be solved in isolation and that they need to be considered simultaneously.

The &#x27;first postulate&#x27; of classical economics was also accepted as valid by Keynes, though not used in the first four books of the &quot;General Theory&quot;. The Keynesian system can thus be represented by three equations in three variables as shown below, roughly following Hicks. Three analogous equations can be given for classical economics. As presented below they are in forms given by Keynes himself (the practice of writing r as an argument to V derives from his &quot;Treatise on money&quot;).
Here y is written as a function of N, the number of workers employed; p is the price (in money terms) of a unit of real output; V(r) is the velocity of money; and W is the wage rate in money terms. N, p and r are the 3 variables we need to recover. In the Keynesian system income is measured in wage units and is therefore not a function of the level of employment alone since it will also vary with prices. The first postulate assumes that prices can be represented by a single variable. Strictly it should be modified to take account of the distinction between marginal wage cost and marginal prime cost.

The classics took the second equation as determining the rate of interest, the third as determining the price level, and the first as determining employment. Keynes believed that the last two equations could be solved together for Y and r, which is not possible in the classical system. He accordingly concentrated on these two equations, treating income as &#x27;almost the same thing&#x27; as employment on p. 247. Here we see the benefit he has gained by simplifying the form of the consumption function. If he had written it (slightly more accurately) as C(Y,p/W), then he would have needed to bring in the first equation to get a solution.

If we wish to examine the classical system our task is made easier if we assume that the effect of the interest rate on the velocity of circulation is small enough to be ignored. This allows us to treat V as constant and solve the first and third equations (the &#x27;first postulate&#x27; and the quantity theory) together, leaving the second equation to determine the interest rate from the result. We then find that the level of employment is given by the formula

formula_1.

The graph shows the numerator and denominator of the left-hand side as blue and green curves; their ratio – the pink curve – will be a decreasing function of N even if we don&#x27;t assume diminishing marginal returns. The level of employment N̂ is given by the horizontal position at which the pink curve has a value of formula_2, and this is evidently a decreasing function of W.

====Chapter 3: The principle of effective demand====
The theoretical system we have described is developed over chapters 4–18, and is anticipated by a chapter which interprets Keynesian unemployment in terms of &#x27;aggregate demand&#x27;.

The &quot;aggregate supply Z&quot; is the total value of output when N workers are employed, written functionally as φ(N). The aggregate demand D is manufacturers&#x27; expected proceeds, written as f(N). In equilibrium Z=D. D can be decomposed as D1+D2 where D1 is the propensity to consume, which may be written C(Y) or χ(N). D2 is explained as &#x27;the volume of investment&#x27;, and the equilibrium condition determining the level of employment is that D1+D2 should equal Z as functions of N. D2 can be identified with I (r).

The meaning of this is that in equilibrium the total demand for goods must equal total income. Total demand for goods is the sum of demand for consumption goods and demand for investment goods. Hence 
Y = C(Y) + S(Y) = C(Y) + I (r); and this equation determines a unique value of Y given r.

Samuelson&#x27;s Keynesian cross is a graphical representation of the Chapter 3 argument.

===Dynamic aspects of Keynes&#x27;s theory===
====Chapter 5: Expectation as determining output and employment====
Chapter 5 makes some common-sense observations on the role of expectation in economics. Short-term expectations govern the level of production chosen by an entrepreneur while long-term expectations govern decisions to adjust the level of capitalisation. Keynes describes the process by which the level of employment adapts to a change in long-term expectations and remarks that:
The level of employment at any time depends... not merely on the existing state of expectation but on the states of expectation which have existed over a certain past period. Nevertheless past expectations, which have not yet worked themselves out, are embodied in to-day&#x27;s capital equipment... and only influence [the entrepreneur&#x27;s] decisions in so far as they are so embodied.

====Chapter 11: Expectation as influencing the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital====
The main role of expectation in Keynes&#x27;s theory lies in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital which, as we have seen, is defined in Chapter 11 in terms of &quot;expected&quot; returns. Keynes differs here from Fisher whom he largely follows, but who defined the &#x27;rate of return over cost&#x27; in terms of an actual revenue stream rather than its expectation. The step Keynes took here has a particular significance in his theory.

====Chapters 14, 18: The schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital as influencing employment====
Keynes differed from his classical predecessors in assigning a role to the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital in determining the level of employment. Its effect is mentioned in his presentations of his theory in Chapters 14 and 18 (see above).

====Chapter 12: Animal spirits====
Chapter 12 discusses the psychology of speculation and enterprise.

Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive ... can only be taken as a result of animal spirits .. Thus if the animal spirits are dimmed and spontaneous optimism falters, leaving us to depend on nothing but a mathematical expectation, enterprise will fade and die.

Keynes&#x27;s picture of the psychology of speculators is less indulgent. 
In point of fact, all sorts of considerations enter into the market valuation which are in no way relevant to the prospective yield... The recurrence of a bank-holiday may raise the market valuation of the British railway system by several million pounds.
(Work in behavioural economics has since empirically supported Keynes&#x27; assertion; businesses which are extremely seasonal do indeed see notably higher valuations in the season in question, even if their results are consistent in that quarter from year to year).

Keynes considers speculators to be concerned...
...not with what an investment is really worth to a man who buys it &#x27;for keeps&#x27;, but with what the market will value it at, under the influence of mass psychology, three months or a year hence...
This battle of wits to anticipate the basis of conventional valuation a few months hence, rather than the prospective yield of an investment over a long term of years, does not even require gulls amongst the public to feed the maws of the professional;– it can be played by professionals amongst themselves. Nor is it necessary that anyone should keep his simple faith in the conventional basis of valuation having any genuine long-term validity. For it is, so to speak, a game of Snap, of Old Maid, of Musical Chairs – a pastime in which he is victor who says Snap neither too soon nor too late, who passed the Old Maid to his neighbour before the game is over, who secures a chair for himself when the music stops. These games can be played with zest and enjoyment, though all the players know that it is the Old Maid which is circulating, or that when the music stops some of the players will find themselves unseated.
Or, to change the metaphor slightly, professional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view. It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of one&#x27;s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practise the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.

====Chapter 21: Wage behaviour====
Keynes&#x27;s theory of the trade cycle is a theory of the slow oscillation of money income which requires it to be possible for income to move upwards or downwards. If he had assumed that wages were constant, then upward motion of income would have been impossible at full employment, and he would have needed some mechanism to frustrate upward pressure if it arose in such circumstances.

His task is made easier by a less restrictive (but nonetheless crude) assumption concerning wage behaviour:
let us simplify our assumptions still further, and assume... that the factors of production... are content with the same money-wage so long as there is a surplus of them unemployed... ; whilst as soon as full employment is reached, it will thenceforward be the wage-unit and prices which will increase in exact proportion to the increase in effective demand.

====Chapter 22: The trade cycle====
Keynes&#x27;s theory of the trade cycle is based on &#x27;a cyclical change in the marginal efficiency of capital&#x27; induced by &#x27;the uncontrollable and disobedient psychology of the business world&#x27; (pp. 313, 317).
The marginal efficiency of capital depends... on current expectations... But, as we have seen, the basis for such expectations is very precarious. Being based on shifting and unreliable evidence, they are subject to sudden and violent changes.
Optimism leads to a rise in the marginal efficiency of capital and increased investment, reflected – through the multiplier – in an even greater increase in income until &#x27;disillusion falls upon an over-optimistic and over-bought market&#x27; which consequently falls with &#x27;sudden and even catastrophic force&#x27; (p. 316). 
There are reasons, given firstly by the length of life of durable assets... and secondly by the carrying-costs of surplus stocks, why the duration of the downward movement should have an order of magnitude... between, let us say, three and five years.
And a half cycle of 5 years tallies with Jevons&#x27;s sunspot cycle length of 11 years.

Income fluctuates cyclically in Keynes&#x27;s theory, with the effect being borne by prices if income increases during a period of full employment, and by employment in other circumstances.

====Wage behaviour and the Phillips curve====
Keynes&#x27;s assumption about wage behaviour has been the subject of much criticism. It is likely that wage rates adapt partially to depression conditions, with the consequence that effects on employment are weaker than his model implies, but not that they disappear.

Lerner pointed out in the 40s that it was optimistic to hope that the workforce would be content with fixed wages in the presence of rising prices, and proposed a modification to Keynes&#x27;s model. After this a succession of more elaborate models were constructed, many associated with the Phillips curve.

Keynes&#x27;s optimistic prediction that an increase in money supply would be taken up by an increase in employment led to Jacob Viner&#x27;s pessimistic prediction that &quot;in a world organized in accordance with Keynes&#x27; specifications there would be a constant race between the printing press and the business agents of the trade unions&quot;.

Models of wage pressure on the economy needed frequent correction and the standing of Keynesian theory suffered. Geoff Tily wrote ruefully:
Finally, the most destructive step of all was Samuelson&#x27;s and [Robert] Solow&#x27;s incorporation of the Phillips curve into &#x27;Keynesian&#x27; theory in a manner which traduced not only Phillips but also Keynes&#x27;s careful work in the &quot;General Theory&quot;, Chapter 21, substituting for its subtlety an immutable relationship between inflation and employment. The 1970s combination of inflation and stagnating economic activity was at odds with this relationship, and therefore &#x27;Keynesianism&#x27;, and by association Keynes were rejected. Monetarism was merely waiting in the wings for this to happen.

Keynes&#x27;s assumption of wage behaviour was not an integral part of his theory – very little in his book depends on it – and was avowedly a simplification: in fact it was the simplest assumption he could make without imposing an unnatural cap on money income.

==The writing of the &quot;General Theory&quot;==
Keynes drew a lot of help from his students in his progress from the &quot;Treatise on Money&quot;  (1930) to the &quot;General Theory&quot;  (1936). The Cambridge Circus, a discussion group founded immediately after the publication of the earlier work, reported to Keynes through Richard Kahn, and drew his attention to a supposed fallacy in the &quot;Treatise&quot;  where Keynes had written:
Thus profits, as a source of capital increment for entrepreneurs, are a widow&#x27;s cruse which remains undepleted however much of them may be devoted to riotous living.
The &quot;Circus&quot;  disbanded in May 1931, but three of its member – Kahn, Austin and Joan Robinson – continued to meet in the Robinsons&#x27; house in Trumpington St. (Cambridge), forwarding comments to Keynes. This led to a &#x27;Manifesto&#x27; of 1932 whose ideas were taken up by Keynes in his lectures. Kahn and Joan Robinson were well versed in marginalist theory which Keynes did not fully understand at the time (or possibly ever), pushing him towards adopting elements of it in the &quot;General Theory&quot;. During 1934 and 1935 Keynes submitted drafts to Kahn, Robinson and Roy Harrod for comment.

There has been uncertainty ever since over the extent of the collaboration, Schumpeter describing Kahn&#x27;s &quot;share in the historic achievement&quot; as not having &quot;fallen very far short of co-authorship&quot; while Kahn denied the attribution.

Keynes&#x27;s method of writing was unusual:
Keynes drafted rapidly in pencil, reclining in an armchair. The pencil draft he sent straight to the printers. They supplied him with a considerable number of galley proofs, which he would then distribute to his advisers and critics for comment and amendment. As he published on his own account, Macmillan &amp; Co., the &#x27;publishers&#x27; (in reality they were distributors), could not object to the expense of Keynes&#x27; method of operating. They came out of Keynes&#x27; profit (Macmillan &amp; Co. merely received a commission). Keynes&#x27; object was to simplify the process of circulating drafts; and eventually to secure good sales by fixing the retail price lower than would Macmillan &amp; Co.

The advantages of self-publication can be seen from Étienne Mantoux&#x27;s review:
When he published &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; last year at the sensational price of 5 shillings, J. M. Keynes perhaps meant to express a wish for the broadest and earliest possible dissemination of his new ideas.

===Chronology===
Keynes&#x27;s work on the &quot;General Theory&quot; began as soon as his &quot;Treatise on Money&quot; had been published in 1930. He was already dissatisfied with what he had written and wanted to extend the scope of his theory to output and employment. By September 1932 he was able to write to his mother: &#x27;I have written nearly a third of my new book on monetary theory&#x27;.

In autumn 1932 he delivered lectures at Cambridge under the title &#x27;the monetary theory of production&#x27; whose content was close to the &quot;Treatise&quot; except in giving prominence to a liquidity preference theory of interest. There was no consumption function and no theory of effective demand. Wage rates were discussed in a criticism of Pigou.

In autumn 1933 Keynes&#x27;s lectures were much closer to the &quot;General Theory&quot;, including the consumption function, effective demand, and a statement of &#x27;the inability of workers to bargain for a market-clearing real wage in a monetary economy&#x27;. All that was missing was a theory of investment.

By spring 1934 Chapter 12 was in its final form.

His lectures in autumn of that year bore the title &#x27;the general theory of employment&#x27;. In these lectures Keynes presented the marginal efficiency of capital in much the same form as it took in Chapter 11, his &#x27;basic chapter&#x27; as Kahn called it. He gave a talk on the same subject to economists at Oxford in February 1935.

This was the final building block of the &quot;General Theory&quot;. The book was finished in December 1935 and published in February 1936.

===Observations on its readability===
Many economists found &quot;General Theory&quot; difficult to read, with Étienne Mantoux calling it obscure, Frank Knight calling it difficult to follow, Michel DeVroey commenting that &quot;many passages of his book were almost indecipherable&quot;., and Paul Samuelson calling the analysis &quot;unpalatable&quot; and incomprehensible.
However Raúl Rojas dissents, saying that &quot;obscure neo-classical reinterpretations&quot; are &quot;completely pointless since Keynes&#x27; book is so readable&quot;.

==Reception==
Keynes did not set out a detailed policy program in &quot;The General Theory&quot;, but he went on in practice to place great emphasis on the reduction of long-term interest rates and the reform of the international monetary system as structural measures needed to encourage both investment and consumption by the private sector. Paul Samuelson said that the General Theory &quot;caught most economists under the age of 35 with the unexpected virulence of a disease first attacking and decimating an isolated tribe of South Sea islanders.&quot;

===Praise===
Many of the innovations introduced by &quot;The General Theory&quot; continue to be central to modern macroeconomics. For instance, the idea that recessions reflect inadequate aggregate demand and that Say&#x27;s law (in Keynes&#x27;s formulation, that &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot;) does not hold in a monetary economy. President Richard Nixon famously said in 1971 (ironically, shortly before Keynesian economics fell out of fashion) that &quot;We are all Keynesians now&quot;, a phrase often repeated by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman (but originating with anti-Keynesian economist Milton Friedman, said in a way different from Krugman&#x27;s interpretation). Nevertheless, starting with Axel Leijonhufvud, this view of Keynesian economics came under increasing challenge and scrutiny and has now divided into two main camps.

Prior to the financial crises of 2007-9, the majority new consensus view, still found in most current text-books and taught in all universities, was New Keynesian economics, which (in contrast to Keynes) accepts the neoclassical concept of long-run equilibrium but allows a role for aggregate demand in the short run. New Keynesian economists pride themselves on providing microeconomic foundations for the sticky prices and wages assumed by Old Keynesian economics. They do not regard &quot;The General Theory&quot; itself as helpful to further research. The minority view is represented by post-Keynesian economists, all of whom accept Keynes&#x27;s fundamental critique of the neoclassical concept of long-run equilibrium, and some of whom think &quot;The General Theory&quot; has yet to be properly understood and repays further study.

In 2011, the book was placed on &quot;Time&quot;″s top 100 non-fiction books written in English since 1923, almost 400 universities are teaching a revised curriculum that takes instability seriously and Keynes&#x27;s notion of uncertainty has become more familiar as &#x27;radical uncertainty&#x27;.

===Criticisms===

From the outset there has been controversy over what Keynes really meant. Many early reviews were highly critical. The success of what came to be known as &quot;neoclassical synthesis&quot; Keynesian economics owed a great deal to the Harvard economist Alvin Hansen and MIT economist Paul Samuelson as well as to the Oxford economist John Hicks. Hansen and Samuelson offered a lucid explanation of Keynes&#x27;s theory of aggregate demand with their elegant 45° Keynesian cross diagram while Hicks created the IS-LM diagram. Both of these diagrams can still be found in textbooks. Post-Keynesians argue that the neoclassical Keynesian model is completely distorting and misinterpreting Keynes&#x27; original meaning, at least in so far as it largely rests on an assumed long-term equilibrium.

Just as the reception of &quot;The General Theory&quot; was encouraged by the 1930s experience of mass unemployment, its fall from favour was associated with the &#x27;stagflation&#x27; of the 1970s. Although few modern economists would disagree with the need for at least some intervention, policies such as labour market flexibility are underpinned by the neoclassical notion of equilibrium in the long run. Although Keynes explicitly addresses inflation, &quot;The General Theory&quot; does not treat it as an essentially monetary phenomenon or suggest that control of the money supply or interest rates is the key remedy for inflation, unlike neoclassical theory.

Lastly, Keynes&#x27; economic theory was criticized by Marxian economists, who said that Keynes ideas, while well intentioned, cannot work in the long run due to the contradictions in capitalism. A couple of these contradictions to which Marxians point are the idea of full employment, which is seen as impossible under private capitalism; and the idea that government can encourage capital investment through government spending, when in reality government spending could be a net loss on profits.

===Introductions===
The earliest attempt to write a student guide was Robinson (1937) and the most successful (by numbers sold) was Hansen (1953). These are both quite accessible but adhere to the Old Keynesian school of the time. An up-to-date post-Keynesian attempt, aimed mainly at graduate and advanced undergraduate students, is Hayes (2006), and an easier version is Sheehan (2009). Paul Krugman has written an introduction to the 2007 Palgrave Macmillan edition of &quot;The General Theory&quot;.

<text>A trial balloon, or kite-flying (used in the UK and elsewhere), is information sent out to the media in order to observe the reaction of an audience. It is used by companies sending out press releases to judge customer reaction, and by politicians who deliberately leak information on a policy change. The term is of French origin. Trial balloon translates French &quot;ballon d&#x27;essai&quot;, which was a small balloon sent up immediately before a manned ascent to determine the direction and tendency of winds. Its earliest use in English is figurative.

For example, a company might announce a new computer program to be delivered in a year, and then read the press coverage for hints on whether or not the product will have market appeal. If the coverage is favourable the money is spent on development, but if not the project can be cancelled before consuming resources. A trial balloon under the company&#x27;s own name is somewhat risky; if too many are &quot;floated&quot; the company risks becoming known as unserious, and its announcements are ignored. In addition, the company can find that the planned product is unworkable, leading to the phenomenon of vaporware.

==United States==
In politics, trial balloons often take the form of an intentional news &quot;leak&quot;. An example was when &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in mid-June 2012 that Governor Andrew Cuomo and his staff were deliberating on a plan to restrict hydrofracking to five counties in the Southern Tier of New York where the Marcellus shale is deepest and drilling is least likely to pollute well water supplies in those aquifers. Because the proposed change in New York energy law was controversial, the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; the next day published a front-page, above-the-fold story questioning the plan&#x27;s leak as a &quot;trial balloon&quot; in the headline, which quickly garnered criticism and support.

In American slang, the phrase &quot;run it up the flagpole and see who salutes&quot; (i.e., to raise an issue and see the reaction) is a form of trial balloon.

==United Kingdom==
An early British example came in 1885 when Herbert Gladstone, son of Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone, wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; stating support for Irish Home Rule. This was dubbed the Hawarden Kite after Hawarden Castle, the Gladstone family home. Historians are uncertain whether this was co-ordinated between the Gladstones, but the reaction was sufficiently sympathetic that Gladstone publicly committed himself and his party to the policy.

==Ireland==
Minister for Justice Brian Lenihan suggested in the 1960s that Ireland join the Commonwealth of Nations. He did so on the instructions of the Taoiseach, Seán Lemass. However, the Irish and general reaction was hostile, and Lemass and Lenihan both agreed to abandon the idea, claiming that Lenihan had been speaking theoretically in a personal capacity and not for his government.

<text>A surplice (; Late Latin &quot;superpelliceum&quot;, from &quot;super&quot;, &quot;over&quot; and &quot;pellicia&quot;, &quot;fur garment&quot;) is a liturgical vestment of Western Christianity. The surplice is in the form of a tunic of white linen or cotton fabric, reaching to the knees, with wide or moderately wide sleeves.

It was originally a long garment with open sleeves reaching nearly to the ground. As it remains in the Western Christian traditions, the surplice often has shorter, closed sleeves and square shoulders. Anglicans typically refer to a Roman-style surplice with the Medieval Latin term &quot;cotta&quot; (meaning &quot;cut-off&#x27; in Italian), as it is derived from the cut-off alb. English-speaking Catholics typically do not make the distinction between the two styles and refer to both as a &quot;surplice&quot;.

== Origin and variation ==
It seems most probable that the surplice first appeared in France or England, from whence its use gradually spread to Italy [citation needed]. It is possible that there is a connection between the surplice and the Gallican or Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite, which was superseded during the Carolingian era by the Roman Rite. The founding of the Augustinian Canons in the second half of the eleventh century may have had a special influence upon the spread of the surplice. Among the Augustinian Canons the surplice was not only the choir vestment, but also a part of the habit of the order.

The surplice originally reached to the feet, but as early as the 13th century it began to shorten, though as late as the 15th century it still fell to the middle of the shin, and only in the 17th and 18th centuries in Continental Europe did it become considerably shorter. In several localities it underwent more drastic modifications in the course of time, which led to the appearance of various subsidiary forms alongside the original type. For example:
* the sleeveless surplice, which featured holes at the sides to put the arms through
* the surplice with slit arms or lappets (so-called &quot;wings&quot;) instead of sleeves, often worn by organists today, due to the ease of maneuvering the arms
* the surplice with not only the sleeves but the body of the garment itself slit up the sides, precisely like the modern dalmatic
* a sort of surplice in the form of a bell-shaped mantle, with a hole for the head, which necessitated the arms sticking out under the hem.

The first two of these forms developed very early; and, in spite of their prohibition by synods here and there (for example that of Liège &quot;circa&quot; 1287), they survive in various places to the present day. The latter two only appeared after the close of the Middle Ages: the first of them in South Germany, the second more especially in Venetia, where numerous pictorial records attest its use. As a rule, however, only the lower clergy wore these subsidiary forms of surplice. They came about partly under the influence of secular fashions, but more particularly for convenience.

Lack of exact information obscures the older history of the surplice. Its name derives, as Durandus and Gerland also affirm, from the fact that its wearers formerly put it on over the fur garments formerly worn in church during divine service as a protection against the cold. The word derived its name from the Medieval Latin word &quot;superpellicium&quot; which divides into&quot; super&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, and &quot;pellicia&quot;, &quot;fur garment&quot;.

Some scholars trace the use of the surplice at least as far back as the 5th century, citing the evidence of the garments worn by the two clerics in attendance on Bishop Maximian represented in the mosaics of the Basilica of San Vitale at Ravenna; in this case, however, confusing the dalmatic with the surplice.

In all probability the surplice forms no more than an expansion of the ordinary liturgical alb, due to the necessity for wearing it over thick furs. The first documents to mention the surplice date from the 11th century: a canon of the Synod of Coyaca in Spain (1050); and an ordinance of King Edward the Confessor. Rome knew the surplice at least as early as the 12th century. It probably originated outside Rome, and was imported thence into the Roman use. Originally only a choir vestment and peculiar to the lower clergy, it gradually—certainly no later than the 13th century—replaced the alb as the vestment proper to the administering of the sacraments and other sacerdotal functions.

The Eastern Churches do not use a surplice or any analogous vestment. Of the non-Roman Catholic Churches in the West the surplice has continued in regular use in the Lutheran churches, in the Anglican Communion, and among various Old Catholic denominations among others.

==Roman Catholicism==

In the Roman tradition, the surplice (or &quot;cotta&quot;) sometimes features liturgical lace decoration or embroidered bordures.

The surplice is meant to be a miniature alb, the alb itself being the symbol of the white garment received at Baptism. As such, it is appropriately worn by any cleric, by lectors and acolytes, or indeed by altar servers who are technically standing in for instituted acolytes for any liturgical service. It is often worn, for instance, by seminarians when attending Mass and by non-clerical choirs. It is usually worn over a cassock and never alone, nor is it ever gathered by a belt or cincture.

It may be worn under a stole by deacons and priests for liturgical ceremonies or the celebration of sacraments outside of Mass. On occasion, a cope is worn over the cassock, surplice and stole.

As part of the choir dress of the clergy, it is normally not worn by prelates (the pope, cardinals, bishops, monsignori, and some canons)—instead, these clerics wear the rochet, which is in fact a variant of the surplice.

The surplice belongs to the &quot;vestes sacrae&quot; (sacred vestments), though it requires no benediction before it is worn.

==Anglicanism==

The second Anglican Prayer Book, that of Edward VI in 1552, prescribed the surplice as, with the tippet or the academic hood, the sole vestment of the minister of the church at &quot;all times of their ministration&quot;, the rochet being practically regarded as the episcopal surplice. The more extreme Reformers furiously assailed its use, but in spite of their efforts, Elizabeth&#x27;s Act of Uniformity 1558 retained the garment, and the advertisements and injunctions issued under her authority enforced its use, though they ordered the destruction of the &quot;massing vestments&quot;—chasubles, albs, stoles and the like. Copes survived this destruction as they were not considered &quot;superstitious,&quot; having no explicit symbolic formula like the other vestments.

Until 1965, the surplice had remained, with the exception of the cope, the sole vestment authorised by law for the ministers, other than bishops, of the Church of England (for the question of the vestments prescribed by the &quot;Ornaments Rubric&quot; see vestment). And apart from clerks in Holy Orders, all the &quot;ministers&quot; (including vicars-choral and choristers) of cathedral and collegiate churches, as well as the fellows and scholars of colleges in chapel have worn surplices since the Reformation.

The clergy have employed as a distinctive mark the tippet or scarf mentioned above, a broad band of black stuff or silk worn stole-wise, but not to be confused with the stole, since it has no liturgical significance and originally formed a mere part of the clerical outdoor dress for high ranking or degree-holding clerics. Formerly the clergy only wore the surplice when conducting the service, and exchanged it during the sermon for the &quot;black gown&quot;, i.e. either a Geneva gown or the gown of an academic degree. This custom has, however, as a result of the High Church movement, become almost completely obsolete. The &quot;black gown&quot;, considered wrongly as the ensign of Low Church views, survives in comparatively few even of evangelical churches; however, preachers of university sermons retained the custom of wearing the gown of their degree.
The traditional form of the surplice in the Church of England survived from pre-Reformation times: a wide-sleeved, very full, plain, white linen tunic, pleated from the yoke, and reaching almost, or quite, to the feet. Towards the end of the 17th century, when large wigs came into fashion, it became convenient to have surplices constructed gown-wise, open down the front and buttoned at the neck, a fashion which still partially survives, notably at the universities. In general, however, the tendency followed continental influence, and curtailed the surplice&#x27;s proportions. The ample vestment with falling folds has thus in many churches given place to an unpleated garment reaching to the knee. In some Anglo-Catholic churches, the surplices follow the style of the Roman cotta. Cottas may in some churches be worn by servers and members of the choir and clergy may wear surplices in services where they do not wear eucharistic vestments.

==Lutheranism==
Traditionally, the surplice is used for non-sacramental services, worn over the cassock, such as morning prayer, Vespers, and Compline without Eucharist. The surplice is traditionally full-length in the arm and hangs at least down to the knee.

In German Lutheran and United Churches, where the black academic gown with preaching bands have commonly been in use since the early 19th century, the surplice is sometimes worn over the academic gown and preaching bands as a &#x27;compromise&#x27; between the black gown, which has become a symbol of Protestantism among Germans, and the traditional Christian symbol of white for grace and the sacrament.

==Paleo-orthodox and emerging church movements==
Among the paleo-orthodoxy and emerging church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, particularly Methodist, Lutheran, and Presbyterian, many clergy are reclaiming not only the traditional Eucharist vestments of alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style) with appropriate liturgical stole, and cassock and Geneva gown for a Liturgy or Service of the Word.

<text>The Dodge Caravan is a series of minivans manufactured by Chrysler from the 1984 through 2020 model years. The Dodge version of the Chrysler minivans, was marketed as both a passenger van and a cargo van (the only version of the model line offered in the latter configuration). For 1987, the model line was joined by the long-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan. Produced in five generations across 36 model years, the Dodge Caravan is the second longest-lived Dodge nameplate (exceeded only by the Dodge Charger). Initially marketed as the Dodge counterpart of the Plymouth Voyager, the Caravan was later slotted between the Voyager and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country. Following the demise of Plymouth, the model line became the lowest-price Chrysler minivan, ultimately slotted below the Chrysler Pacifica. 

Sold primarily in the United States and Canada, the Dodge Caravan was also marketed in Europe and other international markets under the Chrysler brand (as the Chrysler Voyager or Chrysler Caravan). From 2008 onward, Dodge marketed the model line only as the Grand Caravan; Ram Trucks sold a cargo-only version of the model line as the Ram C/V Tradesman. The model line was also rebranded as the Volkswagen Routan from 2009 through 2014.

After the 2020 model year, the Dodge Grand Caravan was discontinued, ending production on August 21, 2020. For 2021 production, the Grand Caravan nameplate was moved to Chrysler, which used it for a Canadian-market version of the Chrysler Pacifica (in the United States, the exact vehicle was marketed as the Chrysler Voyager). 

For its entire production run, the Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan was manufactured by Chrysler Canada (now Stellantis Canada) at its Windsor Assembly facility (Windsor, Ontario). From 1987 until 2007, the model line was also manufactured by Chrysler at its Saint Louis Assembly facility (Fenton, Missouri). Since their introduction in late 1983, over 14.6 million Chrysler minivans have been sold worldwide (including export versions and versions sold through rebranding).

== Background ==
At the end of 1977, Chrysler commenced development on what would become the Chrysler minivans. Alongside the ability to park within a standard-height garage, designers sought to develop a vehicle with a low floor and car-like NVH levels. While front-wheel drive was sought out for the design, rear-wheel drive was still considered an alternative for cost reasons. Following the move of both Hal Sperlich and Lee Iacocca from Ford to Chrysler in late 1978, the Chrysler minivan design (codenamed T-115 at the time) adopted front-wheel drive.

While the Dodge Caravan (and Plymouth Voyager) shared no chassis underpinnings with the K-cars, the two model lines retained mechanical commonality, sharing engines and transmissions.
== First generation (1984–1990) ==

Initially slated for introduction as a 1982 model, the Dodge Caravan was introduced alongside the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year.

Interior trim, controls, and instrumentation were borrowed from the Chrysler K platform, and with the lower floor made possible by the front-wheel-drive platform, the Caravan featured car-like ease of entry. Three trim levels were available: base, SE, and LE. The Caravan, along with the Plymouth Voyager, are considered to be the first mass-produced vehicles to have dedicated built-in cup holders.

Base models came equipped for five passengers in two rows of seating. The LE came with seven passengers standard in three rows of seating. The base van had two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front and a three-person bench seat in the second row. The seven-passenger included two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front, a two-person bench seat in the second row, and a three-person bench seat in the back row. The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable, and the large three-person bench could also be installed in the second-row location via a second set of attachment points on the van&#x27;s floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers. This configuration allowed for conventional five-person seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear. The latching mechanisms for the benches were easy to operate, although removing and replacing the seats typically required two adults. A front low-back 60/40 split-bench, accommodating a third front passenger in the middle, was offered exclusively in the SE trim level for 1985, allowing for a maximum of eight passengers. This configuration was subsequently discontinued. The base model&#x27;s curb weight was .

Safety features included three-point seat belts for the front two passengers and lap belts for the rear five. The seats on base models and cloth-trimmed SEs had no headrests due to the vehicle&#x27;s &quot;light truck&quot; classification rather than following standard passenger car safety standards. However, the two front seats included non-adjustable headrests on the LE model and in conjunction with vinyl upholstery on the SE versions. Safety standards mandated side-impact reinforcements at all seating positions, front and rear.

Access to the rear rows of seating was by a large passenger-side sliding door, enabling easy access in confined situations, e.g., parking. Because only one sliding door was offered, the smaller second-row bench seat was shifted to the driver&#x27;s side of the van, facilitating passenger access to the third-row seat. To facilitate variable cargo storage behind the third-row rear seat, the seat could be adjusted forward in two increments, the first of which reduced legroom for the back row passengers by about , and the second of which would push the bench to the back of the second row, making the seats unusable. The seatback of the rear bench could also be folded forward, providing a flat cargo shelf. The narrower second-row bench was neither adjustable nor foldable; it could only be removed entirely.

Cargo access to the rear was via a hatchback, similar to the one on the K platform station wagons. The hatch was hinged at the top and held open by gas struts.

A long-wheelbase variant, marketed as the Grand Caravan, was introduced in May 1987. It offered more cargo space behind the third-row seat.

A commercial cargo version of the Caravan, called the Mini Ram Van, was also introduced for 1984, with a flat-floored cargo space offering a four-foot interior height and featuring four feet of space between the rear wheel wells. The load capacity was . It was renamed the Caravan C/V for 1989 and was discontinued after 1995. It was initially available with a short wheelbase; a long-wheelbase variant was introduced alongside the Grand Caravan.

Unique to the Caravan C/V was a traditional hatch door in the back or the optional swing-out bi-parting doors (with or without windows), similar to those of more traditional cargo vans. These doors were made of fiberglass. Also based on the Mini Ram and C/V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves.

=== Trim levels ===
*&quot;Base&quot; – Included: Vinyl upholstery, 5-passenger seating, warning chimes, cigar lighter, digital clock, manual locks, windows and mirrors, 15-gallon fuel tank, tinted windows, halogen headlamps, an AM/FM stereo with four speakers, vinyl steering wheel, and intermittent wipers.
*&quot;SE&quot; – Added: Cloth upholstery, reclining front seats, rear assist strap, 20-gallon fuel tank, power liftgate release, tape stripes, and steel road wheels.
*&quot;LE&quot; – Added: Cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, front and rear fascia, forward storage console, warning lights for door ajar, storage drawer, washer fluid warning, and power mirrors.

=== Transmissions ===
Both a 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission and a 5-speed manual were available with all straight-four engines, including the turbocharged 2.5-liter (this was a rare combination). The Plymouth Voyager, which was a rebadged version of the Caravan, was also available with a manual transmission. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country, released in 1990, was a more luxurious repackaged version of the Caravan and had no manual transmission option. Manual transmissions were not available on V6 models of the passenger Caravan, but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V&#x27;s long-wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6.

The V6 engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite, until the computer-controlled Ultradrive 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The Ultradrive offered better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the inline-four engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as &quot;gear hunt&quot; or &quot;shift busyness&quot;, resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common Dexron II rather than the specified &quot;Mopar ATF+3&quot;, resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure. Early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers under warranty.

=== Engines ===
For the first three years of production, two engines were offered in the Caravan – both straight-four engines with 2-barrel carburetors. The base 2.2 L was borrowed from the Chrysler K-cars, and produced horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the 2.2 L engine later offered in the K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the 2.2 L, an optional Mitsubishi 2.6 L engine was available, producing horsepower.

In mid-1987, the base 2.2 L I4 was replaced with a fuel-injected 2.5 L I4, which produced , while the Mitsubishi &quot;G54B&quot; I4 was replaced with the new fuel-injected 3.0 L Mitsubishi V6 producing in March of that year.

Shortly thereafter in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional, with a turbocharged version of the base 2.5 L producing . Revisions to the Mitsubishi V6 upped its output to that same year, and in 1990 a new 3.3 L V6 was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 L turbo dwindled and it was dropped at the end of the year. In these years, the ES model debuted (short-wheelbase only) to highlight the new engines, the turbo 2.5 L in particular. The ES was introduced to the long-wheelbase Grand Caravan for 1991 and continued throughout 2003 before it was discontinued and replaced with the SXT.

* 1984–1987 2.2 L &quot;K&quot; I4, , 
* 1984–1987 2.6 L Mitsubishi &quot;G54B&quot; I4, , 
* 1987½–1990 2.5 L &quot;K&quot; I4, , 
* 1987½–1988 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6, , 
* 1989–1990 2.5 L &quot;K&quot; Turbo I4, , 
* 1989–1990 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6, , 
* 1990 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 

== Second generation (1991–1995) ==
For the 1991 model year, the second-generation Dodge Caravan was released. Intended as an extensive revision of the first generation, while the chassis underpinnings were carried over and updated, the only shared body panels were the front doors and the sliding door. To match the Ford Aerostar and General Motors APV minivans, designers sought to improve the exterior aerodynamics and the handling of the model line. To enhance safety, anti-lock brakes and all-wheel drive were introduced as options; as a first in the segment, a driver-side airbag became an option in 1991 (a first in the segment).

The model line again came in two lengths, with the long-wheelbase Grand Caravan making its return; the C/V cargo van also was part of the model line. The Caravan was further distinguished from the Voyager; along with different grilles and headlamp units, the Caravan received less chrome trim (limited to the grille and the Chrysler Pentastar hood ornament). Shedding its connection to the K-cars, the Caravan received a unique dashboard design (though shared with the Voyager, the Caravan received a new steering wheel design). On all but the base-trim Caravan, the seven-passenger trim was standard. In addition to the two rear bench seats, the second generation introduced the option of middle-row bucket seats; in 1992, Chrysler introduced integrated child safety seats, an innovation in the segment.

For the 1994 model year, the Caravan underwent a mid-cycle revision as part of a body upgrade to meet 1998 federal safety standards. Though the exterior saw only minor changes to the bumpers and lower body side trim, the interior underwent larger changes, receiving new seats and door panels. Coinciding with the addition of a passenger-side airbag, the dashboard was redesigned. Following its declining popularity, the woodgrain trim option was discontinued in favor of monochromatic and two-tone exterior designs.

To commemorate the tenth year of production, Dodge offered the &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot; option package for 1994. Available on SE/LE trims of the Caravan and Grand Caravan, the 10th Anniversary Edition was an appearance package, combining a two-tone exterior (a light-gray lower body with selected upper body colors) with a gold front fender badge.

=== Trim levels ===
*&quot;Base&quot; – Included: cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, intermediate bench seat, tinted manual windows, power mirrors, intermittent windshield wipers and a rear wiper, glove box, and an AM/FM stereo.
*&quot;SE&quot; – Added: power liftgate release, reclining front seats, and a rear bench seat.
*&quot;LE&quot; – Added: heated mirrors, forward storage console, tachometer, oil pressure, and voltage gauges, an overhead console, power locks, rear defroster, speed control, storage drawer under the front passenger seat, and a tilt steering column.

=== Engines ===
Except for the discontinued 150 hp 2.5 L turbocharged I4, the second-generation Caravan carried over its powertrain line from the 1990 Dodge Caravan. Shifting its powertrain commonality from the Dodge Aries to that of the larger Dodge Dynasty, a 2.5 L I4 was the standard engine, with a 3.0 L V6 and 3.3 L V6 as options. In 1994, the Caravan received a 3.8 L V6 (shared with the Chrysler Imperial/Fifth Avenue) as an option.

* 1991–1995 2.5 L &quot;EDM (K)&quot; I4, , 
* 1991–1995 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6, , 
* 1991–1993 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 
* 1994–1995 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 
* 1994–1995 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 

=== Integrated child safety seats ===
In 1991, Dodge introduced a second-row bench seat integrating two child booster seats on 1992 models. These seats continued as an available option through Generation V until they were discontinued in 2010.

== Third generation (1996–2000) ==

The third-generation Chrysler minivans were available in long- and short–wheelbase models; three- and four-door configurations; and eight different powertrains, including electric and compressed natural gas; on a single, flexible platform.

In development for nearly 5 years from early 1990 (full development from 1991) to December 26, 1994 (final design by Don Renkert was approved on September 23, 1991, and frozen in May 1992), the 1996 model was introduced at the 1995 North American International Auto Show using the Chrysler S platform. It included a number of innovations, including a driver&#x27;s side sliding door (optional initially, to become standard equipment later), a first for Chrysler and a non-compact minivan for the United States and Canada. With Generation III, Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as &quot;Easy Out Roller Seats&quot;. A conventional door handle and lock were added to the rear hatch, eliminating the confusing pop-and-lift maneuver that had been required on earlier models.

Base models of the Caravan were offered in most states with either a 2.4 L four-cylinder or the 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6 engine, except in several northeastern states, where the Mitsubishi did not meet emissions standards. In those areas, the 3.3 L engine was offered as the V6 option from 1997 through 2000.

The 1996 Caravan, along with the Plymouth Voyager and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country won the North American Car of the Year award. The Caravan itself won &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year 1996 and appeared on the Car and Driver Ten Best for 1996 and 1997. 1999 also saw the addition of a one-year-only 15th anniversary &quot;Platinum Edition&quot;, to mark Caravan&#x27;s 15th year of production. This package was offered on various trim levels and included Platinum Metallic paint as well as fender badges. The 2000 model year offered packages that included the &quot;2000+&quot; and &quot;Millennium&quot; packages; however, these were little more than unique fender badges on the vans with popular equipment.

During the 1996 model year, running changes saw the elimination of the plastic intake manifold cover from the 3.8L engine and redesigned interior door panels. Changes for the 1997 model year were minor, adding traction control as an option or standard equipment, depending on trim level, along with the reintroduction of optional all-wheel drive. The Caravan received more minor updates in 1997 for the 1998 model year. These changes came in the form of new colors, new wheels for trims above SE, new interior fabric, optional heated seats, and automatic headlights on higher trim levels. In the calendar year 1998, the Caravan&#x27;s HVAC vents on the driver&#x27;s side and center of the dashboard were updated to have a more conventional design. Later that year, the 1999 Caravan received new front styling on all trims above SE, while the Sport and ES models received even sportier styling. The ES model was the first minivan to receive the &quot;AutoStick&quot; transmission and 17-inch wheels. A cargo net between the driver and front passenger seats was added. Color-keyed door and lift-gate handles were made standard on SE models, in addition to a new keyless entry remote. Base and SE models had options for a spoiler as well as color-keyed bumpers and trim (grey or color-molded bumpers and trim were standard). The driver&#x27;s side sliding door became standard. Chrysler had updates of the Plymouth Voyager in 1996 for the 1997 model year and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country in 1997 for the 1998 model year, before the 1998–2007 DaimlerChrysler era; it was the only exterior update of the NS Dodge Caravan.

=== Trim levels ===
*&quot;Base&quot; – Included: Cloth upholstery, speed-sensitive wipers, manual locks, 14-inch steel road wheels with &quot;Successor&quot; hubcaps, and an AM/FM stereo with four speakers. Package 22T added air conditioning and a cargo net.
*&quot;SE&quot; – Added: air conditioning, power mirrors, speed control, rear defroster, power locks, sliding rear driver&#x27;s side door, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and four speakers, steering wheel audio controls, and 15-inch steel road wheels with &quot;revolver&quot; hubcaps. Package 28D added power front windows with automatic driver&#x27;s side window, ignition delay, glove box, and an ashtray.
*&quot;Sport&quot; – Added: tinted windows, and power windows with automatic driver&#x27;s side window, fog lamps, and 16-inch steel road wheels with &quot;Vortex&quot; hubcaps.
*&quot;LE&quot; – Added: optional leather seating surfaces, dual-zone air conditioning with temp control, overhead console with sunglass holder, garage door opener holder, illuminated entry, headlamp off delay, keyless entry, security alarm, power driver&#x27;s seat, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player, steering wheel audio controls, graphic equalizer, Infinity 200-watt sound system and 10 speakers, center console storage bin, and 15-inch steel road wheels with &quot;Citadel&quot; hubcaps.
*&quot;ES&quot; – Added: leather seating surfaces, fog lamps, automatic headlamps, garage door opener, heated power front seats, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players, rear spoiler, and 16-inch &quot;genesis&quot; alloy road wheels.

=== Engines ===
* 1996–2000 2.4 L &quot;EDZ&quot; I4, , (Canadian vans beginning in 1999 included a 3.0 L V6 as standard equipment)
* 1996–2000 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6 , (not available in certain U.S. states, 3.3 L V6 offered as standard equipment in those states instead)
* 1996–2000 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 
* 1996–1997 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 
* 1998–2000 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 

=== Dodge Caravan EPIC ===

In 1999, Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC, a fully electric minivan. The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to on a single charge. The EPIC was a fleet-only lease vehicle. Production of the EPIC was discontinued in 2001. Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced. After the leases expired they were returned and crushed. Approximately ten vans remain in private hands today.

=== Crash test results ===
The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a &quot;Marginal&quot; rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s 40 mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded &quot;Acceptable&quot;, but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

=== Concepts ===
Other plans for this generation included three minivan concepts to be made in the Windsor Assembly, the Dodge Caravan R/T, Voyager XG, and the Chrysler Pacifica 1999 concept. The Caravan R/T (originally ESS) was to include the most powerful engine ever for a minivan, rated at . It had large air intakes and driving lights in the front bumper, a brushed aluminum instrument panel, racing-style pedals, and black and white rubber flooring. The Voyager XG was more rugged, featured a diesel engine and manual transmission, and included many outdoor amenities, such as a built-in ice pack. The Chrysler Pacifica, based on the Town &amp; Country, was more luxurious, had power leather seats and footrests, overhead bins, lighting, an LHS grille, and roof-long skylights. The Pacifica was not introduced in 2004, based on the fifth-generation Caravan, except that it became a crossover SUV rather than a minivan; the nameplate was eventually applied to a minivan in 2016.

=== Easy-Out Roller Seats ===
In 1995, Dodge introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning, marketed as &quot;Easy-Out Roller Seats&quot;. When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, to simplify installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks release the floor latches single-handedly, without tools, and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

When configured as two and three-person benches (available through Generation IV), the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy. Beginning in 2000, second and third-row seats became available in a &#x27;quad&#x27; configuration – bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third-row three-person 50/50 split &quot;bench&quot; – with each section weighing under . The Easy-out system remained in use through Generation V – where certain models featured a two-person bench &quot;and&quot; the under-floor compartments from the &quot;Stow&#x27;n Go&quot; system.

All the rebadged nameplate variants of the Chrysler minivans use the Easy Out Roller Seats on their second-row seating, whereas not the Stow and Go system.

== Fourth generation (2001–2007) ==

Unveiled at the 2000 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) on Monday, January 10, 2000, the redesigned 2001 Dodge Caravan and 2001 Chrysler Town &amp; Country were released for sale in August 2000. The release was part of a promotional tie-in with Nabisco, which unveiled their new &quot;Mini Oreos&quot; inside the van during the unveiling. The first vans rolled off the line at the Windsor Assembly Plant on July 24. The fourth generation vans were available in the trim levels; &quot;SE&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;SXT&quot;, &quot;AWD Sports&quot;, &quot;base&quot; model, &quot;AWD Choice&quot;, &quot;eL&quot;, &quot;C/V&quot;, &quot;ES&quot;, &quot;EX&quot;, &quot;AWD Wagon&quot;, and &quot;SXT All-Wheel-Drive&quot;.

In development from February 1996 to December 1999, the Generation IV minivans were based on the Chrysler RS platform and featured a larger body frame with modified headlights and taillights. Design work was done by Brandon Faurote in January 1997 and reached production approval in 1998.

In addition to other detailed changes, power sliding doors and a power hatch became available as options. The Mitsubishi 3.0 L V6, which no longer met emissions standards in California and the northeastern U.S., was discontinued, and a more powerful 3.8 L engine, based on the 3.3 L, became available. All All-wheel drive continued to be offered on high-end models. Other innovative available features included remote-operated sliding doors and a rear hatch, which could be opened and closed at the push of a button, either inside the vehicle or with the keyless entry fob.

In the 2002 model year, DaimlerChrysler stopped using the &quot;DODGE&quot; badges on the front doors, like with all Dodge vehicles.

In 2003, the Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V returned after having been discontinued in 1995. The C/V featured the option of deleted side windows (replaced by composite panels), optional rear seats, a cargo floor made of plastic material similar to pickup truck bed liners, rubber flooring in place of carpeting, and a normal hatch at the rear. Minor changes were made to the Grand Caravan ES including many of the features included in Option Group 29S becoming standard, the 17-inch Titan chrome wheels no longer being an option replaced with standard 16-inch chrome wheels, and the disappearance of the AutoStick Transmission option. This year also saw the appearance of an optional factory-installed rear-seat DVD system with a single-disc player mounted below the HVAC controls.

The 2004 model year offered an exclusive one-year-only &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; package to mark Caravan&#x27;s 20th year in production. This package was offered on higher-level SXT models and included chrome wheels, body-color moldings, special interior accents, as well as a unique fender badge.

The 2005 model year came very early, starting production in January 2004. Changes for 2005 included a revised grille, new foglight fascia, and a system of in-floor folding second and third-row seats, marketed as &quot;Stow &#x27;n Go seating&quot;.

Production of this generation continued in China from 2008, when the Taiwanese Chrysler Town &amp; Country production line was relocated there, until late 2010 when the fifth generation Chrysler Voyager was introduced to the Chinese market. The Caravan was subsequently replaced by the Journey, although a page for the Caravan still exists on the Dodge China site. The Chinese Caravan was produced alongside the Town &amp; Country, now using the Grand Voyager nameplate, by Soueast, and did not share any aesthetic components with the North American Caravan aside from the wheels. Instead, the Chinese Caravan was identical to the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country, aside from the lack of chrome trim on the exterior door panels, and used a modified version of the Town &amp; Country front bumper with a Dodge grille. Chinese vans were equipped with Mitsubishi 6G72 engines and came in three trim levels: Classic, SXT, and Luxury.

=== IIHS results ===
The 2001 model of this version earned a &quot;Poor&quot; rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s 40 mph offset test. It did protect its occupants reasonably well, and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, a fuel leak occurred. Chrysler corrected this problem starting with the 2002 models, moving it up to an &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating.

The 2006 model year brought optional side curtain airbags and a stronger B-pillar, which was tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s side-impact crash test. With the side airbags, it got an &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating. For the driver, there is a chance of serious neck injuries, rib fractures, and/or internal organ injuries. The rear passengers, however, could leave this accident unharmed, as there is a low risk of significant injury in a crash of this severity for them.

=== Stow &#x27;N Go seating ===
In 2004, Dodge introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. It was marketed as &quot;Stow &#x27;N Go&quot; and was available exclusively on long-wheelbase models.

In a development program costing $400 million, engineers initially used an Erector Set to visualize the complex interaction of the design and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and rear suspension but precluded all-wheel drive (AWD).

The system, in turn, creates a combined volume of of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat-load floor and a maximum cargo volume of .

The Stow &#x27;n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best of What&#x27;s New&quot; for 2005 award, and was never offered on the Volkswagen Routan, the rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans.

For the model year 2011, Chrysler revised the system, rebranding it as &quot;Super Stow &#x27;n Go&quot;. New pivoting head restraints with taller seatbacks and a revised folding mechanism (marketed as &quot;single action&quot;) improved stowage ease – with the head restraints folding on themselves automatically and the entire seat automatically folding down to a position just over its floor recess.

== Fifth generation (2008–2020) ==

The fifth-generation Dodge minivan debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show with exterior styling by Ralph Gilles. Beginning with Generation V in the model year 2008, Chrysler only made the long-wheelbase Grand Caravan. With the discontinuation of the short-wheelbase Caravan, Dodge offered the Journey on nearly an identical wheelbase and as a crossover rather than a minivan. Although the SWB model, which had accounted for half of all sales in Canada, cost approximately $2,000 less and offered a four-cylinder engine option with improved fuel economy, Chrysler executives stated the SWB Caravan was discontinued to accommodate new features offered in the Grand Caravan, consistent with the demands of the majority of the minivan market.

A new six-speed automatic transmission became standard with the 3.8 L V6 and the new 4.0 L V6. The four-speed automatic transmission is standard with the 3.3 L Flex-Fuel V6. This generation of Grand Caravan and its Town &amp; Country counterpart were not available with an all-wheel-drive system. The previously unavailable Electronic Stability Control was made standard on this generation.

Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as &quot;Swivel&#x27;n Go&quot; seating, the MyGIG entertainment system (a stereo with a built-in hard drive for recording, storing, and playing music), second and third-row video screens, powered second-row windows, standard side curtain airbags, and dashboard-mounted transmission controls. The gear shift lever moved to the instrument panel, the location used by competitors.

The market shifted briefly away from minivans and SUVs with the gasoline price spikes of the earlier part of 2008. This trend began to reverse itself in the fall of 2008. During 2009 and 2010 the Dodge Grand Caravan continued to be the top-selling minivan in Canada, with over 60% of the market&#x27;s monthly sales.

&quot;Automotive News&quot; reported that from January to October 2010, Dodge sold about a third of its 2010 Grand Caravans to rental fleets. The relatively high rental fleet sales depressed used vehicles&#x27; resale value: as the number of returned ex-rental 2010 Grand Caravan to the market jumped fourfold between July and October, prices of used 2009 and 2010 Dodge minivans dropped by as much as 20%.

The Dodge Grand Caravan was discontinued after the 2020 model year because of &quot;regulatory reasons&quot;. It was reported that the cost of updating the vehicle to meet new federal safety regulations is so high that it would eliminate its low price advantage.

=== Trim levels ===
*&quot;SE&quot; – Included: Cloth upholstery, 16-inch steel wheels with hubcaps, overhead console with observation mirror, sunglass bin (not available if equipped with sunroof), power locks, power windows with automatic driver&#x27;s side window, sliding door alert system (hazards flash for 10 seconds when opened), manual sliding doors, manual mirrors, air conditioning (manual temperature control), floor console, and an AM/FM stereo with a single-CD player, MP3 capability, auxiliary input jack and four speakers.
*&quot;SXT&quot; Added: power sliding doors, power heated mirrors, automatic front windows, power second-row windows, rear power vents, a rear overhead console, universal garage door opener, LED lighting with rear overhead swivel lamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, power driver&#x27;s seat, Stow N Go, an AM/FM stereo with single-CD/DVD player with MP3 capability, 20 GB HDD, backup camera and 6 speakers, and 16-inch alloy road wheels.
*&quot;SXT Premium&quot; Added: Chromed exterior mirrors and chrome-striped side molding, 17-inch alloy road wheels, power sunroof

=== Engines ===

Both the 3.8 L and 4.0 L engines were paired with Chrysler&#x27;s 62TE 6-speed automatic transmission with variable line pressure (VLP) technology (See Ultradrive#62TE).

In Canada (2008–2010) the 3.3 L was the standard engine across the range, combined with the 4-speed 41TE automatic transmission. The 4.0 L engine and the six-speed combination was available as an option on only the top-of-the-range SXT models. In 2011 the six-speed transmission was specified as standard on the Town &amp; Country.

=== Swivel &#x27;n Go seating ===
Dodge introduced a seating system for 2008, marketed as &quot;Swivel &#x27;n Go&quot;. In the seating system, two full-size second row seats swivel to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third-row seats. The Swivel &#x27;n Go seating system includes the third-row seating from the Stow &#x27;n Go system. The system is offered on the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country, but not the Volkswagen Routan, a rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans.

These Swivel &#x27;n Go Seats are manufactured by Intier, a division of Magna. The tracks, risers, and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by Toyo Seat. The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation. The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage the swivel mechanism.

The &quot;Swivel &#x27;n Go&quot; feature was discontinued after the 2010 model year.

=== Model history ===

==== 2009 model year ====
For 2009, standard Stow &#x27;n Go seats were added that folded flat into the rear area floor to create more cargo room, while the Swivel &#x27;n Go seats turned 180 degrees to face the third row. The available SXT trim now included new technology options. New for 2009 was an optional &quot;sport&quot; suspension system as well as a blind-spot warning system and &quot;Cross Path Detection&quot; with sensors to warn of cars or other obstacles when backing out of a parking space.

==== 2010 model year ====
The Chrysler minivans became the only domestic brand minivans as GM and Ford replaced their slow-selling models with three-row crossover SUVs.

Changes for the 2010 Dodge Grand Caravans included new active head restraints for the driver and front passenger on all models, three-zone manual climate controls for the Grand Caravan SE, and a new 3.16 final drive ratio for models equipped with the 4.0-liter engine.

==== 2011 model year ====

The Grand Caravan underwent a mid-cycle refresh for the 2011 model year, which included major changes in both styling and functionality. The suspension was heavily re-tuned, with both Dodge and Chrysler minivans gaining a larger front sway bar and new rear sway bar, increased rear roll center height, adjusted spring rates, a new steering gear, a revised front static camber setting, and lowered ride height. This improved handling.

All three of the former engine choices were replaced by the new Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 with 6-speed automatic transmission, now the sole powertrain choice for all models. Interior trim was restyled on both vans, in addition to major exterior revisions highlighted by the new &quot;double-crosshair&quot; grille on the Grand Caravan. The Grand Caravan no longer had its own distinct headlight assemblies and now shared a common design with the Town &amp; Country.

Other changes included extra sound insulation, acoustic glass, new seats, softer-touch surfaces, new LED ambient lighting and center console, and halogen projector headlamps with LED accents. The Chrysler models were adjusted so that instead of competing against equivalent Dodge trim levels, they were above Dodge in trim and features. The door chime was also updated in 2011, to match the rest of the Chrysler line-up.

==== 2012 model year ====
For 2012, a new, basic style trim called &quot;AVP&quot; was introduced, while some features previously unavailable for &quot;SE&quot; (like touch navigation panel) become available as options (The &quot;SE&quot; now also received a floor console, similar to the one available for &quot;SXT&quot;). The same year, the front logo design was changed gaining the two slanted rectangles in red to match the rest of the Dodge lineup. For 2013, the American Value Package &quot;AVP&quot; trim manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price (MSRP) was reduced by $1,000 from the year before.

==== 2013 model year ====
The Grand Caravan added a class-exclusive feature with an optional Blu-Ray DVD player while the base &quot;AVP&quot; model was described by Autotrader.com editors as having a &quot;shockingly low MSRP&quot; giving buyers &quot;incredible utility&quot; in their vehicle.

==== 2014 model year ====
For the 2014 model year, three new packages were introduced: American Value Package (US), Canada Value Package (Canada), Blacktop package (US only), and the 30th Anniversary Edition. They are all different sets of SE and SXT trims and include new luxury features for the same price. The Grand Caravan AVP also gained easy-clean floor mats that came with the optional second-row Stow&#x27;n Go seats (standard on SE, SXT, and R/T).

The &quot;Blacktop Package&quot;, based on SE and SXT, came equipped with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with gloss black pockets, a gloss black grille, black headlamp bezels, an all-black interior including headliner, door panels and console, unique black cloth seats and door trim panels with silver accent stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with silver accent stitching and a leather shift knob, choice of 6 body colors (Granite Crystal, Billet Silver, Brilliant Black, Maximum Steel, Redline Red, Bright White). SXT models also include fog lamps.

The &quot;SE 30th Anniversary Edition&quot;, based on the SE trim, came equipped with 17-inch satin carbon aluminum wheels, body-color heated exterior mirrors, 30th Anniversary badging on the front fenders, silver accent stitching and piano black accents throughout, black cloth seats, a black leather-wrapped steering wheel, black leather-wrapped shift knob, black headliner and overhead console, bright heating and air conditioning trim bezels, power second- and third-row windows, and 30th Anniversary logo on the key fob

The &quot;SXT 30th Anniversary Edition&quot;, based on the SXT trim, was packaged with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with satin carbon pockets, bright chrome roof rack, bright window trim moldings, fog lamps, automatic headlamps, and special 30th Anniversary badging, Black Torino leatherette seats with premium suede inserts and silver accent stitching, power 10-way driver&#x27;s seat, piano black accent trim bezels, and bright chrome accents throughout.

Both 30th Anniversary Editions included an available special body color, Granite Crystal Pearl Coat, a customized gauge cluster with 30th Anniversary badging, as well as the UConnect Handsfree Group (SiriusXM Satellite Radio with a one-year subscription, Bluetooth streaming audio and voice command and an auto-dimming rear view mirror). The vehicles arrived at dealerships at Q3 2013.

Also new for the 2014 model year, the Grand Caravan R/T gained standard auto headlamps with black bezels and the Security Group featuring remote start and security alarm.

==== 2015 model year ====
The Grand Caravan was not changed for the 2015 model year except for content features added to SE Plus and SXT Plus trims. The SE Plus package included black leather upholstery, power windows for the second-row seats, and Chrysler&#x27;s Uconnect voice command with Bluetooth sound system.

==== 2016 model year ====
The new Chrysler Pacifica was unveiled on January 11, 2016, and getting all the attention, but the Dodge Grand Caravan continued to be marketed as a budget minivan alternative.

==== 2017 model year ====
A small 2017 model year update was applied to SE, SE Plus, SXT, and GT (replacing the R/T) models. The 6.5-inch Touchscreen (Radio 430 and 430 NAV) became standard equipment with rear-view cameras on all models. (Navigation is standard on GT and optional on SXT.) The GT model also included monochromatic exterior and premium leather interior with red accent stitching

Sales of the Grand Caravan began in Mexico during this model year, positioned as the most accessible minivan in its class. Three models available in the Mexican market were SE, SXT and SXT Plus.

FCA unveiled the Chrysler Pacifica, a new minivan for the 2017 model year, at the 2016 North American International Auto Show. The Pacifica replaced the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, but it was originally stated that the 2016 model of the Dodge Caravan would be produced for one more model year as a lower-cost alternative to the Pacifica, before being discontinued. In January 2017, FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne stated that it was not clear if the Caravan would be discontinued, and that they would have to look into offering &quot;some level of affordable access to the Pacifica at the lower end to try and replace the outgoing models&quot; (this would eventually come in the form of the sixth-generation Voyager, which was briefly produced alongside the RT Caravan). Despite the introduction of the higher-cost Pacifica model, sales of the Caravan increased by 26% in 2016. A substantial number of Caravans are sold to low-margin rental fleets. The vehicle continues to be positioned for price-conscious customers and it draws traffic to dealerships when the vehicle is aggressively priced. Additionally, FCA provided various rebates and incentives to assist purchases of the Grand Caravan and other models by customers with credit scores of less than 620.

According to a report by an automotive journalist, this strategy helps the Chrysler Pacifica hold its value better while also having a more affordable minivan available. Over 60% of the Dodge Caravan&#x27;s sales goes to fleet sales and the vehicle was the second best selling vehicle for rental fleet sales.

==== 2018 model year ====
Production of Grand Caravans was temporarily suspended from September to November 2017 with the assembly of the 2018 model year versions starting in December 2017. The production line required changes to install airbags that meet U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 226 calling for larger and more robust side-impact air curtains, as well as for them to deploy in the event of either a side-on collision or a rollover. Beginning with the 2018 models, changes included advanced multistage driver and front-passenger airbags that include low-risk deployment, a driver&#x27;s-side inflatable knee blocker, front seat-mounted side airbags, and side-curtains for outboard passengers in all three rows.

For 2018, the Grand Caravan was Dodge&#x27;s best-selling vehicle while the sales of foreign-branded minivans fared worse than the Dodge in 2018. Sales in Canada dropped 30 percent, significantly lower than in the previous six years.

==== 2019 model year ====
The 2019 model year marked the 35th anniversary of the Chrysler minivans. A commemorative trim option was available on the SE and SXT models that included a bright grille, 17-inch &quot;tech silver&quot; aluminum wheels, a 35th Anniversary fender badge as well as &quot;piano black&quot; console and instrument panel accents and front floor mats with 35th Anniversary embroidered logo. A &quot;Blacktop Package&quot; featuring a black grille, headlamp bezels as well as an all-black interior was optional on SE and SXT 35th anniversary edition models.

The minivan market segment decreased in general. Sales of the Grand Caravan models in Canada declined by 9% during the first quarter of 2019, but it was still number 10 among the best-selling vehicles for that period in Canada. Most sales went to rental and fleet customers. The vehicle did not receive major changes, but continued to be produced because &quot;Dodge sold more than 125,000 Grand Caravans last year [2018], while Honda only sold 100,000 of its Odyssey minivans during the same year [2018].&quot;

The third shift at Windsor minivan plant ended in October 2019 due to sluggish sales, eliminating 1,500 direct jobs.

==== 2020 model year ====
Three models were available: SE, SE Plus, and SXT. The Grand Caravan SE Plus model now included standard second-row Super Stow &#x27;n Go bucket seats, a power eight-way driver seat, and an all-black interior with cranberry wine accent stitching on the seats. The optional &quot;Blacktop Package&quot; continued for the SE Plus and SXT models.

The Canadian market included six models starting from an entry-level version and then increasing the standard equipment on each: CVP, SXT, SXT Premium Plus, Crew, Crew Plus, and the GT which includes many convenience features as well as a performance suspension system and a monochromatic exterior. The &quot;Blacktop Package&quot; trim option is available on SXT models.

Trim levels for the Mexican market were unchanged from previous model years with SE, SXT and SXT Plus models available.

=== Safety ===
In the U.S. the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s (NHTSA) New Car Assessment Program crash testing, the 2020 Dodge Grand Caravan achieved an overall four star rating.

=== Variants ===

==== Europe ====

As with preceding generations, Chrysler marketed the Caravan in Europe as the Chrysler Voyager, with the fifth-generation becoming exclusively sold as the long-wheelbase Grand Voyager. From 2007 to June 2011, the model line was sold under the Chrysler brand; following the acquisition of Chrysler by Fiat, the Voyager was rebranded as a Lancia in continental Europe (with the Chrysler Voyager remaining in Ireland and the UK).

The Chrysler/Lancia Voyager was marketed under three trim lines distinct to Europe (Silver, Gold, and Platinum). The standard engine was a 2.8 L I4 diesel (producing 161 hp), with a 3.6 L gasoline V6 (producing 279 hp); both engines were paired to a 6-speed automatic.

Following the 2016 model year, exports of the Voyager were discontinued as Fiat Chrysler reorganized its brands, with Chrysler remaining largely in North America and Lancia sold exclusively in Italy.

==== Ram Cargo Van (Ram C/V Tradesman) ====
For the 2012 model year, the Ram Trucks division received the Dodge Grand Caravan C/V cargo van, renaming it the Ram Cargo (C/V) Tradesman (reviving the name used by Dodge for its full-size cargo vans during the 1970s). In contrast to its predecessor, the Tradesman was strictly a two-seat vehicle, with solid metal body paneling in place of rear windows and a flat rear load floor.

As the Ram brand increased its use of Fiat-based vehicles, the Tradesman was replaced for 2016 by the ProMaster City, an American-market version of the Fiat Doblò.

==== Volkswagen Routan ====

After a five-year hiatus, Volkswagen re-entered the minivan segment in North America by introducing the Volkswagen Routan for the 2009 model year. Replacing the Transporter T4 (1992, 1999–2003 EuroVan) in North America, the Routan was sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Targeting approximately 5% of the sales within the minivan segment, Volkswagen entered into a 5-year production agreement with Chrysler.

The Routan was manufactured by Chrysler at its Windsor Assembly facility alongside the Grand Caravan and Town &amp; Country, styled with its model-specific interior trim and front and rear exterior fascias. While sharing powertrains with the Grand Caravan, the Routan was given its own suspension tuning and seating configurations (the last Chrysler-designed minivans with lift-out seats). As part of the 2011 update of the Chrysler minivans, the Grand Caravan received the stiffer suspension tuning previously used by Volkswagen; while receiving the 3.6 L V6, the Routan carried over much of its interior.

Falling far under sales expectations, the final Routans were produced by Chrysler in August 2012; all 2013 sales were from dealer inventory, with 2014 vehicles sold exclusively to fleets. Originally predicting to sell 50,000 units per year, Volkswagen sold 57,683 Routans through its four years of production. As Volkswagen shifted to SUVs in North America, the Routan minivan was replaced for 2018 by the three-row Atlas (also replacing the Touareg in North America).

== Discontinuation ==

For 2017, Chrysler introduced its sixth-generation minivan, with the Chrysler Pacifica replacing the Chrysler Town &amp; Country. Initially slated to end production following the 2016 model year, the Dodge Grand Caravan would live on through the 2020 model year. Although introduced in 2008, FCA marketed the model line below the Pacifica as the Dodge version continued fleet sales and its popularity in Canada.

After scheduling in February 2020 for production to end in May 2020, FCA later extended the date by three months to end assembly on August 22. In production for nearly 37 years (13 years as the fifth-generation RT platform), the final Dodge Grand Caravan rolled off the Windsor, Ontario, Canada assembly line on August 21, 2020.

==Sixth generation 2021 + Canadian-market Grand Caravan==
For 2021, Chrysler revived both the Voyager and Caravan nameplates under the Chrysler brand. Replacing entry-level trims of the Pacifica minivan, the Voyager is sold in the United States while the Grand Caravan is marketed in Canada. The two vehicles differed only in nameplates, but Chrysler retained the &quot;Grand&quot; extended-length prefix for the Grand Caravan (despite offering only a single length of minivans since 2008)

The 2022 Grand Caravan was no longer available in the lower SE model. The SXT incorporates the updated Uconnect 5 software for the 7-inch infotainment system with six speakers and active noise cancellation. Differences with the Pacifica include its standard 10.1-inch touchscreen and it is about longer than the Grand Caravan.

The 2023 model year the Chrysler Grand Caravan continued and available exclusively for Canada. It is a de-contented version of the U.S. version Pacifica and available in only the SXT trim.

The 2024 model year Chrysler Grand Caravan adds two new exterior colors, Baltic Grey and Red Hot.

<doc id="319389" wikidata="Q1201123" url="?curid=319389" title="Daphnis et Chloé">
<text>Daphnis et Chloé is a 1912 &quot;symphonie chorégraphique&quot;, or choreographic symphony, for orchestra and wordless chorus by Maurice Ravel. It is in three main sections, or &quot;parties&quot;, and a dozen scenes, most of them dances, and lasts just under an hour, making it the composer&#x27;s longest work. In effect it is a ballet, and it was first presented as such. But it is more frequently given as a concert work, either complete or excerpted, vindicating Ravel&#x27;s own description above. 

The dance scenario was adapted by choreographer Michel Fokine from a pastoral romance by the Greek writer Longus thought to date from the 2nd century AD, recounting the love between the goatherd Daphnis and the shepherdess Chloé. Scott Goddard in 1926 published a commentary on the changes to the story Fokine had to apply in order to make the scenario workable.

==Composition and premiere==
Ravel began to write the score in 1909 after a commission from impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his Ballets Russes, completing it some months before the premiere of the staged work. This took place at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on 8 June 1912, with sets designed by Léon Bakst, choreography by Fokine, and the Orchestre Colonne conducted by Pierre Monteux. Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky danced the shepherdess and goatherd.

==Musical description==
At almost an hour long, &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; is Ravel&#x27;s longest work. Four discernible leitmotifs give it musical unity. The music, some of the composer&#x27;s most passionate, is widely regarded as some of his best, with extraordinarily lush harmonies typical of the Impressionist movement; even during the composer&#x27;s lifetime commentators described it as his masterpiece for orchestra.

==Suites of excerpts==
Ravel extracted music from the &quot;symphonie&quot; to make two orchestral suites, which can be performed with or without the chorus. The first was prepared as early as 1911, that is, before the staging. The second, essentially &quot;Partie III&quot; of the whole, was issued in 1913 and is particularly popular. (When the complete work is performed it is more often in concert than staged.) Ravel adhered to his description of the music in his formal titling of the suites: 
*&quot;Fragments symphoniques de ‘Daphnis et Chloé’ (Nocturne—Interlude—Danse guerrière)&quot;, 1911, commonly called Suite No. 1
*&quot;Fragments symphoniques de ‘Daphnis et Chloé’ (Lever du jour—Pantomime—Danse générale)&quot;, 1913, or Suite No. 2

==Scenario==
===Part I===

On the island of Lesbos, in a meadow at the edge of a sacred wood stands a grotto hewn out of rock, at the entrance of which is an antique sculpture of three Nymphs. Somewhat toward the background, to the left, a large rock vaguely resembles the form of the god Pan. In the background sheep are grazing. It is a bright spring afternoon. When the curtain rises, the stage is empty. Youths and girls enter, carrying gifts for the Nymphs in baskets. Gradually the stage fills. The group bows before the altar of the Nymphs. The girls drape the pedestals with garlands. In the far background, Daphnis is seen following his flock. Chloé joins him. They proceed toward the altar and disappear at a bend. Daphnis and Chloé enter at the foreground and bow before the Nymphs.

The girls entice Daphnis and dance around him. Chloé feels the first twinges of jealousy. At that moment she is swept into the dance of the youths. The cowherd Dorcon proves to be especially bold. Daphnis in turn seems upset. At the end of the dance, Dorcon tries to kiss Chloé. She innocently offers her cheek, but with an abrupt motion Daphnis pushes aside the cowherd and approaches Chloé affectionately. The youths intervene. They position themselves in front of Chloé and gently lead Daphnis away. One of them proposes a dance contest between Daphnis and Dorcon. A kiss from Chloé will be the victor’s prize. The group sarcastically imitates the clumsy movements of the cowherd, who ends his dance in the midst of general laughter. Everyone invites Daphnis to accept his reward. Dorcon comes forward as well, but he is chased off by the group, accompanied by loud laughter.

The laughter ceases at the sight of the radiant group formed by the embracing Daphnis and Chloé. The group withdraws, taking along Chloé. Daphnis remains, immobile, as if in ecstasy. Then he lies face down in the grass, his face in his hands. Lyceion enters. She notices the young shepherd, approaches, and raises his head, placing her hands over his eyes. Daphnis thinks this is a game of Chloé’s but he recognizes Lyceion and tries to pull away. As though inadvertently, she drops one of her veils. Daphnis picks it up and places it back on her shoulders. She resumes her dance, which, at first more languorous, becomes steadily more animated until the end. Another veil slips to the ground, and is again retrieved by Daphnis. Vexed, she runs off mocking him, leaving the young shepherd very disturbed. Warlike sounds and war cries are heard, coming nearer. In the middle ground, women run across the stage, pursued by pirates. Daphnis thinks of Chloé, perhaps in danger, and runs off to save her. Chloé hastens on in panic, seeking shelter. She throws herself before the altar of the Nymphs, beseeching their protection.

A group of brigands burst on stage, capture the girl and carry her off. Daphnis enters looking for Chloé. He discovers on the ground a sandal that she lost in the struggle. Mad with despair, he curses the deities who were unable to protect the girl, and falls swooning at the entrance of the grotto. As night falls, an unnatural light suffuses the landscape. A little flame shines suddenly from the head of one of the statues. The Nymph comes to life and descends from her pedestal, followed by the second and then the third Nymph. They consult together and begin a slow and mysterious dance. They notice Daphnis, bend down and dry his tears. They revive him and lead him toward the large rock, and invoke the god Pan. Gradually the form of the god is outlined. Daphnis prostrates himself in supplication.

===Part II===

Voices are heard from off stage, at first very distant. A trumpet calls and the voices come nearer. There is a dull glimmer. The setting is the pirate camp on a very rugged seacoast, with the sea as the background. To the right and left is a view of large crags. A trireme is seen near the shore and there are cypresses present. Pirates are seen running to and fro carrying plunder. More and more torches are brought, which illuminate the scene. Bryaxis commands that the captive be brought. Chloé, her hands tied, is led in by two pirates. Bryaxis orders her to dance. Chloé performs a dance of supplication. She tries to flee, but she is brought back violently. Despairing, she resumes her dance. Again she tries to escape but is brought back again. She abandons herself to despair, thinking of Daphnis. Bryaxis tries to carry her off. Although she beseeches, the leader carries her off triumphantly. Suddenly the atmosphere seems charged with strange elements. Various places are lit by invisible hands, and little flames flare up. Fantastic beings crawl or leap here and there, and satyrs appear from every side and surround the brigands. The earth opens and the fearsome shadow of Pan is outlined on the hills in the background, making a threatening gesture. Everyone flees in horror except Chloé, who is given a wreath crown.

===Part III===

Morning at the grotto of the Nymphs. There is no sound but the murmur of rivulets produced by the dew that trickles from the rocks. Daphnis lies, still unconscious, at the entrance of the grotto. Gradually the day breaks. The songs of birds are heard. Far off, a shepherd passes with his flock. Another shepherd crosses in the background. A group of herdsmen enters looking for Daphnis and Chloé. They discover Daphnis and wake him. Anxiously he looks around for Chloé. She appears at last, surrounded by shepherdesses. They throw themselves into each other’s arms. Daphnis notices Chloé’s wreath. His dream was a prophetic vision. The intervention of Pan is manifest. The old shepherd Lammon explains that, if Pan has saved Chloé, it is in memory of the nymph Syrinx, whom the god once loved. Daphnis and Chloé mime the tale of Pan and Syrinx. Chloé plays the young nymph wandering in the meadow. Daphnis, as Pan, appears and declares his love. The nymph rebuffs him. The god becomes more insistent. She disappears into the reeds. In despair, he picks several stalks to form a flute and plays a melancholy air. Chloé reappears and interprets through her dance the accents of his flute. The dance becomes more and more animated, and in a mad whirling, Chloé falls into Daphnis’s arms. Before the altar of the Nymphs, he pledges his love, offering a sacrifice of two sheep. A group of girls enters dressed as bacchantes, shaking tambourines. Daphnis and Chloé embrace tenderly. A group of youths rushes on stage and the ballet ends with a bacchanale.

*&quot;Danse de Lycéion&quot;
*&quot;Danse lente et mystérieuse des Nymphes&quot;

===Part II===
*&quot;Introduction&quot;

===Part III===
*&quot;Lever du jour (Sunrise)&quot;
*&quot;Pantomime (Les amours de Pan et Syrinx)&quot;

==In popular culture==
American trumpeter Harry James, in his 1942 arrangement of Eric Coates&#x27;s &quot;By the Sleepy Lagoon&quot;, made use of the &quot;Sunrise&quot; from Part III for its opening theme. The title song from the musical &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; is similar to the same passage.

<doc id="319395" wikidata="Q738325" url="?curid=319395" title="Bianca Castafiore">
<text>Bianca Castafiore (), nicknamed the &quot;Milanese Nightingale&quot; (), is a fictional character in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. She is an opera singer who frequently pops up in adventure after adventure. While famous and revered the world over, most of the main characters find her voice shrill and appallingly loud, most notably Captain Haddock, who ironically is the object of Castafiore&#x27;s affections. She also has a habit of mispronouncing everyone&#x27;s names (such as &quot;Hammock&quot;, &quot;Paddock&quot;, and &quot;Fatstock&quot; for Haddock), with the exception of Tintin and her personal assistants. Castafiore is comically portrayed as narcissistic, whimsical, absent-minded, and talkative, but often shows a more generous and essentially amiable side, in addition to an iron will.

Her given name means &quot;white&quot; (feminine) in Italian, and her surname is Italian for &quot;chaste flower&quot;. She first appeared in 1939, but from the 1950s, Hergé partially remodelled her after the Greek soprano Maria Callas.

==Character history==
The comical Italian opera diva first appears in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, and is also in &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;, and would have appeared in the unfinished &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot;. She is played on radio in &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; and in &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, Captain Haddock imagines her singing in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney,&quot; and mentions her famous aria in &quot;Destination Moon.&quot; Although she is apparently one of the leading opera singers of her generation, the only thing that Castafiore is ever heard to sing are a few lines of her signature aria, &quot;The Jewel Song&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;air des bijoux&quot;, from Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;), always at ear-splitting volume (and violent force—certainly enough to part the Captain&#x27;s hair, shatter glasses and a breeze enough to blow back a curtain in an opera box—&quot;She&#x27;s in fine voice tonight.&quot;).

When on tour, she usually travels with her piano accompanist, Igor Wagner, and her maid, Irma.
At odds with her reputation as a leading opera singer, in &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, she appears third on the bill of a variety show (although at an opera house), following a genuine clairvoyant act and a knife thrower (revealed to be General Alcazar), and preceding a magician. She is depicted as a preening, melodramatic diva, although she has a kind heart. In &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, for example, she provides a diversion to distract the sinister Colonel Sponsz so that Tintin and Captain Haddock can escape and rescue their friend Calculus. A recurring comic trope in the series is Haddock&#x27;s aversion to Castafiore, who can never remember his name (addressing him variously as Hammock, Paddock, Padlock, Hemlock, Hassock, Havoc, Maggot, Bartok, and Bootblack, among other names). Gossip journalists once reported a romance and engagement between Castafiore and Haddock in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, complete with photographs of Castafiore showing a disgruntled Haddock the flowers in his own garden. This quite chagrined the captain, but not the diva, who was quite used to such inventions from the tabloids.

Castafiore was once falsely imprisoned by the South American dictator General Tapioca and Colonel Sponsz in order to lure Calculus, Haddock and Tintin to San Theodoros where they prepare a deadly trap for them and Tapioca&#x27;s rival, Alcazar (&quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;). Their ruse backfired, not least because Castafiore expressed her contempt for her show trial and her life sentence with her trademark ear-splitting rendition of the Jewel Song. The court had to be cleared. In prison, Castafiore made her jailers suffer even more by throwing her pasta over their heads because they had not cooked it &quot;al dente&quot;.

==Character background and influences==
Opera was one of Hergé&#x27;s pet peeves. &quot;Opera bores me, to my great shame. What&#x27;s more, it makes me laugh,&quot; he once admitted. And so, perhaps not surprisingly, he created an archetypical singer who makes the reader laugh.

Though la Castafiore is obviously Italian, her pet aria is from a French opera (&quot;Faust&quot; was composed by Charles Gounod) rather than the Verdi, Puccini, Bellini, or Donizetti one might have expected from a star of La Scala (although in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, she mentions that her regular repertoire includes Rossini, Puccini, Verdi, and Gounod. She is also called by La Scala to perform in “La Gazza Ladra”, by Rossini, an opera whose title is the key to solving the mystery of the thefts in the episode.) &quot;Faust&quot;, and this aria in particular, was among the most famous of all operas in Hergé&#x27;s time. Furthermore, the choice of this aria is intentionally comic: Hergé depicts the aging, glamorous and utterly self-absorbed opera diva as Marguerite, the picture of innocence, taking delight in her own image in the mirror, with the oft-repeated quote: &quot;Ah, I laugh to see myself so beautiful in this mirror!&quot;.

Bianca Castafiore is portrayed by Kim Stengel in the 2011 film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, which merges plots from several books. Renée Fleming provided the singing voice. Although Sra. Castafiore invariably sings her signature aria in Hergé&#x27;s books, in the film, the character presents a different aria, &quot;Je veux vivre...&quot; from Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Romeo et Juliette&quot;. Oddly, the lead-in (played by an invisible orchestra) is the introduction to yet another coloratura aria, &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot;, from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barber of Seville&quot;.

The asteroid 1683 Castafiore, discovered in 1950, is named after the character.

Kim Newman includes Castafiore in his alternative history novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;Dracula Cha Cha Cha&quot; along with many other characters from other authors.

Bianca Castafiore is said to have been inspired by Hergé&#x27;s own grandmother – Hergé believed that his father was an illegitimate son of the Belgian king Leopold II, but only his grandmother could have known the truth. He added subtle references such as operas that Bianca sang, referring to such stories.

<doc id="319396" wikidata="Q3328745" url="?curid=319396" title="Music of Polynesia">
<text>The music of [[Polynesia]] is a diverse set of musical traditions from islands within a large area of the central and southern Pacific Ocean, approximately a triangle with New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island forming its corners. Traditional Polynesian music is largely an inseparable part of a broader performance art form, incorporating dance and recital of oral traditions; most literature considers Polynesian music and dance together.

Polynesian music expanded with colonial European contact and incorporated instruments and styles introduced through a process of acculturation that continues to the present day. Although the European tradition of hymn-singing brought by Christian missionaries was probably the most important influence, others are evident; Hawaii&#x27;s influential (“slack key”) music incorporated the Spanish guitar introduced in the late 19th century, and later introduced the steel guitar to country music. Hip hop and R&amp;B influences have created a contemporary Urban Pasifika music genre with a strong Polynesian identity and supported by the annual Pacific Music Awards in New Zealand.

==Christian music==
In the 1790s, Christian missionaries arrived in Polynesia for the first time. Hymns and other forms of Christian music were instituted, and native musical genres were driven underground and prohibited. Soon, traditional polyphonic singing was merged with Christian styles and church singing, and along with brass bands became an important part of Polynesian music culture across the Pacific.

==Popular music==
Popular music in Polynesia is a mixture of more traditional music made with indigenous instruments such as the nose flute in Tonga, and the distinctive wooden drums of the Rarotonga, and local artists creating music with contemporary instruments and rhythms, and also a blend of both. In the 1980s, Fijian stars like Laisa Vulakoro and Lagani Rabukawaqa became popular across the Pacific. 

Raiatea Helm is an internationally touring Hawaiian singer who has won has been nominated for the Grammys. Kalani Pe&#x27;a is a popular Hawaiian singer songwriter who has also won two Grammys. His music is traditional style Hawaiian songs, and include four-part-harmony oli aloha (greeting chants of appreciation) as well as contemporary Hawaiian music. He also translates popular songs into Hawaiian language. Na Hoku Hanohano Awards are music awards in Hawaii. 

There is a form of reggae called Pacific reggae which features different instruments such as the ukulele and Pacific Island drums than reggae in other places. Herbs is a popular New Zealand band in this genre. J Boog (USA) is a reggae performer of Samoan descent based in Hawaii. Chris Boomer is a reggae artists from Guam. 

Polynesian heritage artists feature in pop music culture including Dinah Jane (USA) of Fifth Harmony. 

Some Polynesian islands have developed a cassette industry, most notably Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. 

===Steel guitar===
Popular Hawaiian inspired musicians include steel guitarists Bill Sevesi and Bill Wolfgramm who led popular dance bands during the 1950s.

<text>Music of Tonga refers to music derived from the island Tonga in the islands of Polynesia. Music of Tonga today generally falls under the category of traditional music that has withstood the test of time, or into one of the two opposing genres of religious and secular music. Tongan music can be either very emotional and somewhat modern with instrumental makeup including modern brass instruments, or conversely can be more traditional and consist of only drums and voices. In this way, Tongan music is very diverse despite the fact that it is contained to a fairly small island, which means that the different cultures and styles co-exist on the small land mass together without blending.

==Colonial History==
Tonga was invaded by European explorers in 1616. Early invaders, such as Captain Cook in the 1770s, and William Mariner in the 19th century, describe traditional dance performances featuring singing and drumming.

The first proselytizing religious zealots, English Methodists, arrived in 1822. By 1830, most of the population were nominally Christian. Western church music and Western classical and popular music would then start to mingle with the pure Tongan music, resulting in the often hybrid music of contemporary Tonga. Now popular guitar styles are used throughout Tonga too.

==Surviving traditional music==
Traditional music is preserved (though how faithfully we can only guess) in the set pieces performed at royal and noble weddings and funerals, and in the song sung during the traditional ceremony of apology, the &quot;lou-ifi&quot;.

Radio Tonga begins each day&#x27;s broadcast with a recording from Veehala, a nobleman and celebrated virtuoso of the nose flute. The nose flute is otherwise rarely heard. Contemporary youth prefers the guitar.

Some ancient dances are still performed, such as ula, otuhaka and meetuupaki.

The &quot;lali&quot; or slit-gong, is still in use—as a substitute for a church bell by congregations that cannot afford a bell.
In the late 19th century, missionaries introduced hymns popular in England and Australia at the time, keeping the Western tunes and translating the lyrics into Tongan. These hymns are still sung in the largest Methodist church, the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga.

Other Christian denominations have introduced their own musical traditions. The Roman Catholic church in Tonga, while a minority church, has been notable for its accepting attitude towards traditional Tongan culture. Their church music, however, follows Western Catholic models.

In the smaller churches and the minority Methodist sects, hymn singing is unaccompanied, &quot;hiva usu&quot;. A strong singer will sing the first notes alone (a practice called &quot;hua&quot; or opening) and the rest of the congregation will then join. Church choirs are popular, practice is frequent, and most congregations sing all hymns in harmony.

Free Wesleyan Churches feature not only choirs, but brass bands. It is possible that this tradition comes from northern England, a strongly Methodist area, where participating in brass bands is a popular amusement. Visitors may regret that the blaring bands drown out the delicate harmonies of the hymns, but Tongans glory in the size and splendor of their bands as they do the size and splendor of their churches. Smaller churches have no bands, but aspire to them.

All the Methodist churches have occasional choir exhibitions (&quot;po hiva&quot;), held in the larger churches, to which all the neighboring congregations are invited. Choirs practice assiduously to show off their prowess before their rivals. Handel&#x27;s Hallelujah Chorus is frequently sung at these festivals, being esteemed as the epitome of choir display.

Hymn-singing is greatly practiced at the wakes before funerals. Relatives sit with the body, while mourners come to make their last greetings to the departed and to bring gifts to the bereaved. The church choir (from the family&#x27;s own congregation) sits in the background, singing hymns through the day and night.

==Secular music==

Secular music is composed in a gamut of styles, ranging from the semi-traditional to the aggressively &quot;pop&quot; influenced by overseas styles. The usual instruments are voice, guitar, and sometimes the players from the church brass band.

&quot;Hiva kakala&quot; (fragrant songs, meaning love poems) are an important part of the semi-traditional group. Many of the ones still popular nowadays were made by queen Sālote in the 1950s and are the favourite tunes for the tauʻolunga dances. Another important part in this group are the more formal songs, slanted towards odes to the chiefs and the royal family. They are the ideal choice for dances like the māʻuluʻulu or the lakalaka, Tonga&#x27;s national dance form.

Mixed dancing, or &quot;hulohula&quot; as practiced at parties and clubs in the Western world, is still comparatively rare. It is not a feature of village life, and can be found only in the cities, such as Nukuʻalofa.

Most village musicians display their talents only in church, or at the &quot;koniseti&quot;. The &quot;koniseti&quot; or concert is a display of dance and song, usually done as a fundraiser for some worthy cause, such as a sports team or a local congregation. The musicians consist usually of singers, guitar players, and possibly a church brass band. The music is melodic and minor key; it serves as background to the dancers. Sometimes villagers will rehearse a &quot;koniseti&quot; for months and then tour neighboring villages or even islands. The size of the receipts is commensurate with the quality of the show, and there is great incentive to excel. At other times the &quot;koniseti&quot; may be performed only once, for a special occasion.

Music is often heard in Tongan towns and villages, but it is usually music from Radio Tonga. Radio Tonga is a state-run radio station; it starts broadcasting early in the morning and ends late at night. It can be heard even in the smallest villages on the remotest islands, blasting from the omnipresent &quot;tepi&quot;s or combination radio/tape cassette players (usually battery powered). One weary Western visitor was heard to complain, in 1980, &quot;You can&#x27;t get away from Radio Tonga&quot;.

Radio Tonga plays music from local Tongan musical groups, Fijian and Samoan bands, Hawaiʻian music, etc. It also broadcasts church services and choir competitions, so it disseminates church music as well as popular music. The Tongan groups usually feature strong vocals, solo or choral, haunting minor key harmonies, and guitar backup. To the unsophisticated Western ear, it savors of American country music.

Western pop is also popular among a younger audience, though disapproved by elders and churches. It can bought as CD or tape, seen on DVD or videotape, picked up on short-wave radio, viewed in movie theatres, or even watched on the one TV station, broadcasting from the capital city of Nukualofa. However, government censors significantly limit what can be imported, or played.

Local custom also plays a part. It is forbidden to mention sexual topics in front of men and women who have a brother-sister relationship. This applies not only to brothers and sisters by Western reckoning, but also to cousins. Hence sexual references are taboo in most public situations where both men and women are present.

Contemporary Tongan pop music has reached outside Tonga, but only to the Tongan diaspora in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.

No Tongan artists have achieved a cross-over hit. However, the Jets, an R&amp;B/pop octet of the mid-1980s, had a string of hits on the American charts . The Minneapolis-based act consists of eight brothers and sisters whose mother and father had emigrated to the U.S. from Tonga.

<text>The music of the [[Cook Islands]] is diverse. Christian music is extremely popular. Imene tuki is a form of unaccompanied vocal music known for a uniquely Polynesian drop in pitch at the end of the phrases, as well as staccato rhythmic outbursts of nonsensical syllables (&quot;tuki&quot;). The word &#x27;imene&#x27; is derived from the English word &#x27;hymn&#x27; (see Tahitian: &#x27;himene&#x27; - Tahiti was first colonised by the English). Likewise the harmonies and tune characteristics / &#x27;strophe patterns&#x27; of much of the music of Polynesia is western in style and derived originally from missionary influence via hymns and other church music. One unique quality of Polynesian music (it has become almost a cliché) is the use of the sustained 6th chord in vocal music, though typically the 6th chord is not used in religious music. Traditional songs and hymns are referred to as &quot;imene metua&quot; (lit. &quot;hymn of the parent/ancestor&quot;).

Traditional dance is the most prominent art form of the Cook Islands. Each island has its own unique dances that are taught to all children, and each island is home to several annual competitions. Traditional dances are generally accompanied by the drumming of the pate.

The Cook Islands drumming style is well known internationally, but is often misidentified as an example of Tahitian music. This is most uncommon as the Cook Islands have a strong connection to their Tahitian ancestry.

Harmony-singing church music and a wide variety of hymns and wedding and funeral music are found throughout the Cook Islands. There is much variation across the region, and each island has its own traditional songs.

<text>The music of [[French Polynesia]] came to the forefront of the world music scene in 1992, with the release of The Tahitian Choir&#x27;s recordings of unaccompanied vocal Christian music called himene tārava, recorded by French musicologist Pascal Nabet-Meyer. This form of singing is common in French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, and is distinguished by a unique drop in pitch at the end of the phrases, which is a characteristic formed by several different voices; it is also accompanied by steady grunting of staccato, nonsensical syllables.

<text>Villa Sin Miedo is a community near Río Grande, Puerto Rico. It made national headlines in Puerto Rico during a number of raids in the early 1980s, including one in which a policeman was shot to his death.

==History==
Villa Sin Miedo was a community of about 300 families that occupied a place called Dolores Farm. They established their community on government land in November 1980 but it was razed by police on May 18, 1982, amid violent clashes where a policeman was shot and killed.

==Villa Sin Miedo in the exhibition Contrasts by Jack and Irene Delano==

Historian and writer Ana Juarbe writes in an article titled &quot;Imposing the Past on the Present: History, the Public, and the Columbus Quincentenary&quot; about the photographs of Villa Sin Miedo in Jack Delano&#x27;s exhibition that &quot;despite US citizenship, Puerto Rican national sentiment is convincingly expressed by land rescuers from a community known as &quot;Villa Sin Miedo&quot;.

==Villa Sin Miedo in the book Puerto Rico Mio: Four decades of Change photographs by Jack Delano ==

In the book &quot;Puerto Rico Mio&quot; are two photographs of Villa Miedo from 1982. The caption on the first photograph reads &quot;1982 - Villa Sin Miedo, an illegal community of homeless squatters, near Carolina; a few days after this picture was taken the people were ejected by the police and the houses burned.&quot; The caption on the second photograph (pg 143) there is a picture of a resident of Villa Sin Miedo inside of a room of a house. The caption reads &quot;1982 - One of the squatters in the community known as Villa Sin Miedo near Carolina.&quot;

In the first photo can be seen around twenty five wooden houses. They are arranged around a central dirt road that appears from the left side of the image and unfolds up towards a hill that reaches the horizon and meets a distant mountain scape. Six motor vehicles and a couple handfuls of people can be seen in that photo.

In the second photo a resident is seated on a bed inside a small room. A Puerto Rican flag covers half of the wall to his back.

==Villa Sin Miedo on the web==

On October 15, 2007, a video compilation of images of &quot;Villas sin miedo y villas del sol&quot; was uploaded to YouTube by kelekasherebo. The video shows photographs of the brutality of confrontations with the police. And the continuation of the communities despite the attacks.

On October 20, 2007, the video appears in Indymedia&#x27;s website

<text>Henri de Tonti (born Enrico Tonti; – September 1704) was an Italian-born French military officer and explorer who assisted René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle during the French colonization of the Americas from 1678 to 1686. de Tonti was one of the first explorers to navigate and sail the upper Great Lakes. He also sailed the Illinois and the Mississippi, to its mouth and thereupon claimed the length of the Mississippi for Louis XIV of France. He is credited with founding the settlement that would become Peoria, Illinois. De Tonti established the first permanent European settlement in the lower Mississippi valley, known as &quot;Poste de Arkansea&quot;, making him &quot;The Father of Arkansas&quot;.

== Early life and military service ==
Henri de Tonti was born in Gaeta, , to Lorenzo and Isabelle (née di Lietto) de Tonti. His father was the governor of Gaeta and a Neapolitan banker. He is credited with inventing the tontine, a form of life insurance, though it has been suggested he merely modified existing Italian life insurance practices. Lorenzo was involved in a revolt against the Spanish viceroy in Naples, and the family was forced to seek asylum in France around the time of Henri&#x27;s birth. Henri&#x27;s brother Alphonse was born in 1659, and later became one of the founders of what is now Detroit. Henri de Tonti&#x27;s cousins, Daniel Greysolon Dulhut and Claude Greysolon de La Tourette were also able to build a name for themselves in New France.

In 1668 around the age of 18, De Tonti decided to join the French military. He was a cadet in the French Royal Army for his first two years of military service. For the following four years, De Tonti was commissioned into the French Navy as a midshipman, being stationed at Marseilles and Toulon and embarking on seven tours at sea, four of which were on tall ships and three on galleys. He later became captain-lieutenant of the &quot;maître de camp&quot; in Messina. This was a French army that Louis XIV sent to Sicily in 1675 under the command of the Duke of Vivonne to support the Messina revolt during the Franco-Dutch War.

De Tonti took part in military operations in the village of Gesso, up the hills near Messina. He lost his hand in a grenade explosion, later replacing it with a metal appliance. He was also taken as a prisoner of war. After being detained for six months, De Tonti was exchanged for the Governor&#x27;s son. After returning to France, De Tonti continued his deployment as a volunteer on the galleys. From that time on, wore a prosthetic hook covered by a glove, thus earning the nickname &quot;Iron Hand&quot;. Among the officers fighting beside the French expedition corps, there were the brothers Antonio and Thomas Crisafy, who years later de Tonti will have the chance to meet again in New France. After the Franco-Dutch War, De Tonti was unable to obtain employment until recruited by La Salle, for exploration.

== New France ==
In the summer of 1678, De Tonti journeyed to Quebec with René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle; who recognized him as an able associate and thus named De Tonti his lieutenant. On August 27, Tonti and La Salle arrived in Gulf St. Lawrence. De Tonti described it as &quot;A place extremely cold where no wheat grows&quot;. On December 26 of the same year, de Tonti and La Salle reached the Niagara. De Tonti was left to supervise the construction of Fort Conti below Niagara Falls and the construction of the &quot;Griffon&quot; in early 1679 above the falls, which was to be the first ship to sail the Great Lakes.

In August 1679, De Tonti arrived at Fort Michilimackinac, the crossroads for southwestern fur trade, in which he discovered some of La Salle&#x27;s crew had fled to and traded many livre&#x27;s worth of goods. After rounding up the deserters, De Tonti sailed to the mouth of the St. Joseph and helped establish Fort Miami. Early in 1680. de Tonti also helped build &quot;Fort de Crèvecoeur&quot; in Illinois, which La Salle left de Tonti to hold while he returned to Ontario. While on his return trip up the Illinois, La Salle concluded that Starved Rock might provide an ideal location for another fortification and sent word downriver to de Tonti regarding this idea.

Following La Salle&#x27;s instructions, de Tonti took five men and departed up the river to evaluate the suitability of the Starved Rock site. Shortly after de Tonti&#x27;s departure, on April 16, 1680, the seven members of the expedition who remained at Fort de Crèvecoeur ransacked and abandoned the fort and began their own march back to Canada. This opened up opportunity for Iroquois warriors to attack, stabbing de Tonti and forcing his men to retreat to &quot;Baie-des-Puants&quot; in late 1680. In 1681, after recuperating from his injuries, De Tonti traveled to Fort Michilimackinac to rejoin La Salle.

=== Co-founder of Fort St. Louis, Illinois ===
In the spring of 1682, de Tonti journeyed with La Salle on his descent down the Mississippi and helped establish alliances with Native Americans by presenting the calumet (a peace pipe) to the Natchez tribe, allowing La Salle to travel three leagues inland to meet with their chief. Assuming they had made peace with the tribe, De Tonti tried to convince the Natchez to relocate near their new fort, Fort St. Louis, to conduct trade with one another. La Salle departed for France in 1683 to gather colonists for a new Louisiana venture, leaving de Tonti behind to hold Fort St. Louis.

In La Salle&#x27;s absence, Joseph-Antoine Le Febvre de La Barre, the governor of New France, confiscated all of La Salle&#x27;s new territory. Barring de Tonti&#x27;s aid in fighting off Iroquois attackers, de Tonti was no longer in command of the Illinois territory and was replaced by Louis-Henri de Baugy. de Tonti ventured back to Quebec in the spring of 1684. La Barre later rescinded his decision to seize La Salle&#x27;s territories, and De Tonti ventured back in 1685.

Word reached De Tonti that La Salle was in the Gulf of Mexico, causing de Tonti to proceed to the south in 1686 to try to meet him on his ascent. Instead of meeting La Salle, De Tonti established a trading post in Arkansas, leaving six Frenchman to establish a permanent French settlement to trade with the Quapaw and hinder English colonial settlement in the east by establishing a presence in the middle of North America.
In 1689, after receiving news that La Salle had been killed by his own men, de Tonti had begun journeying to La Salle&#x27;s abandoned settlement in Baie Saint-Louis. Unfortunately, De Tonti was ill-prepared and turned back before he could reach the settlement and returned to Illinois. In late winter 1690, resources grew scarce and he moved Fort St. Louis to Pimiteoui (present-day Peoria). This new Fort St. Louis (also known as Fort Pimiteoui) later became the main trading post for the French.

In the summer of 1685 Jacques-René de Brisay, Marquis de Denonville replaced La Barre as the governor of New France. Denonville decided that war with Iroquois was inevitable, promising Illinois &quot;every protection&quot; as well as consultation from De Tonti on military excursions. Denonville made de Tonti&#x27;s key role in this military campaign, execution. De Tonti was to mount an assault with 300 men from the rear of the Iroquois while Denonville launched a full frontal assault. De Tonti was unable to mount a large enough number of his men, so he joined with Sieurs de l&#x27;hut and de la Durantais at the front of the strait. de Tonti and the others proceeded to their rendezvous on Lake Ontario and met up with Denonville and took part in the van of the French attack against the Senecas.

They later set a military post in Niagara. In 1687, De Tonti was engaged in conflict with English colonists and their Iroquois allies. During this period, he was also able to conduct treaties with Native American tribes. In 1690, after he was granted La Salle&#x27;s fur trading commission, de Tonti decided to aid French colonization in Illinois by engaging in trade. In the summer of 1697, he left Illinois in the care of his cousin Pierre de Liette. De Tonti then commenced on a journey down the Mississippi to make contact with Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville, who had established the Louisiana colony. De Tonti reached Louisiana and joined the colony.

=== Later life and death ===
Following this, De Tonti was offered by Pierre Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville the opportunity to work as a treaty negotiator and peacemaker. Working under Pierre Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville&#x27;s brother Jean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, De Tonti was able to bring peace between the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations of Louisiana and proceeded to receive aid from the two nations. The use of his appliance that replaced his hand led these tribes to believe he had special powers. De Tonti died in September 1704 from yellow fever. It is believed that De Tonti&#x27;s “remains were laid to everlasting rest in an unknown grave near the Mobile, and not far from the monument erected in 1902 to commemorate the site of old Mobile&quot;.

<doc id="319415" wikidata="Q1908904" url="?curid=319415" title="Maton">
<text>Maton is an Australian musical instruments manufacturing company based in Box Hill, Melbourne. It was founded in 1946 by Bill May and his brother Reg. The name &quot;Maton&quot; came from the words &quot;May Tone&quot; and is pronounced &quot;May Tonne&quot;.

Products currently manufactured by Maton include acoustic guitars and guitar pickups.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1946 as the &quot;Maton Musical Instruments Company&quot; by Bill May and his brother Reg. Reg was a wood machinist, while Bill was a jazz musician, woodwork teacher and luthier who had for some years operated a custom guitar building and repair business under the name &quot;Maton Stringed Instruments and Repairs&quot;.

At first the company produced high-quality acoustic instruments for students and working professionals, aiming at providing good value for money and experimenting with the use of Australian woods. In the 1960s they expanded into electric instruments and instrument amplifiers, at first under the name Magnetone. The early catalogues noted that the warranties on amplifiers and loudspeakers were void if used in situations of &quot;overload or distortion&quot;, reflecting May&#x27;s jazz background but incredible to modern electric guitarists of any style.

Maton established itself early on the Australian rock scene in the late 1950s, assisted by Australia&#x27;s tariff regime, which made imported guitars far more expensive than the local equivalents. Maton guitars were used by many well-known Australian pop and rock groups including Col Joye &amp; The Joy Boys. The company also made one of the first sponsorship deals in Australian rock, supplying Melbourne band The Strangers with a full set of the distinctive &#x27;El Toro&#x27; model guitars and basses (notable for their outlandish &#x27;horned&#x27; body shape) while the group was working as the house band on the TV pop show &quot;The Go!! Show&quot; in the mid-Sixties.

Maton earned international renown for their superb acoustic and electric guitars and basses, which have been played by scores of famous performers from The Easybeats to The Wiggles. George Harrison owned one of their MS500 models, which were introduced in 1957 and famed British session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan owned and used a Maton &#x27;Cello&#x27; guitar for many years during the peak of his career, playing it on recordings with Sarah Vaughan, Sammy Davis Jr., Johnny Keating and his Big Band and Neil Finn from Crowded House.
Australian singer Frank Ifield also owned and used a Maton guitar, which he later had fitted with a custom-made scratch plate, made in the shape of a map of Australia. Frank gave this instrument to his guitarist Ray Brett when he returned to Australia, and it has been featured on an episode of the BBC programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. Although these guitars are now normally worth around £2,000, expert Bunny Campione valued Ifield&#x27;s guitar at between £10,000 and £15,000, because Ifield had used it in songs featured in a compilation album alongside The Beatles&#x27; first two singles.

Easybeats lead guitarist Harry Vanda is probably the best-known Maton player of the Sixties, and his famous red Maton Sapphire semi-acoustic 12-string (which he donated to the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney in 1999) was an integral part of the Easybeats&#x27; sound throughout their career, and features prominently on hit singles like &quot;I&#x27;ll Make You Happy&quot;.

Australian guitarist, Tommy Emmanuel, owns many Matons and almost exclusively uses the BG808 acoustic model on his latest albums. Maton has even constructed a Tommy Emmanuel &quot;TE series&quot; according to Tommy&#x27;s specifications. His understudy Kieran Murphy also uses Matons. Joe Robinson plays Maton guitars and was the company&#x27;s featured performer at the Frankfurt Musikmesse in 2009.

Ben Harper and Jack Johnson use Matons. Renowned guitar instructor Justin Sandercoe uses Maton acoustic guitars. Australian singer-songwriter Vance Joy regularly uses the Maton guitar The Maton Heritage ECW80

== Products ==
Current products manufactured by Maton include steel-string acoustic guitars and guitar pickups. Some of them are:

* Mini Maton: Maton&#x27;s small body acoustic guitar. It uses Maton&#x27;s AP5 pickup system.
*Maton EBG808TE: The TE series guitars are designed in conjunction with guitar virtuoso Tommy Emmanuel. Other models in the TE series are EBG808TEC, TE1 and the TE Personal.
*Maton SRS70C: A hollow body single cut acoustic guitar with a tortoiseshell pickguard and a rosewood neck. The SRS70C comes in both 6 and 12 string form.
