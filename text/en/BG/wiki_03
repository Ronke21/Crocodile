<text>Edmund Sixtus Muskie (March 28, 1914March 26, 1996) was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 58th United States Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter from 1980 to 1981, a United States Senator from Maine from 1959 to 1980, the 64th governor of Maine from 1955 to 1959, and a member of the Maine House of Representatives from 1946 to 1951. He was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for vice president in the 1968 presidential election.

Born in Rumford, Maine, he worked as a lawyer for two years before serving in the United States Naval Reserve from 1942 to 1945 during World War II. Upon his return, Muskie served in the Maine State Legislature from 1946 to 1951, and unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Waterville. Muskie was elected the 64th governor of Maine in 1954 under a reform platform as the first Democratic governor since Louis J. Brann left office in 1937, and only the fifth since 1857. Muskie pressed for economic expansionism and instated environmental provisions. Muskie&#x27;s actions severed a nearly 100-year Republican stronghold and led to the political insurgency of the Maine Democrats.

Muskie&#x27;s legislative work during his career as a senator coincided with an expansion of modern liberalism in the United States. He promoted the 1960s environmental movement which led to the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972. Muskie supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the creation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and opposed Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Imperial presidency&quot; by advancing New Federalism. Muskie ran with Vice President Hubert Humphrey against Nixon in the 1968 presidential election, losing the popular vote by 0.7 percentage point—one of the narrowest margins in U.S. history. He would go on to run in the 1972 presidential election, where he secured 1.84 million votes in the primaries, coming in fourth out of 15 contesters. The release of the forged &quot;Canuck letter&quot; derailed his campaign and sullied his public image with Americans of French-Canadian descent.

After the election, Muskie returned to the Senate, where he gave the 1976 State of the Union Response. Muskie served as first chairman of the new Senate Budget Committee from 1975 to 1980, where he established the United States budget process. Upon his resignation from the Senate, he became the 58th U.S. Secretary of State under President Carter. Muskie&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of State was one of the shortest in modern history. His department negotiated the release of 52 Americans, thus concluding the Iran hostage crisis. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Carter in 1981 and has been honored with a public holiday in Maine since 1987.

==Early life and education==
Edmund Sixtus Muskie was born on March 28, 1914, in Rumford, Maine. He was born after his parents&#x27; first child, Irene (born 1912), and before his brother Eugene (born 1918) and three sisters, Lucy (born 1916), Elizabeth (born 1923), and Frances (born 1921). His father, Stephen Marciszewski, was born and raised in Jasionówka, Russian Poland and worked as an estate manager for minor Russian nobility. He immigrated to America in 1903 and changed his name to Muskie from &quot;Marciszewski&quot; in 1914. He worked as a master tailor and Muskie&#x27;s mother, Josephine (née Czarnecka) worked as a housewife. She was born to a Polish-American family in Buffalo, New York. Muskie&#x27;s parents married in 1911, and Josephine moved to Rumford soon after.

Muskie&#x27;s first language was Polish; he spoke it as his only language until age 4. He began learning English soon after and eventually lost fluency in his mother language. In his youth he was an avid fisherman, hunter, and swimmer. He felt as though his given name was &quot;odd&quot; so he went by Ed throughout his life. Muskie was shy and anxious in his early life but maintained a sizable number of friends. Muskie attended Stephens High School, where he played baseball, participated in the performing arts, and was elected student body president in his senior year. He would go on to graduate in 1932 at the top of his class as valedictorian. A 1931 edition of the school&#x27;s newspaper noted him with the following: &quot;when you see a head and shoulders towering over you in the halls of Stephen&#x27;s, you should know that your eyes are feasting on the future President of the United States.&quot;

Influenced by the political excitement of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s election to the White House, he attended Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. While at college, Muskie was a successful member of the debating team, participated in several sports, and was elected to student government. Although he received a small scholarship and New Deal subsidies, he had to work during the summers as a dishwasher and bellhop at a hotel in Kennebunk to finance his time at Bates. He would record in his diaries occasional feelings of insecurity among his wealthier Bates peers; Muskie was fearful of being kicked out of the college as a consequence of his socioeconomic status. His situation would gradually improve and he went on to graduate in 1936 as class president and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Initially intending to major in mathematics he switched to a double major in history and government.

Upon his graduation, he was given a partial merit-based scholarship to Cornell Law School. After his second semester there, his scholarship ran out. As he was preparing to drop out, he heard of an &quot;eccentric millionaire&quot; named William Bingham II who had a habit of randomly and sporadically paying the university costs, mortgages, car loans, and other expenses of those who wrote to him. After Muskie wrote to him about his immigrant origins he secured $900 from the man allowing him to finance his final years at Cornell. While in law school he was elected to Phi Alpha Delta and went on to graduate &quot;cum laude&quot;, in 1939. Upon graduating from Cornell, Muskie was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1939.

He then worked as a high school substitute teacher while he was studying for the Maine Bar examination; he passed in 1940. Muskie moved to Waterville and purchased a small law practice—renamed &quot;Muskie &amp; Glover&quot;—for $2,000 in March 1940. He helped write Waterville&#x27;s first zoning ordinance and was elected secretary of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

=== Marriage and children ===

Jane Frances Gray was born February 12, 1927, in Waterville to Myrtie and Millage Guy Gray. Growing up, she was voted &quot;prettiest in school&quot; in high school and at age 15, started her first job, in a dress shop. At age 18, Gray was hired to be a bookkeeper and saleswoman in an exclusive haute couture boutique in Waterville. While there, a mutual friend tried to introduce her to Muskie while he was working in the city as a lawyer. She had Gray model the dresses in the shop window while he was walking to work. Muskie came into the shop one day and invited her to a gala event. At the time, she was 19 and he was 32; their difference in age stirred controversy in the town. However, after eighteen months of courting Gray and her family, she agreed to marry him in a private ceremony in 1948. Gray and Muskie had five children: Stephen (born 1949), Ellen (born 1950), Melinda (born 1956), Martha (born 1958, d. 2006), and Edmund Jr. (born 1961). The Muskies lived in a yellow cottage at Kennebunk Beach while they lived in Maine.

== U.S. Navy Reserve, 1942–1945 ==
In June 1940, President Roosevelt created the V-12 Navy College Training Program to prepare men under the age of 28 for the eventual outbreak of World War II. Muskie formally registered for the draft in October 1940 and was formally called to deck officer training on March 26, 1942. At 28, he was assigned to work as a diesel engineer in the Naval Reserve Midshipmen&#x27;s School. On September 11, 1942, Muskie was called to Annapolis, Maryland to attend the United States Naval Academy. He left his law practice running so &quot;his name would continue to circulate in Waterville&quot; while he was gone. He trained as an apprentice seaman for six weeks before being assigned the rank of midshipman.

In January 1943, Muskie attended diesel engineering school for sixteen weeks before being assigned to First Naval District, Boston in May. Muskie worked on the for a month. In June, he was assigned to the at Fort Schuyler in New York, where he worked as an indoctrinator. In November 1943, Muskie was promoted to Deck Officer. He trained for two weeks in Miami, Florida at the Submarine Chaser Training Center. After that, Muskie was relocated to Columbus, Ohio to study reconnaissance in February 1944. In March, he was promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade). Muskie was stationed at California&#x27;s Mare Island in April temporarily before formally engaging in active duty warfare.

Muskie began his active duty tour aboard the destroyer escort . His vessel was in charge of protecting U.S. convoys traveling from the Marshal and Gilbert Islands from Japanese submarines. The &quot;Brackett&quot; escorted ships to and from the islands for the majority of summer 1944. In January 1945, the ship engaged and eventually sank a Japanese cargo ship headed for Taroa Island. After a few more months of escorting ships to and from the two islands, the ship was decommissioned. He was discharged from the Navy on December 18, 1945.

== Maine House of Representatives ==

Muskie returned to Maine in January 1946 and began rebuilding his law practice. Convinced by others to run for political office as a way of expanding his law practice, he formally entered politics. Muskie ran against Republican William A. Jones in an election for the Maine House of Representatives for the 110th District. Muskie secured 2,635 votes and won the election to most people&#x27;s surprise on September 9, 1946. During this time, the Maine Senate was stacked 30-to-3 and the House was stacked 127-to-24 Republicans against Democrats.

Muskie was assigned to the committees on federal and military relations during his first year. He advocated for bipartisanship, which won him widespread support across political parties. On October 17, 1946, Muskie&#x27;s law practice sustained a large fire, costing him an estimated $2,300 in damages. However, a yearly stipend of $800 and help from other business leaders who were affected by the fire quickly restarted his practice.

Muskie&#x27;s work with city ordinances in Waterville prompted locals to ask him to run in the 1947 election to become Mayor of Waterville, against banker Russel W. Squire. Perhaps due to incumbency advantage, Muskie lost the election with 2,853 votes, 434 votes behind Squire. Some historians believe that his loss had to do with his inability to gain traction with Franco-American voters.

Muskie continued his political involvement locally by securing a position on the Waterville Board of Zoning Adjustment in 1948 and stayed in this part-time position until he became governor. He later returned to the House to start his second term in 1948 as Minority Leader against heavy Republican opposition. Muskie was appointed the chairman of the platform committee during the 1949 Maine Democratic Convention. During the convention, he brought together a variety of the political elite of Maine—notably Frank M. Coffin and Victor Hunt Harding—to plan a comeback for the party. On February 8, 1951, Muskie resigned from the Maine House of Representatives to become acting director for the Maine Office of Price Stabilization. He moved to Portland soon after and was assigned the inflation-control and price-ceiling divisions. His job required him to move across Maine to spread word about economic incentives which he used to increase his name recognition. He served as the regional director at the Office of Price Stabilization from 1951 to 1952. Upon leaving the Office he was asked to join the Democratic National Committee as a member; he served on the committee from 1952 to 1956.

In April 1953, while working on renovations for his family home in Waterville, Muskie broke through a balcony railing, falling down two flights of stairs. He landed on his back, knocked
unconscious. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained unconscious for two days. Doctors believed that Muskie was in a coma, so they gave him comatose-specific medication which caused him to regain consciousness but start to hallucinate. Muskie tried to jump out of the hospital window, but was restrained by staff members. After a couple of months, through physical rehabilitation and corrective braces, he was able to walk once more.

== Governor of Maine, 1955–1959 ==

===Gubernatorial campaign===
After establishing a prominent presence in the Maine State Legislature and with the Office of Price Stabilization, he officially launched his bid in the 1954 Maine gubernatorial race as a Democrat. Burton M. Cross, the Republican incumbent governor, was seeking reelection. Had he won, he would have been the fifth consecutive Governor to be reelected. Throughout the election Muskie was viewed as the underdog because of the Republican stronghold in Maine. Muskie acknowledged this himself by saying, &quot;[this is] more as a duty than an opportunity because there was no chance of a Democrat winning.&quot; A variety of personal reasons motivated his run. Muskie was deeply in debt owing five thousand dollars in hospital bills and maintained a rising mortgage. At the time of his election, the salary for the Governor of Maine was set at ten thousand dollars annually. While he was campaigning he was offered a position involving full partnership at a prestigious Rumford law firm that maintained &quot;clients and income that [Muskie] had not achieved in fourteen years of practice in Waterville.&quot; His final choice reflected his &#x27;society over self&#x27; mentality and decided to pursue the election. He announced his candidacy for the office on April 8, 1954.

Muskie ran on a party platform of environmentalism and public investment. His environmental platform argued for the establishment of the Maine Department of Conservation to &quot;have jurisdiction of forestry, inland fish and game, sea and shore fisheries, mineral, water, and other natural resources&quot; and the creation of anti-pollution legislation. He stressed the need for &quot;a two-party&quot; approach to Maine politics with resonated with both Democratic and Republican voters wishing to see change. Muskie&#x27;s central campaign slogan was &quot;Maine Needs A Change&quot; referencing the multi-year Republican stronghold. He criticized the Republican Party for neglecting the environment, failing to restart the economy, underutilizing skilled labor forces, and ignoring public investment.

He successively won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, and then the general election by a majority popular vote on September 13, 1954. The upset victory made Muskie the first Democrat to be elected chief executive of Maine since Louis J. Brann in 1934. His election has been viewed as a causal link to the end of Republican political dominance in Maine and the rise of the Democratic Party. After his win, he was asked by other Democrats running in elections outside of Maine to make a series of campaign stops.

===First term===

Muskie was inaugurated as the 64th Governor of Maine on January 6, 1955. He was the state&#x27;s first Roman Catholic governor. Shortly after his assumption of the office, the next election cycle stacked the legislature with a 4-to-1 Republican-Democrat ratio against Muskie. Through bipartisanship and his aggressive personality he managed to pass the majority of his party platform. Constituents pressured him to more aggressively pursue water control and anti-pollution legislation. In August, the Maine State Legislature authorized him to take extraordinary action to control the state&#x27;s pollution standards. He used this authority to sign the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Compact on August 31, 1955. This compact required member states to pay for anti-pollution measures collectively. Conservative members of the Chamber of Commerce fought back against Muskie in his attempt to allocate money to the compact and greatly reduced the amount paid. One of the chief concerns of Muskie during this time was economic development. Maine&#x27;s population was aging, putting pressure on welfare services. He expanded certain programs and cut down on others in order rebalance state spending. Before leaving office Muskie signed an executive order extending the gubernatorial term to four years.

He expanded the territory comprising Baxter State Park by 3,569 acres and purchased 40 acres (1.7 million ft2) of Cape Elizabeth from the federal government for $28,000. He also created the Department of Development of Commerce and Industry and Maine Industrial Building Authority. In February 1955, he was briefed on atomic energy power by the United States Atomic Energy Commission leading him to limit the expansion of atomic-powered electrical facilities.

=== Second term ===
On September 10, 1956, Muskie was re-elected Governor of Maine by 55,859 votes against Republican Willis A. Trafton. He won 14 of the 16 counties. He began his second term by aggressively enforcing environmental standards. In 1957, he sanctioned a $29 million highway bond. This bond funded the largest road construction ever undertaken by Maine. The highway included 91 bridges and was extended in 1960 and 1967 by Interstate 95.

During his tenure as Governor he retained a reputation for increased spending in public education, subsidized hospitals, modernized state facilities, and cumulatively raised state sale taxes by 1%. He added $4 million to infrastructure development focusing on roads and river maintenance. Muskie pushed aggressive economic expansionism. In 1957, he founded the Maine Guarantee Authority which combated economic maturation-related job loss making capital more accessible for business owners. Muskie also sporadically lowered sales tax, increased the minimum wage and furthered labor protections leading to a marked increase in consumer spending. He amended the constitution of Maine in order divert $20 million in public funds into private investment. He increased subsidies to expensive institutions such as public primary and secondary schools as well as universities. Although initially founded in 1836, the Maine State Museum was closed and reopened six times before Muskie permanently endowed it in 1958.

His governorship exploited multi-factionalism in the Republican Party leading to a vast expansion of the Democratic Party in Maine. From 1954 to 1974, the party doubled in size, while the Republican Party steadily decreased from 262,367 to 227,828 registered members. Numerous state politicians mimicked his political style to push their programs through various local governments and garnered electoral success. His executive appointments of moderate politicians shifted the entire Republican establishment in the state to the left. This shift garnered comparisons to Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s influence in Minnesota and George McGovern&#x27;s impact in South Dakota. During his last months as governor he changed his office&#x27;s term from two years to four years. Shortly before leaving office he moved Maine&#x27;s general election date from September to November conclusively ending the notion that &quot;as Maine goes, so goes the nation&quot;. This was attempted thirty-six times before Muskie brought about a constitutional amendment that moved the date.

Muskie resigned on January 2, 1959, to take his seat in the United States Senate after the 1958 Senate election. He was succeeded by Republican Robert Haskell in an interim capacity until the Governor-elect, Democrat Clinton Clauson, was inaugurated. Muskie was officially succeeded by Clauson on January 6, 1959.

== United States Senate, 1959–1980 ==

=== Elections and campaigns ===
Muskie&#x27;s first contestation for the Senate of the United States was in 1958. He announced his intent to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Frederick G. Payne on March 20, 1958. Muskie won the election with 61% of the vote against Payne&#x27;s 39%. Muskie&#x27;s victory made him the first Democrat elected to the Senate in Maine, with the state&#x27;s previous Democratic Senator having been appointed by the legislature. He was one of the 12 Democrats who overtook Republican incumbents and established the party as the party-of-house during the election cycle. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that during this election that the absentee ballots requested for Democrats increased considerable signaling voter-discontent with Republican ideology. This election was considered the largest single-party gain in the Senate&#x27;s history.

He ran for a second term in 1964, running against Republican Clifford McIntire. Muskie won with 67% of the vote.

==== Election eve speech ====
His third campaign and election to the Senate occurred in 1970. During the 1970 elections, Muskie secured 62% of the vote against Republican Neil S. Bishop&#x27;s 38%. The elections were seen as tumultuous due to the United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War and rising unpopularity of incumbent president Richard Nixon. On the night of poll-opening Muskie gave a nationwide, 14 minute speech to addressed American voters following a similar address by Nixon. Dubbed the &quot;election eve speech&quot; it spoke to American exceptionalism and against &quot;torrents of falsehood and insinuation&quot;. The speech was considered bipartisan and was well received by both parties. Political analysts believed that the speech influenced voting patterns during the election as there were thirty million listeners. Commentators received the speech as &quot;essentially evangelical&quot; and indicative of &quot;a volcanic private temper but a soothing public manner&quot;. The most famous passage from the speech was widely commented on by the public for its biting nature and critique of &quot;politics of fear&quot;:

I am speaking from Cape Elizabeth, Maine to discuss with you the election campaign which is coming to a close. In the heat of our campaigns, we have all become accustomed to a little anger and exaggeration. That is our system. It has worked for almost two hundred years—longer than any other political system in the world. But in these elections of 1970, something has gone wrong. There has been name-calling and deception of almost unprecedented volume. Honorable men have been slandered. Faithful servants of the country have had their motives questioned and their patriotism doubted. It has been led . . . inspired . . . and guided . . . from the highest offices in the land. ... We cannot make America small. ... Ordinarily that division is not between parties, but between men and ideas. But this year the leaders of the Republican party have intentionally made that line a party line. They have confronted you with exactly that choice. Thus—in voting for the Democratic party tomorrow—you cast your vote for trust—not just in leaders or policies—but for trusting your fellow citizens . . . in the ancient traditions of this home for freedom . . . and most of all, for trust in yourself.

The &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; on November 4, 1970, noted it akin to Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s fire-side chats &quot;with video&quot;. The speech has been the subject of numerous studies regarding &quot;the dimensions of the televised public address as an emerging rhetorical genre of pervasive influence in contemporary affairs&quot;.

In his fourth and final election, Muskie ran against Republican Robert A. G. Monks in 1976; he won 60% of the vote compared to Monk&#x27;s 40%. The elections coincided with the election of Jimmy Carter as president leading to a large influx of Democratic support, though Carter lost Maine to incumbent President Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election.

=== First and second term ===
Edmund Muskie was sworn into office as U.S. Senator from Maine on January 3, 1959. His first couple of months in the Senate earned a reputation for being combative and often sparred with Majority Leader, Lyndon B. Johnson, who subsequently relegated him to outer seats in the Senate. In the next five years, he gained significant power and influence and was considered among the most effective legislators in the Senate. However, increased power and influence prompted supporters in Maine to label him &quot;an honorary Kennedy&quot;, alluding to the indifference John F. Kennedy had to Massachusetts when first gaining political traction. Muskie used the influence gain in his first two terms to push a vast expansion of environmentalism in the late 1950s and early 1960s. His specific goals were to curb pollution and provide a cleaner environment. Occasional speeches on environmental preservation earned him the nickname &quot;Mr. Clean&quot;.

He served his entire career in the Senate as a member of the Committee on Public Works, a committee he used to execute the majority of his environmental legislation. He served on the Committee on Banking and Currency from 1959 to 1970; the Committee on Government Operations until 1978. As a member of the Public Works Committee, he traveled to the Soviet Union in 1959. He sponsored the Intergovernmental Relations Act, later that year.

In 1962, he co-founded the United States Capital Historical Society along with other members of congress. The same year, members of Congress elected him to serve as the first chair of the Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution. In 1963, he was the first to sponsor a new Act to regulate air pollution. The Clean Air Act of 1963 was written and developed by Muskie and his aide Leon Billings.

His first major accomplishment was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He assembled more than one hundred votes for the proposed legislation eventually passing it. Also during 1964, he was critical of J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s management of the Federal Bureau of investigation. Muskie was upset by its &quot;overzealous surveillance and its director&#x27;s intemperance&quot;. Muskie also sponsored the construction of the Roosevelt Campobello International Park near Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s New Brunswick estate. Due to its international nature, Muskie was asked to chair a joint U.S.-Canada commission to maintain the park. In 1965, he was again sponsored the Water Quality Act (later to be known as the Clean Water Act). He was the floor manager for the discussion and led to its passage in 1965 and its successful amendments in 1970.

Alongside President Johnson&#x27;s Great Society and War on Poverty programs, Muskie drafted the Model Cities Bill which eventually passed both houses of Congress in 1966. Previously, combative with Johnson, Muskie began developing a more cooperative relationship with him. During Johnson&#x27;s signing of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act he said: I am pleased that Senator Muskie could be with us this afternoon. I believe that no man has done more to encourage cooperation among the National Government, the States, and the cities.&quot; Also in 1966, Muskie was elected assistant Democratic whip and served as the floor manager for the Clean Water Restoration Act.

During 1967 the popular sentiment in the U.S. was anti-war, which prompted Muskie to visit Vietnam to inform his political stance in 1968. Prior to his visiting the country, he debated with a congressman on a pro-war platform. After the trip, he became a leading voice for the anti-war movement and entered into the ongoing debate by speaking at the year&#x27;s Democratic Convention. His speech was followed by &quot;tens of thousands of protestors surrounded the convention and violent clashes with police carried on for five days.&quot; He wrote to Johnson personally asserting his position on the Vietnam War. He made the case that the U.S. ought to withdraw from Vietnam as quickly as possible. Months later, he wrote to the president again urging him to end the bombing of North Vietnam. During the same year, he traveled with other Senators to the Republic of South Vietnam to validate their elections.

Later, at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, he led the debate for the administration plank on Vietnam, which sparked public outrage. On October 15, 1969, he was welcomed to the green at Yale University to address the issues regarding his vote but chose to decline the offer and speak that night at his alma mater, Bates College, in Lewiston, Maine. His decision to do so was widely criticized by the Democratic party and Yale University officials. From 1967 to 1969, he served as the chair of Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He voted against the appointment of Clement Haynsworth to the U.S. Supreme Court.

=== Third and fourth term ===
His third term began in 1970 by co-sponsoring the McGovern-Hatfield resolution to limit military intervention in the Vietnam War. During this time Harold Carswell was seeking appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. Muskie voted against him and Carswell failed the confirmation process. Muskie also proposed a six-month ban on domestic and Soviet Union development of nuclear technologies to taper the nuclear arms race. As chair of the congressional environmental committee, he and fellow committee members including Howard Baker introduced the Clean Air Act of 1970, which was co-written by the committee&#x27;s staff director Leon Billings and minority staff director Tom Jorling. As part of the act, he told the automobile industry it would need to reduce its tailpipe air pollution emissions by 90% by 1977. He also co-wrote amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Act, more commonly known as the Clean Water Act, and urged his fellow Congress members to adopt it, saying &quot;The country was once famous for its rivers ... But today, the rivers of this country serve as little more than sewers to the seas. ... The danger to health, the environmental damage, the economic loss can be anywhere.&quot; The bill enjoyed bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress and was passed by the House on November 29, 1971, and the Senate on March 29, 1972. While congressional support was enough to enact it into law President Richard Nixon exercised his executive veto on the bill and stopped it from becoming law. However, after further campaigning by Muskie, the Senate and House of Representatives passed the bill 247–23 to override Nixon&#x27;s veto. The bill was historic in that it established the regulation of pollutants in the federal and state waters of the U.S., created extended authority for the Environmental Protection Agency, and created water health standards. Also in 1971, Muskie was asked to join the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; he traveled to Europe and the Middle East in this capacity.

After concluding his 1968 campaign for the White House he returned to the Senate. While in Chattanooga, the shooting of two black students at Jackson State College in 1970 by the Mississippi State Police, prompted Muskie to hire a jet airliner to take approximately one hundred people to see the bullet holes and attend a funeral of one of the victims. Critics in Maine described his actions as &quot;rash and self serving&quot; but Muskie publicly expressed no regret for his actions. At an event in Los Angeles, he publicly stated his support for several black empowerment movements in California, which garnered the attention of numerous media outlets, and black city councilman Thomas Bradley. In 1970, Muskie was chosen to articulate the Democratic party&#x27;s message to congressional voters before the midterm elections. His national stature was raised as a major candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972. In 1973, he gave the Democratic response to Nixon&#x27;s State of the Union address. During this time, he was appointed the chair of the intergovernmental relations subcommittee. Considered &quot;a backwater assignment&quot;, Muskie used it to advocate for a widening of governmental responsibilities, limiting the power of Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Presidency&quot; and advancing New Federalism ideals.

He served as the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee through the Ninety-third to the Ninety-sixth Congresses from 1973 to 1980. During this time, Congress founded the Congressional Budget Office in order to challenge Nixon&#x27;s budget request. Prior to 1974, there was no formal process for establishing a federal budget so Congress founded the office under the auspices of the Senate Budget Committee. As chairman, Muskie presided over, formulated, and approved of the creation of the United States budget process.

In 1977, he amended Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 along with others, to pass the Clean Water Act of 1977. These new additions incorporated &quot;non-degradation&quot; or &quot;clean growth&quot; policies intended to limit negative externalities. In 1978, he made minor adjustments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the &quot;Superfund&quot;.

== Campaigns for the White House ==

=== 1968 presidential election ===
==== Campaign ====

In 1968, Muskie was nominated for vice president on the Democratic ticket with sitting Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey asked Muskie to be his running mate because Muskie, in addition to being of Polish Catholic heritage, had a more reserved personality that would contrast well with Humphrey&#x27;s more ebullient style.

The Humphrey-Muskie ticket narrowly lost the popular vote to Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew. Humphrey and Muskie received 42.7% of the popular vote and carried 13 states and 191 electoral votes; Nixon and Agnew won 43.4% of the popular vote and carried 32 states and 301 electoral votes, while the third party ticket of George Wallace and Curtis LeMay, running as candidates of the American Independent Party, took 14% of the popular vote and took five states in the Deep South and their 46 votes in the electoral college. Because Agnew seemed a weaker candidate than Muskie, Humphrey remarked that voters&#x27; uncertainties about whom to choose between the two major presidential candidates should be resolved by their attitudes toward the vice-presidential candidates. While on the vice-presidential campaign trail in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Muskie was quoted as saying:

The truth is that Americans, born in this great tradition of humanism, still yield to prejudice and practice discrimination against other Americans. The truth is, having developed patterns and ways of living which reflect these shortcomings and weaknesses, we find it burdensome and difficult to – and all too often unacceptable to – do the uncomfortable things that we all must do to right the wrongs of our society.

=== 1972 presidential election ===

==== Background and primaries ====
Before the 1972 election, Muskie was viewed as a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Despite his strong polling, he continued to engage in tiring day-after-day speeches in various parts of the country. When asked during an August 17, 1969 appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; whether he would be a candidate in 1972, Muskie said it would depend on his being convinced that he could meet the challenges as well as his comfort. On November 8, 1970, Muskie said he would declare himself a candidate only if he became convinced he was best suited to unify the country.
An August 1971 opinion poll showed Muskie outperforming Nixon. In late 1971, Muskie gave an anti-war speech in Providence. The nation was at war in Vietnam and President Richard Nixon&#x27;s foreign policy promised to be a major issue in the campaign.

The 1972 Iowa caucuses, however, significantly altered the race for the presidential nomination. Senator George McGovern from South Dakota, initially a dark horse candidate, made a strong showing in the caucuses which gave his campaign national attention. Although Muskie won the Iowa caucuses, McGovern&#x27;s campaign left Iowa with momentum. Muskie himself had never before participated in a primary election campaign. Muskie went on to win the New Hampshire primary, but by a disappointingly small margin, and his campaign took a hit after the release of the &quot;Canuck letter&quot;.

==== &quot;Canuck letter&quot; ====

On February 24, 1972, a staffer from the White House forwarded a letter about Muskie to the &quot;Manchester Union-Leader&quot;. The forged letter, reportedly the successful sabotage work of Committee for the Re-Election of the President members Donald Segretti and Ken W. Clawson, asserted that Muskie had made disparaging remarks about French Canadians which were likely to injure his support among the French-American population in northern New England. The letter contained reference to French Canadians as &quot;Canucks,&quot; a term used affectionately by some Canadians, but regarded as offensive when referring to French Canadians, prompting journalists to refer to it as the &quot;Canuck letter.&quot;

A day later, the same paper released an article that portrayed Muskie&#x27;s wife, Jane as a drunkard and racially intolerant. On the morning of February 26, Muskie gave a speech to supporters outside of the &quot;Manchester Union-Leader&quot; offices in Manchester, New Hampshire. His speech was viewed as emotional and defensive; he called the newspaper&#x27;s editor a &quot;gutless coward.&quot; Muskie gave the speech during a snowstorm, which made it appear that he was crying. Though Muskie later claimed that the seeming tears were merely melted snowflakes, the press reported that Muskie broke down and cried, shattering the candidate&#x27;s image as calm and reasoned.

Evidence later came to light during the Watergate scandal investigation that, during the 1972 presidential campaign, the Nixon campaign committee maintained a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; unit focused on discrediting Nixon&#x27;s strongest challengers. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigators revealed that the Canuck Letter was a forged document as part of the dirty-tricks campaign against Democrats orchestrated by the Nixon campaign. Nixon was also reported to have ordered men to follow Muskie around and gather information. He tried to connect Muskie&#x27;s acquaintance with singer Frank Sinatra to an abuse of office. Muskie often flew on Sinatra&#x27;s private plane while traveling around California.

=== 1976 presidential election ===
In early July 1976, Muskie spoke with Jimmy Carter in a &quot;productive&quot; and &quot;harmonious&quot; discussion that was followed by Carter confirming that he considered Muskie qualified for the vice-presidential nomination. Carter ultimately selected Walter Mondale as his running mate.

==U.S. Secretary of State, 1980–1981==

In late April 1980, he was tapped by President Jimmy Carter to serve as secretary of state, following the resignation of Cyrus Vance. Vance had opposed Operation Eagle Claw, a secret rescue mission intended to rescue American hostages held by Iran. After that mission failed with the loss of eight U.S. servicemen, Vance resigned. Muskie was picked by Carter for his accomplishments with senatorial foreign policy. He was appointed and soon after confirmed by the Senate on May 8, 1980, by a margin of 94–2.

=== Draft Muskie movement ===
In June 1980, there was a &quot;draft Muskie&quot; movement among Democratic voters within the primaries of the 1980 presidential election. President Carter was running against Senator Ted Kennedy, and opinion polls ranked Muskie more favorably against Kennedy. One poll showed that Muskie would be a more popular alternative to Carter than Ted Kennedy, implying that the attraction was not so much to Kennedy as to the fact that he was not Carter. Moreover, Muskie was polled against Republican challenger Ronald Reagan at the time showing Carter seven points down. Due to a political allegiance with Carter, he backed out of the contention. Pressured by the Carter Administration, Muskie released the following public statement to Democratic voters: &quot;I accepted the appointment as secretary of state to serve the country and to serve the president. I continue to serve the president, and I will support him all the way! I have a commitment to the president. I don&#x27;t make such commitments lightly, and I intend to keep it.&quot; An article by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; speculated that the move to back Muskie was a temporary flex of political power by the Democratic voter base to unease Carter.

=== Afghanistan ===
In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan which prompted NATO to trigger its ally contract. Muskie began his tenure as secretary of state five months into the invasion. He assigned Deputy Secretary Warren Christopher the tasks of managing the domestic side of the department while he participated in international deliberations. Muskie met with Soviet diplomat Andrei Gromyko who categorically rejected a compromise that would secure the Soviet Union&#x27;s withdrawal from Afghanistan. Gromyko wanted the state department to formally recognize Kabul as a part of the Soviet Union.

=== Soviet Union ===

Muskie was against the rapid accumulation of highly developed weaponry during the 1950s and 1960s as he thought that would inevitably lead to a nuclear arms race that would erode international trust and cooperation. He spoke frequently with the government executives of Cold War allies and that of the Soviet Union urging them to suspend their programs in pursuit of global security. Muskie&#x27;s inclinations were confirmed during the early 1970s when Russia split from the U.S. and accumulated more warheads and anti-ballistic missile systems. In November 1980, Muskie stated that Russia was interested in pursuing a &quot;more stable, less confrontational&#x27; relationship with the United States.&quot; He criticized the stances undertaken by Ronald Reagan multiple times during his presidential campaign expressing disdain for the calls to reject the SALT II treaty. Muskie, throughout his political career, was deeply afraid of global nuclear war with the Soviet Union.

=== Iran hostage crisis ===

On November 4, 1979, 52 American diplomats and citizens were held hostage by an Iranian student group in Tehran&#x27;s U.S. Embassy. After the resignation of Cyrus Vance left a gap in the negotiations for the hostages, Muskie appealed to the United Nations (U.N.) and the government of Iran to release the hostages to little success. Already six months into the hostage crisis, he was pressed to reach a diplomatic solution. Before he assumed the position, the Delta Force rescue attempt called Operation Eagle Claw resulted in the death of multiple soldiers, leaving military intervention a sensitive course of action for the American public. He established diplomatic ties with the Iranian government and attempted to have the hostages released yet was initially unsuccessful. On January 15, 1981, as Muskie was flying to address the Maine Senate in Augusta, President Carter called him as his jet was touching down at Andrews Air Force Base. Carter alerted him that there was a possible breakthrough in the negotiations conducted by his deputy secretary Warren Christopher. After the negotiations failed, Muskie instructed the state department to continue seeking an agreement for the hostages&#x27; release. On January 20—the inauguration day of Ronald Reagan—the fifty-two hostages were handed over to U.S. authorities, a solution that had eluded Muskie and the entire Carter administration for 444 days and contributed to Carter&#x27;s defeat.

Muskie left office on January 18, 1981, two days before Carter&#x27;s last day as president and the inauguration of Ronald Reagan.

==Later years==

Muskie retired to his home in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1981. He continued to work as a lawyer for some years. After leaving public office, he was a partner with Chadbourne &amp; Parke, a law firm in Washington. Muskie also served as the chairman of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University as well as the chairman emeritus of the Center for National Policy.

In 1981, he was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics.

=== Tower Commission ===
In 1987, Muskie was appointed a member of the President&#x27;s Special Review Board known as the &quot;Tower Commission&quot; to investigate President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration&#x27;s role in the Iran-Contra affair. Muskie and the commission issued a highly detailed report of more than 300 pages that was critical of the president&#x27;s actions and blamed the White House chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, for unduly influencing the president&#x27;s activities. The panel was notable as the findings of the report were directly critical of the president who appointed the commission.

Muskie was critical of the commission decrying the &quot;over-obsession with secrecy,&quot; noting that &quot;there are occasions when it&#x27;s necessary to hold closely information about especially covert operations, but even possibly other operations of the Government. But every time that you are over-concerned about secrecy, you tend to abandon process.&quot; While underfunded, the commission did find that the Reagan administration ran a parallel policy directive at the same time they were publicly condemning negotiating for hostages.

== Death and funeral ==

Muskie died at 4:06 AM EST on the morning of March 26, 1996, at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., after seeking treatment for bouts of congestive heart failure. He died two days shy of his 82nd birthday. Eight days prior he underwent a carotid endarterectomy in his right neck. His assistant reported that he had suffered a myocardial infarction. Some historians believe that his blood clots were brought on from frequent 8,421 mile (13,552 km) flights to Cambodia; he was asked to assist in stabilizing its government on behalf of President Bill Clinton.

Due to his service in the United States Naval Reserve during World War II, he was eligible to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia. His ultimate rank of lieutenant had him placed in Section 25 of the cemetery. Although he died on March 26, his grave stone initially noted that he died on the 25th. His wife, Jane, died on December 25, 2004, at age 77, due to health complications brought on by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She was buried next to Muskie and his grave stone was corrected to read &quot;March 26, 1996&quot;.

Muskie was memorialized in Washington D.C., Lewiston, Maine, and Bethesda, Maryland. At his Washington memorial, he was paid tribute to by a variety of U.S. senators and house representatives. His &quot;alma mater—&quot;Bates College—held a memorial presided over by its president, Donald Harward. On March 30, 1996, a publicly broadcast, Roman Catholic funeral was held in Bethesda at the Church of the Little Flower. He was eulogized by U.S. president Jimmy Carter; U.S. Senator, George J. Mitchell; 20th United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright; a political aide, Leon G. Billings; and one of Muskie&#x27;s sons, Stephen.

== Legacy ==

=== Historical evaluations ===

Historical evaluations of Edmund Muskie focus on the impact his actions and legislation had in the United States and the greater world. His accomplishments in his home state have had him noted as one of the most influential politicians in the history of Maine. Depending on the metric he is coupled with Hannibal Hamlin and James Blaine as the three most important politicians from Maine. Muskie occupied all offices available in the Maine political system excluding state senator and United States representative. His political status in Maine is generally perceived favorably. During his four-year term as Governor of Maine he initiated a constitutional amendment, invested heavily in infrastructure, and institutionalized economic development—effectively bringing Maine into the Golden Age of Capitalism. Muskie ended the &quot;as Maine goes, so goes the nation&quot; political sentiment in the United States by moving Maine&#x27;s general election date to November instead of September. He preserved the cultural integrity of the state by endowing the Maine State Museum which was seen as critical to his public perception. Although economic expansionism was historically seen negatively by the people of Maine, Muskie&#x27;s policies were seen favorably as they were coupled with environmental provisions. His advocation for minimum wage increases, increased labor protections, and sales tax exemptions boosted consumer spending. Muskie has been widely characterized as the catalyst for the political renaissance of the Democratic Party in Maine. His election to the governorship signaled a fracturing of the Republican Party in the state and nearly tripled the number of Democrats in Maine between 1954 and 1974.

Since Muskie left office as the U.S. Secretary of State, writers, historians, scholars, political analysts and the general public have debated his legacy. Particular emphasis is placed on his impact in the environmentalist and civil rights movement; bureaucratic advancement, and diplomacy. Overall supporters of Muskie point to an expansion of environmental protection, preservation, and security. Numerous historians have noted him as &quot;the father of the 1960s environmental movement in America&quot;. His accomplishments in environmentalism established two of the foremost measures in U.S. environmental policy: the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1972 and 1977 and Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 and 1977. His contributions to the Clean Air Act were so great that the bill was nicknamed the &quot;Muskie Act&quot;. These two laws have been credited as the first major step to launching the wider environmentalism movement both in the U.S. and to some extent, the rest of the Free World. Harvard University law professor Richard Lazarus summarized Muskie&#x27;s legislative legacy with the following:

Senator Muskie&#x27;s environmental law legacy is no less than stunning in terms of positive impact on the nation&#x27;s natural environment. It takes little imagination to speculate what our national landscape would now look like if the economic growth we witnessed in the past four decades had not been accompanied by the environmental protections for air, land, and water provided by the laws that Senator Muskie championed in the 1970s. 

Muskie&#x27;s influence on American diplomacy was detailed by the Office of the Historian with the following: &quot;In the nine months Muskie served as Secretary of State, he conducted the first high-level meeting with the Soviet government after its December 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. During these negotiations, Secretary Muskie unsuccessfully attempted to secure the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. [He] also assisted President Carter in the implementation of the &quot;Carter Doctrine&quot;, which aimed to limit Soviet expansion into the Middle East and Persian Gulf. Finally, under Muskie&#x27;s leadership, the State Department negotiated the release of the remaining American hostages held by Iran.&quot; Many political commentators believed the bestowing of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Carter to be an affirmation of this assertion.

The public perception of his civil rights advancement has endured. A champion of the civil rights movement in the United States, he publicly criticized J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was at the time considered political suicide as Hoover often spied and attempted to smear his opponents. Muskie also was instrumental in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the creation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and developed the reform of lobbying. His time as the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee from 1975 to 1980 include the formation of the United States budget process. Because of this, he is known as the &quot;father of the federal budget process&quot;. David Broder of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, noted that Muskie&#x27;s leadership of the Senate&#x27;s intergovernmental relations subcommittee was, in part, responsible for countering Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Presidency&quot; and advancing &quot;New Federalism&quot;.

=== Public and political image ===
Muskie&#x27;s early political career was helped by his physical appearance. Voters could relate to his public persona in ways that translated to relatively high voter turnout. R. W. Apple Jr. described Muskie as &quot;long-jawed and craggy-faced&quot; later noting that he &quot;looked like the typical New Englander [with] a classic Down East accent.&quot; Muskie&#x27;s height has variously been recorded as 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) to 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m). His height had him often compared to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and referred to by voters and media alike as &quot;Lincolnesque&quot;. He was often seen as &quot;towering over&quot; political candidates creating symbolic superiority and power.

Known as a recluse, he disliked public attention and media speculation. Voters often associated with his &quot;trademark directness, homespun integrity, and apolitical candor&quot;. However, political aides have described him as having a &quot;hot temper&quot; and being demanding. A notorious micro-manager, Muskie often required his aides to have &quot;every speech and every position researched, analyzed and reported directly back to him.&quot; While reserved and polite in public, when roused, it was reported that Muskie &quot;had the vocabulary of a sailor&quot;. His ability to command an argument was taken positively by voters as it signaled good leadership ability. Political opponents noted his &quot;cutting intellect&quot; as in-conducive to lengthy debates and voters noted it as a good quality to possess when negotiating with foreign leaders. An official publication by Cornell University commented on his political image by saying: &quot;he will be remembered for the quality of his mind; the toughness, the rigor, the common sense; and for another quality: the courage to take risks for what he saw as right&quot;.

Known to be punctual, he was present 90% of Senate roll-call votes. Although he was portrayed as socially rigid, he often broke from this mold and showed a personable side. While campaigning in cities, he often let students from the crowd run up to the stage and present a case for policy reform, unheard of at the time.

===Internship Program===
The Edmund S. Muskie Internship Program is a professional exchange program supported by the United States Department of State. It provides summer internship placements, career training, and financial support to Eurasian scholars and graduate students studying in the United States. The program was established by the United States Congress in 1992 fiscal year (, Sec. 227) and was named by the Freedom Support Act of 1992 (, Sec. 801). The Muskie program with a renewed format and scope was launched by Cultural Vistas in 2015. In the past, the program was administered by International Research &amp; Exchanges Board and American Council of Teachers of Russian/American Council for Collaboration in Education and Language.

=== Honors and memorials ===
He was awarded the Guardian of Berlin&#x27;s Freedom Award from the U.S. Army Berlin Command in 1961. In 1969, he was inducted in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences alongside Ted Kennedy, George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Shirley Chisholm, and Bella Abzug.

At the conclusion of his political career, he held the highest political office by a Polish American in U.S. history, and also was the only Polish American ever nominated by a major party for vice president. On the 100th birthday of Edmund Muskie, U.S. Senator Angus King spoke on the floor of the United States Senate in memoriam. King noted the following: &quot;if you would see Ed Muskie&#x27;s memorial, look around you. Take a deep breath. Experience our great rivers. Experience the environment that we now have in the country that we treasure.&quot; Muskie received the keys to all three major cities in Maine: Portland, Lewiston, and Augusta. He was given honorary citizenship to the State of Texas in 1968. Numerous days have been named &quot;Edmund S. Muskie Day&quot;: September 25, 1968 (Michigan), January 20, 1980 (New York), March 28, 1988 (Maine), March 1928, 1994 (Maine), and March 20, 1995 (Maine). In 1987, the Maine State Legislature enacted Statute §A7 enacting &quot;Edmund S. Muskie Day&quot; on March 28. The statute was amended in 1989; Edmund S. Muskie Day is celebrated annually and is a public holiday in Maine.
Muskie was given honorary degrees from Portland University (1955), Suffolk University (1955), University of Maine (1956), University of Buffalo (1960), Saint Francis College (1961), Nasson College (1962), Hanover College (1967), Syracuse University (1969), Boston University (1969), John Carroll University (1969), Notre Dame University (1969), Middlebury College (1969), Providence College (1969), University of Maryland (1969), George Washington University (1969), Northeastern University (1969), College of William and Mary (1970), Ricker College (1970), St. Joseph&#x27;s College (1970), University of New Hampshire (1970), St. Anselm College (1970), Washington and Jefferson College (1971), Rivier College (1971), Thomas College (1973), Husson College (1974), Unity College (1975), Marquette University (1982), Rutgers University (1986), Bates College (1986), Washington College (1987), and University of Southern Maine (1992).

Muskie was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom—the nation&#x27;s highest honor—by President Jimmy Carter on January 16, 1981, for his work during the Iran hostage crisis, four days before stepping down from the presidency. In 1984, the House of Representatives designated the Edmund S. Muskie Federal Building in Augusta.

The American Bar Association honors lawyers who undertake &quot;pro bono&quot; work with the annual Edmund S. Muskie Pro Bono Service Award. From 1993 to 2013, the United States Department of State ran the Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Fellowship Program in an effort to increase international study abroad. In 1996, the Edmund S. Muskie Distinguished Public Service Award was founded by the Truman National Security Project to honor current or former elected officials.
The Edmund S. Muskie School of Public Service at the University of Southern Maine was named in his honor in 1990. Muskie&#x27;s papers and personal effects are kept at the Edmund S. Muskie Archives and Special Collections Library at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.

<doc id="307966" wikidata="Q1383137" url="?curid=307966" title="William E. Miller">
<text>William Edward Miller (March 22, 1914 – June 24, 1983) was an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from New York as a Republican. During the 1964 presidential election, he was the Republican nominee for vice president, the first Catholic nominated for the office by the Republican Party.

A native of Lockport, New York, Miller graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1935, and from Albany Law School in 1938, afterwards becoming an attorney in Lockport. In 1942, he was appointed a commissioner for the U.S. District Court in Buffalo, New York. Miller served in the United States Army during World War II – first as a member of an intelligence unit in Richmond, Virginia, and then as a prosecutor of Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg trials.

Miller was an assistant district attorney in Niagara County, New York, from 1946 to 1948. In January 1948, the district attorney&#x27;s position became vacant, and the governor of New York appointed Miller. Miller was elected to a full term later that year, and served as district attorney until January 1951, when he resigned.

In 1950, Miller was a successful Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives. He was re-elected six times, and served from January 1951 until January 1965. In 1960, he was selected to lead the National Republican Congressional Committee, and led Republicans to gain more than 20 seats in that year&#x27;s elections. In 1961, he became chairman of the Republican National Committee, a position he used to advocate for the party to become more conservative. In 1964, Miller was selected as the Republican nominee for vice president. The ticket of Senator Barry Goldwater and Miller for vice president lost to the Democratic nominees, President Lyndon Johnson and Senator Hubert Humphrey.

After leaving Congress, Miller resumed practicing law in Lockport. He died in Buffalo on June 24, 1983, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life and education==
William Edward Miller was born in Lockport, New York on March 22, 1914, a son of Elizabeth Hinch and Edward J. Miller. He attended the parochial schools of Lockport, and graduated from Lockport High School in 1931. Miller attended the University of Notre Dame, where he graduated with a B.A. in 1935, and Albany Law School, from which he graduated with an LL.B. in 1938. He was admitted to the bar in 1938, and practiced in Lockport. In 1942, Miller was appointed a commissioner for the U.S. District Court in Buffalo.

== Career ==
===Military service===
Miller enlisted in the United States Army on July 1, 1942, and received training in the Military Intelligence branch. After serving with an Intelligence unit in Richmond, Virginia, in May 1945, Miller received his commission as a first lieutenant and was assigned to the War Criminals Branch of the War Department staff. In August 1945, he was assigned as assistant prosecutor of Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg trials. Miller was discharged in March 1946, and returned to Lockport.

===Politics===
====District attorney====
Miller served as an assistant district attorney of Niagara County, New York from 1946 to 1948. Governor Thomas E. Dewey appointed Miller to fill a vacancy as district attorney in January 1948, and Miller won election to a full term in November. He served until resigning in January 1951 as he prepared to assume his seat in Congress.

====Congressman====
In August 1950, Miller won the Republican nomination in New York&#x27;s 42nd Congressional district after defeating Melvin L. Payne and James W. Heary in a primary. He won the general election in November by defeating the Democratic nominee, Mary Louise Nice.

After redistricting placed Miller in New York&#x27;s 40th Congressional District, he was easily reelected every two years from 1952 to 1962. He rose through seniority to become the second-ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and received credit for two major pieces of legislation. The first was a compromise on the development of Niagara Falls hydroelectric power, and the second was a law authorizing construction of a new Lake Erie‐Lake Ontario canal east of the Niagara River. Miller voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Miller became influential with respect to the internal workings of the House. In 1959, he took part in the Republican caucus&#x27; action to replace Minority Leader (and former Speaker) Joseph W. Martin Jr. with Charles Halleck. Republicans had lost House seats in the 1958 election, and decided to replace the moderate Martin with the more conservative Halleck. In 1960, Miller won election as head of the National Republican Congressional Committee. In the November election, the party gained 22 House seats, an achievement that was notable because it occurred as Republicans were losing the presidential election.

====Republican National Committee====
Miller&#x27;s success with the 1960 House elections led to his selection as head of the Republican National Committee. He served from 1961 to 1964, and advocated for the party to become more conservative, including tacitly supporting Goldwater for the 1964 presidential nomination.

As chairman, Miller oversaw the party&#x27;s efforts during the 1962 Congressional elections. Though Republicans lost five seats in the Senate, they gained four in the House. In addition, Democratic candidates in several races throughout the South experienced tougher than expected races, indicating that the domination the Democrats had enjoyed regionally since the Civil War was in peril. These included the moderate-to-liberal Senator J. Lister Hill of Alabama, who defeated business Republican businessman James D. Martin by just 50.9 percent to 49.1. Martin&#x27;s strong showing demonstrated his viability as a candidate, and in 1964 he was elected to the U.S. House.

In the early 1960s, leading Republicans including Miller and Senator Barry Goldwater began advocating for a plan they called the Southern Strategy, an effort to make Republican gains in the Solid South, which had been pro-Democratic since the American Civil War. Under the Southern Strategy, Republicans would continue an earlier effort to make inroads in the South, Operation Dixie, by ending attempts to appeal to African American voters in the Northern states, and instead appeal to white conservative voters in the South. As documented by reporters and columnists including Joseph Alsop and Arthur Krock, on the surface the Southern Strategy would appeal to white voters in the South by advocating against the New Frontier programs of President John F. Kennedy and in favor of a smaller federal government and states&#x27; rights, while less publicly arguing against the Civil Rights movement and in favor of continued racial segregation.

Miller concurred with Goldwater, and backed the Southern Strategy, including holding private meetings of the RNC and other key Republican leaders in late 1962 and early 1963 so they could decide whether to implement it. Overruling the moderate and liberal wings of the party, its leadership decided to pursue the Southern Strategy for the 1964 elections and beyond.

====Vice presidential candidate====

After winning the Republican presidential nomination, Goldwater chose Miller to be his running mate. In Goldwater&#x27;s telling, he picked Miller because &quot;he drives Johnson nuts&quot; with his Republican activism. But by some other accounts, Johnson &quot;was barely aware of Miller&#x27;s existence.&quot; Miller&#x27;s Eastern roots and Catholic faith balanced the ticket in some ways, but ideologically he was conservative like Goldwater. His relative obscurity—&quot;he was better known for snipes at President Kennedy than for anything else&quot;—gave birth to the refrain &quot;Here&#x27;s a riddle, it&#x27;s a killer / Who the hell is William Miller?&quot;

In the general election, incumbent Lyndon Johnson won a landslide victory. The Goldwater/Miller ticket carried only six states − Goldwater&#x27;s home state of Arizona, plus Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and South Carolina. Despite the defeat, the ticket&#x27;s inroads into the previously Solid South were seen as an indication that the Southern Strategy was viable, and Republicans continued to pursue it in subsequent campaigns.

===Later life===
Following the defeat of the Goldwater–Miller ticket, Miller returned to his hometown of Lockport, New York, where he resumed his law practice. He also appeared in one of the first &quot;Do you know me?&quot; commercials for American Express. Mark Z. Barabak later wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that by the time he died, Miller was &quot;better known for his advertising appearance than his years in Congress.&quot;

He participated in an interview in 1979 in which he stated that he did not miss politics as he had &quot;had such a saturation of it in my life&quot;.

On June 5, 1983, he was admitted to Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital in Williamsville, New York, for diagnostic tests. He suffered a stroke in mid-June and died in Buffalo, New York, on June 24, 1983. Miller was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. In noting Miller&#x27;s passing, Goldwater stated &quot;he was one of the greatest men I have ever known and I feel his loss very deeply&quot;.

==Personal life==
Miller and his wife, Stephanie (Wagner) (1923–2023) were the parents of three daughters and a son. Their youngest daughter, Stephanie Miller, was a stand-up comedian in the 1980s, and CNBC late night TV host in the 1990s. Since 2004 she has hosted a nationally syndicated politically liberal radio talk show based in Los Angeles. Their son, William E. Miller Jr., was the unsuccessful 1992 and 1994 Republican nominee in New York&#x27;s 29th congressional district.

<text>Hoodening (), also spelled hodening and oodening, is a folk custom found in Kent, a county in South East England. The tradition entails the use of a wooden hobby horse known as a hooden horse that is mounted on a pole and carried by a person hidden under a sackcloth. Originally, the tradition was restricted to the area of East Kent, although in the twentieth century it spread into neighbouring West Kent. It represents a regional variation of a &quot;hooded animal&quot; tradition that appears in various forms throughout Britain and Ireland.

As recorded from the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries, hoodening was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of farm labourers. They would form into teams to accompany the hooden horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included someone to carry the horse, a leader, a man in female clothing known as a &quot;Mollie&quot;, and several musicians. The team would then carry the hooden horse to local houses and shops, where they would expect payment for their appearance. Although this practice is extinct, in the present the hooden horse is incorporated into various Kentish mummers plays and Morris dances that take place at different times of the year.

The origins of the hoodening tradition, and the original derivation of the term &quot;hooden&quot;, remain subject to academic debate. An early suggestion was that &quot;hooden&quot; was related to the Anglo-Saxon pre-Christian god Woden (Odin), and that the tradition therefore originated with pre-Christian religious practices in the early medieval Kingdom of Kent. This idea has not found support from historians or folklorists studying the tradition. A more widely accepted explanation among scholars is that the term &quot;hooden&quot; relates to &quot;hooded&quot;, a reference to the sackcloth worn by the person carrying the horse. The absence of late medieval references to such practices and the geographic dispersal of the various British hooded animal traditions—among them the Mari Lwyd of south Wales, the Broad of the Cotswolds, and the Old Ball, Old Tup, and Old Horse of northern England—have led to suggestions that they derive from the regionalised popularisation of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century fashion for hobby horses among the social elite.

The earliest textual reference to the hoodening tradition comes from the first half of the eighteenth century. Scattered references to it appeared over the next century and a half, many of which considered it to be a declining tradition that had died out in many parts of Kent. Aware of this decline, in the early twentieth century the folklorist and historian Percy Maylam documented what survived of the tradition and traced its appearances in historical documents, publishing his findings as &quot;The Hooden Horse&quot; in 1909. Although deemed extinct at the time of the First World War, the custom was revived in an altered form during the mid-twentieth century, when the use of the hooden horse was incorporated into some modern Kentish folk traditions.

==Description==
Surviving sources testify to the fact that while there was some variation in the hoodening tradition as it was practised by various people in different parts of East Kent, it was nevertheless &quot;on the whole remarkably uniform&quot;. The hooden horse, which was at the centre of the tradition, was usually made out of a wooden horse&#x27;s head affixed to a pole about four feet long, with a hinged jaw that was moved by a string. This horse was then carried aloft by a person concealed beneath a dark cloth. 

As part of the hoodening custom, a team of &quot;hoodeners&quot;, consisting of between four and eight men, would carry the horse through the streets. This team included the horse operator, a &quot;Groom&quot;, &quot;Driver&quot;, or &quot;Waggoner&quot; who carried a whip and led the horse by a bridle, a &quot;Jockey&quot; who would attempt to mount the horse, a &quot;Mollie&quot; who was a man dressed as a woman, and one or two musicians. All of the men were farm labourers, usually being those who worked with horses.

The team performed the custom at Christmas time, and usually on Christmas Eve. The team would arrive at people&#x27;s houses where they would sing a song before being admitted entry. Once inside, the horse pranced and gnashed its jaw, while the Jockey attempted to mount it, and the Mollie swept the floor with a broom while chasing any girls present. Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols. Upon being presented with payment, the team would leave to repeat the process at another house.

==Regional distribution==

Historians have catalogued 33 recorded instances of the hoodening tradition extant in Kent prior to the twentieth-century revival. These are clustered in a crescent shape along the eastern and northern coasts of the county, and all were found within the area historically defined as East Kent, the tradition being unknown in neighbouring West Kent. More specifically, the folklorist Percy Maylam noted that there were no records of the tradition having been found west of Godmersham. 

This region was &quot;a well populated area&quot; during the period in which the hoodeners were active, and Maylam noted that all of the areas in which the tradition was found contained the East Kentish dialect. The folklorist E. C. Cawte analysed the historical distribution of the hoodeners and found that it did not correspond with the areas of early Anglo-Saxon settlement in Kent, nor did it accord with the county&#x27;s coal mining areas. He concluded that &quot;there is no apparent reason why the custom did not spread further afield&quot;.

Hoodening was part of a wider &quot;hooded animal&quot; tradition that Cawte identified in various forms across Britain. Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women&#x27;s clothing. In South Wales, the Mari Lwyd tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over the Christmas period. In an area along the border between Derbyshire and Yorkshire, the Old Tup tradition featured groups knocking on doors around Christmas carrying a hobby horse that had a goat&#x27;s head. The folklorist Christina Hole drew parallels between hoodening and the Christmas Bull tradition recorded in Dorset and Gloucestershire. In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions—the Padstow &#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss festival and Minehead Hobby Horse—which take place not at Christmas time but on May Day. 

Although the origins of these &quot;hooded animal&quot; traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England&#x27;s Morris dance tradition, which became a &quot;nation-wide craze&quot; in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into &quot;a set of sharply delineated regional traditions&quot;.

==Etymology and origins==

Maylam noted that most nineteenth-century sources describing the tradition had spelled the word as &quot;hoden&quot;, but that he favoured &quot;hooden&quot; because it better reflected the pronunciation of the word with its long vowel. He added that &quot;the word &#x27;hooden&#x27; rhymes with &#x27;wooden&#x27; and not with &#x27;sodden&#x27; as some writers appear to think&quot;. Given this pronunciation, Cawte suggested that &quot;oodening&quot; was a better spelling for the tradition&#x27;s name. Maylam also noted that none of the hoodeners with whom he communicated were aware of the etymology of the term, and that similarly they were unaware of the tradition&#x27;s historical origins.

The term &quot;hoodening&quot; is thus of unknown derivation. One possible explanation for the origin of &quot;hooden&quot; was that it had emerged as a mispronunciation of &quot;wooden&quot;, referring to the use of the wooden horse. Maylam was critical of this idea, expressing the view that such a mispronunciation was unlikely to emerge from the Kentish dialect. A second possibility is that the name &quot;hooden&quot; was a reference to the hooded nature of the horse&#x27;s bearer. The historian Ronald Hutton deemed this to be the &quot;simplest&quot; derivation, while folklorists Cawte and Charlotte Sophia Burne also considered it the most likely explanation. Maylam was also critical of this, suggesting that the cloth under which the carrier was concealed was too large to be considered a hood. In his &quot;History of Kent&quot; the antiquarian Alfred John Dunkin suggested that &quot;Hodening&quot; was a corruption of &quot;Hobening&quot;, and that it was ultimately derived from the Gothic &quot;hopp&quot;, meaning horse. Maylam opined that Dunkin&#x27;s argument could be &quot;ignored&quot;, stating that it rested on the erroneous assumption that &quot;Hodening&quot; began with a short vowel.

Maylam concluded that the hoodening tradition was &quot;a mutilated survival&quot; of a form of Morris dance. Noting that some medieval Morris dancers had incorporated games devoted to the English folk hero Robin Hood into their custom, he suggested that &quot;hoodening&quot; might have originally been a reference to Robin Hood. This idea was challenged by Burne, who noted that in his legends, Robin Hood was always depicted as an archer rather than a horse-rider, thus questioning how he had come to be associated with the hooden horse. She further noted that the medieval games devoted to Robin Hood all took place in May rather than at Christmas, as hoodening did. Cawte also criticised Maylam&#x27;s argument, noting that there was no evidence of Morris dancing in Kent prior to the twentieth century, and that neither hoodening nor Robin Hood had a particularly close association with the Morris dance to start with.

===Possible Early Medieval origins===
In 1807 an anonymous observer suggested that the term &quot;hoden&quot; was linked to the Anglo-Saxon god Woden, and that the tradition might be &quot;a relic of a festival to commemorate our Saxon ancestors landing in Thanet&quot;. In 1891 it was suggested that the custom had once been known as &quot;Odining&quot;, a reference to the early medieval Scandinavian god Odin. The author of this idea further suggested that the custom had begun either with the ritual wearing of the skins of horses sacrificed to Odin, or as an early Christian mockery of such Odinic practices.

Maylam noted that he was initially attracted to the idea that the term &quot;hodening&quot; had derived from &quot;Woden&quot;—an Old English name that he thought a more likely origin than the Old Norse &quot;Odin&quot;—but that upon investigating this possibility found &quot;no sufficient evidence&quot; for it. He added that it would seem unlikely that the &quot;W&quot; would be lost from &quot;Woden&quot; in the Kentish dialect, citing the example of Woodnesborough, a Kentish village whose name is often interpreted as having derived from &quot;Woden&quot; and which clearly retains its use of &quot;W&quot;. He concluded that &quot;one feels that the theory is based on inferences and analogies not strong enough for a foundation to carry the building erected on them&quot;. The idea of linking the tradition to Woden was also dismissed as unlikely by both Burne and Cawte.

Believing it likely that the hoodening tradition &quot;substantially pre-dates&quot; its earliest textual appearances, the folklorist Geoff Doel suggested the possibility that it had originated as a Midwinter rite to re-energise the vegetation. As evidence for this claim, Doel noted that other English winter folk customs, such as the Apple Wassail, have also been interpreted in this manner. He also suggested that the use of the horse in the tradition may have some connections to either the use of the white horse as the symbol of Kent, and the use of Hengist and Horsa (literally &quot;stallion&quot; and &quot;horse&quot; in Old English) as prominent characters in the origin myths of the early medieval Kingdom of Kent. However, the white horse did not become commonly associated with Kent until the beginning of the eighteenth century, and James Lloyd regards any suggestion of an ancient connection with hoodening as &quot;wishful thinking and in defiance of all historical evidence&quot;.

==Recorded appearances==
===Early textual references===
The oldest known textual reference to hoodening comes from the &quot;Alphabet of Kenticisms&quot;, a manuscript authored by Samuel Pegge, an antiquary who served as the vicar of Godmersham in Kent from 1731 to 1751. After Pegge died, the manuscript was obtained by the palaeographer Sir Frederic Madden, and after his death it was purchased by the English Dialect Society, who published it in 1876. In this manuscript Pegge noted simply that &quot;Hoodening (huod.ing) is a country masquerade at Christmas times&quot;, comparing it to mumming and the Winster Guisers of Derbyshire.

The earliest known textual description of the tradition is provided by a letter that was published in a May 1807 edition of &quot;European Magazine&quot;. The letter, written anonymously, described an encounter with the hoodeners on a visit to the Kentish coastal town of Ramsgate in Thanet:
Later commenting on this source, Maylam highlighted that its author did not appear to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse&#x27;s skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse&#x27;s head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse&#x27;s skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.

The anonymously authored account was repeated almost verbatim in a range of other publications in the coming decades, giving its description far wider exposure. The first printed reference to the hooden horse having a wooden head appeared in Mackenzie E. C. Walcott&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the Coast of Kent&quot;, published in 1859, where he referred to a &quot;curious custom [which] used to prevail&quot; in Ramsgate. Maylam later suggested that the Ramsgate hooden horse tradition died out between 1807 and 1838, for he had interviewed elderly town residents in the early twentieth century and while several were aware that it had once taken place in the town, none could recall it happening in their own lifetime.

===Later nineteenth century===
Many years after the event, the Kentish antiquarian J. Meadows Cooper related that while sitting in a pub on the outskirts of Margate on Boxing Day 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered the building. Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child she had lived at a house named Updown, near Margate, and that she remembered the hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865. 

Maylam&#x27;s researches also found recollections of a hooden horse that had appeared in Herne and Swalecliffe but which had been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in Harbledown during the 1850s, and one that had been active at Evington but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at Lower Hardres that had been active from at least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892. In a January 1868 edition of the &quot;Kentish Gazette&quot;, an anonymous author mentioned that hoodening had taken place in Minster, Swale, on the Christmas Eve of 1867. The author noted that the tradition featured carol singing and the ringing of handbells, which were accompanied by the appearance of a hooden horse; they expressed surprise at this latter event because they had thought that the horse was &quot;as extinct as the megatherium&quot;.

In their 1888 &quot;Dictionary of the Kentish Dialect&quot;, W. D. Parish and W. F. Shaw claimed that &quot;Hodening&quot; was a term used in Kent to refer to a custom involving the singing of carols, but that in the past &quot;Hoodening&quot; had been applied to &quot;a mumming or masquerade&quot; involving the hooden horse. They added that they had gained information on this older custom in 1876 from the Reverend H. Bennett Smith of St Nicholas-at-Wade, who had in turn learned from a retired farmer in his parish that &quot;the farmer used to send annually round the neighbourhood the best horse under the charge of the wagoner, and that afterwards instead, a man used to represent the horse, being supplied with a tail, and with a wooden figure of a horse&#x27;s head, and plenty of horse hair for a mane... The custom has long since ceased.&quot;

Parish and Shaw did not mention what time of year the tradition took place or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying at the time of writing. Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.

In December 1889 a letter written by a resident of St. Lawrence named Charles J. H. Saunders appeared in the &quot;Bromley Record&quot;. Saunders said he had conversed with many elderly residents of Thanet on the subject of hoodening, and that they informed him that the custom had been discontinued around fifty years previously, after a woman in Broadstairs was so scared by the hooden horse that she died. He added that a horse&#x27;s skull was rarely used, &quot;owing to the difficulty procuring one&quot;, and that the wooden head was thus typically used as a replacement. He said the hoodening company typically consisted of a &quot;Jockey&quot; who placed himself on the back of the person carrying the horse, and that it was the &quot;sport&quot; that bystanders attempted to throw him off, resulting in violence. The horse and jockey were also accompanied by two singers, two attendants, and someone dressed as an &quot;old woman&quot; carrying a broom; when the company knocked on people&#x27;s doors, it was the old woman&#x27;s job to sweep the inhabitants feet away with her broom and to chase any girls until being paid off with money or refreshments. He was of the opinion that the custom had been restricted to the Isle of Thanet, noting that locals informed him that it had been carried out in Ramsgate, St. Lawrence, Minster, St. Nicholas, Acol, Monkton, and Birchington. Contradicting this were several letters published in the &quot;Church Times&quot; in January 1891 which attested to the continuing practice of the hooden horse tradition at both Deal and Walmer.

===Percy Maylam&#x27;s investigations===
Percy Maylam was born into a farming family in 1865 at Pivington Farm in Pluckley and, in 1890, became a solicitor of the Supreme Court before working as a solicitor at Canterbury. As well as being a keen cricketer and coin collector, Maylam was an amateur historian and in 1892 joined the Kent Archaeological Society. During the 1880s, Maylam came upon the hoodening tradition and began undertaking research into it, searching for textual references to the tradition in books, periodicals, and newspapers, and interviewing those involved in three extant traditions, at St Nicholas-at-Wade, Walmer, and Deal. He expressed the opinion that &quot;in these days Kent possesses so few genuine popular customs of this kind that we cannot afford to be indifferent to those still in existence. This is my excuse for my attempt to record the custom as now existing before it is utterly lost to us.&quot;
The period in which Maylam conducted his research was one that was witnessing increased interest in the recording of Britain&#x27;s rural folk culture, in particular by members of the professional classes—of which Maylam was a member—in part due to the fear that such traditions were rapidly dying out. Such folklore collecting was encouraged by The Folklore Society, with whom Maylam was associated, and also by the widely read book &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, a work of comparative folkloristics authored by the anthropologist James Frazer. Maylam published his research in 1909 as &quot;The Hooden Horse&quot;, in an edition limited to 303 copies. The book was reviewed in the journal &quot;Folklore&quot; by Burne, who described it as &quot;an admirable piece of work, careful, thorough, unambitious, and complete in itself&quot;. Cawte later described it as &quot;unusually good&quot;, while Fran and Geoff Doel regarded it as &quot;a very enlightened piece of Edwardian folk research&quot;.

Maylam concluded that at the time, there was only one hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington, and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam&#x27;s benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians—one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina—and a man named Robert Laming who led the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner&#x27;s daughter placed a gratuity in the horse&#x27;s mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.
Maylam also interviewed those involved in the hoodening tradition at Deal, whom he encountered in the summer of 1909. One elderly gentleman, Robert Skardon, related that his father had once led the town&#x27;s hoodening troupe, in which he personally carried the head, his father the drum, his &quot;Uncle John Beaney&quot; the fiddle, and &quot;old Harry Chorner&quot; the piccolo. For many years they had included a man dressed in woman&#x27;s clothing, who was known as a &quot;Daisy&quot; rather than a &quot;Mollie&quot;, but that this had been discontinued. Skardon had given up the tradition many years previously, and the hooden horse itself had come into the possession of Elbridge Bowles of Great Mongeham, who continued to lead a hoodening troupe after Christmas each year, visiting Deal as well as the neighbouring villages of Finglesham, Ripple, Tilmanstone, Eastry, and Betteshanger. Maylam was also informed that at the time of Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Second Boer War, the horse had been decorated with military equipment. The fourth hooden horse that Maylam encountered was owned by the men who worked at George Goodson&#x27;s farm in Fenland, Word, near Sandwich. They informed him that it had been made by a farm hand in Cleve, Monkton, before being brought to Word when one of the Cleve farm workers relocated there.

Maylam believed that the custom—as a &quot;natural and spontaneous observance&quot; among the people—was clearly going to die out, expressing his hope that the hooden horses could be preserved in Kentish museums and brought out for specially arranged public processions so as to maintain their place in Kentish culture. In later life, Maylam focused his attentions on exploring his family history, privately publishing &quot;Maylam Family Records&quot; in 1932, before dying in 1939. In the century following his death Maylam&#x27;s book on hoodening became difficult to obtain and expensive to purchase, and so to mark the centenary of its first publication, it was republished in 2009 by The History Press, under the altered title of &quot;The Kent Hooden Horse&quot;. Writing an introductory article for the second publication, Doel, a specialist in Kentish folklore, praised Maylam&#x27;s book as a &quot;classic study&quot; which was &quot;impressive for its separation of fact from speculation as to the origins and significance of the custom.&quot;

===Twentieth-century revival===
Writing in 1967, the folklorist Barnett Field claimed that at some point after Maylam&#x27;s book was published, hoodening had &quot;died out. The Horses were hung up in the stables, and when the tractors came, were taken out and burnt on the bonfire.&quot; Doel and Doel later suggested that it was the impact of the First World War which effectively ended the tradition. Field noted that the first revival of the custom after the war took place at the 1936 Kent District Folk-Dance Festival at Aylesford. A new horse was specially created for this festival, and was modelled on an older example that had been used at Sarre. The hobby horse had not previously had any connection with Morris dancing, although was adopted as a totem animal for several Morris sides after the Second World War. This revival in the usage of the horse was heavily influenced by Maylam&#x27;s book. 

The Aylesford horse was adopted by the Ravensbourne Morris Men, a Morris troupe based in the West Kentish village of Keston, in 1947. The Ravensbourne Morris&#x27;s hoodening tradition is the earliest known variant of the custom to exist in West Kent, although there are accounts of a hooden horse being located at Balgowan School in the West Kentish town of Beckenham during the 1930s. At the 1945 celebration marking British victory in the Second World War, a horse was brought out in Acol; this instance has been described as &quot;a kind of missing link between tradition and revival&quot; because the horse had been used as part of the historical hoodening tradition up until the mid-1920s.

Barnett Field (1912–2000) was born at Wych Cross in the Ashdown Forest and subsequently educated at Tunbridge Wells. He trained as a banker before working as manager of the Hythe and Folkestone branches of the Westminster Bank until his retirement in 1979. Field and his wife, Olive Ridley, had a keen interest in folk dances; she established the Folkestone National Folk Dance Group in 1950, and he founded the East Kent Morris Men in 1953. Field constructed a hooden horse for the group to use, based in large part on the Deal horse photographed for Maylam&#x27;s book, and unveiled it at the Folkestone celebrations for the coronation of Elizabeth II in June 1953. After this, it came to be used by both the East Kent Morris Men and the Folkestone District National Dance Group&#x27;s Handbell Ringers, who took it with them for performances in various parts of continental Europe, including Austria, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia, developing what came to be known as &quot;handbell hoodening&quot;. The Handbell Ringers also brought out the horse to accompany them as they went around in public collecting money for charity at Christmas time.

From 1954, the horse was also brought out for a Whitsun celebration in which it was paraded from Charing to the village green at Wye. A special service was held in the Charing Church, in which the Morris Men danced in the chancel and through the aisle, while the vicar put a bridle on the horse itself. The horse was also brought out for a July 1956 ceremony in which The Swan Inn, a pub at Wickhambreaux, was officially renamed as The Hooden Horse; present were the East Kent Morris Men, the Handbell Ringers, and the Ravensbourne Morris Men. This venture led to the groups establishing a new folk custom, &quot;hop hoodening&quot;, which was derived in part from an older hop-picking ceremony found in the Weald area. Their new custom involved the different groups joining together on a tour around the villages of East Kent, beginning at Canterbury Cathedral and going through Ramsgate, Cliftonville, and Herne Bay before ending in a barn dance at Wickhambreaux.

In October 1957 Field was introduced to Jack Laming of Walmer, who as a boy had performed in a hoodening troupe earlier in the century. Laming taught Field more about the historical hoodening tradition, and together they unearthed an old hooden horse that was stored at Walmer&#x27;s Coldblow Farm; this artefact was later placed on display at Deal Maritime and Local History Museum. In June 1961 Field and his wife established the first Folkestone International Folklore Festival as a biannual celebration of folk customs; it continued for 28 years.

Since the end of the Second World War, the hooden horse&#x27;s use has been revived in Whitstable, where it is often brought out for the Jack in the Green festival each May, and is owned by a group called the Ancient Order of Hoodeners. Since 1981, the Tonbridge Mummers and Hoodeners have made use of a horse, incorporating it into a play specially written for the purpose by Doel and Nick Miller.
An annual conference of hoodeners was also established; initially meeting at the Marsh Gate Inn near Herne Bay, it subsequently moved to Simple Simon&#x27;s in Canterbury. A member of the St. Nicholas-at-Wade hoodeners, Ben Jones, established a website devoted to the tradition. At the prompting of local residents, in December 2014 a new Hungry Horse location on the corner of Haine Road and Nash Road in Broadstairs was named the Hooden Horse after the folk custom. Commenting on the Kentish revival of hoodening, Hutton suggested that its success was due largely to the desire of many Kentish folk to culturally distinguish themselves from neighbouring London.

<doc id="307968" wikidata="Q2566489" url="?curid=307968" title="Biblical cosmology">
<text>Biblical cosmology is the biblical writers&#x27; conception of the cosmos as an organised, structured entity, including its origin, order, meaning and destiny. The Bible was formed over many centuries, involving many authors, and reflects shifting patterns of religious belief; consequently, its cosmology is not always consistent. Nor do the biblical texts necessarily represent the beliefs of all Jews or Christians at the time they were put into writing: the majority of the texts making up the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament in particular represent the beliefs of only a small segment of the ancient Israelite community, the members of a late Judean religious tradition centered in Jerusalem and devoted to the exclusive worship of Yahweh.

The ancient Israelites envisaged the universe as a flat disc-shaped Earth floating on water, heaven above, underworld below. Humans inhabited Earth during life and the underworld after death; there was no way that mortals could enter heaven, and the underworld was morally neutral; only in Hellenistic times (after ) did Jews begin to adopt the Greek idea that it would be a place of punishment for misdeeds, and that the righteous would enjoy an afterlife in heaven. In this period too the older three-level cosmology in large measure gave way to the Greek concept of a spherical Earth suspended in space at the center of a number of concentric heavens.

The opening words of the Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1:1–26) sum up the biblical editors&#x27; view of how the cosmos originated: &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&quot;; Yahweh, the God of Israel, was solely responsible for creation and had no rivals, implying Israel&#x27;s superiority over all other nations.
Later Jewish thinkers, adopting ideas from Greek philosophy, concluded that God&#x27;s Wisdom, Word and Spirit penetrated all things and gave them unity. Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and identified Jesus with the Logos (Word): &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&quot; (John 1:1). Interpreting and producing expositions of biblical cosmology was formalized into a genre of writing among Christians and Jews called the Hexaemal literature. The genre entered into vogue in the second half of the fourth century, after it was introduced into Christian circles by the Hexaemeron of Basil of Caesarea.

=== Divine battle and divine speech ===
Two different models of the process of creation existed in ancient Israel. In the &quot;logos&quot; (speech) model, God speaks and shapes unresisting dormant matter into effective existence and order (Psalm 33: &quot;By the word of YHWH the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their hosts; he gathers up the waters like a mound, stores the Deep in vaults&quot;); in the second, or &quot;agon&quot; (struggle) model, God does battle with the monsters of the sea at the beginning of the world in order to mark his sovereignty and power. Psalm 74 evokes the agon model: it opens with a lament over God&#x27;s desertion of his people and their tribulations, then asks him to remember his past deeds: &quot;You it was who smashed Sea with your might, who battered the heads of the monsters in the waters; You it was who crushed the heads of Leviathan, who left them for food for the denizens of the desert...&quot; In this world-view the seas are primordial forces of disorder, and the work of creation is preceded by a divine combat (or &quot;theomachy&quot;).

Creation in the &quot;agon&quot; model takes the following storyline: (1) God as the divine warrior battles the monsters of chaos, who include Sea, Death, Tannin and Leviathan; (2) The world of nature joins in the battle and the chaos-monsters are defeated; (3) God is enthroned on a divine mountain, surrounded by lesser deities; (4) He speaks, and nature brings forth the created world, or for the Greeks, the cosmos. This myth was taken up in later Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature and projected into the future, so that the cosmic battle becomes the decisive act at the end of the world&#x27;s history: thus the Book of Revelation (end of the 1st century CE) tells how, after the God&#x27;s final victory over the sea-monsters, New Heavens and New Earth shall be inaugurated in a cosmos in which there will be &quot;no more sea&quot; (Revelation 21:1).

The Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1) is the quintessential &quot;logos&quot; creation myth. Like the &quot;agon&quot; model it begins with darkness and the uncreated primordial ocean: God separates and restrains the waters, but he does not create them from nothing. God initiates each creative act with a spoken word (&quot;God said, Let there be...&quot;), and finalises it with the giving of a name. Creation by speech is not unique to the Old Testament: it is prominent in some Egyptian traditions. There is, however, a difference between the Egyptian and Hebrew logos mythologies: in Genesis 1 the divine word of the Elohim is an act of &quot;making into&quot;; the word of Egyptian creator-god, by contrast, is an almost magical activation of something inherent in pre-creation: as such, it goes beyond the concept of fiat (divine act) to something more like the Logos of the Gospel of John.

=== Naming: God, Wisdom, Torah and Christ ===
In the ancient world, things did not exist until they were named: &quot;The name of a living being or an object was ... the very essence of what was defined, and the pronouncing of a name was to create what was spoken.&quot; The pre-Exilic (before 586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to Yahweh in heaven, despite the continued existence of an assembly of subordinate servant-deities who helped make decisions about matters on heaven and earth. The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition (e.g. the Book of Proverbs, Song of Songs, etc.) develop the idea that Wisdom, later identified with Torah, existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe: &quot;Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields.&quot; Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that God&#x27;s Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity. Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the Epistle to the Colossians calls Jesus &quot;...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation...&quot;, while the Gospel of John identifies him with the creative word (&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&quot;).

== Cosmography (shape and structure of the cosmos) ==

===Heavens, Earth, and underworld===
The Hebrew Bible depicted a three-part world, with the heavens (&quot;shamayim&quot;) above, Earth (&quot;eres&quot;) in the middle, and the underworld (&quot;sheol&quot;) below. After the 4th century BCE this was gradually replaced by a Greek scientific cosmology of a spherical Earth surrounded by multiple concentric heavens.

=== The cosmic ocean ===

The three-part world of heavens, Earth and underworld floated in &quot;Tehom&quot;, the mythological cosmic ocean, which covered the Earth until God created the firmament to divide it into upper and lower portions and reveal the dry land; the world has been protected from the cosmic ocean ever since by the solid dome of the firmament.

The &quot;tehom&quot; is, or was, hostile to God: it confronted him at the beginning of the world (Psalm 104:6ff) but fled from the dry land at his rebuke; he has now set a boundary or bar for it which it cannot pass (Jeremiah 5:22 and Job 38:8–10). The cosmic sea is the home of monsters which God conquers: &quot;By his power he stilled the sea, by his understanding he smote Rahab!&quot; (Job 26:12f). (Rahab is an exclusively Hebrew sea-monster; others, including Leviathan and the &quot;tannin&quot;, or dragons, are found in Ugaritic texts; it is not entirely clear whether they are identical with Sea or are Sea&#x27;s helpers). The &quot;bronze sea&quot; which stood in the forecourt of the Temple in Jerusalem probably corresponds to the &quot;sea&quot; in Babylonian temples, representing the &quot;apsu&quot;, the cosmic ocean.

In the New Testament Jesus&#x27; conquest of the stormy sea shows the conquering deity overwhelming the forces of chaos: a mere word of command from the Son of God stills the foe (Mark 4:35–41), who then tramples over his enemy, (Jesus walking on water - Mark 6:45, 47–51). In Revelation, where the Archangel Michael expels the dragon (Satan) from heaven (&quot;And war broke out in heaven, with Michael and his angels attacking the dragon...&quot; – Revelation 12:7), the motif can be traced back to Leviathan in Israel and to Tiamat, the chaos-ocean, in Babylonian myth, identified with Satan via an interpretation of the serpent in Eden.

=== Heavens ===
==== Form and structure ====

In the Old Testament the word &quot;shamayim&quot; represented both the sky/atmosphere, and the dwelling place of God. The &quot;&quot; or firmament – the visible sky – was a solid inverted bowl over the Earth, coloured blue from the heavenly ocean above it. Rain, snow, wind and hail were kept in storehouses outside the , which had &quot;windows&quot; to allow them in – the waters for Noah&#x27;s flood entered when the &quot;windows of heaven&quot; were opened. Heaven extended down to and was coterminous with (i.e. it touched) the farthest edges of the Earth (e.g. Deuteronomy 4:32); humans looking up from Earth saw the floor of heaven, which they saw also as God&#x27;s throne, as made of clear blue lapis lazuli (Exodus 24:9–10), and (Ezekiel 1:26). Below that was a layer of water, the source of rain, which was separated from us by an impenetrable barrier, the firmament (Genesis 1:6–8). The rain may also be stored in heavenly cisterns (Job: 38:37) or storehouses (Deut 28:12) alongside the storehouses for wind, hail and snow.

Grammatically the word &quot;shamayim&quot; can be either dual (two) or plural (more than two), without ruling out the singular (one). As a result, it is not clear whether there were one, two, or more heavens in the Old Testament, but most likely there was only one, and phrases such as &quot;heaven of heavens&quot; were meant to stress the vastness of God&#x27;s realm.

The Babylonians had a more complex idea of heaven, and during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) the influence of Babylonian cosmology led to the idea of a plurality of heavens among Jews. This continued into the New Testament: Revelation apparently has only one heaven, but the Epistle to the Hebrews and the epistles to the Colossians and the Ephesians have more than one, although they don&#x27;t specify how many, and the apostle Paul tells of his visit to the third heaven, the place, according to contemporary thought, where the garden of Paradise is to be found. The reference to the &quot;third heaven&quot; may refer to one of two cosmological systems present in antiquity: one where the cosmos was divided into seven heavens, and the other where the cosmos was divided into three.

====God and the heavenly beings====

Israel and Judah, like other Canaanite kingdoms, originally had a full pantheon of gods. The chief of the old Canaanite pantheon was the god El, but over time Yahweh replaced him as the national god and the two merged. The remaining gods were now subject to Yahweh: &quot;Who in the sky is comparable to Yahweh, like Yahweh among the divine beings? A god dreaded in the Council of holy beings...?&quot; (Psalm 89:6–9). In the Book of Job the Council of Heaven, the Sons of God &quot;(bene elohim)&quot; meet in heaven to review events on Earth and decide the fate of Job. One of their number is &quot;the Satan&quot;, literally &quot;the accuser&quot;, who travels over the Earth much like a Persian imperial spy, (Job dates from the period of the Persian empire), reporting on, and testing, the loyalty of men to God.

The heavenly bodies (the heavenly host - Sun, Moon, and stars) were worshiped as deities, a practice which the bible disapproves and of which righteous Job protests his innocence: &quot;If I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon ... and my mouth has kissed my hand, this also would be an iniquity...&quot; Belief in the divinity of the heavenly bodies explains a passage in Joshua 10:12, usually translated as Joshua asking the Sun and Moon to stand still, but in fact Joshua utters an incantation to ensure that the sun-god and moon-god, who supported his enemies, would not provide them with oracles.

In the earlier Old Testament texts the &quot;bene elohim&quot; were gods, but subsequently they became angels, the &quot;messengers&quot; (&quot;malakim&quot;), whom Jacob sees going up and down a &quot;ladder&quot; (actually a celestial mountain) between heaven and Earth. In earlier works the messengers were anonymous, but in the Second Temple period (539 BCE–100 CE) they began to be given names, and eventually became the vast angelic orders of Christianity and Judaism. Thus the gods and goddesses who had once been the superiors or equals of Yahweh were first made his peers, then subordinate gods, and finally ended as angels in his service.

==== Paradise and the human soul ====
There is no concept of a human soul, or of eternal life, in the oldest parts of the Old Testament. Death is the going-out of the breath which God once breathed into the dust, all men face the same fate in Sheol, a shadowy existence without knowledge or feeling (Job 14:13; Qoheloth 9:5), and there is no way that mortals can enter heaven. In the centuries after the Babylonian exile, a belief in afterlife and post-death retribution appeared in Jewish apocalyptic literature. At much the same time the Bible was translated into Greek, and the translators used the Greek word &quot;paradaisos&quot; (Paradise) for the garden of God and Paradise came to be located in heaven.

===Earth===
====Cosmic geography====
In the Old Testament period, the Earth was most commonly thought of as a flat disc floating on water. The concept was apparently quite similar to that depicted in a Babylonian world-map from about 600 BCE: a single circular continent bounded by a circular sea, and beyond the sea a number of equally spaced triangles called &quot;nagu&quot;, &quot;distant regions&quot;, apparently islands although possibly mountains. The Old Testament likewise locates islands alongside the Earth; () these are the &quot;ends of the earth&quot; according to , the extreme edge of Job&#x27;s circular horizon (Job 26:10) where the vault of heaven is supported on mountains. Other OT passages suggest that the sky rests on pillars (Psalm 75:3, 1 Samuel 2:8, Job 9:6), on foundations (Psalms 18:7 and 82:5), or on &quot;supports&quot; (Psalm 104:5). The Book of Job imagines the cosmos as a vast tent, with the Earth as its floor and the sky as the tent itself; from the edges of the sky God hangs the Earth over &quot;nothing&quot;, meaning the vast Ocean, securely supported by being tied to the sky (Job 26:7). If the technical means by which Yahweh keeps the earth from sinking into the chaos-waters are unclear, it is nevertheless clear that he does so by virtue of his personal power.

The author of Revelation assumed a flat Earth in Revelation 7:1. The idea that the Earth was a sphere was developed by the Greeks in the 6th century BCE, and by the 3rd century BCE this was generally accepted by educated Romans and Greeks and even by some Jews.

====Temples, mountains, gardens and rivers====
In the cosmology of the ancient Near East, the cosmic warrior-god, after defeating the powers of chaos, would create the world and build his earthly house, the temple. Just as the abyss, the deepest deep, was the place for Chaos and Death, so God&#x27;s temple belonged on the high mountain. In ancient Judah the mountain and the location of the Temple was Zion (Jerusalem), the navel and center of the world (Ezekiel 5:5 and 38:12). The Psalms describe God sitting enthroned over the Flood (the cosmic sea) in his heavenly palace (Psalm 29:10), the eternal king who &quot;lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters&quot; (Psalm 104:3). The Samaritan Pentateuch identifies this mountain as Mount Gerizim, which the New Testament also implicitly acknowledges (John 4:20). This imagery recalls the Mesopotamian god Ea who places his throne in Apsu, the primeval fresh waters beneath the Earth, and the Canaanite god El, described in the Baal cycle as having his palace on a cosmic mountain which is the source of the primordial ocean/water springs.

The point where heavenly and earthly realms join is depicted as an earthly &quot;garden of God&quot;, associated with the temple and royal palace. Ezekiel 28:12–19 places the garden in Eden on the mountain of the gods; in Genesis 2–3 Eden&#x27;s location is more vague, simply far away &quot;in the east&quot;, but there is a strong suggestion in both that the garden is attached to a temple or palace. In Jerusalem the earthly Temple was decorated with motifs of the cosmos and the Garden, and, like other ancient near eastern temples, its three sections made up a symbolic microcosm, from the outer court (the visible world of land and sea), through the Holy Place (the visible heaven and the garden of God) to the Holy of Holies (the invisible heaven of God). The imagery of the cosmic mountain and garden of Ezekiel reappears in the New Testament Book of Revelation, applied to the messianic Jerusalem, its walls adorned with precious stones, the &quot;river of the water of life&quot; flowing from under its throne (Revelation 22:1–2).

A stream from underground (a subterranean ocean of fresh water?) fertilises Eden before dividing into four rivers that go out to the entire earth (Genesis 2:5–6); in Ezekiel 47:1–12 (see Ezekiel&#x27;s Temple) and other prophets the stream issues from the Temple itself, makes the desert bloom, and turns the Dead Sea from salt to fresh. Yet the underground waters are ambiguous: they are the source of life-giving rivers, but they are also associated with death (Jeremiah 2:6 and Job 38:16-17 describe how the way to Sheol is through water, and its gates are located at the foot of the mountain at the bottom of the seas).

=== Underworld ===

====Sheol and the Old Testament====
Beneath the earth is Sheol, the abode of the &quot;rephaim&quot; (shades), although it is not entirely clear whether all who died became shades, or only the &quot;mighty dead&quot; (compare Psalm 88:10 with Isaiah 14:9 and 26:14). Some biblical passages are interpreted by some as saying that God has no presence in the underworld: &quot;In death there is no remembrance of Thee, in Sheol who shall give Thee thanks?&quot; (Psalm 6). Others imply that the dead themselves are in some sense semi-divine, like the shade of the prophet Samuel, who is called an &quot;elohim&quot;, the same word used for God and gods. Still other passages state God&#x27;s power over Sheol as over the rest of his creation: &quot;Tho they (the wicked) dig into Sheol, from there shall my hand take them...&quot; (Amos 9:2).

====Intertestamental period====
The Old Testament Sheol was simply the home of all the dead, good and bad alike. In the Hellenistic period the Greek-speaking Jews of Egypt, perhaps under the influence of Greek thought, came to believe that the good would go directly to God, while the wicked would really die and go to the realm of Hades, god of the underworld, where they would perhaps suffer torment. The Book of Enoch, dating from the period between the Old and New Testaments, separates the dead into a well-lit cavern for the righteous and dark caverns for the wicked, and provides the former with a spring, perhaps signifying that these are the &quot;living&quot; (i.e. a spring) waters of life. 

====New Testament====
In the New Testament, Jesus&#x27; parable of the rich man and Lazarus reflects the idea that the wicked began their punishment in Hades immediately on dying.

====Satan and the end of time====

Hades in the New Testament is a temporary holding place, to be used only until the end of time, when its inhabitants will be thrown into the pit of Gehenna or the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:10–14). This lake is either underground, or will go underground when the &quot;new earth&quot; emerges. The Satan does not inhabit or supervise the underworld – his sphere of activity is the human world – and is only to be thrown into the fire at the end of time. He appears throughout the Old Testament not as God&#x27;s enemy but as his minister, &quot;a sort of Attorney-General with investigative and disciplinary powers&quot;, as in the Book of Job. It was only with the early Church Fathers that he was identified with the serpent in the Garden of Eden and came to be seen as an active rebel against God, seeking to thwart the divine plan for humankind.

<text>Carey Estes Kefauver ( ;
July 26, 1903 – August 10, 1963) was an American politician from Tennessee. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1939 to 1949 and in the U.S. Senate from 1949 until his death in 1963.

After leading a much-publicized investigation into organized crime in the early 1950s, he twice sought his party&#x27;s nomination for President of the United States. In 1956, he was selected by the Democratic National Convention to be the running mate of presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson. He continued to hold his U.S. Senate seat after the Stevenson–Kefauver ticket lost to the Eisenhower–Nixon ticket. Kefauver was named chair of the U.S. Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1957 and served as its chairman until his death.

==Early life==
Carey Estes Kefauver was born in Madisonville, Tennessee, the son of local hardware merchant Robert Cooke Kefauver and his wife Phredonia Bradford Estes. Kefauver was introduced to politics at an early age when his father served as mayor of their hometown. The elder Kefauver would later be an active and enthusiastic helper in his son&#x27;s campaigns until his death in 1958 at the age of 87.

Kefauver attended the University of Tennessee and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1924. He was a tackle and guard on his college football team. He taught mathematics and coached football at a Hot Springs, Arkansas, high school for a year before going on to Yale Law School, from which he earned an LL.B. &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1927.

Kefauver practiced law in Chattanooga for the next twelve years, beginning with the firm of Cooke, Swaney &amp; Cooke, and eventually becoming a partner in Sizer, Chambliss &amp; Kefauver.

In 1935, he married Nancy Pigott (born January 21, 1911, in Helensburgh, Dumbartonshire, UK), the daughter of British-American engineer Sir Stephen Pigott, whom he had met during her visit to relatives in Chattanooga. A graduate of the Glasgow School of Art with a budding career as an artist, she changed focus after her marriage and worked diligently and effectively for her husband&#x27;s campaigns. The couple raised four children, one of them adopted. Mrs. Kefauver died November 20, 1967.

Moved by his role as attorney for the &quot;Chattanooga News&quot;, Kefauver became interested in local politics and sought election to the Tennessee Senate in 1938. He lost but in 1939 spent two months as Finance and Taxation Commissioner under the newly elected governor Prentice Cooper. When Congressman Sam D. McReynolds of Tennessee&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, which included Chattanooga, died in 1939, Kefauver was elected to succeed him in the House.

==Political career==

===U.S. House of Representatives===

Kefauver was elected to five terms in the House of Representatives as a Democrat. As a member of the House during President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s time in office, Kefauver distinguished himself from the other Democrats in Tennessee&#x27;s congressional delegation, most of whom were conservatives, by becoming a staunch supporter of the President&#x27;s New Deal legislation. In particular, he backed the controversial Tennessee Valley Authority and was best known for his successful bid to rebuff the efforts of Tennessee Senator Kenneth McKellar to gain political control over the agency.

As a member of the House, &quot;Kefauver began to manifest his concern over the growing concentration of economic power in the United States&quot;, concentrating much of his legislative efforts on congressional reform and anti-monopoly measures. Among the committees Kefauver chaired was the House Select Committee on Small Business, which investigated economic concentration in the U.S. business world in 1946. That same year, Kefauver also introduced legislation to plug loopholes in the Clayton Antitrust Act.

In a May 1948 article, which appeared in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, Kefauver also proposed that more staff and money be allocated to the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, and to the Federal Trade Commission; that new legislation to make it easier to prosecute big corporations be enacted; and recommended the danger of monopolies should be publicized more.

The Kefauver investigation into television and juvenile delinquency in the mid-1950s led to an even more intensive investigation in the early 1960s. The new probe came about after people became increasingly concerned over juvenile violence, and the possibility of this behavior being related to violent television programs.

His progressive stances on the issues put Kefauver in direct competition with E. H. Crump, the former U.S. Congressman, mayor of Memphis, and boss of the state&#x27;s Democratic Party, when he chose to seek the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1948. During the primary, Crump and his allies accused Kefauver of being a &quot;fellow traveler&quot; and of working for the &quot;pinkos and communists&quot; with the stealth of a raccoon. 
In a televised speech given in Memphis, in which he responded to such charges, Kefauver put on a coonskin cap and proudly proclaimed, &quot;I may be a pet coon, but I&#x27;m not Boss Crump&#x27;s pet coon.&quot;

To win election to the Senate, Kefauver defeated the incumbent Tom Stewart in the 1948 Democratic primary. Kefauver was backed by the influential editor Edward J. Meeman of the &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot;, who had long fought the Crump machine for its corruption and stranglehold over Memphis politics. After he went on to win both the primary and the election, he adopted the cap as his trademark and wore it in every successive campaign. He received the cap from journalist Drue Smith.

Kefauver was unique in Tennessee politics in his outspoken liberal views, a stand which established a permanent bloc of opposition to him in the state. Kefauver&#x27;s success—despite his liberal views—was predicated largely on his support by the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;, a consistently liberal newspaper that served as a focus for anti-Crump sentiment in the state. His constituency included many prominent citizens, whose views were considerably less liberal than his, but who admired him for his integrity.

Despite opposition from the Crump machine, Kefauver won the Democratic nomination, which in those days was tantamount to election in Tennessee. His victory is widely seen as the beginning of the end for the Crump machine&#x27;s influence in statewide politics.

Once in the Senate, Kefauver began to make a name for himself as a crusader for consumer protection laws and antitrust legislation. On civil rights, he was ambivalent: he admitted later that he had difficulty adjusting to the idea of racial integration, and in 1960 he held out to the last in favor of permitting cross-examination of black complainants in voting rights cases. Despite this fact, Kefauver supported the civil rights program generally, and consistently supported organized labor and other movements considered liberal in the South at that time.

===U.S. Senate===

====Overview====
After being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948, Kefauver guided the Celler–Kefauver Act of 1950, which amended the Clayton Act by plugging loopholes that allowed a corporation to purchase a competing firm&#x27;s assets, through the U.S. Senate. Between 1957 and 1963, his U.S. Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee investigated concentration in the U.S. economy, industry by industry, and it issued a report exposing monopoly prices in the steel, automotive, bread and pharmaceutical industries. In May 1963, Kefauver&#x27;s subcommittee concluded that within monopolized U.S. industries no real price competition existed anymore and also recommended that General Motors be broken up into competing firms.

Kefauver&#x27;s Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee also held hearings on the pharmaceutical industry between 1959 and 1963 that led to enactment of his most famous legislative achievement, the Kefauver-Harris Drug Act of 1962, after Kefauver expressed shock about the excess profits that U.S. drug companies were taking in at the expense of U.S. consumers. Some of what Kefauver&#x27;s hearings on the U.S. pharmaceutical industry revealed includes the following:

&quot;Witnesses told of conflicts of interest for the American Medical Association (whose journal, for example, received millions of dollars in drug advertising and was, therefore, reluctant to challenge claims made by drug company ads)…The drug companies themselves were shown to be engaged in frenzied advertising campaigns designed to sell trade-name versions of drugs that could otherwise be prescribed under generic names at a fraction of the cost; this competition, in turn, had led to the marketing of new drugs that were no improvements on drugs already on the market, but nevertheless heralded as dramatic breakthroughs without proper concern for either effectiveness or safety.&quot;

At that time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had limited authority to require efficacy standards or disclose risks. Kefauver was accused of expanding the power of government excessively, interfering with the freedom of doctors and patients, and threatening the viability of the pharmaceutical industry. His legislation seemed likely to fail. However, at the end of 1961, European and Australian doctors reported that an epidemic of children born with deformities of their arms and legs was caused by their use of thalidomide, which was heavily marketed to pregnant women.

These positions made him even more unpopular with his state party&#x27;s machine than ever before, especially after fellow Tennessee senator Albert Gore Sr., Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, and he became one of the only three Southern senators to not sign the so-called Southern Manifesto in 1956. He was named in a popular account of the Senate as a Southern Senator who had been excluded from the Southern Caucus due to his opposition to the filibuster and less than impeccable defense of States rights.

In fact, these unpopular positions, combined with his reputation as a maverick with a penchant for sanctimony, earned him so much enmity even from other senators that one Democratic insider felt compelled to dub him &quot;the most hated man in Congress&quot;.

Kefauver also led hearings that targeted indecent publications and pornography. Among his targets were pin-ups, including Bettie Page, and the magazines that featured them.

====Kefauver committee====
In 1950, Kefauver headed a U.S. Senate committee investigating organized crime. The committee, officially known as the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce, was popularly known as the Kefauver committee or the Kefauver hearings. The committee held hearings in fourteen cities and heard testimony from over 600 witnesses. Many of the witnesses were high-profile crime bosses, including such well-known names as Willie Moretti, Joe Adonis, and Frank Costello, the last making himself famous by refusing to allow his face to be filmed during his questioning and then staging a much-publicized walkout. A number of politicians also appeared before the committee and saw their careers ruined. Among them were former Governor Harold G. Hoffman of New Jersey and Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer of New York City.

The committee&#x27;s hearings, which were televised live, just as many Americans were first buying televisions, made Kefauver nationally famous and introduced many Americans to the concept of a criminal organization known as the Mafia for the first time. In fact, in 1951, Kefauver appeared as a celebrity guest on the new game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; discussing the hearings briefly with the panel, showing how popular these hearings were with early television viewers.

Although the hearings boosted Kefauver&#x27;s political prospects, they helped to end the twelve-year Senate career of Democratic Majority Leader Scott Lucas. In a tight 1950 reelection race against former Illinois Representative Everett Dirksen, Lucas urged Kefauver to keep his investigation away from an emerging Chicago police scandal until after election day, but Kefauver refused. Election-eve publication of stolen secret committee documents hurt the Democratic Party in Cook County, cost Lucas the election, and gave Dirksen national prominence as the man who defeated the Senate majority leader.

====1952 election====

In the 1952 presidential election, Kefauver ran for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination. Campaigning in his coonskin cap, often by dogsled, Kefauver won in an electrifying victory in the New Hampshire primary, defeating Harry S. Truman, the sitting president of the United States. Truman then withdrew his bid for re-election.

Kefauver won 12 of the 15 primaries in 1952, losing two to &quot;favorite son&quot; candidates and Florida to leading Southern Democrat Richard Russell. He received 3.1 million votes, while the eventual 1952 Democratic presidential nominee, Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, got only 78,000 votes. But primaries were not, at that time, the main method of delegate selection for the national convention. Kefauver entered the convention with a few hundred votes still needed for a majority of the delegates.

The Kefauver campaign became the classic example of how presidential primary victories in the Democratic Party do not automatically lead to the nomination itself. Although he began the balloting far ahead of the other declared candidates, Kefauver eventually lost the nomination to Stevenson, the choice of the Democratic Party political bosses. Stevenson, a one-term governor who was up for reelection in 1952, had resisted calls to enter the race, but he was nominated anyway by a &quot;draft Stevenson&quot; movement that had been energized by his eloquent keynote speech on the opening night of the convention. John Sparkman was selected as the Democratic candidate for vice president. Stevenson lost the general election in November to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican nominee, in a landslide.

====1956 election====

 In 1956, Kefauver again sought the Democratic presidential nomination. In the March 13 New Hampshire primary, he defeated Adlai Stevenson 21,701 to 3,806. A week later, Kefauver again defeated Stevenson in the Minnesota primary, winning 245,885 votes compared to Stevenson&#x27;s 186,723 votes. Kefauver was also victorious in the Wisconsin primary.

By April 1956, it appeared that Kefauver would match his spectacular performance in the primaries of four years earlier. But this time, Kefauver had active competition not only from Stevenson, but also from Governor W. Averell Harriman of New York, who was endorsed by former President Truman.

Stevenson got significantly more endorsements and raised far more funds than Kefauver. He defeated Kefauver in the Oregon, Florida, and California primaries and, overall, won more primary votes than Kefauver. After his devastating loss in the California primary, Kefauver suspended his campaign. At the Democratic National Convention, Stevenson was again nominated for president.

Stevenson then decided to let the delegates themselves pick his vice-presidential nominee, instead of making that choice himself. Although Stevenson preferred Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts as his running mate, he did not attempt to influence the balloting in any way, and Kefauver eventually received the nomination for vice president.

Stevenson lost the November election to Eisenhower by an even bigger margin than in 1952.

====Later career====
After his 1956 defeat, Kefauver was considered the front-runner for the 1960 Democratic nomination. In an attempt to gain more public exposure, Kefauver proposed a federal ban on the sale or possession of switchblades in 1957. He timed hearings on the legislation to coincide with a series of lurid articles in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and other periodicals of the day on the use of switchblades by juvenile delinquents and gangs. At each hearing the senator would display a bizarre array of confiscated bayonets, trench knives, daggers, and switchblades, all of which he described to the press as &quot;switchblade knives&quot;. However, Kefauver&#x27;s switchblade bill failed, in large part due to residual bad feelings between Kefauver and other senators. In 1959, the senator let it be known that he was not going to campaign a third time for the presidential nomination. He continued to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate; the abandonment of presidential ambitions led to his most productive years as a senator. While he largely faded from the public eye, he earned the respect of congressional colleagues from both parties for his independence and his sponsorship of a number of important foreign and domestic legislative measures.

When he ran for reelection to a third term in 1960, his first and, it would turn out, last attempt at running for office after refusing to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto and voting in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, he faced staunch opposition for renomination from his party&#x27;s still-thriving pro-segregation wing. Nonetheless, he won the Democratic primary decisively, receiving nearly double the votes of his rival, judge Andrew T. Taylor of Jackson. Kefauver went on to defeat his Republican opponent in the general election, attorney Bradley Frazier of Camden, by more than a 2-to-1 margin.
Kefauver voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1962, Kefauver, who had become known to the public at large as the chief enemy of crooked businessmen in the Senate, introduced legislation that would eventually pass into law as the Kefauver-Harris Drug Control Act. This bill, which Kefauver dubbed his &quot;finest achievement&quot; in consumer protection, imposed controls on the pharmaceutical industry that required that drug companies disclose to doctors the side-effects of their products, allow their products to be sold as generic drugs after having held the patent on them for a certain period of time, and be able to prove on demand that their products were, in fact, effective and safe.

In signing the Kefauver-Harris Drug Control Act, President John F. Kennedy stated, &quot;As I say, we want to pay particular appreciation to Senator Kefauver for the long hearings which he held which permitted us to have very effective legislation on hand when this matter became of such strong public interest.&quot;

== Death ==
On August 8, 1963, Kefauver suffered what was reported as a &quot;mild&quot; heart attack on the floor of the Senate while attempting to place an antitrust amendment into a NASA appropriations bill which would have required companies benefiting financially from the outcome of research subsidized by NASA, to reimburse NASA for the cost of the research. Two days after the attack, Kefauver died in his sleep in Bethesda Naval Hospital of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. After a wake in Washington, D.C., his body was taken to the First Baptist Church in Madisonville where thousands of mourners paid their respects. He was interred in a family cemetery beside his home.

There was some speculation that Nancy Kefauver might stand for election to her late husband&#x27;s Senate seat in 1964, but she quashed such notions early on. Tennessee Governor Frank Clement appointed Herbert S. Walters to the seat instead. In November 1963, President Kennedy named Nancy Kefauver to be the first head of the new Art in Embassies Program—Kennedy&#x27;s last presidential appointment. Mrs. Kefauver never considered remarrying, remarking that she &quot;had too perfect a marriage&quot;.

The federal courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, was renamed the Estes Kefauver Federal Building and United States Courthouse in his honor. One of the libraries at the University of Tennessee was also named for him; his papers are held there. The bridge over Pickwick Dam in Counce, Tennessee is named Estes Kefauver Bridge. One of the two city parks in Madisonville, Tennessee, is named Kefauver Park in his honor, as well.

<text>The Missouri Botanical Garden is a botanical garden located at 4344 Shaw Boulevard in St. Louis, Missouri. It is also known informally as Shaw&#x27;s Garden for founder and philanthropist Henry Shaw. Its herbarium, with more than 6.6 million specimens, is the second largest in North America, behind that of the New York Botanical Garden. The &quot;Index Herbariorum&quot; code assigned to the herbarium is MO and it is used when citing housed specimens.

==History==
The land that is currently the Missouri Botanical Garden was previously the land of businessman Henry Shaw.

Founded in 1859, the Missouri Botanical Garden is one of the oldest botanical institutions in the United States and a National Historic Landmark. It is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1983, the botanical garden was added as the fourth subdistrict of the Metropolitan Zoological Park and Museum District.
The garden is a center for botanical research and science education of international repute, as well as an oasis in the city of St. Louis, with of horticultural display. It includes a Japanese strolling garden named Seiwa-en; the Climatron geodesic dome conservatory; a children&#x27;s garden, including a pioneer village; a playground; a fountain area and a water locking system, somewhat similar to the locking system at the Panama Canal; an Osage camp; and Henry Shaw&#x27;s original 1850 estate home. It is adjacent to Tower Grove Park, another of Shaw&#x27;s legacies.

For part of 2006, the Missouri Botanical Garden featured &quot;Glass in the Garden&quot;, with glass sculptures by Dale Chihuly placed throughout the garden. Four pieces were purchased to remain at the gardens. In 2008 sculptures of the French artist Niki de Saint Phalle were placed throughout the garden. In 2009, the 150th anniversary of the garden was celebrated, including a floral clock display.

After 40 years of service to the garden, Dr. Peter Raven retired from his presidential post on September 1, 2010. Dr. Peter Wyse Jackson replaced him as President.

In 2024, the Tower Grove House was added to the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. Records show that in 1855, four people enslaved by Shaw escaped the house and crossed the Mississippi River with help from Mary Meachum. A woman, Esther, and her three children were captured immediately after crossing. Shaw placed a bounty on Jim Kennerly, who had escaped.

==Cultural festivals==
The garden is a place for many annual cultural festivals, such as the Japanese Festival and the Chinese Culture Days by the St. Louis Chinese Culture Days Committee. During this time, there are showcases of the culture&#x27;s botanics as well as cultural arts, crafts, music and food. The Japanese Festival features sumo wrestling, taiko drumming, koma-mawashi top spinning, and kimono fashion shows. The garden is known for its bonsai growing, which can be seen all year round but is highlighted during the multiple Asian festivals.

===Popular culture===
Douglas Trumbull, the director of the 1972 science fiction classic film &quot;Silent Running&quot;, stated that the geodesic domes on the spaceship &quot;Valley Forge&quot; were based on the Missouri Botanical Garden&#x27;s Climatron dome.

==Butterfly House==
Missouri Botanical Garden also operates the Sophia M. Sachs Butterfly House in Chesterfield. The Butterfly House includes an indoor butterfly conservatory as well as an outdoor butterfly garden.

==EarthWays Center==
The EarthWays Center is a group at the Missouri Botanical Garden that provides resources on and educates the public about green practices, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other sustainability matters.

==Shaw Nature Reserve==

The Shaw Nature Reserve was started by the Missouri Botanical Garden in 1925 as a place to store plants away from the pollution of the city. The air in St. Louis later cleared up, and the reserve has continued to be open to the public for enjoyment, research, and education ever since. The reserve is located in Gray Summit, Missouri, away from the city.

==The Plant List==
The Plant List is an Internet encyclopedia project to compile a comprehensive list of botanical nomenclature, created by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the Missouri Botanical Garden. The Plant List has 1,040,426 scientific plant names of species rank, of which 298,900 are accepted species names. In addition, the list has 620 plant families and 16,167 plant genera.

== Living Earth Collaborative ==
In September 2017 the Missouri Botanical Garden teamed up with the St. Louis Zoo and Washington University in St. Louis in a conservation effort known as the Living Earth Collaborative. The collaborative, run by Washington University scientist Jonathan Losos, seeks to promote further understanding of the ways humans can help to preserve the varied natural environments that allow plants, animals and microbes to survive and thrive.

==Sponsorship==
Monsanto had donated $10 million to the Missouri Botanical Garden since the 1970s, which named its 1998 plant science facility the Monsanto Center. The center has since been renamed to the Bayer Center following Monsanto&#x27;s acquisition by Bayer.

<text>Moritz Benedikt Cantor (23 August 1829 – 10 April 1920) was a German historian of mathematics.

==Biography==
Cantor was born at Mannheim. He came from a Sephardi Jewish family that had emigrated to the Netherlands from Portugal, another branch of which had established itself in Russia. In his early youth, Moritz Cantor was not strong enough to go to school, and his parents decided to educate him at home. Later, however, he was admitted to an advanced class of the Gymnasium in Mannheim. From there he went to the University of Heidelberg in 1848, and soon after to the University of Göttingen, where he studied under Gauss and Weber, and where Stern awakened in him a strong interest in historical research.

After obtaining his PhD at the University of Heidelberg in 1851, he went to Berlin, where he eagerly followed the lectures of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet; and upon his return to Heidelberg in 1853, he was appointed privat-docent at the university. In 1863, he was promoted to the position of assistant professor, and in 1877 he became honorary professor.

Cantor was one of the founders of the &quot;Kritische Zeitschrift für Chemie, Physik und Mathematik&quot;. In 1859 he became associated with Schlömilch as editor of the &quot;Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik&quot;, taking charge of the historical and literary section. Since 1877, through his efforts, a supplement to the &quot;Zeitschrift&quot; was published under the separate title of &quot;Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik&quot;.

Cantor&#x27;s inaugural dissertation, &quot;Über ein weniger gebräuchliches Coordinaten-System&quot; (1851), gave no indication that the history of exact sciences would soon be enriched by a master work by him. His first important work was &quot;Über die Einführung unserer gegenwärtigen Ziffern in Europa&quot;, which he wrote for the &quot;Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik&quot;, 1856, vol. i.

His greatest work was &quot;Vorlesungen über Geschichte der Mathematik&quot;. This comprehensive history of mathematics appeared as follows:
* Volume 1 (1880) - &quot;From the earliest times until 1200&quot;
* Volume 2 (1892) - &quot;From 1200 to 1668&quot;
* Volume 3 (1894-1896) - &quot;From 1668 to 1758&quot;
* Volume 4 (1908) (with nine collaborators, Cantor as editor) - &quot;From 1759 to 1799&quot;

Many historians credit him for founding a new discipline in a field that had hitherto lacked the sound, conscientious, and critical methods of other fields of history.

In 1900 Moritz Cantor received the honor of giving a plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris (&quot;Sur l&#x27;historiographie des mathématiques&quot;).

<doc id="307976" wikidata="Q791439" url="?curid=307976" title="Battlefield 1942">
<text>Battlefield 1942 is a 2002 first-person shooter video game developed by Digital Illusions CE and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. The game can be played in single-player mode against the video game AI or in multiplayer mode against players on the Internet or in a local area network. It is a popular platform for mod developers, with many released modifications that alter the gameplay and theme.

In-game, players assume the role of one of five classes of infantry: Scout, Assault, Anti-Tank, Medic, and Engineer. Players also have the ability to fly various World War II fighter aircraft and bombers, navigate capital ships, submarines, and aircraft carriers, man coastal artillery defenses, drive tanks, APCs and jeeps, and take control of anti-aircraft guns and mounted machine guns.

Each battle takes place on one of several maps located in a variety of places and famous battlefields in all of the major theaters of World War II: the Pacific, European, North African, Eastern, and Italian Fronts. Combat is between the Axis powers and the Allies. The location determines which nation-specific armies are used (for example, on the Wake Island map, it is Japan versus the United States, while on the El Alamein map, it is Germany versus the United Kingdom). The maps in &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; are based on real battles and are somewhat realistically portrayed.

Upon release, &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; received generally favorable reviews, with particular praise directed towards the innovative gameplay, multiplayer, and World War II theme. The game went on to perform well commercially, with over 3 million copies sold by 2004. Since its release, the game has spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs, which became part of what ultimately would become the &quot;Battlefield&quot; game series. &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; is retrospectively considered to be one of the best video games of all time.

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay of &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; generally has a more co-operative focus than previous games of this nature, as it is not only important to kill the opposition but to also hold certain &quot;control points&quot; around the map. Capturing control points allows the team to reinforce itself by enabling players and vehicles to spawn in a given area. Additionally, capturing and controlling control points also reduces enemy reinforcements. &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; was one of the first mainstream FPS games to actively encourage teamwork and coordination over individual &quot;lone wolf&quot; style gameplay.

The default gameplay mode, Conquest, centers on capturing &quot;control points&quot; which serve as locations for respawning, often referred to as &quot;spawn points&quot;. Rounds have a time limit and each team starts the round with a set number of tickets which are consumed when members of that team respawn. If a team does not control any spawn points, members cannot spawn unless the remaining living members capture one. If a team reaches zero tickets, members of that team cannot respawn for the rest of the match.

A team loses tickets when its members are killed, but also at a fixed rate when the other team holds a greater number of capture points; the greater the disparity in held capture points, the greater the rate of ticket loss to the disadvantaged side, which encourages teams to focus on taking and defending control points. A match is won by killing all members of the opposing team when they either have no remaining tickets, or no available spawn points. Sometimes players on a losing team may hide instead of fight when their team&#x27;s tickets and respawn points are reduced to zero, forcing the winning team to methodically search for them in order to end the round before the round timer expires.

=== Roles ===
The player can choose to play as either the Allied team or the Axis team. The Allies consist of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the Soviet Union, while the Axis consists of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Regardless of which nation is chosen by the player, there are five different infantry roles the player can select from: Scout, Assault, Medic, Anti-tank, and Engineer.

Each role has its own strength and weakness. For example, the scout role has long-range surveillance, high stopping power and the ability to provide spotting for artillery shelling by another player. Assault is the primary anti-infantry role, focused on directly engaging other players at short and medium range. The Anti-tank role specializes in attacking tanks and other vehicles, but their main weapon is inaccurate against moving enemy infantry. The Medic role has the ability to heal players including themselves, but their sub-machine gun has less stopping power than the Assault class&#x27;s rifle. The Engineer has the ability to repair damaged vehicles and stationary weapons, and they also have the ability to deploy explosives, which are highly effective against both enemy infantry and vehicles, and land mines, which destroy enemy vehicles on contact.

== Development ==
In 2000, DICE acquired Refraction Games (developers of &quot;Codename Eagle&quot;) and inherited the in-development &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;. The game was originally proposed by DICE as a GameCube exclusive. Though satisfied with the proposal, negotiations never made it further because Nintendo had no online strategy. The game was developed by a team of 14 people at Digital Illusions. &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; was built on the formula of the less well-known and successful &quot;Codename Eagle&quot; video game, set in an alternate history World War I. It featured single and multiplayer modes. The earlier Refractor 1 engine had more arcade-style physics and a less realistic focus than its successor, Refractor 2, which was used in &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;. A Macintosh-compatible version of &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; was made and released by Aspyr Media in mid-2004. An Xbox version of the game was also announced in early 2001 but was cancelled almost two years later so Electronic Arts could more closely work on an expansion pack for the PC.

== Expansions ==
Two expansion packs would be released for &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;, &quot;Battlefield 1942: The Road to Rome&quot; (adding the Italian Front) and &quot;Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII&quot;, both adding various new gameplay modes, maps, and game concepts. &quot;The Road to Rome&quot; focuses on the Italian battles, allowing players to play as the Free French forces or as the Royal Italian Army. &quot;Secret Weapons of WWII&quot; focuses on prototypical, experimental, and rarely used weapons and vehicles (such as jet packs), and added subfactions to the German and British Armies, the German Elite Troops and British Commandos. Accompany each were patches to the base game that fixed bugs, and added extra content (such as the Battle of Britain map) to the base game. &quot;Battlefield 1942 Deluxe Edition&quot; includes the original game and &quot;Battlefield 1942: The Road To Rome&quot;, and the &quot;Battlefield 1942: World War II Anthology&quot; added &quot;Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII&quot; expansion pack. &quot;Battlefield 1942: The Complete Collection&quot; later added &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Battlefield Vietnam WWII Mod&quot;.

== Reception ==
In the United States, &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; sold 680,000 copies and earned $27.1 million by August 2006. At the time, this led &quot;Edge&quot; to rank it as the country&#x27;s 18th best-selling computer game released since January 2000. Combined sales of all &quot;Battlefield&quot; computer games, including &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;, had reached 2.7 million units in the United States by August 2006. In December 2002, the game received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The game sold more than 3 million copies by July 2004.

The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, just one point shy of &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. At 6th annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; received awards for Online Gameplay, Innovation in PC Gaming, PC Game of the Year, and Game of the Year. In March 2010 &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; was awarded with &quot;Swedish game of the decade&quot; award at the computer game gala hosted by Swedish Games Industry.

Scott Osborne of GameSpot called it a &quot;comic book version of WWII.&quot; The publication later named it the best computer game of September 2002. Steve Butts of IGN praised the multiplayer, but said that &quot;the single-player game leaves much to be desired.&quot;

&quot;PC Gamer US&quot; and &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; the best multiplayer computer game and best overall computer game of 2002; it tied with &quot;No One Lives Forever 2&quot; for the latter award in &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;. It also won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Multiplayer Action Game on PC&quot; and &quot;Biggest Surprise on PC&quot; awards, and was nominated in the publication&#x27;s &quot;Best Graphics (Technical) on PC&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year on PC&quot; categories. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s editors hailed it as &quot;the realization of our &#x27;dream PC game&#x27; — multiplayer battles in which every interesting element of combat is playable by human teammates and opponents.&quot;

The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; with four honors at the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards): &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot;, and &quot;Online Gameplay of the Year&quot;; it also received a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot;.

== Franchise ==

&quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; was the first in the &quot;Battlefield&quot; series and would go on to spawn many sequels and spin-offs set in different eras of war. Releases included &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; in 2004, &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; in 2005, &quot;Battlefield 2142&quot; in 2006, &quot;Battlefield 1943&quot; in 2009, &quot;&quot; in 2008 and , &quot;Battlefield 3&quot; in 2011, &quot;Battlefield 4&quot; in 2013, &quot;Battlefield Hardline&quot;, a cops-and-robbers spinoff, in 2015, &quot;Battlefield 1&quot;, a World War I based title, in 2016, &quot;Battlefield V&quot;, the first time since &quot;Battlefield 1943&quot; that the series saw a return to a World War II theater of operations, and the first since &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; set outside the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II in 2018, and &quot;Battlefield 2042&quot; in 2021. All of these releases have been overseen by DICE, with &quot;Hardline&quot; being developed by Visceral Games, with additional developers like Criterion Games, EA Gothenburg and Ripple Effect Studios providing additional development.

== Mods ==
An October 2004 public release from EA noted the game&#x27;s modding community.

Like &quot;Half-Life&quot; and some other popular FPS games, &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; spawned a number of mods. Most did not progress very far and were abandoned without ever producing a public release. Some are very limited and just include some gameplay changes or even a different loading screen while others are total conversions that modify content and gameplay extensively. A few mods have become popular and are nearly games in their own right. Early modifications of Battlefield 1942 were produced without a software development kit. Later a &quot;Mod Development Kit&quot;, Battlefield Mod Development Toolkit, was produced by EA to help the development of mods. With the release of the Battlefield 1942 sequel &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;, some mods have released a new version or have continued development with that game. &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; uses an updated version of the &quot;Refractor 2&quot; game engine. Some mods have switched to the computer games &quot;Söldner: Secret Wars&quot;, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; while others were releasing a standalone game after completed mod development for Battlefield 1942 (Eve of Destruction - REDUX and FinnWars).

*&quot;Battlefield 1918&quot;, A mod set during World War I which was first released in 2004 and as of December 2022 is still in active development. Battlefield 1918 was mentioned as an inspiration for Battlefield 1 by key DICE employee Lars Gustavsson in a 2016 interview.
* &quot;Battlefield Interstate 1982&quot;, mentioned in &quot;1UP&quot; &quot;Free PC Games&quot; December 2003 article. (&quot;Free PC Games&quot; &quot;1UP.ORG&quot; December 2003.)
* &quot;Battle G.I. Joe&quot; was reviewed on About.com, by Michael Klappenbach. The mod was also contacted by Hasbro for IP issues, as noted in &quot;Am I Mod or Not?&quot; (Nieborg, 2005)
* &quot;Desert Combat&quot;, produced by Trauma Studios, was winner of FilePlanet&#x27;s &quot;Best Mod of 2003 Award&quot; and many other reviews and awards, such as the March 2003 &quot;PC Magazine&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; described it as &quot;Desert Combat is set in the white-hot conflict zone of the Middle East and pits the United States against Iraq.&quot; Articles noted it was helped by the Iraq War, which increased the number of page views to approximately 15,000 per day, or even between 20,000 and 70,000. Desert Combat was pointed out as having two mods of its own, &quot;DC Extended&quot; and &quot;Desert Combat Realism&quot; in &quot;Am I Mod or Not?&quot; (Nieborg, 2005)
* &quot;Eve Of Destruction&quot; was the winner of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; 2003 Mod of the Year. Dan Morris of PC Gamer noted in the March 2004 issue of PC Gamer, &quot;While Battlefield Vietnam was still a twinkle in its developers&#x27; eyes, this standout mod debuted to a rapturous reception from the Battlefield 1942 faithful.&quot;
* &quot;Experience WWII&quot; was described in PC Gamer as having substantial changes to be historically accurate that directly impacts gameplay.
* &quot;FinnWars&quot; was featured in &quot;Pelit&quot; magazine in issue 9/2005, and &quot;PC Pelaaja&quot; in 2007. FinnWars is based in Winter and Continuation Wars between Finland and the Soviet Union, as well as Lapland War between Finland and Nazi Germany.
* &quot;Forgotten Hope&quot;, a 2003 mod that aimed at a high degree of historical accuracy, was noted for including over 250 new pieces of authentic equipment (at the time more than any other World War II-themed FPS). It was awarded the Macologist Mod of the Year Award by Inside Mac Games in 2006 after the mod was ported to the Mac. It was followed by its 2006 &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; sequel, &quot;Forgotten Hope 2&quot;.
* &quot;Galactic Conquest&quot; was noted for its permission to blatantly use Lucasarts Star Wars universe material in &quot;Am I Mod or Not?&quot; (Nieborg, 2005). It was mentioned in &quot;Edge&quot; in April 2004. &quot;Galactic Conquest&quot; was reviewed on TechTV&#x27;s &quot;X-Play&quot; show in 2004.
* &quot;HydroRacers&quot; was reviewed in &quot;PC Zone&quot; in 2004 by Tony Lamb, and also the &quot;Madison Courier&quot; in June 2004.
* &quot;Siege&quot; was pointed out in a study by Utrecht University, both for its original concept, and its medieval warfare theme. &quot;Am I Mod or Not?&quot; (Nieborg, 2005)
* &quot;SilentHeroes&quot; won the &quot;PC ACTION-Super Mod Award&quot; in edition 07/2006 of the German gaming-magazine PC ACTION. Also, it was featured on many Norwegian and Swedish media websites, including VG, Aftonbladet and IDG.

<doc id="307981" wikidata="Q1253791" url="?curid=307981" title="Peculiar velocity">
<text>Peculiar motion or peculiar velocity refers to the velocity of an object relative to a &quot;rest frame&quot;—usually a frame in which the average velocity of some objects is zero.

== Galactic astronomy ==

In galactic astronomy, peculiar motion refers to the motion of an object (usually a star) relative to a Galactic rest frame.

Local objects are commonly examined as to their vectors of position angle and radial velocity. These can be combined through vector addition to state the object&#x27;s motion relative to the Sun. Velocities for local objects are sometimes reported with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR)—the average local motion of material in the galaxy—instead of the Sun&#x27;s rest frame. Translating between the LSR and heliocentric rest frames requires the calculation of the Sun&#x27;s peculiar velocity in the LSR.

== Cosmology ==

In physical cosmology, peculiar velocity refers to the components of a galaxy&#x27;s velocity that deviate from the Hubble flow. According to Hubble&#x27;s law, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance from us.

Galaxies are not distributed evenly throughout observable space, but are typically found in groups or clusters, where they have a significant gravitational effect one on another. Velocity dispersions of galaxies arising from this gravitational attraction are usually in the hundreds of kilometers per second, but they can rise to over 1000 km/s in rich clusters. This velocity can alter the recessional velocity that would be expected from the Hubble flow and affect the observed redshift of objects via the relativistic Doppler effect. The Doppler redshift due to peculiar velocities is
:formula_1

which is approximately
:formula_2

for low velocities (small redshifts). This combines with the redshift from the Hubble flow and the redshift from our own motion formula_3 to give the observed redshift
:formula_4

(There may also be a gravitational redshift to consider.)

The radial velocity of a cosmologically &quot;close&quot; object can be approximated by
:formula_5

with contributions from both the Hubble flow and peculiar velocity terms, where formula_6 is the Hubble constant and formula_7 is the distance to the object.

Redshift-space distortions can cause the spatial distributions of cosmological objects to appear elongated or flattened out, depending on the cause of the peculiar velocities. Elongation, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Fingers of God&quot; effect, is caused by random thermal motion of objects; however, correlated peculiar velocities from gravitational infall are the cause of a flattening effect. The main consequence is that, in determining the distance of a single galaxy, a possible error must be assumed. This error becomes smaller as distance increases. For example, in surveys of type Ia supernovae, peculiar velocities have a significant influence on measurements out to redshifts around 0.5, leading to errors of several percent when calculating cosmological parameters.

Peculiar velocities can also contain useful information about the universe. The connection between correlated peculiar velocities and mass distribution has been suggested as a tool for determining constraints for cosmological parameters using peculiar velocity surveys.

=== Bulk flow ===

The average of the peculiar velocity over a sphere is called the bulk flow. This value can be compared to theories of gravity. Current analysis of experimental bulk flow values are not in good agreement with the Lambda-CDM model.

<doc id="307984" wikidata="Q368583" url="?curid=307984" title="Leopold Auer">
<text>Leopold von Auer (; June 7, 1845July 15, 1930) was a Hungarian violinist, academic, conductor, composer, and instructor. Many of his students went on to become prominent concert performers and teachers.

==Early life and career==
Auer was born in Veszprém, Hungary, 7 June 1845, to a poor Jewish household of painters. He first studied violin with a local concertmaster. He later wrote that the violin was a &quot;logical instrument&quot; for any (musically inclined) Hungarian boy to take up because it &quot;didn&#x27;t cost much.&quot; At the age of 8 Auer continued his violin studies with Dávid Ridley Kohne, who also came from Veszprém, at the Budapest Conservatory. Kohne was concertmaster of the orchestra of the National Opera. A performance by Auer as soloist in the 
Mendelssohn violin concerto attracted the interest of some wealthy music lovers, who gave him a scholarship to go to Vienna for further study. He lived at the home of his teacher, Jakob Dont. Auer wrote that it was Dont who taught him the foundation for his violin technique. In Vienna he also attended quartet classes with Joseph Hellmesberger, Sr.

By the time Auer was 13, the scholarship money had run out. His father decided to launch his career. The income from provincial concerts was barely enough to keep father and son, and a pianist who formed a duo with Leopold, out of poverty. An audition with Henri Vieuxtemps in Graz was a failure, partly because Vieuxtemps&#x27; wife thought so. A visit to Paris proved equally unsuccessful. Auer decided to seek the advice of Joseph Joachim, then royal concertmaster at Hanover. The then king of Hanover was blind and very fond of music. He paid Joachim very well, and on those occasions when Auer also performed for the king, he was also paid enough to support him for a few weeks. The two years Auer spent with Joachim (1861–63, or 1863-1865 according to Auer, 1980, p. 9) proved a turning point in his career. He was already well prepared as a violinist. What proved revelatory was exposure to the world of German music making—a world that stresses musical values over virtuoso glitter. Auer later wrote,

Joachim was an inspiration to me, and opened before my eyes horizons of that greater art of which until then I had lived in ignorance. With him I worked not only with my hands, but with my head as well, studying the scores of the masters, and endeavoring to penetrate the very heart of their works... I [also] played a great deal of chamber music with my fellow students.

Auer spent the summer of 1864 at the spa village of Wiesbaden, where he had been hired to perform. There he met violinist Henryk Wieniawski and pianist brothers Anton Rubinstein and Nicholas Rubinstein, later founder and director of the Moscow Conservatory and conductor of the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. Auer received some informal instruction from Wieniawski. In the summer of 1865 Auer was in another spa village, Baden-Baden, where he met Clara Schumann, Brahms, and Johann Strauss Jr.

There were not so many touring violinists then as there were later, but in Vienna Auer was able to hear Henri Vieuxtemps from Belgium, Antonio Bazzini from Italy, and the Czech Ferdinand Laub; he was especially impressed by Vieuxtemps. Auer gave concerts in 1864 as soloist with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, invited by concertmaster Ferdinand David, conductor Felix &quot;Mendelssohn&#x27;s friend.&quot; At that time, Auer says, Leipzig was &quot;more important, from a musical point of view, than Berlin and even Vienna.&quot; Success led to his becoming, at the age of 19, concertmaster in Düsseldorf. In 1866 he got the same position in Hamburg; he also led a string quartet there.

During May and June 1868, Auer was engaged to play a series of concerts in London. In one concert, he played Beethoven&#x27;s Archduke Trio with pianist Anton Rubinstein and cellist Alfredo Piatti.

==Russia==
Rubinstein was in search for a violin professor for the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, which he had founded in 1862, and he proposed Auer. Auer agreed to a three-year contract, also as soloist at the court of Grand Duchess Helena. At first, music critics in St. Petersburg harshly criticized Auer&#x27;s playing and compared it unfavorably with that of his predecessor, Wieniawski. But Tchaikovsky&#x27;s admiration for Auer&#x27;s playing led to its acceptance. Auer would stay for 49 years (1868-1917). During that time he held the position of first violinist to the orchestra of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. This included the principal venue of the Imperial Ballet and Opera, the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre (until 1886), and later the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, as well as the Imperial Theatres of Peterhof and the Hermitage. Until 1906, Auer played almost all of the violin solos in the ballets performed by the Imperial Ballet, the majority of which were choreographed by Marius Petipa. Before Auer, Vieuxtemps and Wieniawski had played the ballet solos.

Until 1906, Auer was also leader of the string quartet for the Russian Musical Society (RMS). This quartet&#x27;s concerts were as integral a part of the Saint Petersburg musical scene as their counterparts led by Joachim in Berlin. Criticism arose in later years of less-than-perfect ensemble playing and insufficient attention to contemporary Russian music. Nevertheless, Auer&#x27;s group performed quartets by Tchaikovsky, Alexander Borodin, Alexander Glazunov and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The group also played music by Johannes Brahms and Robert Schumann, along with Louis Spohr, Joachim Raff and other lesser known German composers.

Sometime around 1870, Auer decided to convert to Russian Christian Orthodoxy.

At the Conservatory, the leading piano teacher Theodor Leschetizky introduced Auer to Anna Yesipova, who Leschetizky said was his best student. Auer performed sonatas with many great pianists, but his favorite recital partner was Yesipova, with whom he appeared until her death in 1914. Other partners included Anton Rubinstein, Leschetizky, Raoul Pugno, Sergei Taneyev and Eugen d&#x27;Albert. One sonata Auer liked to perform was Tartini&#x27;s &quot;Devil&#x27;s Trill&quot; Sonata, written about 1713. In the 1890s, Auer performed cycles of all 10 Beethoven violin sonatas. A particular favorite of Auer&#x27;s was the &#x27;Kreutzer&#x27; sonata, which Auer had first heard performed in Hanover by Joachim and Clara Schumann.

From 1914 to 1917, on concert tours of Russia, Auer was accompanied by the pianist Wanda Bogutska Stein.

==America==
Up through 1917, Auer did not perform in the United States. He said there was &quot;one serious deterrent — the great number of concerts exacted of the artist in a brief period of three or four months. My friends, Anton Rubinstein, Hans von Bülow. and Henri Wieniawski told [me] that, although their American tours had been most interesting, they were reluctant to accept new engagements because of the severe strain&quot; their tours had been for them. &quot;But in 1918...work in Russia became impossible because of the&quot; Russian Revolution. He then moved to the United States, although because of his age, he did not undertake a wide concert tour. He played at Carnegie Hall on March 23, 1918 and also performed in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. He taught some private students at his home on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. In 1926 he joined the Institute of Musical Art (later to become the Juilliard School). In 1928 he joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He died in 1930 in Loschwitz, a suburb of Dresden, Germany, and was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

==Playing==
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was especially taken with Auer&#x27;s playing. Reviewing an 1874 appearance in Moscow, Tchaikovsky praised Auer&#x27;s &quot;great expressivity, the thoughtful finesse and poetry of the interpretation.&quot; This finesse and poetry came at a tremendous price. Auer suffered as a performer from poorly formed hands. He had to work incessantly, with an iron determination, just to keep his technique in shape. He wrote, &quot;My hands are so weak and their conformation is so poor that when I have not played the violin for several successive days, and then take up the instrument, I feel as if I had altogether lost the facility of playing.&quot;

Despite this handicap, Auer achieved much through constant work. His tone was small but ingratiating, his technique polished and elegant. His playing lacked fire, but he made up for it with a classic nobility. After he arrived in the United States, he made some recordings which bear this out. They show the violinist in excellent shape technically, with impeccable intonation, incisive rhythm and tasteful playing.

His musical tastes were conservative and refined. He liked virtuoso works by Henri Vieuxtemps, such as his three violin concertos, and Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst, and used those works in his teaching. Once a student objected to playing Ernst&#x27;s &quot;Othello Fantasy&quot;, saying it was bad music. Auer did not back down. &quot;You&#x27;ll play it until it sounds like good music,&quot; he thundered at the student, &quot;and you&#x27;ll play nothing else.&quot;

===Bach&#x27;s works===
====Concertos====
Auer never assigned either of Bach&#x27;s solo violin concertos to a student. The Double Concerto, however, was one of his favorites. Auer calls the Double Concerto &quot;the most important&quot; of the three concertos.

====Unaccompanied violin or violin and piano sonatas====
Auer wrote that Ferdinand David &quot;earned the undying gratitude of the violinistic world by [re]discovering the &#x27;solo sonatas for violin&#x27;, BWV 1001-1006, and the &quot;Six sonatas for violin and piano&quot;.
&quot;David edited and published these works, and Joseph Joachim was the first to introduce them to the musical world at large&quot;, making &quot;these compositions ... a fundamental pillar of violin literature.&quot;
Auer puts special emphasis on the Chaconne from Bach&#x27;s fourth sonata for unaccompanied violin (depending on editions, later known as Partita No. 2 in D minor, BWV 1004) together with 33 variations.

===Mozart&#x27;s concertos===
Mozart wrote 5 concertos for violin and orchestra, all in 1775, and a well-appreciated double concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364. Auer (2012) does not mention it, but mentions two of the single-violin concertos, one in D major, No. 4, and one in A major, No. 5. For another, in E-flat major, it turned out that Mozart did not actually write it.

==Conducting==
Auer was also active as a conductor. He was in charge of the Russian Musical Society orchestral concerts intermittently in the 1880s and 90s. He was always willing to mount the podium to accompany a famous foreign soloist—as he did when Joachim visited Russia—and did the same for his students concertizing abroad.

==Teaching==
Auer is remembered as one of the most important pedagogues of the violin, and was one of the most sought-after teachers for gifted students. &quot;Auer&#x27;s position in the history of violin playing is based on his teaching.&quot; Many notable virtuoso violinists were among his students, including Mischa Elman, Konstanty Gorski, Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein, Toscha Seidel, Efrem Zimbalist, Georges Boulanger, Lyubov Streicher, Benno Rabinof, Kathleen Parlow, Julia Klumpke, Thelma Given, Sylvia Lent, Kemp Stillings, Oscar Shumsky, and Margarita Mandelstamm. Among these were &quot;some of the greatest violinists&quot; of the twentieth century.

Babel (1931) describes how in Odessa (now in Ukraine) very promising young violin students such as Elman, Milstein, and Zimbalist were enrolled in the violin class of Pyotr Stolyarsky, and if successful, sent on to Auer in St. Petersburg.

Auer also taught the young Clara Rockmore, who later became one of the world&#x27;s foremost exponents of the theremin. Most of Auer&#x27;s students, like Yuliy Eidlin, who became his assistant and stayed on as an esteemed professor, studied with him at the St. Petersburg Conservatory (even Kathleen Parlow, coming all the way from western Canada), but Georges Boulanger, from Romania, studied with him in Dresden, Germany. Benno Rabinof and Oscar Shumsky, born in the United States, studied with Auer there.

Like pianist Franz Liszt, in his teaching, Auer did not focus on technical matters with his students. Instead, he guided their interpretations and concepts of music. If a student ran into a technical problem, Auer did not offer any suggestions. Neither was he inclined to pick up a bow to demonstrate a passage. Nevertheless, he was a stickler for technical accuracy. Fearing to ask Auer themselves, many students turned to each other for help. (Paradoxically, in the years before 1900 when Auer focused more closely on technical details, he did not turn out any significant students.)

While Auer valued talent, he considered it no excuse for lack of discipline, sloppiness or absenteeism. He demanded punctual attendance. He expected intelligent work habits and attention to detail. Lessons were as grueling, and required as much preparation, as recital performances.

In lieu of weekly lessons, students were required to bring a complete movement of a major work. This usually demanded more than a week to prepare. Once a student felt ready to play this work, he or she had to sign up 10 days prior to the class meeting. The student was expected to have the concert ready and to be dressed accordingly. An accompanist was provided. An audience watched—comprised not only of students and parents, but also often of distinguished guests and prominent musicians. Auer arrived for the lesson punctually; everything was supposed to be in place by the time he arrived. During the lesson, Auer would walk around the room, observing, correcting, exhorting, scolding, shaping the interpretation. &quot;We did not dare cross the threshold of the classroom with a half-ready performance,&quot; one student remembered.

Admission to Auer&#x27;s class was a privilege won by talent. Remaining there was a test of endurance and hard work. Auer could be stern, severe, harsh. One unfortunate student was ejected regularly, with the music thrown after him. Auer valued musical vitality and enthusiasm. He hated lifeless, anemic playing and was not above poking a bow into a student&#x27;s ribs, demanding more &quot;krov.&quot; (The word literally means &quot;blood&quot; but can also be used to mean fire or vivacity.)

While Auer pushed his students to their limits, he also remained devoted to them. He remained solicitous of their material needs. He helped them obtain scholarships, patrons and better instruments. He used his influence in high government offices to obtain residence permits for his Jewish students.

=== Jascha Heifetz and his father in the Conservatory===
There was a somewhat limited area of Russia called the Jewish Pale of Settlement in which Jews were allowed to live. The area consisted approximately of Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus. Around 1900, St. Petersburg had a substantial Jewish community, the largest in Russia outside the Pale. Auer (1923, pp. 156–157) wrote that Jascha, as a boy ten or eleven years old,
was admitted to the Conservatoire without question in view of his talent; but what was to be done with his family? Someone hit upon the happy idea of suggesting that I admit Jascha&#x27;s father, a violinist of forty, into my own class ... This I did, and as a result the law was obeyed while at the same time the Heifetz family was not separated, for it was not legally permissible for the wife and children of a Conservatoire pupil to be separated from their husband and father. However, since the students were without exception expected to attend the obligatory classes in solfeggio, piano, and harmony, and since Papa Heifetz most certainly did not attend any of them ... I had to do battle continually with the management on his account. It was not until the advent of Glazunov, my last director, that I had no further trouble in seeing that the boy remained in his parents&#x27; care until the summer of 1917, when the family was able to go to America.&quot;

Auer shaped his students&#x27; personalities. He gave them style, taste, musical breeding. He also broadened their horizons. He made them read books, guided their behavior and career choices and polished their social graces. He also insisted that his students learn a foreign language if an international career was expected.

Even after a student started a career, Auer would watch with a paternal eye. He wrote countless letters of recommendation to conductors and concert agents. When Mischa Elman was preparing for his London debut, Auer traveled there to coach him. He also continued work with Efrem Zimbalist and Kathleen Parlow after their debuts.

==Dedications==
A number of composers dedicated pieces to Auer. One such case was Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Violin Concerto&quot;, which, however, he initially chose not to play. This was not because he regarded the work as &quot;unplayable&quot;, as some sources say, but because he felt that &quot;some of the passages were not suited to the character of the instrument, and that, however perfectly rendered, they would not sound as well as the composer had imagined&quot;. He did play the work later in his career, with alterations in certain passages that he felt were necessary. Performances of the Tchaikovsky concerto by Auer&#x27;s students (with the exception of Nathan Milstein&#x27;s) were also based on Auer&#x27;s edition. Another work Tchaikovsky had dedicated to Auer was the &quot;Sérénade mélancolique&quot; of 1875. After their conflict over the Violin Concerto, Tchaikovsky also withdrew the &quot;Sérénade&quot;&#x27;s dedication to Auer. British composer Eva Ruth Spalding dedicated one of her string quartets to Auer, who had been her teacher at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.

==Compositions and writings==
Auer wrote a small number of works for his instrument, including the &quot;Rhapsodie hongroise&quot; for violin and piano. He also wrote a number of cadenzas for other composers&#x27; violin concertos including those by Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart&#x27;s third. He wrote three books: &quot;Violin Playing as I Teach It&quot; (1920), &quot;My Long Life in Music&quot; (1923) and &quot;Violin Master Works and Their Interpretation&quot; (1925). He also wrote an arrangement for Paganini&#x27;s 24th Caprice (with Schumann&#x27;s piano accompaniment) later performed by Jascha Heifetz, Henryk Szeryng and Ivry Gitlis, in which the final variation is removed and his own composed. There are also alterations to various passages throughout the piece. Auer edited much of the standard repertoire, concertos, short pieces and all of Bach&#x27;s solo works. His editions are published mostly by Carl Fischer. He also transcribed a great many works for the violin including some of Chopin&#x27;s piano preludes.

===Evaluation and selection of concertos and (Beethoven) romances===
In &quot;Violin Master Works...&quot;, Auer 2012, Auer gives some rankings. Chapter X is on &quot;Three Master Concertos,&quot; namely Beethoven&#x27;s, Brahms&#x27;, and Mendelssohn&#x27;s. To these three, Joachim adds a fourth, by Max Bruch. Auer&#x27;s Chapter XI on &quot;The Bruch Concertos&quot; mentions two. Bruch&#x27;s First, in G minor, Op. 26, Auer says is probably the next-most played after the three &quot;master&quot; concertos. Steinberg (1998) does not mention Bruch concertos after the first, although both he and Auer mention the &quot;Scottish Fantasy&quot; for violin and orchestra. See above about Bach&#x27;s and Mozart&#x27;s violin concertos.
Beethoven wrote two Romances for violin and orchestra, Romance No. 1 in G, Op. 40, and Romance No. 2 in F, Op. 50. Auer (pp. 52–54) mentions the two Romances as scored for violin and piano in versions he had edited, but the text is about the orchestral version.

==Relatives==

Auer&#x27;s first wife, Nadine Pelikan, was Russian. The jazz vibraphonist Vera Auer is a niece of Leopold Auer. The actor Mischa Auer (born Mischa Ounskowsky) was his grandson. The composer György Ligeti (the name Ligeti is a Hungarian equivalent of the German name Auer) was his great-grandnephew. Prominent Hungarian philosopher and lecturer Ágnes Heller mentions that prominent Hungarian violinist Leopold Auer was related to her family on her mother&#x27;s side.

Auer&#x27;s second wife, Wanda Bogutska Stein (Auer), was his piano accompanist on some concert tours (in Russia up to 1917) and later on some recordings.

<text>Meiko () is an American singer-songwriter residing in London, England. She independently released a self-titled album on September 1, 2007. All of the tracks from the LP have been featured in major network TV shows. Her second full-length, titled &quot;The Bright Side&quot;, was released through Fantasy Records on May 15, 2012, and a single from the album, &quot;Stuck On You&quot;, reached No. 1 on the combined Japanese AirPlay Chart and No. 1 on the International Chart in Japan.

==Early life==
Meiko was born in Roberta, Georgia and raised by her father. Meiko first stepped in front of an audience at the age of eight, singing &quot;White Christmas&quot; for parishioners of a Southern Baptist church. In the years that followed, she performed everywhere from talent shows to Little League baseball parks. When she was not performing, she was practicing – spending countless hours singing into the family&#x27;s clothes dryer. &quot;Great acoustics,&quot; she insisted. She soon developed an interest in writing songs and enlisted the help of her dad, who taught her how to play guitar on his Gibson six-string. When she was thirteen, he bought her a guitar of her own. A flood of songs followed. &quot;As soon as I learned a new chord,&quot; she says, &quot;I wrote a new song.&quot; She has one sibling, designer Kelly Nishimoto.

==Music career==
===2007–2013: Beginnings and self-titled debut studio album===
At age eighteen, after a brief stop in Miami, she moved to Los Angeles, playing venues all over Southern California and writing at a prolific pace. She performed (and bartended) at Hollywood&#x27;s Hotel Café, where she still performs regularly.

In early 2007, Meiko performed at the Sundance Film Festival and caught the ear of Paste Magazine editor Josh Jackson, who declared her a &quot;big success story&quot; waiting to happen, predicting it was &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before she found her way onto Nic Harcourt&#x27;s influential &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot; radio program on KCRW.

In September 2007, she toured nationally with Brett Dennen and in October, toured the U.S. as the opener for Mat Kearney.

In 2008, Meiko performed at the Sundance Film Festival and SXSW, and participated in the nationwide Hotel Café Tour, which also included Rachael Yamagata, Ingrid Michaelson, Cary Brothers, and Sara Bareilles.

In June 2008 Meiko signed a recording deal with MySpace Records/DGC, who released her album in partnership with Lucky Ear Music (Meiko&#x27;s own indie label). The Lucky Ear/MySpace/DGC release has been remixed, premastered and includes re-recorded versions and a new track, &quot;Boys with Girlfriends&quot;. The digital album re-release was August 5, 2008.

Also in August, she toured the U.S. (Three dates in Southern California) with Joe Purdy, Chris Seefried and Jay Nash. In the fall of 2008, Meiko joined another Hotel Cafe Tour – this time around the trek featured an all-female lineup. Meiko was the only artist performing all dates of the tour. From February–March 2009, Meiko performed on a string of U.S. dates in support of Joshua Radin. In May 2009, she embarked on her first-ever headlining U.S. tour. In June 2009, Meiko hit the road with Eric Hutchinson, and in July 2009, she performed a string of shows in the UK before playing in the United States territory of Guam. In October and November 2009 Meiko toured the U.S. with Jewel.

Meiko&#x27;s album was digitally released in Australia on October 9, 2009, and reached No. 2 on the iTunes Australia Singer-Songwriter Albums chart. The album was physically released October 23, 2009.

After spending most of the first half of 2010 writing new material, Meiko entered a Los Angeles recording studio in September 2010 with producers Styrofoam (Jimmy Eat World, Postal Service, Of Montreal) and Jimmy Messer (Kelly Clarkson, Neon Trees) to begin recording songs for her second album.

She signed a new recording contract with Fantasy Records/Concord Records in late 2011, with her second album titled
&quot;The Bright Side&quot; released on May 15, 2012.

===2014–2016: Breakthrough with &quot;Dear You&quot;===
Meiko released her third full-length album, titled &quot;Dear You&quot;, on October 14, 2014, through Fantasy Records/Concord Records. Remixes of &quot;Be Mine&quot;, the first single from the album, reached No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart.

Meiko decided to part ways with her label in early 2015, and independently released a live EP titled &quot;Live Songs From The Hotel Cafe&quot; on October 23, 2015. The 7-song release features six live versions of fan favorites recorded during various Meiko concerts at the venerable L.A. venue The Hotel Café, including the previously unreleased show-closer &quot;You Gotta F**kin’ Tip.&quot; An additional brand new live track titled &quot;Perfect Fit&quot; is included as well.

Meiko independently released a new album titled &quot;Moving Day&quot; on June 24, 2016.

According to her website, Meiko gave birth to her first child on July 15, 2016.

===2018–present: Cover songs and recent developments ===
On January 26, 2018, Meiko released a cover of The Cranberries single &quot;Zombie&quot; through the independent label Chesky Records. The track will also be featured on Meiko&#x27;s &quot;Playing Favorites&quot; album, due out on May 25, 2018, through Chesky Records.

On March 16, 2018, Meiko released another song called &quot;Back in the Game&quot; through the independent label WAX Ltd.

May 25, 2018 saw the release of Meiko&#x27;s &quot;Playing Favorites&quot; album through independent label Chesky Records. The 12-song collection of live cover songs debuted at No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heat seekers Albums Chart. It was released on limited-edition pink vinyl on December 14, 2018.

On December 7, 2018, Meiko released a new holiday single called &quot;Merry Christmas Wherever You Are&quot;.

Meiko independently released a new original single titled &quot;Gimme Gimme&quot; on April 26, 2019.

She released a full new album on May 21, 2019, called &quot;In Your Dreams&quot;.

She released a three-song EP on May 26, 2020, called &quot;Weird World&quot;.

==Origins of name==
Meiko is of Japanese heritage; her maternal grandmother from Japan died when she was eight years old. According to Meiko, her grandmother felt a strong urge to assimilate into American culture and only spoke English to her children, never Japanese, and so, Meiko and her mother never learned much of the language or the culture. After her grandmother&#x27;s death, she and her sister began to refer to one another as Meiko and Keiko, both Japanese names. However, without a Japanese speaker to help them, they mispronounced them as &quot;mee-ko&quot; and &quot;kee-ko,&quot; whereas they are actually pronounced &quot;may-ko&quot; and &quot;kay-ko.&quot; Though Meiko later learned they&#x27;d been pronouncing the names incorrectly, they &quot;didn&#x27;t have the heart to change it.&quot;

==Instruments==
Meiko has played a Gibson 1951 J-50 and has played many live shows with her Gibson 1942 LG2 which &quot;doesn&#x27;t have a pickup.&quot; Meiko currently plays a Gibson B-25.

<doc id="307996" wikidata="Q1068387" url="?curid=307996" title="Supercruise">
<text>Supercruise is sustained supersonic flight of a supersonic aircraft without using afterburner. Many supersonic military aircraft are not capable of supercruise and can maintain Mach 1+ flight only in short bursts with afterburners. Aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird are designed to cruise at supersonic speed with afterburners enabled.

Some fighter jets are capable of supercruise but only at high altitudes and in a clean configuration, so the term may imply &quot;a significant increase in effective combat speed with a full weapons load over existing types&quot;. One of the pre-eminent military examples of supercruise is the F-22 Raptor, for which supercruise was defined as &quot;the ability to cruise at speeds of one and a half times the speed of sound or greater without the use of afterburner for extended periods in combat configuration.&quot;

One of the best-known examples of an aircraft capable of supercruise, and the only notable non-military example, was the Concorde. Due to its long service as a commercial airliner, Concorde holds the record for the most time spent supersonic; more than all other western aircraft combined.

==History==

A few early supersonic aircraft attained speeds just beyond the speed of sound without using afterburning.

On 3August 1954, a Gerfaut research aircraft powered by an SNECMA Atar 101D2A engine exceeded Mach1 in level flight without using afterburning.

The first production aircraft to exceed Mach1 in level flight without afterburning was the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter after its J65 engine was replaced with a J79. The maximum speed without afterburning was Mach1.05.

The P.1 prototype of the English Electric Lightning, powered by non-afterburning Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines, exceeded Mach1 on 11August 1954. A week previously, on 4August, the P.1, &quot;WG760&quot; flown by Roland Beamont on its maiden flight, had unknowingly exceeded Mach1 in a climb. During development testing at English Electric it was established that the Lightning had a stabilized speed capability in level flight, without afterburning, of about Mach1.2 and for the T.4 (2-seat trainer) 1.08. Flying just above the speed of sound without using afterburning, although done by the contractor as part of some flight trials does not appear to have been relevant to the operational capability of the aircraft. Service trials established intercept profiles for subsonic and supersonic targets at different altitudes with subsonic cruising at a maximum of Mach0.95 with all supersonic speeds beyond subsonic cruise attained with afterburning.

All the Fairey Delta 2 initial supersonic test flying to Mach1.1 was done without afterburning. Selecting the afterburner, which initially only had a maximum selection with no intermediate positions, would have caused an uncontrollable rapid acceleration to potentially hazardous speeds; i.e., too far beyond previously established flutter-free speeds.

Only the supersonic transports (SST), Concorde, and the second version of the Tu-144 (the Tu-144D) spent most of their time cruising at their design speeds without needing afterburning. Afterburning was added to Concorde for take-off to cope with weight increases that came after the initial design. It was also used to accelerate through the high-drag transonic speed range, not because the extra thrust was required, but because it was available and improved the operating economics. The redesigned Tu-144D used engines with no afterburners which, together with other improvements, increased the full payload range from (Concorde&#x27;s operational range was ).

==Military use==
The United States Air Force set supercruise as a core requirement for the Advanced Tactical Fighter program, which resulted in the F-22 Raptor. The F-22 Raptor&#x27;s supercruise capabilities are touted as a major performance advantage over other fighters, with supercruise being demonstrated exceeding Mach1.5. Supercruise capability provides advantages for stealth aircraft because an afterburner plume reflects radar signals and creates a significant infrared signature. Virtually all fighters prior to the F-22 cruise at Mach0.8–0.9 while carrying a normal weapons load.


There are a few engines in production that are designed to facilitate tactically significant supercruise:
* The Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120 was used on the IAI Super Phantom 2000 that had supercruise capability.
* The two Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 that power the F-22 Raptor make it the most capable supercruise-capable fighter aircraft in service. The F-22 Raptor can supercruise above Mach 1.5 without external stores.
* The EJ200 engine built by EuroJet Turbo GmbH mounted in the Eurofighter Typhoon. It is capable of supercruising at Mach 1.5 with an air superiority missile load. Typhoon pilots have stated that Mach 1.3 is attainable in combat configuration with external stores.
* The General Electric F414G in the JAS 39 Gripen NG is designed for supercruise and has achieved Mach 1.2, or Mach 1.1 with an air to air missile load.
* The two Snecma M88s that power the Dassault Rafale enable the Rafale to supercruise with four missiles and a belly drop tank.

Independently, Russia is working on &quot;izdeliye&quot; 30 (after AL-31F and AL-41F derivatives modifications, like &quot;izdeliye&quot; 117S turbofan) and RD-33MKRU Morskaja Osa; an all-new AL-41 engine with a complete redesign is underway to add supercruise ability to the Sukhoi Su-57. This has yet to bear fruit, but the stop-gap 117S engine, produced by this program, may achieve the supercruise goal already. While testing a Su-35BM fighter equipped with these engines, it managed to accelerate past Mach 1 without using the afterburner, suggesting that it had supercruise capability. It has yet to be seen whether this will be possible with a combat load.

<text>ETA Systems was a supercomputer company spun off from Control Data Corporation (CDC) in the early 1980s in order to regain a footing in the supercomputer business. They successfully delivered the ETA-10, but lost money continually while doing so. CDC management eventually gave up and folded the company.

==Historical development==
Seymour Cray left CDC in the early 1970s when they refused to continue funding of his CDC 8600 project. Instead they continued with the CDC STAR-100 while Cray went off to build the Cray-1. Cray&#x27;s machine was much faster than the STAR, and soon CDC found itself pushed out of the supercomputing market.

William Norris was convinced the only way to regain a foothold would be to spin off a division that would be free from management prodding. In order to regain some of the small-team flexibility that seemed essential to progress in the field, ETA was created in 1983 with the mandate to build a 10 GFLOPS machine by 1986.

In April 1989 CDC decided to shut down the ETA operation and keep a bare-bones continuation effort alive at CDC. At shutdown, 7 liquid-cooled and 27 air-cooled machines had been sold. At this point ETA had the best price/performance ratio of any supercomputer on the market, and its initial software problems appeared to be finally sorted out. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter CDC exited the supercomputer market entirely, giving away remaining ETA machines free to high schools through the SuperQuest computer science competition.

==Products==
ETA had only one product, the ETA-10. It was a derivative of the CDC Cyber 205 supercomputer, and deliberately kept compatibility with it. Like the Cyber 205, the ETA-10 did not use vector registers as in the Cray machines, but instead used pipelined memory operations to a high-bandwidth main memory. The basic layout was a shared-memory multiprocessor with up to 8 CPUs, each capable of 4 double-precision or 8 single-precision operations per clock cycle, and up to 18 I/O processors.

The main reason for the ETA-10&#x27;s speed was the use of liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling in some models to cool the CPUs. Even though it was based on then-current CMOS technologies, the low temperature allowed the CPUs to operate with a ~7 ns cycle time, so a fully loaded ETA-10 was capable of about 9.1 GFLOPS. The design goal had been 10 GFLOPS, so the design was technically a failure. Two LN2-cooled models were designated ETA-10E and ETA-10G. Two slower, lower-cost air-cooled versions, the ETA-10Q and ETA-10P (code named &quot;Piper&quot;) were also marketed.

The planned successor to the ETA-10 was the 30 GFLOPS ETA-30.

==Software==
Software for the ETA-10 line was initially regarded as a disaster. When CDC and ETA first designed the ETA architecture, they made the conscious decision not to merely port the CDC VSOS operating system from the existing CDC Cyber 205. It was felt by both the vendor, and the existing customer base (who wrongly believed that their vendor knew best), that a new OS needed to be written to extract the best performance from the hardware.

When the first ETA-10 E initially shipped in 1986 there was no operating system for the machines. Programs had to be loaded one at a time from an attached Apollo Computer workstation, run, and then the supercomputer rebooted to run the next program.

At the time Unix was making major inroads into the supercomputing fields, but ETA decided to write their own EOS operating system, which wasn&#x27;t ready when the first machines were delivered in late 1986 and early 1987. An operating system based on UNIX System V became available in 1988, as a result of porting work done under contract by the Canadian firm HCR Corporation, at which point it looked like the machine might finally succeed. Many sites that had refused to pay for their machines due to the low quality of EOS found ETA&#x27;s UNIX completely usable and were willing to accept delivery.

ETA&#x27;s demise was not based solely on operating system choice or existence. The Fortran compiler (ftn200) had not changed significantly from the CDC205. This compiler retained vendor-specific programming performance features (known as the Q8* subroutine calls) in an era when supercomputer users were realizing the necessity of source code portability between architectures. Additionally, the compiler optimizations were not keeping up with existing technology as shown by the Japanese supercomputer vendors such as NEC, or at Cray Research and the newer minisupercomputer makers.

In general, computer hardware manufacturers prior and up to that period tended to be weak on software. Libraries and available commercial and non-commercial (soon to be called open-source) applications help an installed base of machines. CDC was relatively weak in this area.

==Naming the Firm==
Neil Lincoln, chief architect, asserts that ETA is not an acronym, and otherwise means nothing, not even the well known acronym of &quot;estimated time of arrival.&quot; In point of fact, he says that he would not have named the firm that so as to dissociate it from, ETA, the Basque separatist group, or the &quot;Eta&quot;, the Japanese social minority (especially as Japan was considered a market). According to one of the CPU designers at ETA, Neil told a story that his sons actually came up with the name: apparently a linotype machine has characters arranged in the order of frequency used in the English language and the first three letters were used. 

Another theory asserts the name was chosen based on the frequency of English alphabet letters due in part to the then current popularity of Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s 1980 book Gödel, Escher, Bach which used ETAOIN, etc., to capitalize on popularity and current hip-ness.

A third, completely plausible theory, is that ETA was a successor name to the much earlier Engineering Research Associates ERA: Engineering Technology Associates. Norris and others have denied this.

<text>The Moray Firth (; , or ) is a roughly triangular inlet (or firth) of the North Sea, north and east of Inverness, which is in the Highland council area of the north of Scotland. 

It is the largest firth in Scotland, stretching from Duncansby Head (near John o&#x27; Groats) in the north, in the Highland council area, and Fraserburgh in the east, in the Aberdeenshire council area, to Inverness and the Beauly Firth in the west. 

Therefore, three council areas have Moray Firth coastline: Highland to the west and north of the Moray Firth and Highland, Moray and Aberdeenshire to the south. The firth has more than of coastline, much of which is cliff.

==Etymology==
The firth is named after the 10th-century Province of Moray, whose name in turn is believed to derive from the sea of the firth itself. The local names &quot;Murar&quot; or &quot;Morar&quot; are suggested to derive from , the Gaelic for sea, whilst &quot;Murav&quot; and &quot;Morav&quot; are believed to be rooted in Celtic words (sea) and (side), condensed to &quot;Mur&#x27;av&quot; for sea-side. The firth has, in the past, been referred to as the Murro Firth and the Morra Firth. &#x27;Murro&#x27; and &#x27;Morra&#x27; being variants of Moray; these older variations are also shown in older names for Morayshire itself, such as Morrowshire.

==Geography==
 
A number of rivers flow into the Moray Firth, including the River Ness, the River Findhorn and the River Spey. Various smaller firths and bays are inlets of the firth, including the Cromarty Firth and the Dornoch Firth. The Pentland Firth has its eastern mouth at the Moray Firth&#x27;s northern boundary.

The Moray Firth is effectively two firths, the Inner Moray Firth , which was traditionally known as the Firth of Inverness, and the Outer Moray Firth which is more open North Sea water. The name &quot;Firth of Inverness&quot; is rarely found on modern maps, but extended from the Beauly Firth in the west, to Chanonry Point in the east.

The Moray Firth is visible for considerable distances, including a long range view from as far to the east as Longman Hill. From Buckie, on a clear day it is possible to see Wick in the far north of Scotland more than away. 

From Lossiemouth it is possible to see the hills of Caithness and the hills are easily identified, one being Morven and the other being Scaraben. From Burghead, the white mass of Dunrobin Castle can just be made out in the distance on a very clear day; from Nairn, the two red bands on the Tarbat Ness Lighthouse around away, can be seen with binoculars.

The Great Channel in the Inner Moray Firth, was dredged by engineers in 1917 for the safe passage of ships that wanted to avoid the long and dangerous passage around the north of Scotland, by transiting the Caledonian Canal. The Channel went from the entrance of Munlochy Bay to the Meikle Mee Starboard Hand Mark, but was not maintained and filled in very quickly.

==Geology==
The Moray Firth is of tectonic origin, the formation is related in part to the Helmsdale Fault. For some time during the last ice age, the whole of the present day Moray Firth was a huge glacier. Nevertheless, the inner part and its side-inlets, the Cromarty Firth and Dornoch Firth, are true fjords themselves. 

Though there is a reasonable tide with mean tide ranges of about three metres (ten feet), only some of the rivers draining into the bay have estuaries. Masses of sediment from the adjacent mountains have formed spits around several mouths. Those of River Ness and River Carron have significantly narrowed the fjords they enter.

== Conservation and economy ==

The Moray Firth is one of the most important places on the British coast for observing dolphins and whales. The most common species are the bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise, with occasional sightings of the common dolphin and minke whale. 

The popular wildlife viewing area located at Chanonry Point host some spectacular displays of dolphins within the inner Moray Firth. Also, visitor centres at Spey Bay and North Kessock are run by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, where dolphins and other wildlife can often be seen. The old jetty at the Fort George Point is the location of the Dolphin Research Centre, with leading marine biologist Prof. 

Greame Taylor working part-time studying hunting and breeding habits and part-time working with the Community Council giving tours and teaching the ways of the dolphin.

It is also an important oil field and fishing grounds. The Beatrice oil field about 20 miles south of Wick and east of Helmsdale was the closest of the North Sea oil fields; since being decommissioned in 2017 it is the site of the Beatrice Wind Farm. Much of the fishing industry focuses on scallops and Norway lobsters. The area also contains the Moray East (completed) and Moray West (to be completed in 2025) offshore wind farms.

The Inner Moray Firth is designated as a special protection area for wildlife conservation purposes.
The Moray Firth contains a special area of conservation (SAC) designated under the EU Habitats Directive, which is one of the largest marine protection areas in Europe. The SAC protects the inner waters of the Moray Firth, from a line between Lossiemouth (on the south coast) and Helmsdale (on the north coast) westwards.

<text>The U.S. state of New Jersey is located in the Northeastern United States and is part of the Mid-Atlantic region.

==Official symbols==
New Jersey does not have a state song.

The square dance is &quot;the American Folk Dance of the State of New Jersey&quot;.

==Indigenous music==

The Lenape people were the original inhabitants of present-day New Jersey and surrounding areas to the north, south, and west. Social tribal songs were often named after things such as animals, other tribes or groups, and even food. These songs were performed in groups and were usually not long. However, the performances and dancing would linger. A significant amount of this part of Lenape culture was lost as Dutch and later British settlers moved into the region and pushed the Lenape west. Eventually the U.S. Government resettled the majority of the Lenape in Oklahoma.

The Ramapough Mountain Indians and the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape are Lenape descendants that are recognized as tribes by the State of New Jersey, but not the U.S. Government. The Powhatan Renape Nation are descendants of the Powhatan people of Virginia. A group of the Powhatan migrated to present day southern New Jersey and are recognized as a tribe by the New Jersey, but not Federal, government.

==Classical and operatic music==
The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, based at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the New Jersey State Opera, The Baroque Orchestra of New Jersey, and the New Jersey Ballet are all located in the Newark area. These groups regularly travel to different venues throughout the state to give performances.

The Cape May Music Festival is held every year at the Mid-Atlantic Center for Arts and Humanities in Cape May, New Jersey, featuring classical and chamber music. The South Orange Performing Arts Center in South Orange, New Jersey, features classical soloists and ensembles. Other classical music performing groups throughout New Jersey include The Bay-Atlantic Symphony Orchestra, the Garden State Philharmonic, the Philharmonic of Southern New Jersey, and the Princeton Symphony Orchestra. These music groups perform throughout the state, as well as present shows at several universities which serve as home base for some of these groups.

American composer John Philip Sousa would perform concerts on the lawn of the historic Congress Hall (Cape May hotel).

World-famous opera singer Frederica von Stade was born in Somerville, New Jersey. Acclaimed operatic tenor Michael Fabiano was born in Montclair and still resides in the state.

In 1796, William Dunlap of Perth Amboy wrote the first professional opera in the United States called, &quot;The Archers&quot;.

==Folk and bluegrass music==
The Folk and Bluegrass scene in New Jersey consists of performances at festivals and small venues throughout the state, mostly in small cities and college towns with more active music scenes. Some of these towns and cities are Montclair, Hoboken, New Brunswick, and Princeton.

There is little information about early folk music in New Jersey. One of the more documented regions for early folk music in the colonial era is from the Pine Barrens and shore regions of southern New Jersey. It was there, in the sandy, dense forests and small shore towns, that the earliest settlers played musical elements of their home countries as well as sang stories of the new land they called home. Some examples ranged from Scots/Irish fiddle tunes to Yiddish and Lithuanian songs. It was in this region that stories were sung and legends like the Jersey Devil were born.

Various workshops, music development institutions, and festivals throughout New Jersey have celebrated folk and bluegrass music for decades. The Folk Project has hosted many folk music singers in the past years including; Richard Shindell, Bob Franke, and Odetta. The New Jersey Folk Festival is held every year at Rutgers University, celebrating a variety of artists, both nationally or locally known. Jim Murphy and The Pine Barons have been playing bluegrass at venues in southern New Jersey for over forty years. The Delaware Valley Bluegrass Festival takes place annually at the Salem County Fairgrounds in Woodstown, New Jersey. The Hurdy Gurdy Folk Music Club celebrates folk music in the northern part of the state. The Irish festival at the Jersey Shore celebrates Irish folk music every summer in Sea Girt.

John Dull, a Rutherford native, is a well known folk artist who has worked with a wide variety of musicians in many genres.

David Grisman, born in Hackensack, is a celebrated mandolinist and Newgrass composer. Another highly respected New Jersey folk artist is Meg Baird. John Gorka, a leader of the New Folk movement, was born in Edison. New Jersey folk singer and activist Catherine Moon has released several critically acclaimed independent albums. Atlantic City native and folk singer Jim Albertson sings songs that tell stories of South Jersey. The variety of folk and bluegrass music reflects the cultural past of America and New Jersey, including stories of the widely varied ethnic groups in the state, as well as revivalist styles.

==Jazz==
In the early 20th century, Newark was an important center for jazz innovation with other smaller New Jersey towns also providing talent. James P. Johnson of New Brunswick and other pioneers helped invent stride. Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, who grew up in Newark, played stride as well as other styles of jazz piano. Donald Lambert of Princeton was another famous jazz pianist. Jazz alto saxophonist Richie Cole grew up and began playing in Mercer County.

<text>The ETA10 is a vector supercomputer designed, manufactured, and marketed by ETA Systems, a spin-off division of Control Data Corporation (CDC). The ETA10 was an evolution of the CDC Cyber 205, which can trace its origins back to the CDC STAR-100, one of the first vector supercomputers to be developed.

CDC announced it was creating ETA Systems, and a successor to the Cyber 205, on 18 April 1983 at the Frontiers of Supercomputing conference, held at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. It was then referred to tentatively as the Cyber 2XX, and later as the GF-10, before it was named the ETA10. Prototypes were operational in mid-1986, and the first delivery was made in December 1986. The supercomputer was formally announced in April 1987 at an event held at its first customer installation, the Florida State University, Tallahassee&#x27;s Scientific Computational Research Institute. On 17 April 1989, CDC abruptly closed ETA Systems due to ongoing financial losses, and discontinued production of the ETA10. Many of its users, such as Florida State University, negotiated Cray hardware in exchange.

==Historical development==
CDC had a strong history of creating powerful supercomputers, starting with the CDC 6600. One of the most famous computer architects to emerge from CDC was Seymour Cray. After a disagreement with CDC management regarding the development of the CDC 8600, he went on to form his own supercomputer company, Cray Research. Meanwhile, work continued at CDC in developing a high-end supercomputer, the CDC STAR-100—led by another famous architect, Neil Lincoln. Cray Research&#x27;s Cray-1 vector supercomputer was successful, beating CDC&#x27;s STAR-100. CDC responded with derivatives of the STAR, the Cyber 203 and 205. The Cyber 205 was moderately successful against the Cray-1&#x27;s successor, the Cray X-MP. It became apparent to CDC&#x27;s top management that it needed to decrease the development time for the next generation computer—thus a new approach was considered for the follow-on to the Cyber 205.

After spinning off from CDC in September 1983, ETA set a goal of producing a supercomputer with a cycle time less than 10ns. To accomplish this, several innovations were made. Among these was the use of liquid nitrogen for cooling the CMOS-based CPUs.

The ETA10 successfully met the company&#x27;s initial goals (10 GFLOPS), with some models achieving a cycle time of about 7 ns (143 MHz) - considered rapid by mid-1980s standards. They delivered seven liquid nitrogen-cooled versions and 27 smaller, air-cooled versions. The CMOS circuits produced only a fraction of the heat of previous ICs. The planned 1987 follow-on was supposed to be designated Cyber 250 or ETA30, as in 30 GFLOPS. ETA was eventually reincorporated back into CDC, ceasing operations on April 17, 1989.

==Operating systems and applications==
The ETA10 series could run either ETA&#x27;s EOS operating system, which was widely criticized for various problems, or a port by Lachman Associates, a software personnel firm, of UNIX System V (Release 3). While EOS suffered a reputation for poor quality, ETA&#x27;s UNIX was better received by customers.

EOS was preceded by and was binary executable compatible with the CDC VSOS operating system for Cyber 205. Like VSOS, EOS had demand paged virtual memory (the VS part) with 2 page sizes for improved virtual memory performance with the ETA&#x27;s faster hardware pipelines. Though it had roots in the interactive Livermore Time Sharing System (LTSS), VSOS was focused as a batch-oriented operating system. VSOS was not run at very many institutions and its application-oriented performance, while the historic focus for supercomputing, set its features behind the times because of its limited user base.

To address this feature deficiency and to make the operating system more &quot;normal to use&quot;, the VSOS characteristics were married with UNIX characteristics in a hybrid OS. The OS was intended to be effective for both batch work that drove the hardware to its maximum or for interactive use in development from a UNIX workstation.

EOS was written mainly in Cybil, a Pascal-like programming language created by Control Data for its later Cyber operating systems. It was a new effort, as VSOS was implemented in IMPL, a Fortran-like language created for the LTSS implementation. The command line appearance of all these systems was similar to the lineage going back to UNIVAC EXEC*8.

EOS was released with early hardware deliveries and had some of the typical problems for early OS releases. Some customers delayed payment for their supercomputer installations.

ETA later released a port of UNIX for the ETA-10 line, which was more quickly accepted by their customer base. However, this port started as a single-processor kernel which did not transparently exploit the hardware architecture with up to 8 large application CPUs for applications.

===Criticism===
Despite eventual adoption of UNIX, poorly developed system software remained one flaw of the ETA10 line. According to one description of the system:
:Without NSF funding, the von Neumann center could be doomed. &quot;I don’t think we can function without federal support,&quot; says Cohen. Even if the center does operate at a vastly reduced level, its machines continue to be plagued by software problems. The NSF review panel found that the ETA10 suffered a software failure once every 30 hours, and that its ability to run programs on more than one of its eight processors at any one time was poor. Although its hardware is still considered state-of-the-art, the overall package is an &quot;extremely immature computer system,&quot; the panel concluded.

The late delivery and operating problems contributed to this demise as well as management problems.

It is a mistake to believe that ETA&#x27;s demise was based solely on operating system choice or existence. The Fortran compiler (ftn200) had not changed from the CDC205. This compiler retained vendor-specific programming performance features (known as the Q8* subroutine calls) in an era when supercomputer users were realizing the necessity of source code portability between architectures. Additionally, the compiler optimizations were not keeping up with existing technology as shown by the Japanese supercomputer vendors as well as the newer minisupercomputer makers and competition at Cray Research.

In general, computer hardware manufacturers prior and up to that period tended to be weak on software. Libraries and available commercial and non-commercial applications help build an installed user base. CDC was relatively weak in this area, and some of the best operating systems that CDC provided to customers were productized versions of an OS written by Lawrence Livermore Laboratories.

According to NASA, the hardware was very poorly designed, and failed to complete any acceptance tests at the Ames Research Center. This one event is considered among CDC insiders to be the downfall of ETA, which folded as a result of NASA saying no (and in a domino effect DOD, etc.).

==Models==
There were four models of the ETA10. Any of these models could be built in either single- or multi-processor configurations.

The Models E and G were the highest-performing members of the ETA10 line, and used liquid nitrogen cooling to achieve rapid cycle times. The first to be announced was the Model E, whose processors had a 10.5 ns clock cycle (approximately 95 MHz). The Model E could support up to eight processors, for a peak performance of 8.32 GFLOPS. The later Model G, whose processors had a 7 ns clock cycle (approximately 142 MHz), had a peak performance of 10.3 GFLOPS in its maximal eight-processor configuration.

The Models P and Q were slower, less-costly, air-cooled versions. The Model P, codenamed &quot;Piper&quot;, had processors with a 24 ns clock cycle. The faster, two-processor Model Q had a 19 ns clock cycle.

==Performance==
Between the highest-performing, liquid-nitrogen cooled models (ETA10-E, G, &quot;etc.&quot;) and the cheaper, air-cooled models (ETA10-P, Q, &quot;etc.&quot;), the ETA10 line spanned a 27:1 performance range. Peak performance on the top-of-the-line models reached 10 GFLOPS.

A single-processor ETA10 achieved 52 MFLOPS on the LINPACK benchmark for a matrix with a size of 100 × 100.

==Description==
The ETA10 was a multiprocessor system that supported up to eight CPUs. Each CPU was similar to that of a two-lane Cyber 205. One of the main innovations of the ETA10 was how the CPU was implemented: the CPU was made of 250 CMOS gate array integrated circuits mounted on a 44-layer printed circuit board (PCB). Each gate array contained 20,000 gates and was fabricated using 1.25-micrometre (μm) technology that was accessible from the VHSIC program at Honeywell. In contrast, mainstream commercial technology at the time was in the 3 to 5 μm range.

CMOS circuitry, which was not typically used in vector supercomputer CPUs at the time, was chosen because of the high density achievable, which reduces both the on-chip and off-chip delay. The CPU delays were managed through careful tuning of each PCB manufactured in conjunction with the logic technology and incorporated two key technologies known as JTAG and BIST. The gate arrays were designed using a combination of internally developed simulator and placement tools, and one of the first commercial electronic design automation tools (an application for schematic capture) from Mentor Graphics. Prior to the use of schematic capture at ETA, designers used textual netlists to describe the interconnection of the logic circuits.

However, CMOS circuitry at that time was significantly slower than that of bipolar circuitry, especially the emitter-coupled logic that was widely used in vector supercomputer CPUs at the time. To compensate for this, the CPU was immersed in -196.15 °C liquid nitrogen for cooling. Although such cooling could potentially speed up the CMOS logic by a factor of four, in practice the liquid nitrogen cooling yielded an approximately twofold speed increase over air-cooled systems. However, because liquid nitrogen cooling yielded only marginal performance benefits, none of the ETA10 systems used such cooling for either the local or shared memories. It is of particular note that in order for this type of cooling to be effective, a closed-loop system was required. ETA had to innovate to make this possible, since there were not any commercially available solutions in the market. The 44-layer PCB was also innovative, and ETA had to develop new processes to manufacture it.

Each CPU had its own 4 million word local memory built from SRAM ICs. Each CPU is also connected to a 256 million word shared memory built from DRAM ICs. In addition to these memories, there is a &quot;communication buffer&quot; used for CPU synchronization and other multiprocessor-related protocol communication. I/O was facilitated by one to eighteen I/O processors that each have a direct path to the shared memory. The ETA10 used fiber-optic lines for communication between the CPUs and I/O devices, a novel approach for systems interconnection in the 1980s.

==Installations==
Before ETA Systems was reincorporated into CDC, a total of 25 systems were delivered. Among the recipients were:
* Florida State University (took delivery of the first ETA10 system, serial number 1, on January 5, 1987)
* Johnson Space Center
* John von Neumann Center (JVNC), (when no buyers could be found for the two ETA10 machines at this center, they were destroyed with sledgehammers to prevent illicit use)
* Purdue University (contributed to ETA System V, the System V UNIX variant that ran on the ETA10).
* Tokyo Institute of Technology Took delivery of an 8-CPU liquid-cooled system in 1988
* Meiji University Took delivery of an ETA10-P system in 1989
* Academia Sinica

<text>Proposed bills are often categorized into public bills and private bills. A public bill is a proposed law which would apply to everyone within its jurisdiction. A private bill is a proposal for a law affecting only a single person, group, or area, such as a bill granting a named person citizenship or, previously, granting named persons a legislative divorce.

Private law can afford relief from another law, grant a unique benefit or powers not available under the general law, or relieve someone from legal responsibility for some allegedly wrongful act. There are many examples of such private law in democratic countries, although its use has changed over time. A private bill is not to be confused with a private member&#x27;s bill, which is a bill introduced by a &quot;private member&quot; of the legislature rather than by the ministry.

In modern practice, private bills are mixed and have both private and public aspects. In such cases the proposed legislation is called a hybrid bill. Some public laws set out such narrow terms of applicability that they apply to only one person or organization, making them &quot;de facto&quot; private laws. This may be used (successfully or unsuccessfully) to get around prohibitions on certain kinds of public laws.

==United Kingdom==

Public bills are the most common bills introduced in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. If they are enacted, they become public general acts (in contrast with local and personal acts).

Private bills create two types of act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. The first are acts for the benefit of individuals (known as private or personal acts) which have historically often dealt with divorces or granting British nationality to foreigners, but in modern times are generally limited to authorising marriages which would otherwise not be legal. The most recent such act was made in 1987.

The second type are public acts for the benefit of organisations, or authorising major projects such as railways or canals, or granting extra powers to local authorities (known as local acts). Private bills were used in the nineteenth century to create corporations and grant monopolies. They are still used in relation to large infrastructure projects, such as HS2, where law is being created primarily to give effect to rights and powers being exercised by a private (even if largely state owned) entity.

There is another classification known as a hybrid instrument which shares characteristics of both public and private bills. Hybrid bills become public acts.

==Canada==
Divorce in Canada prior to the passage of the Divorce Act of 1968 was sometimes handled by private laws. If unavailable by administrative or judicial means, it was possible to obtain a legislative divorce by application to the Senate of Canada, which reviewed and investigated petitions for divorce, which would then be voted upon by the Senate and subsequently made into law.

==United States==

Public bills are the most common type of law in the United States.

The Constitution of the United States prohibits bills of attainder in both state and federal legislatures, meaning private laws cannot be used to punish any specific individual or organization. This does not prohibit private laws which are favorable to a person or corporation.

In the United States, private bills were previously common. However, federal agencies are now able to deal with most of the issues that were previously dealt with under private bills as these agencies have been granted sufficient discretion by the United States Congress to deal with exceptions to the general legislative scheme of various laws. The kinds of private bills that are still introduced include grants of citizenship to individuals who are otherwise ineligible for normal visa processing; alleviation of tax liabilities; armed services decorations; and veteran benefits.

<text>The Music of Pennsylvania dates from the pre-colonial-era through the 21st century. During this time, Pennsylvania has been the birthplace for some of the most prominent musicians of their respective eras and the introduction of entire new genres of music to the nation and world.

The Philly sound of the 1970s is soul music that includes notable Pennsylvania performers Gamble and Huff, The O&#x27;Jays, The Stylistics, Teddy Pendergrass, Harold Melvin, and The Delfonics, jazz legends like Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, and John Coltrane. Philadelphia gave to the musical world diverse singers, such as Marian Anderson, Mario Lanza, Solomon Burke, Chubby Checker, Dee Dee Sharp, and the trio performing as The Golden Boys, Frankie Avalon, Bobby Rydell, and Fabian Forte, who grew up together in the same Philly neighborhood. Philadelphia was also the birthplace of &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and the home of Cameo-Parkway Records and the famed Philadelphia Orchestra.

The tradition of Pennsylvania&#x27;s history with music pre-dates the American Revolution. Philadelphia became especially renowned for musical development and was the home of the esteemed Alexander Reinagle, John Christopher Moller, Rayner Taylor, and Susannah Haswell Rowson. Reinagle became the most influential figure in Philadelphia&#x27;s musical life, organizing a number of concerts, organizations and musical events. Francis Hopkinson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was a notable composer of the period. One of his compositions, &quot;My Days Have Been So Wondrous Free&quot;, is well-remembered as the first art song from the United States (though this is disputed); it is, however, lacking in originality and innovation to set it apart from European compositions.

During the 19th century, Stephen Foster, one of the most popular American songwriter of the century, was born in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh 

Several concert bands formed in the 19th century during the rise in popularity of community bands, including the Allentown Band, based in Allentown, and The Emigsville Band, based in Emigsville.

Pennsylvania musicians and groups include:

==Indigenous music==

==History==
===Religious music in the colonial era===

During the colonial era, the Province of Pennsylvania was home to the Quakers, Moravians, and Lutherans. While the Quakers had few musical traditions, Protestant churches made extensive use of music in worship. J. F. Peter emerged from the Moravian tradition. Conrad Beissel, founder of the Ephrata Cloister, innovated his own system of harmonic theory. Lutherans Johann Sebastian Bach, Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel, and C. F. W. Walther were propagated all over colonial-era Pennsylvania, and especially in present-day Bethlehem, which was the first Lutheran settlement in colonial America and remains a center of Lutheran musical traditions into the 21st century.

====Ephrata Cloister====

The Ephrata Cloister (&quot;Community of the Solitary&quot;) was founded in what is now Lancaster County on the Cocalico River in 1720. This was a group of Seventh Day Baptists led by Peter Miller and Conrad Beissel, who believed in using music as an integral part of worship. Beissel codified the Ephrata Cloister&#x27;s unique tradition in his &quot;Beissel&#x27;s Dissertation on Harmony&quot;; here, he divided notes into two types. These were &quot;masters&quot;, or notes belonging to the common chord, and &quot;servants&quot;, or all other notes. Accented syllables in Beissel&#x27;s works always fell on master notes, leaving servant notes for unaccented syllables. The Ephrata Cloister&#x27;s hymnbook was large, consisting of more than 1,000 hymns, many of which were accompanied by instruments including the violin. Many of these hymns were published in the 1740s and 1750s.

===Harmony Society===

In 1803 and 1804, a group of Christian pietists led by George Rapp arrived from Württemberg, Germany, settled in Harmony, Pennsylvania, and formed the Harmony Society in 1805. The group lived communally, were pacifistic, advocated celibacy, and music was a big part of their lives. The Harmonites (or Harmonists) wrote their own music and even had an orchestra. The Society lasted until 1906, but their final settlement, Old Economy Village in present-day Ambridge, Pennsylvania contains archives with sheet music that is still performed at special community events.

====Lutherans====

Justus Falckner was the first Lutheran pastor ordained in the United States. He was ordained during 1703 as a minister of the Church of Sweden in the Gloria Dei Church. He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on November 24. Falckner wrote hymns such as &quot;Rise, Ye Children of Salvation&quot; (German: &quot;Auf! ihr Christen, Christi Glieder&quot;) which he composed while a student at the University of Halle in 1697. Falckner&#x27;s published works include &quot;Grondlycke Onderricht&quot; which first appeared in New York during 1708. Falckner evidently believed that music was a very important element of missionary work, writing to Germany to ask for an organ, which he said would attract more Native American converts.

====Mennonites====

The Mennonites, followers of Menno Simons, settled in Germantown after emigrating from the German Palatinate and Switzerland between 1683 and 1748. They were led by Willem Rittinghuysen, grandfather of astronomer and mathematician David Rittenhouse. The Mennonites used a hymnbook from Schaffhausen, reprinted in the present-day Germantown section of Philadelphia in 1742 as &quot;Der Ausbund Das ist etliche schöne christliche Lieder&quot;.

====Moravian Church====

Founded in 1457, the Moravian Church originally spread across Moravia, Poland, and Bohemia before persecution forced the remaining faithful to Saxony, where they lived under the protection of Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Zinzendorf wrote hymns, and led the Moravians to America, where they began missionary work in Georgia but with little success. They moved on to Pennsylvania, and founded the town of Bethlehem on the banks of the Lehigh River. A group then left for Salem, North Carolina in present-day Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Both in Salem and Bethlehem, Moravians continued to use music in their ceremonies. Instruments included organs and trombones, and voices were usually in choirs. Players generally played on rooftops for most any occasion, ensuring that they could be heard for great distances. A legend has arisen claiming that a group of Native American warriors approached a Moravian settlement during the French and Indian War, but left after hearing a trombone choir because they believed it to be the voice of their Great Spirit. Moravians were devoted to missionary work, especially among African slaves and Native Americans; in 1763, they published a collection of hymns in the Delaware language.

Moravians also had a tradition of secular art music that included the famed composer Johann Friedrich Peter, who was a German born in Holland who emigrated to Bethlehem in 1770. He brought with him copies of compositions by Joseph Haydn, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, Johann Stamitz and C. F. Abel. After living in Bethlehem for a time, Peter moved to Salem, where he founded the Collegium Musicum (in 1786) and collected hundreds of symphonies, anthems and oratorios. It was during this period that Peter also composed a number of well-respected instrumental pieces for two violins, two violas and a cello; he also composed sacred anthems like &quot;It Is a Precious Thing&quot; and arias like &quot;The Lord Is in His Holy Temple&quot;.

The Moravian Church continued to produce a number of renowned composers into the 19th century, including John Antes, Johann Christian Bechler, David Moritz Michael, Jeremiah Dencke, Johannes Herbst, and others. Herbst was also a noted collector, whose archives, left to the Salem church after his death, were made public in 1977; these included more than 11,000 pages of content. Salem has gradually become the center for Moravian musical innovation, partially due to the presence of the Moravian Music Foundation.

====Pietists====

In 1694, Johannes Kelpius brought a group of German Pietists to the banks of the Wissahickon Creek. These became known as the Hermits or Mystics of the Wissahickon; an 1871 map of Wissahickon Creek notes a Kelpius spring and Hermits Glen. Kelpius was a musician, and he and his followers brought with them instruments that became an integral part of church life. Kelpius was also a composer, and is sometimes called the first Pennsylvanian composer, based on his unproven authorship of several hymns in &quot;The Lamenting Voice of the Hidden Love&quot;. It is likely that he wrote the text, though the tunes are mostly based on German songs; the English translations in the collection are attributed to Christopher Witt, an Englishman who immigrated and joined the mystics, also building them a pipe organ, said to be the first privately owned organ in North America.

<doc id="308034" wikidata="Q4997589" url="?curid=308034" title="Bung Enterprises">
<text>Bung Enterprises Ltd. was an electronics company based in Hong Kong. Its products were controversial backup and development units for videogame consoles, which could allow the user to play a game without owning the original cartridge. Backup units for Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, Neo-Geo, Neo Geo Pocket, Genesis, Game Boy and Nintendo 64 were developed and produced by Bung.

&quot;Bung&quot; is the approximate pronunciation of the company&#x27;s Chinese name (). Both written forms were used in product packaging and marketing literature, and the somewhat crude connotation of the English word appears to have been an unintended coincidence. Although in business for more than a decade, the company was relatively unknown in the West until the late 1990s. In 1997 it began selling the Doctor V64, the first commercially available copier for the Nintendo 64, which quickly gained popularity in the
United States and Europe. The following year, it released the V64 Jr, a lower cost model without a CD-ROM drive. The company also began selling rewritable flash memory cards for the Game Boy, and a programming interface called the GB Xchanger.

During this time period, Nintendo became increasingly aggressive at trying to stop Bung and the sale of its products. Nintendo first filed lawsuits in the United States against retailers Carl Industries and Upstate Games, accusing them of contributory copyright infringement for selling Bung products. This was initially a somewhat difficult case for Nintendo, as under the
Betamax precedent, copying devices were legal in the United States if they
had non-infringing uses. It turned out that due to a severe shortage of official development hardware from Nintendo, many game developers had been buying from Bung instead. When Bung became aware of this, they began promoting their products for this purpose, and even sponsored a coding competition for amateur game developers. The US lawsuits were eventually settled, with the retailers agreeing to stop selling the copying devices.

Nintendo tried a different tactic to stop sales in Europe by reporting Bung products as not being CE mark certified. This resulted in Bung having their power adapters certified, and sales continued. Nintendo next filed a lawsuit against Bung in Hong Kong. The owners of Bung Enterprises responded by dissolving the corporation in March 2000. A few months later they formed a new company under the name First Union Technology, and began selling the same products with different labeling, using the brand name Mr. Flash. The V64 Jr. was sold as the E64, and the GB Xchanger became the Flash Linker.

After Nintendo succeeded in having shipments of the new &quot;Mr. Flash&quot; products confiscated by US Customs, the company stopped selling directly to US residents, but sales through third parties continued. Nintendo next focused on Hong Kong retailer Lik Sang, which Microsoft and Sony were also targeting due to sales of modchips. This led to a slightly embarrassing incident in February 2002 in which US Customs intercepted a rather innocuous package containing a serial cable. Package seizures apparently ceased after this incident. In October 2002, Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft jointly filed suit against Lik-Sang, resulting in the company shutting down for two weeks, and then reopening sans the disputed products.

==Products==

===Game Doctor/Professor SF===
Known in Hong Kong as &quot;超任博士&quot; (literally means &quot;Super Nintendo Doctor&quot;), this unit was designed for the backing up of Super Famicom/Super NES games.

===GB Xchanger===
This unit was designed for the backing up of Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. It was also used to write said backups onto a flash cartridge for use on the consoles in question. The unit was designed with a Game Boy-specific slot on the top of the unit and took 6 AAA batteries or a 9V adapter for power, and it connected to a PC via a parallel port.

===Neo Flash Linker===
This unit was designed for the backing up of Neo-Geo Pocket and Neo-Geo Pocket Color games. The physical construction was identical to that of the GB Xchanger unit, save for the Neo-Geo Pocket slot on top, as opposed to the Game Boy slot. NGP flash carts were also available.

<doc id="308036" wikidata="Q659803" url="?curid=308036" title="Ashton-under-Lyne">
<text>Ashton-under-Lyne is a market town in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England. The population was 48,604 at the 2021 census. Historically in Lancashire, it is on the north bank of the River Tame, in the foothills of the Pennines, east of Manchester.

Evidence of Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Viking activity has been discovered in Ashton-under-Lyne. The &quot;Ashton&quot; part of the town&#x27;s name probably dates from the Anglo-Saxon period, and derives from Old English meaning &quot;settlement by ash trees&quot;. The origin of the &quot;under-Lyne&quot; suffix is less clear; it possibly derives from the Brittonic-originating word &quot;lemo&quot; meaning elm or from Ashton&#x27;s proximity to the Pennines. In the Middle Ages, Ashton-under-Lyne was a parish and township and Ashton Old Hall was held by the de Asshetons, lords of the manor. Granted a royal charter in 1414, the manor spanned a rural area consisting of marshland, moorland, and a number of villages and hamlets.

Until the introduction of the cotton trade in 1769, Ashton was considered &quot;bare, wet, and almost worthless&quot;. The factory system, and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution triggered a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Ashton had emerged as an important mill town at a convergence of newly constructed canals and railways. Ashton-under-Lyne&#x27;s transport network allowed for an economic boom in cotton spinning, weaving, and coal mining, which led to the granting of municipal borough status in 1847.

In the mid-20th century, imports of cheaper foreign goods led to the decline of Ashton&#x27;s heavy industries but the town has continued to thrive as a centre of commerce and Ashton Market is one of the largest outdoor markets in the United Kingdom. Ashton Town Centre is now home to the , two-floored Ashton Arcades shopping centre (opened 1995), the outdoor shopping complex Ladysmith Shopping Centre, and a large IKEA store.

In 2018, a large new development opened in Ashton town centre including a new college campus for Tameside College, new council offices and a library. Improvements were also made to the open-air market, including new kiosks and stalls. In 2019, work began on a brand-new transport interchange for the town centre to make getting into the town much easier via bus and Metrolink. This opened in August 2020.

==History==
Evidence of prehistoric activity in the area comes from Ashton Moss – a peat bog – and is the only one of Tameside&#x27;s 22 Mesolithic sites not located in the hilly uplands in the north east of the borough. A single Mesolithic flint tool has been discovered in the bog, along with a collection of nine Neolithic flints. There was further activity in or around the bog in the Bronze Age. In about 1911, an adult male skull was found in the moss; it was thought to belong to the Romano-British period – similar to the Lindow Man bog body – until radiocarbon dating revealed that it dated from 1,320 to 970 BC.

The eastern terminus of the early medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch is in Ashton Moss (); it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th century. Legend claims it was built in a single night in 869 or 870 as a defence against Viking invaders. Further evidence of Dark Age activity in the area comes from the town&#x27;s name. The &quot;Ashton&quot; part probably derives from the Anglo-Saxon meaning &quot;settlement by ash trees&quot;; the origin of the &quot;under-Lyne&quot; element is less clear: it could derive from the British &quot;lemo&quot; meaning elm, or refer to Ashton being &quot;under the line&quot; of the Pennines. This means that Ashton probably became a settlement some time after the Romans left Britain in the 5th century. An early form of the town&#x27;s name, which included a &quot;burh&quot; element, indicates that in the 11th century Ashton and Bury were two of the most important towns in Lancashire. The &quot;under Lyne&quot; suffix was not widely used until the mid-19th century when it became useful for distinguishing the town from other places called Ashton.
The &quot;Domesday Survey&quot; of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael&#x27;s Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresles, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was &quot;one of the finest great houses in the North West&quot; of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a royal charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.

According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.

The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when their male line ended. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great-grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758. The Booth-Greys then held the manor until the 19th century; their patronage, despite being absentee lords, was probably the stimulus for Ashton&#x27;s growth of a large-scale domestic-based textile industry in the 17th century. Pre-industrial Ashton was centred on four roads: Town Street, Crickets Lane, Old Street, and Cowhill Lane. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the town was re-planned, with a grid pattern of roads. As a result, very little remains of the previous town. In 1730 a workhouse was established which consisted of a house and two cottages; it later came to be used as a hospital. The Ashton Canal was constructed in the 1790s to transport coal from the area to Manchester, with a branch to the coal pits at Fairbottom.

Domestic fustian and woollen weaving have a long history in the town, dating back to at least the Early Modern period. Accounts dated 1626 highlight that Humphrey Chetham had dealings with clothworkers in Ashton. However, the introduction of the factory system in the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution, changed Ashton from a market town to a mill town. Having previously been one of the two main towns in the Tame Valley, Ashton-under-Lyne became one of the &quot;most famous mill towns in the North West&quot;. On Christmas Day 1826, workers in the town formed the Ashton Unity, a sickness and benefits society that was later renamed the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds. From 1773 to 1905, 75 cotton mills were established in the town. On his tour of northern England in 1849, Scottish publisher Angus Reach said: 

The cotton industry in the area grew rapidly from the start of the 19th century until the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865. The growth of the town&#x27;s textile industry led to the construction of estates specifically for workers. Workers&#x27; housing in Park Bridge, on the border between Ashton and Oldham, was created in the 1820s. The iron works were founded in 1786 and were some of the earliest in the north west. The Oxford Mills settlement was founded in 1845 by the local industrialist and mill-owner Hugh Mason who saw it as a model industrial community. The community was provided with a recreational ground, a gymnasium, and an institute containing public baths, a library, and a reading room. Mason estimated that establishing the settlement cost him around £10,000 and would require a further £1,000 a year to maintain (about £600,000 and £60,000 respectively as of 2025), and that its annual mortality rate was significantly lower than in the rest of the town.

A poor supply of fresh water and dwellings without adequate drainage led to a cholera outbreak in the town in 1832. The Ashton Poor Law Union was established in 1837 and covered most of what is now Tameside. A new workhouse was built in 1850 which provided housing for 500 people. It later became part of Tameside General Hospital. Construction on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA&amp;MR) began in 1837 to provide passenger transport between Manchester and Sheffield. Although a nine-arch viaduct in Ashton collapsed in April 1845, the line was fully opened on 22 December 1845. The SA&amp;MR was amalgamated with the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, the Great Grimsby &amp; Sheffield Railway, and the Grimsby Docks Company in 1847 to form the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR). In 1890, the MS&amp;LR bought the Old Hall and demolished it to make way for the construction of new sidings.
In the late 19th century, public buildings such as the market hall, town hall, public library, and public baths were built. A donation from Hugh Mason funded the construction of the baths built in 1870–1871. The Ashton-under-Lyne Improvement Act was passed in 1886 which gave the borough influence over housing and allowed the imposition of minimum standards such as drainage. Coal mining was not as important to the town as the textile industry, but in 1882 the Ashton Moss Colliery had the deepest mine shaft in the world at . Ashton&#x27;s textile industry remained constant between 1865 and the 1920s. Although some mills closed or merged, the number of spindles in use increased. With the collapse of the overseas market in the 1920s, the town&#x27;s cotton industry went into decline, and by the 1930s most of the firms and mills in the area had closed.

At about 4.20 pm on Wednesday 13 June 1917, a fire in an ammunition factory producing TNT caused an explosion that demolished much of the west end of the town. Two gasometers exploded and the explosion destroyed the factory and threw heavy objects long distances. At least 41 people died and about 100 were injured. Sylvain Dreyfus, managing director of the works, helped to fight the fire but died in the subsequent explosion.

The second of the five victims of the Moors murders, 12-year-old John Kilbride, lived in the town. He was lured away from the town&#x27;s market on 23 November 1963 by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley before being murdered and buried on Saddleworth Moor. His body was found in October 1965.

Ashton became a part of the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in 1974. In May 2004, a huge fire ravaged the Victorian market hall, and a temporary building called &quot;The Phoenix Market Hall&quot; was built on Old Cross Street on the opposite side of the Old Market hall. Described as the &quot;heart of Ashton&quot;, the market was rebuilt and officially opened on 1 December 2008.

==Governance==

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Ashton anciently constituted a &quot;single parish-township&quot;, but was divided into four divisions (sometimes each styled townships): Ashton Town, Audenshaw, Hartshead, and Knott Lanes. Ashton Town was granted a royal charter in 1414, giving it the right to hold a market. All four divisions lay within the Hundred of Salford, an ancient division of the county of Lancashire.

In 1827, police commissioners were established for Ashton Town, tasked with bringing about social and economic improvement. In 1847, this area was incorporated under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, as a municipal borough with the name &quot;Ashton-under-Lyne&quot;, giving it borough status. When the administrative county of Lancashire was created by the Local Government Act 1888, the borough fell under the newly created Lancashire County Council. The borough&#x27;s boundaries changed during the late 19th century through small exchanges of land with the neighbouring districts of Oldham, Mossley, Dukinfield, and Stalybridge. In the early 20th century, the Borough of Ashton-under-Lyne grew; Hurst Urban District was added in 1927, parts of Hartshead and Alt civil parishes in 1935, and parts of Limehurst Rural District in 1954. Since 1956, Ashton has been twinned with Chaumont, France.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town&#x27;s borough status was abolished, and Ashton has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Ashton-under-Lyne is divided into four wards: Ashton Hurst, Ashton St. Michaels, Ashton St Peters, and Ashton Waterloo. After the 2012 local elections, all twelve seats were held by Labour councillors.

Since the Reform Act 1832 the town has been represented in Parliament as part of the Ashton-under-Lyne parliamentary constituency. During its early years the constituency was represented in the House of Commons by members of the Liberal Party until the late 19th century, when it was broadly held by the Conservative Party. It has been held by the Labour Party since 1935; Angela Rayner has been the constituency&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP) since 2015.

==Geography==


At (53.4941°, −2.1032°), and north-northwest of London, Ashton-under-Lyne stands on the north bank of the River Tame, about above the river. Described in Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; (1848) as situated &quot;on a gentle declivity&quot;, Ashton-under-Lyne lies on undulating ground by the Pennines, reaching a maximum elevation of about above sea level. It is east of Manchester city centre, and is bound on all sides by other towns: Audenshaw, Droylsden, Dukinfield, Mossley, Oldham, and Stalybridge, with little or no green space between them. Ashton experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles.

Generally the bedrock of the west of the town consists of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies to the west of the town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.

Ashton&#x27;s built environment is similar to the urban structure of most towns in England, consisting of residential dwellings centred on a market square and high street in the town centre, which is the local centre of commerce. There is a mixture of low-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Ashton-under-Lyne, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is residential; industrial areas and terraced houses give way to suburbs and rural greenery as the land rises out of the town in the east. The older streets are narrow and irregular, but those built more recently are spacious, lined by &quot;substantial and handsome houses&quot;. Areas and suburbs of Ashton-under-Lyne include Cockbrook, Crowhill, Guide Bridge, Hartshead, Hazelhurst, Hurst, Limehurst, Ryecroft, Taunton, and Waterloo.

==Demography==
As of the 2001 UK census, Ashton-under-Lyne had a population of 43,236. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 96.1 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 30.9% were single (never married) and 50.0% married. Ashton-under-Lyne&#x27;s 18,347 households included 33.2% single people, 33.0% married couples living together, 8.9% co-habiting couples, and 12.4% single parents with their children; these figures were similar to those of Tameside, however both Tameside and Ashton have higher rates of single-parent households than England (9.5%). Of those aged 16–74, 37.0% had no academic qualifications, similar to the figure of 35.2% for all of Tameside but significantly higher than the 28.9% figure for all of England, and 12% had an educational qualification such as first degree, higher degree, qualified teacher status, qualified medical doctor, qualified dentist, qualified nurse, midwife, health visitor, or similar, compared with 20% nationwide.

In 1931, 10% of Ashton&#x27;s population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased steadily to 17% compared with 24% nationally. In the same time frame, there was a decline in the working-class population. In 1931, 34% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 29% in Ashton and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers.

===Population change===
In 1700, the population of Ashton, the Tame Valley&#x27;s main urban area, was an estimated 550. The town&#x27;s 18th-century growth was fuelled by an influx of people from the countryside attracted by the prospect of work in its new industries, mirroring the rest of the region. In the early 19th century, Irish immigrants escaping from the Great Irish Famine were also drawn to the area by the new jobs created. The availability of jobs created by the growth of the textile industry in the town led to Ashton&#x27;s population increasing by more than 400% between 1801 and 1861, from 6,500 to 34,886. The population dropped by 9% during the 1860s as a consequence of the cotton famine caused by the American Civil War. The table below details the population change since 1851, including the percentage change since the previous census.

==Religion==

St Michael and All Angels&#x27; Church is a Grade I listed building that dates back to at least 1262, although it was rebuilt in the 15th, 16th, and 19th centuries. In 1795 it was the only church in the town, and one of only two in Tameside. There was a great increase in the number of chapels and religious buildings in the area during the 19th century, and by the end of the century there were 44 Anglican churches and 138 chapels belonging to other denominations. The most common denominations amongst the chapels were Catholic, Congregationalist, and Methodist.

The 19th-century evangelist John Wroe attempted to turn Ashton-under-Lyne into a &quot;new Jerusalem&quot;. He founded the Christian Israelite Church, and from 1822 to 1831 Ashton-under-Lyne was the religion&#x27;s headquarters. Wroe intended to build a wall around the town with four gateways, and although the wall was never constructed, the four gatehouses were. Popular opinion in the town turned against Wroe when he was accused of indecent behaviour in 1831, but the charges were dismissed. The Church spread to Australia, where it is still active.
As of the 2001 UK census, 68.5% of Ashton residents reported themselves as being Christian, 6.1% Muslim, 5.0% Hindu, and 0.2% Buddhist. The census recorded that 11.4% had no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion, and 8.7% did not state their religion. The proportion of Hindus in the town was much higher than the average for the borough and the whole of England (1.4% and 1.1% respectively). The percentage of Muslims in Ashton-under-Lyne was nearly double the national average of 3.1%, and was higher than the average of 2.5% for Tameside. As of October 2013, six mosques were located in the town, including one on Hillgate Street in Penny Meadow (Ashton Central Mosque, formerly known as Markazi Jamia Mosque) and one on Katherine Street in West End (Masjid Hamza Mosque).

==Economy==

In the medieval period, farming was important in Ashton, particularly arable farming. By the 18th century, textiles had also become important to the town&#x27;s economy; in the 1700s, 33% of those with jobs worked in textiles and 36% in agriculture. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the second half of the 18th century, the textile industry in the town boomed. It continued to expand until the cotton famine of 1861–1865, after which the industry remained steady until it collapsed after the overseas markets shut down in the 1920s.

Coal has been mined in Ashton since at least the 17th century. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries demand for coal increased, which led to an expansion of the town&#x27;s coal industry. The produce of the collieries was transported by canal to Manchester. The industry began to decline during the late 19th century, and by 1904 only the Ashton Moss Colliery was still operational, the last colliery to be opened in the area.

Ashton town centre, which is the largest in Tameside, developed in the Victorian period. Many of the original buildings have survived, and as a result, the town centre is protected by Tameside Council as a conservation area. As well as being populated by leading high-street names, Ashton has an outdoor market which was established in the medieval period. It is made up of about 180 stalls, and is open six days a week. The farmers&#x27; market, with over 70 stalls, is the largest in the region, as is the weekday flea market. Ashton Market Hall underwent a £15 million restoration after it was damaged by fire. The Ashton Renewal Area project has attracted investment in the town centre, encouraging conservation and economic development.

The , two-floored Ashton Arcades shopping centre opened in 1995; permission has been granted for a £40 million extension but work on this project has yet to begin. In 2006, after failing twice to gain permission, IKEA announced plans to build its first town-centre store in Ashton-under-Lyne. The store was expected to create 500 new jobs and to attract other businesses to the area. The store opened on 19 October 2006 and covers . At the time of its creation, the store was the tallest in Britain.

Amongst the facilities provided by Ashton Leisure Park are a 14-screen cinema, a bowling alley, and several restaurants. The St Petersfield area of Ashton underwent a £42 million redevelopment and provided 2,000 jobs. The aim of the investment was to create a business district in the town and bring life to a neglected area of Ashton. The development provided of office space and of retail and leisure space. Pennine Care NHS Trust relocated its headquarters to the St Petersfield area in 2006. Until then a popular nightspot, in 2002 several night clubs were brought to the brink of closure after a downturn in trade caused by four murders in three months.

According to the 2001 UK census, residents aged 16–74 were employed in the following industries: 22.7% manufacturing, 18.6% retail and wholesale, 11.3% health and social work, 9.8% property and business services, 6.7% construction, 6.5% transport and communications, 5.8% education, 5.6% public administration, 4.3% hotels and restaurants, 3.8% finance, 0.4% agriculture, 0.7% energy and water supply, and 3.9% other. Compared with national figures, the town had a relatively low percentage working in agriculture, public administration, and property, and high rates of employment in construction, at more than triple the national rate (6.8%). The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74; 2.0% were students with jobs, 3.8% students without jobs, 6.4% looking after home or family, 9.5% permanently sick or disabled, and 3.9% economically inactive for other reasons. Ashton&#x27;s 4.1% unemployment rate was above the national rate of 3.3%.

==Culture==

===Sport===
The town&#x27;s most prominent football teams are Ashton United F.C. and Curzon Ashton F.C. Ashton United was the first team in the Manchester Football Association to win an FA Cup tie, when they beat Turton 3–0 in 1883. In 1885, they were the first winners of the Manchester Senior Cup, beating Newton Heath (who later became Manchester United) in the final. They currently compete in playing at Hurst Cross. Curzon Ashton has competed since 2015 in the National League North, the highest level in the club&#x27;s history; they play at the Tameside Stadium. Other sporting venues include the Richmond Park Athletics Stadium, which has an all-weather running track with facilities for field events and is home to the East Cheshire Harriers, Tameside Athletics Club, and Ashton Cricket Club, which has won the Central Lancashire Cricket League&#x27;s first and second division twice each, and the Wood Cup four times. The Ashton Ladysmith Cricket Club is based at the Ladysmith Sport Center at Rose Hill Road and competes in the North Manchester Cricket League.

===Landmarks===

After the Ashton Canal closed in the 1960s, it was decided to turn the Portland Basin warehouse into a museum. In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of the building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside&#x27;s social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.

The earliest parts of Ashton Town Hall, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the Corinthian columns on the entrance facade. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. The Old Street drill hall was completed in 1887.
There are five parks in the town, three of which have Green Flag Awards. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, after a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for £15,000 (£ as of 2025) and further land was donated by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake and a memorial to Joseph Rayner Stephens, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions. A conservatory was opened in 1907 and Coronation gates were installed at both the Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge entrances in 1953.

Hartshead Pike is a stone tower on top of Hartshead Hill overlooking Ashton and Oldham. The existing building was constructed in 1863 but there has been a building on the site since at least the mid-18th century, although the original purpose is obscure. The pike might have been the site of a beacon in the late 16th century. It has a visitor centre and, from the top of the hill, it is possible to see the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, the Welsh hills and the Holme Moss transmitter in West Yorkshire.
The Witchwood public house, in the St Petersfield area of the town, has been a music venue since the 1960s, hosting acts such as Muse, The Coral and Lost Prophets. In 2004, The Witchwood came under threat when the area was being redeveloped, but was saved from demolition after a campaign by locals and led by Tom Hingley, drawing support from musicians such as Bert Jansch, The Fall and The Chameleons.

The main Ashton-under-Lyne War Memorial, in Memorial Gardens, consists of a central cenotaph on a plinth, surmounted by a sculpted wounded soldier and the figure of &quot;Peace who is taking the sword of honour&quot; from his hand. It commemorates the 1,512 people from the town who died in the First World War and the 301 who died in the Second World War. The cenotaph is flanked on both sides by bronze lions. The plinth is decorated with military equipment representing the services, as well as bronze tablets listing the Roll of Honour from World War I. Commissioned by the Ashton War Memorial Committee, the statue was sculpted between 1919 and 1922 by John Ashton Floyd, and was unveiled on 16 September 1922 by General Sir Ian Hamilton.

The tablet on the front of the memorial reads:

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester on 95.1 FM, Capital Manchester and Lancashire on 102.0 FM, Heart North West on 105.4 FM, Smooth North West on 100.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West on 96.2 FM, and Tameside Radio, a community based station which broadcast from the town on 103.6 FM.

The local newspaper is the &quot;Tameside Reporter&quot;, published on Thursdays.

==Transport==

===Roads===
In 1732, an Act of Parliament was passed which permitted the construction of a turnpike from Manchester, then in Lancashire, to Salters Brook in Cheshire. The road passed through Ashton-under-Lyne as well as Audenshaw, Mottram-in-Longdendale, and Stalybridge. A turnpike trust was responsible for collecting tolls from traffic; the proceeds were used for road maintenance. The trust for Manchester to Salters Brook was one of over 400 established between 1706 and 1750, a period in which turnpikes became popular. It was the first turnpike to be opened in Tameside, and driven by economic growth, more turnpikes were opened in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Acts of Parliaments were passed in 1765, 1793, and 1799 permitting the construction of turnpikes from Ashton-under-Lyne to Doctor Lane Head in Saddleworth, Standedge in Saddleworth, and Oldham respectively. Towards the end of the 19th century, many turnpike trusts were wound up as they were superseded by local government; the last in Tameside to close was the Ashton-under-Lyne to Salters Brook road in 1884. Ashton is now served by the M60 motorway, which cuts through the west end of Ashton (Junction 23).

===Canals===

The town of Ashton-under-Lyne became the focus of three canals which were constructed in Tameside in the 1790s because it was an important centre of coal mining in the Lancashire coalfield. The 1790s has been characterised as a period of mania for canal building in England. The first of the three to be built was the Ashton Canal, which was constructed between 1792 and 1797. Connecting Manchester to Ashton-under-Lyne, with a branch to Oldham, it cost about £170,000 (£ as of 2025). The Peak Forest Canal was constructed from 1794 to 1805, and was originally planned as a branch of the Ashton Canal. It connected the Portland Basin with the Peak District and cost £177,000 (£ as of 2025). The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was built between 1794 and 1811, to enable cross-Pennine trade between Manchester and Kingston upon Hull; the cost of construction was £400,000.

The advent of the railways in the 19th century signalled the decline of the canal system. The new railways were quicker and more economical than the canals, and the waterways declined. The Huddersfield Canal was bought by the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway in 1844. Along with the Ashton and Peak Forest canals, the Huddersfield Canal was later bought by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company. The canals remained in use throughout the 19th century on a smaller scale than in their heyday, but by the mid-20th century all commercial traffic had ceased. Following an extended period of closure and dereliction, during which parts of the Huddersfield Canal were filled in or built over, a complete restoration was undertaken and the entire canal reopened in 2001. The three canals are now used for leisure craft and are still maintained and in good condition.

===Railways===
The present station at Ashton was opened by the Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway (AS&amp;LJR) on 13 April 1846. Known originally as &quot;Ashton&quot;, it was renamed &quot;Ashton (Charlestown)&quot; in 1874 and then &quot;Ashton-under-Lyne&quot; on 6 May 1968. It has regular services on the Huddersfield Line between Manchester (Victoria) and Huddersfield.

The town historically had three stations, only one of which remains: Ashton (Charlestown), Park Parade (closed 1956) and Oldham Road (closed 1959). Park Parade station was on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway, which was founded in 1836 with the purpose of building a line linking Manchester and Sheffield. The line was opened in stages and was completed by 1845. It included a branch to the nearby town of Stalybridge, the former Ashton Park Parade station was included on this branch. Oldham Road station was on the Oldham, Ashton and Guide Bridge Railway. Additionally, Guide Bridge station, a few miles away, was known as &quot;Ashton &amp; Hooley Hill&quot; and then &quot;Ashton&quot; in its earliest years.

===Trams and buses===
In 1881, a tramway with horse-drawn tramcars was opened between Stalybridge and Audenshaw, through Ashton-under-Lyne. The first tramway of its kind in Tameside, it was later extended to Manchester. The Oldham, Ashton and Hyde Electric Tramway Company, founded in 1899, operated of tram lines with electric tramcars. It was the first line around Manchester to use electricity. A line from Stalybridge to Ashton-under-Lyne was opened in 1903 and operated by the Stalybridge, Hyde, Mossley &amp; Dukinfield Tramways &amp; Electricity Board. The first bus service from Ashton-under-Lyne ran in 1923 and the 1920s saw a period of decline for the tramways as they suffered from the competition with buses. The last of the first generation of electric tram services in the town ran in 1938.

After a 75-year absence, trams returned to Ashton in October 2013, when the Manchester Metrolink tram system opened the East Manchester Line to the town: Ashton-under-Lyne tram stop in the town centre stands alongside the bus station and is the terminus for the East Manchester Line, which runs to Manchester Piccadilly station and Manchester city centre. Away from the town centre towards Manchester, there are also the Ashton West and Ashton Moss tram stops.

==Education==

There are ten nursery schools, sixteen primary schools, and two secondary schools in Ashton-under-Lyne as of 2019. In 2006, the council began a scheme to develop education in the borough by opening six new secondary schools. Among the changes proposed as part of the £160 million scheme was the closure of Hartshead Sports College and Stamford Community High School, to be replaced by a 1,350-pupil academy with 300 sixth-form members. In 2007, Hartshead Sports College was placed on &quot;special measures&quot; after it failed to achieve its targets for General Certificate of Secondary Education results and was criticised by Ofsted for its teaching standard. The new academy opened in September 2008, a year ahead of schedule. It was named New Charter Academy (now Great Academy Ashton) after its sponsor, the New Charter Housing Trust.

The other secondary school in the town is St Damian&#x27;s RC Science College, which was founded in 1963, and provides education for 800 pupils aged 11–16. As part of the Building Schools for the Future project, a replacement school building was built by Carillion and opened in May 2011. Dale Grove School has 60 pupils and offers education for pupils aged 5–16 with special needs. Ashton Sixth Form College is a centre for further education with 1,650 pupils aged 16–18. Tameside College also provides opportunities for further education and operates in Ashton-under-Lyne, Droylsden, and Hyde. Founded in 1954 and expanded in 1957 and 1964, it was originally called Ashton College.

==Public services==
In the early 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne&#x27;s growth made it necessary to find a new water supply. Before the introduction of piped water the town&#x27;s inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame. Industrial processes had, however, polluted the river and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply. Waste management is now co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.
The first power station in Tameside was built in 1899, providing power for the area. Ashton&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is United Utilities; there are no power stations in the town. United Utilities also manages the drinking and waste water.

Home Office policing in Ashton-under-Lyne is provided by the Greater Manchester Police. The force&#x27;s Tameside Division have their divisional headquarters for policing Tameside in the town. Public transport in the area is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, which has one station on Slate Lane. The Tameside General Hospital is a large NHS hospital on the outskirts of the town, administered by Tameside &amp; Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust. The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport.

<doc id="308038" wikidata="Q6942173" url="?curid=308038" title="Music of Maryland">
<text>Maryland is a U.S. state with a musical heritage that dates back to the Native Americans of the region and includes contributions to colonial era music, modern American popular and folk music. The music of Maryland includes a number of popular musicians, folk styles and a documented music history that dates to the colonial archives on music from Annapolis, an important source in research on colonial music. Famous modern musicians from Maryland range from jazz singer Billie Holiday to pop punk band Good Charlotte, and include a wide array of popular styles.

Modern Maryland is home to many well-regarded music venues, including the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and Baltimore Opera, and the Peabody Institute&#x27;s Conservatory of Music. Baltimore, the largest city in the state, is home to many important local venues, such as the Red Room, a center for the local experimental music scene, and the house nightspot Club Choices. Outside of Baltimore, Frederick&#x27;s Weinberg Center for the Arts and Rockville&#x27;s Strathmore are also important regional venues. The Merriweather Post Pavilion and 1st Mariner Arena host most of the largest concerts in the area. Since HFStival ended its successful run in 2006, Virgin Festival has taken over as one of the most popular summer festivals on the east coast since its inaugural year in 2006.

== Institutions ==
Most of the major musical organizations in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at the Peabody Institute&#x27;s Conservatory of Music. These include Baltimore Choral Arts and the Baltimore Opera, as well as the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO). The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra formed in 1916 and was the only orchestra in the country to operate as a branch of the city&#x27;s government. In 1942, the orchestra was reorganized as a private institution. The Orchestra claims that Joseph Meyerhoff, President of the Orchestra beginning in 1965, and his music director, Sergiu Comissiona, began the modern history of the BSO and &quot;ensured the creation of an institution, which has become the undisputed leader of the arts community throughout the State of Maryland&quot;.

Aside from the prominent Baltimore Symphony, Maryland is also home to several other institutions. The Annapolis Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1962, is a well-known organization that has hosted guests like Cuban violinist Guillermo Perich and Charlie Byrd; the Annapolis Orchestra inspired composer David Ott to create the &quot;Annapolis Overture&quot;, which debuted in 1995. The Rohrersville Cornet Band, part of Maryland&#x27;s cornet band heritage, claims to be the oldest continually performing community band in the state, having been founded in 1837; it now performs in a dedicated music hall in Rohrersville. The Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras (MCYO) was formed in the 1946 to &quot;nurture, develop and advance young talented musicians in a quality orchestral program&quot;. Beginning in 1964, the Orchestras began to offer new programs, such as a summer camp that eventually became the Maryland Center for the Arts.

== Venues and festivals ==
The largest music venue in Maryland is the Merriweather Post Pavilion, opened in 1967 and designed by architect Frank Gehry to avoid disturbing as much as possible the surrounding Symphony Woods; it is an outdoor performance area, home to most of the largest concerts that come through the area. In the 1990s and early 2000s, HFStival, held by the WHFS radio station, established itself as an extremely popular annual festival, and became a major draw across the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Since 2006, Virgin Festival has established itself as a hugely popular festival annually held at Pimlico Race Course, drawing in a variety of popular acts. The Takoma Park Folk Festival is also well known among folk music aficionados, and has been held annually since 1978 in Takoma Park, Maryland.

Baltimore is home to several important concert spaces, including the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Concordia Hall and the Lyric Opera House. The Meyerhoff is home to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Concordia Hall is a long-standing venue, founded in 1867 by German musical societies, which were then a large portion of Baltimore&#x27;s population. The Lyric Opera House, founded in 1894, is another important Baltimore music venue; it has hosted many of the most famous performers and public speakers to come to Baltimore. Smaller Hardcore and Punk acts play at the Charm City Art Space.

The city of Frederick is home to the Weinberg Centre for the Arts, which shows various kinds of theatrical and musical productions. The Weinberg was originally a large movie theater called the Tivoli, opened in 1926; the Tivoli was destroyed in a flood in 1976, and was reopened as the Weinberg Center two years later. North Bethesda&#x27;s Strathmore opened in 1976, and is now a home for numerous programs, including the largest of its music venues, the Music Center at Strathmore; the Strathmore has hosted well-known musicians and composers like the cellist Steven Honigberg, pianist Christopher Taylor, jazz singers Nnenna Freelon and Luciana Souza and composers Virgil Thomson and Gunther Schuller, as well as DC-area cult acts like the founder of Go-go, Chuck Brown, and the reunited punk band The Slickee Boys.

== History ==

Indigenous peoples created the first music in what became Maryland. The documented music history of Maryland begins during the colonial era, in the 18th century. The capital city of Annapolis was a major center for music during the colonial era; the city&#x27;s Tuesday Club left behind documentation of musical life in Annapolis, one of the most complete sources for musical knowledge about that era in the United States. The larger growing port city of Baltimore 20 miles farther north eventually replaced Annapolis as a center for music in Maryland, and eventually became home to most of the prominent music institutions in the state, especially the Peabody Institute, founded by George Peabody in 1857. Later still, Baltimore&#x27;s Pennsylvania Avenue, northwest of downtown, became a very well known home for African American music, especially jazz, while Maryland began producing popular musicians like The Orioles. In modern times, Maryland has been a home for styles including emo and hardcore punk.

=== Colonial era ===
A few instruments, such as drums and trumpets, are known to have existed in the early history of the Maryland colony, probably as a functional means &quot;of calling the populace to church or to market, or in serving as symbols for sea captains and those from the military&quot;; some folk dancing and ballad singing is also substantiated by the historical record. The early colonists had little tradition of any performance art, due to the small number of individuals, their low standard of living and great poverty and disease.

With the arrival of large numbers of slaves, however, some white plantation owners earned enough wealth to invest in music and dance. The upper class used instruments like the flute, violin and harpsichord and danced formal dances like the stately minuet or English country dance, while the lower classes preferred reels and jigs, accompanied by various kinds of guitars, drums, banjos, transverse flutes and recorders, as well as, more rarely, hammered dulcimers and harpsichords.

Local music groups during the colonial era did much to sponsor musical development. Annapolis, a major center for colonial music in British North America, was home to the Homony Club and the Tuesday Club, while the Freemasons held balls and concerts across Maryland. Unlike the northern United States, religious music did not prosper in Maryland until the end of the colonial period, and then only in the German communities in the bustling ethnic port city of Baltimore along with outlying rural farming towns of Carroll, Montgomery and Frederick counties. Tavern owners frequently sponsored dances and concerts during the colonial era. Beginning in 1752, theater became a major part of Maryland culture for colonists of all classes; performances included light dance and incidental music, ballad operas and the works of William Shakespeare. Aside from the cultural and state capital of Annapolis, the city of Baltimore, and county seat towns of Upper Marlboro in southern Maryland and Chestertown on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay, were major homes for Maryland theater, home to the debuts of the latest and most popular dances. With the French and Indian War (1754–1763), and then the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), soldiers brought back home to Maryland military band music, especially fife and drum ensembles.

=== Early independence and 19th century ===
Professional theater in Maryland died out during the American Revolution but was reestablished by 1780, now with Baltimore having replaced Annapolis as a cultural capital in the state. Maryland ratified the federal Constitution on April 28, 1788, and became the seventh state in the Union. The Holiday Street Theater in Baltimore opened in 1793 and was one of the first large theaters in the country, showcasing light theater, opera, and concerts. In 1822, Arthur Clifton from Baltimore debuted his opera &quot;The Enterprise&quot;, while religious music flourished after the 1821 opening of the first constructed Roman Catholic Cathedral in the country. The African Methodist Episcopal churches in Maryland were home to singing traditions using the shape-note method.

By the turn of the century, the middle classes of Maryland were holding regular dances featuring the cotillion, quadrille, schottische, polka and waltz. Eastern European dances were also popular, brought by immigrants from various countries. Many immigrants in Maryland moved to Baltimore, forming their own distinct neighborhoods with German liederkranz singing societies, and Irish St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parades and Jewish chants flourished among their respective communities. Maryland was home to several folk traditions, including the work songs of rail and canal diggers and the crab- and oystermen of the Chesapeake Bay, whose repertoire varied from hymns to risqué songs and Bahaman shanties.

By the middle of the 19th century, Baltimore was a major center of sheet music publishing, home to Joseph Carr, F. D. Benteen, John Cole and George Willig, as well as the piano-building businesses of William Knabe and Charles Stieff. This period also saw the rise of blackface minstrel shows, featuring the pseudo-African American songs of composers like Dan Emmett and Stephen Foster.

During the Civil War, Maryland was a border state, home to people who sympathized with both sides of the conflict. Federal troops occupied Baltimore, and some people who wrote music that favored the Confederacy were jailed; these pieces included &quot;The Confederacy March&quot;, &quot;Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s Way&quot; and &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot;, the last later becoming Maryland&#x27;s state song. The Civil War left several lasting effects on American music nationwide, most importantly the normalization of white and black cultural mixing, especially in music, caused by the mixing of soldiers in multiracial units; military brass bands became a popular part of the music scene during and after the war, one of the first being the Moxley Band from Frederick.

The middle of the 19th century saw a wave of immigration from Europe into the United States, including a large number of German musicians who settled in Baltimore; the presence of these musicians, as well as the general growth in urban population with the Industrial Revolution and the continued rise of the music publishing industry, helped make music training more affordable for more Americans.

Conservatories, institutes of music education, were introduced to the United States in the mid to late 19th century, beginning with Baltimore&#x27;s Peabody Institute&#x27;s Conservatory of Music, founded in 1857. The Peabody trained numerous musicians who went on to found most of Baltimore&#x27;s major musical organizations, including the Baltimore Opera, Baltimore Choral Arts and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Though founded in 1857, the Peabody Institute did not hold an orchestral concert until after the Civil War, when James Monroe Deems directed a concert; Deems was a musician and composer, known for &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;, one of the first American oratorios. He was succeeded by Lucien Southard, who failed to organize the institute (then known as the &quot;Academy of Music&quot;), blaming the lack of a &quot;proper musical atmosphere&quot; in Baltimore. It was not until Asger Hamerik&#x27;s reign that the Peabody Symphony Orchestra finally became successful, one of only five professional orchestras in the country at the time. Hamerik was an advocate of American music and regularly included the works of American composers, eschewing the more typical European programs.

The Peabody during Hamerik&#x27;s leadership produced such noted individuals as Otto Sutro, publisher, music store owner and host of a music society called the Wednesday Club, and with fellow Peabody alum Fritz Finke, founder of the Oratorio Society. In 1871, Ford&#x27;s Grand Opera House opened, followed three years later by the Academy of Music; this new &quot;Academy of Music&quot; shared the name with the Peabody Institute&#x27;s organization, but in the same year changed to the &quot;Conservatory of Music&quot;. The Academy&#x27;s conductor, Adam Itzel, Jr. was a very popular composer, known for the national hit light opera &quot;The Tar and the Tartar&quot;.

=== Early 20th century ===
There were a number of mostly informal musical societies in Maryland by the end of the 19th century, including the Saturday Night Club of H. L. Mencken and the Florestan Club, which hosted such musicians as Mischa Elman, Leopold Stokowski and Walter Damrosch. The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra was the first permanent orchestra in the city since 1895, when the Peabody Orchestra dissolved; it opened in 1916 with conductor Gustav Strube; this came three years after the formation of the short-lived Baltimore Opera Society, which was eventually replaced by the Baltimore Opera in 1927.

While the largely white middle- and upper-class Baltimoreans supported the orchestras and other societies, the city&#x27;s African Americans formed their own Coloured Symphony Orchestra in 1931, which was municipally supported just like the BSO; the first performance included Ellis Larkins and Anne Brown, the latter known for creating the role of Bess in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. At the time, Pennsylvania Avenue (often known simply as &quot;The Avenue&quot;) was the major scene for Baltimore&#x27;s black musicians, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others.

=== Early 21st century ===
Many new, independent performing arts organizations formed in the early 21st century, including the Baltimore Rock Opera Society, Symphony Number One, Lunar Ensemble, and SONAR New Music Ensemble. Many of these groups were founded by students and alumni of the Peabody Institute.

== Folk music ==
Maryland&#x27;s folk music heritage remains little studied. There have been no major musicological studies in Maryland, though some Anglo-American and African American folk songs have been documented. The Library of Congress&#x27; American Folklife Center has a library of recorded Maryland folk music, which includes a wide array of songs and styles, including Bahamanian spirituals, Mexican music, African American blues, Appalachian folk music, steelpan and gospel music, and Piscataway Native American music. Maryland&#x27;s folk heritage also includes the traditional music of the German communities of central and western Maryland. Cornet bands, such as the Rohrersville Cornet Band, are also a prominent part of Maryland&#x27;s folk heritage.

The oystermen and others who work on the Chesapeake Bay have their own distinct folk song styles which include hymns and work songs. Some locally popular performers have used these folk themes in their music, including Bob Zentz and Steve Keith, all of whom have appeared on records by the Annapolis Maritime Museum&#x27;s Chesapeake Music Institute. The Piedmont blues, a style of blues music, is most closely associated with the music of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina, but also exists in Maryland, which has produced modern performers like Warner Williams and Jay Summerour. Bill Jackson, born 1906, from Granite, Maryland was an obscure Piedmont blues guitarist and singer. He was discovered by Pete Welding and recorded his first and only record in 1962. The Piedmont blues arose from a mixture of black gospel music with white string ensembles, and is characterized by a style of guitar playing influenced by ragtime and country music.

== Popular music ==
Maryland has produced popular musicians from many fields, including doo wop and hardcore punk, as well as the gangsta rap of Tupac Shakur, the contemporary R&amp;B of Toni Braxton (who had two No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including &quot;Un-break My Heart&quot; in 1996), Sisqo (who had a No. 1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Incomplete&quot; in 2000), and Mario (who had a No. 1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; in 2005), and the pop of Cass Elliott. Though doo wop can be traced to many urban areas across the United States, especially New York City, Sonny Til&#x27;s 1946 band called The Vibranaires, later known as The Orioles, can be considered the first doo wop group. The genre-crossing Frank Zappa was also from Maryland, as was Tupac Shakur, who was born in Harlem, though he began his career in Baltimore, eventually becoming one of the most famous rappers in hip hop history. Rapper Logic has had two No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 including &quot;Everybody&quot; in 2017.

Maryland has also produced many renowned jazz musicians, such as Eubie Blake, Elmer Snowden and Billie Holiday. &quot;The Urbanite&quot; magazine describes Baltimore jazz as variously a wildly varying array of styles or a &quot;hard bop town, where R&amp;B, gospel and bebop meet&quot;; during the middle of the 20th century, Baltimore produced a vibrant local jazz tradition characterized by the use of the B3 organ. Many modern Baltimorean jazz musicians are renowned saxophonists, including Gary Thomas, Gary Bartz and the Afro-Caribbean influenced TK Blue. Internationally acclaimed jazz ensemble Fertile Ground are also based in Baltimore.

Talking Heads lead singer David Byrne lived in Baltimore. Jimmie&#x27;s Chicken Shack, Clutch, Good Charlotte, SR-71, All Time Low, and O.A.R. are other popular American rock bands with strong ties to Maryland.

Mama Cass Elliot of The Mamas &amp; the Papas was from Maryland, and began her singing career there. Another Maryland band similar to the Mamas and Papas, the Peppermint Rainbow, was discovered by Mama Cass and had a top forty hit with the song &quot;Will you be staying after Sunday&quot;. Maryland-based band The Ravyns are also notable for having their song &quot;Raised on the Radio&quot; appear on the soundtrack to &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. The Dundalk-based Chorus of the Chesapeake won international championships in 1961 and 1971.

Baltimore&#x27;s hardcore punk scene has been overshadowed by DC&#x27;s. Jule&#x27;s Loft, was described by author Steven Blush as the &quot;apex of the Baltimore (hardcore) scene&quot; in 1983 and 1984. The 1980s also saw the development of a local new wave scene led by the bands Ebeneezer &amp; the Bludgeons, Null Set, and Here Today (later Vigil (band)). Later in the decade, emo bands like Reptile House had some success and recorded with Ian MacKaye in DC. Some early Baltimore punk musicians moved onto other local bands by the end of the 1990s, resulting in local mainstays Lungfish and Fascist Fascist, who became regionally prominent. &quot;The Urbanite&quot; magazine has identified several major trends in local Baltimorean music, including the rise of psychedelic-folk singer-songwriters like Entrance and the house/hip hop dance fusion called Baltimore club, pioneered by DJs like Rod Lee. More recently, Baltimore&#x27;s indie rock scene has produced performers like Cass McCombs and Mary Prankster.

Maryland has had a thriving doom metal scene since the early 1990s, and is now considered to have its own &quot;Maryland doom&quot; sound. This scene was started in the late 1970s with The Obsessed, a band led by Scott &quot;Wino&quot; Weinrich. During this time, Northern Virginia&#x27;s Pentagram also had a heavy influence on the Maryland scene. After disbanding The Obsessed in the mid 80s and moving to California to sing with doom legends Saint Vitus, Wino reformed The Obsessed and signed to the German-based Hellhound Records. With The Obsessed on board, Hellhound began to sign other Maryland bands, such as Wretched, Iron Man, Unorthodox, Internal Void, and Revelation (who already had an album on Rise Above Records). After Hellhound&#x27;s demise in the late 90s, many Maryland doom bands were picked up by various other labels, including Southern Lord Records. After The Obsessed second break up, Wino formed Spirit Caravan and The Hidden Hand. Other current Maryland doom bands include Earthride.

1980s metal band Kix are from Hagerstown. Death metal band Dying Fetus are from Upper Marlboro. Speed-thrash metal band Offensive are from Essex in Baltimore County. Progressive metal band Periphery are from Bethesda.

Maryland has a thriving experimental music scene, based around Baltimore. The local scene is led by artists and groups such as Dan Deacon, Double Dagger and North Carolina imports Future Islands. Famed group Animal Collective had their beginnings in the suburbs surrounding Baltimore, and named their breakout 2009 album &quot;Merriweather Post Pavilion&quot; after the famed Pavilion in Columbia.

<text>Andre Alice Norton (born Alice Mary Norton, February 17, 1912 – March 17, 2005) was an American writer of science fiction and fantasy, who also wrote works of historical and contemporary fiction. She wrote primarily under the pen name Andre Norton, but also under Andrew North and Allen Weston. She was the first woman to be Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy, to be SFWA Grand Master, and to be inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.

==Biography and career==
===Biography===
Alice Mary Norton was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1912. Her parents were Adalbert Freely Norton, who owned a rug company, and Bertha Stemm Norton. Alice began writing at Collinwood High School in Cleveland, under the tutelage of Sylvia Cochrane. She was the editor of a literary page in the school&#x27;s paper, &quot;The Collinwood Spotlight&quot;, for which she wrote short stories. During this time, she wrote her first book, &quot;Ralestone Luck&quot;, which was eventually published as her second novel in 1938.

After graduating from high school in 1930, Norton planned to become a teacher, and began studying at Flora Stone Mather College of Western Reserve University. However, in 1932 she had to leave because of the Depression and began working for the Cleveland Library System, where she remained for 18 years, latterly in the children&#x27;s section of the Nottingham Branch Library in Cleveland. In a 1996 interview she recalled defending acquisition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien for the library. In 1934, she legally changed her name to Andre Alice Norton, a pen name she had adopted for her first book, published later that year, to increase her marketability, since boys were the main audience for fantasy.

During 1940–1941, she worked as a special librarian in the cataloging department of the Library of Congress. She was involved in a project related to alien citizenship which was abruptly terminated upon the American entry into World War II. In 1941 she bought a bookstore called Mystery House in Mount Rainier, Maryland, the eastern neighbor of Washington, D.C. The business failed, and she returned to the Cleveland Public Library until 1950, when she retired due to ill health. She then began working as a reader for publisher-editor Martin Greenberg at Gnome Press, a small press in New York City that focused on science fiction. She remained until 1958, when, with 21 novels published, she became a full-time professional writer.

As Norton&#x27;s health became uncertain, she moved to Winter Park, Florida in November 1966, where she remained until 1997. She moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee in 1997 and was under hospice care from February 21, 2005. She died at home on March 17, 2005, of congestive heart failure.

===Literary career===
In 1934, her first book, &quot;The Prince Commands, being sundry adventures of Michael Karl, sometime crown prince &amp; pretender to the throne of Morvania&quot;, with illustrations by Kate Seredy, was published by D. Appleton–Century Company (cataloged by the U.S. Library of Congress as by &quot;André Norton&quot;). She went on to write several historical novels for the juvenile (now called &quot;young adult&quot;) market.

Norton&#x27;s first published science fiction was a short story, &quot;The People of the Crater&quot;, which appeared under the name &quot;Andrew North&quot; as pages 4–18 of the inaugural 1947 number of &quot;Fantasy Book&quot;, a magazine from Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc. Her first fantasy novel, &quot;Huon of the Horn&quot;, published by Harcourt Brace under her own name in 1951, adapted the 13th-century story of Huon, Duke of Bordeaux. Her first science fiction novel, &quot;Star Man&#x27;s Son, 2250 A.D.&quot;, appeared from Harcourt in 1952. She became a prolific novelist in the 1950s, with many of her books published for the juvenile market, at least in their original hardcover editions.

As of 1958, when she became a full-time professional writer, &quot;Kirkus&quot; had reviewed 16 of her novels, and awarded four of them starred reviews. Her four starred reviews to 1957 had been awarded for three historical adventure novels—&quot;Follow the Drum&quot; (1942), &quot;Scarface&quot; (1948), &quot;Yankee Privateer&quot; (1955)—and one cold war adventure, &quot;At Swords&#x27; Points&quot; (1954). She received four starred reviews subsequently, latest in 1966, including three for science fiction.

Norton was twice nominated for the Hugo Award, in 1964 for the novel &quot;Witch World&quot; and in 1967 for the novelette &quot;Wizard&#x27;s World&quot;. She was nominated three times for the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement, winning the award in 1998. Norton won a number of other genre awards and regularly had works appear in the &quot;Locus&quot; annual &quot;best of year&quot; polls.

She was a founding member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, led by Lin Carter, with entry by fantasy credentials alone. Norton was the only woman among the original eight members. Some works by SAGA members were published in Lin Carter&#x27;s &quot;Flashing Swords!&quot; anthologies.

In 1976, Gary Gygax invited Norton to play &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in his Greyhawk world. Norton subsequently wrote &quot;Quag Keep&quot;, which involved a group of characters who travel from the real world to Greyhawk. It was the first novel to be set, at least partially, in the Greyhawk setting and, according to &quot;Alternative Worlds&quot;, the first to be based on &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. &quot;Quag Keep&quot; was excerpted in Issue 12 of &quot;The Dragon&quot; (February 1978) just prior to the book&#x27;s release. She and Jean Rabe were collaborating on the sequel to &quot;Quag Keep&quot; when Norton died. &quot;Return to Quag Keep&quot; was completed by Rabe and published by Tor Books in January 2006.

Her final complete novel, &quot;Three Hands for Scorpio&quot;, was published on April 1, 2005. Besides &quot;Return to Quag Keep&quot;, Tor has published two more novels with Norton and Rabe credited as co-authors, &quot;Dragon Mage&quot; (November 2006) and &quot;Taste of Magic&quot; (January 2008). 

===Series===
Norton wrote more than a dozen speculative fiction series, but her longest, and longest-running project was &quot;Witch World&quot;, which began with the novel &quot;Witch World&quot; in 1963. The first six novels were Ace Books paperback originals published from 1963 to 1968. From the 1970s most of the books in the series were first published in hardcover editions. From the 1980s some were written by Norton and a co-author, and others were anthologies of short fiction for which she was editor. (Witch World became a shared universe.) There were dozens of books in all.

The five novels of The Cycle of Oak, Yew, Ash, and Rowan, &quot;To the King a Daughter&quot;, &quot;Knight or Knave&quot;, &quot;A Crown Disowned&quot;, &quot;Dragon Blade&quot;, and &quot;The Knight of the Red Beard&quot;, were written with Sasha Miller. The fifth and last novel was dedicated &quot;To my late collaborator, Andre Norton, whose vision inspired the NordornLand cycle.&quot; (&quot;NordornLand cycle&quot; is another name for this cycle.)

==Legacy==
Often called the Grande Dame of Science Fiction and Fantasy by biographers such as J. M. Cornwell, and organizations such as Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;, Andre Norton wrote novels for more than 70 years. She had a profound influence on the entire genre, having more than 300 published titles read by at least four generations of science fiction and fantasy readers and writers. Notable authors who cite her influence include Greg Bear, Lois McMaster Bujold, C. J. Cherryh, Cecilia Dart-Thornton, Tanya Huff, Mercedes Lackey, Charles de Lint, Joan D. Vinge, David Weber, K. D. Wentworth, and Catherine Asaro.

On February 20, 2005, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, which had honored Norton with its Grand Master Award in 1984, announced the creation of the Andre Norton Award, to be given each year for an outstanding work of fantasy or science fiction for the young adult literature market, beginning with 2005 publications. While the Norton Award is not a Nebula Award, it is voted on by SFWA members on the Nebula ballot and shares some procedures with the Nebula Awards. Nominally for a young adult book, actually the eligible class is middle grade and young adult novels. This added a category for genre fiction to be recognized and supported for young readers. Unlike Nebulas, there is a jury whose function is to expand the ballot beyond the six books with most nominations by members.

Norton received the Inkpot Award in 1989.

==High Hallack Library==
The High Hallack Library was a facility that Norton was instrumental in organizing and opening. Designed as a research facility for genre writers, and scholars of &quot;popular&quot; literature (the genres of science fiction, fantasy, mystery, western, romance, gothic, and horror), it was located near Norton&#x27;s home in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

The facility, named after one of the continents in Norton&#x27;s &quot;Witch World&quot; series, was home to more than 10,000 texts, videos, and various other media. Attached to the facility were three guest rooms, allowing authors and scholars the chance to stay on-site to facilitate their research goals.

The facility was opened on February 28, 1999, and operated until March 2004. Most of the collection was sold during the closing days of the facility. The declining health of Andre Norton was one of the leading causes of its closing.

<doc id="308041" wikidata="Q2342828" url="?curid=308041" title="Duke of Roxburghe">
<text>The Duke of Roxburghe () is a title in the peerage of Scotland created in 1707 along with the titles &quot;Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford&quot;, &quot;Earl of Kelso&quot; and &quot;Viscount Broxmouth&quot;. John Ker, 5th Earl of Roxburghe became the first holder of these titles. The title is derived from the royal burgh of Roxburgh in the Scottish Borders that in 1460 the Scots captured and destroyed.

Originally created Earl of Roxburghe in 1616, before the elevation to duke, a number of other subsidiary titles are held: &quot;Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford&quot; (created 1707), &quot;Earl of Kelso&quot; (1707), &quot;Earl Innes&quot; (1837), &quot;Viscount Broxmouth&quot; (1707), &quot;Lord Roxburghe&quot; (1600), and &quot;Lord Ker of Cessford and Cavertoun&quot; (1616). All of the titles form part of the peerage of Scotland, with the exception the Earldom of Innes, which belongs to the peerage of the United Kingdom. The Duke&#x27;s eldest son bears the courtesy title of &quot;Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford&quot;.

The dukedom and its associated titles descend to &quot;heirs who shall inherit the earldom&quot; which in turn had a very specific line of descent. On the death of the 4th duke the titles became dormant as no one could prove their claim. In 1812 the House of Lords ruled in favour of Sir James Innes-Ker, 6th Baronet, of Innes (see Innes baronets), rejecting claims by the heir female of the second earl and heir male whatsoever of the first earl.

The Duke of Roxburghe would be the Chief of Clan Innes, but cannot be so recognised as he retains the name &quot;Innes-Ker&quot;.

The family has its seat at Floors Castle near Kelso, Scotland. The grounds contain the ruins of Roxburgh Castle on a promontory between the rivers Tweed and Teviot. The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Roxburghe is the &quot;Roxburghe Memorial Cloister&quot; (also known as &quot;Roxburghe Aisle&quot;), a 20th-century addition to the ruins of Kelso Abbey.

<text>Băneasa () is a borough () on the north side of Bucharest, in Sector 1, near the Băneasa Lake (). Like every north-side district of Bucharest, it is relatively sparsely populated, with large areas of parkland. Bordering on Băneasa Forest, Băneasa hosts the Aurel Vlaicu International Airport, used mainly by private jets and business aviation, and is home to Zoo Băneasa, the Băneasa railway station, the Băneasa Shopping City, and the Embassy of the United States.

In the 2000s, the area has become increasingly upmarket, due to the construction of various luxury apartment developments in and around it (as are those in the Pipera-Tunari area). It is also home to many villas constructed before the 1930s that were refurbished in the 1990s and 2000s.

Băneasa is linked by RATB bus lines to the Bucharest city center. There is currently a proposal to construct an extension of the Bucharest Metro to serve this district and its increasing population.

The name of the village (and later of the Bucharest commune and neighborhood Băneasa) comes from the wife (băneasa) of Ban Mareș from the 17th century. The ban bought pieces of the Cârstienești estate (as the village was called then), and after his death the property was enlarged by to the widow.

<text>Nathan Sanford (November 5, 1777 – October 17, 1838) was an American politician.

== Early life ==
Sanford was born on November 5, 1777, in Bridgehampton, New York. He was the son of Thomas Sanford and Phebe (née Baker) Sanford, a family of farmers and tradesmen.

He attended Yale University, studied law, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in New York City.

==Career==
In 1803, he was appointed as United States Attorney for the District of New York, and remained in office until 1815 when the district was split into the Northern and the Southern District of New York. He was also the appellate lawyer for Jesse Pierson in the landmark case of Pierson v. Post.

He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1808-09 and 1811. In 1811, he was elected Speaker on January 29, but could not attend the session after February 10 because of ill health. The Assembly moved to elect a new Speaker and proceeded to the election of William Ross. He was a member of the New York State Senate (Southern D.) from 1812 to 1815, sitting in the 35th, 36th, 37th and 38th New York State Legislatures.

In 1815, he was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1815, to March 3, 1821. He was Chairman of the Committee on Commerce and Manufactures (15th and 16th United States Congresses), and a member of the Committee on Naval Affairs (15th Congress) and the Committee on Finance (16th Congress). In 1821, he ran for re-election as a Clintonian, but was defeated by Bucktail Martin Van Buren.

He was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821, and was Chancellor of New York from 1823 to 1826. In 1824, he received 30 electoral votes for U.S. Vice President.

In 1826, he resigned the chancellorship after his nomination in caucus, and was elected again to the U.S. Senate. He took his seat on January 31, 1826, and served until March 3, 1831. He was Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations (19th United States Congress). In this stint in the Senate, he generally aligned himself with President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law in Flushing, New York.

==Personal life==
Sanford was married three times. His first marriage was to Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; Van Horn (1780–1811). His residence in Flushing, &quot;Sanford Hall&quot;, became a private insane asylum in 1845, run by Dr. James Macdonald, MD and Gen. Allan Macdonald. Together, Nathan and Eliza were the parents of several children, including:

* Edward Sanford (1805–1876), a New York State Senator.
* Eliza Sanford, who married John Le Breton.
* Charles Sanford.
* Henry Sanford.

After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1811, Sanford was remarried to Mary Esther Malbone Isaacs (1790–1816), the eldest daughter of Col. Ralph Isaacs and Elizabeth (née Sebor) Isaacs, in 1813. Together, they were the parents of two children:

* Mary Sanford (1814–1841), who married Peter Gansevoort (1788–1876), also a New York State Senator.
* Henry Sanford (1816–1832), who died young.

After his second wife&#x27;s death, he remarried for a third time to Mary Buchanan (1800–1879), whom he married in May 1828. Together, they were the parents of:

* Robert Sanford (1831–1908), a Union College and New York Law School graduate.

He died in Flushing on October 17, 1838, and was buried at St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church Cemetery in Flushing.

<doc id="308046" wikidata="Q1095605" url="?curid=308046" title="Claris">
<text>Claris International Inc., formerly FileMaker Inc., is a computer software development company formed as a subsidiary company of Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) in 1987. It was given the source code and copyrights to several programs that were owned by Apple, notably MacWrite and MacPaint, in order to separate Apple&#x27;s application software activities from its hardware and operating systems activities.

In 1998, the company divested itself of all but its flagship product, and reformed as FileMaker Inc. In 2019, FileMaker Inc. announced at DevCon that it was restoring the Claris brand name. Also in 2019, Claris acquired Italian startup, Stamplay, a cloud-based integration platform which connects web services like Dropbox and Slack without writing code, and announced they would rename their product offering as Claris Connect.

The company develops, supports and markets the relational database program FileMaker. The FileMaker Platform is available for the macOS, Microsoft Windows and iOS operating systems and is aimed towards business users and power users.

== History ==


In the early days of the Mac, Apple shipped the machines with two basic programs, MacWrite and MacPaint, so that users would have a working machine &quot;out of the box&quot;. However, this resulted in complaints from third-party developers, who felt that these programs were good enough for so many users that there was little reason to buy something better.

Apple decided to allow the programs to &quot;wither&quot; so that the third-party developers would have time to write suitable replacements. The developers did not seem to hold up their end of the bargain, and it was some time before truly capable replacements like WriteNow came along. In the meantime users complained about the lack of upgrades, while the third-party developers continued to complain about the &quot;possibility&quot; of upgrades.

Eventually Apple decided the only solution was to spin off the products to a third party of its own creation, forming Claris in 1987. Claris was also given the rights to several lesser-known Apple products such as MacProject, MacDraw, and the hit Apple II product AppleWorks. Claris&#x27; second corporate headquarters (nicknamed &quot;The Wedge&quot;) was in Santa Clara, about six miles from the main Apple campus.

At first Claris provided only trivial upgrades, limited to making the products continue to run on newer versions of the Macintosh operating system. In 1988, Claris purchased FileMaker from Nashoba Systems and quickly released a rebranded version called FileMaker II, to conform to its naming scheme for other products, such as MacWrite II. The product, however, changed little from the last Nashoba version. Several minor versions followed; it was succeeded by FileMaker Pro 1.0 in 1990. In the meantime, development began on major overhauls of their entire product line, including FileMaker. Each of these would be eventually released as part of the Pro series of products.

In 1990, Apple decided that Claris should remain a wholly owned subsidiary, as opposed to being completely spun off in an initial public offering. The company president soon left, and over the next year most of the other executives followed.

That same year Claris also purchased an integrated application written by two former Claris employees. After rebranding in a style similar to FileMaker, MacDraw, and MacWrite, it was released in 1991 as ClarisWorks, and became another huge success for the company. After a lengthy series of ups and downs, this product was eventually taken back by Apple in 1998 and rebranded as AppleWorks (for Macintosh).

In September 1992, Claris released a cross-platform version of FileMaker for both the Mac and Windows; except for a few platform-specific functions, the program&#x27;s features and user interface were the same. Up to this point FileMaker had no real relational capabilities; it was limited to automatically looking up and importing values from other files. It only had the ability to save a state—a filter and a sort, and a layout for the data. Version 3.0, released around 1995, introduced new relational and scripting features.

=== Transition to FileMaker Inc. ===

By the mid-1990s it appeared to most observers that Apple was in serious danger of disappearing. The main ClarisWorks development team left Claris, disillusioned with the product and the market, and founded Gobe Software, which produced a Claris-like office suite for BeOS.

Facing declining sales, Claris management decided that FileMaker was the only product worth keeping, and put all of the rest of the products on indefinite hold. By 1998 the transition was complete and the company renamed itself as FileMaker Inc. Claris&#x27;s only other major product, ClarisWorks, was taken back by Apple to become AppleWorks. The company kept FileMaker and Claris HomePage 3.0. The latter was discontinued in 2001 leaving FileMaker as its lone offering until January 8, 2008, when the company released Bento, a template-based database application with a leaning toward information from other applications. Bento was discontinued on September 30, 2013.

=== Return to Claris ===
During DevCon 2019, the developers&#x27; conference, FileMaker announced it was resurrecting the Claris name and re-branding commenced. FileMaker Inc. changed its name to Claris International. The FileMaker product name remains as Claris FileMaker.

== Products ==

=== FileMaker ===

FileMaker is a cross-platform relational database application. It integrates a database engine with a graphical user interface (GUI) and security features, allowing users to modify the database by dragging new elements into layouts, screens, or forms. It started as an MS-DOS app called Nutshell, developed by Nashoba Systems.

=== Pro series ===

In the late 1980s, Claris began a major upgrade effort, rewriting all of its products to use a more modern and common user interface. The result was the &quot;Pro&quot; series: MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro, and FileMaker Pro. In order to provide a complete office suite they later purchased the rights to the Informix Wingz spreadsheet on the Mac, rebranding it as Claris Resolve, and added the new presentation program Claris Impact.

The series was released piecemeal over a period of about two years, during which period Microsoft was able to dominate the market with Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. While the Claris packages were arguably much more &quot;approachable&quot; than the Microsoft applications, the Claris software applications lacked some features of the now-mature Microsoft suite, leaving them lacking in &quot;checkbox features.&quot; Their value was further eroded by aggressive bundling deals from Microsoft that could allow Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to be purchased for a cost not much higher than MacWrite alone—a bundle that Claris did not match. Claris did offer ClarisWorks, an all-in-one package; and, while the price was right, ClarisWorks was very limited and could not compete in the business market. Microsoft also released a Works package.

Microsoft&#x27;s domination of the Macintosh office suite software marketplace would be replicated five years later when (following the release of Windows 95), Microsoft Office crushed its two main rivals in Windows software: the WordPerfect/Quattro Pro suite and the Lotus SmartSuite.

=== Other applications ===

By the late 1980s, HyperCard needed updating as well but Apple management did not see any value in the product and let it wither. Complaints eventually became loud enough that they decided &quot;something&quot; had to be done. Studying the problem, they decided that all software should be released through Claris, and sent HyperCard and the Mac OS to them. Many of the developers refused to move to Claris, leading to a serious split in development that delayed future releases of both products. The Mac OS was soon returned to Apple; HyperCard was ignored for a time, before also returning briefly as a part of the QuickTime group.

In 1988, Claris published Claris CAD, a 2-D CAD package, and Claris Graphics Translator, a translation package for Claris CAD.

In early 1989, Claris published SmartForm Designer, software to design forms, and a companion product, SmartForm Assistant, software to fill forms created by SmartForm Designer.

In 1994, Claris published Amazing Animation, software aimed at children and young teenagers, allowing them to produce their own short animated films.

In 1995, Claris purchased and released Claris Home Page, which enjoyed popularity as one of the few truly GUI-based WYSIWYG HTML editors of the time.

Other products added to the line included Claris Emailer; Claris OfficeMail, which facilitated setup by non-specialists and Claris Organizer. These products were part of a new effort to diversify Claris and no longer chase the &quot;office&quot; market which, by this point, was considered a lost cause.

The Bento database product aimed at home users or small businesses was released in 2008 and discontinued in 2013.

<doc id="308050" wikidata="Q529211" url="?curid=308050" title="Frederik Ruysch">
<text>Frederik Ruysch (; March 28, 1638 – February 22, 1731) was a Dutch botanist and anatomist. He is known for developing techniques for preserving anatomical specimens, which he used to create dioramas or scenes incorporating human parts. His anatomical preparations included over 2,000 anatomical, pathological, zoological, and botanical specimens, which were preserved by either drying or embalming. Ruysch is also known for his proof of valves in the lymphatic system, the vomeronasal organ in snakes, and &quot;arteria centralis oculi&quot; (the central artery of the eye). He was the first to describe the disease that is today known as Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease, as well as several pathological conditions, including intracranial teratoma, enchondromatosis, and Majewski syndrome.

==Life==
Frederik Ruysch was born in The Hague as the son of a government functionary and started as the pupil of a druggist. Fascinated by anatomy, he studied at the university of Leiden, under Franciscus Sylvius. His fellow students were Jan Swammerdam, Reinier de Graaf and Niels Stensen. The dissection of corpses was relatively expensive and cadavers were scarce, which led Ruysch to find alternative ways to prepare the organs. In 1661, he married Maria Post, daughter of the Dutch architect,
Pieter Post. He graduated in 1664 with a thesis on pleuritis.

Ruysch became &quot;praelector&quot; of the Amsterdam surgeon&#x27;s guild in 1667. In 1668, he was made the chief instructor to the city&#x27;s midwives. They were no longer allowed to practice their profession until they had been examined by Ruysch. In 1679, he was appointed as a forensic advisor to the Amsterdam courts and in 1685 as a professor of botany in the Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam, where he worked with Jan and Caspar Commelin. Ruysch specialized in indigenous plants.

==Embalming technique==
Ruysch researched many areas of human anatomy, and physiology, using spirits to preserve organs, and assembled one of Europe&#x27;s most famous anatomical collections. His chief skill was the preparation and preservation of specimens in a secret &quot;liquor balsamicum&quot;, and he is believed to be one of the first to use arterial embalming to this effect. He developed an injection from mercuric sulfide, which originated from cinnabar, a naturally occurring red-colored mineral. The injection gave many specimens a reddish, almost lively expression. Thanks to this technique, observers could visualize and dissect even the smallest blood vessels, which was a groundbreaking technique in the 17th century. Ruysch&#x27;s revolutionary embalming techniques also allowed for the corpses to be preserved for a greater period of time. This not only extended the time allowed for each dissection presentation but also made it possible for these presentations to take place during the warmer months.

==Ruysch&#x27;s cabinet==
Frederik Ruysch was both the founder and creator of a museum of anatomy, which was located within his own private residence. The museum was a popular tourist attraction for Amsterdam and was known throughout the educated world. It was a private collection, but Ruysch opened it to the public. An admission was charged, and a guide headed tours throughout the five rooms. The collection was separated into three different categories. Dry preparations included skeletons and dried organs, wet injection preparations included preservations in bottles with easily removable lids, and the last category was wet preparations in jugs with elaborate decorations. The last category could not be handled easily without risking damage to the preparation itself.

Unique to his collections were the inclusion of infant and fetal bodies, which composed approximately one-third of his entire collection. He purchased the majority of these specimens from midwives that worked under him, after the child died or when a pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage. His still lifes and displays that contained the bodies of infants, or parts thereof, were typically displayed with clothing, bonnets, or even glass eyes. By adding these elements, Ruysch was able to cover the marks and stitches from the embalming process and give his displays a more lifelike appearance. While some of his displays had abnormalities and defects, the main goal of his collections was to create works of art that he believed showed the perfection of the human body. In her early years, his daughter Rachel Ruysch, a painter of still lifes, had helped him to decorate the collection with flowers, fishes, seashells and the delicate body parts with lace.

By the time Ruysch was 24, his cabinet had become extremely popular and attracted the attention of many foreign dignitaries. In 1697, Peter the Great and Nicolaes Witsen visited Ruysch who had all the specimens exposed in five rooms, on two days during the week open for the public. He told Peter, who had a keen interest in science, how to catch butterflies and how to preserve them. They also had a common interest in lizards. Together they went to see patients. In 1717, during his second visit, Ruysch sold his &quot;repository of curiosities&quot; to Peter the Great for 30,000 guilders, including the secret of the liquor: clotted pig&#x27;s blood, Berlin blue and mercury oxide. Ruysch refused to help when everything had to be packed and labelled. It took Albert Seba more than a month. The 100 colli were not sent immediately, but because of the Great Nordic War in the year after, divided over two ships. The collection was intact, and the rumours about the sailors that drunk the alcohol, are untrue.

Ruysch immediately began anew in his house on Bloemgracht, in the Jordaan. After his death this collection was sold to August the Strong. While some of his preserved collections remain, none of his scenes have survived. They are only known through a number of engravings, notably those by Cornelis Huyberts.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1715. He was painted by his son-in-law Jurriaen Pool. Frederik Ruysch published together with Herman Boerhaave.

In 1760 (30 years after his death), botanist Jacq. published &quot;Ruyschia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from South America, belonging to the family Marcgraviaceae and named in Frederik Ruysch&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="308054" wikidata="Q2115026" url="?curid=308054" title="Presentation program">
<text>In computing, a presentation program (also called presentation software) is a software package used to display information in the form of a slide show. It has three major functions:

* an editor that allows text to be inserted and formatted
* a method for inserting and manipulating graphic images and media clips
* a slide-show system to display the content

Presentation software can be viewed as enabling a functionally-specific category of electronic media, with its own distinct culture and practices as compared to traditional presentation media (such as blackboards, whiteboards and flip charts).

Presentations in this mode of delivery have become pervasive in many aspects of business communication, especially in business planning, as well as in academic-conference and professional conference settings, and in the knowledge economy generally, where ideas are a primary work output. Presentations may also feature prominently in political settings, especially in workplace politics, where persuasion is a central determinant of group outcomes.

Most modern meeting-rooms and conference halls are configured to include presentation electronics, such as projectors suitable for displaying presentation slides, often driven by the presenter&#x27;s own laptop, under direct control of the presentation program used to develop the presentation. Often a presenter will present a lecture using the slides as a visual aid both for the presenter (to track the lecture&#x27;s coverage) and for the audience (especially when an audience member mishears or misunderstands the verbal component).

Generally in presentations, the visual material is considered supplemental to a strong aural presentation that accompanies the slide show, but in many cases, such as statistical graphics, it can be difficult to convey essential information other than by visual means; additionally, a well-designed infographic can be extremely effective in a way that words are not. Endemic over-reliance on slides with low information density and with a poor accompanying lecture has given presentation software a negative reputation as sometimes functioning as a crutch for the poorly informed or the poorly prepared.

==List of presentation programs==

==History==

Using Autographix and Dicomed, it became quite easy to make last-minute changes compared to traditional typesetting and pasteup. It was also a lot easier to produce a large number of slides in a small amount of time. However, these workstations also required skilled operators, and a single workstation represented an investment of $50,000 to $200,000 (in 1979 dollars).

In the mid-1980s developments in the world of computers changed the way presentations were created. Inexpensive, specialized applications now made it possible for anyone with a PC to create professional-looking presentation graphics.

Originally these programs were used to generate 35 mm slides, to be presented using a slide projector. As these programs became more common in the late 1980s several companies set up services that would accept the shows on diskette and create slides using a film recorder or print transparencies. In the 1990s dedicated LCD-based screens that could be placed on the projectors started to replace the transparencies, and by the early 2000s they had almost all been replaced by video projectors.

The first commercial computer software specifically intended for creating WYSIWYG presentations was developed at Hewlett-Packard in 1979 and called BRUNO and later HP-Draw. The first microcomputer-based presentation software was Cromemco&#x27;s Slidemaster, developed by John F. Dunn and released by Cromemco in 1981. The first software displaying a presentation on a personal computer screen was VCN ExecuVision, developed in 1982. This program allowed users to choose from a library of images to accompany the text of their presentation. Harvard Graphics was introduced for MS-DOS and Lotus Freelance Graphics was introduced for DOS and OS/2 in 1986. PowerPoint was introduced for the Macintosh computer in 1987.

==Features==
A presentation program is supposed to help both the speaker with an easier access to his ideas and the participants with visual information which complements the talk.
There are many different types of presentations including professional (work-related), education, entertainment, and for general communication. Presentation programs can either supplement or replace the use of older visual-aid technology, such as pamphlets, handouts, chalkboards, flip charts, posters, slides and overhead transparencies. Text, graphics, movies, and other objects are positioned on individual pages or &quot;slides&quot; or &quot;foils&quot;. The &quot;slide&quot; analogy is a reference to the slide projector, a device that has become somewhat obsolete due to the use of presentation software. Slides can be printed, or (more usually) displayed on-screen and navigated through at the command of the presenter. An entire presentation can be saved in video format. The slides can also be saved as images of any image file formats for any future reference. Transitions between slides can be animated in a variety of ways, as can the emergence of elements on a slide itself. Typically a presentation has many constraints and the most important being the limited time to present consistent information.

Many presentation programs come with pre-designed images (clip art) and/or have the ability to import graphic images. Some tools also have the ability to search and import images from Flickr or Google directly from the tool. Custom graphics can also be created in other programs such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP and then exported. The concept of clip art originated with the image library that came as a complement with VCN ExecuVision, beginning in 1983.

With the growth of digital photography and video, many programs that handle these types of media also include presentation functions for displaying them in a similar &quot;slide show&quot; format, for example iPhoto. These programs allow groups of digital photos to be displayed in a slide show with options such as selecting transitions, choosing whether or not the show stops at the end or continues to loop, and including music to accompany the photos.

Similar to programming extensions for an operating system or web browser, &quot;add ons&quot; or plugins for presentation programs can be used to enhance their capabilities.

Apps can enable a smartphone to be a remote control for slideshow presentations, including slide previews, speaker notes, timer, stop watch, pointer, going directly to a given slide, blank screen and more. Presentation programs also offer an interactive integrated hardware element designed to engage an audience (e.g. audience response systems, second screen applications) or facilitate presentations across different geographical locations through the internet (e.g. web conferencing). Hardware devices such as laser pointers and interactive whiteboards can ease the job of a live presenter .

<doc id="308056" wikidata="Q877806" url="?curid=308056" title="Overhead projector">
<text>An overhead projector (often abbreviated to OHP), like a film or slide projector, uses light to project an enlarged image on a screen, allowing the view of a small document or picture to be shared with a large audience.

In the overhead projector, the source of the image is a page-sized sheet of transparent plastic film (also known as &quot;viewfoils&quot;, &quot;foils&quot; or &quot;transparencies&quot;) with the image to be projected either printed or hand-written/drawn. These transparent sheets are placed on the glass platen of the projector, which has a light source below it and a projecting mirror and lens assembly above it (hence, &quot;overhead&quot;). They were widely used in education and business before the advent of video projectors.

==Optical system==

An overhead projector works on the same principle as a slide projector, in which a focusing lens projects light from an illuminated slide onto a projection screen where a real image is formed. However some differences are necessitated by the much larger size of the transparencies used (generally the size of a printed page), and the requirement that the transparency be placed face up (and readable to the presenter). For the latter purpose, the projector includes a mirror just before or after the focusing lens to fold the optical system toward the horizontal. That mirror also accomplishes a reversal of the image in order that the image projected onto the screen corresponds to that of the slide as seen by the presenter looking down at it, rather than a mirror image thereof. Therefore, the transparency is placed face up (toward the mirror and focusing lens), in contrast with a 35mm slide projector or film projector (which lack such a mirror) where the slide&#x27;s image is non-reversed on the side &quot;opposite&quot; the focusing lens.

A related invention for enlarging transparent images is the solar camera. The opaque projector, or episcope is a device which displays opaque materials by shining a bright lamp onto the object from above. The episcope must be distinguished from the diascope, which is a projector used for projecting images of transparent objects (such as films or slides), and from the epidiascope, which is capable of projecting images of both opaque and transparent objects.

===Condenser===
Because the focusing lens (typically less than in diameter) is much smaller than the transparency, a crucial role is played by the optical condenser which illuminates the transparency. Since this requires a large optical lens (at least the size of the transparency) but may be of poor optical quality (since the sharpness of the image does not depend on it), a Fresnel lens is employed. The Fresnel lens is located at (or is part of) the glass plate on which the transparency is placed, and serves to redirect most of the light hitting it into a converging cone toward the focusing lens. Without such a condenser at that point, most of the light would miss the focusing lens (or else the focusing lens would have to be very large and prohibitively expensive). Additionally, mirrors or other condensing elements below the Fresnel lens serve to increase the portion of the light bulb&#x27;s output which reaches the Fresnel lens in the first place. In order to provide sufficient light on the screen, a high intensity bulb is used which often requires fan cooling.

===Focus adjustment===
Overhead projectors normally include a manual focusing mechanism which raises and lowers the position of the focusing lens (including the folding mirror) in order to adjust the object distance (optical distance between the slide and the lens) to focus at the chosen image distance (distance to the projection screen) given the fixed focal length of the focusing lens. This permits a range of projection distances.

Increasing (or decreasing) the projection distance increases (or decreases) the focusing system&#x27;s magnification in order to fit the projection screen in use (or sometimes just to accommodate the room setup). Increasing the projection distance also means that the same amount of light is spread over a larger screen, resulting in a dimmer image. With a change in the projection distance, the focusing must be readjusted for a sharp image. However, the condensing optics (Fresnel lens) is optimized for one particular vertical position of the lens, corresponding to one projection distance. Therefore, when it is focused for a greatly different projection distance, part of the light cone projected by the Fresnel lens towards the focusing lens misses that lens. This has the greatest effect towards the outer edges of the projected image, so that one typically sees either blue or brown fringing at the edge of the screen when the focus is towards an extreme. Using the projector near its recommended projection distance allows a focusing position where this is avoided and the intensity across the screen is approximately uniform.

===Source of illumination===
The lamp technology of an overhead projector is typically very simple compared to a modern LCD or DLP video projector. Most overheads use an extremely high-power halogen lamp that may consume up to 750 or 1000 watts. A high-flow blower is required to keep the bulb from melting due to the heat generated, and this blower is often on a timer that keeps it running for a period after the light is extinguished.

Further, the intense heat accelerates failure of the high intensity lamp, often burning out in less than 100 hours, requiring replacement, which is often the most expensive part of owning a projector. In contrast, a modern LCD or DLP projector often uses an Ultra-high-performance lamp which has a higher luminous efficacy and lasts for thousands of hours. A drawback of that technology is the warm up time required for such lamps.

Older overhead projectors used a tubular quartz bulb which was mounted above a bowl-shaped polished reflector. However, because the lamp was suspended above and outside the reflector, a large amount of light was cast to the sides inside the projector body that was wasted, thus requiring a higher power lamp for sufficient screen illumination. More modern overhead projectors use an integrated lamp and conical reflector assembly, allowing the lamp to be located deep within the reflector and sending a greater portion of its light towards the Fresnel lens; this permits using a lower power lamp for the same screen illumination.

A useful innovation for overhead projectors with integrated lamps/reflectors is the quick-swap dual-lamp control, allowing two lamps to be installed in the projector in movable sockets. If one lamp fails during a presentation the presenter can merely move a lever to slide the spare into position and continue with the presentation, without needing to open the projection unit or waiting for the failed bulb to cool before replacing it.

==History==
Some ancient projectors like the magic lantern can be regarded as predecessors of the overhead projector. The steganographic mirror possibly came closest to how the overhead projector was used.

German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s 1645 book &quot;Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae&quot; included a description of his invention, the &quot;Steganographic Mirror&quot;: a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long-distance communication. In 1654 Belgian Jesuit mathematician André Tacquet used Kircher&#x27;s technique to show the journey from China to Belgium of Italian Jesuit missionary Martino Martini. It is unknown how exactly Tacquet used Kircher&#x27;s system, but it is imagined that he drew pictures on the projecting mirror while details of the journey were explained.

The &quot;solar microscope&quot; was employed in early photographic experiments with photosensitive silver nitrate by Thomas Wedgwood and Humphry Davy in making the first, but impermanent, enlargements of minute objects.

French physicist Edmond Becquerel developed the first known overhead projection apparatus in 1853. It was demonstrated by French instrument maker and inventor Jules Duboscq in 1866.

Subsequently, in 1857 Baltimore painter David Acheson Woodward&#x27; patented a solar enlarging camera, a large instrument operated out-of-doors. It used sunlight and copying lenses for enlargements from a small negative onto large photographically sensitized paper or canvas. Portrait artists found it a boon that provided a guide in making accurate likenesses which they would paint in oils, watercolour or pastel over the enlargement, often made at life size.

An overhead projector designed by American scientist Henry Morton was marketed around 1880 as a &quot;vertical lantern&quot;.

The use of transparent sheets for overhead projection, called viewfoils or viewgraphs, was largely developed in the United States. Overhead projectors were introduced into U.S. military training during World War II as early as 1940 and were quickly being taken up by tertiary educators, and within the decade they were being used in corporations. After the war they were used at schools like the U.S. Military Academy. The journal &quot;Higher Education&quot; of April 1952 noted;

Allied to the US Navy development of the improved lightweight overhead projector was its adaptation of the Ozalid dry printing process, developed in Germany in 1923, to copy training documents and illustrations on projection transparencies, a process simple enough to be carried out in the field and which ensured uniformity of instructional material used.

Overhead projectors were used early on for police work with a cellophane roll over a 9-inch stage, allowing facial characteristics to be rolled across the stage.

As the demand for projectors grew, Buhl Industries was founded in 1953, and became the leading US contributor for several optical refinements for the overhead projector and its projection lens.

Overhead projectors began to be widely used in schools and businesses in the late 1950s and early 1960s, beside the contemporaneously developed carousel slide projectors with a horizontally mounted tray manufactured by Kodak.

In the late 1950s Roger Appeldorn was challenged by his boss at 3M to find a use for the transparencies that were the waste of their color copy process. Appeldorn developed a process for the projection of transparent sheets that led to 3M&#x27;s first marketable transparency film. The Strategic Air Command base in Omaha was one of the first big clients, using circa 20,000 sheets per month. 3M then decided to develop their own overhead projector instead of the one they had been selling until then, which was produced by an outside manufacturer. It took several prototypes before a cost-effective, small and foldable version could be presented on January 15, 1962. It had a new Fresnel lens made with a structured-surface plastic, much better than other plastic lenses and much cheaper than glass.
In 1957, the United States&#x27; first Federal Aid to Education program stimulated overhead sales which remained high up to the late 1990s and into the 21st Century.

=== Use in education ===
Overhead projectors were widely used in education and business before the advent of computer-based projection.

The overhead projector facilitates an easy low-cost interactive environment for educators. Teaching materials can be pre-printed on plastic sheets, upon which the educator can directly write using a non-permanent, washable color marking pen. This saves time, since the transparency can be pre-printed and used repetitively, rather than having materials written manually before each class.

The overhead is typically placed at a comfortable writing height for the educator and allows the educator to face the class, facilitating better communication between the students and teacher. The enlarging features of the projector allow the educator to write in a comfortable small script in a natural writing position rather than writing in an overly large script on a blackboard and having to constantly hold their arm out in midair to write on the blackboard.

When the transparency sheet is full of written or drawn material, it can simply be replaced with a new, fresh sheet with more pre-printed material, again saving class time vs a blackboard that would need to be erased and teaching materials rewritten by the educator. Following the class period, the transparencies are easily restored to their original unused state by washing off with soap and water.

=== LCD overhead displays ===

In the early 1980s–1990s, overhead projectors were used as part of a classroom computer display/projection system. A liquid-crystal panel mounted in a plastic frame was placed on top of the overhead projector and connected to the video output of the computer, often splitting off the normal monitor output. A cooling fan in the frame of the LCD panel would blow cooling air across the LCD to prevent overheating that would fog the image.

The first of these LCD panels were monochrome-only, and could display NTSC video output such as from an Apple II computer or VCR. In the late 1980s, color models became available, capable of &quot;thousands&quot; of colors (16-bit color), for the color Macintosh and VGA PCs. The displays were never particularly fast to refresh or update, resulting in the smearing of fast-moving images, but it was acceptable when nothing else was available.

The Do-It-Yourself community has started using this idea to make low-cost home theater projectors. By removing the casing and backlight assembly of a common LCD monitor, one can use the exposed LCD screen in conjunction with the overhead projector to project the contents of the LCD screen to the wall at a much lower cost than with standard LCD projectors. Due to the mirroring of the image in the head of the overhead projector, the image on the wall is &quot;re-flipped&quot; to where it would be if one was looking at the LCD screen normally.

===Decline in use===
Overhead projectors were once a common fixture in most classrooms and business conference rooms in the United States, but in the 2000s they were slowly replaced by document cameras, dedicated computer projection systems and interactive whiteboards. Such systems allow the presenter to project directly from an application such as Microsoft PowerPoint or LibreOffice, and presentations can include animations, interactive components, and video clips. The image quality from these systems is generally better than an overhead projector. The need to print or photocopy color transparencies is eliminated.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Rüstow (25 May 1821 – 14 August 1878) was a Prussian-born Swiss soldier and military writer.

Rüstow was born in Brandenburg an der Havel in the Province of Brandenburg. He entered the Prussian Army and served for some years, until the publication of &quot;Der deutsche Militärstaat vor und während der Revolution&quot; (Zürich, 1850). Rüstow participated in the Revolution of 1848. He was sentenced by a court-martial to 32½ years of fortress imprisonment, but succeeded in escaping to Switzerland, where he obtained a military posting. By 1857 he was a major on the engineer staff.

Three years later Rüstow accompanied Giuseppe Garibaldi in the famous expedition against the Two Sicilies as colonel and Chief of staff, and to him must be ascribed the victories of Capua (10 September 1860) and Volturno (1 October 1860). At the end of the campaign he settled down in Zürich. At the outbreak of the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, he offered his services to Prussia, but was rejected. In 1878, on the foundation of a military professorship at Zürich, Rüstow applied for the post, but taught only short, and, on its being given finally to another officer (Emil Rothpletz), lost heart and committed suicide at Aussersihl near Zürich.

Two of Rüstow&#x27;s younger brothers were distinguished Prussian soldiers, Alexander Rüstow and Cäsar Rüstow. He was also the great-uncle of the sociologist Alexander Rüstow.

<doc id="308058" wikidata="Q243289" url="?curid=308058" title="Magnetic declination">
<text>Magnetic declination (also called magnetic variation) is the angle between magnetic north and true north at a particular location on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The angle can change over time due to polar wandering.

Magnetic north is the direction that the north end of a magnetized compass needle points, which corresponds to the direction of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field lines. True north is the direction along a meridian towards the geographic North Pole.

Somewhat more formally, Bowditch defines variation as &quot;the angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes east or west to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north. The angle between magnetic and grid meridians is called grid magnetic angle, grid variation, or grivation.&quot;

By convention, declination is positive when magnetic north is east of true north, and negative when it is to the west. &quot;Isogonic lines&quot; are lines on the Earth&#x27;s surface along which the declination has the same constant value, and lines along which the declination is zero are called &quot;agonic lines&quot;. The lowercase Greek letter δ (delta) is frequently used as the symbol for magnetic declination.

The term &quot;magnetic deviation&quot; is sometimes used loosely to mean the same as magnetic declination, but more correctly it refers to the error in a compass reading induced by nearby metallic objects, such as iron on board a ship or aircraft.

Magnetic declination should not be confused with &quot;magnetic inclination&quot;, also known as magnetic dip, which is the angle that the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field lines make with the downward side of the horizontal plane.

== Declination change over time and location ==
Magnetic declination varies both from place to place and with the passage of time. As a traveller cruises the east coast of the United States, for example, the declination varies from 16 degrees west in Maine, to 6 in Florida, to 0 degrees in Louisiana, to 4 degrees east in Texas. The declination at London, UK was one degree west (2014), reducing to zero as of early 2020. Reports of measured magnetic declination for distant locations became commonplace in the 17th century, and Edmund Halley made a map of declination for the Atlantic Ocean in 1700.

In most areas, the spatial variation reflects the irregularities of the flows deep in the Earth; in some areas, deposits of iron ore or magnetite in the Earth&#x27;s crust may contribute strongly to the declination. Similarly, secular changes to these flows result in slow changes to the field strength and direction at the same point on the Earth.

The magnetic declination in a given area may (most likely will) change slowly over time, possibly as little as 2–2.5 degrees every hundred years or so, depending on where it is measured. For a location close to the pole like Ivujivik, the declination may change by 1 degree every three years. This may be insignificant to most travellers, but can be important if using magnetic bearings from old charts or metes (directions) in old deeds for locating places with any precision.

As an example of how variation changes over time, see the two charts of the same area (western end of Long Island Sound), below, surveyed 124 years apart. The 1884 chart shows a variation of 8 degrees, 20 minutes West. The 2008 chart shows 13 degrees, 15 minutes West.

== Determination ==
=== Field measurement ===
The magnetic declination at any particular place can be measured directly by reference to the celestial poles—the points in the heavens around which the stars appear to revolve, which mark the direction of true north and true south. The instrument used to perform this measurement is known as a &quot;declinometer&quot;.

The approximate position of the north celestial pole is indicated by Polaris (the North Star). In the northern hemisphere, declination can therefore be approximately determined as the difference between the magnetic bearing and a visual bearing on Polaris. Polaris currently traces a circle 0.73° in radius around the north celestial pole, so this technique is accurate to within a degree. At high latitudes a plumb-bob is helpful to sight Polaris against a reference object close to the horizon, from which its bearing can be taken.
===Determination from maps ===
A rough estimate of the local declination (within a few degrees) can be determined from a general isogonic chart of the world or a continent, such as those illustrated above. Isogonic lines are also shown on aeronautical and nautical charts.

Larger-scale local maps may indicate current local declination, often with the aid of a schematic diagram. Unless the area depicted is very small, declination may vary measurably over the extent of the map, so the data may be referred to a specific location on the map. The current rate and direction of change may also be shown, for example in arcminutes per year. The same diagram may show the angle of grid north (the direction of the map&#x27;s north–south grid lines), which may differ from true north.

On the topographic maps of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), for example, a diagram shows the relationship between magnetic north in the area concerned (with an arrow marked &quot;MN&quot;) and true north (a vertical line with a five-pointed star at its top), with a label near the angle between the MN arrow and the vertical line, stating the size of the declination and of that angle, in degrees, mils, or both. However, the diagram itself is not an accurate depiction of the stated numerical declination angle, but is intentionally exaggerated by the cartographer for purposes of legibility.

=== Models and software ===

Worldwide empirical model of the deep flows described above are available for describing and predicting features of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, including the magnetic declination for any given location at any time in a given timespan. One such model is World Magnetic Model (WMM) of the US and UK. It is built with all the information available to the map-makers at the start of the five-year period it is prepared for. It reflects a highly predictable rate of change, and is usually more accurate than a map—which is likely months or years out of date. For historical data, the IGRF and GUFM models may be used. Tools for using such models include:

* Web apps hosted by the National Geophysical Data Center, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States.
* C demo program that for WMM by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, along with various other third-party implementations.

The WMM, IGRF, and GUFM models only describe the magnetic field as emitted at the core-mantle boundary. In practice, the magnetic field is also distorted by the Earth crust, the distortion being magnetic anomaly. For more precise estimates, a larger crust-aware model such as the Enhanced Magnetic Model may be used. (See cited page for a comparison of declination contours.)

== Compass Declination Adjustment ==

=== Rotating dial compasses ===

A magnetic compass points to magnetic north, not geographic (true) north. Compasses of the style commonly used for hiking (i.e., baseplate or protractor compass) utilize a dial or bezel which rotates 360 degrees and is independent of the magnetic needle. To manually establish a declination for true north, the bezel is rotated until the desired number of degrees lie between the bezel&#x27;s designation N (for North) and the direction (east or west) of magnetic north indicated by the polarized tip of the needle (usually painted red). The entire compass is then rotated until the magnetic needle lies within the outlined orienting arrow or box on the bottom of the capsule, and the course heading (in degrees) is displayed at the base of the direction-of-travel arrow on the baseplate. A compass thus adjusted provides a course bearing in relation to true north instead of magnetic north as long as it remains within an area on the same isogonic line.

In the image at the right, the bezel&#x27;s N has been aligned with the direction indicated by the magnetic end of the compass needle, adjusted for local declination (10 degrees west of magnetic north). The direction-of-travel arrow on the baseplate thus reflects a true north heading. 
After determining local declination, a rotating dial compass may be altered to give true north readings by taping or painting a small delta-point or arrowhead on the compass baseplate west or east of magnetic north pointing to true north on the compass bezel. Other compasses of this design utilize an adjustable declination mechanism integrated with the compass bezel, resulting in true north readings each time the needle is aligned with the orienting arrow.

=== Floating magnetic card compasses ===
Compasses that utilize a floating magnetized dial or card are commonly found in marine compasses and in certain models used for land navigation that feature a lensatic or prismatic sighting system. A floating card compass always gives bearings in relation to magnetic north and cannot be adjusted for declination. True north must be computed by adding or subtracting local magnetic declination. The example on the left demonstrates a typical conversion of a magnetic bearing from a floating card compass to a true bearing by &quot;adding&quot; the magnetic declination. The declination in the example is 14°E (+14°). If, instead, the declination was 14°W (−14°), you would still “add” it to the magnetic bearing to obtain the true bearing: 40°+ (−14°) = 26°.

Conversely, local declination is &quot;subtracted&quot; from a true bearing to obtain a magnetic bearing. With a local declination of 14°E, a true bearing (i.e. obtained from a map) of 54° is converted to a magnetic bearing (for use in the field) by subtracting declination: 54° – 14° = 40°. If the local declination was 14°W (−14°), it is again subtracted from the true bearing to obtain a magnetic bearing: 54°- (−14°) = 68°.
== Navigation ==
On aircraft or vessels there are three types of bearing: true, magnetic, and compass bearing. Compass error is divided into two parts, namely magnetic variation and magnetic deviation, the latter originating from magnetic properties of the vessel or aircraft. Variation and deviation are signed quantities. As discussed above, positive (easterly) &quot;variation&quot; indicates that magnetic north is east of geographic north. Likewise, positive (easterly) &quot;deviation&quot; indicates that the compass needle is east of magnetic north.

Compass, magnetic and true bearings are related by:

formula_1

The general equation relating compass and true bearings is

formula_2

Where:

* formula_3 is Compass bearing
* formula_4 is Magnetic bearing
* formula_5 is True bearing
* formula_6 is magnetic Variation
* formula_7 is compass Deviation
* formula_8 for westerly Variation and Deviation
* formula_9 for easterly Variation and Deviation
For example, if the compass reads 32°, the local magnetic variation is −5.5° (i.e. West) and the deviation is 0.5° (i.e. East), the true bearing will be:

formula_10

To calculate true bearing from compass bearing (and known deviation and variation):

*Compass bearing + deviation = magnetic bearing
*Magnetic bearing + variation = true bearing

To calculate compass bearing from true bearing (and known deviation and variation):

*True bearing - variation = Magnetic bearing 
*Magnetic bearing - deviation = Compass bearing

These rules are often combined with the mnemonic &quot;West is best, East is least&quot;; that is to say, add W declinations when going from True bearings to Magnetic bearings, and subtract E ones.

Another simple way to remember which way to apply the correction for continental USA is:
* For locations east of the agonic line (zero declination), roughly east of the Mississippi: the magnetic bearing is always bigger.
* For locations west of the agonic line (zero declination), roughly west of the Mississippi: the magnetic bearing is always smaller.

Common abbreviations are:
*TC = true course;
*V = variation (of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field);
*MC = magnetic course (what the course would be in the absence of local deviation);
*D = deviation caused by magnetic material (mostly iron and steel) on the vessel;
*CC = compass course.

===Deviation===
Magnetic deviation is the angle from a given magnetic bearing to the related bearing mark of the compass. Deviation is positive if a compass bearing mark (e.g., compass north) is right of the related magnetic bearing (e.g., magnetic north) and vice versa. For example, if the boat is aligned to magnetic north and the compass&#x27; north mark points 3° more east, deviation is +3°. Deviation varies for every compass in the same location and depends on such factors as the magnetic field of the vessel, wristwatches, etc. The value also varies depending on the orientation of the boat. Magnets and/or iron masses can correct for deviation, so that a particular compass accurately displays magnetic bearings. More commonly, however, a correction card lists errors for the compass, which can then be compensated for arithmetically. Deviation must be added to compass bearing to obtain magnetic bearing.

===Air navigation===
Air navigation is based on magnetic directions thus it is necessary to periodically revise navigational aids to reflect the drift in magnetic declination over time. This requirement applies to VOR beacons, runway numbering, airway labeling, and aircraft vectoring directions given by air traffic control, all of which are based on magnetic direction.

Runways are designated by a number between 01 and 36, which is generally one tenth of the magnetic azimuth of the runway&#x27;s heading: a runway numbered 09 points east (90°), runway 18 is south (180°), runway 27 points west (270°) and runway 36 points to the north (360° rather than 0°). However, due to magnetic declination, changes in runway designators have to occur at times to keep their designation in line with the runway&#x27;s magnetic heading. An exception is made for runways within the Northern Domestic Airspace of Canada; these are numbered relative to true north because proximity to the magnetic North Pole makes the magnetic declination large and changes in it happen at a high pace.

Radionavigation aids located on the ground, such as VORs, are also checked and updated to keep them aligned with magnetic north to allow pilots to use their magnetic compasses for accurate and reliable in-plane navigation.

For simplicity aviation sectional charts are drawn using true north so the entire chart need not be rotated as magnetic declination changes. Instead individual printed elements on the chart (such as VOR compass roses) are updated with each revision of the chart to reflect changes in magnetic declination. For an example refer to the sectional chart slightly west of Winston-Salem, North Carolina in March 2021, magnetic north is 8 degrees west of true north (Note the dashed line marked 8°W).

When plotting a course, some small aircraft pilots may plot a trip using true north on a sectional chart (map), then convert the true north bearings to magnetic north for in-plane navigation using the magnetic compass. These bearings are then converted on a pre-flight plan by adding or subtracting the local variation displayed on a sectional chart.

GPS systems used for aircraft navigation also display directions in terms of magnetic north even though their intrinsic coordinate system is based on true north. This is accomplished by means of lookup tables inside the GPS which account for magnetic declination. If flying under visual flight rules it is acceptable to fly with an outdated GPS declination database however if flying IFR the database must be updated every 28 days per FAA regulation.

As a fail-safe even the most advanced airliner will still have a magnetic compass in the cockpit. When onboard electronics fail, pilots can still rely on paper charts and the ancient and highly reliable device—the magnetic compass.

<text>Manus Island is part of Manus Province in northern Papua New Guinea and is the largest of the Admiralty Islands. It is the fifth-largest island in Papua New Guinea, with an area of , measuring around . Manus Island is covered in rugged jungles which can be broadly described as lowland tropical rain forest. The highest point on Manus Island is Mt. Dremsel, above sea level at the centre of the south coast. Manus Island is volcanic in origin and probably broke through the ocean&#x27;s surface in the late Miocene, 8 to 10 million years ago. The substrate of the island is either directly volcanic or from uplifted coral limestone.

Lorengau, the capital of Manus Province, is located on the island. Momote Airport, the terminal for Manus Province, is located on nearby Los Negros Island. A bridge connects Los Negros Island to Manus Island and the provincial capital of Lorengau. In the 2000 census, the whole Manus Province had a population of 50,321. The Austronesian Manus languages are spoken on the island.

Papua New Guinea allowed the government of Australia to run a controversial offshore immigration detention centre, the Manus Regional Processing Centre, which was situated on adjacent Los Negros Island from 2001 to 2017, to house asylum seekers arriving by boat found within Australia&#x27;s defined territorial borders.

Manus Island is home to the endemic emerald green snail, whose shells were harvested to be sold as jewellery; this continues, albeit at a lesser scale, as due to the snail&#x27;s status as a threatened species, its sale for this purpose is now illegal in many jurisdictions.

== History ==
The first recorded sighting of Manus Island by Europeans was by Spanish explorer Álvaro de Saavedra on board the carrack &quot;Florida&quot; on 15 August 1528, while trying to return to New Spain from the Maluku Islands. Saavedra circled Manus Island, and landed possibly on Murai islet to the south west. Murai was found to be inhabited and some natives came out in canoes, attacking with bows and arrows. Three of these men were captured by the Spaniards, and were returned by Saavedra to the same island, on his second attempt to return to North America the following year. Manus Island was charted as &quot;Urays la Grande&quot; or Big Urays, which is probably a projection of Murai to signify &quot;big Murai&quot;.

=== World War II ===
In World War II Manus Island was the site of an observation post manned by No. 4 Section, &#x27;B&#x27; Platoon, 1st Independent Company, Australian Imperial Force, who also provided medical treatment to the inhabitants. Manus was first bombed by the Japanese on 25 January 1942, the radio mast being the main target.

On 8 April 1942 an Imperial Japanese force consisting of the light cruiser &quot;Tatsuta&quot;, destroyer &quot;Mutsuki&quot; and a troop transport ship &quot;Mishima Maru&quot; entered Lorengau harbour and several hundred Japanese soldiers of the 8th Special Base Force invaded the island. The vastly outnumbered Australians withdrew into the jungle to fight a guerilla campaign. Later in 1942, Japan established a military base on Manus Island, using prisoners of war (notably Sikh prisoners of the 5th/11th Sikh regiment taken in the Fall of Singapore) as slave labor.

The island was attacked by United States forces in the Admiralty Islands campaign of February – March 1944. An Allied naval base was established at Seeadler Harbor, Manus Naval Base, on the island and it later supported the British Pacific Fleet. The ammunition ship exploded in Seeadler Harbor on 10 November 1944 with a heavy loss of life of US Navy personnel.

In 1950–51 the Australian government conducted the last trials against Japanese war criminals on the island. One case heard was that of Takuma Nishimura, who faced an Australian military court. He had already been tried by a British military court in relation to the Sook Ching massacre in Singapore and sentenced to life imprisonment. While on a stopover in Hong Kong he was intercepted by Australian military police. Evidence was presented stating that Nishimura had ordered the shootings of wounded Australian and Indian soldiers at Parit Sulong and the disposal of bodies to cover up the killings. In this trial he was found guilty and was hanged on 11 June 1951.

American anthropologist Margaret Mead lived on Manus Island before and after the war, and gave detailed accounts in &quot;Growing up in New Guinea&quot; and &quot;New Lives for Old&quot;.

== Detention centre ==
In addition to its resident population, asylum seekers have been located on Los Negros between 2001 and 2004 and since 2012.

Australia set up the Manus Regional Processing Centre on Manus Island in 2001 as part of its Pacific Solution immigration policy. In August 2012, the Australian Government controversially announced it would resume offshore processing; in November 2012 the relocation of asylum-seekers to Manus Island resumed.

On 26 April 2016, the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled that the detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island was illegal, and Prime Minister Peter O&#x27;Neill announced that the centre would be closed. After a stand-off involving PNG military and police, all remaining men were removed to new accommodation at the East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre, Hillside Haus and West Lorengau Haus by 23 November 2017.

In late 2019, the remaining asylum seekers were moved to Port Moresby, and upon request by the PNG government, the Australian Government terminated the contracts of the service providers for the detention centre and other facilities as of 30 November 2019.

==Naval bases==

On 20 September 2018, &quot;The Australian&quot; reported that Australia and Papua New Guinea were discussing providing port facilities to the Royal Australian Navy and US Navy on Manus Island. Australia and the United States would help expand Lombrum Naval Base, so there would be facilities for Australian naval vessels there. The newspaper reported that Australia was countering interest China had placed in expanding Papua New Guinea&#x27;s port facilities at Wewak, Kikori, Vanimo and Manus Island. Manus Island is the most important of these four ports, as it is a deep-water port near important shipping lanes. The RAN operated a naval base on Manus Island from the 1950s until transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in 1974.

== Interstellar meteor ==
In April 2022, the 2014 meteor called CNEOS 2014-01-08 was confirmed to have been the first known object from beyond the Solar System to have struck Earth. Some debris had reached the surface off the coast of Manus Island and may be recoverable.

<text>Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard (c. 1476 – 30 April 1524) was a French knight and military leader at the transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, generally known as the Chevalier de Bayard. Throughout the centuries since his death, he has been known as &quot;the knight without fear and beyond reproach&quot; (&quot;le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche&quot;). He himself preferred the name given him by his contemporaries for his gaiety and kindness, &quot;le bon chevalier&quot; (&quot;the good knight&quot;).

== Appearance and personality ==
In his portrait by Jacques de Mailles, his squire and biographer, Bayard appears as man with a sharp and pale face, with brown hair, a long nose and two attentive and bright eyes. According to a DNA study of Bayard&#x27;s skull, he had brown eyes, brownish hair and pale skin. Jacques writes that Bayard, small in stature as a child, grew considerably during adolescence; this is supported by modern studies of his skull which hypothesize that he had reached 1.8 meters (5 foot 11 inches), an above-average height for his time.

The French historian Aymar du Rivail described him as &quot;courteous, cheerful; not proud, indeed modest&quot;.

For the investiture as a knight that he received in battle, Bayard always felt deeply linked to the chivalric code of honor. Absolute loyalty even towards enemies, charity and help were his rules of life, in fact he did his utmost for the recovery of prostitutes and personally assisted the sick of the plague. While his fellow countrymen indulged in violence and raids, Bayard always remained respectful towards the weak and the vanquished, doing his utmost for their defense, and burned with furious anger in the face of all cruelty and injustice. He even used to pay out of his own pocket for the goods he requisitioned for the need for provisions, while his fellow countrymen used to simply snatch them from the peasants with violence.

Since he usually led the vanguard in the advances and passed to the rearguard in the retreats, he ordered his men to extinguish the fires that his colleagues had set in the villages, and placed sentinels in defense of the churches and monasteries to prevent the looting and rape of women who had taken refuge there.

Such was the fame of the magnanimity of Bayard that the people of Italy, who fled into the woods and mountains when armed men arrived, instead came running to meet his troops, loudly acclaiming his name and offering him gifts.

This did not prevent him from becoming a fierce and feared fighter in battle. He knew no mercy either towards his enemies or towards himself, and in this way he did not enter into contradiction with the vivid religious faith that he had nourished since childhood. God had wanted him to be a knight and he limited himself to fulfilling God&#x27;s will; he always placed himself in God&#x27;s hands immediately before every battle.

==Early life==
The descendant of a noble family with a military tradition – three generations of Terrail ancestors had fallen in battle successively from 1356 to 1465 –
Bayard was born at the Château Bayard, Dauphiné (near Pontcharra, Isère) in southern France. He served as a page to the young Duke Charles I of Savoy until March 1490, when the Duke died of an illness.

At age thirteen he came to the attention of King Charles VIII of France when he put on a remarkable display of horsemanship for the Duke of Savoy that earned him the nickname &quot;piquet&quot; (spur).

== 1490 – Service of King Charles VIII of France ==
=== 1490 – Man at arms of Louis de Luxembourg ===
In 1490 Bayard took service as a man-at-arms in the household of Louis de Luxembourg, the seigneur de Ligny (November 1490) and a favorite of King Charles VIII of France. As a youth, Bayard was distinguished by his looks, charming manner, and skill in the tiltyard.

On 20 July 1494 a tourney was held in Lyons, attended by the king and his court. Though not yet eighteen, Bayard won the highest honors, again coming to the attention of the king.

=== 1494 – Battle of Naples ===
In 1494 Bayard accompanied Charles VIII&#x27;s expedition into Italy to seize the Kingdom of Naples. This campaign is now known as the Italian War of 1494–1498.

=== 1495 – Battle of Fornovo ===
Bayard was knighted after the 1495 Battle of Fornovo, in which he captured a standard. Shortly afterward, entering Milan alone in pursuit of the enemy, he was taken prisoner, but was set free without a ransom by Ludovico Sforza.

=== Duel with Sotomayor ===
What first made Bayard truly famous in Italy, was an episode that took place in 1502, when a Gascon named Gaspar took prisoner Alonso de Sotomayor, a Spanish knight of gigantic stature and endowed with Herculean strength, while he was on his way to Rome. While Gaspar was waiting for the ransom due, Bayard took over the prisoner to prevent him from suffering ill-treatment, welcomed him into his home and treated him with all the respect and honor that he granted to his friends. However, the Spaniard, after gaining his freedom, accused Bayard of mistreating him and of having suffered terrible pains. As soon as he learned of this, the indignant Bayard challenged him to a duel to the death.

Bayard suffered at that time from serious attacks of malaria that weakened him physically and, as a sick person, he had the right to be represented by another. His friend Bellabre immediately volunteered in his place, but Bayard refused, saying he wanted to defend his own honor. On the day of the duel he had just recovered from the last attack of fever; after lying on the ground and having entrusted his soul to God, he went down to wait for his adversary. Sotomayor made him wait a long time in armor under the sun with the intent to tire him and weaken him further.

La Palice, worried about the delay, went to urge the Spaniard to present himself on the field. However, Sotomayor now placed a condition on the duel: as the challenged party, it was up to him to choose the weapons to be used. He declared that he wanted to fight on foot with a sword and a dagger. In this way, thanks to his build, he would have outreached his opponent. The request was disconcerting, as knights always clashed on horseback with lance and sword. He hoped that Bayard would be pushed by his friends to call off the duel. Instead, Bayard dismounted and the duel began.

Sotomayor initially feinted at Bayard, still trying to tire his opponent. Several times he repeated the same move: to raise the sword with two hands to lower it on the head of Bayard, who always dodged him. At the fourth time that the tactic was repeated, Bayard took advantage of the opportunity, threw himself forward and with the tip of the sword skewered from below the uncovered throat of the Spaniard, then finished him by planting the dagger in one eye. The French celebrated him exultantly with drums and piffari, but Bayard ordered them to be silent, since he did not want death to be celebrated. He went to a church where he began to pray on his knees for the soul of the dead.

=== 1502 – Battle of Canossa ===
In 1502 Bayard was wounded at Canossa.

=== 1503 – Battle of Garigliano ===
In the autumn of 1503, the French army moved towards Naples and in November reached the Garigliano river; there, sentinels sighted the Spanish troops commanded by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, a general who months earlier had inflicted a heavy defeat on the French near Cerignola. Because the river was in flood, the French threw a bridge of boats across it, covered by artillery fire that prevented the Spaniards from disturbing the operation. Having established the bridge, the French made camp, preferring to postpone the advance towards Naples to the following Spring. The army, too numerous to stay in the same camp, was divided and several battalions were dispersed in the surrounding villages. The Spaniards, taking advantage of the winter mists and the division of the French army, on 28 December, on the advice of Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano, threw another bridge of boats across the river and seized the unguarded and poorly defended camp. The rout that followed was catastrophic for the army of Louis XII: the sentinels noticed the attack too late and the commanders, caught off guard, did not have time to organize an effective defense and so turned to flight, pressed hard by Italian and Spanish cavalry.

Bayard, armed with sword and spear, then placed himself in the middle of the bridge, challenging alone about 300 or 400 Spaniards who, though numerous, could not even make him retreat. Around the knight rained arrows, spears, and spades, but he, dodging them, continued to repel all who climbed the bridge to face him, until his friend Bellabre rushed to pull him away from there to take him to safety. Bayard&#x27;s intervention made it possible to cover the retreat of the French army and gave them time to place the artillery to be ready to face the Spaniards and start the counterattack.

This feat, cloaked in legend, contributed significantly to his fame as a knight &quot;without spot and without fear&quot;, so much so that Pope Julius II himself tried in vain to secure his services.

Despite the value of Bayard, the French still had the worst on the Garigliano: their army was nearly annihilated; according to Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano, the main architect of the resounding Spanish victory, the army of Louis XII counted 1,500 spears, 3,400 cavalrymen, and 8,000 infantry that after the battle had been reduced to just 200 spears, 150 cavalrymen, and 600 infantry. These troops barricaded themselves in Gaeta, where a few days later they negotiated the surrender, but demanded that all prisoners be released and that transit to the north be ensured. Fernández de Córdoba agreed.

== 1508 – Service of King Louis XII of France ==
In 1508, Bayard accompanied King Louis XII against rebellious Genoa. In the battle that broke the back of the rebellion, Bayard played the role of champion and spearhead in the French assault, a breakneck cavalry charge up a mountain slope against a seemingly impregnable barricade defended by a pike-phalanx of Genoese militia. The Genoese broke and fled before the furious charge of Bayard and the French gendarmes. Genoa subsequently fell, and Bayard entered the city in triumph behind his king.

In June of that year, Louis XII played host to the Spanish king, Ferdinand. Weeks of festivities followed, including tourneys, banquets, and balls. Bayard was the champion of the first, and at the last became reacquainted with his former opponent at the Garigliano, Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, El Gran Capitán (&quot;The Great Captain&quot;) of Spain.

=== 1509 – Battle of Agnadello ===
In 1509, the League of Cambrai was formed between France, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and the Papacy in an effort to wrest from Venice its territorial empire in northeastern Italy.

For this campaign, the king commissioned Bayard to raise a company of horse and foot. Until that time, French infantry had been a despised rabble. Bayard&#x27;s company became a model of discipline, high morale, and battlefield effectiveness, and played a key role that year in rescuing the French vanguard at the Battle of Agnadello, on 14 May 1509 against the Venetian forces led by Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano.

=== 1509 – Siege of Padua ===
Later that year, Bayard was among the French forces under Jacques de La Palice sent to join their German ally, the Emperor Maximilian I at the Siege of Padua. Though the siege ultimately failed, what early success the allies enjoyed was largely due to Bayard&#x27;s combination of cool-headed leadership and dashing bravado.

Following the lifting of the siege by the Emperor, Bayard and a force of 300 men-at-arms retired into garrison at Verona. Bayard successfully carried out a series of raids and ambushes against Venetian forces in the vicinity, proving himself a master of &quot;small war&quot;, and adept at the leading of what today would be called &quot;special operations&quot;.

In 1510 the Duchy of Ferrara joined the alliance. Bayard was co-commander of the French contingent sent to garrison and aid the city and its Duke, Alfonso d&#x27;Este. During his eight-month stay, Bayard won the admiration of the duke and his wife, the lady Lucrezia Borgia. 
According to his biographer, &quot;The Loyal Servant&quot; (likely Bayard&#x27;s archer and lifelong secretary, Jacques de Mailles), Bayard fully reciprocated Lucrezia&#x27;s admiration, considering her &quot;a pearl&quot; among women. He returned to Ferrara on other occasions to pay homage to the lady, once in the company of Gaston de Foix, duc de Nemours, just months before the Battle of Ravenna, where the Duke lost his life.

=== 1511 – Holy League ===
By 1511 the League of Cambrai had collapsed due to papal fears of the growing power of France in Italy. To counter this, Pope Julius II declared the formation of the Holy League. This alliance put France at odds with not only the papacy but its erstwhile ally, the Holy Roman Empire, as well as Spain and ultimately the Swiss Confederation.

In various skirmishes with papal troops around Ferrara, Bayard continued to win renown. In one instance, he very nearly captured the Pope himself. About this time, the Duke Alphonso and Bayard found themselves under papal interdict. How long Bayard&#x27;s period of excommunication lasted is unclear.

=== 1512 – Siege of Brescia ===
At the Siege of Brescia in 1512, Bayard led a wedge of dismounted men-at-arms against the defenders, himself at its tip. Several times the French assault was thrown back. Each time Bayard rallied the French forces and led them in renewed attacks. His boldness at last resulted in a severe wound to the thigh, but not before the defenses were breached and the French entered the town.

The soldiers carried Bayard into a neighbouring mansion, the residence of a nobleman, whose wife and daughters he protected from threatened insult. Bayard was charmed by the young daughters, who sang to him nightly. Before his wound was healed, he learned that battle was imminent at Ravenna, and he hurried to depart to rejoin his comrades. He endowed the two daughters with a thousand gold ducats each, the money the lady of the house had paid him as ransom for her family.

=== 1512 – Battle of Ravenna ===
Bayard joined his commander and friend, Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, in time for the fateful Battle of Ravenna (1512). Bayard&#x27;s gallantry and the French cavalry under de Foix carried the day, but the duke was killed in the final hour, rendering the battle a strategic loss for the French and a personal tragedy for Bayard.

=== 1512 – Battle of Pamplona ===
Bayard was sent to Navarre with La Palice to support John III of Navarre and his co-monarch Catherine, who wanted to recover their kingdom, which had been conquered by the King of Spain Fernando II of Aragon. Bayard took part in the capture of the castle of Tiebas and the failed assault on Pamplona (27 November 1512.)

=== 1513 – Battle of the Spurs ===
In 1513, when Henry VIII of England routed the French at the Battle of the Spurs (Guinegate, where Bayard&#x27;s father had received a lifelong injury in a battle of 1479), Bayard, trying to rally his countrymen, found his escape cut off. Unwilling to surrender, he rode suddenly up to an English officer who was resting unarmed, and summoned him to yield; the knight complying, Bayard in turn gave himself up to his prisoner. He was taken into the English camp, but his gallantry impressed Henry as it had Ludovico, and the king released him without ransom, merely exacting his word not to serve for six weeks.

== 1515 – Service of King Francis I of France and death ==

On the accession of Francis I in 1515, Bayard was made lieutenant-general of Dauphiné, but soon accompanied the King and army into the territory of Milan, control of which was challenged by the Swiss. At the Battle of Marignano the opposing armies engaged in a protracted and bloody struggle which the French won largely because of the valour of Bayard, King Francis, and the French gendarmes (armored lancers). After the battle, Bayard had the honour of conferring knighthood on his youthful sovereign.

=== 1521 – Siege of Mézières ===
When war again broke out between Francis I and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Bayard, with 1000 men, held Mézières, which had been declared untenable, against an army of 35,000, and after six weeks compelled the imperial generals to raise the siege. This stubborn resistance saved central France from invasion, as the king did not have sufficient forces to withstand the Holy Roman Empire.

All France celebrated the achievement, and Francis gained time to collect the royal army, which drove out the invaders in 1521. The &quot;parlement&quot; thanked Bayard as the saviour of his country; the king made him a knight of the Order of Saint Michael and commander in his own name of 100 &quot;gens d&#x27;armes&quot;, an honour until then reserved for princes of the blood.

=== 1524 – Death in Italy ===

After allaying a revolt at Genoa, and striving with the greatest assiduity to check a pestilence in Dauphiné, Bayard was sent into Italy with Admiral Bonnivet, who, being defeated at Robecco and wounded in a combat during his retreat, implored Bayard to assume command and save the army. He repulsed the foremost pursuers, but in guarding the rear at the passage of the river Sesia between the towns of Romagnano Sesia and Gattinara, was mortally wounded by an arquebus ball on 30 April 1524.

He died in the midst of the enemy, attended by Pescara, the Spanish commander, and by his old comrade, Charles, duc de Bourbon, who was now fighting on the opposite side. Charles is reported to have said &quot;Ah! Monsieur de Bayard... I am very sad to see you in this state; you who were such a virtuous knight!&quot; Bayard answered,

His body was restored to his friends and interred at Saint-Martin-d&#x27;Hères. In 1822 his remains were buried in the Collegiate Church of Saint-André, Grenoble.

== Personal life ==
Jacques de Maille reports that for many years – one can say throughout his life, if one excludes his first youthful platonic love – Bayard loved a woman whose identity he never revealed. Bayard&#x27;s only child was born in Cantù, in 1501: Jeanne Terrail. Since he could not take care of her, engaged as he was in campaigning, Bayard had her raised in France by his sister Jeanne, a nun in the . Since Terrail is never referred to as a &quot;bastard&quot; but always as a &quot;daughter&quot; and since Bayard would refuse in the future the marriage proposed to him by Queen Anne, it is believed that he had married the girl&#x27;s mother. Various hypotheses have been made about the identity of the mother: numerous clues lead to Bianca di Monferrato, the Duchess of Savoy, who was widowed when very young. This is supported by Bayard&#x27;s presence at that time in Piedmont and his statement that the child was noble and the daughter of a lady of great house. The hypothesis is strongly supported by Paul Ballaguy, while Camille Monnet categorically rejects it.

==Bayard&#x27;s DNA==
A 2017 research paper by Gérard Lucotte verified that Bayard&#x27;s mtDNA haplogroup was H10E and his YDNA haplogroup was R1b-M269.

==Legacy==
As a soldier, Bayard was considered the epitome of chivalry and one of the most skillful commanders of the age. He was noted for the exactitude and completeness of his information on the enemy&#x27;s movements, which he obtained by careful reconnaissance and a well-arranged system of espionage.

In the midst of mercenary armies, Bayard remained absolutely disinterested, and to his contemporaries and his successors, he was, with his romantic heroism, piety, and magnanimity, the fearless and faultless knight (&quot;le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche&quot;). His gaiety and kindness even more frequently won him another name bestowed by his contemporaries, &quot;le bon chevalier&quot;.

<text>Thomas Alsgaard (born 10 January 1972) is a Norwegian former professional cross-country skier. Alsgaard is regarded by many as the best performer of the freestyle technique (skating) in cross-country skiing and many of today&#x27;s best skiers have studied his technique. In total, Alsgaard won 15 medals in the Winter Olympics and FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, making him one of the most successful skiers of all time.

==Early life==
Born in Flateby, Enebakk, Alsgaard began cross-country ski racing at the age of three. That was when he was entered into a race against many 5-year-olds. He beat all of them. A year later, it was rumored that he was lost in the village the family lived in. In fact, he was found at the local ski area, just about to start his third time around a 9-kilometer loop. Alsgaard says that his passion for skiing comes from liking to be outdoors.

==Athletic career==
Alsgaard got his international breakthrough in the Lillehammer 1994 Winter Olympics winning the 30 kilometre freestyle event. In total, Alsgaard won 15 medals in the Winter Olympics and FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, making him one of the most successful skiers of all time. Excluding his World Championships debut in 1993, Alsgaard won at least one gold medal at every Olympic Games and World Championships that he participated from 1994 to 2003. Alsgaard retired from racing after the 2003 World Championships.

He won the Holmenkollen medal in 2001 (shared with Adam Małysz and Bente Skari).

==After his career as a professional skier==
Alsgaard retired from racing in 2003. Between 2013 and 2017 he was the owner and manager of a ski team, Team LeasePlan.

He now works as a technical advisor for Alpina Sports, working in the Nordic boot department.

He is also known as a sports commentator for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation.

In the Norwegian Championship in January 2011, Alsgaard took a sensational bronze medal at the 15 km classical individual race, defeating many skiers on the Norwegian World Cup team. He was only beaten by Eldar Rønning (gold) and Martin Johnsrud Sundby (silver). He repeated the feat in 2012, expressing frustration with the lack of aggressiveness and initiative in both the younger elite athletes and the team surrounding them.

==Ski Classics team owner==
As of December 2016 the team consists of four &quot;allround&quot; skiers and six skiers with &quot;langløp&quot; (or long races) as their specialty; Swede Lina Korsgren is the team&#x27;s only female (as of 2016); Hans Kristian Stadheim assists in coaching. On 21 April 2017, Alsgaard announced that Team LeasePlan had to shut down due to sponsorship problems.

<doc id="308076" wikidata="Q466595" url="?curid=308076" title="Edith Södergran">
<text>Edith Irene Södergran (4 April 1892 – 24 June 1923) was a Swedish-speaking Finnish poet. One of the first modernists within Swedish-language literature, her influences came from French Symbolism, German expressionism, and Russian futurism. At the age of 24 she released her first collection of poetry entitled &quot;Dikter&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;). Södergran died at the age of 31, having contracted tuberculosis as a teenager. She did not live to experience the worldwide appreciation of her poetry, which has influenced many lyrical poets. Södergran is considered to have been one of the greatest modern Swedish-language poets, and her work continues to influence Swedish-language poetry and musical lyrics, for example, in the works of Mare Kandre, Gunnar Harding, Eva Runefelt, Heidi Sundblad-Halme, and Eva Dahlgren.

==Childhood==
Edith Irene Södergran was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, into a middle-class Swedish speaking family. Her father, Mats Södergran hailed from Ostrobothnia while her mother, Helena Södergran, née Holmroos, was born and raised in Saint Petersburg. Edith grew up as an only child. Her mother had earlier become pregnant by a Russian soldier and given birth to an illegitimate son, but the child died after only two days. Her father had been a widower after the death of his wife and two small children. The sorrow united her parents, who were also both considered less suitable in marriage due to their past.

Edith&#x27;s mother came from a well-positioned family, and the status of women within the family is thought to have been strong. It is apparent that Edith and her mother shared a strong bond. Considerably less is known about her relationship to her father, who died when Edith was only 15.

When Edith was just a few months old, the Södergrans moved to the village of Raivola on the Karelian Isthmus where her grandfather, Gabriel Holmroos, bought a house for them. A short time afterward, Mats acquired a job as a superintendent at a sawmill. Three years later, the company went into bankruptcy, and the family struggled to make ends meet. Helena&#x27;s father died a few months later, and the inheritance was shared between her and her mother. With the money from the inheritance, Helena was able to pay the family&#x27;s debts and get them back on their feet. The rest of the money disappeared quickly, however, due to Mats&#x27; unsuccessful businesses. Helena managed to arrange for the family to receive a part of the proceeds from her mother&#x27;s share of the inheritance, making the family debt-free once more.

Edith attended the girls school at Petrischule in St. Petersburg. Petrischule was rich in tradition and created an interesting and highly intellectual surrounding for Edith. The school was situated opposite The Winter Palace, which enabled Edith to experience the troubles in Tsarist Russia at close range. She was almost certainly in the city on Bloody Sunday in January 1905 when the Tsarist guards opened fire on thousands of starving citizens who had gathered to protest the lack of food.

In 1904, her father was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and in May 1906 he was admitted to Nummela sanatorium in Nyland. He was later sent home, incurably ill. Mats Södergran died in October 1907, only a year before Edith would herself be diagnosed with the disease.

Under these complicated circumstances, Edith&#x27;s mother was responsible for the well-being of the family, especially as Mats Södergran&#x27;s health deteriorated. This is believed to have been an early influence on Edith&#x27;s belief in women and feminism. Though her first real encounter with a more structured questioning of the gender dynamics and the &#x27;new woman&#x27; is believed to have taken place during her time in a sanatorium in Switzerland.

Edith was a keen photographer, and there are many pictures of her mother, albeit few of her father. Helena Södergran was a robust, petite and intelligent woman with a broad and captivating smile. Helena may have seemed stable, but was often nervous, shaken and restless. Edith enjoyed a close bond with her mother, and Helena supported her daughter&#x27;s wish to become a poet. Edith and her mother spent a lot more time together than Edith and her father. Edith and Helena would move into St. Petersburg during the school terms, living in the Wiborgska part of the city. Edith&#x27;s father only lived with them in the city for short periods of time.

Edith had made a few friends, but Helena feared her daughter might be lonely. Some biographers, including Gunnar Tideström, have claimed that Helena had found a foster sister of a similar age to Edith, named Singa. Singa is believed to have lived with the Södergrans during school terms, but moved back to her biological family during the holidays. On one visit, Singa supposedly ran away back to her biological family, but while walking along the train tracks she was run over by a train, and Helena later found the mutilated body. However, other biographers, such as Ebba Witt-Brattström, have disputed the story of Singa, claiming there is no real evidence she ever existed.

==School days==
In 1902, Edith began her schooling in &quot;Die deutsche Hauptschule zu St. Petri&quot; () where she studied until 1909. These school years were characterized by worries and strong social tensions which likely affected her worldview. Amongst the poems in &quot;Vaxdukshäftet&quot; that depict Edith&#x27;s school years, there are poems with political themes. At school there were pupils of many different nationalities, including German, Russian, Finnish and Scandinavian. Her studies focused on modern languages, and she learned German, French, English and Russian; however, she received no instruction in her mother tongue of Swedish, and her knowledge of Swedish grammar and spelling was somewhat faltering. German was the language she spoke most both in school and with her friends. It was in German that she wrote her first poems. She improved her German during her stay in Davos, Switzerland as a patient during 1912-1913 and from 1913 to 1914 for the second time.

Edith was an intelligent pupil with the ability to assimilate knowledge quickly, needing to spend little time revising. One of her classmates described her as the class&#x27; most gifted pupil. More and more she became interested in the French lessons she received. To a certain extent, this was due to her teacher, Henri Cottier, to whom she directed a large proportion of the love poems that appear in &quot;Vaxdukshäftet&quot;.

During 1908, Edith appears to have made a decision to make Swedish the main language of her writings and her poems in German suddenly stopped. This was not a self-evident decision. She had no close contact with Swedish literature, and Finland-Swedish poetry was in a depression. An important impulse to the decision might have come from one of her relatives, the Finland-Swedish language researcher Hugo Bergroth. Some years earlier she had published a poem, &quot;Hoppet&quot; (&quot;The Hope&quot;), in a membership newsletter for the Swedish Liberal Party in Helsingfors and began to come into contact with Finland-Swedish authors. The transition to Swedish seemed also to mark a clear decision to focus on poetry.

==Illness==
One day in November 1908, Edith came home from school saying that she was restless and that she did not feel well. Helena called for a doctor, who diagnosed that Edith had an inflammation of the lungs. According to the mother, the girl understood what it was as she asked several times if she had got &quot;lung soot&quot;. Edith had guessed correctly. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1909, it was established and Edith tested positive for tuberculosis. Barely a month after the result, she was admitted to Nummela sanatorium, the same hospital where her father had been a patient before he passed on, meaning that Edith was never entirely comfortable there. At the time, the chances of recovering entirely from tuberculosis were not especially good. 70–80% of cases died within ten years of diagnosis.

Edith was unhappy at Nummela. The place was altogether too strongly associated with her father&#x27;s death. She lost weight, her mood was low, and she was described afterwards as unkempt and &quot;strange&quot;. She was even thought to have a mild mental illness after she proposed to one of the doctors. It is apparent that she did not get on well at Nummela and felt that the place resembled more closely a prison. During the long days, Edith daydreamed of other lands and exotic places. She willingly shared her dreams, which made her seem even more peculiar. During the following year, her condition worsened, and the family looked for help abroad. The obvious choice was Switzerland, which was at the time the centre for tuberculosis treatment within Europe.

At the beginning of October 1911, roughly three years after the start of her illness, Edith and her mother travelled to Arosa in Switzerland, but even there she did not get on especially well. She was examined by three different doctors who all came up with entirely different solutions to her illness. Some months later, she was transported to Dr Ludwig von Muralt at the Davos-Dorf sanatorium. Edith immediately took a liking to her new doctor and got on much better there. Dr von Muralt suggested that a so-called left-sided pneumothorax should be performed. This involved puncturing the lung during an operation and filling it with nitrogen gas. The punctured lung would be unusable but it would be &quot;rested&quot;. After May 1912 no more tuberculosis bacteria were shown to be in her lungs although she was not free from the sickness and knew that she must be watchful of her diet and rest for several hours every day.

Her time in Switzerland played a large role in Edith&#x27;s international orientation. From a remote part of Finland she had arrived in an intellectually vital country where, not least at the sanatorium, she met many gifted people from the whole of Europe. With them she felt a connection that she had rarely felt in St. Petersburg. Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel The Magic Mountain, which admittedly was written after the war but is set in a sanatorium during these years, gives a picture of the intellectually lively atmosphere. Her doctor, von Muralt, appears also to be one of the first doctors who truly won her trust and friendship. When he died in 1917, Edith wrote two poems, &quot;Trädet i skogen&quot; (&quot;The Tree in the Forest&quot;) and &quot;Fragment av en stämning&quot; (&quot;Fragment of a Mood&quot;), which expresses her sorrow and conflicted memories of her time in Switzerland.

Finally, Edith felt better, her cough had disappeared, and she was perkier than normal. In the spring of 1914 she finally travelled home, but the sickness shadowed her and her poetry faced a struggle against illness and, later, fatigue.

==Literary revolt==
Her debut book &quot;Dikter&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;), which came out in the autumn of 1916, gained no great notice, even if a few critics were slightly perplexed – Södergran was already using associative free verse and describing selected details instead of entire landscapes. Expression of a young, modern, female consciousness in poems like &quot;Dagen svalnar...&quot; (&quot;The Day Cools...&quot;) and &quot;Vierge moderne&quot; (&quot;Modern Lady&quot;) was entirely new within Swedish language poetry.

After the October Revolution in 1917, Edith and her mother&#x27;s economic assets were suddenly rendered worthless since they had been placed in Ukrainian securities; and soon after, from the spring of 1918, the Karelian Isthmus became a war zone. In Petrograd (as St. Petersburg was called from 1914), people were being shot without trial, and Södergran knew that several of her classmates had fled from the city. She read Friedrich Nietzsche and found in him the courage to keep upright against a periodically shifting and degrading life.

Her new poetic direction with &quot;Septemberlyran&quot; (&quot;The September Lyre&quot;) met no greater understanding from the public and from critics. She tried to discuss her poetry in a notorious letter to the editor in the Helsinki newspaper &quot;Dagens Press&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1918 in order to clear up some of her intentions with the paradoxical visions in her new book. She succeeded instead in provoking the first debate about modernism&#x27;s incomprehensible poetry in the Swedish language – a debate which would later return regarding Birger Sjöberg, Peter Weiss and Erik Lindegren. The newspaper debate in Södergran&#x27;s case was harsh – none of the debaters seemed either to have had any sense of the conditions under which the poems had been written: hunger, tuberculosis, the threat of being exiled or killed if Raivola was taken by the Red Guard – but she won a friend and lifelong ally in the young critic Hagar Olsson (1893–1978).

Olsson became a first breach in her isolated and threatened existence in the distant village – she made a number of visits, and the two women remained in contact by letter until a few weeks before Södergran&#x27;s death, when Olsson went on a tour to France without an inkling that she was to lose one of her best friends. She was to grow into one of the most powerful modernist critics in Finland, and at times she has been seen as almost a posthumous spokeswoman and interpreter of Södergran, not least because so few others had been in continuous and close long-term contact with the poet and were still alive and willing to speak in public when Södergran became an established classic. It was a position with which Olsson was, by her own admission, uncomfortable, but her accounts of Södergran and her edition of the author&#x27;s letters to her, with Olsson&#x27;s own evocative commentary (her own letters were lost after Södergran&#x27;s death), have had an incalculable effect on the later image of her friend.

In the next book, &quot;Rosenaltaret&quot; (&quot;The Rose Altar&quot;), printed in June 1919, a cycle of poems, &quot;Fantastique&quot; celebrates the sister, a being who seems to hover between reality and fantasy in some of the poems while some of the details are quite close to subjects that had been discussed in the letters of the two. The poem &quot;Systern&quot; (&quot;The Sister&quot;) is silently dedicated to Olsson, and contains the line &quot;She got lost to me in the throng of the city&quot; which, as biographer Gunnar Tideström has put it, corresponds to Södergran&#x27;s dismay after the too-short visits by Hagar Olsson and her return to Helsingfors. Olsson has later recalled Södergran&#x27;s lyrical, funny, warm, and sometimes frightening and imposing personality. Both of them have sometimes been seen as bisexuals, and the question of whether there was a lesbian element in the emotional bond between them remains a disputed one.

With the next collection of poems, &quot;Framtidens skugga&quot; (&quot;The Shadow of the Future&quot;) (whose original title was &quot;Köttets mysterier&quot; (&quot;Mysteries of the Flesh&quot;)), the visions that had exhorted Södergran culminate in poems speaking of a renewed world after the wars and catastrophes that now ravage the Earth – Raivola was, as stated earlier, a war zone in 1918, and even later Edith was able to hear gunfire from her kitchen window. The wording can lead one to think both of Walt Whitman and Jim Morrison when the poet takes on the role of fortune teller, general, or quite simply that of Eros&#x27; chosen intermediary, as in the poem &quot;Eros hemlighet&quot; (&quot;Eros&#x27; secret&quot;).

Despite the visionary overtones, Södergran was during this period an atheist, and according to neighbours and friends she was entirely capable of differentiating between her own self and the shimmering queens and prophets she took as characters in her poetry. The change imagined in her writing would create a new humanity, led by &quot;the strongest spirits&quot; (Nietzsche&#x27;s Übermenschen); see, for example, the poems &quot;Botgörarne&quot; (&quot;The Atoners&quot;) and &quot;Först vill jag bestiga Chimborazzo&quot; (&quot;First I shall ascend Chimborazzo in my own land&quot;). Generally, when she gave space for a more positive belief in nature and religious spirituality in her poems, it meant that she felt a release from some of the specific expectations that had upheld her in a dreary existence – a waiting and &quot;charging-up&quot; that could not be endured indefinitely – but also an incipient repudiation of, and retreat from, her Nietzschean vision of the future.

From the summer of 1920 on, she abandoned her poetry until August 1922; during the autumn and winter she wrote her final poems, stimulated by the review &quot;Ultra&quot;; the short-lived review, started by Elmer Diktonius, Hagar Olsson and other young writers, was the first publication in Finland to embrace literary modernism, and it hailed Edith as a pioneering genius and printed her new poems. Left behind were the expectations of a leading role for herself but not the daring descriptive language, and some of these final poems have come to be her most-loved.

Edith died on Midsummer Day 1923 at her home in Raivola, and was buried at the village church. Her mother continued to live in the village until 1939 and died during the evacuation that occurred due to the winter war. Following The Moscow Peace Treaty in 1940, the village became Soviet territory and to this day belongs to Russia (the area has become urbanized since 1950 and most visible traces of the village that existed in Södergran&#x27;s day are now long gone). The site of Edith&#x27;s grave is today unknown; however, in 1960 a statue to her was erected in Raivola. Shortly after the war, Raivola was renamed Roschino (Russian: Рощино). Of her former home, only the ground stones remain. They are situated behind the Orthodox church, which after the Fall of the Soviet Union was rebuilt in the same place using photographs of her house as a guide.

==Work and aesthetic position==
Edith Södergran was a trailblazer within modernist Swedish poetry and had many followers, including, amongst others, Elmer Diktonius (1896–1961), Gunnar Björling (1887–1960) and Rabbe Enckell (1903–74). In Sweden she became an important guide for a number of poets, including Gunnar Ekelöf and Karin Boye, and her poems are now translated into Russian, Spanish, Chinese and other languages.

It took many years for her to gain recognition. Fourteen years after Södergran&#x27;s death, the author Jarl Hemmer said that her poetry surely had meaning but did not believe that it would be appreciated by people in general.

She was often fascinated by expressionism but later broadened her lyrical expression. She has come to be called a modernist, despite being considered, along with Elmer Diktonius and Rabbe Enckell and others, for the most part distinct.

Of her poems, some of the most well-known are &quot;Svart eller vitt&quot; (&quot;Black or White&quot;), &quot;Ingenting&quot; (&quot;Nothing&quot;), &quot;Min barndoms träd&quot; (&quot;My Childhood&#x27;s Trees&quot;) and &quot;Landet som icke är&quot; (&quot;The Land which is not&quot;). Her most quoted poem is probably &quot;Dagen svalnar...&quot; (&quot;The Day Cools...&quot;), which deals with feelings such as longing, fear, closeness and distance.

Södergran&#x27;s poetic authority and her sense of herself were clearly liberated by her reading of Nietzsche and her acceptance of the concept of the superman. In her middle-period poems, we often meet a commanding figure – a prophet, a princess, a saint, or simply an imposing &quot;I&quot; projecting their will, visions and feelings. This kind of assertiveness, particularly coming from a woman writer, has been an obstacle to some reading her work and a highly attractive and convincing element to others. But Södergran herself was enough of a realist to know that these personae are not simply to be conflated with her own private self – she obliquely refers to that distinction several times in her letters to Hagar Olsson, and many people who knew her have attested that she was aware of it – so the ego in her production can be a role that she will visit and investigate, as in the poems &quot;Rosenaltaret&quot; (&quot;The Rose Altar&quot;), &quot;Stormen&quot; (&quot;The Storm&quot;) (there are two poems with this title, both of them with a visionary slant), &quot;Skaparegestalter&quot; (&quot;Creator Figures&quot;), &quot;Vad är mitt hemland&quot; (&quot;What Is My Homeland?&quot;), and many others. In &quot;Den stora trädgården&quot; (&quot;The Big Garden), a beautiful 1920 poem about the mission of artists and the new age, she states openly that &quot;Naked we walk in shredded clothes ...&quot; and that artists have no outward power and should not aim to have any:

:If I had a big garden
:I would invite all my brothers and sisters there.
:Each one would bring a large treasure.
:We own nothing, thus we could become one people.
:We shall build bars around our garden
:letting no sound from the world reach us.
:Out of our silent garden
:we shall bring the world a new life.

The poem was originally sent to Hagar Olsson in an April 1920 letter where Edith recounts flu, abject poverty, and a humiliating attempt to sell some old underwear to get money. Gunnar Tideström has commented that &quot;few documents of her hand give such a striking idea of her day-to-day self&quot;, and that &quot;she admits that life is cruel and that she will perish if this goes on for much longer – but it is not a self-pitying letter; it glows with light&quot;.

==Bibliography==
Södergran released four volumes of poetry during her short lifetime. After her death, &quot;Landet som icke är&quot; (&quot;The Land which Is Not&quot;) was released, containing a collection of poems that had been rejected from her earlier volumes.

&quot;Vaxdukshäftet&quot; (written 1907–09), from her teenage years in St. Petersburg and Raivola, was released in Finland in 1961 by Olof Enckell (with the title &quot;Ungdomsdikter 1907–1909&quot; (Childhood poems 1907–1909). These had been previously analyzed by several researchers, including Gunnar Tideström and Ernst Brunner, and by Enckell himself. The manuscript, like many of Södergran&#x27;s original manuscripts, is in an archive in Finland.

&quot;Junge Schwedischsprachige lyrik in Finnland&quot; is an anthology that Södergran also worked on during 1921–22 and which she hoped to have published in Germany in order to be able to launch young Swedish language Finnish poetry there. She undertook the task of translating a portion of her own poetry, similar to Diktonius and a number of other poets from the previous generation. A German publishing house declined in the end to publish – not entirely unexpected since this was just as hyper inflation and instability were at their height in Germany – and the manuscript disappeared.

&quot;Samlade dikter&quot; (&quot;Collected Poems&quot;) was released in 1949 in Helsinki; it contained everything that had previously come out in book form, plus some of Södergran&#x27;s unpublished poems, of which a dozen would not be printed again until fifty years later.

The seven original collections are available in electronic form from Project Runeberg (see external link below).

<doc id="308077" wikidata="Q968929" url="?curid=308077" title="Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet">
<text>Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet (c. 1488 – 24 February 1525) was a French soldier.

The younger brother of Artus Gouffier, seigneur de Boisy, tutor of Francis I of France, Bonnivet was brought up with Francis, and after the young king&#x27;s accession he became one of the most powerful of the royal favourites. On 31 December 1517 he was made Admiral of France, in charge of all maritime affairs from which he received substantial revenues, including portions of the gains from wrecks and prizes. In the imperial election of 1519 he superintended the candidature of Francis, and spent vast sums of money in his efforts to secure votes, but without success. An implacable enemy of the Constable de Bourbon, he contributed to the downfall of the latter. In command of the army of Navarre in 1521, he occupied Fuenterrabia and was probably responsible for the renewal of hostilities resulting from its not being restored.
Bonnivet succeeded Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec, in 1523, as commander of the army of Italy and entered the Milanese, but was defeated and forced to effect a disastrous retreat, in which the chevalier Bayard perished. He was afterwards one of the principal commanders of the army which Francis led into Italy at the end of 1524, and died at the Battle of Pavia.

Brantôme says that the Battle of Pavia was fought at Bonnivet&#x27;s instigation, and that, seeing the disaster he had caused, he deliberately sought a heroic death. In spite of his failures as a general and diplomat, his good looks and brilliant wit enabled him to retain the intimacy and confidence of his king. He followed a licentious lifestyle. According to Brantôme, he was the successful rival of the king for the favours of Madame de Châteaubriant, and if, as is thought, he was the hero of the fourth story of the &quot;Heptaméron&quot;, Marguerite, future Queen of Navarre, was also courted by him.

Bonnivet&#x27;s correspondence is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris and in The National Archives (United Kingdom); the complete works of Brantôme, vol. iii., are another primary source.

<text>Nakhon Phanom province (, , ; , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) lies in upper northeastern Thailand also called Isan. Directly adjacent provinces are (from south clockwise): Mukdahan, Sakon Nakhon, and Bueng Kan. To the northeast it borders Khammouan of Laos.

==Geography==
The province, in the Mekong River valley, is mostly plains. The northern part of the province has a more upland, forest-covered character. The main river in the northern part is the Songkhram River with the smaller Oun River. The southern part is flatter with the Kum River as its only notable watercourse. The provincial capital, the city of Nakhon Phanom, is on the banks of the Mekong. The total forest area is or 14 percent of provincial area.

===National parks===
There are two national parks, along with five other national parks, make up region 10 (Udon Thani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Phu Pha Yon National Park, 
* Phu Langka National Park, and includes the Tat Kham and Tat Pho waterfalls as its most popular attractions. Flowers such as the Lady Slipper Orchid and diverse wildlife are found in the park.

==History==
The name Nakhon Phanom, meaning &#x27;city of mountains&#x27;, was given to the city by King Rama I. There are no mountains within Nakhon Phanom itself, the limestone mountains being concentrated in the city of Thakhek in Laos on the other side of the Mekong River. Nakhon Phanom is more accurately described as a city where mountains can be seen.

During the 12th century, the area was a kingdom called the Kingdom of Sikhottaboon, but the kingdom went into decline and fell under Khmer rule in the 1500s. In 1766, the city of Marukhanakhon was moved across the Mekong river to its present site on the Thai side. The town was again moved to its present site and was called &quot;Nakhon Buri Ratchathani&quot; until renamed by King Rama I to its present name.

The area had been long settled by Lao people and belonged to the Lan Xang Kingdom. After it came under the control of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, the population remained predominantly Lao speaking. At first it was known as &quot;Si Khottrabun&quot;, and during the reign of King Rama I was called &quot;Marukkhanakhon&quot;.

During the Vietnam War Nakhon Phanom saw fighting between North Vietnamese insurgents and US forces. During the 1960s, 73 of the 131 sub-district (&quot;tambons&quot;) were allegedly infiltrated by the Vietnamese and Lao communists, and the province was known as the &quot;heartland of insurgency&quot;. US and Thai forces established a base at Nakhon Phanom, where the Thai military hosted the 56th Air Commando Wing, which conducted special operations against both the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos and carried out counter-insurgency operations against Thai communist forces while conducting search and rescue operations primarily inside Laos and North Vietnam.

On 7 August 1965, an ethnic Phu Thai village in the province, made headlines when Thailand&#x27;s first-ever physical confrontation between communist fighters and Thai security forces occurred. Eight communist villagers were involved, one of whom was shot dead during the incident after the town was surrounded by state forces.

Between 1967 and 1971, most of the communist insurgents were defeated. Towards the end of the Vietnam War, US forces moved their Indochinese military operations to Nakhon Phanom.

Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh had resided from 1928 and 1931 in Ban Nachok, a small village on the road between what is now the airbase and Nakhon Phanom. His former home and a museum are open to the public.

In 2023, a Lao 56-year-old man named Thao Bua Pa was arrested in a major bust for having 1,012,000 tablets of methamphetamine pills. He claimed he had lost his employment and was going to save the money he made to look after his pregnant wife.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the pagoda of Phra That Phanom in That Phanom District. Originally constructed around 535 BCE in Khmer-style, it collapsed in 1675 and was rebuilt in Lao-style. The provincial tree, as well as flower, is &quot;Fagraea fragrans&quot;. The provincial aquatic life is basa fish (&quot;Pangasius bocourti&quot;) (known as &quot;pla yang&quot; or &quot;pla poh&quot; in Thai).

The provincial slogan is &quot;The city of the revered Phrathat Phanom, cultural diversity, beautiful Phutai people, brilliant illuminated boat procession and picturesque Mekong River&quot;.

==Culture==
Important festivals in the province include the traditional dances of the Phu Thai ethnic group held in May and June every year. The Phra That Phanom temple fair is held every February, when many locals visit the temple to pay homage. At the end of the Buddhist Lent in October or November, an illuminated boat procession takes place. The event is locally known as &quot;Lai ruea fai&quot; (ไหลเรือไฟ), &quot;floating a fire boat&quot;.

In late year, Si Songkhram District, the largest fish trading centre of the Mekong and Songkhram River Basin in Isan, holds a Fish Festival, featuring a parade of giant robots of various fish species found in the Mekong Basin. These robots are made from local materials based on local wisdom. The robots are long and – high. This festival is held to show the richness of local aquatic resources and to raise awareness of the conservation of nature and fish species.

The cuisine is similar to that of Laos as the Lao make up the ethnic and cultural majority through centuries of Laotian rule. Padaek or Pla ra, fermented, preserved fish, originally comes from the Si Songkhram area is now popular throughout Thailand.

Traditional products in the province include hand-woven fabric, made from silk or cotton. Renu Nakhon, That Phanom, and Si Songkhram Districts are the centers of this industry. Also hand-made khene instruments are made in the province.
