<text>was a prominent &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord) in the western Chūgoku region of Japan during the Sengoku period of the 16th century. The Mōri clan claimed descent from Ōe no Hiromoto (大江広元), an adviser to Minamoto no Yoritomo. Motonari was called the &quot;Beggar Prince&quot;. He was known as a great strategist who began as a small local warlord (&quot;jizamurai&quot;) of Aki Province and extended his clan&#x27;s power to nearly all of the Chūgoku region through war, marriage, adoption and assassination.

Sandwiched between the powerful Amago and Ōuchi clans, Motonari led his clan by carefully balancing actions and diplomacy. Eventually, Motonari succeeded in defeating both and controlled the entire Chūgoku region. In his later years, he crushed the Ōtomo clan of Bungo Province in Kyūshū. Motonari ruled from Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle, the clan&#x27;s main bastion since the early 14th century. His descendants became lords of the Chōshū Domain.

==Early life==
Mōri Motonari was born on April 16, 1497, under the childhood name Shōjumaru (松寿丸) in a small domain of Aki Province. He was the second son of his father, Mōri Hiromoto. His mother was a daughter of Fukubara Hirotoshi (福原広俊), but her name is unknown. His birthplace is said to be Suzuo Castle (鈴尾城), the base of the Fukubara clan and his mother&#x27;s home. Today, there are stone monuments at the ruins of Suzuo Castle to commemorate the birthplace of Motonari at the castle.

In 1500, his father was involved in a power dispute with the Ashikaga shogunate and the Ōuchi clan and decided to retire. He handed over the head position of the clan to his eldest son, Mōri Okimoto and moved to Tajihi-Sarugake Castle (多治比猿掛城) with his son Shōjumaru. Okimoto then took over Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle, the main stronghold of the clan.

History remembers the young Mōri Shōjumaru as a fearless daredevil. It is said he escaped by night with some other children from his father&#x27;s castle and met lord Amago Tsunehisa and his troops. Shōjumaru thought they were the ghosts of the Heike clan samurai, and so tried to become famous with a ghost hunt, a practice favored for the education of the youth of &quot;buke&quot; families. And so, Shōjumaru came openly to challenge the mounted warrior who looked to him like the general of the troops. It was Tsunehisa. The other children were trembling in fear, but not Shōjumaru. The young lord shot an arrow at the veteran lord. Tsunehisa swiftly caught it with his bare hand. Impressed by the bravery of his young opponent, Tsunehisa spared the boys, looking forward to battle against an adult Motonari.

The following year in 1501 his mother died and in 1506 his father died due to alcohol poisoning. Shōjumaru stayed at Tajihi-Sarugake Castle but his vassal Inoue Motomori (井上元盛) began embezzling land and was turned out of the castle. Because he was now both impoverished and from a powerful family he was called the &quot;Beggar Prince&quot; (乞食若殿) by the common people. The young Shōjumaru was raised by a foster mother Sugi no Ōkata (杉大方), who was a great influence on him; they grew very close. She got him in the habit facing the sun and saying a Buddhist prayer every morning.

In 1511, Shōjumaru officially became an adult and had his &quot;genpuku&quot; ceremony. He received the name Mōri Motonari (毛利元就).
In 1516, his brother Okimoto died suddenly like their father due to alcohol poisoning. Okimoto&#x27;s infant son, Kōmatsumaru (幸松丸) succeeded as head of the clan and Motonari became his regent.

After the sudden deaths of his father and brother the Mōri clan was left weak and vulnerable. The most powerful lord of the region, Takeda Motoshige (武田元繁) of Satoukanayama Castle (佐東銀山城), took advantage of the situation and gathered an army of 5,000 and in October, 1517 advanced into the territory of the Mōri&#x27;s Kikkawa clan allies surrounding Arita Castle (有田城). A few weeks later, Motoshige dispatched a raid into the Mōri clan&#x27;s territory and set fire to houses in Tajihi (多治比). Motonari went in place of his nephew Kōmatsumaru to relieve Arita Castle from the advancing Takeda forces. This was Motonari&#x27;s first battle that would decide the fate of the Mōri clan and would become known as the Battle of Arita-Nakaide.

===Battle of Arita-Nakaide===

With most of the Ōuchi clan forces preoccupied in Kyoto with Ōuchi Yoshioki, the Mōri were unable to call on them for assistance, and Motonari instead mobilized his clan and called on their supporters. Motonari was also aided by his younger brother, Aiō Mototsuna. In total the Mōri strength comprised around 850 men, reinforced by 300 from the Kikkawa clan, for a total of around 1,000. This force marched towards Arita Castle and on the way encountered the Takeda vanguard, commanded by Kumagai Motonao (熊谷元直), commanding about 500 men. The Mōri and their allies stood off and engaged the Takeda with archery fire. Kumagai Motonao was in the front ranks and was encouraging his men when he was struck and killed by an arrow. Takeda Motoshige was meanwhile with the main army at Arita Castle. Learning of Motonao&#x27;s demise, he drew up his forces and marched to engage the smaller Mōri resistance. The Takeda encountered the Mōri and Kikkawa occupying the opposite bank of the Uchikawa River (又打川) and a bitter struggle ensued. Heavily outnumbered, the Mōri-led forces began to falter and fall back, rallying only when Motonari pleaded with them to stand their ground. Takeda Motoshige himself advanced across the river on horseback but was struck by an arrow and killed. The Takeda broke and retreated, leaving Mōri Motonari the victor. The battle was the start of the decline of the Aki-Takeda clan and the start of the military expansion of the Mōri. Mōri Motonari&#x27;s name finally became known in the country.

===Service under Amago clan===
In 1518 Amago Tsunehisa made a series of raids into the Ōuchi clan&#x27;s lands, falling back with the return of Ōuchi Yoshioki from Kyōto. In 1521 a formal peace treaty was signed between the two clans but it lasted but one year. Also sometime around 1522, Motonari married the daughter of Kikkawa Kunitsune (吉川国経) the lord of Ogurayama Castle; this match would not only secure the friendship of the Kikkawa clan but would in time produce three fine sons. This was an important alliance as the Kikkawa were powerful in Aki Province and their land lay directly to the north of Yoshida, the Mōri heartland on the border with Iwami Province. Motonari had thus already extended his influence north in the direction of the silver-rich Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine and south towards the Inland Sea.

In 1522, Tsunehisa marched into Aki Province, forcing Motonari, whose lands sat directly in the Amago&#x27;s path, to submit. Motonari was immediately dispatched against Kagamiyama Castle (鏡山城) while Tsunehisa himself struck at Kanayama Castle (金山城). Tsunehisa made no progress against Kanayama and retreated, but Motonari was eventually successful at the Battle of Kagamiyama Castle (鏡山城の戦) in 1523. Motonari had problems taking the castle because the lord of Kagamiyama Castle, Kurata Fusanobu (蔵田房信), put up a strong fight, so Motonari persuaded his uncle Kurata Naonobu (蔵田直信) to betray the castle. After the battle Motonari tried to save Naonobu but Amago Tsunehisa executed him for his shameful and disloyal act. It may be that Tsunehisa became aware of Motonari&#x27;s talent and wary of his expansion, for from then on a rift would grow between Tsunehisa and Motonari.

==Early Rise==
===Leadership of the Mōri clan===
In July 1523, Motonari&#x27;s nephew Kōmatsumaru, the titular head of the clan, died suddenly at the age of nine. The senior Mōri vassals met and decided to offer the leadership to Motonari and on August 10 he entered Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle as its new lord. However, some among the senior vassals dissented from the decision and in 1524 any sense of security was broken when Mōri suffered the defection of his vassal Katsura Hirozumi (桂広澄), and was forced to defeat the traitor in open battle not far from Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle. Also in 1524, Motonari learned of a conspiracy led by a vassal, Sakagami Sosuke, to murder him and elevate his half-brother Aiō Mototsuna to the leadership. The rebellion was crushed at Funayama Castle in April.

===Service under Ōuchi clan===
Along with the family troubles concerning succession, Motonari and Amago Tsunehisa gradually grew hostile towards one another. In March, 1525 Motonari and several other local lords decided to change allegiance to Ōuchi Yoshioki. In June, Yoshioki sent his army to Kagamiyama Castle and took it from the Amago clan. Considering Kagamiyama&#x27;s weak defenses on a low hill, Yoshioki built a new castle called Tsuchiyama Castle at the western edge of Saijo Basin on a high mountain and demolished Kagamiyama.

In 1529 Yoshioki died and was succeeded by his son Ōuchi Yoshitaka. Amago Tsunehisa began negotiating with Takahashi Okimitsu (高橋興光), a maternal relative of the late Mōri Kōmatsumaru who had earlier schemed to place Motonari&#x27;s brother, Aiō Mototsuna, as head of the Mōri clan. Motonari acted quickly and crushed the Takahashi clan, taking their vast territory from Aki Province to Iwami Province. He paid a high price for the conquest, however, because Motonari&#x27;s eldest daughter had been a political hostage of the Takahashi clan and was murdered by them in revenge.

A rebellion broke out against the Ōuchi clan in 1532; in response, thirty-two vassals presented Motonari with an oath in which they sought a guarantee that he would not require them to give up their status as small-scale lords, in return for which they promised to jointly undertake the repair of walls and irrigation ditches and the disciplining of traitorous vassals.

On September 25, 1533, Motonari was granted the imperial court rank of the Junior Fifth, Lower Grade in remembrance of his ancestor Ōe no Hiromoto&#x27;s title. Ōuchi Yoshitaka approved of this and paid the stipend for the position. Although this place at court had become only a sinecure, Motonari nevertheless demonstrated to the other lords in Aki Province that he had the backing of both the imperial court and the Ōuchi clan.

===Consolidation of Mōri&#x27;s holdings===
In 1534, Motonari began consolidating the Mōri&#x27;s holdings in Aki, gathering local allies, chief among these being the Shishido, Kumagai, and Amano. He also married one of his daughters to Shishido Takaie (宍戸隆家). 
In 1535, Tagayama Castle (多賀山城) surrendered to Motonari. Over the next twelve months Motonari defeated the Miya and Tagayama clans. Motonari also made ties with his former enemies, the Aki-Takeda clan and Kumagai clan, creating a strong network of power. By the end of the decade the Ōuchi and Amago families began to see the Mōri with new respect and suspicion. The Amago clearly would not have any faith in Motonari as he had betrayed them and defeated their allies. The Ōuchi were also growing suspicious of the Mōri&#x27;s growing power, so in 1537, Motonari&#x27;s eldest son Mōri Takamoto was given as a political hostage to the Ōuchi clan to strengthen their relationship. He would stay until 1540.

In 1539 Ōuchi Yoshitaka fought the Ōtomo clan and Shōni clan of northern Kyūshū, defeating the Shōni clan to win control of the area. In the same year, Sato-Kanayama Castle (佐東銀山城) owned by the Takeda clan on the Amago side fell to the Ōuchi clan despite reinforcements from the Amago clan. The family head Takeda Nobuzane (武田信実) escaped to Wakasa (若狭) where the Takeda had a branch family and later took refuge with the Amago clan.

===Siege of Koriyama===

Amago Tsunehisa had nominally retired and turned over the leadership of the clan to his grandson, Haruhisa (also known as Akihisa). Amago Haruhisa conceived of a plan to destroy Mōri Motonari and bring Aki province under the sway of the Amago. When a council of the Amago retainers was called to discuss the planned campaign, almost all spoke in favor of the attack. Amago Hisayuki, however, considered the risks to be too great and spoke out against it, but was derided by Amago Tsunehisa as a coward and publicly humiliated. Amago Hisayuki was given the task of harrying the Mōri&#x27;s ally, the Shishido clan in Aki, as part of an initial and concurrent operation of the larger Amago campaign into Aki. Amago Haruhisa, with 30,000 men, attacked Motonari&#x27;s main base, Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle, which was defended by 8,000 men.

The initial phase of the campaign began in June 1540. Amago Hisayuki, his son Amago Masahisa and his nephew Kunihisa led their troops to attack the domain of Motonari&#x27;s ally, the Shishido clan. This foray had little effect except to deny Haruhisa of some of his most capable generals and soldiers for the attack on Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle.

In August, Amago Haruhisa gathered a force of 30,000 and departed Izumo Province, moving into the vicinity of Motonari&#x27;s Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle and establishing a headquarters nearby. Meanwhile, Motonari had evacuated over 5,000 of Yoshida&#x27;s citizens inside the walls of Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle, which was defended by around 3,000 soldiers. By this time urgent requests for aid had been dispatched to the Ōuchi in Suo Province. Two days after arriving, the Amago launched an attack on Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle, which continued for several months. 
The Ōuchi relief army, consisting of 10,000 men led by Sue Takafusa, finally departed Suō Province in November, pausing on Miyajima to offer prayers for victory at the Itskushima Shrine before landing in Aki and marching towards Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle. They arrived outside Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle in December 1540, four months after the siege had begun. A series of skirmishes ensued between the opposing armies into the following month (January, 1541), which was largely to the detriment of the Amago. Motonari successfully defended his castle from an attack by Amago Haruhisa in the 1540–41 Siege of Koriyama.

In the meantime, the other Amago force under Amago Hisayuki that had been dispatched to threaten the Shishido arrived. Its headquarters on Tenjinyama (天神山) were attacked by the Mōri and Ōuchi. In the ensuing action Amago Hisayuki was killed by an arrow and the Amago suffered heavy losses. In the wake of this fight, the Amago retainers, noting the army&#x27;s dwindling supplies and poor morale, elected to retreat. The Mōri and Ōuchi duly pursued but were hindered by snow.

The same year (1540), they attacked the Amago retainer Takeda Nobuzane (武田信実) who had been hiding with the Amago clan at Sato-Ginzan Castle. Nobuzane fled to Izumo Province and the Aki-Takeda clan was utterly annihilated. In addition, Motonari took over the Kawachi Keigoshu (川内警固衆), a pirate organization owned by the Aki-Takeda clan, which would become a large part of the Mōri navy later.

===First Siege of Toda castle===

From 1542 to 1543 Motonari followed Ōuchi Yoshitaka in the First Siege of Toda Castle. In this battle they penetrated deep into the Amago clan territory but their supply line was broken and Kikkawa Okitsune (吉川興経) betrayed them. Motonari surrounded Gassantoda Castle (富田城) but the Ōuchi troops retreated. During the retreat Motonari almost lost his life but his general Watanabe Hajime covered Motonari&#x27;s escape with a heroic rearguard action. Motonari returned safely to Aki Province. As a result of the battle the power of the Ōuchi clan weakened.

===Extended Mōri clan power===
In 1544 Motonari gave his third son, Tokujumaru (徳寿丸), for adoption to the Numata branch of the Kobayakawa clan (沼田小早川氏) who were famous for their naval forces. Tokujumaru later became known as Kobayakawa Takakage. This same year Amago Haruhisa&#x27;s expeditionary force attacked the Miyoshi clan in Bingo Province. Motonari dispatched generals Kodama Naritada and Fukubara Sadatoshi against Haruhisa but they were forced to retreat.

Motonari lost his wife Myōkyū in 1545 and, crying, he did not emerge from his room for three days.
Motonari then announced that he intended to enter retirement in 1546 and hand over the leadership of the Mōri to his son Mōri Takamoto. However, it was understood by all that Motonari was still the true head of the clan wielding all the power.

In 1547 Motonari sent his second son, Shōnojirō (少輔次郎), to be adopted by the Kikkawa clan which was his deceased wife Myōkyū&#x27;s family. Shōnojirō would become known as Kikkawa Motoharu. The head of the clan, Kikkawa Okitsune (吉川興経), was a rival of Motonari who had allied himself with the Amago clan in the 1540s. Motonari responded by pressuring Okitsune to adopt his son Motoharu and in 1550 Okitsune was compelled to retire, later being killed on Motonari&#x27;s orders by Kumagai Nobunao (熊谷信直). Kikkawa Tsuneyo (吉川経世), who was the uncle of Okitsune stayed on as a retainer of the Mōri. In 1550 Motoharu entered the Kikkawa clan&#x27;s main castle as its lord.

Motonari also intervened in the succession of the Kobayakawa clan. His son, Kobayakawa Takakage was already head of one branch of the clan, the Numata. The other branch, the Takehara, had lost their clan head Kobayakawa Masahira (小早川正平) at the Siege of Toda Castle and the new head of the clan, Kobayakawa Shigehira (小早川繁平) was young and blind from an eye illness. In 1550, with the backing of Motonari, Takakage also became head of the Takehara branch, merging the two branches of the clan. With this action the armed retainers of both branches became Motonari&#x27;s to command.

In 1549 Motonari went down to Yamaguchi with his sons Motoharu and Takakage. Ōuchi Yoshitaka&#x27;s vassals Sagara Taketō and Sue Takafusa were engaged in a dispute over the future of the Ōuchi clan. After his defeat at the Siege of Toda Castle, Ōuchi Yoshitaka had grown tired of fighting battles and had retreated to work with literature and the arts. Motonari was sick during his stay in Yamaguchi and it took him three months to return to Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle. His caretaker while he was sick was Inoue Mitsutoshi (井上光俊). 
Inoue Motokane (井上元兼) was the son of Inoue Mitsukane (井上光兼) and the de facto head of a notable Aki family that nominally served the Mōri clan. He held Tenjinyama (天神山), which was just to the south of Motonari&#x27;s Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle. As Motokane grew more powerful militarily and economically, he began to test the leadership of Motonari, who he became openly critical of. In 1550 Motonari forced Motokane and many members of his household to commit suicide on the grounds of treasonous behavior, an act that secured the Mōri as Aki&#x27;s most powerful family. The Inoue family were afterwards allowed to continue on as Mōri retainers. Motonari&#x27;s previous caretaker in Yamaguchi, Inoue Mitsutoshi, escaped the purge.

At this point Motonari now had Iwami Province with the Kikkawa clan, Bingo Province, Seto Inland Sea with the Kobayakawa clan and with the two forces nearly dominated the whole of Aki Province.

==Conflict with Ouchi==
===Tainei-ji incident===

In 1551, Sue Takafusa revolted against his lord Ōuchi Yoshitaka in the Tainei-ji incident, forcing him to commit &quot;seppuku&quot;. Takafusa changed his name to Harukata on this occasion and installed the next lord of the clan, Ōuchi Yoshinaga, but effectively led the Ōuchi clan and its armies, intent on military expansion. In 1554, Mōri Motonari became the leader of the Mōri clan. As a vassal of the Ōuchi clan, he wanted to avenge the betrayed Yoshitaka, and so he rebelled against Sue, whose territorial ambitions were depleting clan resources.

The Sue gathered a large army of as many as 30,000 men. Motonari, while stronger than ever, could scarcely muster half that. Nonetheless, he fared well in the early stages of their conflict, defeating Sue troops at the Battle of Oshikibata in June. By using what had already become hallmark Mōri trickery and by bribing a number of Sue&#x27;s men, Motonari managed to balance out the odds somewhat. For his part, Sue made no major moves against Koriyama, and with the end of the year&#x27;s campaigning season, Motonari was allowed some breathing space.

===Battle of Miyajima===
In the early summer of 1555, Sue was again threatening, and Motonari was hard-pressed. Harukata was by no means a poor fighter, and the danger of Motonari&#x27;s retainers and allies deserting the Mōri led him to adopt a bold and unorthodox scheme. His plan involved Miyajima, home to the Itsukushima Shrine and a place combatants had traditionally avoided on religious grounds. Mōri&#x27;s generals had suggested the occupation of Miyajima, which was strategically located just off the Aki coast in the Inland Sea, but Motonari had refused the idea on tactical grounds. For Miyajima to be a viable base of operations, Sakurao Castle – the nearest fort on the mainland to Miyajima – would also have to be held. Should Sakurao fall, any army on Miyajima risked being isolated. Yet Mōri&#x27;s own insight into the weakness of the Miyajima position led him to form a plan in which he would lure Sue into this exact trap. Naturally, such a tactic would require Sue&#x27;s unwitting cooperation, and for inducement, Motonari immediately gave orders that Miyajima was to be occupied. A fort, Miyao Castle, was thrown up quite near the Itsukushima shrine and Motonari proclaimed publicly his woe that it would not hold out long against an attack. In September, Sue fell into the trap. He landed with the bulk of his army on Miyajima and assaulted the (intentionally) thin defenses of Miyao Castle. When the island had been secured (including the capture of Sakurao), Sue threw up a few fortifications on To-no-oka (Pagoda Hill) and sat down to plot strategy. From his point of view the capture of Miyajima was a strategic boon. From this secure springboard he could embark to almost any point along the Aki coast, as well as Bingo Province. Since the following autumn, Mōri had assumed a largely defensive posture, and Sue had some reason to feel comfortable in his new forward headquarters. Sue thus made his second great mistake – he became complacent.

Mōri put his strategy into effect. Within a week he retook Sakurao Castle and played his trump card – the Murakami pirates. Gathering the pirates&#x27; naval strength, he set out to surprise Sue on Miyajima, and picked a perfect night on which to do so. On October 1, after dark and in a driving thunderstorm, Motonari and his sons put to sea. So the Battle of Miyajima began. As a diversion, Kobayakawa Takakage sailed straight past the Sue positions on To-no-oka while Motonari, Mōri Takamoto, and Kikkawa Motoharu landed just to the east and out of sight. Takakage doubled back and landed at dawn, attacking the Sue forces practically in the shadow of Miyajima&#x27;s great &quot;torii&quot; gate. Motonari then assaulted the confused Sue troops from behind, and the result was a rout for Sue Harukata, who committed suicide at Oenoura, a small island inlet. Many of his troops followed suit, and for Motonari, the battle was utterly decisive.

Motonari had annihilated the Sue who had aspired to take the place of the Ōuchi clan. While it would take the Mōri until 1557 to force Ōuchi Yoshinaga to commit suicide and years longer to completely bring Suo province and Nagato province under Mōri&#x27;s control, Motonari was now the most powerful lord in western Japan.

In the same year 1557, Motonari once again announced his retirement and Takamoto inherited the formal leadership of the clan. Even after Motonari&#x27;s retirement, he continued to wield actual control over the clan&#x27;s affairs.

==Conflict with Amago==
In 1554, Motonari&#x27;s intrigues led to the death of Amago Kunihisa in battle with Amago Haruhisa. Kunihisa, the son of Amago Tsunehisa, led a faction named the Shingūtō (新宮党) after the town, Shingu, where it was based. He had been trusted with military matters by his father Tsunehisa but he often looked down upon those who did not do well on the battlefield and was obnoxious from time to time. Supposedly, Motonari tricked Haruhisa into believing that Kunihisa and Era Fusahide (江良房栄) intended to take over the Amago clan. The circumstances may have been aggravated by Kunihisa&#x27;s arrogance towards young Haruhisa. The death of Kunihisa and the purge of the Shingūtō weakened the Amago clan considerably.

In 1556, Yamabuki Castle (山吹城) was captured by the leader of the Amago clan, Amago Haruhisa, and Motonari lost control of the Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine.

When Haruhisa died in 1560, his son, Amago Yoshihisa, succeeded as head of the Amago. The shōgun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru wished for peace between the Amago and Mōri clans, but Motonari ignored his plea and invaded Izumo Province in 1562. So began the Second Siege of Toda Castle.

===Second Siege of Toda castle===

The Second Siege of Toda Castle lasted from 1562 to 1563. When Motonari attacked Amago Yoshihisa at Toda Castle, Yoshihisa executed his retainer, Moriyama Hisakane (宇山久兼), whom Yoshihisa feared would betray him. This caused most of his remaining troops to desert, and later Amago surrendered to Motonari. Yoshihisa was permitted to become a monk and was held captive at Enmei-ji. With the head of the Amago clan gone, the clan members were forced to serve as retainers to other daimyo. As a monk, Yoshihisa changed his name to Yurin (友林). After Mōri Terumoto became the head of Mōri clan, he became a retainer under Terumoto.

After defeating the Amago clan in Izumo Province, Motonari had become lord of eight provinces of the Chūgoku region. However, Amago Katsuhisa, son of Amago Masahisa (尼子誠久), led a remnant of the clan in rebellion with support from Yamanaka Yukimori.

Motonari&#x27;s eldest son, Mōri Takamoto, while &quot;en route&quot; to attack the Amago clan in 1563, died of a sudden disease, though assassination by poison was suspected. Saddened and angered by his death, Motonari ordered all those whom he thought responsible to be punished.

In 1566, Takamoto&#x27;s son and Motonari&#x27;s grandson Mōri Terumoto was selected as Motonari&#x27;s heir, but Motonari continued to wield the true power over the Mōri clan.

In 1570, Terumoto defeated Amago Katsuhisa at the Battle of Nunobeyama. Katsuhisa then fled to the Oki Islands. In 1578, Katsuhisa returned from the Oki Islands and captured Tajima and Inaba Provinces. He then occupied Kozuki Castle for Oda clan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and defended it against the Mōri clan. Later, he was attacked by Kobayakawa Takakage and Kikkawa Motoharu, defeated and forced to commit suicide.

==Conflict with Ōtomo==
After Ōuchi Yoshinaga, Otomo Sorin&#x27;s younger brother, was forced to commit suicide by the advance of Mōri forces in 1557, Mōri Motonari captured Yoshinaga&#x27;s Moji fortress in 1558. In response, Otomo Sorin recaptured the castle in September 1559, but the Mōri, led by Kobayakawa Takakage and Ura Munekatsu, quickly took the castle back. In 1561, forces under Ōtomo Sōrin attacked the Moji castle in alliance with the Portuguese trader, but the assault failed, and the castle finally remained in Mōri possession.

However, Motonari&#x27;s advance against the Ōtomo was checked by the 1568 alliance between the Amago and Ōtomo clans. In 1569, Mōri Motonari led the assault on the Ōtomo clan&#x27;s Tachibana castle which was held by Tachibana Dosetsu. Motonari won and captured the castle, but was driven back by Otomo Sorin in the Battle of Tatarahama that followed the siege. The battle of the Mōri clan with this larger allied force was part of Yamanaka Yukimori and Amago Katsuhisa&#x27;s arrangement with Ōtomo. Motonari was distracted from his designs against the Ōtomo in Kyushu by his inability to defeat the Amago in Izumo province, some distance away in Honshu. As a result, he abandoned Tachibana castle and withdrew from his campaign against the Ōtomo.

==Death==
Motonari had been suffering from illness during the first half of the 1560s so the shōgun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, sent him his doctor, Manase Dōsan (曲直瀬道三), to treat him. It seems that his physical condition improved temporarily and in 1567 his last son, Kadokikumaru (才菊丸) was born, later known as Kobayakawa Hidekane.

Mōri Motonari died on June 14, 1571, at Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle at the age of 74. The cause of death is said to be both esophageal cancer and old age.

==Legacy==
Motonari is remembered as one of the greatest Japanese warlords of the mid-16th century. Under his leadership the Mōri expanded from a few districts in Aki Province to rule over ten of the Chūgoku region&#x27;s eleven provinces, and Motonari was known even in his day as a master of wiles and trickery, a warlord whose schemes won as many battles as his soldiers. He is best remembered for an event that probably never took place – the &quot;lesson of the three arrows&quot;. In this parable, Motonari gives each of his sons an arrow to break. He then gives them three arrows bundled, and points out that while one may be broken easily, not so three united as one. The three sons were of course Takamoto, Motoharu, and Takakage, and the lesson is one that Japanese children still learn in school today. It is not known for certain if this actually happened or if it is an apocryphal legend. Motonari in fact had six other sons, two of whom appear to have died in childhood. The others included Motoaki, Motokiyo, Motomasa and (Kobayakawa) Hidekane.

Shiji Hiroyoshi, Kuchiba Michiyoshi, Kumagai Nobunao, Fukubara Sadatoshi, Katsura Motozumi, Kodama Naritada, Kokushi Motosuke, Hiraga Hirosuke, and Ichikawa Tsuneyoshi assisted Mōri Motonari in his rule. His greatest generals, however, were his own sons Kobayakawa Takakage and Kikkawa Motoharu, the &#x27;Two Rivers&#x27; (a play on the &#x27;kawa&#x27; characters in their names).

The well known &quot;one line, three stars&quot; emblem of the Mōri was inherited from the family&#x27;s ancestor, Ōe no Hiromoto.

In addition to being a gifted general Motonari was also a noted poet and patron of the arts. Surviving letters written by his grandson Mōri Terumoto describe Motonari as a strict and demanding man with a sharp eye. He was succeeded by his grandson Terumoto, who was the son of the late Takamoto.

==Family==
In all, Motonari had nine sons and three daughters; five children were by his wife, three by a consort from the Nomi clan, and four by a consort from the Miyoshi clan.

There is also speculation that Ninomiya Naritoki (二宮就辰, 1546–1607) was Motonari&#x27;s son with a woman from the Yada clan (矢田氏).

==Popular culture==
&quot;See People of the Sengoku period in popular culture.&quot;

Motonari often lives far beyond his means in popular culture, acting as the representative of his clan in affairs that take place far after his death (encountering Oda Nobunaga in the Mōri&#x27;s later battles against him for just one instance).
* Portrayed by Nakamura Hashinosuke III in the 1997 NHK Taiga drama TV series &quot;&quot;. It was a year-long broadcast that retold the story of how Motonari rose from the leader of an insignificant military clan to become one of the most powerful warlords of the Sengoku period.
* He is represented as a playable character in the video game Sengoku Basara and all its sequels. In the game, he was described as an uncaring leader ambitious to conquer all of Japan. He was first armed with a saihai, then with a circular blade.
* He is represented as a playable character in the video game Samurai Warriors series.
* He is represented as a character in &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot; as the warlord of the Greenleaf Kingdom, with his partner Pokémon being Servine and Serperior.
* The parable regarding Motonari, his three sons, and the lesson of the three arrows is believed have been a source of inspiration for Akira Kurosawa when he was writing his epic film &quot;Ran&quot;. The name of the local J League soccer team, Sanfrecce Hiroshima, was also inspired by this story. &quot;San&quot; means three in Japanese, and &quot;frecce&quot; means arrows in Italian.

<text>Count was a Japanese diplomat and politician. He became Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1890 and worked to revise unequal treaties. He served as plenipotentiary at the peace conference in Shimonoseki after the First Sino-Japanese War.

==Early life==
Mutsu Munemitsu was born in Wakayama domain, Kii Province as the sixth son of Date Munehiro, a &quot;samurai&quot; retainer of the Kii Tokugawa Clan. His father was active in the &quot;Sonnō jōi&quot; movement, and Mutsu Munemitsu joined forces with Sakamoto Ryōma and Itō Hirobumi in the movement to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate.

==Meiji bureaucrat==

After the Meiji Restoration, Mutsu held a number of posts in the new Meiji government, including that of governor of Hyōgo Prefecture and later governor of Kanagawa Prefecture, both of which were host to foreign settlements. He was head of the Land Tax Reform of 1873–1881, and served on the &quot;Genrōin&quot;. He conspired to assist Saigō Takamori in the Satsuma Rebellion and was imprisoned from 1878 until 1883. While in prison he translated Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Utilitarianism&quot; into Japanese.

After he left prison, he rejoined the government as an official of the Foreign Ministry, and in 1884 was sent to Europe for studies. Later he became Japanese Minister to Washington D.C. (1888–1890), during which time he established formal diplomatic relations between Japan and Mexico, and partially revised the unequal treaties between Japan and the United States.

On his return to Japan in 1890, he became Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. He was also elected to the House of Representatives of Japan from the 1st Wakayama District for a single term in the 1890 General Election. In 1892, he became Foreign Minister in the Itō Hirobumi cabinet. In 1894, he concluded the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1894, which finally ended the unequal treaty status between Japan and Great Britain.

Mutsu was the lead Japanese negotiator in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ended the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895). In the wake of an attempt on the life of the Chinese leading negotiator Li Hongzhang by a Japanese fanatic, the Japanese government voluntarily reduced the size of the indemnity it planned to claim from China, and Mutsu famously remarked, &#x27;Li&#x27;s misfortune is the good fortune of the Great Ch&#x27;ing Empire&#x27;. The Triple Intervention by France, Germany and Russia reversed the gains that Mutsu had negotiated from China in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and the Japanese public blamed Mutsu for the national humiliation. He resigned all government posts in May 1896 and moved to Ōiso, Kanagawa, where he wrote his personal diplomatic memoirs &quot;&quot; (蹇々録) after the treaty was signed to explain his views and actions. However, his memoirs could not be published until 1923 due to the diplomatic secrets they contained.

Mutsu lived in what is now Kyu-Furukawa Gardens. Mutsu died of tuberculosis in Takinogawa, Tokyo Prefecture in 1897.

Mutsu was ennobled with the title of &quot;hakushaku&quot; (count) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system at the end of the Sino-Japanese War.

<doc id="316327" wikidata="Q7113688" url="?curid=316327" title="Overhead join">
<text>An overhead join is a conventional method for an aircraft to approach and safely land at an airfield. It helps a pilot to integrate with any air traffic pattern near an airfield, join any circuit, and land.

Aircraft may arrive at the landing site from any direction, so a safe means of integrating into existing traffic and aligning with the runway is required. The overhead join is the standard method used in the UK, South Africa and other Commonwealth countries at smaller airports by general aviation aircraft flying under the visual flight rules (VFR), and especially at airfields with no regular radio service.

Prior to arrival, the pilot might talk with air traffic control (ATC) over the radio to establish the runway in use, the circuit height and direction (left or right hand), and the QFE (atmospheric pressure) of the field. If the airfield is not equipped with ATC or radio, the pilot will establish these things before arrival by contacting the airfield prior to departure, or by using weather forecasts and the like. 

This information is verified on arrival by overflying the airfield and looking out for the wind direction indications from a wind sock, smoke from fires, etc., or any ground signals in the signals square (if present). This involves positioning the aircraft so that it is flying across the direction of the runway and typically at higher than the circuit pattern for the airfield. 

The pilot crosses the runway from the normal circuit for that runway, looking out for other traffic in the circuit, and descends to circuit height (often AGL for GA aircraft or for helicopters or at microlight airfields) on the &quot;dead side&quot; (opposite that of the normal circuit). With no traffic in circuit, the circuit is joined by crossing the upwind threshold and then turning downwind. With other traffic present in the circuit, the aircraft might be positioned downwind in the circuit behind or between other traffic in order to land in turn. 

Alternatives to the overhead join are to directly join the circuit by entering at a suitable corner, or a straight-in approach. If available, ATC will negotiate with the pilot which is the most appropriate method according to the current traffic situation.

<text>Nathanael is a biblical given name derived from the Hebrew נְתַנְאֵל (&quot;Netan&#x27;el&quot;), which means &quot;God/El has given&quot; or &quot;Gift of God/El.&quot; [[Nathaniel]] is the variant form of this name and it stands to this day as the usual and most common spelling for a masculine given name. Other variants include Nathanel, Netanel and Nathanial. A short form is Nate.

Several figures in the Bible bear forms of this name. In the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), the name is shared by a prince (or chieftain) of the Tribe of Issachar (Numbers 7:18–23, in the Naso parsha) and by a brother of King David (1 Chronicles 2:14). In the New Testament, Nathanael is said to be an early follower of Jesus of Nazareth, according to the Gospel of John (1:45; 21:2). 

The related name [[List of minor Old Testament figures, A–K#Elnathan|Elnathan]] could be rendered &quot;Gift of [[Names_of_God_in_Judaism#El|El]]&quot; (Hebrew God). Four people named Elnathan are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible: one at , and three in . A similar ancient name with the same meaning as Elnathan, is Jonathan which signifies &quot;YHWH has given&quot;.

<text>Hudson&#x27;s Hope is a district municipality in northeastern British Columbia, Canada, in the Peace River Regional District. Having been first settled along the Peace River in 1805, it is the third-oldest European-Canadian community in the province, although it was not incorporated until 1965. Most jobs in the economy are associated with the nearby W. A. C. Bennett Dam and Peace Canyon Dam, and timber logging.

There is debate about the origin of Hudson&#x27;s Hope&#x27;s name. One theory derives the word &quot;Hudson&#x27;s&quot; from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and &quot;Hope&quot; from the Scottish word &quot;hope&quot; meaning a &quot;small enclosed valley&quot;. Another theory has the name derived from a prospector named Hudson who came to the area searching for gold. The District of Hudson&#x27;s Hope slogan is the &quot;Playground of the Peace&quot;.

==History==
Nomadic aboriginal Dene zaa tribes originally occupied the area. Alexander Mackenzie and his team of voyageurs became the first Europeans to travel through as they canoed westward along the Peace River in 1793. Simon Fraser followed in 1805 and established a North West Company fur-trading outpost, the Rocky Mountain Portage House, at the foot of the canyon directly across the river from the current townsite. This was the only significant portage site on the Peace River between Fort Chipewyan and Fort McLeod.

The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company took control of the fort after merging with the North West Company in 1821 but abandoned it in 1823 after a massacre in the nearby Fort St. John outpost. The HBC opened a new trading post on the southern river banks in 1866 to compete against free traders coming in from the west. (Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Archives B.39/b/18 p. 57) Though its origins are unclear, the name &quot;Hudson&#x27;s Hope&quot; was first recorded in 1868. Theories on its origin include an explorer named Hudson searching for the Northwest Passage, or a prospector named Henry Hudson searching for gold, or the use of the English and Scottish word &quot;hope&quot;, meaning a small enclosed valley. In 1899 the fort was moved to the townsite&#x27;s present-day location on the north bank to better serve those portaging northwestwards.

Much of the area was explored by prospectors and surveying crews as the Peace River Block was opened to mineral staking in 1908 and homestead claims in 1912. A permanent settlement was established in 1912 by a police officer, who was previously stationed in Fort St. John, and a friend from Victoria, who staked the first homestead. Others joined them as they travelled through Edmonton, Dunvegan, and Fort St. John to found the communities of Beryl Prairie and Lynx Creek. Soon, as other settlers came, they built a post office, hotel, and church around the trading post. In 1923 settlers opened the first school. Coal was discovered a few years earlier and used locally. Commercial coal mining, attempted in 1923, was not successful due to the isolation and high transportation costs to other markets. Construction of the Alaska Highway in 1942 created a high local demand and stimulated commercial coal mining.

Major development came to the rural area in the 1960s, when the provincial government planned and constructed the W. A. C. Bennett Dam and its associated Gordon M. Shrum Generating Station for hydroelectric power. Its construction involved thousands of workers; the project was served by the distant highway and railway to the south at Chetwynd. To help organize and finance the project, the Hudson&#x27;s Hope Improvement District was incorporated in 1962 and the District Municipality of Hudson&#x27;s Hope was incorporated 2 years later. The two incorporated areas merged in 1967 after construction was completed. As the reservoir was filled and the dam went online in 1968, most of the thousands of workers left for other areas.

Soon afterwards a second dam, the Peace Canyon Dam, was planned and constructed, several kilometers downstream from the first. The second dam went online in 1980. The town has remained geographically isolated and is economically dependent on BC Hydro as its single major employer. It has marketed its isolation and extensive outdoor recreational opportunities as a benefit to living in the area.

==Geography and climate==

The main townsite is wide, long flat along the north bank of the Peace River, and the rural communities of Beryl Prairie, Lynx Creek, and Farrell Creek. The Peace River originates at the W.A.C. Bennett Dam from the Peace Reach Arm of Williston Lake and flows around the tall Portage Mountain and through Dinosaur Lake. The water is retained here for three days before being released to the Peace Canyon Dam. It flows northeastward past the townsite, and the rural communities of Lynx Creek and Farrell Creek, and eventually into the Arctic Ocean. The Hudson&#x27;s Hope Suspension Bridge provides passage over the river near the town. The forested foothills of the Rocky Mountains, including Mount Johnson and the Two Ridge Mountain, dominate the area south of the Peace River. The foothills continue north of the river, passing into prairie land at Beryl Prairie.

Dinosaur Lake is the deeply entrenched reservoir of the Peace Canyon Dam, having a surface area of and a volume of . The oligotrophic lake is fed by Williston Lake and 5 tributaries (Gething, Johnson, Moosebar, Starfish and Mogul creeks).

Most of the municipality is forested by aspen and poplar trees. Animals common to the area include moose, bear, deer, sheep, goats and elk. A hatchery annually releases sportsfish, mainly rainbow trout, into the lakes. Dinosaur tracks and fossils have been discovered in the municipality, including deposits that were later covered by the filling of Dinosaur Lake. The ichthyosaur Hudsonelpidia was named after the community after being discovered there in the 1960s.

Historically, winters have been very cold and snowy. However, since the filling of Williston Lake, the largest man-made lake in North America, the winters have been milder with an average January temperature of and annual snowfall of . The municipality has an average growing season of 135 days, the longest in northern BC, with an average July temperature of . With the dams, both the lakes and the river are isothermal at about .

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Hudson&#x27;s Hope had a population of 841 living in 378 of its 460 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,015. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

While the community is one of the province&#x27;s oldest, the first census that included it as a defined subdivision was that of 1966, which recorded 3,068 people. An earlier report put the population at less than 100 in 1954. The 1960s peak was due to workers coming to the area for the planning and construction of the hydroelectric dam.

==Infrastructure==

The town is located along Highway 29, between Chetwynd and Fort St. John. The highway crosses the Peace River via the Hudson&#x27;s Hope Suspension Bridge and runs eastward along the north bank of the Peace River through the townsite, Lynx Creek, and Farrel Creek. From the townsite, the W.A.C. Bennett Dam is west. In total, the district maintains of paved and of unpaved roads with most of the businesses located along the Beattie Road portion of Highway 29. Community facilities and some residential areas are located between Beattie Road and the Peace River, and more residential areas are located on hills north of the downtown area.

The Hudson&#x27;s Hope Airport, west of town, is a small airport with a -long paved runway that handles private and chartered flights. The closest commercial airport, with regularly scheduled flights, is approximately to the east, near Fort St. John. The closest regional bus stop and rail station is about to the south, in Chetwynd.

The town draws its drinking water from the Peace River, and chlorinates and distributes it through of watermains. Sewage is collected through of sanitary sewers and processed in a two-cell lagoon system. The municipality funds weekly garbage collection from households in the townsite and transfer stations in the rural communities. Electrical power is supplied by the provincially owned BC Hydro and natural gas by the privately owned Pacific Natural Gas.

==Economy and education==
Hudson&#x27;s Hope has a predominantly resource-based economy. The community was founded as a trading post along a portage trail but with sternwheelers and steamships navigating the Peace River in the 1800s resource extraction, such as logging and farming, began. The town&#x27;s economy turned towards construction starting in the 1960s with the Bennett Dam followed by the Peace Canyon Dam. Additional staff have been employed with the dams’ museums and tour-related activities.

The only school in the municipality is the Hudson&#x27;s Hope Elementary-Secondary School, administered by School District 60 Peace River North. The school, constructed in 1993, teaches students from kindergarten to grade 12 and has an enrollment of about 220 students. Northern Lights College offers courses at the Hudson&#x27;s Hope Learning Centre that focus on the oil and gas industry, as well as adult basic, continuing, and vocational education.

==Culture and recreation==

The Hudson&#x27;s Hope Museum is located in the old Hudson&#x27;s Bay Store, built in 1942. It has exhibits on the area&#x27;s prehistory (i.e. dinosaur fossils, bones and tracks), frontier times (i.e. aboriginal, North West Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company artifacts), and boom times (i.e. construction of Bennett and Peace Canyon dams). Both dams have museums and offer tours. The museum at the Bennett Dam focuses on the massive engineering and construction programs to build the reservoir and world&#x27;s largest earth-filled dam. The museum at the Peace Canyon Dam focuses on the natural history of the area, especially the dinosaur finds that were discovered during construction of the dam.

The town maintains a library, skating arena, curling rink, and an outdoor heated swimming pool. The Hudson&#x27;s Hope Community Hall is used for theatrical performances, dances, and public meetings. Annual events include a rodeo in June, a fall fair in August, and a torchlight parade in December. The district operates three public parks: Beattie Park with a playground and visitor information centre, Centennial Park with its chainsaw carvings and totem poles, and Memorial Park with tennis courts, swimming pool and toboggan hill. Outside the townsite, the district helps maintain the Beryl Prairie Community Park, and Jamieson Woods Nature Preserve.

Williston Lake, Dinosaur Lake, Cameron Lake and the Peace River are used for canoeing, kayaking, sailing and fishing. In addition to private campgrounds, the district operates four campgrounds. King Gething Park and Alwin Holland Park, both named after 1920s–30s pioneers, are fully serviced campgrounds and RV parks on the north bank of the Peace River, west of the townsite. Dinosaur Lake Campground near the Peace Canyon dam and Cameron Lake Campground near North Cameron Lake were both taken over by the district in 1989 from the province.

==Government and politics==

The District of Hudson&#x27;s Hope has a council-manager form of municipal government. A mayor and six councillors are elected at-large every three years, along with one trustee to the school district. Such a system results in candidates who appeal to the majority of voters. In a December 2, 2012 by-election, Gwen Johansson was elected as the mayor of Hudson&#x27;s Hope, replacing Karen Anderson. In November 2011 Karen Anderson had been elected mayor. She had first been elected mayor in 2008, defeating former mayor Lenore Harwood. The mayor is appointed by the council as the District&#x27;s representative on the board of directors of the Peace River Regional District.

Hudson&#x27;s Hope is situated in the Peace River North provincial electoral district and is represented by Pat Pimm in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Prior to Pimm, the town was represented by Richard Neufeld who was first elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 1991 provincial election with the BC Social Credit Party taking 31% of votes cast at the Hudson&#x27;s Hope polls and re-elected with the Reform Party of BC in 1996 with 44% support, with the BC Liberal Party in 2001 and 2005 with 57% and 41% from Hudson&#x27;s Hope polls, respectively.

Federally, Hudson&#x27;s Hope is located in the Prince George—Peace River riding, which is represented in the House of Commons by Conservative Party Member of Parliament Bob Zimmer. Prior to Zimmer, the town was represented by Jay Hill who was first elected in 1993, then re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006 with 79%, 75%, 64%, and 66%. support from Hudson&#x27;s Hope polls, respectively. Before Hill the riding was represented by Frank Oberle of the Progressive Conservative Party from 1972 to 1993. Oberle served as Minister of State for Science and Technology from 1985 to 1989 and Minister of Forestry from 1990 to 1993.

<doc id="316341" wikidata="Q476350" url="?curid=316341" title="Long-billed dowitcher">
<text>The long-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus) is a medium-sized shorebird with a relatively long bill belonging to the sandpiper family, Scolopacidae. In breeding plumage, adults are characterized by a rufous head and underparts with a darker mottled back and a large white upper rump only seen in flight. They feed in various freshwater habitats with their bill underwater in a &quot;sewing machine&quot; motion and have a mating display where males chase females in flight. The genus, &quot;Limnodromus&quot; is Ancient Greek from &quot;limne&quot;, &quot;marsh&quot; and &quot;dromos&quot;, &quot;racer&quot;. The specific &quot;scolopaceus&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;snipe-like&quot;, from Latin &quot;scolopax, scolopacis&quot;, a snipe or woodcock. The English name is from Iroquois and was first recorded in 1841.

The long-billed dowitcher is similar in appearance to the short-billed dowitcher and was only recognized as a separate species in 1950. Between the two, the best distinguishing field mark is their flight call, especially in winter, when the two species&#x27; plumage can be nearly identical. However, the two species differ ecologically in their habitat preferences and breeding locations. Long-billed dowitchers generally prefer freshwater habitats, and breed in northern Alaska and Siberia; their short-billed counterparts favor saltwater habitats and breed farther east, from southern Alaska across Canada to the maritime provinces.

== Taxonomy ==
The long-billed dowitcher is a bird in the order Charadriiformes, which includes shorebirds, gulls, and alcids. It is part of the Scolopacidae family, and it belongs to the Scolopacinae subfamily along with snipes and woodcocks. Its genus &quot;Limnodromus&quot; includes only two other species; the short-billed dowitcher and the Asian dowitcher.

The long-billed dowitcher was first described by Thomas Say in 1823 under the name &quot;Limnodromus scolopacea&quot;. The taxonomy of the long-billed and short-billed dowitcher has presented difficulties in part due to the variability of the short-billed dowitcher.

For around 100 years the long-billed dowitcher and short-billed dowitcher were recognized as two distinct species. By 1927 the long-billed dowitcher was made a sub-species of the short-billed dowitcher, as the western form, due to bird observations which were similar to both species linking the two geographically. It was not until Frank Pitelka published his monograph, in 1950, that the two dowitcher species were once again accepted as being two distinct species. Further research has shown that the two species are estimated to have diverged genetically more than four million years ago.

== Description ==
The long-billed dowitcher is a medium-sized, stocky sandpiper with a bill about twice the length of its head. In all plumages, the long-billed dowitcher has a whitish supercilium and dark loral stripe that continuous past the eye. The tail is barred black and white with the black being almost twice the width of the white and a large distinctive white rump which extends up to the middle of its back.

Long-billed dowitcher are in breeding plumage from approximately May to late August or early September. In breeding plumage, adults are characterized by a dark crown on top of their head and a rufous neck, chest, and belly underneath with black bars on their breast and white barring on flanks when plumage is fresh. The older the feathers get the less the black bars may appear leaving the breast dark redish. The crown and the back are a mix of brown, black and buff markings. Wings and upper-back are mottled with black, buff, and white markings looking overall dark brown.

When in the winter plumage the long-billed dowitcher is very difficult to identify in the field with the short-billed dowitcher. In non-breeding plumage, adults are drab grey, with darker upperparts and breast contrasting with paler white belly. The gray of the breast also gradually lightens as it reaches the chin.

The juvenile plumage of the long-billed dowitcher is similar to that of the breeding adult except for being paler. Juvenile long-billed dowitcher can be distinguished from the short-billed dowitcher by the differences in the tertiary feathers. On the long-billed dowitcher these feathers are dark gray with narrow buff edges with internal markings so dull they seem to lack them altogether. In juvenile birds the upper parts are fringed chestnut rather than buffy brown and their uniformly gray breast is slightly demarcated from the pale rufous lower belly and breasts.

The bill of the long-billed dowitcher ranges from 62 mm to 72 mm with males having bill lengths near the smaller scale reflecting their smaller body size. Bills are typically very straight and black becoming yellowish olive-green near the base and legs are also yellowish. Sexes are almost identical, with females being generally heavier and having longer wings and bill.

== Habitat and distribution ==

=== Breeding ===
In North America, the long-billed dowitcher breeds mainly throughout western and northern Alaska along the coast from Hooper Bay to w. Mackenzie and south to the foothills of Brooks Range. In this range, while nesting it greatly prefers wet, grass or sedge freshwater meadows but it is also sometimes confined to marshes and will move to lakes, ponds, or estuaries to forage after nesting. In eastern Siberia it breeds from the lower Yana River to Chukotka Peninsula and Anadyr Lowlands with an apparent westward expansion in Russia, also commonly nesting along Bering Sea and inland along rivers draining into the East Arctic Sea of Siberia.

=== Non-breeding ===
During the non-breeding season, its range has been difficult to determine due to its similarity to Short-billed dowitchers in winter plumage, especially in areas where both species overlap in which case most birds are identified as &quot;dowitchers&quot;. Along the Pacific coast however, it winters in various locations from south-western British Columbia to Baja California, also moving inland to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and south to Mexico. Along the Atlantic coast, it winters from North Carolina to Florida, also moving west along the Gulf Coast to Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. In the winter, this bird can be found in a much larger variety of habitats ranging from mudflats, flooded wetlands, wet meadows and fields to various lakes and marshes preferring water less than three inches deep. In general, long-billed dowitchers seem to prefer fresh over salt water and muddy over sandy habitats in comparison to short-billed dowitchers.

===Migration===
The long-billed dowitcher will migrate later in the fall than the short-billed dowitcher and earlier in the spring. The spring migrations occurs from February to May with birds moving up along the Pacific coast and interior. The long-billed dowitcher will also migrate through the Great Plains on the western side with a vast majority moving through Alberta.

The fall migrations generally occurs from July to October with the adult long-billed dowitcher beginning to migrate south in July while juveniles begin migrating through September to October. From their breeding grounds the long-billed dowitcher will either migrate south along the Pacific Coast, across the Canadian Prairies and down the Great Basin or through Ontario towards Florida.

== Behaviour ==

=== Diet and foraging ===

Long-billed dowitchers forage by jabbing or probing with a characteristic &quot;sewing machine&quot; motion in shallow water or on wet mud, often with their heads underwater and using tactile receptors on the tip of their bill to locate prey by touch. The long-billed dowitcher, during breeding, consumes large quantities of chironomidae larva and larva of other insects with occasional plant matter and seeds. During migration and in their wintering region, the long-billed dowitcher consumes a far greater range of food types. Dowitchers eat everything from polychaetes to insect larva to crustaceans to mollusks. Also, having night vision, they are known to forage at night during migration.

=== Vocalization ===
The long-billed dowitcher&#x27;s main call, mostly heard in flight but also while on ground, is a high, sharp &quot;keek&quot; sometimes repeated as an accelerating quick double or triple note series. Its second, less common call is a &quot;tu&quot; given 1-8 times. Its song is described as &quot;pee-witch-er&quot;, and its alarm call is an explosive &quot;KEEK.&quot; The long-billed dowitcher is a more vocal shorebird often making a &quot;keek&quot; or &quot;tu&quot; call, heard when in feeding flocks unlike the short-billed dowitcher which are generally silent on the ground.

=== Reproduction ===
Male long-billed dowitcher will court females by first singing to them and then compete with other males by pursuing the female in flight, displaying an aerial show of speed and agility. After mating, they are known to sing while hovering 15 feet in the air above their territories. Pairs are generally monogamous for a breeding season, but do not retain the same mate for multiple years. Long-billed dowitchers nest in wet areas of tall grasses in the troughs of raised mounds and ridges. The nest is a simple depression in the ground usually lined with grass and leaves.

The long-billed dowitcher lays an average four eggs per brood. The eggs are oval to pear shaped and range from being a buff olive to a greenish or blueish glaucous. The eggs are also heavily splotched with varying shades of brown near the base of the large end with the underlying marks being dark gray. Incubation of the eggs is approximately twenty days in which both sexes participate. Long-billed dowitcher chicks are precocial and downy being able to feed themselves within a few hours of hatching; the male parent looks after the chicks until they have fledged.

<text>Thor (from ) is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. In Norse mythology, he is a hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the protection of humankind, hallowing, and fertility. Besides Old Norse , the deity occurs in Old English as &#x27;, in Old Frisian as , in Old Saxon as , and in Old High German as &#x27;, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym , meaning &#x27;Thunder&#x27;.

Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, from the Roman occupation of regions of , to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period, to his high popularity during the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia, emblems of his hammer, , were worn and Norse pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.

Narratives featuring Thor are most prominently attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears throughout Norse mythology. In stories recorded in medieval Iceland, Thor bears at least fifteen names, is the husband of the golden-haired goddess and the lover of the . With , Thor fathered the goddess (and possible valkyrie) ; with , he fathered ; with a mother whose name is not recorded, he fathered , and he is the stepfather of the god . Thor is the son of Odin and Jörð, by way of his father Odin, he has numerous brothers, including . Thor has two servants, and, rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats, and (whom he eats and resurrects), and is ascribed three dwellings (, , and ). Thor wields the hammer , wears the belt and the iron gloves , and owns the staff . Thor&#x27;s exploits, including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent —and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of —are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology.

Into the modern period, Thor continued to be acknowledged in folklore throughout Germanic-speaking Europe. Thor is frequently referred to in place names, the day of the week Thursday bears his name (modern English &quot;Thursday&quot; derives from Old English , &#x27;Thunor&#x27;s day&#x27;), and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today, particularly in Scandinavia. Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in Heathenry.

==Name==
The name &quot;Thor&quot; is derived from Norse mythology. Its medieval Germanic equivalents or cognates are &#x27; (Old High German), &#x27; (Old English), &#x27; (Old Frisian), &#x27; (Old Saxon), and &quot;&quot; (Old Norse), the latter of which inspired the modern English form &quot;Thor&quot;.

=== Etymology ===
Though Old Norse &#x27; has only one syllable, it comes from an earlier Proto-Norse two-syllable form which can be reconstructed as *&#x27; (from an earlier *&#x27;) and/or *&#x27; (from *&quot;&quot;), evidenced by the poems &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; and &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot;, and modern Elfdalian &#x27;Thursday&#x27;, through the common Old Norse development of the sequence &quot;-unr-&quot; to &quot;-ór-&quot;.

All Germanic forms of Thor&#x27;s name descend from Proto-Germanic, but there is debate as to precisely what form the name took at that early stage. The form is suggested by Elfdalian (&#x27;Thursday&#x27;) and by a runic inscription from around 700 from Hallbjäns in Sundre, Gotland, which includes the sequence &quot;þunurþurus&quot;. Alternatively, the form is attractive because it is identical to the name of the ancient Celtic god &quot;Taranus&quot; (by metathesis–switch of sounds–of an earlier , attested in the dative &quot;tanaro&quot; and the Gaulish river name &quot;Tanarus&quot;). Finally, the form has also been suggested by Hjalmar Lindroth (1917) and has the attraction of clearly containing the sequence &quot;-unr-&quot;, needed to explain the later form &quot;Þórr&quot;, although the similarity with Celtic theonym *&quot;Tonaros&quot; is lost. According to John T. Koch, the form is from earlier pre-Germanic stage that predates Grim&#x27;s Law.

These Proto-Germanic forms are probably further related to the common Proto-Indo-European root for &#x27;thunder&#x27; , also attested in the Latin epithet &quot;Tonans&quot; (attached to Jupiter) and the Vedic &quot;stanáyati&quot; (&quot;thunders&quot;). Scholar Peter Jackson argues that those theonyms may have emerged as the result of the fossilization of an original epithet (or epiclesis, i.e. invocational name) of the Proto-Indo-European thunder-god , since the Vedic weather-god Parjanya is also called (&#x27;Thunderer&#x27;).

The potentially perfect match between the thunder-gods *&quot;Tonaros&quot; and *&quot;Þunaraz&quot;, which both go back to a common form *&quot;ton(a)ros&quot; ~ *&quot;tṇros&quot;, is notable in the context of early Celtic–Germanic linguistic contacts, especially when added to other inherited terms with thunder attributes, such as *&quot;Meldunjaz&quot;–*&quot;meldo-&quot; (from *&quot;meldh&quot;- &#x27;lightning, hammer&#x27;, i.e. &#x27; weapon) and *&quot;Fergunja&quot;–*&quot;Fercunyā&quot; (from &#x27;wooded mountains&#x27;, i.e. *Perkwunos&#x27; realm).

=== Name of the weeks ===
The English weekday name &quot;Thursday&quot; comes from Old English &quot;Þunresdæg&quot;, meaning &#x27;day of Þunor&#x27;, with influence from Old Norse &quot;Þórsdagr&quot;. The name is cognate with Old High German &quot;Donarestag&quot;. All of these terms derive from a Late Proto-Germanic weekday name along the lines of *&quot;Þunaresdagaz&quot; (&#x27;Day of &#x27;), a calque of Latin &#x27; (&#x27;Day of Jove&#x27;; cf. modern Italian &#x27;, French &#x27;, Spanish &#x27;). By employing a practice known as during the Roman period, ancient Germanic peoples adopted the Latin weekly calendar and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own.

=== Personal names ===
Beginning in the Viking Age, personal names containing the theonym are recorded with great frequency, whereas no examples are known prior to this period. -based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, similar to the widespread Viking Age practice of wearing Thor&#x27;s hammer pendants.

==Historical attestations==
===Roman era===

The earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Thor is frequently referred to – via a process known as (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) – as either the Roman god Jupiter (also known as &quot;Jove&quot;) or the Greco-Roman god Hercules.

The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian Tacitus&#x27;s late first-century work , where, writing about the religion of the (a confederation of Germanic peoples), he comments that &quot;among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims. Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind&quot; and adds that a portion of the also venerate &quot;Isis&quot;. In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god Odin as &quot;Mercury&quot;, Thor as &quot;Hercules&quot;, and the god as &quot;Mars&quot;, and the identity of the Isis of the Suebi has been debated. In Thor&#x27;s case, the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor&#x27;s hammer and Hercules&#x27; club. In his &quot;Annals&quot;, Tacitus again refers to the veneration of &quot;Hercules&quot; by the Germanic peoples; he records a wood beyond the river Weser (in what is now northwestern Germany) as dedicated to him. A deity known as Hercules Magusanus was venerated in Germania Inferior; due to the Roman identification of Thor with Hercules, Rudolf Simek has suggested that &quot;Magusanus&quot; was originally an epithet attached to the Proto-Germanic deity *&quot;Þunraz&quot;.

===Post-Roman era===

The first recorded instance of the name of the god appears upon the Nordendorf fibulae, a piece of jewelry created during the Migration Period and found in Bavaria. The item bears an Elder Futhark inscribed with the name (i.e. ), the southern Germanic form of Thor&#x27;s name.

Around the second half of the 8th century, Old English texts mention (), which likely refers to a Saxon version of the god. In relation, is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss &quot;Jupiter&quot;, the god may be referenced in the poem &quot;Solomon and Saturn&quot;, where the thunder strikes the devil with a &quot;fiery axe&quot;, and the Old English expression (&quot;thunder ride&quot;) may refer to the god&#x27;s thunderous, goat-led chariot.

A 9th-century AD codex from Mainz, Germany, known as the &quot;Old Saxon Baptismal Vow&quot;, records the name of three Old Saxon gods, (Old Saxon &quot;Wodan&quot;), , and , by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally converting to Christianity.

According to a near-contemporary account, the Christian missionary Saint Boniface felled an oak tree dedicated to &quot;Jove&quot; in the 8th century, the Donar&#x27;s Oak in the region of Hesse, Germany.

The Kentish royal legend, probably 11th-century, contains the story of a villainous reeve of Ecgberht of Kent called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as (Old English &#x27;Thunor&#x27;s mound&#x27;). Gabriel Turville-Petre saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god&#x27;s name.

===Viking age===
In the 11th century, chronicler Adam of Bremen records in his that a statue of Thor, who Adam describes as &quot;mightiest&quot;, sits in the Temple at Uppsala in the center of a triple throne (flanked by Woden and &quot;Fricco&quot;) located in , Sweden. Adam details that &quot;Thor, they reckon, rules the sky; he governs thunder and lightning, winds and storms, fine weather and fertility&quot; and that &quot;Thor, with his mace, looks like Jupiter&quot;. Adam details that the people of had appointed priests to each of the gods, and that the priests were to offer up sacrifices. In Thor&#x27;s case, he continues, these sacrifices were done when plague or famine threatened. Earlier in the same work, Adam relays that in 1030 an English preacher, Wulfred, was lynched by assembled Germanic pagans for &quot;profaning&quot; a representation of Thor.

Two objects with runic inscriptions invoking Thor date from the 11th century, one from England and one from Sweden. The first, the Canterbury Charm from Canterbury, England, calls upon Thor to heal a wound by banishing a . The second, the Kvinneby amulet, invokes protection by both Thor and his hammer.

On four (or possibly five) runestones, an invocation to Thor appears that reads &quot;May Thor hallow (these runes/this monument)!&quot; The invocation appears thrice in Denmark (DR 110, DR 209, and DR 220), and a single time in (VG 150), Sweden. A fifth appearance may possibly occur on a runestone found in , Sweden (Sö 140), but the reading is contested.

Pictorial representations of Thor&#x27;s hammer appear on a total of five runestones found in Denmark (DR 26 and DR 120) and in the Swedish counties of (VG 113) and (Sö 86 and Sö 111). It is also seen on runestone DR 48. The design is believed to be a heathen response to Christian runestones, which often have a cross at the centre. One of the stones, Sö 86, shows a face or mask above the hammer. Anders Hultgård has argued that this is the face of Thor. At least three stones depict Thor fishing for the serpent : the stone in , Denmark, the Altuna Runestone in , Sweden and the Gosforth Cross in Gosforth, England. Sune Lindqvist argued in the 1930s that the image stone Ardre VIII on depicts two scenes from the story: Thor ripping the head of Hymir&#x27;s ox and Thor and Hymir in the boat, but this has been disputed.

===Post-Viking age===
In the 12th century, more than a century after Norway was &quot;officially&quot; Christianized, Thor was still being invoked by the population, as evidenced by a stick bearing a runic message found among the Bryggen inscriptions in Bergen, Norway. On the stick, both Thor and Odin are called upon for help; Thor is asked to &quot;receive&quot; the reader, and Odin to &quot;own&quot; them.

====&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;====
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled during the 13th century from traditional source material reaching into the pagan period, Thor appears (or is mentioned) in the poems , , , , , , , , and .
In the poem , a dead recounts the history of the universe and foretells the future to the disguised god Odin, including the death of Thor. Thor, she foretells, will do battle with the great serpent during the immense mythic war waged at , and there he will slay the monstrous snake, yet after he will only be able to take nine steps before succumbing to the venom of the beast:
Afterwards, says the , the sky will turn black before fire engulfs the world, the stars will disappear, flames will dance before the sky, steam will rise, the world will be covered in water and then it will be raised again, green and fertile.

In the poem , the god Odin, in disguise as , and tortured, starved and thirsty, imparts in the young cosmological lore, including that Thor resides in , and that, every day, Thor wades through the rivers and, and the two . There, says, Thor sits as judge at the immense cosmological world tree, .

In , the god &#x27;s messenger, , threatens the fair , with whom is smitten, with numerous threats and curses, including that Thor, , and Odin will be angry with her, and that she risks their &quot;potent wrath&quot;.

Thor is the main character of , where, after traveling &quot;from the east&quot;, he comes to an inlet where he encounters a ferryman who gives his name as (Odin, again in disguise), and attempts to hail a ride from him. The ferryman, shouting from the inlet, is immediately rude and obnoxious to Thor and refuses to ferry him. At first, Thor holds his tongue, but only becomes more aggressive, and the poem soon becomes a match between Thor and , all the while revealing lore about the two, including Thor&#x27;s killing of several in &quot;the east&quot; and women on (now the Danish island of ). In the end, Thor ends up walking instead.

Thor is again the main character in the poem , where, after the gods have been hunting and have eaten their prey, they have an urge to drink. They &quot;sh[ake] the twigs&quot; and interpret what they say. The gods decide that they would find suitable cauldrons at &#x27;s home. Thor arrives at &#x27;s home and finds him to be cheerful, looks into his eyes, and tells him that he must prepare feasts for the gods. Annoyed, tells Thor that the gods must first bring to him a suitable cauldron to brew ale in. The gods search but find no such cauldron anywhere. However, tells Thor that he may have a solution; east of lives , and he owns such a deep kettle.

So, after Thor secures his goats at &#x27;s home, Thor and go to &#x27;s hall in search of a cauldron large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After —who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, &#x27;s mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs that he wants to go fishing the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds &#x27;s best ox, and rips its head off.

After a lacuna in the manuscript of the poem, abruptly picks up again with Thor and in a boat, out at sea. catches a few whales at once, and Thor baits his line with the head of the ox. Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent bites. Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in the manuscript.

After the second lacuna, is sitting in the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, suggests that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to &#x27;s farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at &#x27;s head on &#x27;s mother&#x27;s suggestion, Thor and are given the cauldron. cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from &#x27;s home, an army of many-headed beings led by attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to &#x27;s for more every winter.

In the poem , the half-god Loki angrily flites with the gods in the sea entity &#x27;s hall. Thor does not attend the event, however, as he is away in the east for unspecified purposes. Towards the end of the poem, the flyting turns to , Thor&#x27;s wife, whom Loki then claims to have slept with. The god &#x27;s servant interjects, and says that, since all of the mountains are shaking, she thinks that Thor is on his way home. adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel, to which Loki responds with insults.

Thor arrives and tells Loki to be silent, and threatens to rip Loki&#x27;s head from his body with his hammer. Loki asks Thor why he is so angry, and comments that Thor will not be so daring to fight &quot;the wolf&quot; () when it eats Odin (a reference to the foretold events of ). Thor again tells him to be silent, and threatens to throw him into the sky, where he will never be seen again. Loki says that Thor should not brag of his time in the east, as he once crouched in fear in the thumb of a glove (a story involving deception by the magic of , recounted in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book )—which, he comments, &quot;was hardly like Thor&quot;. Thor again tells him to be silent, threatening to break every bone in Loki&#x27;s body. Loki responds that he intends to live a while yet, and again insults Thor with references to his encounter with . Thor responds with a fourth call to be silent, and threatens to send Loki to . At Thor&#x27;s final threat, Loki gives in, commenting that only for Thor will he leave the hall, for &quot;I know alone that you do strike&quot;, and the poem continues.

In the comedic poem , Thor again plays a central role. In the poem, Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, , is missing. Thor turns to Loki, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two go to the dwelling of the goddess , and so that he may attempt to find , Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak. agrees, and says she would lend it to Thor even if it were made of silver or gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.

In , the sits on a barrow, plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the and the elves; why is Loki alone in ? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the —that Thor&#x27;s hammer, , is gone. says that he has hidden eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved, but only if is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from and back to the court of the gods.

Thor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he is still in the air as &quot;tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.&quot; Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless is brought to as his wife. The two return to and tell her to put on a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to . , indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed , falls from her. pointedly refuses.

As a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god puts forth the suggestion that, in place of , Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women&#x27;s clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace . Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects that this will be the only way to get back . Loki points out that, without , the will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to together.

After riding together in Thor&#x27;s goat-driven chariot, the two, disguised, arrive in . commands the in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for has arrived to be his wife. recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that was all that he was missing in his wealth.

Early in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with and the assembled . Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. finds the behavior at odds with his impression of , and Loki, sitting before and appearing as a &quot;very shrewd maid&quot;, makes the excuse that &quot;&#x27;s&quot; behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. then lifts &quot;&#x27;s&quot; veil and wants to kiss &quot;her&quot;. Terrifying eyes stare back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki says that this is because &quot;&quot; has not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.

The &quot;wretched sister&quot; of the appears, asks for a bridal gift from &quot;&quot;, and the bring out to &quot;sanctify the bride&quot;, to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by &quot;the hand&quot; of the goddess . Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes , beats all of the , kills their &quot;older sister&quot;, and so gets his hammer back.

In the poem , Thor tricks a dwarf, , to his doom upon finding that he seeks to wed his daughter (unnamed, possibly ). As the poem starts, Thor meets a dwarf who talks about getting married. Thor finds the dwarf repulsive and, apparently, realizes that the bride is his daughter. Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone, and that the dwarf must seek his consent. To do so, Thor says, must tell him what he wants to know about all of the worlds that the dwarf has visited. In a long question and answer session, does exactly that; he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world, and gives an amount of cosmological lore.

However, the question and answer session turns out to be a ploy by Thor, as, although Thor comments that he has truly never seen anyone with more wisdom in their breast, Thor has managed to delay the dwarf enough for the Sun to turn him to stone; &quot;day dawns on you now, dwarf, now sun shines on the hall&quot;.

In the poem , offers to the woman to (sacrifice) to Thor so that she may be protected, and comments that Thor does not care much for women.

====&quot;Prose Edda&quot;, , and sagas====
The prologue to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; euhemerises Thor as a prince of Troy, and the son of Menon by Troana, a daughter of . Thor, also known as , is said to have married the prophetess Sibyl (identified with ). Thor is further said here to have been raised in Thrace by a chieftain named Lorikus, whom he later slew to assume the title of &quot;King of Thrace&quot;, to have had a pale complexion and hair &quot;fairer than gold&quot;, and to have been strong enough to lift ten bearskins. In later sagas he is described as red-bearded, but there is no evidence for a red beard in the Eddas.

The name of the is explained as &quot;men from Asia&quot;, &quot;Asgard&quot; being the &quot;Asian city&quot; (i.e., Troy). Alternatively, Troy is in (Turkey, i.e., Asia Minor), and &quot;Asialand&quot; is Scythia, where Thor founded a new city named Asgard. Odin is a remote descendant of Thor, removed by twelve generations, who led an expedition across Germany, Denmark and Sweden to Norway.

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Thor is mentioned in all four books; &quot;Prologue&quot;, , , and .

In , composed in the 13th century by , Thor or statues of Thor are mentioned in , , , and . In chapter 5, a heavily euhemerized account of the gods is provided, where Thor is described as having been a —a pagan priest—who was given by Odin (who himself is explained away as having been an exceedingly powerful magic-wielding chieftain from the east) a dwelling in the mythical location of , in what is now Sweden. The saga narrative adds that numerous names—at the time of the narrative, popularly in use—were derived from &quot;Thor&quot;.

====Saint Olaf====

Around the 12th century, folk traditions and iconography of the Christianizing king Olaf II of Norway (Saint Olaf; c. 995 – 1030) absorbed elements of both Thor and Freyr. After Olaf&#x27;s death, his cult had spread quickly all over Scandinavia, where many churches were dedicated to him, as well as to other parts of Northern Europe. His cult distinctively mixed both ecclesiastical and folk elements. From Thor, he inherited the quick temper, physical strength and merits as a giant-slayer. Early depictions portray Olaf as clean-shaven, but after 1200 he appears with a red beard. For centuries, Olaf figured in folk traditions as a slayer of trolls and giants, and as a protector against malicious forces.

===Modern folklore===
Tales about Thor, or influenced by native traditions regarding Thor, continued into the modern period, particularly in Scandinavia. Writing in the 19th century, scholar Jacob Grimm records various phrases surviving into Germanic languages that refer to the god, such as the Norwegian (&quot;Thor&#x27;s warmth&quot;) for lightning and the Swedish (&quot;The good old (fellow) is taking a ride&quot;) as well as the word (&quot;Thor&#x27;s rumble&quot; or &quot;Thor&#x27;s thunder&quot;) when it thunders. Grimm comments that, at times, Scandinavians often &quot;no longer liked to utter the god&#x27;s real name, or they wished to extol his fatherly goodness&quot;. In Sweden, it was probably as a euphemism that people referred to thunder as &quot;the ride of the god&quot; – *&quot;ās-ækia&quot; (OWN: *&quot;áss-ekja&quot;) resulting in the modern Swedish word for thunder – &quot;&quot;.

Thor remained pictured as a red-bearded figure, as evident by the Danish rhyme that yet referred to him as (&quot;Thor with his long beard&quot;) and the North-Frisian curse (&quot;let red-haired thunder see to that!&quot;).

A Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of Thor&#x27;s role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and ettins in modern Scandinavia is explained as a result of the &quot;accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes&quot;.

In the Netherlands, The Sagas of Veluwe has a story called &quot;Ontstaan van het Uddeler- en Bleeke meer&quot; which features Thor and his fight with the Winter Giants.

==Archaeological record==
===Hammer pendants, hammer coins, and Eyrarland Statue===

Around 1000 pendants in distinctive shapes representing the hammer of Thor have been unearthed in what are today the Nordic countries, England, northern Germany, the Baltic countries, and Russia. Most have very simple designs in iron or silver. Around 100 have more advanced designs with ornaments. The pendants have been found in a variety of contexts (including at urban sites, and in hoards) and occur in a variety of shapes. Similarly, coins featuring depictions of the hammer have also been discovered.

The Eyrarland Statue, a copper alloy figure found near , Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.

===Swastikas===
The swastika symbol has been identified as representing the hammer or lightning of Thor. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson (1965) comments on the usage of the swastika as a symbol of Thor:

The protective sign of the hammer was worn by women, as we know from the fact that it has been found in women&#x27;s graves. It seems to have been used by the warrior also, in the form of the swastika. ... Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor&#x27;s association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When we find it on the pommel of a warrior&#x27;s sword and on his sword-belt, the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God&#x27;s protection.
Swastikas appear on various Germanic objects stretching from the Migration Period to the Viking Age, such as the 3rd century Fibula (DR EM85;123) from Zealand, Denmark; the Gothic spearhead from Brest-Litovsk, Belarus; numerous Migration Period bracteates; cremation urns from early Anglo-Saxon England; the 8th century sword from , Norway; and the 9th century Snoldelev Stone (DR 248) from , Denmark.

==Eponymy and toponymy==

Numerous place names in Scandinavia contain the Old Norse name . The identification of these place names as pointing to religious significance is complicated by the aforementioned common usage of as a personal name element. Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements (signifying the location of a , a type of pagan Germanic shrine), (a structure used for religious purposes, see heathen hofs), and (a holy grove). The place name is recorded with particular frequency in Denmark (and has direct cognates in Norse settlements in Ireland, such as ), whereas appears particularly often in southern Norway. (&quot;Thor&#x27;s Island&quot;) appears on the Swedish west coast. Thor also appears in many place names in Uppland.

In English place names, Old English (in contrast with the Old Norse form of the name, later introduced to the Danelaw) left comparatively few traces. Examples include Thundersley, from * and &quot;Thurstable&quot; (Old English &quot;Thunor&#x27;s pillar&quot;). F. M. Stenton noted that such place names were apparently restricted to Saxon and Jutish territory and not found in Anglian areas.

In what is now Germany, locations named after Thor are sparsely recorded, but a number of locations called (German &quot;Donner&#x27;s mountain&quot;) may derive their name from the deity , the southern Germanic form of the god&#x27;s name.
In as late as the 19th century in Iceland, a specific breed of fox was known as (&quot;Thor of the holt&quot;), likely due to the red coat of the breed. In Sweden in the 19th century, smooth, wedge-shaped stones found in the earth were called (&quot;Thor&#x27;s wedges&quot;), according to a folk belief that they were once hurled at a troll by the god Thor. (Compare Thunderstones.) Similarly, meteorites may be considered memorials to Thor in folk tradition due to their sheer weight. On the Swedish island of Gotland, a species of beetle (&quot;Scarabæus stercorarius&quot;) was named after the god; the . When the beetle is found turned upside down and one flips it over, Thor&#x27;s favor may be gained. In other regions of Sweden the name of the beetle appears to have been demonized with Christianization, where the insect came to be known as or (both meaning &quot;Thor-devil&quot;).

In the northwest of Spain, there is a river called Torío in the municipality of Cármenes (León) that take name from the god Thor.

==Origin, theories, and interpretations==
Thor closely resembles other Indo-European deities associated with the thunder: the Celtic Taranis, the Estonian Taara (or Tharapita), the Baltic , the Slavic Perun, and particularly the Hindu , whose thunderbolt weapon the is an obvious parallels noted already by Max Müller. Scholars have compared Indra&#x27;s slaying of with Thor&#x27;s battle with . Although in the past it was suggested that Thor was an indigenous sky god or a Viking Age import into Scandinavia, these Indo-European parallels make him generally accepted today as ultimately derived from a Proto-Indo-European deity.

In &#x27;s trifunctional hypothesis of Indo-European religion, Thor represents the second function, that of strength. notes that as a result of displacements, he does not lead armies; most of the functions of Indra have been in effect taken over by Odin. Many scholars have noted the association of Thor with fertility, particularly in later folklore and in the reflex of him represented by the Sami (&quot;Good-man Thor&quot;). For , this is the preservation by peasants of only the side-effect of the god&#x27;s atmospheric battles: the fertilizing rain. Others have emphasized Thor&#x27;s close connection to humanity, in all its concerns. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson summarizes:

The cult of Thor was linked with men&#x27;s habitation and possessions, and with the well-being of the family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor&#x27;s marriage with of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.
==Modern influence==


In modern times, Thor continues to be referred to in art and fiction. Starting with &#x27;s 1776 ode to Thor, , Thor has been the subject of poems in several languages, including &#x27;s 1807 epic poem and, by the same author, three more poems (, , and ) collected in his 1819 ; (1859) by ; the 1820 satirical poem by ; (1832) by ; the poem by ; (1836) by ; (1915) by ; &#x27;s (published in , 1937); and (1977) by . In English he features for example in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Challenge of Thor&quot; (1863) and in two works by Rudyard Kipling: &quot;Letters of Travel: 1892–1913&quot; and &quot;Cold Iron&quot; in &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot;. L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Harold Shea&quot; met with Thor, as with other Norse gods, in the first of Shea&#x27;s many fantasy adventures.

Artists have also depicted Thor in painting and sculpture, including Henry Fuseli&#x27;s 1780 painting &quot;Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent&quot;; &#x27;s 1821–1822 statue &quot;Thor&quot;; B. E. Fogelberg&#x27;s 1844 marble statue &quot;Thor&quot;; Mårten Eskil Winge&#x27;s 1872 painting &quot;Thor&#x27;s Fight with the Giants&quot;; K. Ehrenberg&#x27;s 1883 drawing ; several illustrations by published in &#x27;s 1901 (&quot;Thor&quot;; ; ; ; ; ; ); J. C. Dollman&#x27;s 1909 drawings &quot;Thor and the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Sif and Thor&quot;; G. Poppe&#x27;s painting &quot;Thor&quot;; &#x27;s 1914 drawing ; H. Natter&#x27;s marble statue &quot;Thor&quot;; and U. Brember&#x27;s 1977 illustrations to by .

In the fields of science and technology, Swedish chemist (1779–1848) discovered a chemical element that he named after Thor – thorium. Thor is also the namesake of the PGM-17 Thor missile.

In 1962, American comic book artist Jack Kirby, Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and his brother Larry Lieber created a feature in the comic book &quot;Journey Into Mystery&quot;, a series featuring Thor as a superhero. This version of Thor is portrayed as a clean-shaven blonde, instead of red-haired and bearded. The magazine soon added the backup feature &quot;Tales of Asgard&quot; in which Kirby illustrated stories from Norse mythology; eventually, the magazine was retitled &quot;Thor&quot;. Lee and Kirby included Thor as a founding member of their superhero team the Avengers. Thor has been portrayed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, appearing in &quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, &quot;Team Thor&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Thor has also been featured in comic books by other publishers. In the Savage Dragon comics, Thor is portrayed as a villain. In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; comic, Thor is portrayed as a buffoon who wields a tiny toffee hammer.

First described in 2013, Thor&#x27;s hero shrew (&quot;Scutisorex thori&quot;) is a species of shrew native to the Democratic Republic of Congo. It and its sister species, the hero shrew (&quot;Scutisorex somereni&quot;), are the only mammal species known to have interlocking vertebrae. The team named the shrew after Thor due to the god&#x27;s association with strength.

From 2015 to 2017, a fictionalised version of Thor was a supporting character in &quot;Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard&quot;, a trilogy of fantasy novels written by American author Rick Riordan and published by Disney-Hyperion, set in the same fictional universe as the &quot;Camp Half-Blood Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;The Kane Chronicles&quot; series by the same author. Neil Gaiman&#x27;s books &quot;American Gods&quot; and &quot;Norse Mythology&quot; also feature Thor.

In January 2020, the streaming service Netflix produced &quot;Ragnarok&quot;. In the show, a high school student, Magne Seier, receives Thor&#x27;s powers and abilities to fight the giants that are polluting Norway and murdering people. Netflix released the second season on 27 May 2021. Thor/Magne is portrayed by David Stakston.

Thor is also featured in a number of video games. In the 2002 Ensemble Studios game &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, Thor is one of three major gods Norse players can worship. In Santa Monica Studio&#x27;s 2018 video game &quot;God of War&quot;, Thor is mentioned throughout and his sons Magni and Modi are secondary antagonists. Thor makes an appearance at the end of the main storyline if certain difficulty conditions are met by the player. He makes a much more substantial appearance in the game&#x27;s 2022 sequel &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot; as a primary antagonist, played by Ryan Hurst. Thor is also mentioned in Ubisoft&#x27;s 2020 game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;, where items of his such as Mjölnir can be found and used by the player in combat. Thor is also one of the playable gods in the third-person multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;Smite&quot;.

<text>The flag of the U.S state of Kansas was adopted in 1927. The elements of the state flag include the Kansas state seal and a sunflower. This original design was modified in 1961 to add the name of the state at the bottom of the flag.

== Official description ==
The official flag of Kansas is represented by a dark-blue silk rectangle representing Kansas arranged horizontally with the state seal aligned in the center. Above the seal is a sunflower which sits over a bar of gold and light blue. Below the seal is printed the name of the state &quot;KANSAS&quot;.

==Seal of Kansas==

The state seal centered on the flag tells the history of Kansas and his figures representing pioneer life. The seal contains:
* Landscape with a rising sun (the east)
* River and steamboat (commerce)
* Settler&#x27;s cabin and a man plowing a field (agriculture) [foreground]
* Wagon train heading west (American expansion)
* Indians hunting American Bison (the buffalo are fleeing from the Indians)
* Cluster of 34 stars (top of the seal, representing Kansas&#x27;s admission as the 34th state)
* State motto &quot;&quot; - Latin : &quot;To the Stars through Difficulties&quot; (above the stars)
The thirty-four stars clustered at the top of the seal identify Kansas as the 34th state to be accepted into the Union of the United States. Kansas state law provides that the flag is to be used on all occasions when the state is officially represented.

== History ==

During Bleeding Kansas, an unknown party made a 31-star U.S. flag with the letter &quot;K&quot; in the top right of the canton. The &quot;K&quot; stood for Kansas and was flown when the area was still a territory. It is unknown whether the flag was used in support or opposition to slavery in the territory, but it is known that the party supported Kansas statehood.

In 1916, the Daughters of the American Revolution organised a contest to create a flag for Kansas. The winner was Esther Northrup of Lawrence, whose design consisted of three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue, with a gold sunflower on a blue background in the canton, and the state seal in the center of the sunflower. The proposed flag was submitted to the Kansas legislature in 1917, but was ultimately not adopted.

The flag of Kansas was designed in 1925 by Hazel Avery and first used in a Fourth of July parade in Lincoln, Kansas. Officially adopted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1927 and modified in 1961 (the word &quot;Kansas&quot; was added below the seal in gold block lettering). First flown at Fort Riley by Governor Benjamin S. Paulen in 1927 for the troops at Fort Riley and for the Kansas National Guard.

From 1925 to 1927, Kansas used a &quot;state banner&quot; instead of a flag. The Kansas state banner, which consisted of a large sunflower and the word &quot;Kansas&quot; on a blue field, was intended to be hung from a horizontal bar, rather than a vertical flag pole. It was given a unique design to avoid &quot;competition&quot; with the United States flag. However, after the banner was rejected for display in Washington, D.C., and generated complaints for its awkward method of hanging, the state legislature adopted a state flag that saw the addition of the word &quot;Kansas&quot; at the bottom in 1961 but has otherwise retained its original design.

According to the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA), the state banner exists today as an official alternative to the state flag. The organization&#x27;s website features the banner – a lone sunflower on a blue field – and attributes it to Adjutant General Joe Nickell. However, the Kansas State Historical Society describes the same design as a flag submitted by Albert T. Reid before the state banner was adopted, and makes no mention of its status as an alternative flag.

<doc id="316353" wikidata="Q1193167" url="?curid=316353" title="Nakahama Manjirō">
<text>, also known as John Manjirō (or John Mung), was a Japanese samurai and translator who was one of the first Japanese people to visit the United States and an important translator during the opening of Japan.

He was a fisherman before his journey to the United States, where he studied English and navigation and became a sailor and gold miner. After returning to Japan, he was elevated to the status of a samurai and was made a &quot;hatamoto&quot;. He served his country as an interpreter and translator and was instrumental in negotiating the Convention of Kanagawa. He also taught as a professor at the Tokyo Imperial University.

==Voyage to America==

During his early life, he lived as a simple fisherman in the village of Naka-no-hama, Tosa Province (now Tosashimizu, Kōchi Prefecture). In 1841, 14-year-old Nakahama Manjirō and four friends (four brothers named Goemon, Denzo, Toraemon, and Jusuke) were fishing when their boat was wrecked on the island of Torishima. The American whaleship &quot;John Howland&quot;, with Captain William H. Whitfield in command, rescued them. At the end of the voyage, four of them were left in Honolulu; however, Manjirō (nicknamed &quot;John Mung&quot;) wanted to stay on the ship. Captain Whitfield took him back to the United States and briefly entrusted him to his neighbor Ebenezer Akin, who enrolled Manjirō in the Oxford School in the town of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. The boy studied English and navigation for a year, apprenticed to a cooper, and then, with Whitfield&#x27;s help, signed on to the whaleship &quot;Franklin&quot; (Captain Ira Davis). After whaling in the South Seas, the &quot;Franklin&quot; put into Honolulu in October 1847, where Manjirō again met his four friends. None were able to return to Japan, for this was during Japan&#x27;s period of isolation, when leaving the country was an offense punishable by death.

When Captain Davis became mentally ill and was left in Manila, the crew elected a new captain, and Manjirō was made boatsteerer (harpooner). The &quot;Franklin&quot; returned to New Bedford, Massachusetts in September 1849 and paid off its crew; Manjirō was self-sufficient, with $350 (~$ in ) in his pocket.

Manjirō promptly set out by sea for the California Gold Rush. Arriving in San Francisco in May 1850, he took a steamboat up the Sacramento River, then went into the mountains. In a few months, he found enough gold to exchange for about 600 pieces of silver and decided to find a way back to Japan nearly a decade after being rescued from the island of Torishima.

==Return to Japan==
Manjirō arrived in Honolulu and found two of his companions were willing to go with him. Toraemon, who thought it would be too risky, did not voyage back to Japan, and Jusuke had died of a heart ailment. Manjirō purchased a whaleboat, the &quot;Adventure&quot;, which was loaded aboard the bark &quot;Sarah Boyd&quot; (Captain Whitmore) along with gifts from the people of Honolulu. They sailed on December 17, 1850, and reached Okinawa on February 2, 1851. The three were promptly taken into custody, although treated with courtesy. After months of questioning, they were released in Nagasaki and eventually returned home to Tosa where Lord Yamauchi Toyoshige awarded them pensions. Manjirō was appointed a minor official and became a valuable source of information.

In September 1853, Manjirō was summoned to Edo (now known as Tokyo), questioned by the shogunate government, and made a &quot;hatamoto&quot; (a samurai in direct service to the shōgun). He would now give interviews only in service to the government. In token of his new status, he would wear two swords, and needed a surname; he chose &quot;Nakahama&quot;, after his home village.

In 1861, Manjirō was ordered to join the shogunate&#x27;s expedition to the Bonin Islands, on which he acted as an interpreter.

==Service as a &quot;hatamoto&quot;==
Manjirō detailed his travels in a report to the Tokugawa Shogunate, which is kept today at the Tokyo National Museum. On July 8, 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s Black Ships arrived to force the opening of Japan, Manjirō became an interpreter and translator for the Shogunate and was instrumental in negotiating the Convention of Kanagawa.
However, it appears that he did not contact the Americans directly at that time.

In 1860, Nakahama Manjirō participated in the Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860). He was appointed translator on board &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;, Japan&#x27;s first screw-driven steam warship, purchased from the Dutch. Due to Japan&#x27;s former policy of isolation, the crew had little experience on the open ocean, and during a storm, her Captain Katsu Kaishū, Admiral Kimura Kaishū and much of the crew fell ill. Manjirō was put in charge and brought the ship to port safely.

In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, Manjirō studied military science in Europe. He returned to Japan by way of the United States. He was formally received at Washington D.C., and he took advantage of this opportunity by traveling overland to Fairhaven, Massachusetts to visit his &quot;foster father&quot;, Captain Whitfield. Eventually, Manjirō became a professor at the Tokyo Imperial University.

==Legacy==

Manjirō apparently used his knowledge of western shipbuilding to contribute to the effort of the Shogunate to build a modern navy. He translated Bowditch&#x27;s American Practical Navigator into Japanese, and taught English, naval tactics and whaling techniques. He allegedly contributed to the construction of the &quot;Shohei Maru&quot;, Japan&#x27;s first post-seclusion foreign-style warship.

Manjirō was married three times and had seven children. In 1918, his eldest son, Dr. Nakahama Toichirō, donated a valuable sword to Fairhaven in token of his father&#x27;s rescue and the kindness of the town. It continued to be displayed in the town library even during World War II when anti-Japanese sentiment was very high. After the sword was stolen in 1977, a replacement was gifted in 1982 and is still on display at the library.

Among his accomplishments, Manjirō was probably the first Japanese person to take a train, ride in a steamship, officer an American vessel, and command a trans-Pacific voyage.

There is a statue of Nakahama Manjirō at Cape Ashizuri, on Shikoku. However, his grave, formerly at the Zōshigaya Cemetery in Tokyo, was destroyed by American air raids in World War II. In Fairhaven, the Manjirō Historic Friendship Society renovated William Whitfield&#x27;s home to include a museum dealing with the Manjirō legacy.

Minor planet 4841 Manjiro is named after him.

Many books have been published about Manjiro&#x27;s life and journey, such as &quot;Heart of a Samurai&quot; by Margi Preus, &quot;Born in the Year of Courage&quot; by Emily Crofford, and &quot;Shipwrecked! The True Adventures of a Japanese Boy&quot; by Rhoda Blumberg.

A Manjiro Festival, sponsored by the Whitfield-Manjiro Friendship Society, is held in Fairhaven in early October of odd numbered years.

<doc id="316354" wikidata="Q957073" url="?curid=316354" title="Consonant cluster">
<text>In linguistics, a consonant cluster, consonant sequence or consonant compound, is a group of consonants which have no intervening vowel. In English, for example, the groups and are consonant clusters in the word &quot;splits&quot;. In the education field it is variously called a consonant cluster or a consonant blend.

Some linguists argue that the term can be properly applied only to those consonant clusters that occur within one syllable. Others claim that the concept is more useful when it includes consonant sequences across syllable boundaries. According to the former definition, the longest consonant clusters in the word &quot;extra&quot; would be and , whereas the latter allows , which is phonetically in some accents.

== Phonotactics ==

Each language has an associated set of phonotactic constraints. Languages&#x27; phonotactics differ as to what consonant clusters they permit. Many languages are more restrictive than English in terms of consonant clusters, and some forbid consonant clusters entirely.

For example, Hawaiian, like most Oceanic languages, forbids consonant clusters entirely. Japanese is almost as strict, but allows a sequence of a nasal consonant plus another consonant, as in (the name of the largest island of Japan). It also permits geminate /kk/, /pp/, /ss/, and /tt/. However, palatalized consonants, such as [kʲ] in , are single consonants. 

Standard Arabic forbids initial consonant clusters and more than two consecutive consonants in other positions, as do most other Semitic languages, although Modern Israeli Hebrew permits initial two-consonant clusters (e.g. &quot;cap&quot;; &quot;pumpkin&quot;), and Moroccan Arabic, under Berber influence, allows strings of several consonants. 

Like most Mon–Khmer languages, Khmer permits only initial consonant clusters with up to three consonants in a row per syllable. Finnish has initial consonant clusters natively only on South-Western dialects and on foreign loans, and only clusters of three inside the word are allowed. Most spoken languages and dialects, however, are more permissive. In Burmese, consonant clusters of only up to three consonants (the initial and two medials—two written forms of , ) at the initial onset are allowed in writing and only two (the initial and one medial) are pronounced; these clusters are restricted to certain letters. Some Burmese dialects allow for clusters of up to four consonants (with the addition of the medial, which can combine with the above-mentioned medials).

At the other end of the scale, the Kartvelian languages of Georgia are drastically more permissive of consonant clustering. Clusters in Georgian of four, five or six consonants are not unusual—for instance, (&quot;flat&quot;), (&quot;trainer&quot;) and (&quot;peeling&quot;)—and if grammatical affixes are used, it allows an eight-consonant cluster: (&quot;he&#x27;s plucking us&quot;), (&quot;you peel us&quot;). Consonants cannot appear as syllable nuclei in Georgian, so this syllable is analysed as CCCCCCCCVC. Many Slavic languages may manifest almost as formidable numbers of consecutive consonants, such as in the Czech tongue twister (), meaning &#x27;stick a finger through the neck&#x27;, the Slovak words (&quot;quarter&quot;), and (&quot;clunk&quot;; &quot;flop&quot;), and the Slovene word (&quot;welfare&quot;). However, the liquid consonants and can form syllable nuclei in West and South Slavic languages and behave phonologically as vowels in this case.

An example of a true initial cluster is the Polish word ( (&quot;you will initiate&quot;). In the Serbo-Croatian word (&quot;victualling&quot;) the and are digraphs representing single consonants: and , respectively. In Dutch, clusters of six or even seven consonants are possible (e.g. (&quot;a scream of fear&quot;), (&quot;writing the worst&quot;) and (&quot;treading the most softly&quot;)).

Some Salishan languages exhibit long words with no vowels at all, such as the Nuxálk word : &quot;he had had in his possession a bunchberry plant&quot;. It is extremely difficult to accurately classify which of these consonants may be acting as the syllable nucleus, and these languages challenge classical notions of exactly what constitutes a syllable. The same problem is encountered in the Northern Berber languages.

There has been a trend to reduce and simplify consonant clusters in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, such as Chinese and Vietnamese. Old Chinese was known to contain additional medials such as and/or , which yielded retroflexion in Middle Chinese and today&#x27;s Mandarin Chinese. The word , read in Mandarin and in Cantonese, is reconstructed as &quot;*klong&quot; or &quot;*krung&quot; in Old Chinese by Sinologists like Zhengzhang Shangfang, William H. Baxter, and Laurent Sagart. Additionally, initial clusters such as &quot;tk&quot; and &quot;sn&quot; were analysed in recent reconstructions of Old Chinese, and some were developed as palatalised sibilants. Similarly, in Thai, words with initial consonant clusters are commonly reduced in colloquial speech to pronounce only the initial consonant, such as the pronunciation of the word reducing from to .

Another element of consonant clusters in Old Chinese was analysed in coda and post-coda position. Some &quot;departing tone&quot; syllables have cognates in the &quot;entering tone&quot; syllables, which feature a -p, -t, -k in Middle Chinese and Southern Chinese varieties. The departing tone was analysed to feature a post-coda sibilant, &quot;s&quot;. Clusters of -ps, -ts, -ks, were then formed at the end of syllables. These clusters eventually collapsed into &quot;-ts&quot; or &quot;-s&quot;, before disappearing altogether, leaving elements of diphthongisation in more modern varieties. Old Vietnamese also had a rich inventory of initial clusters, but these were slowly merged with plain initials during Middle Vietnamese, and some have developed into the palatal nasal.

== Origin ==
Some consonant clusters originate from the loss of a vowel in between two consonants, usually (but not always) due to vowel reduction caused by lack of stress. This is also the origin of most consonant clusters in English, some of which go back to Proto-Indo-European times. For example, comes from Proto-Germanic *glo-, which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *gʰel-ó, where *gʰel- is a root meaning &#x27;to shine, to be bright&#x27; and is also present in , , and .

Consonant clusters can also originate from assimilation of a consonant with a vowel. In many Slavic languages, the combination mji, mje, mja etc. regularly gave mlji, mlje, mlja etc. Compare Russian , which had this change, with Polish , which lacks the change, both from Proto-Balto-Slavic *źemē. See Proto-Slavic language and History of Proto-Slavic for more information about this change.

== Clusters in languages ==
All languages differ in syllable structure and cluster template. A loanword from Adyghe in the extinct Ubykh language, (&#x27;to well up&#x27;), violates Ubykh&#x27;s limit of two initial consonants. The English words &quot;sphere&quot; and &quot;sphinx&quot; , Greek loanwords, break the rule that two fricatives may not appear adjacently word-initially. Some English words, including thrash, three, throat, and throw, start with the voiceless dental fricative /θ/, the liquid /r/, or the /r/ cluster (/θ/+/r/). This cluster example in Proto-Germanic has a counterpart in which /θ/ was followed by /l/. In early North and West Germanic, the /l/ cluster disappeared. This suggests that clusters are affected as words are loaned to other languages. The examples show that every language has syllable preference based on syllable structure and segment harmony of the language. Other factors that affect clusters when loaned to other languages include speech rate, articulatory factors, and speech perceptivity. Bayley has added that social factors such as age, gender, and geographical locations of speakers can determine clusters when they are loaned crosslinguistically.

== English ==
In English, the longest possible initial cluster is three consonants, as in &quot;split&quot; , &quot;strudel&quot; , &quot;strengths&quot; , and &quot;squirrel&quot; , all beginning with or , containing , , or , and ending with , , or ; the longest possible final cluster is five consonants, as in &quot;angsts&quot; (), though this is rare (perhaps owing to being derived from a recent German loanword). However, the in &quot;angsts&quot; may also be considered epenthetic; for many speakers, nasal-sibilant sequences in the coda require insertion of a voiceless stop homorganic to the nasal. For speakers without this feature, the word is pronounced without the . Final clusters of four consonants, as in &quot;angsts&quot; in other dialects (), &quot;twelfths&quot; , &quot;sixths&quot; , &quot;bursts&quot; (in rhotic accents) and &quot;glimpsed&quot; , are more common. Within compound words, clusters of five consonants or more are possible (if cross-syllabic clusters are accepted), as in &quot;handspring&quot; and in the Yorkshire place-name of &quot;Hampsthwaite&quot; .

It is important to distinguish clusters and digraphs. Clusters are made of two or more consonant &quot;sounds&quot;, while a digraph is a group of two consonant &quot;letters&quot; standing for a single sound. For example, in the word &quot;ship&quot;, the two letters of the digraph together represent the single consonant . Conversely, the letter can produce the consonant clusters (annex), (exist), (sexual), or (some pronunciations of &quot;luxury&quot;). It is worth noting that often produces sounds in two different syllables (following the general principle of saturating the subsequent syllable before assigning sounds to the preceding syllable). Also note a combination digraph and cluster as seen in &quot;length&quot; with two digraphs , representing a cluster of two consonants: (although it may be pronounced instead, as followed by a voiceless consonant in the same syllable often does); &quot;lights&quot; with a silent digraph followed by a cluster , : ; and compound words such as &quot;sightscreen&quot; or &quot;catchphrase&quot; .

== Frequency==
Not all consonant clusters are distributed equally among the languages of the world. Consonant clusters have a tendency to fall under patterns such as the sonority sequencing principle (SSP); the closer a consonant in a cluster is to the syllable&#x27;s vowel, the more sonorous the consonant is. Among the most common types of clusters are initial stop-liquid sequences, such as in Thai (e.g. , , and ). Other common ones include initial stop-approximant (e.g. Thai ) and initial fricative-liquid (e.g. English ) sequences. More rare are sequences which defy the SSP such as Proto-Indo-European and (which many of its descendants have, including English). Certain consonants are more or less likely to appear in consonant clusters, especially in certain positions. The Tsou language of Taiwan has initial clusters such as , which doesn&#x27;t violate the SSP, but nonetheless is unusual in having the labio-dental in the second position. The cluster is also rare, but occurs in Russian words such as ().

Consonant clusters at the ends of syllables are less common but follow the same principles. Clusters are more likely to begin with a liquid, approximant, or nasal and end with a fricative, affricate, or stop, such as in English &quot;world&quot; . Yet again, there are exceptions, such as English &quot;lapse&quot; .

<doc id="316356" wikidata="Q371633" url="?curid=316356" title="Short-billed dowitcher">
<text>The short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), like its congener the long-billed dowitcher, is a medium-sized, stocky, long-billed shorebird in the family Scolopacidae.

It is an inhabitant of North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. It is strongly migratory; it completely vacates in breeding areas during the snow-bound months. This species favors a variety of habitats including tundra in the north to ponds and mudflats in the south. It feeds on invertebrates often by rapidly probing its bill into mud in a sewing machine fashion. It and the very similar long-billed dowitcher were considered one species until 1950. Field identification of the two American &quot;Limnodromus&quot; remains difficult today. Distinguishing wintering or juvenile short-billed dowitchers from the long-billed species is very difficult and, even given examination their subtlety different body shapes, cannot always be isolated to a particular species. They differ most substantially in vocalizations. The names of American dowitchers are misleading, as there is much overlap in their bill lengths. Only a small percentage can be identified by this character alone.

==Taxonomy==
The short-billed dowitcher was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Scolopax grisea&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;brown snipe&quot; from the coast of New York that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham and by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. The short-billed dowitcher is now placed in the genus &quot;Limnodromus&quot; that was introduced in 1833 by Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;limnē&quot; meaning &quot;marsh&quot; with &quot;-dromos&quot; meaning &quot;-racer&quot; or &quot;-runner&quot;. The specific &quot;griseus&quot; is Medieval Latin meaning &quot;grey&quot;. The English name &quot;dowitcher&quot; is from Iroquois and was first recorded in 1841.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;L. g. caurinus&quot; Pitelka, 1950 – Breeds: Gulf of Alaska and inland central-south Alaska, southwest Yukon and montane northwest British Columbia (northwest Canada). Winters: central USA to Peru 
* &quot;L. g. hendersoni&quot; Rowan, 1932 – Breeds: central-north Alberta to west Manitoba (central Canada). Winters: southeast USA to Panama
* &quot;L. g. griseus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Breeds: southwest Hudson Bay and James Bay to west Labrador (central-east Canada). Winters: south USA to Brazil

==Description==
The body of adults is dark brown on top and reddish underneath. The tail has a black and white barred pattern. The legs are a yellowish color.

The three subspecies have slight variations in appearance:
* &quot;L. g. griseus&quot; has a white belly and barred flanks.
* &quot;L. g. hendersoni&quot; has a reddish belly and spotted flanks.
* &quot;L. g. caurinus&quot; has a white belly with heavily barred flanks and densely spotted breast.

None of these combines the reddish belly and barred flanks of the breeding plumage long-billed dowitcher. The winter plumage is largely grey. This bird can range from in length, in wingspan and in body mass.

The call of this bird is more mellow than that of the long-billed dowitcher, and is useful in identification, particularly of the difficult adult plumages.

==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding habitat of the short-billed dowitcher includes bogs, tidal marshes, mudflats or forest clearings south of the tree line in northern North America. &quot;L. g. griseus&quot; breeds in northern Quebec; &quot;L. g. hendersoni&quot; breeds in north central Canada; &quot;L. g. caurinus&quot; breeds in southern Alaska and southern Yukon.

The birds migrate to the southern United States and as far south as Brazil. This bird is more likely to be seen near ocean coasts during migration than the long-billed dowitcher. This species occurs in western Europe only as an extremely rare vagrant.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===
These birds nest on the ground, usually near water. Their nests are shallow depressions in clumps of grass or moss, which are lined with fine grasses, twigs and leaves. They lay four, sometimes three, olive-buff to brown eggs. Incubation lasts for 21 days and is done by both sexes.

The downy juvenile birds leave the nest soon after hatching. Parental roles are not well known, but it is believed the female departs and leaves the male to tend the chicks, which find all their own food.

===Food and feeding===
These birds forage by probing in shallow water or on wet mud. They mainly eat insects, mollusks, crustaceans and marine worms, but also eat some plant material.

<text>The , sometimes translated as The Chronicles of Japan, is the second-oldest book of classical Japanese history. The book is also called the . It is more elaborate and detailed than the , the oldest, and has proven to be an important tool for historians and archaeologists as it includes the most complete extant historical record of ancient Japan. The was finished in 720 under the editorial supervision of Prince Toneri with the assistance of Ō no Yasumaro and presented to Empress Genshō. The book is also a reflection of Chinese influence on Japanese civilization. In Japan, the Sinicized court wanted written history that could be compared with the annals of the Chinese. 

The begins with the Japanese creation myth, explaining the origin of the world and the first seven generations of divine beings (starting with Kuninotokotachi), and goes on with a number of myths as does the , but continues its account through to events of the 8th century. It is believed to record accurately the latter reigns of Emperor Tenji, Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. The focuses on the merits of the virtuous rulers as well as the errors of the bad rulers. It describes episodes from mythological eras and diplomatic contacts with other countries. The was written in classical Chinese, as was common for official documents at that time. The , on the other hand, is written in a combination of Chinese and phonetic transcription of Japanese (primarily for names and songs). The also contains numerous transliteration notes telling the reader how words were pronounced in Japanese. Collectively, the stories in this book and the are referred to as the Kiki stories.

The tale of Urashima Tarō is developed from the brief mention in (Emperor Yūryaku Year 22) that a certain child of Urashima visited Horaisan and saw wonders. The later tale has plainly incorporated elements from the famous anecdote of &quot;Luck of the Sea and Luck of the Mountains&quot; (Hoderi and Hoori) found in . The later developed Urashima tale contains the Rip Van Winkle motif, so some may consider it an early example of fictional time travel.

The first translation was completed by William George Aston in 1896 (English).

==Process of compilation==
=== Background ===
The background of the compilation of the is that Emperor Tenmu ordered 12 people, including Prince Kawashima, to edit the old history of the empire.

&quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; notes that &quot;&quot; in the part of May 720. It means &quot;Up to that time, Prince Toneri had been compiling &quot;Nihongi&quot; on the orders of the emperor; he completed it, submitting 30 volumes of history and one volume of genealogy&quot;.

===Sources===
The is a synthesis of older documents, specifically on the records that had been continuously kept in the Yamato court since the sixth century. It also includes documents and folklore submitted by clans serving the court. Prior to , there were &quot;Tennōki&quot; and &quot;Kokki&quot; compiled by Prince Shōtoku and Soga no Umako, but as they were stored in Soga&#x27;s residence, they were burned at the time of the Isshi Incident.

The work&#x27;s contributors refer to various sources which do not exist today. Among those sources, three Baekje documents (&quot;Kudara-ki&quot;, etc.) are cited mainly for the purpose of recording diplomatic affairs. Textual criticism shows that scholars fleeing the destruction of the Baekje to Yamato wrote these histories and the authors of the heavily relied upon those sources. This must be taken into account in relation to statements referring to old historic rivalries between the ancient Korean kingdoms of Silla, Goguryeo, and Baekje.

Some other sources are cited anonymously as &quot;aru fumi&quot; (; &quot;some document&quot;), in order to keep alternative records for specific incidents.

==Exaggeration of reign lengths==
Most scholars agree that the purported founding date of Japan (660 BCE) and the earliest emperors of Japan are mythical. This does not necessarily imply that the persons referred to did not exist, merely that there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. Dates in the before the late 7th century were likely recorded using the Genka calendar system.

For those monarchs, and also for the Emperors Ōjin and Nintoku, the lengths of reign are likely to have been exaggerated in order to make the origins of the imperial family sufficiently ancient to satisfy numerological expectations. It is widely believed that the epoch of 660 BCE was chosen because it is a &quot;xīn-yǒu&quot; year in the sexagenary cycle, which according to Taoist beliefs was an appropriate year for a revolution to take place. As Taoist theory also groups together 21 sexagenary cycles into one unit of time, it is assumed that the compilers of assigned the year 601 (a &quot;xīn-yǒu&quot; year in which Prince Shotoku&#x27;s reformation took place) as a &quot;modern revolution&quot; year, and consequently recorded 660 BCE, 1260 years prior to that year, as the founding epoch.

===&quot;Kesshi Hachidai&quot;===
For the eight emperors of Chapter 4, only the years of birth and reign, year of naming as Crown Prince, names of consorts, and locations of tomb are recorded. They are called the &quot;Kesshi Hachidai&quot; (&quot;, &quot;eight generations lacking history&quot;) because no legends (or a few, as quoted in &quot;Nihon Ōdai Ichiran&quot;) are associated with them. Some studies support the view that these emperors were invented to push Jimmu&#x27;s reign further back to the year 660 BCE. itself somewhat elevates the &quot;tenth&quot; emperor Sujin, recording that he was called the &quot;Hatsu-Kuni-Shirasu&quot; (&quot;: first nation-ruling) emperor.

== Influences ==
The tale of Urashima Tarō is developed from the brief mention in (Emperor Yūryaku Year 22) that a certain child of Urashima visited Horaisan and saw wonders. The later tale has plainly incorporated elements from the famous anecdote of &quot;Luck of the Sea and Luck of the Mountains&quot; (Hoderi and Hoori) found in . The later developed Urashima tale contains the Rip Van Winkle motif, so some may consider it an early example of fictional time travel.

<text>The United States Senate&#x27;s Special Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws, 1951–77, known more commonly as the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS) and sometimes the McCarran Committee, was authorized by S. 366, approved December 21, 1950, to study and investigate (1) the administration, operation, and enforcement of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (, also known as the McCarran Act) and other laws relating to espionage, sabotage, and the protection of the internal security of the United States and (2) the extent, nature, and effects of subversive activities in the United States &quot;including, but not limited to, espionage, sabotage, and infiltration of persons who are or may be under the domination of the foreign government or organization controlling the world Communist movement or any movement seeking to overthrow the Government of the United States by force and violence&quot;. The resolution also authorized the subcommittee to subpoena witnesses and require the production of documents. Because of the nature of its investigations, the subcommittee is considered by some to be the Senate equivalent to the older House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).

The chairman of the subcommittee for the 82nd United States Congress was Patrick McCarran of Nevada. William Jenner of Indiana took over during the 83rd United States Congress after the Republicans gained control of the Senate in the 1952 election. When the Democrats regained control in the 84th Congress (1955–1957), James O. Eastland of Mississippi became chairman, a position he had until the subcommittee was abolished during 1977.

The subjects of its investigations during the 1950s include the formulation of U.S. foreign policy in Asia; the scope of Soviet activity in the United States; subversion in the Federal Government, particularly in the Department of State and Department of Defense; immigration; the United Nations; youth organizations; the television, radio, and entertainment industry; the telegraph industry; the defense industry; labor unions; and educational organizations. In the 1960s, the investigations were expanded to include civil rights and racial issues, campus disorders, and drug trafficking. The subcommittee published over 400 volumes of hearings and numerous reports, documents, and committee prints.

During March 1951, FBI officials began a formal liaison program with the SISS in contract to the informal HUAC-FBI relationship, whereby SISS agreed to focus its hearings on &quot;matters of current internal security significance...[and also] to help the Bureau in every possible manner&quot;. Under this program, the SISS forwarded to the FBI any confidential information they uncovered and the FBI conducted name checks on prospective SISS witnesses, submitted reports on targeted organizations, and provided memoranda &quot;with appropriate leads and suggested clues&quot;. This was all intended to avert the perception that HUAC&#x27;s purpose was to discredit the loyalty of officials of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. This program reflected the FBI director&#x27;s unqualified confidence in McCarran&#x27;s ability to serve the cause of anticommunism and to protect the confidentiality of FBI sources.

The investigation of the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) was the first major investigation initiated by the subcommittee. Some people accused the IPR leadership of spying for the USSR. Owen Lattimore, editor of the IPR journal &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot;, was especially singled out for criticism. It is also believed that the pressure of the investigation triggered the suicide of the UN Assistant Secretary General Abraham Feller on November 13, 1952.

To investigate these charges, the SISS took possession of the older files of the IPR, which had been stored at the Lee, Massachusetts farm of Edward C. Carter, an IPR trustee. The subcommittee&#x27;s investigators studied these records for 5 months, then held hearings for nearly 1 year (July 25, 1951 – June 20, 1952). The final report of the subcommittee was issued in July 1952 (S. Rpt. 2050, 82d Cong., 2d sess., Serial 11574).

<text>The Kettle Valley Railway was a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) that operated across southern British Columbia, west of Midway running to Rock Creek, then north to Myra Canyon, down to Penticton over to Princeton, Coalmont, Brookmere, Coquihalla and finally Hope where it connected to the main CPR line.

It opened in 1915 and was abandoned in portions beginning in 1961, with the surviving portion west of Penticton seeing their last trains in 1989.

Much of the railway&#x27;s original route has been converted to a multi-use recreational trail, known as the Kettle Valley Rail Trail, which carries the Trans-Canada Trail through this part of British Columbia.

==History==

The Kettle Valley Railway was built out of necessity to service the growing mining demands in the Southern Interior region of British Columbia. When the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) completed the transcontinental railway in 1885, the route cut through the Rocky Mountains at Kicking Horse and Rogers Passes, then followed the Fraser River for the remainder of the distance to Vancouver. This selected routing was significantly to the north of the mining towns within the Southern Interior. Those critical of the CPR believed that the railway should have been routed along the Dewdney Trail, through the southern portions of British Columbia in order to fulfill politician pledges to keep Americans out of British Columbia should they ever attempt to dominate mining operations in British Columbia&#x27;s South. However, geography was the main reason the CPR followed the transcontinental railway route that it had selected. Too many mountain ranges stood between Alberta and Vancouver in the southern portions of British Columbia, and CPR had selected what they felt was the path of least resistance.

Once silver was discovered within the region in the spring of 1887, thousands of Americans flooded into the BC&#x27;s Southern Interior, and essentially took control of the region. These miners quickly found that it was much quicker and cheaper to get their supplies from the recently completed Northern Pacific Railroad that transited through Spokane. Once word caught on, British Columbia&#x27;s Southern Interior essentially became a commercial annex of the United States. Provincial and Federal officials quickly agreed that a second railway dubbed the &quot;Coast-to-Kootenay&quot; railway within British Columbia was required in order to help preserve Canadian sovereignty of British Columbia, and to also retain the valuable mining revenues within Canada.

The route selected involved connecting the railroad with Vancouver. However, this was not an easy task, as two mountain ranges stood in the way. Construction was some of the costliest per track mile when compared against most other North American railway projects, costing almost $20 million, and it took nearly 20 years to complete. Construction of the railway was not undertaken all at once, or even by one single company. In the process of realizing a completed &quot;Coast-to-Kootenay&quot; railway, a number of &quot;paper railways&quot; emerged. These were railways that never progressed beyond the proposed stage. However some railroads did progress past the proposal stage. The CPR initiated the Nicola Valley Railroad in the early 1890s. This railway connected the town of Merritt with the CPR mainline at Spences Bridge. The Midway &amp; Vernon Railroad was a paper railway that actually started construction. It was hoped that the Midway &amp; Vernon railway would connect Midway (the westernmost station of the CPR-owned Columbia and Western Railway) with Vernon. However, due to funding issues, construction on this railway was stopped. However portions of the completed railway grade were included in the Kettle Valley Railway when the section between Penticton and Midway was completed.

The core portion of the Kettle Valley Railway started in Hope up the steep Coquihalla Valley through the narrow rocky canyon to Coquihalla Pass, transited through GN track via Brookmere, Tulameen, to Princeton; again back on CP track up the grasslands at Jura, through the light forest to Osprey Lake, and down to Summerland, Penticton, Beaverdell and terminated in Midway. An additional, earlier-constructed CPR branch line connected to Spences Bridge, and Merritt. The KVR took over administration and operation of the CPR Spences Bridge-Nicola line in early 1916. The KVR connected this line up the Coldwater River valley to connect with the KVR mainline at Brodie, BC, just west of Brookmere, BC. (After the closure of the Coquihalla Subdivision in late 1959, the Brookmere-Merritt-Spences Bridge line became the connection to the CPR main line.)

After the end of the First World War, additional spur lines connected Copper Mountain with Princeton, Oliver with Penticton. (In 1944, the Osoyoos Subdivision was extended another 10 miles to connect Oliver with Osoyoos.) In the late 1930s until into the 1960s, the portion of the former Columbia &amp; Western Railway from Midway, through Grand Forks continuing through to Castlegar was also periodically referred to as being part of the KVR as well. However, with the exception of some isolated track at Grand Forks, BC, no part of the Boundary Subdivision (Nelson-Midway) was ever part of official KV territory. Former Columbia &amp; Western territory was always administered by the Kootenay Division. In later years of operations after 1962, the Kootenay Division administered the Carmi Subdivision all the way west to the east end of the yard at Penticton, BC.

Much of the KVR was built in response to the construction of the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway (VV&amp;E). The VV&amp;E was owned by Great Northern Railway. Although the CPR and the GNR had indulged in fierce competition in Boundary, West and East Kootenay Districts, that competition was cooling considerably by the time the construction of the KVR began in 1910. By 1913, prodded by the provincial government, the GNR had reached formal construction and then as regular operations loomed, joint track operations agreements with the KVR.

The Kettle Valley Railway between Merritt and Midway was opened for service on May 31, 1915. On that date, the first two passenger trains commenced service. The Kettle Valley Railway was its own entity, but in practical reality, under the thumb of senior CPR management after about 1912. The Canadian Pacific Railway eventually took over operations of the KVR at the beginning of 1931. The former KVR territory was folded into the CPR&#x27;s BC District at that time as the Kettle Valley Division.

Rail service on the KVR consisted of both passenger and freight trains. Passenger service over the line consisted for many years of the &quot;Kettle Valley Express&quot; and the &quot;Kootenay Express&quot;, which carried passengers between Vancouver, BC and Medicine Hat, Alberta. Freight carried on the KVR consisted primarily of ore from the Kootenay region of British Columbia, as well as forestry products and fruit from the Okanagan. Finished goods were primarily brought into the Southern Interior on trains heading Eastbound. During the Kettle Valley Railway&#x27;s lifespan, on numerous occasions it was called upon to act as &quot;The Second Mainline&quot; when washouts, avalanches and rock slides closed off the main CPR line through the Fraser Canyon. CPR recognized the benefit of having a second railway transiting through British Columbia, so beginning in the late 1930s and up until 1959, they set off on an upgrade program that saw the weight-bearing strength of the rails increased, as well as bridge and trestle improvements which brought the railway closer to mainline standards.

The first portion to be abandoned was the Copper Mountain Branch in 1957. The loss of traffic due to the Copper Mountain Mine closure spelled the end for this line. The second part of the KVR to be abandoned was the Coquihalla subdivision. In 1959 there was a large washout and the line was closed for some time. The CPR officials in Montreal decided to close the line permanently. Many say that their decision was short sighted. In the late 1940s/early 1950s the CPR invested quite a lot of money in upgrading the line. including many new bridges. (Others, better-informed, knew that the 1950s upgrades were part of a larger corporate strategy: it aimed at getting rid of unprofitable lines such as the Coquihalla Subdivision.)

Through freight was discontinued throughout the line in 1961, and the last passenger train operated in January 1964. With the end of scheduled through-freight service in September 1961, the former KVR line essentially became a wandering, low-trafficked branch line. All rail service stopped from Midway to Penticton (including the famed Myra Canyon section) in May 1973, with the trackage being labelled as abandoned in 1978. Rails along this section were removed in 1979-1980 as the result of a grant of abandonment from the Canadian Transport Commission.

In 1977 the CP abandoned part of the Osoyoos Subdivision from Okanagan Falls to Osoyoos. This was due to the loss of fruit traffic to trucks. The remainder of the former KVR was doing quite well. In the early 1970s, at various times when forest products were shipping at peak rates, trains were operated between Penticton and Spences Bridge daily. This traffic gradually diminished as the 1970s progressed. Train service declined correspondingly. In early 1983, wood chip service was moved to trucking and from that point onwards, rail traffic quickly diminished to a couple of trains per week. Penticton station building and mechanical servicing facilities were closed at Penticton in the spring of 1985. From that time until the end of train service in March 1989, train crews working the Princeton Subdivision west of Penticton, were headquartered at Merritt.

About 2 miles of former KVR track also survived westward from Midway to a sawmill at West Midway. After 1976, Kootenay Division crews handled whatever work was required west of Midway. In fact, even though the Carmi Subdivision had closed to through service between Penticton and Carmi, BC, train service was maintained as far west as Beaverdell until late 1976. After 1977, no trains went past West Midway.
One of the major landmarks on the former line are the Othello-Quintette Tunnels, which are lined up in a straight line, cutting through the Coquihalla River&#x27;s gorge near Hope. They are open in summer for sightseeing. Andrew McCulloch, who oversaw the engineering projects which resulted in the complex series of bridges and tunnels through Coquihalla Canyon, was an avid reader of William Shakespeare. As a result of an anniversary of the Bard&#x27;s death in 1916, McCulloch had a role in naming Coquihalla Subdivision stations after characters in Shakespearean literature, such as Iago, Romeo, Juliet, Lear, Jessica, and Portia. Shylock was never an official KVR station name. A spur just below Portia was unofficially known as &#x27;Shylock Spur.&#x27;

On the Smithsonian Folkways FW03569 1961 recording, &quot;Bunkhouse and Forecastle Songs of the Northwest,&quot; Stanley G. Triggs sings a song called &quot;The Kettle Valley Line&quot; while accompanying himself on the mandolin.

==Myra Canyon Trestles==

One of the most popular sections of the hiking trail along the former Kettle Valley Railway line is the section through Myra Canyon. Myra Canyon is located south of Kelowna on Okanagan Mountain. The section of line originally transited between Midway and Penticton. When the railway was built, the section of railway between Myra station and June Springs station required 18 wooden trestles and two tunnels in order to traverse the deep canyon.

For years after the abandonment of this section of rail line, the area was a noted attraction, with its relatively gentle grade, it became a hiker and cyclist haven. Years of disrepair on the trestles began to take its toll on the line. In some cases vandals had removed railway ties on the larger steel bridges, thus creating large gaps. Hikers and cyclists wanting to cross the trestles would be required to walk on sections of steel no wider than a foot across where the ties were removed. This would not normally be an issue, but many of these trestles and bridges were hundreds of feet in height. After a fatal accident involving a cyclist on one of the trestles, many people petitioned to have the bridges and trestles made safer. These upgrades included repairs, the installation of handrails and planks so that people did not have to jump between each railway tie.

This section of the railway was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2002.

From August to September 2003, lightning sparked the 2003 Okanagan Mountain Park Fire in Okanagan Mountain Provincial Park. This fire rapidly grew in strength and size and made its way southeast across Okanagan Mountain. This fire engulfed many portions of the KVR between Penticton and McCulloch Lake. Despite concerted efforts by the firefighters, the fire claimed 14 of the 18 trestles within Myra Canyon. In addition, the bridge decks of two of the metal bridges were also destroyed in the fire.

Soon after the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire in 2003, the BC provincial government announced that it would rebuild the damaged and destroyed trestles and bridges. In addition, safety improvements including stabilizing rock faces along the line and clearing rock also has taken place. The trestles have since been rebuilt and the trail is fully open to the public. There are indications that plans for further improvement are in place, such as a restroom located at approximately the middle of the trail.

==Quintette Tunnels==

When constructing the railway through the roughest portion of the Coquihalla Canyon, chief engineer Andrew McCulloch determined that a routing proposed by his subordinates through this section was unnecessarily long or complex. McCulloch recalculated the requirements and decided that a straight section of track through this area was required; in order to achieve this, five closely aligned tunnels would be required. He also determined that two bridges would need to be built between three of the tunnels. These tunnels were eventually known as the Quintette tunnels. These tunnels are a popular tourist attraction, and are located along the existing Coquihalla Highway (however they are not visible from the highway). These tunnels are also known as the Othello Tunnels because they are near the Othello Railway station, named for the Shakespeare character, as is the case with other stations on this stretch of the railway named by McCullough.

==Kettle Valley Steam Railway==

The Kettle Valley Steam Railway has been operating a heritage railway along a preserved 10-kilometre section from Prairie Valley Station to Canyon View Siding, near Summerland, British Columbia. This is the only active remaining section of the Kettle Valley Railway. The last freight haul on the KVR was in 1989, after which CP Rail obtained permission to abandon and remove the final section of rails. A heritage society sprang up in a bid to save a portion of the rail line. Their efforts were successful in preserving the section, and they proceeded to prepare rail operations. In the original position of the Summerland station, a maintenance building was erected. Sidings were placed at Prairie Valley, and at Canyon View (North side of the Trout Creek Bridge). Temporary stations were built at Prairie Valley, Canyon View and at the original Summerland Station. Eventually a permanent station was built at the Prairie Valley station providing a great access point for the railway.

The railway initially operated with one 1924 Shay locomotive loaned from the BC Forest Discovery Centre in Duncan, British Columbia. It was originally operated by the Mayo Lumber Company on Vancouver Island, and was specifically designed to work on rough forestry trackage.

Rolling stock for the railway was donated from BC Rail. These railcars are Canadian Pacific in origin, but were used by BC Rail for service on the Royal Hudson.

The most recent locomotive addition to the Kettle Valley Steam Railway is a Canadian Pacific Montreal Locomotive Works 2-8-0. This locomotive, originally delivered as number 3916, it now is number 3716 and runs on the KVSR. It was built for the CPR, and operated primarily in the Kootenays. It was stored in Port Coquitlam in 1966, and was restored in 1975. It was used as a backup locomotive to the Royal Hudson until it was retired from BC Rail&#x27;s service in April 2001.

The train now travels to the middle of the Trout Creek Bridge. Plans also were to extend the run to Faulder along the final portions of remaining original trackage. The Steam Railway owns track to Faulder. However, tours do not run to that location.

==Television==
Kettle Valley Railway was featured on the historical television series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns, season 2, episode 8.

Because the CP route through the Rockies had been upgraded to modern steel bridges, the CBC miniseries &quot;The National Dream&quot; filmed its opening and a number of scenes where wooden trestles were wanted on the Myra Canyon section of the Kettle Valley Railway. The locomotive used was Canadian Pacific 4-4-0 No. 136, disguised as CPR 148.

<doc id="316364" wikidata="Q968964" url="?curid=316364" title="Ninomiya Sontoku">
<text>, also known as Ninomiya Kinjirō (二宮 金次郎), was a Japanese agriculturalist. He lost his parents when he was a boy, but through hard work and diligence, he rebuilt his fallen family at the age of 20. Later, he rebuilt approximately 600 villages and became a shogunate retainer. His ideas and actions were inherited as the &quot;Hōtokusha&quot; Movement.

==Life==
Ninomiya Sontoku was born to a poor peasant family with a name of Kinjiro in Kayama (), Ashigarakami-gun, Sagami province. His father died when he was 14 and his mother died two years later. He was then placed in his uncle&#x27;s household.

While working on his uncle&#x27;s land, Sontoku studied on his own. He later obtained abandoned land on his own and transformed it into agricultural land, eventually restoring his household on his own at the age of 20. He achieved considerable wealth as a landlord while in his 20s. He was then recruited to run a small feudal district which was facing considerable financial difficulty. He achieved this by reviving the local economy, particularly through agricultural development. The daimyō, hearing of his achievement, eventually recruited Sontoku to run Odawara Domain then Sagami Province.

It is said that during his administration a famine struck Odawara. Sontoku proposed opening up the public granaries to feed the starving populace. He was opposed by his fellow bureaucrats who reminded him that permission had to be granted by the shōgun for commoners to have access to the rice stores. In that case, Sontoku replied, no one, including the bureaucrats, could eat the public rice before getting the shōgun&#x27;s approval. They quickly changed their minds and decided that, since it was an emergency, the people should be fed immediately. He was eventually entrusted with one of the shogunate&#x27;s estates, which was a great honor for someone of his low origin.

His philosophy and methodology became a standard format in feudal land developmental and economic management. The name &quot;Sontoku&quot; was given to him for his accomplishments. After his death, the emperor awarded him with &quot;Juji&#x27;i&quot; (), which was the Lower Fourth Honor under the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; rank system.

==Philosophy==
Though he did not leave written philosophical work, his ideas were later transcribed by his disciples: Tomita Takayoshi, Fukuzumi Masae and Saitō Takayuki. Ninomiya combined three strands of traditional teachings — Buddhism, Shintōism and Confucianism — and transformed them into practical ethical principles that matured out of his experiences. He saw agriculture as the highest form of humanity because it was the cultivation of resources given by the Kami.

==Economics==
Ninomiya Sontoku emphasized the importance of compound interest which was not well understood among samurai and peasants. He calculated the maturity of each interest rate for 100 years to show its significance by using the Japanese abacus (soroban).

He viewed agricultural village life as communal, where surpluses from one year were invested to develop further land or saved for worse years, and shared by members of the community. He was aware that developed land had a lower tax base than established agricultural land, and he was adept at financial management which he applied to his estate. He encouraged migrants from other estates and rewarded them if they successfully established an agricultural household.

He started his own financial institutions called &quot;gojoukou&quot; (), which appear to be forerunners of credit unions. Each member of the village union could borrow interest-free funds for 100 days, while the entire membership shared the cost in case of default. The combination of land development, immigration, and communal finance all managed under the diligent use of abacuses was a success and became the standard methodology of economic development in feudal Japan.

==Popular culture==
It is not uncommon to see statues of Ninomiya in or in front of Japanese schools, especially elementary schools. Typically they show him as a boy reading a book while walking and carrying firewood on his back. These statues depict popular stories that said Ninomiya was reading and studying every moment he could. The oldest remaining statue was installed in 1924 at an elementary school in Maeshiba Village, now a district of Toyohashi, Aichi; many of the bronze statues were removed during World War II and donated for metal, but the Maeshiba statue has remained, as it is concrete. Additional statues have been removed starting in the 1970s, as they were perceived to set a poor example for children walking near motor vehicle traffic while distracted by reading. A bronze Ninomiya statue, sculpted by Junichiro Hannya, was installed in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles in 1983.

There is a reference to him in the novel &quot;Obasan&quot; by Joy Kogawa. The father often tells the story of Ninomiya Sontoku to his children, relating how 
&quot;Up early to the mountains for wood before the rooster calls &#x27;ko-ke-kok-ko!&#x27; He studies and works every day to feed his baby brother and his mother. That is how he becomes the great teacher, Ninomiya Sontaku of Odawara, Japan.&quot;

==War loot==
In October 1994, Rollins College, a small private liberal arts college in Winter Park, Florida, United States made international headlines when the government of Japan, per a request from Okinawa Prefecture, asked for the return of a statue that was taken as war loot. It was taken by Clinton C. Nichols, a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy and Rollins graduate, after the Battle of Okinawa. Nichols presented the statue of Ninomiya Sontoku in 1946 to then Rollins President Hamilton Holt who promised to keep it in the main lobby of the college&#x27;s Warren Administration Building forever.

At first, the college rejected the offer made by Okinawan officials, who suggested that a replica of the statue would be presented to the school if the original was returned. However, after consulting with the U.S. State Department and the college&#x27;s board of trustees, then Rollins President Rita Bornstein accepted the offer. The statue was returned to Okinawa in 1995 in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. In addition to providing the college with a replica of the original statue, the government of Okinawa and Rollins signed an &quot;agreement of cooperation&quot; that pledges to develop cooperative projects between the college and Shogaku Junior and Senior High School — where the original statue has been placed.

<text>Bashan (; ; or &quot;Basanitis&quot;) is the ancient, biblical name used for the northernmost region of Transjordan during the Iron Age. It is situated in modern-day Jordan and Syria. Its western part, nowadays known as the Golan Heights, was taken back by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War.

Bashan has been inhabited since at least the fourth millennium BCE. Its earliest mention is found in a Sumerian text dating back to the third millennium BCE. During the Late Bronze Age, Bashan is recorded in Egyptian sources as being under the control of their empire. Biblical tradition holds that an Amorite kingdom in Bashan was conquered by the Israelites during the reign of King Og. Throughout the monarchic period, Bashan was contested between the kingdoms of Israel and Aram-Damascus. Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria eventually intervened, removing Bashan from Israel&#x27;s control.

Bashan is mentioned 59 times in the Hebrew Bible. It is the location of Ashtaroth Karnaim and Edrei (modern-day Daraa), as well as the city of Golan, which gave its name to the modern Golan Heights. The name Bashan fell out of use in classical antiquity, in which the region was divided into four districts: Batanaea, Gaulanitis, Trachonitis and Auranitis.

== History ==

=== Hebrew Bible ===

The Book of Numbers tells that King Og of Bashan came out against the Israelites led by Moses at the time of their entrance into the Promised Land, but was vanquished in battle (; ). states:Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. And the said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. So the our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
Along with the half of Gilead, it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh (). According to the Book of Joshua, Golan, one of its cities, became a Levitical city and a city of refuge (). Argob, in Bashan, was one of Solomon&#x27;s commissariat districts ().

In the late-9th century BCE, the cities of Bashan were taken by Hazael, monarch of the Syrian kingdom of Aram-Damascus (), but were soon after reconquered by Jehoash () who overcame the Syrians in three battles, according to the prophecy of Elisha ().

From this time, Bashan almost disappears from history, although there are biblical references to the wild cattle of its rich pastures (see , and Amos 4:1), the oaks of its forests (; ; ), the beauty of its extensive plains (also in Amos 4:1), ), and the rugged majesty of its mountains (). Bashan is also mentioned in : &quot;[The Gadites] lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its outlying villages, and on all the pasturelands of Sharon as far as they extended.&quot;

=== Later periods ===
The Bashan was ultimately conquered and pillaged by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which held onto it from 732 to 610 BCE. It later saw security and prosperity under the Achaemenid Empire; its settlements became better developed and culturally Aramaized.

=== Ugarit ===
In some Semitic languages bashan &quot;(bšn)&quot; means serpent. In Ugaritic, masculine and feminine forms are available, &quot;bashanim&quot; and &quot;bashanat&quot; are male and female snakes.

<doc id="316376" wikidata="Q2118973" url="?curid=316376" title="Chedorlaomer">
<text>Chedorlaomer, also spelled Kedorlaomer (; ; &quot;Khodollogomor&quot;), is a king of Elam mentioned in Genesis 14. Genesis portrays him as allied with three other kings, campaigning against five Canaanite city-states in response to an uprising in the days of Abraham.

==Etymology==

The name Chedorlaomer is associated with familiar Elamite components, such as &quot;kudur&quot; &quot;servant&quot;, and Lagamal, an important goddess in the Elamite pantheon. &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; states that, apart from the fact that Chedorlaomer can be identified as a proper Elamite compound, all else is matter of controversy and &quot;the records give only the rather negative result that from Babylonian and Elamite documents nothing definite has been learned of Chedorlaomer&quot;.

==Background==

=== Chedorlaomer&#x27;s reign ===
After twelve years under Elamite rule, in the thirteenth year, the Cities of the Plain (Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Zoara) rebelled against Chedorlaomer. To put down the rebellion, he called upon three other allies from Shinar, Ellasar, and Tidal &quot;nations&quot; regions. (Genesis 14:9)

=== Chedorlaomer&#x27;s campaigns ===
The following allies fought as allies of Chedorlaomer in the fourteenth year of his rule.
*King Amraphel of Shinar (possibly Sumer)
*King Arioch of Ellasar
*King Tidal of &quot;nations&quot; – possibly the Hittites

Chedorlaomer&#x27;s campaigns aimed to show Elam&#x27;s might to all territories under Elamite authority. His armies and allies plundered tribes and cities for their provisions, who were en route to the revolting cities of the Jordan plain.

According to , these are the cities plundered by Elam:
* The Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim
* The Zuzim in Ham
* The Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim
* The Horites in Mount Seir as far as the Desert of Paran near the wilderness
* The Amalekites in Kadesh at En-mishpat
* The Amorites in Hazezontamar (Ein Gedi)
* The Canaanites of the cities of the Jordan plain

=== Chedorlaomer&#x27;s defeat ===

After warring against the cities of the plain at the Battle of Siddim, Chedorlaomer went to Sodom and Gomorrah to collect bounty. At Sodom, among the spoils of war, he took Lot and his entire household captive. When Lot&#x27;s uncle Abraham received news of what happened, he assembled a battle unit of 318 men who pursued the Elamite forces north of Damascus to Hobah. Abraham and one of his divisions then proceeded to defeat Chedorlaomer. ()

While the King James Version verse 17 translated the Hebrew word in question as as &quot;slaughtered&quot; (), Young&#x27;s Literal Translation uses the term &quot;smiting.&quot; ()

==Historical identification==
Genesis 14:1 lists four names: &quot;It was in the time of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedor-Laomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of the Goiim.&quot;

Following the discovery of documents written in the Elamite language and Babylonian language, it was thought that &quot;Chedorlaomer&quot; is a transliteration of the Elamite name &quot;Kudur-Lagamar&quot;. However, no mention of a king named &quot;Kudur-Lagamar&quot; has yet been found; inscriptions that were thought to contain this name are now known to have different names (the confusion arose due to similar lettering). According to Stephanie Dalley, the lack of extrabiblical attestations of the king&#x27;s name is explained by the fact that there were several concurrent Elamite rulers in the 18th century BC, and that they are commonly referred to by their titles rather than by their names.

One modern interpretation of Genesis 14 is summed up by Michael Astour in &quot;The Anchor Bible Dictionary&quot; (s.v. &quot;Amraphel&quot;, &quot;Arioch&quot; and &quot;Chedorlaomer&quot;), who explains the story as a product of anti-Babylonian propaganda during the 6th century Babylonian captivity of the Jews:
The &quot;Chedorlaomer tablets&quot; are now thought to be from the 7th or 6th century BCE, a millennium after the time of Hammurabi, but at roughly the time when the main elements of Genesis are thought to have been set down. Another prominent scholar considers a relationship between the tablet and Genesis speculative, but identifies Tudhula as a veiled reference to Sennacherib of Assyria, and Chedorlaomer as &quot;a recollection of a 12th century BCE king of Elam who briefly ruled Babylon.&quot;

Some modern scholars suggest that Chedorlomer in the Chedorlaomer tablets might refer to the Elamite usurper Kutir-Naḫḫunte in the 7th century BCE. He assassinated Khallushu, who murdered Shutruk-Naḫḫunte II and in 694 BCE managed to briefly capture Babylon and the Neo-Assyrian governor of Babylonia, Aššur-nādin-šumi, causing the Assyrian conquest of Elam.

<text>&lt;/math&gt;}}

Equivalent Average (EqA) is a baseball metric invented by Clay Davenport and intended to express the production of hitters in a context independent of park and league effects. It represents a hitter&#x27;s productivity using the same scale as batting average. Thus, a hitter with an EqA over .300 is a very good hitter, while a hitter with an EqA of .220 or below is poor. An EqA of .260 is defined as league average.

The date EqA was invented cannot readily be documented, but references to it were being offered on the rec.sport.baseball usenet group as early as January 14, 1996. Baseball Prospectus renamed it True Average (TAv) in 2010, in an attempt to make it more accessible.

==Definition and rationale==

In the formula given in the box above, the abbreviations are H=Hit, TB=Total bases, BB=Bases on balls (walks), HBP=Hit by pitch, SB=Stolen base, SH=Sacrifice hit (typically, sacrifice bunt), SF=Sacrifice fly, AB=At bat, CS=Caught stealing.

EqA is one of several sabermetric approaches which validated the notion that minor league hitting statistics can be useful measurements of Major League ability. It does this by adjusting a player&#x27;s raw statistics for park and league effects.

For instance, the Pacific Coast League is a minor league known to be a very friendly venue for hitters. Therefore, a hitter in the PCL may have notably depressed raw statistics (a lower batting average, fewer home runs, etc.) if he were hitting in another league at the same level. Additionally, in general the level of competition at the PCL is lower than that in the Majors, so a hitter in the PCL would likely have lesser raw statistics in the Majors. EqA is thus useful to strip certain illusions from the surface of players&#x27; raw statistics.

EqA is a derivative of Raw EqA, or REqA. REqA is (H + TB + 1.5*(BB + HBP + SB) + SH + SF) divided by (AB + BB + HBP + SH + SF + CS + SB). REqA in turn is adjusted to account for league difficulty and scale to create EqA.

EqA has been used for several years by the authors of the &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot;. It is also one of the statistics predicted for each hitter in Baseball Prospectus&#x27;s annual PECOTA forecasts.

EqA is scaled like a batting average, which is the number of safe hits divided by the number of official at bats. However, Davenport EqA aims to capture not so many hits per at bat but instead &quot;runs produced per at bat&quot;. In that sense, EqA is akin to a larger family of run estimators that sabermetricians use.

<doc id="316389" wikidata="Q161985" url="?curid=316389" title="1 Maccabees">
<text>1 Maccabees, also known as the First Book of Maccabees, First Maccabees, and abbreviated as 1 Macc., is a deuterocanonical book which details the history of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire as well as the founding and earliest history of the independent Hasmonean kingdom. It describes the promulgation of decrees forbidding traditional Jewish practices by King Antiochus IV Epiphanes and the formation of a rebellion against him by Mattathias of the Hasmonean family and his five sons. Mattathias&#x27;s son Judas Maccabeus (Judah Maccabee) takes over the revolt and the rebels as a group are called the Maccabees; the book chronicles in detail the successes and setbacks of the rebellion. While Judas is eventually killed in battle, the Maccabees eventually achieve autonomy and then independence for Judea under the leadership of the Hasmonean family. Judas&#x27;s brother Simon Thassi is declared High Priest by will of the Jewish people. The time period described is from around 170 BC to 134 BC.

The author is anonymous, but he probably wrote in the newly independent Hasmonean kingdom after the success of the Maccabean Revolt in the late 2nd century BC. 1 Maccabees was probably written in Hebrew originally. However, this original Hebrew has been lost, and the work only survives in translation in Koine Greek contained in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Jewish scriptures. The Septuagint was preserved by early Christians as the basis for the Christian Old Testament. It became part of the deuterocanon in early Christianity. The book is held as canonical scripture today in the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches (except for the Orthodox Tewahedo). The book is not part of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and is not considered canonical by Protestant denominations nor in any of the major branches of Judaism. Some Protestants include the book as biblical apocrypha, material useful for background and edification but that is not canonical. Rabbinic Judaism generally disapproved of the rule of the Hasmonean dynasty, but the book is openly pro-Hasmonean, one of several factors for a lack of enthusiasm for the book within later Judaism.

1 Maccabees is best known for its account of the recapture of Jerusalem in the year 164 BC and rededication of the Second Temple: the origin behind the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.

==Authorship and date==
The author of 1 Maccabees is anonymous and unknown.  He wrote in the post-independence Hasmonean kingdom, probably during the reign of High Priest John Hyrcanus (reigned ~134–104 BC), with a few scholars suggesting that early in the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (reigned 103–76 BC) is also a possibility.  All agree that the book was written before 63 BC, as the author shows great admiration toward Rome and does not know of the Roman general Pompey conquering Jerusalem and reducing the Hasmonean kingdom to a client state of the Roman Republic in that year. He was likely a court historian or equivalent. The author appears to be very familiar with Judea and its geography, but appears less well-informed about the wider Hellenistic world. The entire work is generally considered to be a unity composed by a single author on both philological and thematic grounds, although there are occasional short passages sometimes contested as potentially being added at a later date.

==Title==

The title &quot;1 Maccabees&quot; is not the original title of the work. Rather, it comes from the Septuagint, which gave it that title to distinguish it from the other books of the Maccabees. In the book itself, &quot;Maccabee&quot; is used solely as a personal title for Judah Maccabee (Latinized as Judas Maccabeus). Judas&#x27;s &quot;Maccabee&quot; title is generally tied to the Aramaic word &quot;maqqaba&quot; (&quot;makebet&quot; in modern Hebrew), &quot;hammer&quot; or &quot;sledgehammer&quot;. It is unknown how he got this epithet; most presume it was in recognition of his prowess in battle. The word &quot;Maccabees&quot; in plural, however, does not appear to have been used until centuries after the Maccabean Revolt. At first, it was used to describe the martyrs described in 2 Maccabees. It later became a title given to the rebels as a whole around the 3rd–5th century AD, hence the Septuagint naming the works as books of the Maccabees. This usage of &quot;Maccabees&quot; as a group-term may have originated in Greek, as no usage of it in Hebrew to refer to the rebels survives from any era earlier than the 19th century.

Eusebius, in his book &quot;Church History&quot;, quotes Origen of Alexandria who says the title of the work was , an enigmatic Greek transliteration from a putative Hebrew original title. It is thought that the most likely parts are the Aramaic &quot;səpar&quot; (&quot;book&quot;), bêt (&quot;house&quot; or &quot;dynasty&quot;), and &#x27;ēl (&quot;God&quot;). Various reconstructions have been proposed for the overall phrase:

*&quot;Book of the Prince of the House of Israel&quot;, from the Hebrew , , or &quot;Book of the Prince of the House of God&quot; , .
*&quot;Book of the House of the Princes of God&quot;,
*&quot;The Book of the Dynasty of God&#x27;s Resisters&quot; (in the sense of &quot;those who resist on God&#x27;s behalf&quot;), perhaps from , (&quot;Book of the House who strive for God&quot;).
* &quot;The Book of the House of the Hasmoneans&quot; (or simply &quot;The Book of the Hasmoneans&quot;)
==Language and style==
The book was probably originally written in Hebrew. Both Origen and Jerome claim to have seen a Hebrew text of 1 Maccabees. The surviving Greek script has Hebraisms and Hebrew idioms. It also seems to have been written in Judea where knowledge of Hebrew was more widespread. If it really was originally written in Greek, then the author was intentionally imitating Hebrew style in Greek. The book is not written in colloquial &quot;common&quot; Koine Greek of the 2nd century BC, but rather a more archaic style of Greek consciously imitative of the style of older scriptures. It frequently imitates biblical phraseology and directly cites biblical precedents. The English equivalent would be writing new books in the style of the King James Version of the Bible. It also uses anachronistic terms at times to make explicit parallels between the exploits of the Hasmoneans and earlier Jewish heroes; for example, it refers to the coastal region of Palestine as the land of the Philistines, although the Philistines were no longer a relevant cultural grouping in the era.

The book is generally classed as a historical book of the Bible. While the main focus is a recounting of history, some consider the book to have merit as literary art as well. The narrative is primarily prose text, but is interrupted by seven poetic sections, which imitate classical Hebrew poetry. These include four laments and three hymns of praise. Various historical documents are included as well, notably of negotiations and letters with the Roman Republic and Hellenistic Sparta.

==Contents==
===Structure===
The vast majority of scholars and bible translations divide the book into four or five sections by the leader of the rebellion:
#Chapters 1–2: Introduction
#3:1 to 9:22: The leadership of Judas Maccabeus
#9:23 to 12:53: The leadership of Jonathan Apphus
#Chapters 13–16: The leadership of Simon Thassi

===Synopsis===

The setting of the book is about a century and a half after the conquest of Judea by the Greeks under Alexander the Great, after Alexander&#x27;s empire had been divided so that Judea had become part of the Greek Seleucid Empire. It tells how the Greek ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes attempted to suppress the practice of basic Jewish law, resulting in the Maccabean Revolt. The book covers the whole of the revolt, from 175 to 134 BC, highlighting how the salvation of the Jewish people in this crisis came through Mattathias&#x27; family, particularly his sons, Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan Apphus, and Simon Thassi, and Simon&#x27;s son, John Hyrcanus. The doctrine expressed in the book reflects traditional Jewish teaching, without later doctrines found, for example, in 2 Maccabees. The First Book of Maccabees also gives a list of Jewish colonies scattered elsewhere through the Mediterranean at the time.

In the first chapter, Alexander the Great conquers the territory of Judea, and is later succeeded by the Seleucid Antiochus IV Epiphanes. After successfully invading the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, Antiochus IV captures Jerusalem and removes the sacred objects from the Temple in Jerusalem, slaughtering many Jews. He then imposes a tax and establishes a fortress in Jerusalem.

Antiochus then tries to suppress public observance of Jewish laws, in an attempt to secure control over the Jews. In 168 BC, he desecrates the Temple by setting up an &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; (establishing rites of pagan observance in the Temple, or sacrificing an unclean animal on the altar in the Holy of Holies). Antiochus forbids both circumcision and possession of Jewish scriptures on pain of death. He forbids observance of the sabbath and the offering of sacrifices at the Temple. He also requires Jewish leaders to sacrifice to idols. While enforcement may be targeting only Jewish leaders, ordinary Jews were also killed as a warning to others.

Hellenization included the construction of gymnasia in Jerusalem. Among other effects, this discouraged the Jewish rite of circumcision even further, which had already been officially forbidden; a man&#x27;s state could not be concealed in the gymnasium, where men trained and socialized in the nude. However, 1 Maccabees also insists that there were many Jews who sought out or welcomed the introduction of Greek culture. According to the text, some Jewish men even engaged in foreskin restoration in order to pass as fully Greek.

The narrative reports that news of the desolation reaches Mattathias and his five sons, a priestly family who live in Modein. Mattathias calls upon people loyal to the traditions of Israel to oppose the invaders and the Jewish Hellenizers, and his sons begin a military campaign against them. There is one complete loss of a thousand Jews (men, women, and children) to Antiochus when the Jewish defenders refuse to fight on the Sabbath. The other Jews then reason that, when attacked, they must fight even on the holy day. In 165 BC the Temple is freed and reconsecrated, so that ritual sacrifices may begin again. The festival of Hanukkah is instituted by Judas Maccabeus and his brothers to celebrate this event (1 Maccabees 4:59).

More wars involving Judas and his brothers Simon and Jonathan are reported in chapters 5, 6 and 7. Chapter 6 reports the last days of Antiochus Epiphanes and the accession of his young son Antiochus V Eupator to the throne.

In chapter 8, Judas seeks an alliance with the Roman Republic, aiming to remove the Greeks. Verses 23–32 record an agreement between Rome and the nation of the Jews, whereby each party would act as a willing ally of the other and refuse to supply their enemies in time of war, specific warning being given to Demetrius I Soter that this pact would be activated against him if requested by the Jews. Jewish historian Uriel Rappaport asserts that &quot;the majority of scholars today accept the authenticity of this document&quot;.

After the death of Judas and a period of lawlessness, he is succeeded by his brother Jonathan Apphus, whose battles with the Greek general Bacchides are recounted in chapter 9. Jonathan becomes high priest (1 Maccabees 10:20). Demetrius&#x27; death is reported in 1 Maccabees 10:50, and Ptolemy VI Philometor and Alexander Balas, claimant to the Seleucid throne, enter into an agreement under which Alexander marries Cleopatra Thea, Ptolemy&#x27;s daughter (1 Maccabees 10:58). The relationship between Jonathan and Demetrius&#x27; son and successor, Demetrius II Nicator, is covered in chapter 11: Jonathan provides military support to Demetrius at the latter&#x27;s request (verse 44), and a successful engagement against a popular revolt at Antioch enables the Jews to &quot;gain glory in the sight of the king&quot; (verse 51). Maccabees does not mention the involvement of the mercenaries who are mentioned in other accounts, whereas other accounts do not mention the Jewish involvement. Ultimately the relationship between Jonathan and Demetrius breaks down: Maccabees&#x27; opinion is that Demetrius &quot;broke his word about all that he had promised; he became estranged from Jonathan and did not repay the favors that Jonathan had done him, but treated him very harshly&quot;.

Proposed alliances with Rome and with Areus of Sparta are covered in 1 Maccabees 12:1–23. Jonathan&#x27;s capture in 143 BC, having been double-crossed by Diodotus Tryphon, is recorded in 1 Maccabees 12:48. Simon follows Jonathan as the next Jewish leader &quot;in place of Judas and your brother Jonathan&quot;, taking on civil, military and liturgical roles: &quot;great high priest, governor, and leader of the Jews&quot;. Simon fortifies Jerusalem (1 Maccabees 13:10) and secures the reoccupation of Joppa (1 Maccabees 13:11), leading the people in peace and prosperity until he is murdered by agents of Ptolemy, son of Abubus, who had been named governor of the region by the Macedonian Greeks. The period of peace and prosperity is celebrated in a biblical-style poetic passage, the &quot;Eulogy of Simon&quot;, which Rappaport considers to be &quot;one of the most important poetic passages in 1 Maccabees&quot;.

Simon is succeeded by his son, John, referred to by Josephus as John Hyrcanus.

==As dynastic history==
The author propagates &quot;Hasmonean propaganda&quot; in the sense of upholding the righteousness of the Hasmoneans and their just claim to rule the Hasmonean kingdom. The Hasmoneans were not an obvious choice to be rulers; they did not descend from the priestly line of Zadok that had taken the office of High Priest for generations at the point of the Maccabean Revolt. The author seeks to promote the view that the Hasmoneans were indeed God&#x27;s new chosen and would-be rulers in line with heroes of the Hebrew Bible. Various passages call back to Biblical passages such as Joshua&#x27;s conquests or the battle of David and Goliath and equate the Hasmoneans&#x27; deeds with the earlier stories. Antipathy toward the Seleucid-friendly Hellenizing Jews is unsurprising, as they were enemies in war, but 1 Maccabees extends criticism to internal Jewish opponents of the Hasmoneans as well. In 1 Maccabees, those dissatisfied with the Hasmoneans &quot;hated their nation&quot; as a whole; the Hasmoneans were equated with Judea itself. Jews who complain about Judas&#x27;s activities &quot;bring to the king an accusation against the people&quot;. The book dismisses a defeat suffered by other commanders named Joseph and Azariah as because &quot;they did not listen to Judas and his brothers. But they did not belong to the family of those men through whom deliverance was given to Israel.&quot; All of this makes clear that God has specifically chosen a new dynasty to rule Judea, the Hasmoneans.

While the book holds all the Hasmoneans in high regard, it praises Simon Thassi in particular, the person who would pass the High Priesthood to his sons and establish the dynasty. In Chapter 2, there is a line from a dying Mattathias who tells his sons to always listen to Simon and that &quot;he shall be your father&quot;, seemingly praising him even over Judas. Chapter 14 also features a long panegyric praising Simon as a worthy leader.

==Theology==
The school of philosophy seen in 1 Maccabees is often thought to be a predecessor to the philosophy of the Sadducees in later eras. Notably, the author makes no reference to the idea of a bodily resurrection, which the Sadducees opposed. That said, our knowledge of the Sadducees is scant, so it is difficult to know for sure. The book also comes across as dismissive of martyrdom and passive approaches to resistance, seeing such gestures as futile and pointless. Some scholars go even farther than dismissive; Jonathan Goldstein writes that the author has &quot;considerable contempt for martyrs&quot;. For the author, bold military action while living is the proper response to oppression.

The author sees the revolt as divinely ordained, but downplays direct divine intervention such as miracles. Rather, the author interprets events as God using the military genius of Judas Maccabeus and his brothers as the instrument to achieve the liberation of Judea. One of the most notable and unusual aspects of the book of 1 Maccabees by absence is the lack of any direct mention of God. Rather, the book refers to &quot;heaven&quot; (&quot;ouranós&quot;) instead, such as Judas saying in a speech that &quot;It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from Heaven.&quot; Even if &quot;heaven&quot; is merely shorthand for &quot;God in heaven&quot;, 1 Maccabees is remarkably secular in its depiction of the conflict. No angels or miracles come to save the Jews; rather, it is the divinely-approved firm leadership of the Hasmoneans that leads to victory.

The book 2 Maccabees, preserved right next to 1 Maccabees in the Septuagint, provides a striking contrast in theology, and the works are often compared. 2 Maccabees interprets the misfortunes of the Jews as God&#x27;s punishment for their own sins; the author of 1 Maccabees depicts the problems as due to the external evil of Antiochus IV and his generals, not as a cleansing ordeal that was in some sense divine will.

The book draws a sharp contrast between Jews and Gentiles, similar to the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The persecution of Antiochus IV presumably radicalized the Jews. That said, the author is still proud of forging alliances with others, citing negotiations with the Roman Republic and Sparta. Uriel Rappaport calls it emblematic of Hasmonean politics in general: that the Hasmonean state was an explicitly Jewish one that sought to separate itself from polytheism, yet was pragmatic and sought allies where they could be found.

==Reliability as history==
1 Maccabees is the most extensive source of information on events in Judea from 175 to 135 BC. It has traditionally been considered highly trustworthy, although it is to some extent the &quot;official&quot; version of history according to the Hasmoneans and from the Maccabean point of view. Bezalel Bar-Kochva praises it as among the better military historiography of the period. He argues that the author was likely an eyewitness to at least some of the battles described given his great accuracy and plausibility in describing terrain and troop movements, and was able to obtain firsthand accounts from others in interviews. He also cites the fact that it makes various &quot;admissions against interest&quot; such as openly describing rebel military defeats, unlike 2 Maccabees which obscures or omits such matters.

Jonathan A. Goldstein argues that the book was imitative of older scriptures not merely in linguistic style, but also in content; that is, the author adjusted or invented events to make them fit Biblical parallels better.

== Canonicity ==
Pope Damasus I&#x27;s Council of Rome in 382, if the Gelasian Decree is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical with the list given at Trent including the two books of Maccabees. Origen of Alexandria (253), Augustine of Hippo (), Pope Innocent I (405), Synod of Hippo (393), the Council of Carthage (397), the Council of Carthage (419), the Apostolic Canons, the Council of Florence (1442) and the Council of Trent (1546) listed the first two books of Maccabees as canonical.

During the Protestant Reformation, the book (along with other books in the Catholic deuterocanon) was classed as biblical apocrypha in Protestantism, material useful for background but not canonical. The 1643 Westminster Confession says that the books &quot;are of no authority in the Church of God, not to be any otherwise approved&quot;, for example.

The book was never included in the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh and is not canonical in Judaism. Later Jewish leaders thought poorly of the rule of the Hasmonean dynasty for several reasons, and a document so openly celebratory of them was problematic. Even in stories set during the Maccabean period, references to Judas by name were explicitly removed to avoid hero-worship of the Hasmonean line.

==Influence==

The Jewish historian Josephus of the 1st century AD almost certainly read 1 Maccabees in Greek. He extensively uses the first thirteen chapters of it in Books 12 and 13 of his work &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot;, paraphrasing it directly in parts, although supplementing it with other Greek histories such as Nicolaus of Damascus. He may also have consulted it for Book 1 of &quot;The Jewish War&quot;. It is not known whether Josephus&#x27;s copy of 1 Maccabees was missing the final three chapters, or he simply found a better source for that era of history.

1 Maccabees is only very rarely quoted or referenced by the Church Fathers in the era of early Christianity. When Christians of the Roman Empire discussed the Maccabees, it was usually in reference to the &quot;Maccabean martyrs&quot; described in 2 Maccabees 6 and 2 Maccabees 7, as they were seen as models and precursors to Christian martyrs. As 1 Maccabees has very little to say about the martyrs, it correspondingly was not cited or read.

During the Crusades, Pope Urban II and other church leaders used 1 Maccabees to justify the concept of holy war against the Muslim kingdoms controlling the holy city of Jerusalem. Admired crusaders such as Baldwin I and Godfrey of Bouillon were explicitly compared to Judas Maccabeus, and material from 1 Maccabees was quoted in regards to their deeds. 1 Maccabees was also cited during the 11th–12th century Investiture Controversy concerning whether monarchs had the authority to appoint bishops, or only the Pope. 1 Maccabees includes passages describing the appointment of Jonathan and Simon by Seleucid authorities, so it was generally cited by the side of those who favored royal appointment of bishops.

==Liturgical usage==
The Roman Catholic Lectionary makes use of texts from 1 Maccabees 1 to 6, along with texts from 2 Maccabees 6 and 7, in the weekday readings for the 33rd week in Ordinary Time, in year 1 of the two-year cycle of readings, always in November, and as one of the options available for readings for the dedication of an altar and as one of the suggested readings at a Mass celebrated to honour persecuted Christians.

1 Maccabees is part of the intertestamental Apocrypha section of the Bible used in the Lutheran Churches and the Anglican Communion. Scripture readings from the Apocrypha are included in the lectionaries of the Lutheran Churches. With regard to Anglicanism, in the Church of England&#x27;s lectionary of 1922 in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, 1st Maccabees is appointed annually to be read in late summer/early autumn.

The texts regarding the martyrdoms under Antiochus IV in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees are read by Anabaptist Christians, who faced persecution in their history.

==Manuscripts and publication history==
As noted above, if ancient manuscripts of the hypothesized original Hebrew version existed, they have been lost. The Greek text is extant in two of the three oldest codices of the Greek Septuagint: the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Alexandrinus. It is not in the Codex Vaticanus. Pre-modern translations of the work were made in Latin, Syriac, and Armenian. The Latin translation is sometimes useful to identify certain changes made by Lucian of Antioch to the Greek text.

With the advent of the printing press that obviated the need for scribes to manually and repeatedly copy such works, 1 Maccabees became more widely available. It was included in standard printed Christian Bibles in the deuterocanon section. A Greek version of the text was printed for the first time in 1514–1517 in the Complutensian Polyglot Bible. published a critical edition of the Greek text in 1936, an eclectic compilation of the various surviving manuscripts and the best construction of the original text.

More recent English language versions of the Bible which contain 1 Maccabees include the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV), Good News Translation (GNT), New American Bible, Revised Edition (NABRE), and the Knox Bible.

<text>2 Maccabees, also known as the Second Book of Maccabees, Second Maccabees, and abbreviated as 2 Macc., is a deuterocanonical book which recounts the persecution of Jews under King Antiochus IV Epiphanes and the Maccabean Revolt against him. It concludes with the defeat of the Seleucid Empire general Nicanor in 161 BC by Judas Maccabeus, the leader of the Maccabees.

2 Maccabees was originally written in Koine Greek by an unknown diaspora Jew living in Hellenistic Egypt. It was likely written some time between 150 and 100 BC. Together with the book 1 Maccabees, it is one of the most important sources on the Maccabean Revolt. The work is not a sequel to 1 Maccabees but rather its own independent rendition of the historical events of the Maccabean Revolt. It both starts and ends its history earlier than 1 Maccabees, beginning with an incident with the Seleucid official Heliodorus attempting to tax the Second Temple in 178 BC, and ending with the Battle of Adasa in 161 BC. Some scholars believe the book to be influenced by the Pharisaic tradition, with sections that include an endorsement of prayer for the dead and a resurrection of the dead.

The book, like the other Books of the Maccabees, was included in the Septuagint, a prominent Greek collection of Jewish scripture. It was not promptly translated to Hebrew or included in the Masoretic Hebrew canon, the Tanakh. While possibly read by Greek-speaking Jews in the two centuries after its creation, later Jews did not consider the work canonical or important. Early Christians did honor the work, and it was included as a deuterocanonical work of the Old Testament. Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Christians still consider the work deuterocanonical; Protestant Christians do not regard 2 Maccabees as canonical, although many include 2 Maccabees as part of the biblical apocrypha, noncanonical books useful for the purpose of edification.

== Authorship and composition date ==
The author of 2 Maccabees is not identified, but he claims to be abridging a 5-volume work by Jason of Cyrene. This longer work is not preserved, and it is uncertain how much of the present text of 2 Maccabees is copied from Jason&#x27;s work. The author wrote in Greek, as there is no particular evidence of an earlier Hebrew version. A few sections of the book, such as the Preface, Epilogue, and some reflections on morality are generally assumed to come from the author, not from Jason. Scholars disagree on both when Jason&#x27;s work was written and when 2 Maccabees was written. Many scholars argue that Jason&#x27;s work was likely published by a contemporary of the Maccabean Revolt, around 160–140 BCE, although all that is known for sure is that it was before 2 Maccabees. Scholars suggest 2 Maccabees was composed at some point from 150–100 BC. It is generally considered that the work must have been written no later than the 70s BC, given that the author seems unaware that Pompey would defeat the Hasmonean kingdom and make Judea a Roman protectorate in 63 BC. The work was possibly modified some after creation, but reached its final form in the Septuagint, the Greek Jewish scriptures. The Septuagint version also gave the work its title of &quot;2 Maccabees&quot; to distinguish it from the other books of the Maccabees in it; the original title of the work, if any, is unknown.

The author appears to be an Egyptian Jew, possibly writing from the capital in Alexandria, addressing other diaspora Jews. The Greek style of the writer is educated and erudite, and he is familiar with the forms of rhetoric and argument of the era. The beginning of the book includes two letters sent by Jews in Jerusalem to Jews of the diaspora in Hellenistic Egypt encouraging the celebration of the feast day set up to honor the purification of the temple (Hanukkah). If the author of the book inserted these letters, the book would have to have been written after 188 SE (~124 BC), the date of the second letter. Some commentators hold that these letters were a later addition, while others consider them the basis for the work.

===Summary===
2 Maccabees both starts and ends its history earlier than 1 Maccabees does, instead covering the period from the high priest Onias III and King Seleucus IV (180 BC) to the defeat of Nicanor in 161. The exact focus of the work is debated. All agree that the work has a moralistic tenor, showing the triumph of Judaism, the supremacy of God, and the just punishment of villains. Some see it as a paean to Judas Maccabeus personally, describing the background of the Revolt to write a biography praising him; some see its focus as the Second Temple, showing its gradual corruption by Antiochus IV and how it was saved and purified; others see the focus as the city of Jerusalem and how it was saved; and others disagree with all of the above, seeing it as written strictly for literary and entertainment value.

The author is interested in providing a theological interpretation of the events; in this book God&#x27;s interventions direct the course of events, punishing the wicked and restoring the Temple to his people. Some events appear to be presented out of strict chronological order to make theological points, such as the occasional &quot;flash forward&quot; to a villain&#x27;s later death. The numbers cited for sizes of armies may also appear exaggerated, though not all of the manuscripts of this book agree.

After the introductory stories of the controversies at the Temple and the persecutions of Antiochus IV, the story switches to its narrative of the Revolt itself. After the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Feast of the Dedication of the Temple is instituted. The Seleucid general Nicanor threatens the newly dedicated Temple. After his death, the festivities for the dedication are concluded. A special day is dedicated to commemorate the Jewish victory in the month of Adar, on the day before &quot;Mordecai&#x27;s Day&quot; (Purim). The work explicitly urges diaspora Jews to celebrate both Hanukkah and Nicanor&#x27;s Day.

===Structure===
2 Maccabees consists of 15 chapters.
*1:1–2:18: Two letters to the Jews of Egypt.
*2:19–32: Epitomist&#x27;s preface.
*Chapter 3: Heliodorus attempts to tax the Temple of Jerusalem&#x27;s treasury, but is repelled. (~178 BC)
*Chapter 4: High Priest Onias III of the Temple of Jerusalem is succeeded by his brother Jason; Jason is then succeeded by the corrupt Menelaus; Onias III is murdered. (~175–170 BC)
*Chapter 5: Jason attempts to overthrow Menelaus. King Antiochus IV Epiphanes returns from the second expedition of the Sixth Syrian War in Egypt, defeats Jason&#x27;s supporters, sacks Jerusalem, loots the Temple treasury, and kills and enslaves local Jews as retribution for the perceived revolt. Jason is forced into exile. (168 BC)
*Chapter 6: The Temple is converted into a syncretic Greek-Jewish worship site. Antiochus IV issues decrees forbidding traditional Jewish practices, such as circumcision, keeping kosher, and keeping the Sabbath. Eleazar the scribe is tortured and killed after refusing to eat pork. (168–167 BC)
*Chapter 7: Martyrdom of the woman and her seven sons after torture by Antiochus IV.
*Chapter 8: Start of the Maccabean Revolt. Judas Maccabeus defeats Nicanor, Gorgias, and Ptolemy son of Dorymenes at the Battle of Emmaus. (~166–165 BC)
*9:1–10:9: Antiochus IV is stricken with disease by God. He belatedly repents and writes a letter attempting to make peace before dying in Persia. Judas conquers Jerusalem, cleanses the Temple, and establishes the festival of Hanukkah. (~164 BC)
*10:10–38: Lysias becomes regent. Governor Ptolemy Macron attempts to cement peace with the Jews, but is undermined by anti-Jewish nobles and commits suicide. The Maccabees campaign in outlying regions against Timothy of Ammon and others. (~163 BC)
*Chapter 11: Lysias leads a military expedition to Judea. Judas defeats him at the Battle of Beth Zur. Four documents detailing negotiations with Lysias and the Roman Republic. (~160s BC)
*Chapter 12: More accounts of the campaigns in outlying regions against Timothy, Gorgias, and others. (~163 BC)
*Chapter 13: Lysias orders the execution of unpopular High Priest Menelaus. Judas harries Lysias&#x27;s expedition with minor victories. Lysias leaves and returns to the capital of Antioch to face the usurper Philip. (~163–162 BC, likely near in time to the Battle of Beth Zechariah described in 1 Maccabees)
*14:1–15:36: Demetrius I becomes King. Alcimus, who had replaced Menelaus as High Priest, is affirmed by Demetrius I. Nicanor is appointed governor of Judea. Nicanor and Judas enter negotiations for peace, but are subverted by Alcimus, who complains to the king; Judas&#x27;s arrest is ordered. Nicanor threatens to destroy the Temple. In a dream vision, Onias III and the prophet Jeremiah give Judas a divine golden sword. At the Battle of Adasa, Judas defeats and kills Nicanor, preserving the sanctity of the Temple. The Day of Nicanor festival is established. (~161 BC)
*15:37–39: Epitomist&#x27;s epilogue.

==Canonicity and theology==
The Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodox Churches regard 2 Maccabees as canonical. Jews and Protestants do not.

===Hellenistic Judaism===
Greek-speaking Jews were the original audience addressed by the work. Both 1 and 2 Maccabees appear in some manuscripts of the Septuagint. Unlike most works in the Septuagint which were Greek translations of Hebrew originals, 2 Maccabees was a Greek work originally. While not a problem for Greek-speaking Hellenistic Jews nor Christians (whose scriptures were written in Greek), other Jews who kept to the Hebrew version of the Jewish Scriptures never included it. Hellenistic Judaism slowly waned as many of its adherents either converted to Christianity or switched to other languages, and 2 Maccabees thus did not become part of the Jewish canon. Josephus, the most famous Jewish writer of the first century whose work was preserved, does not appear to have read 2 Maccabees, for example; neither does Philo of Alexandria. Neither book of the Maccabees were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls of the Essenes, a Jewish sect hostile to the Hasmoneans and their memory. Various works such as Seder Olam Rabbah (a 2nd-century AD work) indicate that the age of prophecy ended with Alexander the Great, and 2 Maccabees, a work clearly written later, thus could not be prophetic.

Traditionally, it was hypothesized that the author of 2 Maccabees might have been influenced by the Pharasaic tradition. The Pharisees emphasized adherence to Jewish law and disputed with the rulers of the Hasmonean kingdom. They criticized how the Hasmoneans took a dual role of both Chief Priest and King, and demanded that they cede one of the titles (usually the kingship, which was expected to be held by one of the family lineage of King David). Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus is recorded as organizing a massacre of his political opponents, and many went into exile. The theory goes that 2 Maccabees praises Judas for saving the temple, but excludes mention of how his brothers and extended family later took the throne, and might have been written by a Pharisee from Judea writing in Egyptian exile. The work&#x27;s emphasis on adherence to the Law even on pain of martyrdom, keeping the Sabbath, and the promise of a future resurrection seem to fit with the Pharisees&#x27; ideology. Still, other scholars disagree that the author shows any signs of such inclinations, and belief in a future resurrection of the dead was not limited to only Pharisees; scholars since the 1980s have tended to be skeptical of the proposed connection.

The theology of the work is an update to the &quot;Deuteronomist&quot; history seen in older Jewish works. The classical Deuteronomist view had been that when Israel is faithful and upholds the covenant, the Jews prosper; when Israel neglects the covenant, God withdraws his favor, and Israel suffers. The persecution of Antiochus IV stood in direct contradiction to this tradition: the most faithful Jews were the ones who suffered the most, while those who abandoned Jewish practices became wealthy and powerful. The author of 2 Maccabees attempts to make sense of this in several ways: he explains that the suffering was a swift and merciful corrective to set the Jews back on the right path. While God had revoked his protection of the Temple in anger at the impious High Priests, his wrath turns to mercy upon seeing the suffering of the martyrs. The work also takes pains to ensure that when setbacks occur, some sort of sin or error was at fault. For those truly blameless, such as the martyrs, the author invokes life after death: that post-mortem rewards and punishments would accomplish what might have been lacking in the mortal world. These references to the resurrection of the dead despite suffering and torture were part of a new current in Judaism also seen in the Book of Daniel, a work the authors of 2 Maccabees were likely familiar with. This would prove especially influential among Roman-era Jews who converted to Christianity.

===Christianity in the era of the Roman Empire===

In the early Christian tradition, the Septuagint was used as the basis for the Christian Old Testament. The inclusion of 2 Maccabees in some copies of the Septuagint saw it a part of various early canon lists and manuscripts, albeit sometimes as part of an appendix. Pope Damasus I&#x27;s Council of Rome in 382, if the 6th century Gelasian Decree is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon which included both 1 and 2 Maccabees, but neither 3 nor 4. 

Pope Innocent I (405 AD), the Synod of Hippo (393 AD), the Council of Carthage (397 AD), the Council of Carthage (419 AD), and the Apostolic Canons all seemed to think that 2 Maccabees was canonical, either by explicitly saying so or citing it as scripture. Jerome and Augustine of Hippo (c. 397 AD) had seemingly inconsistent positions: they directly excluded 2 Maccabees from canon, but did say that the book was useful; yet in other works, both cited 2 Maccabees as if it was scripture, or lists it among scriptural works.

Theologically, the major aspects of 2 Maccabees that resonated with Roman-era Christians and medieval Christians were its stories of martyrology and the resurrection of the dead in its stories of Eleazar and the woman with seven sons. Christians made sermons and comparisons of Christian martyrs to the Maccabean martyrs, along with the hope of an eventual salvation; Eusebius compared the persecuted Christians of Lyon to the Maccabean martyrs, for example. Several churches were dedicated to the &quot;Maccabean martyrs&quot;, and they are among the few pre-Christian figures to appear on the calendar of saints&#x27; days. A cult to the Maccabean martyrs flourished in Antioch, the former capital of the Seleucids; Augustine of Hippo found it ironic and fitting that the city that named Antiochus IV now revered those he persecuted. The one awkward aspect was that the martyrs had died upholding Jewish Law in an era when many Christians felt that the Law of Moses was not merely obsolete, but actively harmful. Christian authors generally downplayed the Jewishness of the martyrs, treating them as proto-Christians instead.

===Controversy in the Reformation era===
2 Maccabees was in a position of being an official part of the canon, but as a deuterocanonical work and thus subtly lesser than the older scriptures during the early 1500s. Josse van Clichtove, in his work &quot;The Veneration of Saints&quot;, cited 2 Maccabees as support for the idea of dead saints interceding for the salvation of the living; in Chapter 15, during a dream vision, both the earlier high priest Onias III and the prophet Jeremiah are said to pray for whole of the people. He also cited 2 Maccabees as support for prayers for the dead, the reverse case of the living praying for the salvation of souls suffering in purgatory.

The book became controversial due to opposition from Martin Luther and other reformers during the Protestant Reformation of the 1500s. Luther had a very high opinion of scripture, but precisely because of this, he wished for the canon to be strict. He would eventually demote the deuterocanonical works to &quot;apocrypha&quot;; still useful to read and part of the 1534 version of the Luther Bible, but set aside in their own separate section and not accepted as a sound basis for Christian doctrine. Luther had several complaints. One was that it was an abridgment of another work, rather than a single divinely inspired author. Another was a general preference for using the Hebrew Bible as the basis for the Old Testament, rather than the Latin Vulgate or the Greek Septuagint. Another was with the prevailing Catholic interpretation and use of one story: that of Judas making a &quot;sin offering&quot; of silver after some of his troops were slain and found with idols, so that the dead might be delivered from their sin. This passage was used as an example of the efficacy of monetary indulgences paid to the Catholic Church to free souls from purgatory by some Catholic authors of the period. Luther disagreed with both indulgences and the concept of purgatory, and in his 1530 work &quot;Disavowl of Purgatory&quot;, he denied that 2 Maccabees was a valid source to cite. Luther was reported as having said: &quot;I am so great an enemy to the second book of the Maccabees, and to Esther, that I wish they had not come to us at all, for they have too many heathen unnaturalities.&quot; The reformer Jean Calvin agreed with Luther&#x27;s criticism of 2 Maccabees, and added his own criticism as well. Calvin propounded predestination, the doctrine that God has chosen the elect, and nothing can change this. Thus, the arguments from Clichtove and other Catholics that cited 2 Maccabees for the doctrine of the intercession of saints was suspect to him: for Calvin, salvation was strictly God&#x27;s choice, and not a matter that dead saints could intervene on. Another issue Calvin and other Protestants raised was the self-effacing epilogue to 2 Maccabees, which Calvin took as an admission from the epitomist that he was not divinely inspired.

In response to this, the Catholic Church went the opposite direction. While earlier Church Fathers had considered the deuterocanonical books useful but lesser than the main scriptures, the Catholic Church now affirmed that 2 Maccabees (and other deuterocanonical works) were in fact fully reliable as scripture at the Council of Trent in 1546.

===Modern status===
2 Maccabees is still used to endorse the doctrine of resurrection of the dead, intercession of saints, and prayers for the dead to be released from purgatory in the Catholic tradition. The Latin Church Lectionary makes use of texts from 2 Maccabees 6 and 7, along with texts from 1 Maccabees 1 to 6, in the weekday readings for the 33rd week in Ordinary Time, in year 1 of the two-year cycle of readings, always in November, and as one of the options available for readings during a Mass for the Dead.

The Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches consider the book canonical. As in antiquity, the most notable section remains the martyrs, who are celebrated as saints by a variety of feast days. They are especially honored in Syriac Christianity, perhaps due to suffering persecution themselves; the mother of seven sons is known as Marth Shmouni in that tradition.

In the Protestant tradition, the book is regarded non-canonical, though it is traditionally included in the intertestamental Apocrypha section of the Bible (especially those used by Lutherans and Anglicans). As with the Lutheran Churches, Article VI of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England and the wider Anglican Communion defines 2 Maccabees as useful but not the basis of doctrine. Scripture readings from the Apocrypha are included in the lectionaries of the Lutheran Churches and Anglican Communion.

The texts regarding the martyrdoms under Antiochus IV in 2 Maccabees are held in high esteem by the Anabaptists, who faced persecution in their history.

==Literary influence==

The most influential part of 2 Maccabees was its stories of the martyrdom of Eleazar and the woman with seven sons; various works expanded the story to add more details such as the woman&#x27;s name (variously called Hannah, Miriam, Shmouni, and other names) and their story. A prominent early example is the book of 4 Maccabees, written by a 1st-century Jewish author who used 2 Maccabees as a direct source (as well as the Book of Daniel). 4 Maccabees discusses in detail the martyrdoms described in 2 Maccabees, but provides a different interpretation of them. While 2 Maccabees attempts to arouse sympathy and emotions (&quot;pathos&quot;), 4 Maccabees was written by someone schooled in Stoic philosophy. As such, in its depiction, the martyred woman and Eleazar calmly discuss matters with their oppressors; they use reason and intellectual argument to stay calm and defy Antiochus IV. 4 Maccabees takes the idea of the resurrection of the dead even more directly than 2 Maccabees and Daniel: if God will revive those who suffer for obeying God&#x27;s law, then it makes perfect sense to obey the greater ruler rather than the lesser ruler.

To a lesser degree, the book 3 Maccabees evinces familiarity with 2 Maccabees; while the setting is different (it is set fifty years before the Maccabean Revolt in Egypt, not Judea), Eleazar the scribe appears in it, and the depictions of turmoil and suffering among Egyptian Jews are influenced by 2 Maccabees. The Christian Epistle to the Hebrews possibly makes a reference to 2 Maccabees as well, or has similar knowledge of the Maccabean martyr tradition.

A later work that directly expanded 2 Maccabees was the &quot;Yosippon&quot; of the 10th century, which includes a paraphrase of parts of the Latin translation of 2 Maccabees. Among Jews, there had been practically no interest in 2 Maccabees itself for a millennium; the &quot;Yosippon&quot; was a rare exception of medieval Jews rediscovering the work. Much like in Christian works, the story of the mother and her seven sons was the most retold and influential.

==Reliability as history==
2 Maccabees has traditionally been considered a somewhat lesser source on the history of the Maccabean Revolt than 1 Maccabees by secular historians, especially in the 19th century. This is for a number of reasons: it wears its religious moralizing openly; it skips around in time and place at parts, rather than the chronological approach in 1 Maccabees; and it includes a number of implausible claims directly in contention with 1 Maccabees. In general, most scholars continue to agree that 1 Maccabees is a superior source on the military history of the revolt: it was written by a Judean who names and describes locations accurately compared to the occasional geographic blunders of 2 Maccabees written by an Egyptian, includes far more details on maneuvers and tactics than the simple depictions of battle in 2 Maccabees, and its figures for elements such as troop counts and casualties are considered more reliable than the wildly inflated numbers in 2 Maccabees. (For example, 2 Maccabees implausibly claims that there were 35,000 Syrian casualties at the Battle of Adasa, a number likely far larger than the entire Seleucid force.) 2 Maccabees was also written in a &quot;pathetic&quot; in the sense of &quot;pathos&quot; style, appealing to emotions and sentiment. Skeptical historians considered this a sign that the epitomist was not interested in historical accuracy much, but merely telling a good story.

In the 20th century, there was a renewed interest in rehabilitating 2 Maccabees as a source on par with 1 Maccabees by scholars. In particular, there was a growing recognition that a politically slanted history, as 1 Maccabees is, could be just as biased and unreliable as the religiously slanted history that 2 Maccabees is. A deeply devout observer could still be describing true events, albeit with a religious interpretation of them. By the 1930s, historians generally came to the conclusion that the historical documents present in 2 Maccabees – while seemingly out of chronological order – were likely legitimate and matched what would be expected of such Seleucid negotiations. Archaeological evidence supported many of the references made to Seleucid leadership, causing historians to think that Jason and the epitomist must have had better knowledge of internal Seleucid affairs than the author of 1 Maccabees. As an example, 2 Maccabees appears to be more reliable and honest on the date of the death of Antiochus IV. Archaeological evidence supports the claim in 2 Maccabees he died before the cleansing of the Temple, while 1 Maccabees moves his death later to hide the fact that Lysias abandoned his campaign in Judea not due to the efforts of the Maccabees at the Battle of Beth Zur, but rather to respond to political turmoil resulting from Antiochus&#x27;s death. In 2 Maccabees, it is written that Antiochus&#x27;s decrees were targeted against Judea and Samaria, which historians find more likely than the claim in 1 Maccabees that he demanded religious standardization across the entire empire.

Even to the extent that 2 Maccabees is still distrusted as history to a degree, the fact that it is a genuinely independent source is considered invaluable to historians. Many events in the Hellenistic and Roman periods have only passing mentions that they occurred; those that do have a detailed source often only have a single such detailed source, leaving it difficult to determine that author&#x27;s biases or errors. For example, the Great Revolt against the Romans in 64–73 AD is only closely recorded by Josephus&#x27;s &quot;The Jewish War&quot;. The Maccabean Revolt having two independent detailed contemporary histories is a rarity.

== Manuscripts ==
Early manuscripts of the Septuagint were not uniform in their lists of books. 2 Maccabees is found in the 5th century Codex Alexandrinus which includes all of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Maccabees, as well as the 8th century Codex Venetus. 2 Maccabees is missing from the Codex Vaticanus (which lacks any of the books of Maccabees) and the Codex Sinaiticus (which includes 1 and 4 Maccabees, but neither 2 nor 3 Maccabees). Additionally, other ancient fragments have been found, albeit with some attributed to Lucian of Antioch who is considered to have &quot;improved&quot; some of his renditions with unknown other material, leading to variant readings. Pre-modern Latin, Syriac, and Armenian translations exist, as well as a fragment in Akhmimic Coptic, but they mostly match the Greek, or the Lucianic renditions of the Greek in the case of the Syriac versions. Robert Hanhart created a critical edition of the Greek text in 1959 with a second edition published in 1976.

<doc id="316392" wikidata="Q942995" url="?curid=316392" title="Okakura Kakuzō">
<text>, also known as Okakura Tenshin , was a Japanese scholar and art critic who in the era of Meiji Restoration reform promoted a critical appreciation of traditional forms, customs and beliefs. Outside Japan, he is chiefly renowned for &quot;The Book of Tea: A Japanese Harmony of Art, Culture, and the Simple Life&quot; (1906). Written in English, and in the wake of the Russo-Japanese War, it decried Western caricaturing of the Japanese, and of Asians more generally, and expressed the fear that Japan gained respect only to the extent that it adopted the barbarities of Western militarism.

==Early life and education==
The second son of Okakura Kan&#x27;emon, a former Fukui Domain treasurer turned silk merchant, and Kan&#x27;emon&#x27;s second wife, Kakuzō was named for the corner warehouse (角蔵) in which he was born, but later changed the spelling of his name to different Kanji meaning &quot;awakened boy&quot; (覚三).

Okakura learned English while attending Yoshisaburō, a school operated by a Christian missionary, Dr. James Curtis Hepburn, of the Hepburn romanization system. Here, he became well-versed in the foreign language but couldn&#x27;t read Kanji, the characters of his homeland. As such, his father got him to concurrently study western culture at Yoshisaburō and traditional Japanese in a Buddhist temple. After the abolishment of the feudal system in 1871, his family moved from Yokohama to Tokyo. In 1875, Okakura joined them and won a scholarship to the Tokyo Institute of Foreign Languages. Quickly after, the school was renamed to Tokyo Imperial University. It was at this prestigious academy that he first met and studied under the Harvard-educated art historian Ernest Fenollosa.

== Career ==
In 1886, Okakura became secretary to the minister of education and was put in charge of musical affairs. Later in the same year he was named to the Imperial Art Commission and sent abroad to study fine arts in the Western world. After his return from Europe and the United States, in 1887 he helped found, and a year later became director of, the Tokyo School of Fine Arts (東京美術学校 &quot;Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō&quot;).

The new arts school represented &quot;the first serious reaction to the lifeless conservatism&quot; of traditionalists and the &quot;equally uninspired imitation of western art&quot; fostered by early Meiji enthusiasts. Limiting himself to more sympathetic aspects of art in the West, at the school, and in a new periodical &quot;Kokka&quot;, Okakura sought to rehabilitate ancient and native arts, honoring their ideals and exploring their possibilities. When, in 1897, it became clear that European methods were to be given ever increasing prominence in the school curriculum, he resigned his directorship. Six months later he renewed the effort, as he saw it, to draw on western art without impairing national inspiration in the Nihon Bijutsuin (日本美術院, lit. &quot;Japan Visual Arts Academy&quot;), founded with Hashimoto Gahō and Yokoyama Taikan and thirty-seven other leading artists.

At the same time, Okakura had opposed the Shintoist &quot;Haibutsu Kishaku&quot; movement which, in the wake of the Meiji Restoration had sought to expel Buddhism from Japan. With Ernest Fenollosa, he worked to repair damaged Buddhist temples, images and texts.

Okakura was a high-profile urbanite who retained an international sense of self. He wrote all of his main works in English. Okakura researched Japan&#x27;s traditional art and traveled to Europe, the United States and China, and lived two years in India during which he engaged in dialogue with Swami Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore. Okakura emphasised the importance to the modern world of Asian culture, attempting to bring its influence to realms of art and literature that, in his day, were largely dominated by Western culture. In 1906, he was invited by William Sturgis Bigelow to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and became the Curator of its Department of Japanese and Chinese Art in 1910.

== Works ==
His 1903 book on Asian artistic and cultural history, &quot;The Ideals of the East with Special Reference to the Art of Japan&quot;, published on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, is famous for its opening paragraph in which he sees a spiritual unity throughout Asia, which distinguishes it from the West:

Asia is one. The Himalayas divide, only to accentuate, two mighty civilisations, the Chinese with its communism of Confucius, and the Indian with its individualism of the Vedas. But not even the snowy barriers can interrupt for one moment that broad expanse of love for the Ultimate and Universal, which is the common thought-inheritance of every Asiatic race, enabling them to produce all the great religions of the world, and distinguishing them from those maritime peoples of the Mediterranean and the Baltic, who love to dwell on the Particular, and to search out the means, not the end, of life.

In his subsequent book, &quot;The Awakening of Japan&quot;, published in 1904, he argued that &quot;the glory of the West is the humiliation of Asia.&quot; This was an early expression of Pan-Asianism. In this book Okakura also noted that Japan&#x27;s rapid modernization was not universally applauded in Asia: ″We have become so eager to identify ourselves with European civilization instead of Asiatic that our continental neighbors regard us as renegades—nay, even as an embodiment of the White Disaster itself.&quot;

In &quot;The Book of Tea&quot;, written and published in 1906, has been described as &quot;the earliest lucid English-language account of Zen Buddhism and its relation to the arts&quot;. Okakura argued that &quot;Tea is more than an idealization of the form of drinking; it is a religion of the art of life&quot;.

[Teaism] insulates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.

None of this, he suggested, was appreciated by the Westerner. In his &quot;sleek complacency&quot;, the Westerner views the tea ceremony as &quot;but another instance of the thousand and one oddities which constitute the quaintness and childishness of the East to him&quot;. Writing in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, Okakura commented that the Westerner regarded Japan as &quot;barbarous while she indulged in the gentle arts of peace&quot;, and began to call her civilized only when &quot;she began to commit wholesale slaughter on the Manchurian battlefields&quot;.

Okakura&#x27;s final work, &quot;The White Fox&quot;, written under the patronage of Isabella Stewart Gardner in 1912, was an English-language libretto for the Boston Opera House. The libretto incorporates elements from both kabuki plays and Wagner&#x27;s epic &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and may be understood, metaphorically, as an expression of Okakura&#x27;s hoped-for reconciliation of East and West. Charles Martin Loeffler agreed to Garner&#x27;s request to put the poetic drama to music, but the project was never staged.

== Death ==
Okakura&#x27;s health deteriorated in his later years. &quot;My ailment the doctors say is the usual complaint of the twentieth century—Bright&#x27;s disease,&quot; he wrote a friend in June 1913. &quot;I have eaten things in various parts of the globe—too varied for the hereditary notions of my stomach and kidneys. However I am getting well again and I am thinking of going to China in September.&quot; In August, 1913, &quot;Kakuzo insisted on going to his mountain villa in Akakura, and finally his wife, daughter and his sister took him there by train. For a week or so, Kakuzo felt a little better and was able to talk with people, but on August 25, he had a heart attack and spent several days in great pain. Surrounded by his family, relatives and his disciples, he passed away on September 2.&quot;

In Japan, Okakura, along with Fenollosa, is credited with &quot;saving&quot; Nihonga, or painting done with traditional Japanese technique, as it was threatened with replacement by Western-style painting, or &quot;Yōga&quot;, whose chief advocate was artist Kuroda Seiki. In fact this role, most assiduously pressed after Okakura&#x27;s death by his followers, is not taken seriously by art scholars today, nor is the idea that oil painting posed any serious &quot;threat&quot; to traditional Japanese painting. Yet Okakura was certainly instrumental in modernizing Japanese aesthetics, having recognized the need to preserve Japan&#x27;s cultural heritage, and thus was one of the major reformers during Japan&#x27;s period of modernization beginning with the Meiji Restoration.

Outside Japan, Okakura influenced a number of important figures, directly or indirectly, who include Swami Vivekananda, philosopher Martin Heidegger, poet Ezra Pound, and especially poet Rabindranath Tagore and art benefactor, collector and museum founder Isabella Stewart Gardner, who were close personal friends of his. He was also one of a trio of Japanese artists who introduced the wash technique to Abanindranath Tagore, the father of modern Indian watercolor.

As part of the Izura Institute of Arts &amp; Culture, Ibaraki University manages &quot;Rokkakudō&quot;, an hexagonal wooden retreat overlooking the sea along the Izura coast in Kitaibaraki, Ibaraki Prefecture, that was designed by Okakura and built in 1905. It is registered as a national monument.

<text>The basic principles of air navigation are identical to general navigation, which includes the process of planning, recording, and controlling the movement of a craft from one place to another.

Successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, not breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the ground. Air navigation differs from the navigation of surface craft in several ways; Aircraft travel at relatively high speeds, leaving less time to calculate their position en route. Aircraft normally cannot stop in mid-air to ascertain their position at leisure. Aircraft are safety-limited by the amount of fuel they can carry; a surface vehicle can usually get lost, run out of fuel, then simply await rescue. There is no in-flight rescue for most aircraft. Additionally, collisions with obstructions are usually fatal. Therefore, constant awareness of position is critical for aircraft pilots.

The techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules (IFR). In the latter case, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons, or as directed under radar control by air traffic control. In the former case, a pilot will largely navigate using &quot;dead reckoning&quot; combined with visual observations (known as pilotage), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids or satellite based positioning systems.

== Route planning ==


The first step in navigation is deciding where one wishes to go. A private pilot planning a flight under VFR will usually use an aeronautical chart of the area which is published specifically for the use of pilots. This map will depict controlled airspace, radio navigation aids and airfields prominently, as well as hazards to flying such as mountains, tall radio masts, etc. It also includes sufficient ground detail – towns, roads, wooded areas – to aid visual navigation. In the UK, the CAA publishes a series of maps covering the whole of the UK at various scales, updated annually. The information is also updated in the notices to airmen, or NOTAMs.

The pilot will choose a route, taking care to avoid controlled airspace that is not permitted for the flight, restricted areas, danger areas and so on. The chosen route is plotted on the map, and the lines drawn are called the &quot;track&quot;. The aim of all subsequent navigation is to follow the chosen track as accurately as possible. Occasionally, the pilot may elect on one leg to follow a clearly visible feature on the ground such as a railway track, river, highway, or coast.

When an aircraft is in flight, it is moving relative to the body of air through which it is flying; therefore maintaining an accurate ground track is not as easy as it might appear, unless there is no wind at all—a very rare occurrence. The pilot must adjust heading to compensate for the wind, in order to follow the ground track. Initially the pilot will calculate headings to fly for each leg of the trip prior to departure, using the forecast wind directions and speeds supplied by the meteorological authorities for the purpose. These figures are generally accurate and updated several times per day, but the unpredictable nature of the weather means that the pilot must be prepared to make further adjustments in flight. A general aviation (GA) pilot will often make use of either a flight computer – a type of slide rule – or a purpose-designed electronic navigational computer to calculate initial headings.

The primary instrument of navigation is the magnetic compass. The needle or card aligns itself to magnetic north, which does not coincide with true north, so the pilot must also allow for this, called the magnetic variation (or declination). The variation that applies locally is also shown on the flight map. Once the pilot has calculated the actual headings required, the next step is to calculate the flight times for each leg. This is necessary to perform accurate dead reckoning. The pilot also needs to take into account the slower initial airspeed during climb to calculate the time to top of climb. It is also helpful to calculate the top of descent, or the point at which the pilot would plan to commence the descent for landing.

The flight time will depend on both the desired cruising speed of the aircraft, and the wind – a tailwind will shorten flight times, a headwind will increase them. The flight computer has scales to help pilots compute these easily.

The point of no return, sometimes referred to as the PNR, is the point on a flight at which a plane has just enough fuel, plus any mandatory reserve, to return to the airfield from which it departed. Beyond this point that option is closed, and the plane must proceed to some other destination. Alternatively, with respect to a large region without airfields, e.g. an ocean, it can mean the point before which it is closer to turn around and after which it is closer to continue. Similarly, the Equal time point, referred to as the ETP (also critical point), is the point in the flight where it would take the same time to continue flying straight, or track back to the departure aerodrome. The ETP is not dependent on fuel, but wind, giving a change in ground speed out from, and back to the departure aerodrome. In Nil wind conditions, the ETP is located halfway between the two aerodromes, but in reality it is shifted depending on the windspeed and direction.

The aircraft that is flying across the Ocean for example, would be required to calculate ETPs for one engine inoperative, depressurization, and a normal ETP; all of which could actually be different points along the route. For example, in one engine inoperative and depressurization situations the aircraft would be forced to lower operational altitudes, which would affect its fuel consumption, cruise speed and ground speed. Each situation therefore would have a different ETP.

Commercial aircraft are not allowed to operate along a route that is out of range of a suitable place to land if an emergency such as an engine failure occurs. The ETP calculations serve as a planning strategy, so flight crews always have an &#x27;out&#x27; in an emergency event, allowing a safe diversion to their chosen alternate.

The final stage is to note which areas the route will pass through or over, and to make a note of all of the things to be done – which ATC units to contact, the appropriate frequencies, visual reporting points, and so on. It is also important to note which pressure setting regions will be entered, so that the pilot can ask for the QNH (air pressure) of those regions. Finally, the pilot should have in mind some alternative plans in case the route cannot be flown for some reason – unexpected weather conditions being the most common. At times the pilot may be required to file a flight plan for an alternate destination and to carry adequate fuel for this. The more work a pilot can do on the ground prior to departure, the easier it will be in the air.

=== IFR planning ===
Instrument flight rules (IFR) navigation is similar to visual flight rules (VFR) flight planning except that the task is generally made simpler by the use of special charts that show IFR routes from beacon to beacon with the lowest safe altitude (LSALT), bearings (in both directions), and distance marked for each route. IFR pilots may fly on other routes but they then must perform all such calculations themselves; the LSALT calculation is the most difficult. The pilot then needs to look at the weather and minimum specifications for landing at the destination airport and the alternate requirements. Pilots must also comply with all the rules including their legal ability to use a particular instrument approach depending on how recently they last performed one.

In recent years, strict beacon-to-beacon flight paths have started to be replaced by routes derived through performance-based navigation (PBN) techniques. When operators develop flight plans for their aircraft, the PBN approach encourages them to assess the overall accuracy, integrity, availability, continuity, and functionality of the aggregate navigation aids present within the applicable airspace. Once these determinations have been made, the operator develops a route that is the most time and fuel efficient while respecting all applicable safety concerns—thereby maximizing both the aircraft&#x27;s and the airspace&#x27;s overall performance capabilities.

Under the PBN approach, technologies evolve over time (e.g., ground beacons become satellite beacons) without requiring the underlying aircraft operation to be recalculated. Also, navigation specifications used to assess the sensors and equipment that are available in an airspace can be cataloged and shared to inform equipment upgrade decisions and the ongoing harmonization of the world&#x27;s various air navigation systems.

== In flight ==
Once in flight, the pilot must take pains to stick to plan, otherwise getting lost is all too easy. This is especially true if flying in the dark or over featureless terrain. This means that the pilot must stick to the calculated headings, heights and speeds as accurately as possible, unless flying under visual flight rules. The visual pilot must regularly compare the ground with the map, (pilotage) to ensure that the track is being followed although adjustments are generally calculated and planned. Usually, the pilot will fly for some time as planned to a point where features on the ground are easily recognised. If the wind is different from that expected, the pilot must adjust heading accordingly, but this is not done by guesswork, but by mental calculation – often using the 1 in 60 rule. For example, a two degree error at the halfway stage can be corrected by adjusting heading by four degrees the other way to arrive in position at the end of the leg. This is also a point to reassess the estimated time for the leg. A good pilot will become adept at applying a variety of techniques to stay on track.

While the compass is the primary instrument used to determine one&#x27;s heading, pilots will usually refer instead to the direction indicator (DI), a gyroscopically driven device which is much more stable than a compass. The compass reading will be used to correct for any drift (precession) of the DI periodically. The compass itself will only show a steady reading when the aircraft has been in straight and level flight long enough to allow it to settle.

Should the pilot be unable to complete a leg – for example bad weather arises, or the visibility falls below the minima permitted by the pilot&#x27;s license, the pilot must &quot;divert&quot; to another route. Since this is an unplanned leg, the pilot must be able to mentally calculate suitable headings to give the desired new track. Using the flight computer in flight is usually impractical, so mental techniques to give rough and ready results are used. The wind is usually allowed for by assuming that sine A = A, for angles less than 60° (when expressed in terms of a fraction of 60° – e.g. 30° is 1/2 of 60°, and sine 30° = 0.5), which is adequately accurate. A method for computing this mentally is the clock code. However the pilot must be extra vigilant when flying diversions to maintain awareness of position.

Some diversions can be temporary – for example to skirt around a local storm cloud. In such cases, the pilot can turn 60 degrees away his desired heading for a given period of time. Once clear of the storm, he can then turn back in the opposite direction 120 degrees, and fly this heading for the same length of time. This is a &#x27;wind-star&#x27; maneuver and, with no winds aloft, will place him back on his original track with his trip time increased by the length of one diversion leg.

Another reason for not relying on the magnetic compass during flight, apart from calibrating the Heading indicator from time to time, is because magnetic compasses are subject to errors caused by flight conditions and other internal and external interferences on the magnet system.

== Navigation aids ==


Many GA aircraft are fitted with a variety of navigation aids, such as Automatic direction finder (ADF), inertial navigation, compasses, radar navigation, VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and Global navigation satellite system (GNSS).

ADF uses non-directional beacons (NDBs) on the ground to drive a display which shows the direction of the beacon from the aircraft. The pilot may use this bearing to draw a line on the map to show the bearing from the beacon. By using a second beacon, two lines may be drawn to locate the aircraft at the intersection of the lines. This is called a cross-cut. Alternatively, if the track takes the flight directly overhead a beacon, the pilot can use the ADF instrument to maintain heading relative to the beacon, though &quot;following the needle&quot; is bad practice, especially in the presence of a strong cross wind – the pilot&#x27;s actual track will spiral in towards the beacon, not what was intended. NDBs also can give erroneous readings because they use very long wavelengths, which are easily bent and reflected by ground features and the atmosphere. NDBs continue to be used as a common form of navigation in some countries with relatively few navigational aids.

VOR is a more sophisticated system, and is still the primary air navigation system established for aircraft flying under IFR in those countries with many navigational aids. In this system, a beacon emits a specially modulated signal which consists of two sine waves which are out of phase. The phase difference corresponds to the actual bearing relative to magnetic north (in some cases true north) that the receiver is from the station. The upshot is that the receiver can determine with certainty the exact bearing from the station. Again, a cross-cut is used to pinpoint the location. Many VOR stations also have additional equipment called DME (distance measuring equipment) which will allow a suitable receiver to determine the exact distance from the station. Together with the bearing, this allows an exact position to be determined from a single beacon alone. For convenience, some VOR stations also transmit local weather information which the pilot can listen in to, perhaps generated by an Automated Surface Observing System. A VOR which is co-located with a DME is usually a component of a TACAN.

Prior to the advent of GNSS, Celestial Navigation was also used by trained navigators. This was especially true on military bombers and transport aircraft in the event of all electronic navigational aids being turned off in time of war. Originally navigators used an astrodome and regular sextant or bubble octant but the more streamlined periscopic sextant was used from the 1940s to the 1990s. From the 1970s airliners used inertial navigation systems, especially on inter-continental routes, until the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983 prompted the US government to make GPS available for civilian use.

Finally, an aircraft may be supervised from the ground using surveillance information from e.g. radar or multilateration. ATC can then feed back information to the pilot to help establish position, or can actually tell the pilot the position of the aircraft, depending on the level of ATC service the pilot is receiving.

The use of GNSS in aircraft is becoming increasingly common. GNSS provides very precise aircraft position, altitude, heading and ground speed information. GNSS makes navigation precision once reserved to large RNAV-equipped aircraft available to the GA pilot. Recently, many airports include GNSS instrument approaches. GNSS approaches consist of either overlays to existing precision and non-precision approaches or stand-alone GNSS approaches. Approaches having the lowest decision heights generally require that GNSS be augmented by a second system—e.g., the FAA&#x27;s Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).

== Flight navigator ==
Civilian flight navigators (a mostly redundant aircrew position, also called &#x27;air navigator&#x27; or &#x27;flight navigator&#x27;), were employed on older aircraft, typically between the late-1910s and the 1970s. The crew member, occasionally two navigation crew members for some flights, was responsible for the trip navigation, including its dead reckoning and celestial navigation. This was especially essential when trips were flown over oceans or other large bodies of water, where radio navigation aids were not originally available. (satellite coverage is now provided worldwide). As sophisticated electronic and GNSS systems came online, the navigator&#x27;s position was discontinued and its function was assumed by dual-licensed pilot-navigators, and still later by the flight&#x27;s primary pilots (Captain and First Officer), resulting in a downsizing in the number of aircrew positions for commercial flights. As the installation of electronic navigation systems into the Captain&#x27;s and FO&#x27;s instrument panels was relatively straight forward, the navigator&#x27;s position in commercial aviation (but not necessarily military aviation) became redundant. (Some countries task their air forces to fly without navigation aids during wartime, thus still requiring a navigator&#x27;s position). Most civilian air navigators were retired or made redundant by the early 1980s.

<doc id="316397" wikidata="Q1166157" url="?curid=316397" title="Toyota Center">
<text>Toyota Center is an indoor arena located in Houston, Texas, United States. It is named after the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota. The arena is home to the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and it was once the home of the Houston Aeros of the American Hockey League (AHL), and the Houston Comets of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA).

Rockets owner Leslie Alexander first began to request a new arena in 1995 and attempted to release the Rockets from their lease at The Summit, which ran until 2003. However, he was denied by arena owner Chuck Watson, then-owner of the Aeros, who also wanted control of a new arena. The two sides agreed to equal control over an arena in a deal signed in 1997, but the proposal was rejected by city voters in a 1999 referendum. It was not until the city and the Rockets signed an amended agreement in 2001, excluding the Aeros, that the proposal was accepted.

Construction began in July 2001, and the new arena was officially opened in October 2003. The total costs were $235 million, with the city of Houston paying the majority, and the Rockets paying for enhancements. Toyota paid US$100 million for the naming rights.

==History==
In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, including the Houston Rockets, proposed legislation that would dedicate state tax revenue to build new arenas. Although the bill failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced he would continue to study the possibility of constructing a new arena in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit&#x27;s management said they could renovate the building for a small part of the cost of a new arena, the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.

As the negotiations continued into 1996, a panel appointed by Houston mayor Bob Lanier reported that building a new arena was &quot;essential to keep pro sports in Houston&quot;. After Watson rejected a contract buyout proposal of $30 million, the Rockets filed a legal challenge against their lease, stating the &quot;need to be able to buy out&quot; of the lease. However, the city of Houston filed a counterclaim to force the Rockets to stay at the Summit, saying that if the Rockets did not honor their contract, then they might &quot;have no incentive to honor any new agreement with the city of Houston to play in a new downtown sports arena&quot;. The validity of the lease was eventually upheld, and in April 1997, Lanier announced that the Rockets and Watson would have to agree to share control of the new arena equally, or lose access to it altogether. After both parties agreed to the terms, a bill that authorized increased taxes to pay for a new arena was signed into law in July, by then-Governor George W. Bush.

However, after the NHL decided not to consider Houston as a location for an expansion team because of the indecision over the new arena, Lanier said that he would not have a referendum in November. The Rockets began an appeal in January 1998 against the court order to stay at the Summit, but then dropped it in May, because they felt that a new arena would be ready by the time they finished their lease. In January 1999, recently elected mayor Lee Brown guaranteed a referendum on the issue before the end of the year. After several months negotiating with the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority, the Rockets finalized a deal to pay half of the constructions costs, and a referendum was set for November 2. The deal was approved by Brown and the Houston City Council, but Watson started an opposition group against the referendum, saying the arena was &quot;not in Houston&#x27;s interest&quot;. On November 3, the results of the referendum were announced, and the arena proposal was rejected by 54% of voters. Alexander said &quot;we never thought we would lose&quot; and that they were &quot;devastated by the loss&quot;.

After the vote, NBA commissioner David Stern said &quot;if there&#x27;s not a new building...I think it&#x27;s certain that the team will be relocated.&quot; The Houston Sports Authority had not planned to meet with the Rockets until after the NBA season ended, but after the Rockets began to talk to other cities about relocation, they resumed talks in February 2000. Although the Rockets continued to negotiate with Louisville, Kentucky, a funding plan for the arena in Houston was released in June. A final agreement was proposed on July 6, and both the Rockets and mayor Brown agreed to the terms. After the city council approved the deal, the proposal was placed on the November referendum ballot. Leading up to the vote, the Rockets stressed that there would be &quot;no new taxes of any kind&quot;, although opponents said the new arena would raise energy consumption, and also contended that the public would pay for too much of the costs of the arena. Contributions for the campaign for the arena included donations of US$400,000 from Reliant Energy, and a total of $590,000 in loans and contributions from Enron and Ken Lay, who the Rockets said was a &quot;tireless&quot; force in the campaign. On November 8, the arena was approved by 66% of voters.

===Construction===

According to the agreement signed, the city of Houston bought the land for the arena and an adjoining parking garage, which was near the George R. Brown Convention Center, and paid for it by selling bonds and borrowing $30 million. Morris Architects, designed the building, and Hunt Construction was contracted to build the arena. A building formerly owned by Houston Lighting and Power Company was demolished to make way for the arena, and two streets were closed for the duration of the construction. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 31, 2001, and construction continued for 26 months.

At the request of Alexander, the arena was built below street level, so fans would not have to walk up stairs to reach their seats. To sink the arena, $12 million was spent to excavate of dirt over four months, which was the largest excavation in Houston history. Concrete was poured for the foundation throughout the summer of 2002, and structural work began in October. The roof was set on in December, as work continued inside, with a peak workforce of 650. In September 2003, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held to mark the official opening of the arena. The total cost of construction was $235 million, with the city paying $182 million, and the Rockets adding $43 million for additions and enhancements.

==Arena interior==
The arena can seat 18,104 for a basketball game, 17,800 for ice hockey games, and 19,300 for concerts. The prices for courtside seats to a Rockets game in the new arena were raised by as much as 50% compared to prices in the team&#x27;s old home, while upper-deck seat prices were lowered.

It has 103 luxury suites and 2,900 club seats (Sections 105–109, Frost Bank West Club; Sections 118–122, Frost Bank East Club). The Rockets East &amp; West Clubs feature upscale concessions, extra wide seats, full private bar featuring premium wine and beverage selections and concierge service. The adjacent 2,500-space Toyota Tundra garage is connected to the arena by a private skybridge that can be accessed by Suite, Court-side and Club Seat holders.

Additionally, the floor level features three separate private club lounges for access from court-side seat holders and floor seat concert goers. Lexus Lounge and Golden Nugget Club are on the west side of the floor level and the Bogarts Platinum Lounge is located on the east side of the floor level. All feature upscale amenities including multiple flat screen televisions, private bar, restrooms, and plush seating. The Lexus Lounge has its own pool tables and all three court-side lounges feature numerous private court-side suites.

Toyota Center also features the Sterling Vineyards Red &amp; White Wine Bistro, located on the lower suites level on the south side of the arena. The restaurant features a huge dining room, private bar, two twin 1,500 bottle wine towers and views of the arena floor.

Levy Restaurants manages concession services at the arena, and offers fast food on the main concourses, while also catering a VIP restaurant for Suite and Club Seat holders. Alexander personally chose colors for the restaurant to help customers feel &quot;warm and comfortable&quot;, and Rockets president George Postolos said that the Rockets looked &quot;for a relationship with the people that attend events in our venue&quot;. Originally, a by centerhung video system from Daktronics, which has four main replay screens and eight other full-color displays, hung from the ceiling of the arena, and had the highest-resolution display of any North American sports facility. In 2012, Toyota Center installed a larger, 4 panel scoreboard, similar to the one installed at AT&amp;T Stadium, measuring by on the sidelines, and by on the ends, making it the largest such video board in an indoor arena. This larger scoreboard was installed by Panasonic and made its debut during the Houston Rockets 2012–13 season opener. The arena has two additional displays located at each end of the court, and a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; audio system.

Another amenity new to Toyota Center in the 2012–2013 season is Wi-Fi. Designed by SignalShare and implemented by OfficeConnect.net, the Wi-Fi network is deployed throughout the arena and allows high-speed internet access during events. Its implementation was timed to be ready for the NBA All-Star Game.

The logo of the company was placed on the roof of the building, as well in other prominent places inside the arena, and the company was given &quot;a dominant presence&quot; in commercials shown during broadcasts of games played in the arena.

<doc id="316398" wikidata="Q1680145" url="?curid=316398" title="William Barclay (theologian)">
<text>William Barclay CBE (5 December 1907 – 24 January 1978) was a Scottish author, radio and television presenter, Church of Scotland minister, and Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow. He wrote a popular set of Bible commentaries on the New Testament that sold 1.5 million copies.

==Life==
Barclay&#x27;s father was a bank manager. Barclay attended Dalziel High School in Motherwell and then studied classics at the University of Glasgow from 1925 to 1929, before studying divinity. He studied at the University during the year 1932-33. After being ordained in the Church of Scotland in 1933, he was minister at Trinity Church in Renfrew from 1933 to 1946, afterwards returning to the University of Glasgow as lecturer in the New Testament from 1947, and as Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism from 1963.

==Religious views==
Barclay described himself theologically as a &quot;liberal evangelical.&quot; Barclay expressed his personal views in his &quot;A Spiritual Autobiography&quot; (1977), and Clive L. Rawlins elaborates in &quot;William Barclay: prophet of goodwill: the authorised biography&quot; (1998). They included:
* belief in universal salvation: &quot;I am a convinced universalist. I believe that in the end all men will be gathered into the love of God.&quot;
* pacifism: &quot;war is mass murder&quot;.
* evolution: &quot;We believe in evolution, the slow climb upwards of man from the level of the beasts. Jesus is the end and climax of the evolutionary process because in Him men met God.&quot;

The journalist James Douglas suggested Barclay was also &quot;reticent about the inspiration of Scripture, critical of the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, and given to views about the virgin birth and miracles which conservatives would find either heretical or imprecise.&quot;

==Works==
While professor, he decided to dedicate his life to &quot;making the best biblical scholarship available to the average reader&quot;. The eventual result was the &quot;Daily Study Bible&quot;, a set of 17 commentaries on the New Testament, published by Saint Andrew Press, the Church of Scotland&#x27;s publishing house. Despite the series name, these commentaries do not set a program of regular study. Rather, they go verse by verse through Barclay&#x27;s own translation of the New Testament, listing and examining every possible interpretation known to Barclay and providing all the background information he considered possibly relevant, all in layman&#x27;s terms. The commentaries were fully updated with the help of William Barclay&#x27;s son, Ronnie Barclay, in recent years and they are now known as the &quot;New Daily Study Bible&quot; series.

The 17 volumes of the set were all best-sellers and continue to be so to this day. A companion set giving a similar treatment to the Old Testament was endorsed but not written by Barclay.
In 2008 Saint Andrew Press began taking the content of the New Daily Study Bibles and producing pocket-sized thematic titles called &quot;Insights&quot;. The &quot;Insights&quot; books are introduced by contemporary authors, broadcasters and scholars, including Nick Baines and Diane-Louise Jordan.

Barclay wrote many other popular books, always drawing on scholarship but written in a highly accessible style. In &quot;The Mind of Jesus&quot; (1960) he states that his aim was &quot;to make the figure of Jesus more vividly alive, so that we may know him better and love him more&quot;.

Barclay&#x27;s books on the gospels and Jesus include:

* &quot;The Gospels and Acts: Matthew, Mark and Luke&quot;
* &quot;The Gospels and Acts: John and Acts&quot;
* &quot;Discovering Jesus&quot;
* &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (a companion to the miniseries)
* &quot;Jesus As They Saw Him&quot;
* &quot;Crucified and Crowned&quot;
* &quot;The Mind of Jesus&quot;
* &quot;The Parables of Jesus&quot; 
* &quot;The Plain Man Looks at the Beatitudes&quot;
* &quot;The Plain Man Looks at the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; 
* &quot;The Old Law and the New Law&quot;
* &quot;And He Had Compassion: The Miracles of Jesus&quot; (Judson Press)
* &quot;We Have Seen the Lord!&quot;
* &quot;The Master&#x27;s Men&quot;
* &quot;Fishers of Men&quot;

Barclay&#x27;s books on New Testament studies include:

* &quot;The New Testament: A New Translation&quot;
* &quot;A Beginner&#x27;s Guide to the New Testament&quot;
* &quot;The New Daily Study Bible&quot; (17 volumes covering the entire New Testament)
* &quot;Insights&quot; (Series currently extending to 8 titles)

* &quot;Letters to the Seven Churches&quot;
* &quot;The Men, The Meaning, The Message of the Books&quot;
* &quot;Great Themes of the New Testament&quot;
* &quot;New Testament Words&quot;

Barclay also wrote two books on Old Testament passages:

* &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;
* &quot;The Lord is My Shepherd&quot;

Barclay&#x27;s theological introductions include:

* &quot;The Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot; 
* &quot;Conversion&quot;
* &quot;The Promise of the Spirit&quot;
* &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;
* &quot;Ethics in a Permissive Society&quot;
* &quot;At the Last Trumpet: Jesus Christ and the End of Time&quot;

Barclay&#x27;s other books include:

* &quot;Introducing the Bible&quot;
* &quot;Growing in Christian Faith&quot;
* &quot;The Plain Man&#x27;s Book of Prayers&quot;
* &quot;Communicating the Gospel&quot; (reprinted as &quot;Meditations on Communicating the Gospel&quot;)

<doc id="316399" wikidata="Q709678" url="?curid=316399" title="Three Great Nobles of the Restoration">
<text>The is a term used in Japan for three figures that played an important role in the Meiji Restoration in 1868 and are regarded as the founders of the modern state of Japan.

The Three Great Nobles were Ōkubo Toshimichi of the Satsuma Domain (Satsuma-&quot;han),&quot; Saigō Takamori of the Satsuma Domain (Satsuma-&quot;han),&quot; and Kido Takayoshi (also known as Katsura Kogorō) of the Chōshū Domain (Chōshū-&quot;han&quot;).

All three were &quot;samurai&quot; of the Satchō Alliance, and died within a short period of time between 1877 (Meiji 10) and 1878 (Meiji 11). Saigō led the Satsuma Rebellion, the largest uprising against the new Meiji government, and died at the Battle of Shiroyama. Kido died from an unknown illness during the Satsuma Rebellion, and Ōkubo was later assassinated by former &quot;samurai&quot; of the Kaga Domain (modern day Ishikawa Prefecture) for his involvement against the uprising.

<text>Judas Maccabaeus or Maccabeus ( ), also known as Judah Maccabee (), was a Jewish priest (&quot;kohen&quot;) and a son of the priest Mattathias. He led the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire (167–160 BCE).

The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah (&quot;Dedication&quot;) commemorates the restoration of Jewish worship at the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 164 BCE after Judah Maccabee removed all of the statues depicting Greek gods and goddesses and purified it.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Judah was the third son of Mattathias, the Hasmonean, a Jewish priest from the village of Modi&#x27;in. In 167 BCE, Mattathias, together with his sons Judah, Eleazar, Simon, John, and Jonathan, started a revolt against the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who since 169/8 BCE had issued decrees that forbade Jewish religious practices. After Mattathias died in 166 BCE, Judah assumed leadership of the revolt per the deathbed disposition of his father. The First Book of Maccabees praises Judah&#x27;s valor and military talent, suggesting that those qualities made Judah a natural choice for the new commander.

=== Origin of the name &quot;The Hammer&quot; ===
In the early days of the rebellion, Judah received the surname Maccabee. It is not known whether this name should be understood in Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic. Several explanations have been put forward for this name. One suggestion is that the name derives from the Aramaic &quot;maqqaba&quot; (&quot;makebet&quot; in modern Hebrew), &quot;hammer&quot; or &quot;sledgehammer&quot; (cf. the cognomen of Charles Martel, the 8th century Frankish leader), in recognition of his ferocity in battle.

According to Jewish folklore, the name &quot;Maccabee&quot; is an acronym of the verse &quot;Mi kamokha ba&#x27;elim Adonai (YHWH)&quot;, &quot;Who is like you, O God, among the gods that are worshiped?&quot;, the Maccabean battle-cry to motivate troops (Exodus 15:11) as well as a part of daily Jewish prayers (see Mi Chamocha). Some scholars maintain that the name is a shortened form of the Hebrew &quot;maqqab-Yahu&quot; (from &quot;naqab&quot;, &quot;to mark, to designate&quot;), meaning &quot;the one designated by God.&quot; Although contextualized as a modern-day &quot;surname&quot; (Jews didn&#x27;t start having surnames until the Middle Ages) exclusive to Judah, Maccabee came to signify all the Hasmoneans who fought during the Maccabean revolt.

=== Early victories ===

Mindful of the superiority of Seleucid forces during the first two years of the revolt, Judah&#x27;s strategy was to avoid any engagement with their regular army and resort to guerrilla warfare to give them a feeling of insecurity. The strategy enabled Judah to win a string of victories. At the battle of Nahal el-Haramiah (wadi haramia), he defeated a small Seleucid force under the command of Apollonius, governor of Samaria, who was killed. Judah took possession of Apollonius&#x27;s sword and used it until his death as a symbol of vengeance. After Nahal el-Haramiah, recruits flocked to the Jewish cause.

Shortly after that, Judah routed a larger Seleucid army under the command of Seron near Beth-Horon, largely thanks to a good choice of battlefield. Then, in the Battle of Emmaus, Judah proceeded to defeat the Seleucid forces led by generals Nicanor and Gorgias. This force was dispatched by Lysias, whom Antiochus left as viceroy after departing on a campaign against the Parthians. By a forced night march, Judah succeeded in eluding Gorgias, who had intended to attack and destroy the Jewish forces in their camp with his cavalry. While Gorgias was searching for him in the mountains, Judah surprisedly attacked the Seleucid camp and defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Emmaus. The Seleucid commander had no alternative but to withdraw to the coast.

The defeat at Emmaus convinced Lysias that he must prepare for a serious and prolonged war. He accordingly assembled a new and larger army and marched with it on Judea from the south via Idumea. After several years of conflict, Judah drove out his foes from Jerusalem, except for the garrison in the citadel of Acra. He purified the defiled Temple of Jerusalem and, on the 25th of Kislev (December 14, 164 BCE), restored the service in the Temple. The reconsecration of the Temple became a permanent Jewish holiday, Hanukkah, which continued even after the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE. Hanukkah is still celebrated annually. The liberation of Jerusalem was the first step on the road to ultimate independence.

=== After Jerusalem ===

Upon hearing the news that the Jewish communities in Gilead, Transjordan, and Galilee were under attack by neighboring Greek cities, Judah immediately went to their aid. Judah sent his brother, Simeon, to Galilee at the head of 3,000 men; Simeon was successful, achieving numerous victories. He transplanted a substantial portion of the Jewish settlements, including women and children, to Judea. Judah led the campaign in Transjordan, taking his brother Jonathan with him. After fierce fighting, he defeated the Transjordanian tribes and rescued the Jews concentrated in fortified towns in Gilead. The Jewish population of the areas taken by the Maccabees was evacuated to Judea. After the fighting in Transjordan, Judah turned against the Edomites in the south, captured and destroyed Hebron and Maresha. He then marched on the coast of the Mediterranean, destroyed the altars and statues of the pagan gods in Ashdod, and returned to Judea with many spoils.

Judah then laid siege to the Seleucid garrison at the Acra, the Seleucid citadel of Jerusalem. The besieged, who included not only Syrian-Greek troops but also Hellenistic Jews, appealed for help to Lysias, who effectively became the regent of the young king Antiochus V Eupator after the death of Antiochus Epiphanes at the end of 164 BCE during the Parthian campaign. Lysias and Eupator set out for a new campaign in Judea. Lysias skirted Judea as he had done in his first campaign, entering it from the south and besieging Beth-Zur. Judah raised the siege of the Acra and went to meet Lysias. In the Battle of Beth-zechariah, south of Bethlehem, the Seleucids achieved their first major victory over the Maccabees, and Judah was forced to withdraw to Jerusalem. Beth-Zur was compelled to surrender, and Lysias reached Jerusalem and laid siege on the city. The defenders found themselves in a precarious situation because their provisions were exhausted; it was a sabbatical year during which the fields were left uncultivated. However, just as capitulation seemed imminent, Lysias and Eupator had to withdraw when Antiochus Epiphanes&#x27;s commander-in-chief Philip, whom the late ruler appointed regent before his death, rebelled against Lysias and was about to enter Antioch and seize power. Lysias proposed a peaceful settlement, which was concluded at the end of 163 BCE. The peace terms were based on the restoration of religious freedom, the permission for the Jews to live per their own laws, and the official return of the Temple to the Jews. Lysias defeated Philip, only to be overthrown by Demetrius, son of the late Seleucus IV Philopator, who returned from years as a hostage in Rome. Demetrius appointed Alcimus (Jakim), a Hellenistic Jew, as high priest, a choice the Hasidim (Pietists) might have accepted since he was of priestly descent.

=== Internal conflict ===

When war against the external enemy ended, an internal struggle broke out between the party led by Judah and the Hellenist party. The influence of the Hellenizers all but collapsed in the wake of the Seleucid defeat. The Hellenizing High Priest Menelaus was removed from office and executed. His successor was another Hellenizer Alcimus. When Alcimus executed sixty priests who were opposed to him, he found himself in open conflict with the Maccabees. Alcimus fled from Jerusalem and went to the Seleucid king, asking for help.

Meanwhile, Demetrius I Soter, son of Seleucus IV Philopator and nephew of the late Antiochus IV Epiphanes, fled from Rome in defiance of the Roman Senate and arrived in Syria. Declaring himself the rightful king, he captured and killed Lysias and Antiochus Eupator, taking the throne. It was thus Demetrius to whom the delegation, led by Alcimus, complained of the persecution of the Hellenist party in Judea. Demetrius granted Alcimus&#x27;s request to be appointed High Priest under the protection of the king&#x27;s army and sent to Judea an army led by Bacchides. The weaker Jewish army could not oppose the enemy and withdrew from Jerusalem, so Judah returned to wage guerrilla warfare. Soon after, the Seleucid Army needed to return to Antioch because of the turbulent political situation. Judah&#x27;s forces returned to Jerusalem, and the Seleucids dispatched another army led by Nicanor. In a battle near Adasa, on the 13th Adar 161 BCE, the Seleucid army was destroyed, and Nicanor was killed. The annual &quot;Day of Nicanor&quot; was instituted to commemorate this victory.

=== Agreement with Rome and death ===

The Roman–Jewish Treaty was an agreement made between Judah Maccabee and the Roman Republic in 161 BCE according to and Josephus. It was the first recorded contract between the Jewish people and the Romans.

The agreement with Rome failed to affect Demetrius&#x27; policy. On receiving the news of Nicanor&#x27;s defeat, he dispatched a new army, again commanded by Bacchides. This time, the Seleucid forces of 20,000 men were numerically so superior that most of Judah&#x27;s men left the battlefield and advised their leader to do likewise and await a more favorable opportunity. However, Judah decided to stand his ground.

In the Battle of Elasa, Judah and those who remained faithful to him were killed. His body was taken by his brothers from the battlefield and buried in the family sepulcher at Modiin. The death of Judah Maccabee (d. 160 BCE) stirred the Jews to renewed resistance. After several additional years of war under the leadership of two of Mattathias&#x27; other sons (Jonathan and Simon), the Jews finally achieved independence and the liberty to worship freely.

== In the arts ==

=== Pre-19th century ===
As a warrior hero and national liberator, Judah Maccabee has inspired many writers, and several artists and composers. In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante sees his spirit in the Heaven of Mars with the other &quot;heroes of the true faith&quot;. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, he is enacted along with the other Nine Worthies, but heckled for sharing a name with Judas Iscariot. Most significant works dedicated solely to him date from the 17th century onwards. William Houghton&#x27;s &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot;, performed in about 1601 but now lost, is thought to have been the first drama on the theme; however, &quot;Judas Macabeo&quot;, an early &quot;comedia&quot; by crucial Spanish playwright Pedro Calderón de la Barca, is extant. Fernando Rodríguez-Gallego details its history in his critical edition: the play was performed in the 1620s in different versions and finally published as part of an anthology by Vera Tassis in 1637. Following on its heels is &quot;El Macabeo&quot; (Naples, 1638), a Castilian epic by the Portuguese Marrano Miguel de Silveyra. Two other 17th-century works are &quot;La chevalerie de Judas Macabé&quot;, by French poet Pierre Du Ries, and the anonymous Neo-Latin work &quot;Judas Machabaeus&quot; (Rome, 1695). Handel wrote his &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot; oratorio (1746) on the subject.

=== 19th century ===

There has been interest in Judah in every century. &quot;Giuda Macabeo, ossia la morte di Nicanore...&quot; (1839) is an Italian &quot;azione sacra&quot; based on which Vallicella composed an oratorio. One of the best-known literary works on the theme is &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot; (1872), a five-act verse tragedy by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. A Hebrew version of Longfellow&#x27;s play was published in 1900. Two later 19th-century interpretations of the story are &quot;Judas Makkabaeus&quot;, a novella by the German writer Josef Eduard Konrad Bischoff, which appeared in &quot;Der Gefangene von Kuestrin&quot; (1885), and &quot;The Hammer&quot; (1890), a book by Alfred J. Church and Richmond Seeley.

=== 20th century ===
Several 20th-century Jewish authors have also written works devoted to Judah Maccabee and the Maccabean Revolt. Jacob Benjamin Katznelson (1855–1930) wrote the poem, &quot;Alilot Gibbor ha-Yehudim Yehudah ha-Makkabi le-Veit ha-Hashmona&#x27;im&quot; (1922); the Yiddish writer Moses Schulstein wrote the dramatic poem, &quot;Yehudah ha-Makkabi&quot; (in &quot;A Layter tsu der Zun&quot;, 1954); Jacob Fichman&#x27;s &quot;Yehudah ha-Makkabi&quot; is one of the heroic tales included in &quot;Sippurim le-Mofet&quot; (1954). Amit Arad&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Lions of Judea – The miraculous story of the Maccabees&quot; (2014). Many children&#x27;s plays have also been written on the theme by various Jewish authors.

In addition, the American writer Howard Fast penned the historical novel, &quot;My Glorious Brothers&quot;, which was published in 1948, during the 1947–1949 Palestine war.

During World War II the Swiss-German writer Karl Boxler published his novel &quot;Judas Makkabaeus; ein Kleinvolk kaempft um Glaube und Heimat&quot; (1943), the subtitle of which suggests that Swiss democrats then drew a parallel between their own national hero, William Tell, and the leader of the Maccabean revolt against foreign tyranny.

The modern play &quot;Playing Dreidel with Judah Maccabee&quot; by Edward Einhorn is about a contemporary boy who meets the historical figure.

=== Visual arts ===
In the medieval Christian art, Judah Maccabee was regarded as one of the heroes of the Old Testament. He figures in a tenth-century illustrated manuscript &quot;Libri Maccabaeorum&quot;. The late medieval French artist Jean Fouquet painted an illustration of Judah triumphing over his enemies for his famous manuscript of Josephus. Rubens painted Judah Maccabee praying for the dead; the painting illustrates an episode from 2 Maccabees 12:39–48 in which Judah&#x27;s troops find stolen idolatrous charms on the corpses of Jewish warriors slain on the battlefield. He therefore offers prayers and an expiatory sacrifice for these warriors who have died in a state of sin. During the Counter-Reformation the passage was used by Catholics against Protestants in order to justify the doctrine of purgatory. Accordingly, Rubens painted the scene for the Chapel of the Dead in Tournai cathedral. In the 19th century, Paul Gustave Doré executed an engraving of Judah Maccabee victoriously pursuing the shattered troops of the Syrian enemy.

=== Music ===
In music, almost all the compositions inspired by the Hasmonean rebellion revolve around Judah. In 1746, the composer George Frideric Handel composed his oratorio &quot;Judas Maccabeus,&quot; putting the biblical story in the context of the Jacobite rising of 1745. This work, with libretto by Thomas Morell, had been written for the celebrations following the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s victory over the Scottish Jacobite rebels at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The oratorio&#x27;s most famous chorus is &quot;See, the conqu&#x27;ring hero comes&quot;. The tune of this chorus was later adopted as a Christian Easter hymn tune &quot;Thine Be The Glory, Risen Conquering Son&quot;. A Hebrew translation of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Judas Maccabee&quot; was prepared for the 1932 Maccabiah Games and is now popular in Israel with the motif of &quot;conqu&#x27;ring hero&quot; becoming a Hanukkah song. Beethoven composed a set of theme and variations 12 Variations on &quot;&#x27;See the conqu&#x27;ring hero comes&quot;&#x27; for Cello and Piano, WoO 45.

Tom Lehrer refers to Judas Maccabeus in his song &quot;Hanukkah in Santa Monica&quot;.

Mirah refers to Judah Maccabee in her song &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

In &quot;The Goldbergs Mixtape&quot;, a parody song is named &quot;Judah Macabee&quot;.

<text>Chashitsu (, &quot;tea room&quot;) in Japanese tradition is an architectural space designed to be used for tea ceremony (&quot;chanoyu&quot;) gatherings.

The architectural style that developed for &quot;chashitsu&quot; is referred to as the &quot;sukiya&quot; style (&quot;sukiya-zukuri&quot;), and the term &quot;sukiya&quot; () may be used as a synonym for &quot;chashitsu&quot;. Related Japanese terms are &quot;chaseki&quot; (), broadly meaning &quot;place for tea&quot;, and implying any sort of space where people are seated to participate in tea ceremony, and &quot;chabana&quot;, &quot;tea flowers&quot;, the style of flower arrangement associated with the tea ceremony.

Typical features of &quot;chashitsu&quot; are &quot;shōji&quot; windows and sliding doors made of wooden lattice covered in a translucent Japanese paper; &quot;tatami&quot; mat floors; a &quot;tokonoma&quot; alcove; and simple, subdued colours and style. The most typical floor size of a &quot;chashitsu&quot; is 4.5 tatami mats ().

== Definition ==

In Japanese, free-standing structures specifically designed for exclusive tea ceremony use, as well as individual rooms intended for tea ceremony, are both referred to as &quot;chashitsu&quot;. The term may be used to indicate the tea room itself where the guests are received, or that room and its attached facilities, even extending to the roji garden path leading to it. In English, a distinction is often made between free-standing structures for tea, referred to as &quot;tea houses&quot;, and rooms used for tea ceremony incorporated within other structures.

&quot;Tea houses&quot; are usually small, simple wooden buildings. They are located in the gardens or grounds of private homes. Other common sites are the grounds of temples, museums, and parks. The smallest tea house will have two rooms: the main room where the host and guests gather and tea is served, and a &quot;mizuya&quot;, where the host prepares the sweets and equipment. The entire structure may have a total floor area of only three tatami mats.

Very large tea houses may have several tea rooms of different sizes; a large, well-equipped &quot;mizuya&quot; resembling a modern kitchen; a large waiting room for guests; a welcoming area where guests are greeted and can remove and store their shoes; separate toilets for men and women; a changing room; a storage room; and possibly several anterooms as well as a garden with a &quot;roji&quot; path, an outdoor waiting area for guests and one or more privies.

&quot;Tea rooms&quot; are purpose-built spaces for holding tea gatherings. They may be located within larger tea houses, or within private homes or other structures not intended for tea ceremony. A tea room may have a floor area as small as 1.75 tatami mats (one full tatami mat for the guests plus a tatami mat called a &quot;daime&quot; (), about 3/4 the length of a full tatami mat, for the portable brazier (&quot;furo&quot;) or sunken hearth (&quot;ro&quot;) to be situated and the host to sit and prepare the tea); or as large as 10 tatami mats or more; 4.5 mats is generally considered the ideal in modern tea rooms. A tea room will usually contain a &quot;tokonoma&quot; and a sunken hearth for preparing tea in the winter.

== History ==
The term &quot;chashitsu&quot; came into use after the start of the Edo period (). In earlier times, various terms were used for spaces used for tea ceremony, such as &quot;chanoyu zashiki&quot; (, &quot;sitting room for &quot;chanoyu&quot;&quot;), &quot;sukiya&quot; (place for poetically inclined aesthetic pursuits [&quot;fūryū&quot;, ]) such as &quot;chanoyu&quot;), and &quot;kakoi&quot; (, &quot;partitioned-off space&quot;). An account stated that it was the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa who built the first &quot;chashitsu&quot; at his Higashiyama villa in Kyoto. It was described as a small room of four-and-a-half &quot;tatami&quot; and was separated from the main residence.

According to Japanese historian Moriya Takeshi in his article &quot;The Mountain Dwelling Within the City&quot;, the ideal of &quot;wabi&quot;-style tea ceremony (&quot;wabi-cha&quot;) had its roots in the urban society of the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573), and took form in the tea houses that townspeople built at their residences and which affected the appearance of thatched huts in mountain villages. Before this, tea ceremony was generally enjoyed in rooms built in the &quot;shoin-zukuri&quot; architectural style, a style frequently employed in tea rooms built today.

Tea houses first appeared in the Sengoku period (mid-15th century to early 17th century), a time in which the central government had almost no practical power, the country was in chaos, and wars and uprisings were commonplace. Seeking to reclaim Japan, samurai were busy acquiring and defending territories, promoting trade and overseeing the output of farms, mills and mines as de facto rulers, and many of the poor were eager to seek the salvation of the afterlife as taught by Buddhism. Tea houses were built mostly by Zen monks or by &quot;daimyōs&quot;, samurai, and merchants who practiced tea ceremony. They sought simplicity and tranquility – central tenets of Zen philosophy. The acknowledgment of simplicity and plainness, which is a central motivation of the tea house, continued to remain as a distinct Japanese tradition in the later periods.

The was a portable gilded &quot;chashitsu&quot; constructed during the 16th century Azuchi–Momoyama period for the Japanese regent Lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s tea ceremonies. The original room is lost, but a number of reconstructions have been made. The Golden Tea Room was constructed to impress guests with the might and power of the regent. This was in contrast to the rustic aesthetics codified under his tea master Sen no Rikyū, although it is speculated that Rikyū might have helped in the design. The room&#x27;s opulence was highly unusual and may have also been against &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; norms. At the same time, the simplicity of the overall design with its clean lines could be seen as within the canon. The extent of teamaster Rikyū&#x27;s involvement in the design of the room is not known, however he was in attendance on a number of occasions when tea was being served to guests in the room.

== Architecture ==
The ideal free-standing tea house is surrounded by a small garden having a path leading to the tea room. This garden is called &quot;roji&quot; (, &quot;dewy ground&quot;) and is divided into two parts by a gate called &quot;chumon&quot;. Along the path is a waiting bench for guests and a privy. Aside from its own garden, the &quot;chashitsu&quot; is arranged – along with other pavilions such as the &quot;zashiki&quot;, &quot;oku no zashiki&quot;, and &quot;hanare zashiki&quot; – around a larger primary garden.

There is a stone water-basin near the tea house, where the guests rinse their hands and mouths before entering the tea room through a low, square door called &quot;nijiriguchi&quot;, or &quot;crawling-in entrance&quot;, which requires bending low to pass through and symbolically separates the small, simple, quiet inside from the crowded, overwhelming outside world. The &quot;nijiriguchi&quot; leads directly into the tea room.

The tea room has a low ceiling and no furniture: the guests and host sit &quot;seiza&quot;-style on the floor. All materials used are intentionally simple and rustic. Besides the guests&#x27; entrance, there may be several more entrances; at minimum there is an entrance for the host known as the &quot;sadōguchi&quot;, which allows access to the &quot;mizuya&quot;. Windows are generally small and covered with shōji, which allows natural light to filter in. The windows are not intended to provide a view to the outside, which would detract from the participants&#x27; concentration. There is a sunken hearth ( &quot;ro&quot;) located in the tatami adjacent to the host&#x27;s tatami, for use in the cold months; this hearth is covered with a plain tatami and is not visible in the warm months, when a portable brazier ( &quot;furo&quot;) is used instead.

There will be a &quot;tokonoma&quot; (scroll alcove) holding a scroll of calligraphy or brush painting, and perhaps a small, simple, flower arrangement called a &quot;chabana&quot; (), but no other decoration.


&quot;Chashitsu&quot; are broadly classified according to whether they have a floor area larger or smaller than 4.5 tatami, a differentiation which affects the style of ceremony that can be conducted, the specific type of equipment and decoration that can be used, the placement of various architectural features and the hearth, and the number of guests that can be accommodated. &quot;Chashitsu&quot; which are larger than 4.5 mats are called &quot;hiroma&quot; (&quot;big room&quot;), while those that are smaller are called &quot;koma&quot; (&quot;small room&quot;). &quot;Hiroma&quot; often are shoin style rooms, and for the most part are not limited to use for &quot;chanoyu.&quot;

Other factors that affect the tea room are architectural constraints such as the location of windows, entrances, the sunken hearth and the tokonoma, particularly when the tea room is not located within a purpose-built structure. The other factors that influence the construction of the &quot;chashitsu&quot; as a space in the &quot;iemoto&quot; are the iconography of the past and the memory of particular individuals.

Not all tea rooms can be made to conform to the ideal seen in the image.

== Typical names ==

It is usual for &quot;chashitsu&quot; to be given a name after their owners or benefactors. Names usually include the character for &quot;hut&quot;, &quot;hall&quot;, or &quot;arbour&quot;, and reflect the spirit of rustic simplicity of the tea ceremony and the teachings of Zen Buddhism. Characteristic names include:

* Mugai-an (, Introvert Hut)
* Mokurai-an (, Silent Thunder Hut)

<text>A non-directional beacon (NDB) or non-directional radio beacon is a radio beacon which does not include directional information. Radio beacons are radio transmitters at a known location, used as an aviation or marine navigational aid. NDB are in contrast to directional radio beacons and other navigational aids, such as low-frequency radio range, VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and tactical air navigation system (TACAN). 

NDB signals follow the curvature of the Earth, so they can be received at much greater distances at lower altitudes, a major advantage over VOR. However, NDB signals are also affected more by atmospheric conditions, mountainous terrain, coastal refraction and electrical storms, particularly at long range. The system, developed by United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) Captain Albert Francis Hegenberger, was used to fly the world&#x27;s first instrument approach on May 9, 1932.

==Types of NDBs==
NDBs used for aviation are standardised by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 10 which specifies that NDBs be operated on a frequency between 190 kHz and 1750 kHz, although normally all NDBs in North America operate between 190 kHz and 535 kHz. Each NDB is identified by a one, two, or three-letter Morse code callsign. In Canada, privately owned NDB identifiers consist of one letter and one number.

Non-directional beacons in North America are classified by power output: &quot;low&quot; power rating is less than 50 watts; &quot;medium&quot; from 50 W to 2,000 W; and &quot;high&quot; at more than 2,000 W.

There are four types of non-directional beacons in the aeronautical navigation service:

* En route NDBs, used to mark airways
* Approach NDBs
* Localizer beacons
* Locator beacons

The last two types are used in conjunction with an instrument landing system (ILS).

==Automatic direction finder equipment==

NDB navigation consists of two parts — the &quot;automatic direction finder&quot; (ADF) equipment on the aircraft that detects an NDB&#x27;s signal, and the NDB transmitter. The ADF can also locate transmitters in the standard AM medium wave broadcast band (530 kHz to 1700 kHz at 10 kHz increments in the Americas, 531 kHz to 1602 kHz at 9 kHz increments in the rest of the world).

ADF equipment determines the direction or bearing to the NDB station relative to the aircraft by using a combination of directional and non-directional antennae to sense the direction in which the combined signal is strongest. This bearing may be displayed on a relative bearing indicator (RBI). This display looks like a compass card with a needle superimposed, except that the card is fixed with the 0 degree position corresponding to the centreline of the aircraft. In order to track toward an NDB (with no wind), the aircraft is flown so that the needle points to the 0 degree position. The aircraft will then fly directly to the NDB. Similarly, the aircraft will track directly away from the NDB if the needle is maintained on the 180 degree mark. With a crosswind, the needle must be maintained to the left or right of the 0 or 180 position by an amount corresponding to the drift due to the crosswind.

The formula to determine the compass heading to an NDB station (in a no wind situation) is to take the relative bearing between the aircraft and the station, and add the magnetic heading of the aircraft; if the total is greater than 360 degrees, then 360 must be subtracted. This gives the magnetic bearing that must be flown: (RB + MH) mod 360 = MB.

When tracking to or from an NDB, it is also usual that the aircraft track on a specific bearing. To do this it is necessary to correlate the RBI reading with the compass heading. Having determined the drift, the aircraft must be flown so that the compass heading is the required bearing adjusted for drift at the same time as the RBI reading is 0 or 180 adjusted for drift. An NDB may also be used to locate a position along the aircraft&#x27;s current track (such as a radial path from a second NDB or a VOR). When the needle reaches an RBI reading corresponding to the required bearing, then the aircraft is at the position. However, using a separate RBI and compass, this requires considerable mental calculation to determine the appropriate relative bearing.

To simplify this task, a compass card driven by the aircraft&#x27;s magnetic compass is added to the RBI to form a radio magnetic indicator (RMI). The ADF needle is then referenced immediately to the aircraft&#x27;s magnetic heading, which reduces the necessity for mental calculation. Many RMIs used for aviation also allow the device to display information from a second radio tuned to a VOR station; the aircraft can then fly directly between VOR stations (so-called &quot;Victor&quot; routes) while using the NDBs to triangulate their position along the radial, without the need for the VOR station to have a collocated distance measuring equipment (DME). This display, along with the omni bearing indicator (OBI) for VOR/ILS information, was one of the primary radio navigation instruments prior to the introduction of the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) and subsequent digital displays used in glass cockpits.

The principles of ADFs are not limited to NDB usage; such systems are also used to detect the locations of broadcast signals for many other purposes, such as finding emergency beacons.

==Uses==

===Airways===
A bearing is a line passing through the station that points in a specific direction, such as 270 degrees (due west). NDB bearings provide a charted, consistent method for defining paths aircraft can fly. In this fashion, NDBs can, like VORs, define airways in the sky. Aircraft follow these pre-defined routes to complete a flight plan. Airways are numbered and standardized on charts. Colored airways are used for low to medium frequency stations like the NDB and are charted in brown on sectional charts. Green and red airways are plotted east and west, while amber and blue airways are plotted north and south. As of September 2022, only one colored airway is left in the continental United States, located off the coast of North Carolina and is called G13 or Green 13. Alaska is the only other state in the United States to make use of the colored airway systems. Pilots follow these routes by tracking bearings across various navigation stations, and turning at some. While most airways in the United States are based on VORs, NDB airways are common elsewhere, especially in the developing world and in lightly populated areas of developed countries, like the Canadian Arctic, since they can have a long range and are much less expensive to operate than VORs.

All standard airways are plotted on aeronautical charts, such as the United States sectional charts, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

===Fixes===
NDBs have long been used by aircraft navigators, and previously mariners, to help obtain a fix of their geographic location on the surface of the Earth. Fixes are computed by extending lines through known navigational reference points until they intersect. For visual reference points, the angles of these lines can be determined by compass; the bearings of NDB radio signals are found using radio direction finder (RDF) equipment. 

Plotting fixes in this manner allow crews to determine their position. This usage is important in situations where other navigational equipment, such as VORs with distance measuring equipment (DME), have failed. In marine navigation, NDBs may still be useful should Global Positioning System (GPS) reception fail.

===Determining distance from an NDB station===

To determine the distance to an NDB station, the pilot uses this method:
#Turns the aircraft so that the station is directly off one of the wingtips.
#Flies that heading, timing how long it takes to cross a specific number of NDB bearings.
#Uses the formula: Time to station = 60 × number of minutes flown / degrees of bearing change
#Computes the distance the aircraft is from the station; time × speed = distance

===NDB approaches===
A runway equipped with NDB or VOR (or both) as the only navigation aid is called a non-precision approach runway; if it is equipped with ILS, it is called a precision approach runway.

===Instrument landing systems===
NDBs are most commonly used as markers or &quot;locators&quot; for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach or standard approach. NDBs may designate the starting area for an ILS approach or a path to follow for a standard terminal arrival route, or STAR. In the United States, an NDB is often combined with the outer marker beacon in the ILS approach (called a locator outer marker, or LOM); in Canada, low-powered NDBs have replaced marker beacons entirely. Marker beacons on ILS approaches are now being phased out worldwide with DME ranges or GPS signals used, instead, to delineate the different segments of the approach.

===Naval operational uses===
German Navy U-boats during World War II were equipped with a Telefunken Spez 2113S homing beacon. This transmitter could operate on 100 kHz to 1500 kHz with a power of 150 W. It was used to send the submarine&#x27;s location to other submarines or aircraft, which were equipped with DF receivers and loop antennas.

==Antenna and signal characteristics==

NDBs typically operate in the frequency range from 190 kHz to 535 kHz (although they are allocated frequencies from 190 to 1750 kHz) and transmit a carrier modulated by either 400 or 1020 Hz. NDBs can also be collocated with a DME in a similar installation for the ILS as the outer marker, only in this case, they function as the inner marker. NDB owners are mostly governmental agencies and airport authorities.

NDB radiators are vertically polarised. NDB antennas are usually too short for resonance at the frequency they operate – typically perhaps 20 metres length compared to a wavelength around 1000 m. Therefore, they require a suitable matching network that may consist of an inductor and a capacitor to &quot;tune&quot; the antenna. Vertical NDB antennas may also have a T-antenna, nicknamed a &quot;top hat&quot;, which is an umbrella-like structure designed to add loading at the end and improve its radiating efficiency. Usually a ground plane or counterpoise is connected underneath the antenna.

===Other information transmitted by an NDB===
Apart from Morse code identity of either 400 Hz or 1020 Hz, the NDB may broadcast:

*Automatic terminal information service (ATIS)
*Automatic weather information service (AWIS), or, in an emergency i.e. air-to-ground communication failure, an air traffic controller using a push-to-talk (PTT) function, may modulate the carrier with voice. The pilot uses their ADF receiver to hear instructions from the control tower.
*Automated weather observing system (AWOS)
*Automated surface observing system (ASOS)
*VOLMET (meteorological information for aircraft in flight) or meteorological information broadcast
*Transcribed weather broadcast (TWEB)
*PIP monitoring. If an NDB has a problem, e.g. lower than normal power output, failure of mains power or standby transmitter is in operation, the NDB may be programmed to transmit an extra &#x27;PIP&#x27; (a Morse dot), to alert pilots and others that the beacon may be unreliable for navigation.

== Common adverse effects ==
Navigation using an ADF to track NDBs is subject to several common effects:

;Night effect
:Radio waves reflected back by the ionosphere can cause signal strength fluctuations from the transmitter, especially just before sunrise and just after sunset. This is more common on frequencies above 350 kHz. Because the returning sky waves travel over a different path, they have a different phase from the ground wave. This has the effect of suppressing the aerial signal in a fairly random manner. The needle on the indicator will start wandering. The indication will be most erratic during twilight at dusk and dawn.
;Terrain effect
:High terrain like mountains and cliffs can reflect radio waves, giving erroneous readings. Magnetic deposits can also cause erroneous readings
;Thunderstorm effect
: Water droplets and ice crystals circulating within a storm cloud, generate wideband noise. This high power noise may affect the accuracy of the ADF bearing. Lightning, due to the high power output will cause the needle of the RMI/RBI to point for a moment to the bearing of the lightning.
;Shoreline effect
:Radio waves speed up over water, causing the wave front to bend away from its normal path and pull it towards the coast. Refraction is negligible perpendicular (90°) to the coast, but increases as the angle of incidence decreases. The effect can be minimised by flying higher or by using NDBs situated nearer the coast.
;Station interference
:Due to congestion of stations in the LF and MF bands, there is the possibility of interference from stations on or near the same frequency. This will cause bearing errors. By day, the use of an NDB within the DOC will normally afford protection from interference. However, at night one can expect interference even within the DOC because of skywave contamination from stations out of range by day. Therefore, positive identification of the NDB at night should always be carried out.
;Dip (bank) angle
:During banking turns in an aircraft, the horizontal part of the loop aerial will no longer be horizontal and detect a signal. This causes displacement of the null in a way similar to the night effect giving an erroneous reading on the indicator which means that the pilot should not obtain a bearing unless the aircraft is wings-level.

While pilots study these effects during initial training, trying to compensate for them in flight is very difficult; instead, pilots generally simply choose a heading that seems to average out any fluctuations.

Radio-navigation aids must keep a certain degree of accuracy, given by international standards, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), ICAO, etc.; to assure this is the case, Flight inspection organizations periodically check critical parameters with properly equipped aircraft to calibrate and certify NDB precision. The ICAO minimum accuracy for NDBs is ±5°

==Monitoring NDBs==

Besides their use in aircraft navigation, NDBs are also popular with long-distance radio enthusiasts (&quot;DXers&quot;). Because NDBs are generally low-power (usually 25 watts, some can be up to 5 kW), they normally cannot be heard over long distances, but favorable conditions in the ionosphere can allow NDB signals to travel much farther than normal. Because of this, radio DXers interested in picking up distant signals enjoy listening to faraway NDBs. Also, since the band allocated to NDBs is free of broadcast stations and their associated interference, and because most NDBs do little more than transmit their Morse code callsign, they are very easy to identify, making NDB monitoring an active niche within the DXing hobby.

In North America, the NDB band is from 190 to 435 kHz and from 510 to 530 kHz. In Europe, there is a longwave broadcasting band from 150 to 280 kHz, so the European NDB band is from 280 kHz to 530 kHz with a gap between 495 and 505 kHz because 500 kHz was the international maritime distress (emergency) frequency.

The beacons that transmit between 510 kHz and 530 kHz can sometimes be heard on AM radios that can tune below the beginning of the medium wave (MW) broadcast band. However, reception of NDBs generally requires a radio receiver that can receive frequencies below 530 kHz. Often &quot;general coverage&quot; shortwave radios receive all frequencies from 150 kHz to 30 MHz, and so can tune to the frequencies of NDBs. Specialized techniques (receiver preselectors, noise limiters and filters) are required for the reception of very weak signals from remote beacons.

The best time to hear NDBs that are very far away is the last three hours before sunrise. Reception of NDBs is also usually best during the fall and winter because during the spring and summer, there is more atmospheric noise on the LF and MF bands.

==Beacon closures==
As the adoption of satellite navigation systems such as GPS progressed, several countries began to decommission beacon installations such as NDBs and VOR. The policy has caused controversy in the aviation industry.

Airservices Australia began shutting down a number of ground-based navigation aids in May 2016, including NDBs, VORs and DMEs.

In the United States as of 2017, there were more than 1,300 NDBs, of which fewer than 300 were owned by the Federal Government. The FAA had begun decommissioning stand-alone NDBs. As of April 2018, the FAA had disabled 23 ground-based navaids including NDBs, and plans to shut down more than 300 by 2025. The FAA has no sustaining or acquisition system for NDBs and plans to phase out the existing NDBs through attrition, citing decreased pilot reliance on NDBs as more pilots use VOR and GPS navigation.

<doc id="316406" wikidata="Q385551" url="?curid=316406" title="Ōmura Masujirō">
<text>(May 30, 1824 – December 7, 1869) was a Japanese military leader and theorist in Bakumatsu period Japan. He was the &quot;Father&quot; of the Imperial Japanese Army, launching a modern military force closely patterned after the French system of the day.

==Early life and education==
Ōmura was born in what is now part of Yamaguchi city, in the former Chōshū Domain, where his father was a rural physician. From a young age, Ōmura had a strong interest in learning and medicine, travelling to Osaka to study &quot;rangaku&quot; under the direction of Ogata Kōan at his &quot;Tekijuku&quot; academy of western studies when he was twenty-two. He continued his education in Nagasaki under the direction of German physician Philipp Franz von Siebold, the first European to teach Western medicine in Japan. His interest in Western military tactics was sparked in the 1850s and it was this interest that led Ōmura to become a valuable asset after the Meiji Restoration in the creation of Japan&#x27;s modern army.

==Early career==
After studying in Nagasaki, Ōmura returned to his village at the age of twenty-six to practice medicine but accepted an offer from &quot;daimyō&quot; Date Munenari of nearby Uwajima Domain in 1853 to serve as an expert in Western studies and a military school instructor in exchange for the &quot;samurai&quot; rank that he was not born into. As foreign incursions into Japanese territorial waters increased, and as pressure from foreign powers for Japan to end its national seclusion policy, Ōmura was sent back to Nagasaki to study the construction of warships and navigation. He traveled to Edo in 1856 in the retinue of Date Munenari and was appointed a teacher at the shogunate&#x27;s &quot;Bansho Shirabesho&quot; institute for Western studies. During this time, he also continued his education by learning English under the Yokohama-based American missionary James Curtis Hepburn.

In 1861, Chōshū domain hired Ōmura back to teach at the Chōshū military academy and to reform and modernize the domainal army; they too gave him the ranking of &quot;samurai&quot;. It was this same year that Ōmura began his involvement with Kido Takayoshi, a political moderate who served as a liaison between the domain bureaucracy and radical elements among the young, lower-echelon Chōshū &quot;samurai&quot; who supported the &quot;Sonnō jōi&quot; movement and the violent overthrow of Tokugawa rule.

==As a Military Leader==
After his return to Chōshū, Ōmura not only introduced modern western weaponry, but he also introduced the concept of military training for both &quot;samurai&quot; and commoners. The concept was highly controversial, but Ōmura was vindicated when his troops routed the all-samurai army of the Shogunate in the Second Chōshū Expedition of 1866. These same troops also formed the core of the armies of the Satchō Alliance at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi, Battle of Ueno and other battles of the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration from 1867 to 1868.

==The Making of the Meiji Military==
After the Meiji Restoration, the government recognized the need for a stronger military force that placed their loyalty to the central government as opposed to individual domains. Under the new Meiji government, Ōmura was appointed to the post of &quot;hyōbu daiyu&quot;, which was equivalent to the role of Vice Minister of War in the newly created Army-Navy Ministry. In this role, Ōmura was tasked with the creation of a national army along Western lines. Ōmura sought to duplicate the policies he had previously successfully implemented in Chōshū on a larger scale, namely, the introduction of conscription and military training for commoners, rather than reliance on a hereditary feudal force. He also strongly supported the discussions towards the abolition of the han system, and with it, the numerous private armies maintained by the &quot;daimyō&quot;, which he considered a drain on resources and a potential threat to security.

During a council meeting in June 1869, Ōmura argued that if &quot;the government was determined to become militarily independent and powerful, it was necessary to abolish the fiefs and the feudal armies, to do away with the privileges of the samurai class, and to introduce universal military conscription&quot;. Ōmura&#x27;s ideal military consisted of an army patterned after that of the Napoleonic French armies and a navy that was patterned after the British Royal Navy. For this reason, even though the French government had lent tactic support to the Tokugawa regime during the wars of the Meiji Restoration through the supply of weapons and military advisors, Ōmura continued to push for the return of the French military mission to train his new troops.

Ōmura faced opposition from many of his peers, including from most conservative samurai who saw his ideas on modernizing and reforming the Japanese military as too radical. What Ōmura was advocating was not only ending the livelihood of thousands of samurai but also the end of their privileged position in society.

A man of strong character, Ōmura had come to entertain such disgust at the cramped military system of feudalism that a story is told of his refusing to talk to a close companion of arms who offended him by wearing his long samurai sword during a conference.

==Assassination==
It was the opposition of some of these &quot;samurai&quot; that led to his demise in the late 1860s. Although Prince Komatsu Akihito was nominally the minister in charge of military affairs, in practice Ōmura was the guiding force. Ōmura appointed his disciple, Yamada Akiyoshi as a vice minister and placed him in charge with the selection of non-commissioned officer candidates. Yamada selected about 100 people, mainly from various units of Chōshū Domain, and from September 5, began training at the Kawahigashi Training Center established in Kyoto. In September 1869, Ōmura established a military training barracks near Osaka Castle, where French instructors were located. In addition, it was decided that he would build a gunpowder factory in Uji, Kyoto, and an armory (Osaka Artillery Arsenal) in Osaka. His decision to move the core of the army to the Kansai region was partly due to geographic reasons (Osaka was more central than Tokyo, and it would be easier to respond to domestic incidents), and partly due to a desire to remove himself from the Ōkubo faction&#x27;s obstruction of his military reforms. Despite rumors and concerns raised by Kido Takayoshi and others about threats to Ōmura&#x27;s life, he decided to make an inspection tour of these new facilities in person. After inspecting the Fushimi Parade Ground in Kyoto, the site of the planned ammunition depot in Uji, military installations in Osaka Castle, and touring the naval base at Tempōzan, he returned to Kyoto on October 8. On the following evening, he had dinner at a &quot;ryōkan&quot; in Kiyamachi in Kyoto with Shizuma Hikotarō, a commander of a battalion of the Chōshū clan, and Adachi Konosuke, a teacher at the Fushimi Military Academy. In the middle of dinner, he was attacked by eight assassins, including Dan Shinjirō, a former Chōshū retainer. Shizuma and Adachi were killed, and Ōmura was seriously injured, with cuts to his forehead, left temple, arm, right finger, right elbow, and right knee joint, and barely escaped with his life by hiding in a bath full of dirty water. On September 20, he received treatment from Anthonius Franciscus Bauduin, a doctor with the Dutch legation and Ogata Koreyoshi, and was transferred to a hospital in Osaka. His stretcher was carried by Terauchi Masatake and Kodama Gentarō and he was looked after in the hospital by Kusumoto Ine and her daughter Ako. However, his condition did not improve, and he underwent surgery on October 27 to amputate his left thigh by Bauduin. However, as a report to the Ministry of War at the time stated, obtaining permission for the operation from the authorities in Tokyo took too long, and on November 1, he developed a high fever due to sepsis, his condition deteriorated, and he died on the night of the 5th. Ōmura&#x27;s assassins were soon apprehended and sentenced to death but were reprieved due to political pressure at the last moment by government officials who shared their views that Omura&#x27;s reforms were an affront to the &quot;samurai&quot; class. They were executed a year later.

On November 13, Ōmura was posthumously conferred the court rank of Junior Third Rank, and his widow was awarded 300 gold &quot;ryō&quot;. His body was returned to Yamaguchi where a funeral was held on November 20. His grave is located at the public graveyard in the village of Chusenji, now part of the city of Yamaguchi. The grave was designated as a National Historic Site in 1935. It is located about 25 minutes on foot from Yotsutsuji Station on the JR West San&#x27;yō Main Line.

In 1888, his grandson Ōmura Hiroto (the heir of his adopted son) was raised to the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage with a title of viscount for his grandfather&#x27;s achievement. Ōmura core theory of universal military conscription was formally adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army under Yamagata Aritomo in 1873.

==Legacy==

Soon after Ōmura&#x27;s death, a bronze statue was built in his honor by Ōkuma Ujihiro. The statue was placed in the monumental entry to Yasukuni Shrine, in Tokyo. The shrine was erected to Japanese who have died in battle and remains one of the most visited and respected shrines in Japan. The statue was the first Western-style sculpture in Japan

Ōmura&#x27;s ideas for modernizing Japan&#x27;s military were largely implemented after his death by his followers such as Yamagata Aritomo, Kido Takayoshi, and Yamada Akiyoshi. Yamada Akiyoshi was the strongest leader out of the four and was mainly responsible for establishing Japan&#x27;s modern military using Ōmura&#x27;s ideas. Yamada promoted Ōmura&#x27;s ideas by establishing new military academies that taught Ōmura&#x27;s ways. Yamagata Aritomo and Saigō Tsugumichi also had Ōmura&#x27;s ideas in mind when passing legislation imposing universal military conscription in 1873.

Yamagata Aritomo, a devoted follower of Ōmura, traveled to Europe to study military science and military techniques that could be adapted in Japan. Upon returning from Europe, he organized a 10,000-man force to form the core of the new Imperial Japanese Army. As Ōmura had hoped for, the French military mission returned in 1872 to help equip and train the new army. Although Ōmura died before having the opportunity to enforce many of his radical ideas, the lasting impression that he left on his followers led to his policies and ideas shaping the making of the Meiji military years later.

<doc id="316407" wikidata="Q540824" url="?curid=316407" title="Hillel II">
<text>Hillel II (Hebrew: הלל נשיאה, Hillel the Nasi), also known simply as Hillel, was an &quot;amora&quot; of the fifth generation in the Land of Israel. He held the office of &quot;Nasi&quot; of the Sanhedrin between 320 and 365 CE. He was the son and successor of Judah III. He is sometimes confused with Hillel the Elder, as the Talmud sometimes simply uses the name &quot;Hillel&quot;.

==Biography==
In two instances his name is quoted in connection with important decisions in Jewish law: in one, Jose ben Abin expounds to him a law; in the other, Hillel cites a mishnah to establish a law.

The emperor Julian the Apostate was gracious to Hillel, whom he honored on a number of occasions. In an autograph letter to him, Julian assured him of his friendship and promised to ameliorate further the condition of the Jews. Before setting out for the war with Persia, Julian addressed to the Jewish congregations a circular letter in which he informed them that he had &quot;committed the Jewish tax-rolls to the flames,&quot; and that, &quot;desiring to show them still greater favors, he has advised his brother, the venerable patriarch &quot;Julos&quot;, to abolish what was called the &#x27;send-tax&#x27;&quot;.

==Fixing of the calendar==

He is traditionally regarded as the creator of the modern fixed Jewish calendar. This tradition first appears in a responsum of R. Hai Gaon (written in 992) cited by R. Abraham bar Hiyya in his &quot;Sefer Ha&#x27;ibbur&quot; (written in 1123). The citation explicitly refers to the year that this event happened, 670 of the Seleucid era, which corresponds to 358/9 CE.

However, a number of documents have been found that indicate the calendar was not fully fixed in Hillel&#x27;s time; most famously a letter found in Cairo Geniza (from the year 835/6) indicates that the holidays were observed on different dates from those predicted by the current calendar. The calendar did not reach its exact modern form until at least the years 922–924. According to modern scholar Sacha Stern, Hai Gaon only attributed the establishment of a 19-year cycle, and not other details of the calendar, to Hillel.

The fixed calendar was of great benefit to Jews of his and subsequent generations. The Jewish calendar is lunisolar. That is, its months are synchronized with the phases of the moon, but its average year length approximates the mean length of a solar year. The Sanhedrin declared new months based on observations of the new moon, and added a 13th lunar month to certain years to ensure that holidays would continue to fall in the same seasons of the solar year. But Constantius II, following the precedents of Hadrian, prohibited the holding of such meetings as well as the vending of articles for distinctly Jewish purposes. The worldwide Jewish community depended on the calendar sanctioned by the Judean Sanhedrin to observe Jewish holidays on the correct dates. However, danger threatened the participants in that sanction and the messengers who communicated their decisions to distant congregations. Temporarily, to relieve the foreign congregations, Huna ben Abin once advised Rava not to wait for the official intercalation: &quot;When you are convinced that the winter quarter will extend beyond the sixteenth day of Nisan declare the year a leap year, and do not hesitate&quot;. But as the religious persecutions continued, Hillel decided to provide an authorized calendar for all time to come, though by doing so he severed the ties which united the Jews of the diaspora to their mother country and to the patriarchate.

==In Christian tradition==
According to Epiphanius of Salamis Hillel II was secretly baptized on his deathbed. The Christian convert Joseph of Tiberias was one of his disciples.

<text>Hillel ben Eliakim, known in Hebrew to Talmud scholars as Rabbeinu Hillel, (&quot;Our Rabbi Hillel&quot;), was a Greek rabbi and Talmud scholar. He lived during the 11th century and 12th century.

In his writings he mentions the name of his city, סלווידי. Some believe this refers to Silivri, others that it is a distortion of Saloniki, and other opinions exist too.

He was a pupil of Rashi, and is mentioned by Mordecai ben Hillel.

Hillel wrote the commentary &quot;Sifre ve Sifra Perush Rabbenu&quot; to Midrash, being a commentary on Sifrei and Sifra. In &quot;Sifra&quot; he often quotes Rashi and Isaac ben Melchizedek.

<text>A compass rose or compass star, sometimes called a wind rose or rose of the winds, is a polar diagram displaying the orientation of the cardinal directions (north, east, south, and west) and their intermediate points. It is used on compasses (including magnetic ones), maps (such as compass rose networks), or monuments. It is particularly common in navigation systems, including nautical charts, non-directional beacons (NDB), VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) systems, satellite navigation devices (&quot;GPS&quot;).

== Types ==

Linguistic anthropological studies have shown that most human communities have four points of cardinal direction. The names given to these directions are usually derived from either locally-specific geographic features (e.g. &quot;towards the hills&quot;, &quot;towards the sea&quot;) or from celestial bodies (especially the sun) or from atmospheric features (winds, temperature). Most mobile populations tend to adopt sunrise and sunset for East and West and the direction from where different winds blow to denote North and South.

=== Classical ===
The ancient Greeks originally maintained distinct and separate systems of points and winds. The four Greek cardinal points (, , and ) were based on celestial bodies and used for orientation. The four Greek winds (, , , ) were confined to meteorology. Nonetheless, both systems were gradually conflated, and wind names came eventually to denote cardinal directions as well.

In his meteorological studies, Aristotle identified ten distinct winds: two north–south winds (, ) and four sets of east–west winds blowing from different latitudes—the Arctic Circle (, ), the summer solstice horizon (, ), the equinox (, ) and the winter solstice (, ). Aristotle&#x27;s system was asymmetric. To restore balance, Timosthenes of Rhodes added two more winds to produce the classical 12-wind rose, and began using the winds to denote geographical direction in navigation. Eratosthenes deducted two winds from Aristotle&#x27;s system, to produce the classical eight-wind rose.

The Romans (e.g. Seneca, Pliny) adopted the Greek 12-wind system, and replaced its names with Latin equivalents, e.g. , , , , etc. The &quot;De architectura&quot; of the Roman architect Vitruvius describes 24 winds.

According to the chronicler Einhard (), the Frankish king Charlemagne himself came up with his own names for the classical 12 winds. During the Migration Period, the Germanic names for the cardinal directions entered the Romance languages, where they replaced the Latin names &quot;borealis&quot; with north, &quot;australis&quot; with south, &quot;occidentalis&quot; with west and &quot;orientalis&quot; with east.

The following table gives a rough equivalence of the classical 12-wind rose with the modern compass directions (Note: the directions are imprecise since it is not clear at what angles the classical winds are supposed to be with each other; some have argued that they should be equally spaced at 30 degrees each; for more details, see the article on Classical compass winds).


=== Sidereal ===

The sidereal compass rose demarcates the compass points by the position of stars (&quot;steering stars&quot;; not to be confused with zenith stars) in the night sky, rather than winds. Arab navigators in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, who depended on celestial navigation, were using a 32-point sidereal compass rose before the end of the 10th century. In the northern hemisphere, the steady Pole Star (Polaris) was used for the N–S axis; the less-steady Southern Cross had to do for the southern hemisphere, as the southern pole star, Sigma Octantis, is too dim to be easily seen from Earth with the naked eye. The other thirty points on the sidereal rose were determined by the rising and setting positions of fifteen bright stars. Reading from North to South, in their rising and setting positions, these are:

The western half of the rose would be the same stars in their setting position. The true position of these stars is only approximate to their theoretical equidistant rhumbs on the sidereal compass. Stars with the same declination formed a &quot;linear constellation&quot; or &quot;&quot; to provide direction as the night progressed.

A similar sidereal compass was used by Polynesian and Micronesian navigators in the Pacific Ocean, although different stars were used in a number of cases, clustering around the east–west axis.

=== Mariner&#x27;s ===
In Europe, the Classical 12-wind system continued to be taught in academic settings during the Medieval era, but seafarers in the Mediterranean came up with their own distinct 8-wind system. The mariners used names derived from the Mediterranean lingua franca, composed principally of Ligurian, mixed with Venetian, Sicilian, Provençal, Catalan, Greek and Arabic terms from around the Mediterranean basin. 
* (N) Tramontana
* (NE) Greco (or Bora)
* (E) Levante
* (SE) Scirocco (or Exaloc)
* (S) Ostro (or Mezzogiorno)
* (SW) Libeccio (or Garbino)
* (W) Ponente
* (NW) Maestro (or Mistral)

The exact origin of the mariner&#x27;s eight-wind rose is obscure. Only two of its point names (&quot;Ostro&quot;, &quot;Libeccio&quot;) have Classical etymologies, the rest of the names seem to be autonomously derived. Two Arabic words stand out: &quot;Scirocco&quot; (SE) from &quot;al-Sharq&quot; (الشرق – east in Arabic) and the variant &quot;Garbino&quot; (SW), from &quot;al-Gharb&quot; (الغرب – west in Arabic). This suggests the mariner&#x27;s rose was probably acquired by southern Italian seafarers; not from their classical Roman ancestors, but rather from Norman Sicily in the 11th to 12th centuries. The coasts of the Maghreb and Mashriq are SW and SE of Sicily respectively; the &quot;Greco&quot; (a NE wind), reflects the position of Byzantine-held Calabria-Apulia to the northeast of Arab Sicily, while the &quot;Maestro&quot; (a NW wind) is a reference to the Mistral wind that blows from the southern French coast towards northwest Sicily.

The 32-point compass used for navigation in the Mediterranean by the 14th century, had increments of 11° between points. Only the eight principal winds (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) were given special names. The eight half-winds just combined the names of the two principal winds, e.g. Greco-Tramontana for NNE, Greco-Levante for ENE, and so on. Quarter-winds were more cumbersomely phrased, with the closest principal wind named first and the next-closest principal wind second, e.g. &quot;Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco&quot; (literally, &quot;one quarter wind from North towards Northeast&quot;, i.e. North by East), and &quot;Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana&quot; (&quot;one quarter wind from NE towards N&quot;, i.e. Northeast by North). Boxing the compass (naming all 32 winds) was expected of all Medieval mariners.

== Depiction on nautical charts ==

In the earliest medieval portolan charts of the 14th century, compass roses were depicted as mere collections of color-coded compass rhumb lines: black for the eight main winds, green for the eight half-winds and red for the sixteen quarter-winds. The average portolan chart had sixteen such roses (or confluence of lines), spaced out equally around the circumference of a large implicit circle.

The cartographer Cresques Abraham of Majorca, in his Catalan Atlas of 1375, was the first to draw an ornate compass rose on a map. By the end of the 15th century, Portuguese cartographers began drawing multiple ornate compass roses throughout the chart, one upon each of the sixteen circumference roses (unless the illustration conflicted with coastal details).

The points on a compass rose were frequently labeled by the initial letters of the mariner&#x27;s principal winds (T, G, L, S, O, L, P, M). From the outset, the custom also began to distinguish the north from the other points by a specific visual marker. Medieval Italian cartographers typically used a simple arrowhead or circumflex-hatted T (an allusion to the compass needle) to designate the north, while the Majorcan cartographic school typically used a stylized Pole Star for its north mark. The use of the fleur-de-lis as north mark was introduced by Pedro Reinel, and quickly became customary in compass roses (and is still often used today). Old compass roses also often used a Christian cross at Levante (E), indicating the direction of Jerusalem from the point of view of the Mediterranean sea.

The twelve Classical winds (or a subset of them) were also sometimes depicted on portolan charts, albeit not on a compass rose, but rather separately on small disks or coins on the edges of the map.

The compass rose was also depicted on traverse boards used on board ships to record headings sailed at set time intervals.

== Modern depictions ==

The contemporary compass rose appears as two rings, one smaller and set inside the other. The outside ring denotes &quot;true&quot; cardinal directions while the smaller inside ring denotes &quot;magnetic&quot; cardinal directions. True north refers to the geographical location of the north pole while magnetic north refers to the direction towards which the north pole of a magnetic object (as found in a compass) will point. The angular difference between &quot;true&quot; and &quot;magnetic&quot; north is called variation, which varies depending on location. The angular difference between magnetic heading and compass heading is called deviation which varies by vessel and its heading. North arrows are often included in contemporary maps as part of the map layout.
The modern compass rose has eight principal winds. Listed clockwise, these are:

Although modern compasses use the names of the eight principal directions (N, NE, E, SE, etc.), older compasses use the traditional Italianate wind names of Medieval origin (Tramontana, Greco, Levante, etc.).

Four-point compass roses use only the four &quot;basic winds&quot; or &quot;cardinal directions&quot; (North, East, South, West), with angles of difference at 90°.

Eight-point compass roses use the eight principal winds—that is, the four cardinal directions (N, E, S, W) plus the four &quot;intercardinal&quot; or &quot;ordinal directions&quot; (NE, SE, SW, NW), at angles of difference of 45°.

Twelve-point compass roses, with markings 30° apart, are often painted on airport ramps to assist with the adjustment of aircraft magnetic compass compensators.

Sixteen-point compass roses are constructed by bisecting the angles of the principal winds to come up with intermediate compass points, known as half-winds, at angles of difference of 22°. The names of the half-winds are simply combinations of the principal winds to either side, principal then ordinal. E.g. North-northeast (NNE), East-northeast (ENE), etc. Using gradians, of which there are 400 in a circle, the sixteen-point rose has twenty-five gradians per point.

Thirty-two-point compass roses are constructed by bisecting these angles, and coming up with quarter-winds at 11° angles of difference. Quarter-wind names are constructed with the names &quot;X by Y&quot;, which can be read as &quot;one quarter wind from X toward Y&quot;, where X is one of the eight principal winds and Y is one of the two adjacent cardinal directions. For example, North-by-east (NbE) is one quarter wind from North towards East, Northeast-by-north (NEbN) is one quarter wind from Northeast toward North. Naming all 32 points on the rose is called &quot;boxing the compass&quot;.

The 32-point rose has 11° between points, but is easily found by halving divisions and may have been easier for those not using a 360° circle. Eight points make a right angle and a point is easy to estimate allowing bearings to be given such as &quot;two points off the starboard bow&quot;.

<text>Volcanic rocks (often shortened to volcanics in scientific contexts) are rocks formed from lava erupted from a volcano. Like all rock types, the concept of volcanic rock is artificial, and in nature volcanic rocks grade into hypabyssal and metamorphic rocks and constitute an important element of some sediments and sedimentary rocks. For these reasons, in geology, volcanics and shallow hypabyssal rocks are not always treated as distinct. In the context of Precambrian shield geology, the term &quot;volcanic&quot; is often applied to what are strictly metavolcanic rocks. Volcanic rocks and sediment that form from magma erupted into the air are called &quot;pyroclastics,&quot; and these are also technically sedimentary rocks.

Volcanic rocks are among the most common rock types on Earth&#x27;s surface, particularly in the oceans. On land, they are very common at plate boundaries and in flood basalt provinces. It has been estimated that volcanic rocks cover about 8% of the Earth&#x27;s current land surface.

==Characteristics==

===Setting and size===

Volcanic rocks are classified based on their formation environment and particle size. They can originate from lava flows or be ejected explosively as fragmented material known as tephra.
*Lava – When molten rock erupts and solidifies on the Earth&#x27;s surface, it forms coherent volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. The size and structure of lava formations vary, with common types including pahoehoe (smooth, ropy lava) and ʻaʻā (rough, jagged lava).
*Tephra – Fragmented volcanic material ejected during eruptions, which varies in size and composition. Tephra includes:
**Volcanic bomb – Large, semi-molten fragments ejected from a volcano that solidify before reaching the ground. They often acquire aerodynamic shapes due to their flight through the air.
**Lapilli – Rock fragments between 2 and 64 mm in diameter, formed from lava droplets or broken volcanic material. Lapilli can accumulate to form volcanic breccia or tuff.
**Volcanic ash – Fine particles (&lt;2 mm) of pulverized rock, minerals, and glass created during explosive eruptions. Ash can travel long distances, affecting air quality and climate.
The size and setting of volcanic rock influence its distribution, physical properties, and impact on the environment.
===Texture===

Volcanic rocks are usually fine-grained or aphanitic to glass in texture. They often contain clasts of other rocks and phenocrysts. Phenocrysts are crystals that are larger than the matrix and are identifiable with the unaided eye. Rhomb porphyry is an example with large rhomb shaped phenocrysts embedded in a very fine grained matrix.

Volcanic rocks often have a vesicular texture caused by voids left by volatiles trapped in the molten lava. Pumice is a highly vesicular rock produced in explosive volcanic eruptions.

===Chemistry===
Most modern petrologists classify igneous rocks, including volcanic rocks, 
by their chemistry when dealing with their origin. The fact that different mineralogies and textures may be developed from the same initial magmas has led petrologists to rely heavily on chemistry to look at a volcanic rock&#x27;s origin.
The chemical classification of igneous rocks is based first on the total content of silicon and alkali metals (sodium and potassium) expressed as weight fraction of silica and alkali oxides (K2O plus Na2O). These place the rock in one of the fields of the TAS diagram. Ultramafic rock and carbonatites have their own specialized classification, but these rarely occur as volcanic rocks. Some fields of the TAS diagram are further subdivided by the ratio of potassium oxide to sodium oxide. Additional classifications may be made on the basis of other components, such as aluminum or iron content.

Volcanic rocks are also broadly divided into subalkaline, alkaline, and peralkaline volcanic rocks. Subalkaline rocks are defined as rocks in which

SiO2 &lt; -3.3539 × 10−4 × A6 + 1.2030 × 10−2 × A5 - 1.5188 × 10−1 × A4 + 8.6096 × 10−1 × A3 - 2.1111 × A2 + 3.9492 × A + 39.0

where both silica and total alkali oxide content (A) are expressed as molar fraction. Because the TAS diagram uses weight fraction and the boundary between alkaline and subalkaline rock is defined in terms of molar fraction, the position of this curve on the TAS diagram is only approximate. Peralkaline volcanic rocks are defined as rocks having Na2O + K2O &gt; Al2O3, so that some of the alkali oxides must be present as aegirine or sodic amphibole rather than feldspar.

The chemistry of volcanic rocks is dependent on two things: the initial composition of the primary magma and the subsequent differentiation. Differentiation of most magmas tends to increase the silica (SiO2) content, mainly by crystal fractionation. The initial composition of most magmas is basaltic, albeit small differences in initial compositions may result in multiple differentiation series. The most common of these series are the tholeiitic, calc-alkaline, and alkaline.

===Mineralogy===
Most volcanic rocks share a number of common minerals. Differentiation of volcanic rocks tends to increase the silica (SiO2) content mainly by fractional crystallization. Thus, more evolved volcanic rocks tend to be richer in minerals with a higher amount of silica such as phyllo and tectosilicates including the feldspars, quartz polymorphs and muscovite. While still dominated by silicates, more primitive volcanic rocks have mineral assemblages with less silica, such as olivine and the pyroxenes. Bowen&#x27;s reaction series correctly predicts the order of formation of the most common minerals in volcanic rocks.

Occasionally, a magma may pick up crystals that crystallized from another magma; these crystals are called xenocrysts. Diamonds found in kimberlites are rare but well-known xenocrysts; the kimberlites do not create the diamonds, but pick them up and transport them to the surface of the Earth.

== Naming ==

Volcanic rocks are named according to both their chemical composition and texture. Basalt is a very common volcanic rock with low silica content. Rhyolite is a volcanic rock with high silica content. Rhyolite has silica content similar to that of granite while basalt is compositionally equal to gabbro. Intermediate volcanic rocks include andesite, dacite, trachyte, and latite.

Pyroclastic rocks are the product of explosive volcanism. They are often felsic (high in silica). Pyroclastic rocks are often the result of volcanic debris, such as ash, bombs and tephra, and other volcanic ejecta. Examples of pyroclastic rocks are tuff and ignimbrite.

Shallow intrusions, which possess structure similar to volcanic rather than plutonic rocks, are also considered to be volcanic, shading into subvolcanic.

The terms lava stone and lava rock are more used by marketers than geologists, who would likely say &quot;volcanic rock&quot; (because lava is a molten liquid and rock is solid). &quot;Lava stone&quot; may describe anything from a friable silicic pumice to solid mafic flow basalt, and is sometimes used to describe rocks that were never lava, but look as if they were (such as sedimentary limestone with dissolution pitting). To convey anything about the physical or chemical properties of the rock, a more specific term should be used; a good supplier will know what sort of volcanic rock they are selling.

== Composition of volcanic rocks ==
The sub-family of rocks that form from volcanic lava are called igneous volcanic rocks (to differentiate them from igneous rocks that form from magma below the surface, called igneous plutonic rocks).

The lavas of different volcanoes, when cooled and hardened, differ much in their appearance and composition. If a rhyolite lava-stream cools quickly, it can quickly freeze into a black glassy substance called obsidian. When filled with bubbles of gas, the same lava may form the spongy appearing pumice. Allowed to cool slowly, it forms a light-colored, uniformly solid rock called rhyolite.


The lavas, having cooled rapidly in contact with the air or water, are mostly finely crystalline or have at least fine-grained ground-mass representing that part of the viscous semi-crystalline lava flow that was still liquid at the moment of eruption. At this time they were exposed only to atmospheric pressure, and the steam and other gases, which they contained in great quantity were free to escape; many important modifications arise from this, the most striking being the frequent presence of numerous steam cavities (vesicular structure) often drawn out to elongated shapes subsequently filled up with minerals by infiltration (amygdaloidal structure).

As crystallization was going on while the mass was still creeping forward under the surface of the Earth, the latest formed minerals (in the ground-mass) are commonly arranged in subparallel winding lines that follow the direction of movement (fluxion or fluidal structure)—and larger early minerals that previously crystallized may show the same arrangement. Most lavas fall considerably below their original temperatures before emitted. In their behavior, they present a close analogy to hot solutions of salts in water, which, when they approach the saturation temperature, first deposit a crop of large, well-formed crystals (labile stage) and subsequently precipitate clouds of smaller less perfect crystalline particles (metastable stage).

In igneous rocks the first generation of crystals generally forms before the lava has emerged to the surface, that is to say, during the ascent from the subterranean depths to the crater of the volcano. It has frequently been verified by observation that freshly emitted lavas contain large crystals borne along in a molten, liquid mass. The large, well-formed, early crystals (phenocrysts) are said to be porphyritic; the smaller crystals of the surrounding matrix or ground-mass belong to the post-effusion stage. More rarely lavas are completely fused at the moment of ejection; they may then cool to form a non-porphyritic, finely crystalline rock, or if more rapidly chilled may in large part be non-crystalline or glassy (vitreous rocks such as obsidian, tachylyte, pitchstone).

A common feature of glassy rocks is the presence of rounded bodies (spherulites), consisting of fine divergent fibres radiating from a center; they consist of imperfect crystals of feldspar, mixed with quartz or tridymite; similar bodies are often produced artificially in glasses that are allowed to cool slowly. Rarely these spherulites are hollow or consist of concentric shells with spaces between (lithophysae). Perlitic structure, also common in glasses, consists of the presence of concentric rounded cracks owing to contraction on cooling.
The phenocrysts or porphyritic minerals are not only larger than those of the ground-mass; as the matrix was still liquid when they formed they were free to take perfect crystalline shapes, without interference by the pressure of adjacent crystals. They seem to have grown rapidly, as they are often filled with enclosures of glassy or finely crystalline material like that of the ground-mass . Microscopic examination of the phenocrysts often reveals that they have had a complex history. Very frequently they show layers of different composition, indicated by variations in color or other optical properties; thus augite may be green in the center surrounded by various shades of brown; or they may be pale green centrally and darker green with strong pleochroism (aegirine) at the periphery.

In the feldspars the center is usually richer in calcium than the surrounding layers, and successive zones may often be noted, each less calcic than those within it. Phenocrysts of quartz (and of other minerals), instead of sharp, perfect crystalline faces, may show rounded corroded surfaces, with the points blunted and irregular tongue-like projections of the matrix into the substance of the crystal. It is clear that after the mineral had crystallized it was partly again dissolved or corroded at some period before the matrix solidified.

Corroded phenocrysts of biotite and hornblende are very common in some lavas; they are surrounded by black rims of magnetite mixed with pale green augite. The hornblende or biotite substance has proved unstable at a certain stage of consolidation, and has been replaced by a paramorph of augite and magnetite, which may partially or completely substitute for the original crystal but still retains its characteristic outlines.

==Mechanical behaviour of volcanic rocks==
The mechanical behaviour of volcanic rocks is complicated by their complex microstructure. For example, attributes such as the partitioning of the void space (pores and microcracks), pore and crystal size and shape, and hydrothermal alteration can all vary widely in volcanic rocks and can all influence the resultant mechanical behaviour (e.g., Young&#x27;s modulus, compressive and tensile strength, and the pressure at which they transition from brittle to ductile behaviour). As for other crustal rocks, volcanic rocks are brittle and ductile at low and high effective confining pressures, respectively. Brittle behaviour is manifest as faults and fractures, and ductile behaviour can either be distributed (cataclastic pore collapse) or localised (compaction bands). Understanding the mechanical behaviour of volcanic rocks can help us better understand volcanic hazards, such as flank collapse.

<text>Hillel, son of Gamaliel III, was a Jewish scholar in the 3rd century CE (second generation of amoraim).

==Biography==
He was son of Gamaliel III, brother of Judah II, and probably a pupil of his grandfather Judah I. 

Of his early history nothing is known. As illustrating his modesty the following incidents may be quoted: He and his brother were once at Biri, where people remonstrated against their walking on the Sabbath in shoes with golden buckles, which was not customary at that place: they resignedly removed their shoes and handed them over to their accompanying slaves. On another occasion at Cabul they were about to bathe together when the people informed them that they did not consider it moral for brothers to bathe together: Hillel and his brother thereupon desisted. In either case they could have shown the people that their acts were perfectly legal, but they preferred to comply with the local customs.

While Hillel is not often quoted in connection with Jewish law, he was an able interpreter of the Hebrew Bible; this accounts for Origen seeking his society and consulting him frequently on difficult Biblical passages.

It was probably this Hillel that declared, &quot;The Jews have no Messiah to expect, for they have already consumed him in the days of Hezekiah&quot;.

Some credit this Hillel, and not his better-known namesake, with the authorship of the following maxims: &quot;Separate not yourself from the community&quot;; &quot;Be not confident in thyself until the day of your death&quot;; &quot;Condemn not your neighbor until you have been placed in his condition&quot;; &quot;Use no unintelligible expressions assuming that ultimately they will be understood&quot;; &quot;Say not &#x27;When I have leisure I shall study&#x27;: you may never be at leisure&quot;.

<text>Hillel ben Naphtali Zevi (; 1615 – January 3, 1690) also known as Hillel Ben Naphtali Herz, was a Lithuanian rabbi.

==Biography==
He was born at Brest-Litovsk in 1615; he died at Zolkiev (Zhovkva) January 3, 1690. After he had studied under Hirsh Darshan, Hillel went to Vilna, where from 1650 to 1651 he was a member of the rabbinical college, and the &quot;bet din&quot; (Jewish court) of Moses ben Isaac Judah Lima where he was one of the signatories to a halakhic decision that women could not be deprived of their right to oppose divorce against their will. He stayed at Vilna until 1666, then became rabbi in Kėdainiai and several other Lithuanian towns. He was called in 1670 as rabbi to Altona and Hamburg, and in 1680 to Zolkiev. He was also a delegate to the Council of the Four Lands at the fair of Yaroslav.

Hillel was the author of an important work entitled &quot;Bet Hillel,&quot; a commentary and &quot;novellæ&quot; on the four parts of the &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot;, an important code of Jewish law. His son, Moses ben Hillel, published only the portions on &quot;Yoreh De&#x27;ah&quot; and &quot;Eben ha-Ezer&quot;, with the text (Dyhernfurth, 1691). He also wrote under the same title a homiletic and mystical commentary on the Pentateuch.

<text>was a Japanese statesman and &quot;waka&quot; poet in the Nara period. He was one of the &quot;Man&#x27;yō no Go-taika,&quot; the five great poets of his time, and was part of Fujiwara no Kintō&#x27;s .

Yakamochi was a member of the prestigious Ōtomo clan. Like his grandfather and father before him, Yakamochi was a well-known politician, and by Enryaku rose to the position of , his highest bureaucratic position.

==The Otomo Clan==
The Otomo clan was a powerful clan that flourished from the 5th to 9th centuries.

They are said to have descended from Ame-no-Oshihi-no-Mikoto, who served as a precursor to Amaterasu&#x27;s grandson, Ninigi no Mikoto, and together with the Monobe clan were responsible for the military affairs of the Yamato kingdom and were also active in politics.

==Genealogy==
Father: Otomo Tabito
Mother: Tambirou-no-musume
Wife: Otomo Sakanoue Oiratume 
Children of unknown birth mother
Male: Otomo Naganushi

== Biography ==
Yakamochi was born into the Ōtomo clan; his grandfather was Ōtomo no Yasumaro and his father was Ōtomo no Tabito. The Ōtomo clan were warriors and bureaucrats in the Yamato Court, and Yakamochi served as a in several provinces. He was the nephew of Ōtomo no Sakanoue no Iratsume, who was also poet and a favorite of Prince Hozumi. When Tabito died in 731, Yakamochi became the head of the Ōtomo family.

In 738, he met Udoneri, and in 740 at the behest of Emperor Shōmu went to Dazaifu (Kyūshū) to suppress the rebellion of Fujiwara no Hirotsugu. In 745 he achieved the rank of in the Imperial court. In July of the following year, he became governor of Etchū Province, a post he lasted in until 751. By this time he was already the author of 220 &quot;waka&quot;. In 751 he was promoted to and returned to the capital.

In 754 he was appointed , and the following year concerned himself with the at Nanba, a time that is described in the &quot;Sakimori Songs Collection&quot; in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. Yakamochi did not take part in the . Instead, he conspired with Fujiwara no Yoshitsugu, Isonokami Yakatsugu and Saeki no Imaemishi to plot the assassination of Fujiwara no Nakamaro. Afterwards Yoshitsugu took sole responsibility for the affair, but due to suspicions about Yakamochi&#x27;s involvement he was transferred to the governorship of Satsuma Province.

In 777, he rose to the governorship of Ise Province. According to the records of the , he served in this post for about five years. In 780 he was promoted to . Fearing suspicion and banishment from the capital for aiding in Hikami no Kawatsugu&#x27;s , he remained quiet and was promoted to in 783.

He died in 785 by drowning in Mutsu Province while attending to his concurrent post as &quot;shōgun&quot;. Soon after his death, Fujiwara no Tanetsugu was assassinated; suspecting that Yakamochi was involved in the affair, his burial was denied and he was posthumously disgraced and excommunicated. His son was stripped of rank and forced into exile, and it was only in 806 that he regained his rank.

== Poetic works ==
A theory holds that Yakamochi was the compiler (or the final compiler) of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, the first poetry anthology created in Japanese history, for which he not only wrote several poems but also transcribed, rewrote, and refashioned an unknown number of ancient poems and folklore. About 481 of the poems included in the anthology were his works. He was the most prolific and prominent writer of his time, and had a great influence on the &quot;Shika Wakashū&quot; as well. The famous Gunka song &quot;Umi Yukaba&quot; used one of his most famous and outstanding poem as lyrics, and was considered Japan&#x27;s second anthem during wartime. It was the anthem of the Japanese navy, serving as the send-off song for sailors at the beginning of the war in 1937. It also formed part of the Japanese military appropriation of high culture for the historical justification of its existence.

He wrote a eulogy (&quot;banka&quot;) for Prince Asaka (安積皇子 &quot;Asaka-no-miko&quot;).

==Statue of Otomo Yakamochi==
In 1981, a statue of Otomo Yakamochi was installed in the station square at the north exit of JR Takaoka Station to commemorate the first Takaoka Manyo Festival. Later, when the statue was temporarily removed and repaired in conjunction with the JR Takaoka Station area development project, there were opinions to move the statue to the Fushiki district, where the Koshinokufu, Yakamochi&#x27;s post, existed, but in the end it was decided to install it again at the north exit of the station as a symbol of Takaoka Station.

In addition, a statue of Otomo Yakamochi exists near the Kawauchi Historical Museum and in front of Kawauchi Station in Satsumasendai City, Kagoshima Prefecture, where he was assigned as the Satsuma provincial governor, as one of the &quot;historical statues to tell to the future&quot;

<text>The Three Kingdoms of Korea or Samhan (Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla) competed for hegemony over the Korean Peninsula during the ancient period of Korean history. During the Three Kingdoms period (), many states and statelets consolidated until, after Buyeo was annexed in 494 and Gaya was annexed in 562, only three remained on the Korean Peninsula: Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla. The &quot;Korean Three Kingdoms&quot; contributed to what would become Korea; and the Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla peoples became the Korean people.

The three kingdoms occupied the entire peninsula and roughly half of Manchuria (modern-day Northeast China and small parts of the Russian Far East). Goguryeo controlled the northern half of the peninsula, as well as Liaodong Peninsula and Manchuria. Baekje and Silla occupied the southern half of the peninsula. The island kingdoms of Tamna and Usan were subordinated to Baekje and Silla, respectively.

All three kingdoms shared a similar culture and language. Baekje and Goguryeo shared founding myths which likely originated in Buyeo. Buddhism, which arrived in Korea in the 3rd century AD from India via Tibet and China, became the state religion of all constituents of the three kingdoms, starting with Goguryeo in 372 AD. The Three Kingdoms of Korea all had a warrior aristocracy in contrast to the literary elite of China.

The period ended in the 7th century, after Silla allied with Tang China and unified the peninsula for the first time in history. After the fall of Baekje and Goguryeo, the Tang dynasty established a short-lived military government to administer parts of the Korean Peninsula. Silla was joined by Goguryeo and Baekje loyalists and fought the Tang for hegemony over the Korean Peninsula. Silla was eventually divided into the Later Three Kingdoms and ultimately annexed by the new Goguryeo revivalist state of Goryeo.

==Nomenclature ==

Beginning in the 7th century, the name &quot;Samhan&quot; became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The &quot;Han&quot; in the names of the Korean Empire, &quot;Daehan Jeguk&quot;, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), &quot;Daehan Minguk&quot; or &quot;Hanguk&quot;, are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.

According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, Silla implemented a national policy, &quot;Samhan Unification&quot; (), to integrate Baekje and Goguryeo refugees. In 1982, a memorial stone dating to 686 was discovered in Cheongju with an inscription: &quot;The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded.&quot; During the Later Silla period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged. In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo. By the Goryeo period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea. In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, Wang Geon declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the Joseon period and was widely referenced in the &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;.

In China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century. The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the Tang dynasty. Goguryeo was alternately called Mahan by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals &quot;Mahan leaders&quot; () in 645. In 651, Emperor Gaozong of Tang sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan. Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea &quot;Samhan&quot;, especially Goguryeo. For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon (), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a &quot;Liaodong Samhan man&quot; ().

The name &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; was used in the titles of the Korean histories &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; (12th century) and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; (13th century), and should not be confused with the Three Kingdoms of China.

==Foundation ==
The Three Kingdoms were founded after the fall of Wiman Joseon and gradually conquered and absorbed various other small states and confederacies. After the fall of Gojoseon, the Han dynasty established four commanderies in the northwestern Korean Peninsula and present Liaoning. Three fell quickly to the Samhan, and the last was destroyed by Goguryeo in 313.

The nascent precursors of Baekje and Silla expanded within the web of statelets during the Proto-Three Kingdoms period, and Goguryeo conquered neighboring state like Buyeo in Manchuria and chiefdoms in Okjeo, Dongye which occupied the northeastern Korean Peninsula. The three polities made the transition from walled-town state to full-fledged state-level societies between 1st – 3rd century AD.

The primary sources for this period include &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; in Korea, and the &quot;Eastern Barbarians&quot; section (東夷傳) from the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; (魏書) of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; in China.

All three kingdoms shared a similar culture and language. The &quot;Book of Sui&quot; (Volume 81) recorded: &quot;The customs, laws and clothes of Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla are generally identical.&quot; Their original religions appear to have been shamanistic, but they were increasingly influenced by Chinese culture, particularly Confucianism and Taoism. In the 4th century, Buddhism was introduced to the peninsula and spread rapidly, briefly becoming the official religion of all three kingdoms.

According to Lisa Kay Bailey, the material culture of the Three Kingdoms can be clearly distinguished as they displayed cultural influence from different regions. Goguryeo&#x27;s culture showed stronger influence from northern Chinese art, Baekche showed stronger influence from southern Chinese art, and Silla, which was more distant from China, showed greater influence from Eurasian steppe nomad cultures and greater preservation of native traditions. During this period, the Three Kingdoms had yet to unify their separate identities. Each kingdom produced their own individual histories; only in the Goryeo dynasty period was the collective history of the Korean Peninsula written together.

&quot;The decline of Chinese power in the fourth century unleashed a wave of refugees that proved pivotal in speeding up the process of state-building in Korea,&quot; starting the Three Kingdoms era.

==Kingdoms==

===Goguryeo===

Goguryeo emerged on the north and south banks of the Yalu (Amrok) River, in the wake of Gojoseon&#x27;s fall. The first mention of Goguryeo in Chinese records dates from 75 BC in reference to a commandery established by the Chinese Han dynasty, although even earlier mentions of &quot;Guri&quot; () may be of the same state. Evidence indicates Goguryeo was the most advanced, and likely the first established, of the three kingdoms.

Goguryeo, eventually the largest of the three kingdoms, had several capitals in alternation: two capitals in the upper Yalu area, and later Nangrang (&quot;Lelang&quot; in Chinese) which is now part of Pyongyang. At the beginning, the state was located on the border with China; it gradually expanded into Manchuria and destroyed the Chinese Lelang commandery in 313. The cultural influence of the Chinese continued as Buddhism was adopted as the official religion in 372.

Goguryeo was a highly militaristic state; it was a powerful empire and one of the great powers in East Asia. The state was at its zenith in the 5th century, during the rule of King Gwanggaeto the Great and his son King Jangsu, and particularly during their campaign in Manchuria. For the next century or so, Goguryeo was the dominant nation in Manchuria and the northern Korean peninsula. Goguryeo eventually occupied the Liaodong Plains in Manchuria and today&#x27;s Seoul area. Gwanggaeto achieved a loose unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

Goguryeo also controlled Tungusic tribes in Manchuria. After the establishment of the Sui dynasty and later the Tang dynasty in China, the kingdom continued to take aggressive actions against China, Silla, and Baekje attacks until it was conquered by allied Silla–Tang forces in 668. Most of its territory was absorbed by the Tang dynasty of China, and the territory of Baekje was absorbed by Silla.

===Baekje===

Baekje was founded as a member of the Mahan confederacy. Two sons of the founder of Goguryeo are recorded to have fled a succession conflict, to establish Baekje around the present Seoul area. Baekje absorbed or conquered other Mahan chiefdoms and, at its peak in the 4th century, controlled most of the western Korean Peninsula. Buddhism was introduced to Baekje in 384 from Goguryeo, which Baekje welcomed.

Baekje was a great maritime power; its nautical skill, which made it the Phoenicia of East Asia, was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan. Baekje played a fundamental role in transmitting cultural and material developments to ancient Japan, including Chinese written characters, Chinese and Korean literature, technologies such as ferrous metallurgy and ceramics, architectural styles, sericulture and Buddhism.

Baekje exerted its political influence on Tamna, a kingdom that ruled Jeju Island. Baekje maintained a close relationship with and extracted tribute from Tamna. Baekje&#x27;s religious and artistic culture influenced Goguryeo and Silla. Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of Geunchogo, but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto and declined.

In the late 5th century, under attack from Goguryeo, the capital of Baekje was moved south to Ungjin (present-day Gongju) and later further south to Sabi (present-day Buyeo). Baekje was conquered by Silla-Tang alliance in 660, submitting the Unified Silla.

===Silla===

According to Korean records, in 57 BC, Seorabeol (or Saro, later Silla) in the southeast of the peninsula unified and expanded the confederation of city-states known as Jinhan. Although &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records that Silla was the earliest-founded of the three kingdoms, other written and archaeological records indicate that Silla was likely the last of the three to establish a centralized government. Silla was the smallest and weakest of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its great advantage.

Renamed from Saro to Silla in 503, the kingdom annexed the Gaya confederacy (which in turn had absorbed Byeonhan earlier) in the first half of the 6th century. Goguryeo and Baekje responded by forming an alliance. To cope with invasions from Goguryeo and Baekje, Silla deepened its relations with the Tang dynasty, with her newly gained access to the Yellow Sea making direct contact with the Tang possible. After the conquest of Goguryeo and Baekje with her Tang allies, the Silla kingdom drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula and occupied the lands south of Pyongyang.

The capital of Silla was Seorabeol (now Gyeongju; &quot;Seorabeol&quot;, &quot;서라벌&quot;, is hypothesized to have been the ancient Korean term for &quot;capital&quot;). Buddhism became the official religion in 528. The remaining material culture from the kingdom of Silla including unique gold metalwork shows influence from the northern nomadic steppes, differentiating it from the cultures of Goguryeo and Baekje where Chinese influence was more pronounced.

===Other states===
Other smaller states or regions existed in Korea before and during this period:

*The Gaya confederacy was a confederacy of small kingdoms in the Nakdong River valley of southern Korea since AD 42, growing out of the Byeonhan confederacy of the Samhan period. Archaeologists interpret mounded burial cemeteries of the late 3rd and early 4th centuries such as Daeseong-dong in Gimhae and Bokcheon-dong in Busan as the royal burial grounds of Gaya polities. Gaya polities had economies that were based on agriculture, fishing, casting, and long-distance trade. Gaya polities exported abundant quantities of iron ore, iron armor, and other weaponry to Baekje and the Kingdom of Wa. Constantly engaged in war with the three kingdoms surrounding it, Gaya was not developed to form a unified state and was ultimately absorbed into Silla in 562.
*Dongye, Okjeo, and Buyeo were all conquered by Goguryeo
*Usan (Ulleung-do) tributary of Silla
*Tamna (Jeju Province) tributary of Baekje
==Religion==
Centuries after Buddhism originated in India, the Mahayana Buddhism arrived in China through the Silk Route in 1st century AD from Tibet, then to Korean Peninsula in the 3rd century from where it transmitted to Japan. In Korea, it was adopted by the state religion by three constituent polities, first by the Goguryeo ruling tribe of Geumgwan Gaya in 372 AD, by the Silla in 528 AD, and by the Baekje in 552 AD.

==Decline ==

Allied with China under the Tang dynasty, Silla conquered Goguryeo in 668, after having already conquered Gaya in 562 and Baekje in 660, thus ushering in the North–South states period with Later Silla to the south and Balhae to the north, when Dae Jo-young, a former Goguryeo military officer, revolted against Tang Chinese rule and began reconquering former Goguryeo territories.

==Archaeological evidence ==
Archaeologists use theoretical guidelines derived from anthropology, ethnology, analogy, and ethnohistory to the concept of what defines a state-level society. This is different from the concept of state (&quot;guk&quot; or Sino ko: 國, walled-town state, etc.) in the discipline of Korean history.

In anthropological archaeology the presence of urban centres (especially capitals), monumental architecture, craft specialization and standardization of production, ostentatious burials, writing or recording systems, bureaucracy, demonstrated political control of geographical areas that are usually larger in area than a single river valley, etc. make up some of these correlates that define states.

Among the archaeology sites dating to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, hundreds of cemeteries with thousands of burials have been excavated. The vast majority of archaeological evidence of the Three Kingdoms period of Korea consists of burials, but since the 1990s there has been a great increase in the archaeological excavations of ancient industrial production sites, roads, palace grounds and elite precincts, ceremonial sites, commoner households, and fortresses due to the boom in salvage archaeology in South Korea.

Rhee and Choi hypothesize that a mix of internal developments and external factors lead to the emergence of state-level societies in Korea. A number of archaeologists including Kang demonstrate the role of frequent warfare in the development of peninsular states.

===Foundation (c. 1 – 300/400 AD)===

Some individual correlates of complex societies are found in the chiefdoms of Korea that date back to . The best evidence from the archaeological record indicates that states formed between 300 BC and 300/400 AD. However, archaeologists are not prepared to suggest that this means there were states in the BC era. The correlates of state-level societies did not develop as a package but rather in spurts and starts and at various points in time. It was some time between 100 and 400 AD that individual correlates of state societies had developed to a sufficient number and scale that state-level societies can be confidently identified using archaeological data.

===Burials===

Lee Sung-Joo analyzed variability in many of the elite cemeteries of the territories of Silla and Gaya polities and found that as late as the 2nd century there was intra-cemetery variation in the distribution of prestige grave goods, but there was an absence of hierarchical differences on a regional scale between cemeteries. Near the end of the 2nd century AD, interior space in elite burials increased in size, and wooden chamber burial construction techniques were increasingly used by elites.

In the 3rd century, a pattern developed in which single elite cemeteries that were the highest in status compared to all the other cemeteries were built. Such cemeteries were established at high elevations along ridgelines and on hilltops. Furthermore, the uppermost elite were buried in large-scale tombs established at the highest point of a given cemetery. Cemeteries with &#x27;uppermost elite&#x27; mounded burials such as Okseong-ri, Yangdong-ri, Daeseong-dong, and Bokcheon-dong display this pattern.
===Factory-scale production of pottery and roof-tiles===

Lee Sung-Joo proposed that, in addition to the development of regional political hierarchies as seen through analysis of burials, variation in types of pottery production gradually disappeared and full-time specialization was the only recognizable kind of pottery production from the end of the 4th century A.D. At the same time the production centers for pottery became highly centralized and vessels became standardized.

Centralisation and elite control of production is demonstrated by the results of the archaeological excavations at Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ni in Gyeongju. These sites are part of what was an interconnected and sprawling ancient industrial complex on the northeast outskirts of the Silla capital. Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ri are examples of the large-scale of specialized factory-style productions in the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla periods. The site was excavated in the late 1990s, and archaeologists found the remains of many production features such as pottery kilns, roof-tile kilns, charcoal kilns, as well as the remains of buildings and workshops associated with production.

===Capital cities, elite precincts, and monumental architecture===

Since the establishment of Goguryeo, its early history is well attested archaeologically: the first and second capital cities, Jolbon and Gungnae city, are located in and around today&#x27;s Ji&#x27;an, Jilin. In 2004, the site was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Since 1976, continuing archaeological excavations concentrated in the southeastern part of modern Gyeongju have revealed parts of the so-called &quot;Silla Wanggyeong&quot; (Silla royal capital). A number of excavations over the years have revealed temples such as Hwangnyongsa, Bunhwangsa, Heungryunsa, and 30 other sites. Signs of Baekje&#x27;s capitals have also been excavated at the Mongchon Fortress and the Pungnap Fortress in Seoul.

<text>Mount Hermon ( / ALA-LC: (&#x27;Mountain of the Sheikh&#x27;, ), , ) is a mountain cluster constituting the southern end of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range. Its summit straddles the border between Syria and Lebanon and, at above sea level, is the highest point in Syria. and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

On the top, in the United Nations buffer zone between Syrian and Israeli-occupied (originally Syrian) territories, is the highest permanently manned UN position in the world, known as &quot;Hermon Hotel&quot;, located at 2814 metres altitude (). The southern slopes of Mount Hermon extend to the Israeli-occupied portion of the Golan Heights, where the Mount Hermon ski resort is located with a top elevation of .

==Geography==
===Wider mountain range===
The Anti-Lebanon range, of which the Hermon range constitutes the southernmost part, extends for approximately in a northeast–southwest direction, running parallel to the Lebanon range on the west.

===Hermon range===
The relatively narrow Hermon range, with the Lebanon-Syria boundary along its spine, extends for , from northeast of Mt. Hermon to southwest of it. The Hermon range covers an area of about of which about are under Israeli control. Mount Hermon is a cluster of mountains with three distinct summits, each about the same height. Most of the portion of Mount Hermon within the Israeli-controlled area constitutes the Hermon nature reserve.

===Water and flora===
The mountain forms one of the greatest geographic resources of the area. Because of its height it captures a great deal of precipitation in a very dry area of the world. The Jurassic limestone is broken by faults and solution channels to form a karst topography. Mount Hermon has seasonal winter and spring snow falls, which cover all three of its peaks for most of the year. Melt water from the snow-covered mountain&#x27;s western and southern bases seeps into the rock channels and pores, feeding springs at the base of the mountain, which form streams and rivers. These merge to become the Jordan River.

The runoff facilitates fertile plant life below the snow line, where vineyards and pine, oak, and poplar trees are abundant. Two Jewish liturgical poems from the 8th and 10th centuries indicate that vineyards were cultivated in the Hermon area during the early medieval period.

===Strategic importance===
The springs, and the mountain itself, are much contested by the nations of the area for the use of the water. Mount Hermon is also called the &quot;snowy mountain&quot;, the &quot;gray-haired mountain&quot;, and the &quot;mountain of snow&quot;. It is also called &quot;the eyes of the nation&quot; in Israel because its elevation makes it Israel&#x27;s primary strategic early warning system.

== Religious significance ==
Various temples can be found in villages on the slopes of Mount Hermon.

Mount Hermon&#x27;s name has been related to the Semitic root &quot;ḥrm&quot;, which means &quot;taboo&quot; or &quot;consecrated&quot;, as in Hebrew &quot;ḥerem&quot; (in several contexts: property, priestly gift and censure), and in the Arabic term &quot;al-ḥaram&quot;, which means &quot;sacred enclosure&quot;. The name Hermon does not appear in texts prior to the Bible, but other names of the mountain that are mentioned in the Bible: Siryon and Senir, appear in Bronze and Iron age texts.

=== Execration texts ===
in the Egyptian execration texts from the 19th century BC, &quot;šrynw&quot; (Siryon) is mentioned.

===Epic of Gilgamesh===
The Epic of Gilgamesh mentions that Mount Hermon split after Gilgamesh killed Humbaba, the Guardian of the Cedar Forest. One translation of Tablet V states, &quot;The ground split open with the heels of their feet, as they whirled around in circles Mt. Hermon and Lebanon split.&quot;

One of the versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh mentions &quot;ša-ri-a ù la-ab-na-na&quot; – Siryon and Lebanon – as the place of Anunnaki. This indicates Amorite influence.

=== Hittite contract ===
In the contract between Muršili II and Duppi-Teššup of Amurru, two of the mountains that appear among the gods that witness the alliance are Lebanon and Siryon (&quot;šá-ri-ya-nu&quot;).

===Ugaritic religion===
In the Ugaritic Baal Cycle, tablet KTU 1.4 IV, Baal goes &quot;to Lebanon and his trees, Siryon – his desired cedars&quot; for construction materials.

The mountain or summit is referred to as Saphon in Ugaritic texts where the palace of Ba&#x27;al is located in a myth about Attar.

=== Assyrian royal inscriptions ===
In the royal inscriptions of Shalmaneser III, Shalmaneser wrote that Hazael fortified the peak of mount &quot;sa-ni-ru&quot; (Senir) &quot;which is before mount Lebanon&quot;, and that after the defeat of Hazael, Shalmaneser marched to the Hauran. In another part, Shalmaneser wrote that in his way from mount Lebanon to the cities of Hazael, he passed mount Saniru.

The inscriptions of Esarhaddon mention several times cedars and cypresses from the mountains Lebanon and Sirara as construction materials; Sirara may be a version of Siryon.

===Hebrew Bible and apocrypha===

In Deuteronomy 3:8–9 and Joshua 12:1 and 13:11, Mount Hermon is depicted as the northern boundary of the Amorite kingdom, which following the conquest by Joshua was awarded to the half-tribe of Manasseh east of the Jordan River.

The Hebrew Bible uses three names for Mount Hermon, stating in Deut 3:9 that &quot;the Sidonians call Hermon Siryon, while the Amorites call it Senir&quot;, but elsewhere (1Chr 5:23) seems to distinguish between Senir and Hermon, probably using the names for two of the three peaks of the Hermon range, while in Psalm 42:6 the Hebrew text uses the plural form, Hermonim, possibly also a reference to the three peaks.

The pair Siryon and Lebanon appears in Psalm 29, which is considered by Scholars to have Canaanite origin or roots.

The Book of Chronicles mentions Mount Hermon as a place where Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel were the heads of their families (1 Chronicles 5:23-24).

In Psalm 42, which leads the Psalms of the northern kingdom, the Psalmist remembers God from the land of Jordan and the Hermonites. In Song of Songs 4:8, Hermon is an instance of an exotic locale, and Psalm 133, one of the Songs of Ascents, makes specific reference to the abundant dew formation upon Mount Hermon. The Book of Ezekiel (27:5), meanwhile, praises its cypresses (referring to it by its alternate name, Senir (cf. Deut. 3:9)).

In the apocryphal Book of Enoch, Mount Hermon is the place where the Watcher class of fallen angels descended to Earth. They swear upon the mountain that they would take wives among the daughters of men and take mutual imprecation for their sin ().

According to the controversial research by Professor Israel Knohl of the Hebrew University, in his book &quot;Hashem&quot;, Mount Hermon is actually the Mount Sinai mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, with the biblical story reminiscent of an ancient battle of the northern tribes with the Egyptians somewhere in the Jordan Valley or Golan Heights.

===New Testament===
R.T. France, in his book on the Gospel of Matthew, noted that Mount Hermon was a possible location of the Transfiguration of Jesus, just
as it has elsewhere been described as the site accepted by most scholars.

===Qasr Antar inscription and Hermon as the &quot;mountain of oath&quot;===
There is a sacred building made of hewn blocks of stone on the summit of Mount Hermon. Known as Qasr Antar, it is the highest temple of the ancient world and was documented by Sir Charles Warren in 1869. An inscription on a limestone stele recovered by Warren from Qasr Antar was translated by George Nickelsburg to read &quot;According to the command of the greatest a(nd) Holy God, those who take an oath (proceed) from here.&quot; Nickelsburg connected the inscription with the oath taken by the angels under Semjaza who took an oath together, bound by a curse, in order to take human wives in the Book of Enoch (1 Enoch 6:6). Hermon was said to have become known as &quot;the mountain of oath&quot; by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau. The name of God was supposed to be a Hellenized version of Baʿal or Hadad and Nickelsburg connected it with the place name of Baal-Hermon (Lord of Hermon) and the deity given by Enoch as &quot;The Great Holy One&quot;.

===Deir El Aachayer Roman temple===
Another Greek inscription found in a large temple at Deir El Aachayer on the northern slopes notes the year that a bench was installed &quot;in the year 242, under Beeliabos, also called Diototos, son of Abedanos, high priest of the gods of Kiboreia&quot;. The era of the gods of Kiboreia is not certain, nor is their location, which is not conclusively to be identified with Deir al-Achayer, but was possibly the Roman sanctuary or the name of a settlement in the area.

===Religious importance in the Late Roman period===
Eusebius recognized the religious importance of Hermon in his work &quot;Onomasticon&quot; (probably written in the first quarter of the 4th century), saying &quot;Until today, the mount in front of Banias and Lebanon is known as Hermon and it is respected by nations as a sanctuary.&quot;

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification, the weather station at Mount Hermon features a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;). The climate might also more specifically be described as oro-Mediterranean (&quot;CsbH&quot;). Its temperature range is relatively narrow, while its yearly variation in precipitation is very wide; with mild, rainless summers, and chilly, very wet and often snowy winters.

The peak, at , has a Mediterranean-influenced warm-summer humid continental climate (Koppen: Dsb). 

==Arab-Israeli conflict==
===1967 Six-Day War===
During the Six-Day War in June 1967, a part of Mount Hermon in Syria was captured by Israel.

===1973 Yom Kippur War===
This part was regained by Syria on October 6, 1973, the first day of the Yom Kippur War, following the First Battle of Mount Hermon. After being repelled in the Second Battle of Mount Hermon, the IDF recaptured both the formerly Israeli-occupied sector and the pre-Yom Kippur War Syrian-controlled sector on October 21, 1973, during Operation Dessert, also known as the Third battle of Mount Hermon.
===1973-2024===
The pre-Yom Kippur War Syrian-controlled sector was returned to Syria after the war.

The Israeli-occupied sector of the mountain became patrolled by the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Police, and the Israeli Security Forces have maintained a strategic observation post for monitoring Syrian and Lebanese military activity near Mitzpe Shlagim (&quot;Snow Lookout&quot;), which is at an elevation of about . Its neighboring peak, at , is the highest elevation in Israeli-controlled territory, and is called &quot;Mitzpe Hashlagim&quot; by Israel.

===2024===

After the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria after the Syrian opposition offensives on December 8, 2024, Israeli forces took over the highest summit of Mount Hermon (Jabal El Sheikh outpost) on the same day.

==Ski resort==
Since 1981, when the Golan Heights Law was passed, the Israeli-occupied portion of the Golan Heights has been governed under Israeli law. Mount Hermon hosts the only ski resort in territory held by Israel, including a wide range of ski trails at novice, intermediate, and expert levels. It also offers additional winter family activities such as sledding and Nordic skiing. Those who operate the Hermon Ski area live in the nearby Israeli settlement of Neve Ativ and the Druze town of Majdal Shams. The ski resort has a ski school, ski patrol, and several restaurants located at either the bottom or peak of the area.

In 2005, the Syrian government had plans to develop a 15-billion-dollar ski resort on the slopes of the mountain.

<text>The Anti-Lebanon mountains () are a southwest–northeast-trending, c. long mountain range that forms most of the border between Syria and Lebanon. The border is largely defined along the crest of the range. Most of the range lies in Syria.

==Etymology==
Its Western name &quot;Anti-Lebanon&quot; comes from the Greek and Latin , derived from its position opposite (&quot;&quot;) and parallel to the Mount Lebanon range (). 

==Geology==
The Anti-Lebanon range is approximately in length. To the south, the range adjoins the lower-lying Golan Heights plateau, but includes the highest peaks, namely Mount Hermon (&quot;Jabal el-Shaykh&quot;, in Arabic), at 2,814 metres, and Ta&#x27;la&#x27;t Musa, at 2,669 metres. These peaks, on the Lebanese-Syrian border, are snow-covered for much of the year.

Anti-Lebanon mountains are an anticline. Their predominant rocks are limestone and chalk from the Jurassic period.

==Geography==
To the north, they extend to almost the latitude of the Syrian city of Homs. The mountains end in the south with Mount Hermon, which borders on the Golan Heights; the Golan Heights are a different geological and geomorphological entity, but geopolitically they are often regarded together with the southern slopes of Mount Hermon, both being Syrian territory occupied by Israel. To the west of the Anti-Lebanon lie valleys that separate it from Mount Lebanon in central Lebanon: Beqaa Valley in the north and the Hasbani River valley in the south. To the east, in Syria, lies the Eastern Plateau, location of the city of Damascus.

The mountains provide a rain shadow to the region on their east on their leeward side, such as the Syrian Desert.

An important smuggling route between Lebanon and Syria passes through the Anti-Lebanon mountains.

==Ecology==
The area is known for its apricot and cherry trees as well as its stone quarries. In the mountains, amygdalus and pistachio bushes thrive. On the west side are small-scale deciduous forests and isolated dry coniferous forests with Cilician firs (&quot;Abies cilicica&quot;), Lebanon cedars (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot;) and Greek juniper (&quot;Juniperus excelsa&quot;). Subalpine and alpine plant communities occur over 2,500 metres. The grazing by sheep and goats has led to increased erosion of the remaining forests and substantial deterioration of soil and vegetation. The predominant form of economy is extensive nomadic grazing.

There are various endemic flora found and named after the region (having a specific epithet that means &quot;of the Anti-Lebanon&quot;). These include &quot;Euphorbia antilibanotica&quot;, &quot;Teucrium antilibanoticum&quot;, &quot;Valerianella antilibanotica&quot;, and &quot;Iris antilibanotica&quot;.

<text>The Great Seal of the State of [[Kansas]] tells the history of the U.S. state of Kansas.

The seal contains:
* Landscape with a rising sun (the east)
* River and steamboat (commerce)
* Settler&#x27;s cabin and a man plowing a field (agriculture) [foreground]
* Wagon train heading west (American expansion / pioneer life)
* Indians hunting American Bison (the buffalo are fleeing from the Indians)
* Cluster of 34 stars (top of the seal) – identifying Kansas as the 34th state to be accepted into the Union of the United States.
* State motto &quot;&quot; (Latin: &quot;To the Stars through Difficulties&quot;)

The seal is used on the Flag of the State of Kansas.

==History==

The design for the Great Seal of Kansas was submitted by John James Ingalls, a state senator from Atchison. Ingalls also proposed the state motto, &quot;&quot;Ad astra per aspera&quot;.&quot;

The Great Seal of the State of Kansas was established by a joint resolution adopted by the Kansas Legislature on May 25, 1861.

The resolution states:
:&quot;The east is represented by a rising sun, in the right-hand corner of the seal; to the left of it, commerce is represented by a river and a steamboat; in the foreground, agriculture is represented as the basis of the future prosperity of the state, by a settler’s cabin and a man plowing with a pair of horses; beyond this is a train of ox-wagons, going west; in the background is seen a herd of buffalo, retreating, pursued by two Indians, on horseback; around the top is the motto, &#x27;Ad astra per aspera,&#x27; and beneath a cluster of thirty-four stars. The circle is surrounded by the words, &quot;Great seal of the state of Kansas. January 29, 1861.&quot;

<text>The Camunic language is an extinct language that was spoken in the 1st millennium BC in Val Camonica, a valley in the Central Alps. The language is sparsely attested to an extent that makes any classification attempt uncertain—even the discussion of whether it should be considered a pre–Indo-European or an Indo-European language has remained indecisive. Among several suggestions, it has been hypothesized that Camunic is related to the Raetic language from the Tyrsenian language family, or to the Celtic languages.

==Language==

The extant corpus is carved on rock. There are at least 170 known inscriptions, the majority of which are only a few words long. The writing system used is a variant of the north-Etruscan alphabet, known as the &quot;Camunian alphabet&quot; or &quot;alphabet of Sondrio&quot;. Longer inscriptions show that Camunic writing used boustrophedon.

Its name derives from the people of the Camunni, who lived during the Iron Age in Valcamonica and were the creators of many of the stone carvings in the area. Abecedariums found in Nadro and Piancogno have been dated to between 500 BC and 50 AD.

The amount of material is insufficient to fully decipher the language. Some scholars think it may be related to Raetic and to Etruscan, but it is considered premature to make such affiliation. Other scholars suggest that Camunic could be a Celtic or another unknown Indo-European language.

<text>The Skokomish (pronounced ) are one of nine tribes of the Twana, a Native American people of western Washington state in the United States. The tribe lives along Hood Canal, a fjord-like inlet on the west side of the Kitsap Peninsula and the Puget Sound basin. Historically the Twana were hunters, fishers, and gatherers who had a nomadic lifestyle during the warmer months, while living in more permanent homes during the winter months.

Today, Skokomish people are enrolled in the federally recognized Skokomish Indian Tribe.

Like many Northwest Coast indigenous peoples, the Skokomish rely heavily on fishing for their survival.

==Name==
The name &quot;Skokomish&quot; comes from the Twana &quot;sqʷuqʷóbəš&quot;, also spelled &quot;sqWuqWu&#x27;b3sH&quot;, and meaning &quot;river people&quot; or &quot;people of the river&quot;. The Skokomish were one of the largest of the nine different Twana village communities that existed before about 1860. By their locations, the nine groups were the Dabop, Quilcene (&quot;salt-water people&quot;), Dosewallips, Duckabush, Hoodsport, Skokomish (Skoko&#x27;bsh), Ctqwəlqweli (&quot;Vance Creek&quot;), Tahuya, and Duhlelap (Tule&#x27;lalap) communities. Within these nine communities there were at least 33 settlements.

==Language==
The Skokomish, or Twana language belongs to the Coast Salish family of indigenous languages.

==Reservation==
The tribe moved onto the Skokomish Indian Reservation in the central part of modern-day Mason County, Washington at the southeast base of the Olympic Peninsula around 1855. The reservation has a land area of 21.244 km2 (8.2022 sq mi) and a 2000 census resident population of 730 persons. Its major community is Skokomish. The nearest outside communities are Union, to its east, and Hoodsport, to its north.

<doc id="316443" wikidata="Q310462" url="?curid=316443" title="Saigō Takamori">
<text>was a Japanese samurai and nobleman. He was one of the most influential samurai in Japanese history and one of the three great nobles who led the Meiji Restoration. Living during the late Edo and early Meiji periods, he later led the Satsuma Rebellion against the Meiji government. Historian Ivan Morris described him as &quot;the quintessential hero of modern Japanese history&quot;.

==Early life==

Saigō Kokichi (西郷 小吉) was born in Kajiya, Kagoshima, Satsuma Domain, the eldest son of samurai squire (&quot;koshōkumi&quot;) Saigō Kichibē and his wife Masa. He had six siblings and his younger brother Ryūkō later became Marshal-Admiral Marquis Saigō Jūdō. His childhood name was Kokichi and he received the given name Takamori in adulthood. He wrote poetry under the name Saigō Nanshū (西郷 南洲).

Saigō was a low-ranking samurai, but his talent was recognized by Satsuma &quot;daimyō&quot; Shimazu Nariakira. However, in the political turbulence after Nariakira&#x27;s early death in 1857, Saigō was twice exiled to the remote southern islands of Satsuma, first to Amami Oshima and later to Okinoerabujima. He reconciled with regent Shimazu Hisamitsu in 1864, just in time to lead an army for the first time, successfully repelling an army from Chōshū during the Kinmon incident.

The enemies then buried the hatchet and joined forces in as the Satchō Alliance, which decisively defeated shogunate forces in the Second Chōshū expedition of 1866. Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigned, returning power to the Emperor in what came to be known as the Meiji Restoration. However, Saigō was one of the most vocal and vehement opponents to the negotiated solution, demanding that the Tokugawa be stripped of their lands and special status. His intransigence was one of the major causes of the subsequent Boshin War.

During the Boshin War, Saigō led the imperial forces at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi, and afterwards led the imperial army toward Edo, where he accepted the surrender of Edo Castle from Katsu Kaishū.

==Meiji bureaucrat==
Although Ōkubo Toshimichi and others were more active and influential in establishing the new Meiji government, Saigō retained a key role, and his cooperation was essential in the abolition of the han system and the establishment of a conscript army. In 1871 he was left in charge of the caretaker government during the absence of the Iwakura Mission (1871–73).

Saigō initially disagreed with the modernization of Japan and the opening of commerce with the West. He famously opposed the construction of a railway network, insisting that money should rather be spent on military modernization.

Saigō did insist that Japan should go to war with Korea in the Seikanron debate of 1873 due to Korea&#x27;s refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the Emperor Meiji as head of state of the Empire of Japan, and insulting treatment meted out to Japanese envoys attempting to establish trade and diplomatic relations. At one point, he offered to visit Korea in person and to provoke a &quot;casus belli&quot; by behaving in such an insulting manner that the Koreans would be forced to kill him. The other Japanese leaders strongly opposed these plans, partly from budgetary considerations, and partly from realization of the weakness of Japan compared with the western countries from what they had witnessed during the Iwakura Mission. Saigō resigned from all of his government positions in protest and returned to his hometown of Kagoshima.

==Satsuma Rebellion (1877)==

Shortly thereafter, a private military academy known as the Shi-gakkō was established in Kagoshima for the faithful &quot;samurai&quot; who had also resigned their posts to follow him from Tokyo. These disaffected samurai came to dominate the Kagoshima government, and fearing a rebellion, the government sent warships to Kagoshima to remove weapons from the Kagoshima arsenal. This provoked open conflict, although with the elimination of &quot;samurai&quot; rice stipends in 1877, tensions were already extremely high. Although greatly dismayed by the revolt, Saigō was reluctantly persuaded to lead the rebels against the central government.

The rebels fought two significant battles against the central government: the Siege of Kumamoto Castle and the Battle of Tabaruzaka. Saigō was initially confident of his ability to take Kumamoto Castle, but he had underestimated the effectiveness of the imperial conscripts defending the castle. After a failed assault, Saigō settled for a siege. Imperial reinforcements eventually forced their way through the rebel lines at the Battle of Tabaruzaka, ending the siege. The remnants of Saigō&#x27;s army retreated before the advancing imperials, who whittled it down relentlessly. Eventually Saigō and his final remaining samurai were encircled and annihilated at the Battle of Shiroyama. 

Saigō&#x27;s death brought the Satsuma Rebellion to an end.

==Death==

During the battle of Shiroyama, Saigō was badly injured in the hip. The exact manner of his death is unknown. There are no published reports by eyewitnesses. The accounts of his subordinates claim that he stood up and committed &quot;seppuku&quot; after his injury or that he requested that his friend Beppu Shinsuke assist his suicide. Three firsthand accounts of the condition of his deceased body exist. It is said that he was shot in the femur, then he thrust a sword into his stomach region, then was decapitated deliberately by a fellow citizen. All three accounts report that the body was decapitated. Two describe a bullet wound to the hip or thigh. As none of the eyewitness accounts mention a wound to the abdomen, or any fresh sword wound at all, it is unknown if Saigō pierced his stomach with his sword. Some scholars have suggested that neither is the case and that Saigō may have gone into shock following his wound, losing his ability to speak. Several samurai, upon seeing him in this state, would have severed his head, assisting him in the warrior&#x27;s suicide that they knew he would have wished for. Later, they would have said that he committed &quot;seppuku&quot; to preserve his status as a true &quot;samurai&quot;.

It is not clear what was done with Saigō&#x27;s head immediately after his death. Some legends say Saigō&#x27;s manservant hid the head, and it was later found by a government soldier. The head was somehow retrieved by government forces and was reunited with Saigō&#x27;s body, which was laid next to that of his deputies Kirino and Murata. This was witnessed by the American sea captain John Capen Hubbard. A myth persists that the head was never found.

==Legends==
Multiple legends sprang up concerning Saigō, many of which denied his death. It was believed by some that he had fled to Russia, or ascended to Mars. It was even recorded that his image appeared in a comet near the close of the 19th century, an ill omen to his enemies. Unable to overcome the affection that the people had for this paragon of traditional &quot;samurai&quot; virtues, the Meiji-era government pardoned him posthumously on February 22, 1889. The Japanese people appreciated the fact that he remained loyal to his virtues until his death in 1877.

==Artworks depicting Saigō==


Saigō famously refused to have his photograph taken, but his likeness is now highly visible in Tokyo.

A famous bronze statue of Saigō in hunting attire with his dog stands in Ueno Park, Tokyo. Made by Takamura Kōun, it was unveiled on December 18, 1898. Saigō met the noted British diplomat Ernest Satow in the 1860s, as recorded in the latter&#x27;s &quot;A Diplomat in Japan&quot;, and Satow was present at the unveiling as recorded in his diary.

A reproduction of the same statue stands on Okinoerabujima, where Saigō had been exiled.

A Japanese hand fan commemorating the event, which survives in the collection of the Staten Island Historical Society in New York, features a depiction of Saigō Takamori in a scene labeled (in English) &quot;The Battle Near the Citadel of Kumamoto&quot;.

<doc id="316445" wikidata="Q56397" url="?curid=316445" title="Chemakum language">
<text>Chemakum ( ; also written as Chimakum or Chimacum) is an extinct Chimakuan language once spoken by the Chemakum, a Native American group that once lived on western Washington state&#x27;s Olympic Peninsula. It was closely related to the Quileute language, also extinct but undergoing revitalization in the early 21st century. In the 1860s, Chief Seattle and the Suquamish people killed many of the Chimakum people. In 1890, Franz Boas found out about only three speakers, and they spoke it imperfectly, of whom he managed to gather linguistic data from one, a woman named Louise Webster (her brother was another speaker of the three). Several years later in the 1920s, Manuel J. Andrade cross-checked some of Boas&#x27; materials with the same speaker. A few semi-speakers continued until the 1940s on the east side of the Olympic Peninsula, between Port Townsend and Hood Canal.

The name &quot;Chemakum&quot; is an anglicization of the Salishan name for the Chimakum people, perhaps old Twana &quot;čə́mqəm&quot; (currently &quot;čə́bqəb&quot; ).

==Phonology==
Boas’ original article based on fieldwork with one of the last three native speakers in the summer of 1890 uses the following consonantal symbols: ‹h; k, ʞ, q; u; y; n; t; s, c, tç; ts, tc; m, p; l, lʻ; ′› along with ejectivization usually notated by a following ‹!› on stops and affricates, but sometimes also by a following ‹ߴ›. Labio-dorsals and the lateral ejective were analyzed as consonant clusters as the transcription shows. Based on his own description (in a footnote) and words and sentences cited, along with some comparison to Quileute cognates, the following phonemic inventory can be determined (the plain uvulars were probably pre-uvular and the plain stops and affricates were probably somewhat aspirated as in most languages of the region including Quileute):
Transcription isn&#x27;t fully standardized and some amount of variation is attested. E.g., some instances of ejectives are double-marked with both ‹!› and a following ‹ߴ›. Compare the independent word ‘back’ written ‹ʞ!ߴē′enōkoat› against the corresponding lexical suffix is written ‹-ʞ!ĕnuk›. Similarly, the lexical suffix for ‘hand’ appears as ‹-t!ߴa›. Here, the Quileute cognate ‹-t̓ay› shows that, despite the notation, the sound was probably just an ejective &quot;t&quot;. Yet another notation for an ejective – simply a following apostrophe – may be found in the word ‹ʞ!ߴautߴátct› ‘bracelet’ if this is indeed cognate to Quileute ‹ḳ̓aḳ̓ʷò·t̓á·yat› ‘bracelet’, and in ‹tcߴālʻa› ‘stone’, cognate to Quileute ‹k̓á·t̓ƚa› ‘stone’.

The labio-dorsals were not analyzed as unit consonants by Boas. The audible rounding on them was either marked as a glide, or the rounding was notationally transferred to a neighboring vowel. Consider the following examples: ‹kuē′lʻ› ‘one’ (Quileute ‹wí·ƚ›), ‹lʻa′kua› ‘two’ (Quileute ‹ƚáʔw›), ‹ʞoā′lē› ‘three’ (Quileute ‹ḳʷáʔl›), ‹-kō› ‘canoe (lexical suffix)’ (Quileute ‹-kʷ›), ‹-ʞōs› ‘neck (lexical suffix)’ (Quileute ‹-ḳ̓ʷó·s›), ‹-tçuʞ› ‘our’ (Quileute ‹-t̓oqʷ›) etc.

The meaning of Boas’ ‹tç› is not entirely certain. Swadesh, working with Boas’ data half a century later, decided to interpret ‹tç› as /t͡ʃʼ/ – in his notation ‹ч̓› – but it is not clear why, especially considering that /t͡ʃʼ/ is written differently in ‹tcߴālʻa› ‘stone’. Boas himself describes the sound as “dento-alveolar t”, which isn&#x27;t very helpful. Based on comparative evidence from Quileute, Powell interprets ‹tç› as a variant symbol for /t/ (perhaps notating some allophonic difference that Boas perceived).

Swadesh added a distinction between labio-velar and labio-uvular fricatives for which there is no explicit evidence in Boas’ paper yielding the system below:

Boas transcribed several distinct vowels in the published account of Chemakum (and a few more in his unpublished fieldnotes): ‹ā, a, ē, e, ĕ, ī, ō›, along with a marginal ‹u› whose main purpose was to indicate rounding adjacent to labio-dorsal consonants. The list was reduced to a much simpler phonemic inventory of three short vowels /i a o/ and three long vowels /iː aː oː/ by Powell. The vowels probably exhibited some amount of allophonic variation as Boas’ original transcription shows, but according to Andrade, less so than in Quileute.

<text>Póvoa de Varzim () is a Portuguese city in Northern Portugal and sub-region of Greater Porto, from its city centre. It sits in a sandy coastal plain, a cuspate foreland, halfway between the Minho and Douro rivers. In 2001, there were 63,470 inhabitants, with 42,396 living in the city proper. The city expanded southwards, to Vila do Conde, and there are about 100,000 inhabitants in the urban area alone. It is the seventh-largest urban agglomeration in Portugal and the third largest in Northern Portugal.

Permanent settlement in Póvoa de Varzim dates back to around four to six thousand years ago. Around 900 BC, unrest in the region led to the establishment of Cividade de Terroso, a fortified city, which developed maritime trade routes with the civilizations of classical antiquity. Modern Póvoa de Varzim emerged after the conquest by the Roman Republic of the city by 138 BC; fishing and fish processing units soon developed, which became the foundations of the local economy. By the 11th century, the fishing industry and fertile farmlands were the economic base of a feudal lordship and Varzim was fiercely disputed between the local overlords and the early Portuguese kings, which resulted in the establishment of the present day&#x27;s municipality in 1308 and being subjugated to monastic power some years later. Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s importance reemerged with the Age of Discovery due to its shipbuilders and merchants proficiency and wealth, who traded around the globe in complex trade routes. By the 17th century, the fish processing industry rebounded and, sometime later, Póvoa became the dominant fishing port in Northern Portugal.

Póvoa de Varzim has been a well-known beach resort for over three centuries, the most popular in Northern Portugal, which unfolded an influential literary culture and historical-artistic patronage in music and theater. Casino da Póvoa is one of the few and prominent gambling venues in Portugal. Leisure and health benefits provided in large sandy beaches attracts national and international visitors. Póvoa de Varzim holds other landmarks, especially the traditional Junqueira shopping street, Garrett Theatre, the Ethnography and History Museum, Cividade de Terroso, the Medieval Rates Monastery, Baroque Matriz Church, city Hall and Portuguese vernacular architecture in Praça do Almada, and numerous Portuguese cuisine restaurants that make Póvoa de Varzim popular in all Northern Portugal, which started to attract an international following. Farol da Lapa, Farol de Regufe, the main breakwater of the Port of Póvoa de Varzim, Carvalhido and São Félix Hill are preferred for sightseeing. The city has significant textile and food industries. The town has retained a distinct cultural identity and ancient Norse customs such as the writing system of siglas poveiras, the masseira farming technique and festivals.

==History==
===Castro Culture and Roman conquest===

Discoveries of Acheulean stone tools suggest Póvoa de Varzim has been inhabited since the Lower Palaeolithic, around 200,000 BC. The first groups of shepherds settled on the coast where Póvoa de Varzim is now located between the 4th millennium and early 2nd millennium BC. A Neolithic-Calcolithic necropolis, with seven known burial mounds, can still be seen around São Félix Hill and Cividade Hill.

Widespread pillaging by rival and migrant tribes led the resident populations of the coastal plain of Póvoa de Varzim to raise a town atop the hill that stood next to the sea. The acropolis protection was reinforced by successive rings of walls and a trench at the base of the hill. Established by the 9th or 8th century B.C., the city area covered and had several hundred inhabitants. Its location near waterways helped it to maintain commercial relations with the Mediterranean civilizations, especially noticeable during the Carthaginian dominion of the southern Iberian Peninsula.

During the Punic Wars, the Romans became aware of the Castro region&#x27;s rich deposits of gold and tin. Viriathus, leading Lusitanian troops, hindered the expansion of the Roman Republic north of the river Douro. His murder in 138 BC opened the way for the Roman legions. Over the following two years, Decimus Junius Brutus advanced into the Castro region from south of the Douro, crushed the Castro armies, and left Cividade de Terroso, in ruins.

The region was pacified during the reign of Caesar Augustus and the Castro people returned to the coastal plain, where Villa Euracini and Roman fish factories were built. With the annexation by the Roman Republic, trading supported regional economic development, with Roman merchants organized in true commercial companies who looked for monopoly in commercial relations.

===Feudalism and municipalism===

With the fall of the Roman Empire, Suebi populations established themselves in the countryside. It was first mentioned on 26 March 953 during the rule of Mumadona Dias, Countess of Portugal. The region was attacked by the Vikings in the 960s, by the Moors in 997 and again by Norman pirates in 1015–1016. Hints indicate a Norse settlement in Villa Euracini after those invasions. During the Middle Ages, the name &quot;Euracini&quot; evolved to &quot;Uracini&quot;, &quot;Vracini&quot;, &quot;Veracini&quot;, &quot;Verazini&quot;, &quot;Verazim&quot;, &quot;Varazim&quot; and, eventually, Varzim.

In 1033, Guterre Pelayo, a leading captain of the Reconquista for the County of Portugal, was recognized by Bermudo, Emperor in Gallaecia, as the Lord of Varzim, during the chaotic epoch following Almanzor&#x27;s attack on the Christian realms. Henry, the Portuguese count, recognized his rule over the port of Varzim amongst several other possessions. Varzim overlords gained significant power and, when Portugal was already a stable kingdom, Sancho I of Portugal attacked the fief and seized the port, destroyed most of the properties and expelled the farmers. The northern area became known as &quot;Varzim dos Cavaleiros&quot; (Knights&#x27; Varzim) and belonged to the military order of the Knights Hospitaller, who inherited the wealth of the local overlords. Lower Varzim, the royal southern land, was the location of the port and contiguous farmlands.

According to a 1258 chronic, while Sancho II of Portugal was disputing the throne with his brother, Afonso, who was invited by the knights to take over the Portuguese throne, Gavião of Varzim used the opportunity to destroy the king&#x27;s assets in Lower Varzim. He violently entered in the king&#x27;s lands, destroyed it significantly, in such a way that no bread could be sowed, nor a car could cross that place as it often used to do. Sancho II was overthrown, Afonso became king and ordered the resettlement of the royal land and the king&#x27;s chronicler explicitly stated that all the port was the property of the king.

Gomes Lourenço, of the Honour of Varzim, was a very influential knight and godfather of King Denis. He took advantage of his relationship with important people in the kingdom in order to get the recognition of the seaport, located in Lower Varzim, as his honour. He tried to convince King Denis, that the king&#x27;s father, Afonso, took it from him unfairly. Justifying the attitude with the Honour of Varzim, Gomes and his descendants went to the port to get the tribute from the fishermen.

In 1308, King Denis granted a charter, the &quot;Foral&quot;, giving the royal land to 54 families of Varzim; these had to found a municipality known as &quot;Póvoa&quot; around Praça Velha, siding Varzim Old Town, controlled by the knights. In 1312, King Denis donated Póvoa to his bastard son, Afonso Sanches, Lord of Albuquerque, who included it in the patrimony of the Monastery of Santa Clara, which he had just founded in Vila do Conde. In 1367, King Ferdinand I confirmed the charters, privileges and uses of Póvoa de Varzim. These were again confirmed by John I in 1387. But the domain of the monastery over the town grew stronger and the people asked King Manuel I to end the situation. In 1514, during the era of charter reform, the King granted a new charter to Póvoa de Varzim. Besides the town hall and square, the town gained a pillory, granted significant self-government, and involved itself in the Portuguese discoveries.

===Shipbuilders, seafarers and fishermen===

In the 16th century, the fishermen started to work in maritime activities, as pilots or seafarers in the crew of the Portuguese ships, due to their high nautical knowledge. The fishermen of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since at least 1506. During the reign of John III the Povoan shipmaking art was already renowned, and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon&#x27;s Ribeira das Naus shipyard due to their high technical skills. The single-floored houses dominated the town&#x27;s landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture. The seafarers&#x27; social class, well-off gentlemen, was associated with this richer architecture around Praça Velha square.
In the 17th century, the shipbuilding industry boomed in Ribeira, area around Póvoa Fortress in the sheltered bay, and one third of the population had some relation with this activity, building ships for the merchant navigation. During this period there was a relevant urban expansion: the Praça civic center with the town hall and the Madre Deus Chapel, the area of the old town where the Main church was located and the fishermen neighborhood of Junqueira was starting its affirmation as a new urban center.

In the beginning of the 18th century, there was a decline in the Ribeira shipyard activities, due to the aggradation of the Portuguese coast and the Povoan shipyard started to work in the construction of fishing vessels. There was a significant increase of the fisher community in the middle of the century, becoming the main activity, and during the reign of Joseph I with the country in the middle of an economic crisis, Póvoa started a rapid development. The Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon noticed their overwhelming notoriety in the Minho coast and considered Povoans to be the most expert fishermen from Cape St. Vincent to Caminha, with a sizable number of fishermen, ships and high sea fishing. The result was a very considerable quantity of caught fish.

The community became wealthier and, following a royal provision by Queen Mary I in 1791, the inspector general Almada reorganized the town&#x27;s layout, a new civic centre with a monumental city hall, streets and infrastructure were built, all of which provided the potential for a new business — sea baths.

===The Baths of Póvoa and the modern city===
Since 1725, the iodine-rich seawaters of Póvoa, due to the peculiar high quantities of seaweed that ends up in Póvoa beaches from the sheltered bay to Cape Santo André, brought by ocean currents, lead that Benedictine monks choose to take sea-baths in there, searching cures for skin and bone problems. Still in the 18th century, other people went to Póvoa with the same concerns. In the 19th century, the town became popular as a summer destination for the wealthy of Entre-Douro-e-Minho province and Portuguese Brazilians, due to its large sandy beaches and the development of theaters, hotels and casinos. It then became renowned for its refined literary culture, artistic patronage in music and theater, and intellectual tertulia.
On 27 February 1892, a shipwreck had critical impact in community. Seven lanchas poveiras wrecked in a storm and 105 fishermen were killed, just metres off the shore. Over-fishing by steamboats created severe social problems and fishermen emigration. The fishing industry lost much of its importance. Meanwhile, Póvoa developed into the most popular holiday destination in northern Portugal, The textile and food industries thrived. Streetcars appeared in 1874 and endured until September 1934. The rail connection to Porto opened in 1875 and to inland Minho region in 1878. National highways linking the city to Barcelos, Famalicão and Viana do Castelo opened. The first urbanization project for the waterfront was drafted in 1891. All these events led to a major growth between the 1930s and 1960s.

Póvoa de Varzim developed a cosmopolitan style and became a service-sector city. It is one of northern Portugal&#x27;s main urban centres. Póvoa is the focal point of a larger area, which includes Vila do Conde and Esposende.

==Geography==

Occupying an area of , Póvoa de Varzim lies between the Cávado and Ave rivers, or, from a wider perspective, halfway between the Minho and Douro rivers on the northern coast of Portugal — the Costa Verde. It is bordered to the north by the municipality of Esposende, to the northeast by Barcelos, to the east by Vila Nova de Famalicão, and to the south by Vila do Conde. To the west, it has a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean.
The rocky cliffs, common features downstream of the Minho&#x27;s estuary, disappear in Póvoa de Varzim, giving way to a coastal plain. The plain is located in a cuspate foreland, an old marine plateau from the Plio-Pleistocene, conferring a sandy soil to the coastal lands. The sand dunes in the Northwestern coast formed during the Little Ice Age and started piling up in the 15th or 16th century. Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André, the tip of the cuspate foreland and the &quot;Avarus Promontory&quot;, referred to by Ptolemy.

São Félix Hill () and Cividade Hill () rise above the landscape. Despite their modest rise, the expanse of the plain makes them easy reference points on the horizon. The mountain chain known as Serra de Rates divides the municipality into two distinctive areas: the coastal plain and hills where the forests become more abundant and the soils have less sea influence. In this landscape dominated by the plains and low hills, only the hillside of Corga da Soalheira () in the interior, is dissimilar.

There are no large rivers, but abundant small water streams exist. Some of these streams are permanent, such as the Este River, which feeds into the Ave. The source of the Esteiro Stream is located at the base of Cividade Hill and empties at the beach of Aver-o-Mar, while the Alto River&#x27;s source is at the base of São Félix and reaches the Atlantic at Rio Alto Beach. The land is well-irrigated, springs and wells are very common since underground water is often close to the surface.

The forest areas suffer from strong demographic pressure and intensive agriculture. Some forests locally known as &quot;bouças&quot; are defined areas with maritime pines, oaks and eucalyptus plantations. Forests are still important in parishes surrounded by the Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the pedunculate oak or the european holly. In the 18th century, the monks of Tibães planted pines, which characterized the civil parish of Estela. In the past the Atlantic forest predominated, with trees such as oaks, ash trees, hazels, strawberry trees, holm oak, and alders.

The granitic gneiss rocks throughout the entire coastline are home to large populations of invertebrates, fish and seaweed. These gneiss and the dunes form rich ecosystems, but are threatened by waterfront construction, holiday-makers and dune sports.

Short-beaked common dolphins occur in large numbers in Northern Portugal. Dolphins show themselves by porpoising and bowriding along with boats just off the city of Póvoa de Varzim, where fishing activities occur. Alive or dead discarded fish while fishing can be easily caught by dolphins, which could help explain this relationship in the city&#x27;s waters. The OMARE Marine Observatory also identified the Risso&#x27;s dolphin and the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin in local waters. Stranded whales and dolphins and found dead occur with some frequency, natural causes, rough seas events, incidents with ships or fishing boats can explain these events.

The city core is situated in a region dominated by old Hercynian granites, including Póvoa de Varzim Granite and Santo André Granite. A continuous area dominated by schist exists to the Northeast and vernacular architecture of the rural areas highlight the local geological diversity. Oldest rocks, from the Pre-Ordovician epoch, are found in the Schist-greywacke Complex between Rates, Laundos, and Estela. Wandering even further Northeast, there is shale of micaceous clay nature, occasionally quartzite, dating to the Devonian period, that may contain fossils.

===Climate===

Póvoa&#x27;s climate is classified as a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification system), with gentle summers and mild winters, influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Temperature extremes recorded at Sá Carneiro Airport, records started in 1967, range from . In Póvoa de Varzim proper, average temperatures oscillate between in winter and in the summer. The city&#x27;s beach area averages between and diurnal temperature variation there is very low, just . The remaining territory, including the northwestern rural beaches, swings around daily. Using 1971–2000 data, there are 33 days a year above and 9 days above . Heat waves can occur for an average of 10 days, yet it tends to be balmier than inland Northwestern Portugal, and it is used by inland Minho Province residents seeking to escape the summer heat in the valleys. The so-called &quot;tropical nights&quot; with minimum temperature above occur three days per year.

There are no full-days below freezing, yet temperatures below can occur at the height of winter during the night and early morning. The city possesses a microclimate and is considered the region least subject to frosts in all northern Portugal. Cold waves are absent and snowfall is firmly uncommon, the last occurred in January 1986. More recently, snowfall occurred inland. This is due to the winter maritime winds that normally blow from the south and southwest. Most of the rain is concentrated in the winter months, due to the Azores High which influences the subsidence of the air resulting in dry air during the summer. Topography and distance from the sea influence precipitation even at short distances. The urban core receives over , the outskirts can get up to of rain per year, while the city&#x27;s countryside can get up to .

The prevailing northern winds, known as &quot;Nortadas&quot;, arise in the summer after midday. Strongest wind gusts are felt in the city&#x27;s sands and only reaching inland in municipalities south of Póvoa de Varzim. During the summer, a mass of hot and wet air, brought by the south and western maritime winds, creates Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s characteristic fog covering only the coast and with strong ocean scent brought in by the marine layer, which is composed of salt from the surf and sea spray, with lesser amounts of iodine from the outlying kelp forests. Southerly winds can sporadically bring the Saharan Air Layer and Saharan dust can form a thick plume blocking the sun.

Sunshine duration values are high, between April and September the mean is always over 217 hours, peaking in July with 308 hours. The gloomiest months are December and January with 124 hours each (1961–1990 data). Solar irradiance is high in the city&#x27;s beaches, and lower inland and on the northwestern coast.

==Demographics==
A native of Póvoa de Varzim is called a &quot;Poveiro&quot; which can be rendered into English as Povoan. According to the 2001 Census, there were 63,470 inhabitants that year, 38 848 (61.2%) of whom lived in the city. The number goes up to 100,000 if adjacent satellite areas are taken into account, ranking it as the seventh largest independent urban area in Portugal, within a polycentric agglomeration of about 3 million people, ranging from Braga to Porto. According to the EOCD methology, Póvoa de Varzim was the 13th largest Functional urban area of Portugal, hence a small urban area with 63,428 inhabitants, by including only its municipality.

The urban area has a population density of , while the rural and suburban areas have a density of . The rural areas away from the city tend to be scarcely populated, becoming denser near it. During the summer the resident population in the city triples; this seasonal movement from neighbouring cities is due to the draw of the beach and 29.9% of homes had seasonal use in 2001, the highest in Greater Porto. Póvoa de Varzim is the youngest city in the region with a birth rate of 13.665 and mortality rate of 8.330. Unlike other urban areas of greater Porto, it is not a satellite city. Significant commuting occurs only with Vila do Conde, an urban expansion area of Póvoa since the 18th century.
For centuries a fishing community of mostly Norman origin, where ethnic isolationism was a common practice, Póvoa de Varzim is today a cosmopolitan town, with people originating from the Ave Valley who settled in the coastal Northern districts during the 20th century, the ancient immigration from Galicia, Portuguese-Africans (who arrived in significant numbers after the independence of Angola and Mozambique) in the late 1970s. In 2017, Póvoa de Varzim had a legal foreign resident population of 1.5%, up from 1.4% in 2008, mostly including economic migrants and expatriates, it excludes those who obtained Portuguese citizenship and illegal migrants. Most of these were from Brazil, China, Ukraine, France, Spain, Mozambique, Angola, Romania, the United Kingdom and Cape Verde. Most of the growth in foreign population arrived from China, other Asian countries, France and other European countries. In 2017, 231 migrants moved to Póvoa de Varzim from Brazil, Ukraine and Venezuela; but also from Uzbekistan, Angola, and Georgia. Indonesian fishermen have been contracted to work in Póvoa de Varzim to redress labour shortages. Their arrival was negotiated directly with the Indonesian diplomatic authorities. Their numbers have grown to over 400, though some have moved on to other areas and even other European countries.

The population of the entire municipality grew only 1% between 1981 and 1991, then increased by 15.3% between 1991 and 2001. During that period, the urban population had grown 23%, with the number of families increasing considerably — by about 44.5%. The urban area kept a slower but steady growth in the 21st century, and in the 2021 Census it was one of the few urban areas to expand in the whole of Portugal. The quality of living, the infrastructure development and a 15 minutes distance from Porto and Braga, prompted new residents originating from near-by cities such as Guimarães, Famalicão, Braga and Porto. The beach areas of Póvoa de Varzim is also popular for a new home by foreign nationals, mostly French and Swiss.

Due to the practice of endogamy and the caste system, Póvoa&#x27;s fishing community maintained local ethnic characteristics. Anthropological and cultural data indicate Nordic fishermen settling during the period of the coast&#x27;s resettlement. In &quot;As Praias de Portugal&quot; (Beaches of Portugal, 1876), Ramalho ortigão wrote that the Povoan fishermen were a &quot;race&quot; in the Portuguese coast; entirely different from the Mediterranean type of Ovar and Olhão, Poveiro is of &quot;Saxon&quot; type. On the other hand, the man from the interior was a farmer with Galician character (Paleo and Nordid-Atlantid). In a 1908 research, anthropologist Fonseca Cardoso considered that &quot;Poveiros&quot; were the result of a mixture of Teutons, Jews and mostly, Normans. In the book &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1938), &quot;Poveiros&quot; were distinguished by having a greater than usual degree of blondism, broad faces of unknown origin, and broad jaws.

&quot;Poveiros&quot; have migrated to other places and this attenuated the population growth. One should notice that the &quot;Poveiros&quot; tended to create their own associations abroad, there are Casa dos Poveiros (Poveiros House) in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo), Germiston in South Africa and Toronto in Canada. In Rio de Janeiro, the community was known for not wanting other peoples of other origins, including Portuguese born in other regions, within their community. In 1920, many Poveiros emigrated in Brazil returned, as many refused to lose Portuguese nationality. The governor of Angola, with an ambition to develop fisheries, suggested the creation of a Povoan colony in Porto Alexandre. Due to fisher classes affairs, the fisher areas of Vila do Conde, Esposende and Matosinhos have strong Povoan cultural influence and half of the population of Vila do Conde and Matosinhos are of Povoan descent.

==Economy==
The economy of Póvoa de Varzim is driven by sales, manufacturing, construction, healthcare, agribusiness, fishing, and tourism. In the 2021 census, the unemployment rate, at 8.3%, compared to Porto Metropolitan Area at 9.6%, Northern Portugal at 8.4% and the national average at 8.1%. Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s purchasing power represented 0.6% of the total national purchasing power in 2019, up from 0.5% in 1993. However, per capita values were just 96.5% of the national average in 2019, up from 90.6% in 1993.

Comparing 2009 to 2020, the diversified economy of Póvoa de Varzim drifted away from construction (-70.3%), administrative (-55.6%), Entertainment
&amp; leisure (-44.1%), and professional services (-22.9%) towards the growing fields of real estate (+73.5%), industrial sector (+47.3%), sales (+43.4%), Agribusiness &amp; Fisheries (+41%), Healthcare (+31.9%) and Hospitality (+9.2%). quaternary sector (+41%) and Transport (+9.4%) are comparably minor yet growing economic activities.

Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s real estate development ranked as the fifth most active out of seventeen municipalities of Metropolitan Porto in 2015, when considering new homes. Reconstruction was mostly stagnant, and Póvoa de Varzim was eighth in overall activity.

===Fisheries===
The fact that it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s economy: the fishing industry, from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city&#x27;s fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa&#x27;s economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels&#x27; capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. &quot;A Poveira&quot; is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D&#x27;Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.

Marine fish farming started in 1994 by SafiEstela, an aquafarming firm established in 1968. It uses the latest knowledge on the breeding and production of high-valued seafood species, including soles, with intricate fish husbandry. It was part of the European Maximus consortium of 8 SME and 6 RTD performers involving states in Atlantic Europe, with innovative scientific processes in a number of interrelated disciplines, including growth physiology, quality, fish welfare and stunning methods.

===Agribusiness===
Production is still specialized in horticultural goods, but most of the were substituted by greenhouses and a significant share of the production is exported to other Western European markets. Póvoa de Varzim is part of the ancient Vinho Verde winemaking region, and there is commercial wine production, however, local masseira wines are not commercially produced. The inland valley region is committed to milk production and the Agros corporation headquarters of Lactogal, the largest dairy products and milk producer company in the Iberian Peninsula, is located in Espaço Agros and has several departments such as exhibition park and laboratories. In agriculture, the masseira farm fields were developed. This technique increases agricultural yields by using large, rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes, with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression. Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south, east and west, and trees and reeds on the northern slope act as a windbreak against the prevailing northern wind. Garden crops are grown in the central depression.

===Tourism===
Tourism industry is subdivided into gambling, hospitality, restaurants, beach bars and cafés. National visitors are prevalent and from diverse localities. In 1876, Ramalho Ortigão noticed that Póvoa was very popular in all social ranks in Northern Portugal.

In the contemporary period, the construction of motorways negatively affected overnight stays in local hotels. This has been leveled by a noticeable attraction of Portuguese living abroad and foreign tourists and the number of hotel rooms in 2014 increased to 1.774. Most of those tourists are French or from diverse countries in Northern Europe. International tourists sleeping in the city&#x27;s hotels represented 35.1% of guests in 2013, up from 30.3% in 2001. In 2017, international tourists represented 55% of guests in the hospitality industry, which registed 250 thousand overnight stays almost the double of the 2012 statistics. Informal local accommodation, especially typical homes in rua Latino Coelho, is a popular alternative. In the summer of 2017, Póvoa de Varzim was the second location with the largest growth in the Portuguese AirBNB hospitality service. Póvoa de Varzim has the longest overnight stays for foreign tourists in Metropolitan Porto who stay, on average, 3 days.

International awareness is increasing and Povoa de Varzim was considered a 2022 hotspot for family vacations in Portugal by Yahoo! UK and Prima magazine, along with Lisbon, Albufeira, Porto, Carvoeiro and Viana do Castelo, highlighting the seven miles of soft golden sands and the historical side of the city, namely the important fishing and shipbuilding legacy. National and foreign visitors search the town for the numerous sandy beaches, sunbathing, sunsets over the ocean, relaxation and city trips. Walking from the beach promenades to the old town shopping street, the &quot;Junqueira&quot;, is particularly enjoyed, as is local food, most especially seafood. Since 1970, Póvoa de Varzim became widely popular in Northern Portugal for restaurants specialized in Portuguese Piri Piri Chicken, Cabidela chicken blood rice or codfish. Due to tourism, affluent pensioners from the Western World living in Póvoa de Varzim increased, triggering fears of renewed gentrification, the city hall responded with the planned construction of apartments with controlled prices for young Povoans in Penalves area.

Reducing seasonality in tourism demand has been a city&#x27;s goal, throw the development of sports and cultural tourism, this helped to decline the seasonality from 48.4% in 2001 to 44.9% in 2013.

===Manufacturing===
There are some industrial areas, including &quot;Zona Industrial de Amorim&quot; and &quot;Parque Industrial de Laundos&quot;, in the city&#x27;s outskirts, next to the A28 Motorway. Póvoa de Varzim has been noted internationally for its Renewable energy industry. The world&#x27;s first commercial wave farm was located in its coast, at the Aguçadora Wave Park. The wave farm used Pelamis P-750 machines. The project failed and was replaced by the windfloat project, a new prototype on offshore wind farms, from a distinct company, that attained successful testing. Energie, a company headquartered in Póvoa de Varzim, developed a thermodynamic solar system combining solar energy and a heat pump to generate energy.

The manufacturing industry is an important employer, mostly in the textile industry. One of its traditional and high-end products are the Tapetes Beiriz, a handmade rug produced since 1918, which currently also produces contemporary rugs. The clothing industry balanced back from European Union&#x27;s expansion to Eastern Europe and Globalization, by shifting to luxury clothing for high fashion brands or reinventing uniforms, with specific needs or complexity, as seen in the case of Damel. In construction and civil engineering, Monte Adriano is a large Portuguese company.

==Government==

Póvoa de Varzim is governed by a &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot; (City Council) composed of nine councilmen. A Municipal Assembly exists and it is the legislative body of the municipality.

After the first free elections, with the end of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; period, only right-wing parties have governed the city: the city council was governed by the CDS between 1976 and 1989 and since then by the PSD. The CDS saw its popularity suffer an abrupt decline in 1997. On the other hand, the PSD in the same year achieved its first absolute majority with 62.4% of the votes. After the 2021 municipal elections, seven councilmen were members of the centre-right &quot;Partido Social Democrata&quot; (PSD), and two of the centre-left &quot;Partido Socialista&quot; (PS). The mayor is Aires Pereira, for the PSD, elected with 51.7% of the votes. However, turnout was below 50%, at 48.1%. The PSD holds the majority of public offices both in the Municipal Assembly and in the administrative parishes. Póvoa de Varzim Assembly is singly elected and comprises 27 members, with the PSD holding 15 seats — 48.60%, the PS 7 seats — 22,02%, &quot;Chega&quot; 1 seat — 6.04%, &quot;CDU&quot; 1 seat — 4.33%, &quot;CDS&quot; 1 seat — 4,04%, &quot;Liberals&quot; 1 seat — 3.54%, and the Left Bloc 1 seat — 3.01%.

Póvoa de Varzim is the northernmost municipality in the Porto Metropolitan Area, about north of Porto. However, it is not a Porto&#x27;s Commuter town. Póvoa de Varzim also used to be part of the former Association of Municipalities of the Ave Valley, along with neighbouring cities such as Vila do Conde, Guimarães, and Famalicão, with which it has the most important modern demographic links.

Since the establishment of the County of Portugal around 1095, Varzim was an administrative and military unit that stretched from the sea to Cividade de Terroso and São Félix Hills. Póvoa de Varzim was established as a municipality in 1308 with the election of a town hall judge and boundary exemption. As the town achieved broad self-government in the 16th century, restricted borders were created, which split the town itself and since disputed by the town hall. Over time, these were expanded to approach the medieval lordship boundaries. However, Caxinas and Poça da Barca, south expansion areas of Póvoa de Varzim in the 18th and 19th centuries with fisher populations from Póvoa, are administrated by Vila do Conde, in spite of the centuries-old requests of Póvoa de Varzim for these to be incorporated in its municipality. Inland, the parishes of Rio Mau, Touginhó, and Arcos are also historically disputed.

The origin of the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown, but it certainly has local traits and symbolism. The coat of arms consists of a golden sun and a silver moon; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms, representing safety at sea. Over the cross, a ring, of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms, representing faith and divine protection. The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status. The flag is broken in blue and white. Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted of a golden shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag was plain red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.

==Cityscape==


===Urban morphology===
Located in the coastal plain between the sea and hills, the city of Póvoa de Varzim has eleven &quot;Partes&quot; (parts), or districts. These districts are, in turn, part of two formal administrative structures known as &quot;freguesias&quot; (civil parishes): U.F. Póvoa de Varzim, Beiriz e Argivai and U.F. Aver-o-Mar, Amorim e Terroso. To the south, the city is extending out to combine with Vila do Conde.


The city started from an inland town that extended to the coast. The Bairro da Matriz, whose nucleus was the centre from whence the city grew, is intersected by 14th century narrow and twisted streets lined by single-family homes. The historical district has old buildings such as the sixteenth-century house in front of Matriz Church — the main church, the old Town Hall (14th century), the seventeenth-century Solar dos Carneiros and the house of Captain Leite Ferreira, and the eighteenth century Limas and the Coentrão Houses. The fishermen were grouped in the south coast, around Póvoa Cove (&quot;Enseada da Póvoa&quot;); The fisher district was already developed in the 18th century with its structure of narrow streets parallel to the coast.

Póvoa de Varzim City Centre or &quot;Centro&quot; is dominated by the service sector and by the shopping streets of Junqueira and Mousinho de Albuquerque Avenue. Praça do Almada, the central square, is tipped by City Hall, municipal departments, banks and other services. In the middle of the square, to the west, the Manueline pillory of Póvoa de Varzim stands. The &quot;Pelourinho&quot;, granted to the town in 1514, is a national monument representing the municipal emancipation of Póvoa de Varzim.

Bairro Norte, the beach district, is north of town and is densely occupied. Continuous to this area, the Agro-Velho beach district, mostly known as Nova Póvoa, is the area of the city with most high-rises, the largest of which the &quot;Nova Póvoa&quot;, with 30 floors and high, complete in 1979, was the tallest building in Portugal until the year 2000 and is still today one of the five tallest buildings. Close at hand, Barreiros and Parque da Cidade are districts from the latest expansion.

Inland, Giesteira, derived from the old village of Giesteira that, with Argivai, formed the main nucleus of the settlement before the 14th century, and whose &quot;lavradores&quot; (farmers) set up &quot;Póvoa&quot; in the coast. Argivai is divided by the Santa Clara Aqueduct, the second-largest aqueduct in Portugal, construction started in 1626. The old areas of Mariadeira, Regufe, Penalves, and Gândara have modest development, possess different topologies and are residential with small central areas. The Regufe Quarter has as symbol the Regufe Lighthouse, a sample from the 19th century iron art. Aver-o-mar is the northernmost urban coastal district and also of residential nature, with the exception of Santo André also known as Quião, which keeps an untouched fishing character recognized by family homes that have grown up in a spontaneous way.

Of the diverse religious buildings the 18th-century Baroque churches are prominent: the Parish Church, the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows and its six chapels, and the fishermen Lapa Church, with its curious Lapa Lighthouse. On the other hand, Misericórdia Church and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus denote the preference for the Neoclassical style at the end of the 19th century. The Romanesque revival style can be seen in São José de Ribamar.

===Beaches and parks===

Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s beach is a stretch of golden sands, forming sheltered bays and divided by rocks. Most beaches in the city are family-oriented such as Redonda, Salgueira or Lagoa Beach and during the summer period it can get crowded while those away from the city core, such as Santo André, are less crowded. Salgueira and Aguçadoura are surfing beaches. Located near a camping park, Rio Alto Beach is chosen by naturists given its difficult access and the privacy offered by the sand dunes.
The most important and popular green space is Póvoa de Varzim City Park, an urban park hosting leisure activities. It is almost entirely landscaped including hills, a large island, a lake, ponds and a stream. The city park and other minor parks in Póvoa de Varzim were designed by Sidónio Pardal, a well-known Portuguese landscape architect. It also includes great lawn areas, rustic buildings, amphitheatres and playground structures. It is a popular place for jogging, cycling and birdwatching. It stretches from the A28 motorway to Pedreira Lake.

Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s most relevant garden squares are Praça do Almada (19th century) and Praça Luiz de Camões (20th century). Near the A28 motorway, there are three small parks: Espaço Agros, Argivai Picnic Park (&quot;Parque de Merendas de Argivai&quot;), and Travessa de Calves Green Space. Espaço Agros is a private-sponsored park with 22 hectare in the former Anjo woodland. This woodland was damaged by the construction of high speed roads in the beginning of the 1990s. Agros kept the essential rural setting, with some landscaping and environmental improvements, including a small lake. This is also the location of the city-owned Picnic Park, used for Easter Monday picnics.

The Primary Dune System of Póvoa de Varzim, on the Northwestern coast, stretches for more than . Best preserved in Northern Aguçadoura&#x27;s Dune Park where a boardwalk exists between the primary dune and the grey dune. Boardwalks exist in considerable lengths of the coastline. The Port of Póvoa de Varzim is a semi-natural open space, popular in the weekend or the summer months. Cividade de Terroso is an archeological site surrounded by lush green areas and, on the hilltop, exclusively with native flora, as proven by archeological research. São Félix Hill (&quot;Monte São Félix&quot;), with panoramic views over the city and the countryside, is a religious and forested hill with a gardened stairway. The outer suburbs include Parque da Estela and Rates Park. The later is an adventure-camp with sport activities, canopy walkways, ecotourism by foot, horse, all-terrain vehicles or mountain biking.

===Countryside===
The green belt of Póvoa de Varzim includes a web of 98 localities in the parishes of Aguçadoura, Amorim, Balazar, Beiriz, Estela, Laundos, Navais, Rates, and Terroso. São Pedro de Rates, Codixeira, Aldeia, Pedreira, Fontainhas, Areosa, Teso, and Santo André de Baixo are the main rural communities, but there are tiny villages, such as Além, Calves, Gestrins, Gresufes, Passô, Sejães, and Crasto.

Terroso, Amorim and Beiriz are located in the urban hinterland. Beiriz has the notorious Beiriz carpets and diverse old country estates such as villas and a &quot;tapada&quot;, a hunting park, while Amorim is known for the bread eaten at high temperatures just after being made — the &quot;Broa de Amorim&quot;. The hills of Póvoa de Varzim: Cividade and São Félix are located in Terroso and Laúndos, respectively. On the first hill, there is Cividade de Terroso, with 3 thousand years was one of the major Castro culture cities, and the eremite Saint Félix is thought to have lived on the second hill during the Middle Ages.
Rates was a small town during the Middle Ages which developed around the monastery established by Count Henry in 1100 on the site of an older temple and gained importance due to the legend of Saint Peter of Rates, the first bishop of Braga, becoming a central site in the Portuguese way of Saint James. Of the millenarian monastery, the São Pedro de Rates Church remains and is one of the oldest and best preserved Romanesque monuments in Portugal and is classified as national monument since 1910. Bordering Rates, Balazar became a Christian pilgrimage destination in the 20th century due to Alexandrina Maria da Costa, died 1955, who gained fame as a Saint, beatified by Pope John Paul II.

The northern sandy land of the municipality, Aguçadoura, Navais, and Estela is the farming area of Póvoa de Varzim, supplying the European markets with horticultural goods. In old times, the population attributed legends, magical virtues or therapeutic effects to several springs. In Navais, there is the very ancient Moura Encontada Fountain, associated with Moura — a feminine water deity and guardian of enchanted treasures.

==Culture and contemporary life==
Junqueira is Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s busiest shopping district, that cater to both the daily needs of residents and visitors. The main street, a shopping street since the 18th century, is a pedestrian area since 1955, one of the earliest in Portugal, and a model for other Portuguese cities that later did similar developments. It has about of pedestrian streets. Dotted with boutiques in old traditional buildings, Junqueira is renowned for its jewellery, with &quot;Ourivesaria Gomes&quot; was the goldsmith, The most notable of its goldsmiths is Ourivesaria Gomes, where, during the Estado Novo, important people of the regime were often seen with their families. Open for more than 100 years, Ourivesaria Gomes was the goldsmithery of the Portuguese Royal House, and it had kings, nobility and the clergy as customers. The bullet used for the assassination attempt of Pope John Paul II was encrusted in the crown of Our Lady of Fatima by them.

People in Póvoa de Varzim observe a variety of festivals each year. The major celebration is Póvoa de Varzim Holiday, dedicated to Saint Peter. Neighbourhoods are decorated and, on the night of 28 to 29 June, the population gathers in the streets and neighbourhoods compete in the &quot;rusgas&quot; carnival. The population behaves much like football supporters, when defending their preferred quarter. Families who emigrated to the United States and beyond, have been known to come back to Póvoa, time and again, simply to relish the spectacular feelings of excitement and community present at this festival. Easter Monday or Anjo festival is a remnant of a pagan festival, formerly called &quot;Festa da Hera&quot;&quot; (The Ivy Festival), in which several family picnics are held in the woods.

Carnival is a traditional festival in Póvoa de Varzim with the old Carnival Balls, masked people gathering in Rua da Junqueira until the late 1970s which led to the 1980s expensive carnival parades in the waterfront. The remains of such organized events are now celebrated spontaneously by the people who gather for a parade in Avenida dos Banhos. Despite not having any sort of advertising or media coverage, Póvoa&#x27;s &quot;Spontaneous Carnival&quot; (&quot;Carnaval dos espontâneos&quot;) started to attract thousands of people.

Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s waterfront is a beach and nightlife area popular with tourists and locals alike. Avenida dos Banhos, along Redonda and Salgueira beaches, is an iconic venue, with nightclubs, bars, and esplanades along the way. Passeio Alegre is a beach square filled with esplanades and nearby Caetano de Oliveira Square, to the north, is a small lively square, with several bars where younger Povoans meet, before going on to the nightclubs. Póvoa has an LGBT-friendly history since the late 1990s and held the Northern Portugal Pride, the first city in the North to hold a gay pride festival, which ended in 2005, due to climbing rental prices. It was organized by former Hit Club and ILGA Portugal.

Póvoa de Varzim has been a writers Mecca since the 19th century, gathering in tertulia sessions.

The &quot;Arquivo Municipal&quot; is the city&#x27;s archive planned for those who are interested in tracing their family pedigree chart or scrutinize the city&#x27;s records.

===Ethnography===
The culture of Póvoa de Varzim derives from different working classes and with influences arriving from the maritime route from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean. The docudrama film &quot;Ala-Arriba!&quot; by José Leitão de Barros, popularized this unique Portuguese fishing community within the country during the 1940s. The local expression &quot;ala-arriba&quot; means &quot;go upwards&quot; and it represents the co-operation between the inhabitants.

Siglas Poveiras are a form of proto-writing system, with a restricted number of symbols that were combined to form more complex symbols; these were used as a rudimentary visual communication system, and as a signature to mark belongings. Merchants wrote them in their books of credit; fishermen used it in religious rituals by marking them in the door of Catholic chapels near hills or beaches; in the table of the church during marriage and in their tombstone; and also had magical significance, such as the &quot;São Selimão sigla&quot;, that could be used as a protecting symbol and not as family mark. Children used the same family mark with &quot;piques&quot; as a form of cadency. The youngest son would not have any pique and would inherit his father&#x27;s symbol. The &quot;siglas&quot; are still used, though much less commonly, by some families; and are related with Viking traditions.

The Poveiro is a specific genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the &quot;Lancha Poveira&quot;, was believed to be derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old. Women govern the family because men were usually away from home fishing.
The Branqueta is the traditional dress of the fishermen of Póvoa de Varzim. The Camisola Poveira are pullovers, part of the dress, that have fishery motifs in white, black and red, with the name of the owner embroidered in siglas poveiras. Other dresses include the urban tricana poveira for women and children&#x27;s caps. Handicrafts include the &quot;Tapetes de Beiriz&quot; rustic carpets.

Formerly, the population was divided into different &quot;castes&quot;, &quot;Lanchões&quot;, &quot;Rasqueiros&quot;, and &quot;Sardinheiros&quot; which were stratified depending on their Poveiro boat and fisheries caught. Apart from them, the &quot;Lavradores&quot; (the farmers) and the &quot;Sargaceiros&quot; and &quot;Seareiros&quot;, who went to the sea searching for fertilizers. As a rule, the groups remained distinct, and mixed marriages between them were forbidden, mostly because of the isolationism of the fishermen.

São Félix Hill is a reference point for fishermen at sea and on the last Sunday of May, there is the Pilgrimage of &quot;Nossa Senhora da Saúde&quot; (Our Lady of Good Health) which covers a distance of between the Matriz Church and the hill. In Cape Santo André there is the Saint&#x27;s Rock, which has a mark that the Povoan fishermen believe to be a footprint of Saint Andrew. The saint is seen as the &quot;Boatman of Souls&quot;, fishing the souls of those who drown in the sea after a shipwreck and helped in fisheries and marriages. The procession to the cape occurs on the dawn of the last day of November, when groups of men and women, wearing black hoods and holding lamps, go to the chapel via the beach. On 15 August, the pinnacle of the fishermen&#x27;s Feast of the Assumption occurs in the seaport with carefully arranged boats and fireworks. In mid-September, there&#x27;s the Senhora das Dores festival with the century-old Pottery Fair.

===Cuisine===
The most traditional ingredients of the local cuisine are locally grown vegetables and fish. The fish used in the traditional cuisine are divided in two categories, the &quot;poor&quot; fish (sardine, ray, mackerel, and others) and the &quot;wealthy&quot; fish (such as whiting, snook, and alfonsino). The most famous local dish is &quot;Pescada à Poveira&quot; (&quot;Poveira&quot; Whiting), whose main ingredients are, along with the fish that gives the name to the dish, potatoes, eggs and a boiled onion and tomato sauce. Other fishery dishes include the &quot;Arroz de Sardinha&quot; (sardine rice), &quot;Caldeirada de Peixe&quot; (fish stew), &quot;Lulas Recheadas à Poveiro&quot; (&quot;Poveiro&quot; stuffed squids), &quot;Arroz de Marisco&quot; (seafood rice) and &quot;Lagosta Suada&quot; (steamed spiny lobster). Shellfish and boiled &quot;iscas&quot;, &quot;pataniscas&quot;, and bolinhos de bacalhau are popular snacks. Other dishes include &quot;Feijoada Poveira&quot;, made with white beans and served with dry rice (&quot;arroz seco&quot;); and Francesinha Poveira made in long bread that first appeared in 1962 as fast food for holidaymakers.

Restaurants specializing in Portuguese barbecued chicken, seafood, francesinha, bacalhau can be found along the Estrada Nacional 13 road and other areas of the city.

<doc id="316456" wikidata="Q1197271" url="?curid=316456" title="Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)">
<text>The Treaty of Saint Petersburg (; ) between the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire was signed on 7 May 1875, and its ratifications exchanged at Tokyo on 22 August 1875. The treaty itself went into effect in 1877.

Its terms stipulated that Japan cedes to Russia the part of Sakhalin island it then owned in exchange for the group of the Kuril Islands owned by Russia (between Iturup island and the Kamchatka Peninsula). Consequently, Sakhalin island as a whole became Russian territory, and the entire Kuril archipelago Japanese territory.

The authentic text of the treaty is written in French. Differences with its Japanese translation contributed to the controversy on what constitutes the Kuril islands, claims to which Japan renounced in 1951 by the Treaty of San Francisco. The Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875) is part of an ongoing, and long-standing, territorial dispute between Russia and Japan over the jurisdiction of the Kuril Islands.

== Background ==

=== Golovnin Incident ===
In 1811, Vasily Golovnin, a Russian explorer tasked by Tsar Alexander I with mapping the Kuril Islands, was captured by the Japanese. When Golovnin and his crew aboard the ship &quot;Diana&quot; approached Kunashir Island, they were taken ashore and imprisoned for violating Sakoku, or Japanese isolationist policies. Golovnin and his crew were held prisoner for two years and were released in 1813. This event, known as the Golovnin Incident, demonstrated that the border between Russia and Japan was too vague for the Russian Empire, and that to avoid another episode such as Golovnin&#x27;s, the border needed to be clearly defined.

=== Treaty of Shimoda ===
The Treaty of Shimoda of 1855 had defined the border between Japan and Russia to be the strait between Iturup (Etorofu) and Urup (Uruppu) islands in the Kurile chain, but had left the status of Sakhalin (Karafuto) open. Without well-defined borders, incidents between Russian and Japanese settlers began to occur. In order to remedy this situation, the Japanese government sent an ambassador, Enomoto Takeaki, to Saint Petersburg to clearly define the border in this area. After a year of negotiations, Japan agreed to renounce its claims to Sakhalin, with compensation for Japanese residents, access by the fishing fleet to the Sea of Okhotsk, ten-years free use of Russian ports in the area and ownership of all of the Kuril Islands. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs still cites this treaty as the justification for treating the Kuril Islands as its the northernmost territory.

=== Russo-Japanese Provisional Treaty of Karafuto Island ===
A precursor to the Saint Petersburg Treaty was the Provisional Treaty of Karafuto Island, following another incident where a Japanese official was arrested near Kusunai (now Ilyinskoye). This provisional treaty was signed on March 30, 1867, but had no effect as both sides could not agree on the stipulating terms.

== Effects Post-1875 ==
=== Treaty of Portsmouth ===
The Treaty of Portsmouth ended the Russo-Japanese War on September 5, 1905. Its terms stipulated that Russia cede the southern half of Sakhalin to Japan at fifty degrees North latitude. This treaty changed the border between Russian and Japanese territories as had been previously decided by the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg.

=== Treaty of San Francisco ===
The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, effectively ended the war between the Allies of World War II and Japan. This treaty was signed by 48 allied countries, excluding the Soviet Union. Article 2 Section C of the treaty stated that &quot;Japan renounces all right, title and claim to the Kurile Islands, and to that portion of Sakhalin and the islands adjacent to it over which Japan acquired sovereignty as a consequence of the Treaty of Portsmouth of September 5, 1905.&quot; This did not, however, give the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union refused to sign the Treaty of San Francisco for these reasons, with Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko stating the Soviet claim to the Kuril[e] islands and Sakhalin as being &quot;indisputable.&quot;

=== Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration (1956) ===
Since the Soviet Union did not sign the Treaty of San Francisco, the war between Japan and the Soviet Union was not officially ended until the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956. This declaration did not end the dispute over Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, as it set precedence for a peace treaty to be created in the future that would solve the issue of the Kuril Islands. The declaration stated that the Soviet Union would cede Shikotan Island and the Habomai Islands after the peace treaty was signed, but such a treaty never happened.

<doc id="316457" wikidata="Q297628" url="?curid=316457" title="Saionji Kinmochi">
<text>Prince was a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1906 to 1908, and from 1911 to 1912. As the last surviving member of the &quot;genrō&quot;, the group of senior statesmen who had directed policy during the Meiji era, he was one of the most influential voices in Japanese politics from the mid-1920s to the early 1930s. For much of his career, Saionji worked to diminish the influence of the Imperial Japanese Army in political issues.

Born in Kyoto to a noble family, Saionji took part in the Boshin War and Meiji Restoration of 1868. From 1871 to 1880, he studied European law and political institutions in France, and founded Meiji University in 1881. In 1882, Saionji again traveled to Europe with Itō Hirobumi to study constitutional law. On his return, he joined the Privy Council, serving as its president from 1900 to 1903, and twice served as Minister of Education in Itō&#x27;s cabinets. In 1900, Saionji assisted Itō in organizing the Rikken Seiyūkai party. Both of Saionji&#x27;s premierships ended under pressure from an expansionist military. He led the Japanese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, and was given the title of prince in 1920. Saionji was on the list of those to be assassinated in the February 26 incident, a failed coup in 1936, but survived and died in 1940.

==Early life==
Kinmochi was born in Kyoto as the son of Udaijin Tokudaiji Kin&#x27;ito (1821–1883), head of a &quot;kuge&quot; family of court nobility. He was adopted by another &quot;kuge&quot; family, the Saionji, in 1851. However, he grew up near his biological parents, since both the Tokudaiji and Saionji lived very near the Kyoto Imperial Palace. The young Saionji Kinmochi was frequently ordered to visit the palace as a playmate of the young prince who later became Emperor Meiji. Over time they became close friends. Kinmochi&#x27;s biological brother Tokudaiji Sanetsune later became the Grand Chamberlain of Japan. Another younger brother was adopted into the very wealthy Sumitomo family and as Sumitomo Kichizaemon became the head of the Sumitomo zaibatsu. Sumitomo money largely financed Saionji&#x27;s political career. His close relationship to the Imperial Court opened all doors to him. In his later political life, as the &quot;last elder,&quot; he gave advice to the Taisho and Showa Emperors and had a great influence on the political world as a practical selector of prime ministers.

==Meiji Restoration==
As the heir of a noble family, Saionji participated in politics from an early age and was known for his brilliant talent. He took part in the climactic events of his time, the Boshin War, the revolution in Japan of 1867 and 1868, which overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate and installed the young Emperor Meiji as the (nominal) head of the government. Some noblemen at the Imperial Court considered the war to be a private dispute of the samurai of Satsuma and Chōshū against those of the Tokugawa. Saionji held the strong opinion that the nobles of the Imperial Court should seize the initiative and take part in the war. He participated in various battles as an imperial representative.

One of his first encounters involved taking Kameoka Castle without a fight. The next encounter was at Sasayama Castle. Several hundred Samurai from both sides met on the road nearby, but the defenders immediately surrendered. Then Fukuchiyama surrendered without a fight. By this time he had acquired an Imperial banner made by Iwakura Tomomi, featuring a sun and moon on a red field. Other Samurai did not want to attack the army with the imperial banner, and readily deserted the &quot;shōgun&quot;. After two weeks Saionji reached Kitsuki, and following another bloodless encounter, Saionji returned by ship to Osaka. Matters did eventually come to an end at Nagaoka Castle. However, Saionji was relieved from command in the actual battle and appointed governor of Echigo.

==Overseas study tour==

After the Meiji Restoration, Saionji resigned. With the support of Ōmura Masujirō he studied French in Tokyo. He left Japan on the SS &quot;Costa Rica&quot; with a group of thirty other Japanese students sailing to San Francisco. He traveled on to Washington, D.C. where he met Ulysses Grant, President of the United States of America. He then crossed the Atlantic, spent 13 days in London sightseeing, before finally arriving in Paris on 27 May 1871. Paris was in the turmoil of the Commune, and Paris was not safe for Saionji – indeed his tutor was shot when they stumbled upon a street battle. Saionji went to Switzerland and Nice, before settling in Marseilles, where he learned French with the accent of that city. He made his way to Paris following the suppression of the Commune. He studied law at the University of Paris and became involved with Émile Acollas, who had set up the Acollas Law School for foreign students studying law in Paris. These were the early years of the Third Republic, a time of high idealism in France. Saionji arrived in France with highly reactionary views but he was influenced by Acollas (a former member of the League of Peace and Freedom) and became the most liberal of Japanese major political figures of his generation. When the Iwakura Mission visited Paris in 1872, Iwakura was quite worried about the radicalism of Saionji and other Japanese students. He made many acquaintances in France, including Franz Liszt, the Goncourt brothers, and the fellow Sorbonne student Georges Clemenceau.

On his return to Japan, he founded Meiji Law School, which later evolved into Meiji University in 1880.

In 1882, Itō Hirobumi visited Europe to research the constitutional systems of each major European country, and he asked Saionji to accompany him, as they knew each other very well. After the trip, he was appointed ambassador to Austria-Hungary and later to Germany and Belgium.

==Political career==
Returning to Japan, Saionji joined the Privy Council, and served as vice president of the House of Peers. He also served as Minister of Education in the 2nd and 3rd Itō administrations (1894–1896, 1898) and 2nd Matsukata administration. During his tenure, he strove to improve the quality of the educational curriculum towards an international (i.e. western) standard.

In 1900, Itō founded the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; political party, and Saionji joined as one of the first members. Due to his experiences in Europe, Saionji had a liberal political point of view and supported parliamentary government. He was one of the few early politicians who claimed that the majority party in parliament had to be the basis for forming a cabinet.

Saionji became president of the Privy Council in August 1900, and president of the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; in 1903.

==Prime minister==

From 7 January 1906, to 14 July 1908, and again from 30 August 1911, to 21 December 1912, Saionji served as Prime Minister of Japan.

Both his ministries were marked by continuing tension between Saionji and the powerful arch-conservative genrō, Field Marshal Yamagata Aritomo. Saionji and Itō saw political parties as a useful part of the machinery of government; Yamagata looked on political parties and all democratic institutions as quarrelsome, corrupt, and irrational.

Saionji had to struggle with the national budget with many demands and finite resources, Yamagata sought ceaselessly the greatest expansion of the army. Saionji&#x27;s first cabinet was brought down in 1908 by conservatives led by Yamagata who were alarmed at the growth of communism and socialism, who felt the government&#x27;s suppression of communists and socialists (after a parade and riots) had been insufficiently forceful.

The fall of Saionji&#x27;s second cabinet was a major reverse to constitutional government. The Taishō Crisis (so named for the newly enthroned emperor) erupted in late November 1912, out of the continuing bitter dispute over the military budget. The army minister, General Uehara, unable to get the cabinet to agree on the army&#x27;s demands, resigned. Saionji sought to replace Uehara.

A Japanese law (intended to give added power to the army and navy) required that the army minister must be a lieutenant general or general on active duty. All of the eligible generals, on Yamagata&#x27;s instruction, refused to serve in Saionji&#x27;s cabinet. The cabinet was then forced to resign. The precedent had been established that the army could force the resignation of a cabinet.

Saionji&#x27;s political philosophy was heavily influenced by his background; he believed the Imperial Court should be guarded and that it should not participate directly in politics: the same strategy employed by noblemen and the Court in Kyoto for hundreds of years. This was another point in which he was opposed by nationalists in the Army, who wished for the Emperor to participate in Japanese politics directly and thus weaken both parliament and the cabinet. Nationalists also accused him of being a &quot;globalist&quot;.

==Elder statesman==


Saionji was appointed a &quot;genrō&quot; in December 1912. The role of the &quot;genrō&quot; at this time was diminishing; their main function was to choose the prime ministers – formally, to nominate candidates for prime minister to the Emperor for approval, but no Emperor ever rejected their advice. From the death of Matsukata Masayoshi in 1924, Saionji was the sole surviving &quot;genrō&quot;. He exercised his prerogative of naming the prime ministers very nearly until his death in 1940 at the age of 90. Saionji, when he could, chose as prime minister the president of the majority party in the Diet, but his power was always constrained by the necessity of at least the tacit consent of the army and navy. He could choose political leaders only when they might be strong enough to form an effective government. He nominated military men and non-party politicians when he felt necessary.

In 1919, Saionji led the Japanese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, though his role remained largely confined to a symbolic role due to ill health. During the negotiations, Saionji proposed the addition of a &quot;racial equality clause&quot; to the Covenant of the League of Nations, though this met with strong American and Australian resistance (both nations being racially segregated) and was not adopted. Saionji, by now an unmarried 70-year old, was accompanied to Paris by his son, his favorite daughter, and his current mistress. In 1920, he was given the title &quot;kōshaku&quot; (, Prince) as an honor for a life in public service.

He was detested by Japanese militarists and was on the list of those to be assassinated in the attempted coup of February 26, 1936. Upon receiving news of the mutiny, Saionji fled in his car but was pursued for a great distance by a suspicious vehicle that he and his companions assumed held soldiers bent on his murder. In actuality, it held newspaper reporters.

For much of his career, Saionji tried to diminish the influence of the Imperial Japanese Army in political issues. He was one of the most liberal of Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s advisors, and favored friendly relations with Great Britain and the United States. However, he was careful to pick his battles, and would concede defeat when he knew he could not win (e.g. his inability to prevent the Tripartite Pact).

Political scientist Kenneth Colegrove wrote in 1936 that Saionji had &quot;extensive&quot; influence over Japanese politics.

<doc id="316466" wikidata="Q1058864" url="?curid=316466" title="NRG Stadium">
<text>NRG Stadium (previously known as Reliant Stadium) is a multi-purpose stadium in Houston, Texas, United States. Construction was completed in 2002, at a cost of $352 million and has a seating capacity of 72,220. It was the first NFL facility to have a retractable roof.

The stadium is the home of the National Football League&#x27;s Houston Texans, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, the Texas Bowl, many of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team&#x27;s matches, Mexico national football team friendlies where &quot;El Tri&quot; serves as the host, and other events. The stadium served as the host facility for Super Bowls XXXVIII (2004) and LI (2017), the 2024 College Football Playoff National Championship, and WrestleMania 25 (2009). The stadium will host multiple matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

NRG Stadium is part of a collection of venues (including the Astrodome), which are collectively called NRG Park. The entire complex is named for NRG Energy under a 32-year, $300 million naming rights deal in 2000.

==History==
The Houston NFL Holdings group came to HOK Sport (now Populous) to begin the schematic design for the first-ever NFL retractable roof football stadium in 1997. The intention was to create a football stadium to replace the Astrodome that would operate like an open-air facility but have the intimacy and comfort of an indoor arena. With the design for football and the square footage requirements of the rodeo, the building was designed in the range. Groundbreaking for the stadium was on March 9, 2000 and the building was officially topped off in October 2001. Construction was completed in 30 months.

The stadium opened on August 24, 2002, with a preseason game between the Miami Dolphins and Houston Texans which the Dolphins won 24–3. The stadium hosted its first regular season NFL football game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans on September 8, 2002 which the Texans won against their interstate rival 19-10. The first rodeo was held in the stadium in February 2003.

During a Texans preseason game on August 30, 2012, against the Minnesota Vikings, an intoxicated fan fell to his death from an escalator.

On March 19, 2014, the stadium was renamed NRG Stadium, after NRG Energy, the parent company of Reliant Energy.

During the 2015 season, a permanent artificial surface was installed at NRG Stadium. The Texans had used a natural surface since the stadium opened, using a system of trays of sod similar to one used at Giants Stadium in its experiment with using a grass surface. In recent years, the stadium installed artificial turf to be used during high school and college games while keeping the grass for Texans games. After the Texans&#x27; home opener, complaints about the field conditions finally led to the installation of the artificial surface for Texans games. The surface brand is UBU Speed, which is part of Act Global.

In 2017, NRG Stadium selected Hellas Construction to install its Matrix Turf with Helix Technology at the stadium. The three year contract calls for a new turf field each year.

After hosting Super Bowl LI, further upgrades were made to keep NRG Stadium competitive with other new NFL venues. The stadium&#x27;s first major renovation in 15 years modernized the office and team facilities.

On April 19, 2023, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo renamed NRG Stadium to NRG Stadium (Taylor&#x27;s Version) to celebrate Taylor Swift&#x27;s much anticipated Eras Tour.

On December 25, 2024, the first ever halftime show for the NFL&#x27;s Christmas Gameday is set to be headlined by Beyoncé at NRG Stadium.

===Hurricane Ike damage===
On the night of September 12–13, 2008 the stadium sustained damage from Hurricane Ike forcing the Houston Texans home opener scheduled for September 14 to be postponed. Part of the roof cladding came off, and there was wind and water damage to other sections of the stadium. There were also large pieces of debris inside the stadium from the hurricane and the stadium authority declared that the stadium did not suffer significant structural damage except for the roof, and the Texans would be able to play all of their 8 home games at Reliant Stadium with the roof open.

The Texans&#x27; home opener against the Baltimore Ravens was initially postponed one day from Sunday, September 14, 2008, to Monday, September 15, but when the extent of the damage from Hurricane Ike became known, the NFL rescheduled the Texans-Ravens game to week 10 (November 9, 2008), which was to have been the bye week for the Ravens and the Texans&#x27; scheduled home game against the Cincinnati Bengals. That game was rescheduled to week 8 (October 26), which was to have been the bye week for both the Texans and Bengals. The Bengals&#x27; bye week was moved from October 26. The Texans and Ravens took their unexpected bye week in week 2, the weekend Hurricane Ike hit East Texas and the Gulf Coast, despite the fact that both teams were preparing that whole week to play that game as scheduled.

The stadium reopened on October 5, 2008, when the Texans hosted the Indianapolis Colts and hosted three additional home games in October.

The stadium was repaired by Houston-based rope access inspection and construction firm Reel Group Americas on February 13, 2009.

==Design and technology==

The stadium was designed by the architectural firms of Hermes Reed Architects and Lockwood, Andrews and Newnam who were teamed to create the Houston Stadium Consultants (HSC). The architects of Populous (then HOK Sport) and the HSC worked together with engineers from Walter P Moore and Uni-Systems to design the stadium utilizing the principles of kinetic architecture. The facility offers a sense of transparency, with its fabric roof and expansive areas of glazing. At night, the building appears to glow from within. The extensive use of glass provides an open-air feel to the concourses, which are open to the field of play. NRG Stadium has over 7,000 club seats, 186 luxury suites, and multiple lounges and bars. The stadium can be configured to utilize a space for meetings, specialty functions, exhibits, and concerts.

One of the most notable aspects of the design is the stadium&#x27;s retractable, fabric roof. The roof mechanization consists of two large panels that split apart at the 50 yard line, lying over and above each end zone when fully retracted. 10 parallel, tri-chord trusses ride on two parallel rails, each supported by a large, -long super-truss. Roof operation is controlled in the stadium press box via computer, containing live images of the travel path of each roof panel; plus, furnishing live feedback from all roof components throughout the operation. The roof panels can be opened or closed in as little as 7 minutes, moving at a speed of up to -per-minute.

One bleacher section behind the north end zone, called the &quot;Bull Pen&quot;, is the designated fan section for the hometeam. The fans in the Bull Pen interact directly with the action on the field, helping to create and implement fan traditions, songs, chants, and other elements of the game-day experience for spectators all over the stadium. Fans in the Bull Pen are encouraged to stand throughout the game, sing, cheer, and otherwise support the team in an enthusiastic manner.

In 2011, Reliant updated their logo and therefore had to update their signage all over the stadium.

In December 2012, it was announced that, in order to help bring the Super Bowl back to Houston, the stadium&#x27;s end zone displays would be replaced with the largest digital displays in any professional sports venue. The video screens were revealed August 16, 2013 and are the second largest of their kind, at a total of of screens. This tops the previous record of AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington. This has since been topped by the digital display boards located in TIAA Bank Field, the home of the Jacksonville Jaguars, now home to the largest digital display boards in any stadium in the world.

==Stadium usage==
===Sports===
====Football====

The Houston Texans have played their home games at NRG Stadium (or Reliant Stadium) since their inception in 2002. The annual calendar consists of 8 regular season and 1-2 pre-season games, plus any playoff games the Texans host. The first game played was on August 24, 2002, in front of 69,432 in attendance as the Texans hosted the Miami Dolphins in their first preseason game. The first regular season game was played on September 8 of that year, where the expansion Texans defeated the Dallas Cowboys 19–10 in front of 69,604. The first Monday Night Football game in Texans history was held on December 1, 2008 at Reliant Stadium. Playing in front of a then-franchise-record crowd of 70,809, the Texans defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 30–17. Since then that record crowd has been broken in the next 2 Texans home games of that season. Their December 7, 2008 home game against the Tennessee Titans saw a then-record crowd of 70,831 and the December 28, 2008 home finale against the Chicago Bears drew then a current franchise-crowd record of 70,838. That record was broken on November 23, 2009, when a record crowd of 71,153 was in attendance during the Texans&#x27; second ever Monday Night Football game against Houston&#x27;s former NFL team, the Tennessee Titans. The Texans&#x27; home finale of the 2009 season against the New England Patriots on January 3, 2010 drew 71,029.

NRG Stadium has hosted 2 Super Bowls: Super Bowl XXXVIII (which was marred by a controversial halftime show) and Super Bowl LI (which was the first Super Bowl to go into overtime); both games pitted the New England Patriots against a team from the NFC South.

NRG Stadium hosted Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1, 2004 where the New England Patriots defeated the Carolina Panthers, 32–29 in front of 71,525 in attendance.

NRG Stadium hosted the Texans&#x27; first playoff game in franchise history on January 7, 2012, with Houston defeating the Cincinnati Bengals 31–10 in an AFC wild card game, drawing 71,725, the largest crowd ever to see a Texans game at Reliant Stadium.

NRG Stadium hosted Super Bowl LI in 2017, in which the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history; it was also the first ever overtime game in Super Bowl history.

====Rodeo====
The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo (or RodeoHouston) is a co-tenant of NRG Stadium. &quot;The building is as much for the rodeo as it is for the National Football League,&quot; according to Leroy Shafer who is assistant general manager of the rodeo&#x27;s marketing department. The rodeo is held three weeks in March, each year. During this time NRG Stadium also hosts an event on the Xtreme Bulls tour, the bull riding-only tour that is part of the PRCA, who also hosts the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

The stadium includes a service area level to house rodeo livestock. The bulls, broncs, steers and roping calves are housed in the north end of the stadium under the lower bowl. Loading and unloading dock space to support the rodeo is located on the north end of the stadium. During rodeo performances, rolling doors will separate the dock into two receiving areas to isolate the food and concession deliveries from the rodeo equipment and livestock deliveries. A concert performance stage is located at the south end of the stadium during rodeo events and is moved into the center of the facility by a hydraulic drive system for rodeo concert performances.

On February 25, 2012, the PBR brought its premier bull riding tour, the Built Ford Tough Series, to Reliant Stadium for the first time ever. It was the first time that a PBR event was a part of RodeoHouston. In addition, it was their first event in Houston in 11 years, after having previously held an event at the Compaq Center annually between 1998 and 2001.

====College football====
College football&#x27;s Texas Bowl and Texas Kickoff are annually hosted at the stadium. The first-ever edition of the Texas Bowl featured a game between Rutgers University and Kansas State University, with Rutgers winning 37–10. The stadium hosted the Houston Bowl before the Texas Bowl&#x27;s inception and also hosted both the 2002 and 2005 Big 12 Championship Games. The 2005 game featured Houston native Vince Young at quarterback for the University of Texas at Austin and led the Longhorns to a 70–3 rout of the University of Colorado in front of 71,107. In addition, the East–West Shrine Game was held there in 2007.

A Bayou Classic game between Grambling State and Southern was held here in November 2005 due to Hurricane Katrina damage at the rivalry&#x27;s usual venue of the Superdome.

Each of the city&#x27;s two Division I FBS schools, the University of Houston and Rice University, has played regular season home games at NRG Stadium in the past. The Houston–Rice football rivalry game, the Bayou Bucket Classic, was held there in 2004, and in 2011, the game was announced to be played at Reliant Stadium for the 2012 and 2013 seasons as well.

The stadium also hosts the &quot;Battle of the Piney Woods&quot; since 2010. It is one of the oldest football rivalries in Texas, featuring Division I FCS Sam Houston State University and Stephen F. Austin State University. The series was originally scheduled to run until 2013, before being extended to 2017, and finally in April 2015, the stadium was made the permanent home of the series.

The two largest historically black universities in Texas, Texas Southern University and Prairie View A&amp;M University, each have played selected regular season home games at NRG Stadium as well.

The SWAC Championship Game was held at the stadium from 2013 until 2017.

In 2017, NRG Stadium was announced as a future site for the College Football Playoff National Championship game; it hosted the event on January 8, 2024 (ending the 2023 college football season), which featured the Michigan Wolverines (winners of the Rose Bowl) and the Washington Huskies (winners of the Sugar Bowl).
