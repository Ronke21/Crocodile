<text>The Dark Ride is the ninth studio album by German power metal band Helloween, released in 2000. The album&#x27;s style was quite different from &quot;Better Than Raw&quot; as it had a much darker sound, drop-tuned guitars, and gruffer vocals. The album was produced by Roy Z and Charlie Bauerfeind. It is the last studio album to feature &quot;Master of the Rings&quot;-era lineup with the dismissal of guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch after completion of the supporting tour for the album. They went on to form the band Masterplan.

The album contains two singles, which are &quot;If I Could Fly&quot; and &quot;Mr. Torture&quot;.

On a later interview, bassist Markus Grosskopf commented on the album, saying: &quot;&quot;The Dark Ride&quot; was kind of constructed, all the people were telling us try this, let&#x27;s do this, you know, it&#x27;s a good album but it&#x27;s a very difficult way to do records when there&#x27;s somebody always going on your nerves all the time.&quot;

==Track listing==

On some copies of &quot;The Dark Ride&quot; and &quot;Rabbit Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot; (as a special two for the price of one cd) the disc has &quot;Mr. Torture&quot; and &quot;All Over the Nations&quot; in reverse order so this way the latter is track #2. The tracks are also flipped on the Japanese version of the CD. Also on copies of the special two for one cd, there is a listing for track #13, &quot;Far Away&quot; on &quot;Rabbit Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, which does not exist on the CD and is a misprint on the back label.

<text>In baseball, a save (abbreviated SV or S) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain circumstances. A save can be earned by entering a game in which his team is leading by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching at least one inning without losing the lead; entering the game with the tying run in the on-deck circle, at the plate or on the bases and finishing the game; or by pitching at least three innings in relief and finishing the game regardless of how many runs your team was winning by when entering the game. The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers, particularly those in the closer role. The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to &quot;measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers&quot; and was adopted as an official Major League Baseball (MLB) statistic in 1969. The save has been retroactively tabulated for pitchers before that date. Mariano Rivera is MLB&#x27;s all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652, while Francisco Rodríguez earned the most saves in a single season with 62 in 2008.

==History==
The term &quot;save&quot; was being used as far back as 1952. Executives Jim Toomey of the St. Louis Cardinals and Irv Kaze of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and statistician Allan Roth of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers awarded saves to pitchers who finished winning games but were not credited with the win, regardless of the margin of victory. The statistic went largely unnoticed.

The concept of a reliever &quot;saving&quot; a baseball game for a starting pitcher goes back even further. A 1933 Goudey baseball card of Firpo Marberry of the Detroit Tigers states he &quot;Specializes in saving ball games when other pitchers are getting their bumps.&quot;

A formula with more criteria for saves was invented in 1960 by baseball writer Jerome Holtzman. He felt that the existing statistics at the time, earned run average (ERA) and win–loss record (W-L), did not sufficiently measure a reliever&#x27;s effectiveness. ERA does not account for inherited runners a reliever allows to score, and W-L record does not account for relievers protecting leads. Elroy Face of the Pittsburgh Pirates was 18–1 in 1959; however, Holtzman wrote that in 10 of the 18 wins, Face allowed the tying or lead run but got the win when the Pirates offense regained the lead. Holtzman felt that Face was more effective the previous year when he was 5–2. When Holtzman presented the idea to J. G. Taylor Spink, publisher of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, &quot;[Spink] gave [Holtzman] a $100 bonus. Maybe it was $200.&quot; Holtzman recorded the unofficial save statistic in &quot;The Sporting News&quot; weekly for nine years before it became official in 1969. In conjunction with publishing the statistic, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in 1960 also introduced the Fireman of the Year Award, which was awarded based on a combination of saves and wins.

The save became an official MLB statistic in . It was MLB&#x27;s first new major statistic since the run batted in was added in 1920.

===Notable saves===

On April 7, 1969, Bill Singer was credited with the first official save when he pitched three shutout innings in relief of Don Drysdale in the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; 3–2 Opening Day victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field.

On April 27, 1969, Frank Linzy of the San Francisco Giants became the first pitcher to be credited with two saves in one day, registering saves in both games of a doubleheader against the Houston Astros.

On April 29, 1970, Stan Williams of the Minnesota Twins became the first pitcher credited with a save without facing a batter. In a home game against the Cleveland Indians with the Twins holding a 1–0 lead, Williams entered in relief of Jim Kaat in the top of the ninth inning with two outs and runners on first and second; he then picked off runner Tony Horton at second base, ending the game.

On September 3, 2002, the Texas Rangers won 7–1 over the Baltimore Orioles as Joaquín Benoit pitched a seven-inning save, the longest save since it had become an official statistic in 1969. Benoit relieved Todd Van Poppel (who entered the game in the first inning after starter Aaron Myette was ejected for throwing at Melvin Mora) at the start of the third inning, and finished the game while allowing just one hit. The official scorer credited the win to Van Poppel and not Benoit, a decision that was also supported by Texas manager Jerry Narron.

On August 22, 2007, Wes Littleton earned a save with the largest winning margin ever, pitching the last three innings of a 30–3 Texas Rangers win over the Baltimore Orioles. Littleton entered the game with a 14–3 lead, and the final 27-run differential broke the previous record for a save by eight runs. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;there are the preposterous saves, of which Littleton&#x27;s now stands out as No. 1.&quot;

On October 29, 2014, in Game 7 of the 2014 World Series, Madison Bumgarner of the San Francisco Giants recorded the longest save in World Series history, pitching five scoreless innings of relief in a 3–2 victory over the Kansas City Royals.

==Usage==
In baseball statistics, the term save is used to indicate the successful maintenance of a lead by a relief pitcher, usually the closer, until the end of the game. A save is a statistic credited to a relief pitcher, as set forth in Rule 9.19 of the Official Rules of Major League Baseball; the current definition has been in place since 1975. That rule states the official scorer shall credit a pitcher with a save when such pitcher meets all four of the following conditions:
#He is the finishing pitcher in a game won by his team;
#He is not the winning pitcher;
#He is credited with at least of an inning pitched; and
#He satisfies one of the following conditions:
##He enters the game with a lead of no more than three runs and pitches for at least one inning
##He enters the game with the potential tying run either on base, at bat or on deck
## He pitches for at least three innings.

The definition of a save has not always been the same. As initially defined in 1969, a relief pitcher could earn a save if he entered a game with his team in the lead and he held the lead through the end of the game, regardless of the score or for how long he pitched. This produced some especially &quot;easy&quot; saves, such as Ron Taylor being credited with a save after pitching a scoreless ninth inning in a 20–6 New York Mets win over the Atlanta Braves in August 1971. In 1974, tougher criteria were adopted for saves where either the tying run had to be on base or at the plate when the reliever entered to qualify for a save, or the reliever had to preserve a lead of any size for at least three innings in completing a game. The rule was slightly relaxed in 1975 to the current definition as outlined above. Statistical sites, including MLB.com, include saves in pitching records prior to 1969 by retroactively applying the 1969 criteria.

===Related statistics===
The ratio of saves to save opportunities is &quot;save percentage&quot;. A save opportunity (or &quot;save situation&quot;) occurs when a reliever enters a game in a situation that permits him to earn a save. A pitcher who enters a game in a save situation and does not finish the game, but departs with his team still leading, is not charged with a save opportunity.

If a relief pitcher satisfies all of the criteria for a save except he does not finish the game, he will often be credited with a hold (abbreviated H), which is a statistic that is not officially recognized by Major League Baseball.

A &quot;blown save&quot; (abbreviated &quot;BS&quot;; alternately BSV or B) occurs when a reliever in a save situation surrenders the lead (allows the tying run, or more, to score). Like the hold, the blown save statistic is not officially recognized by Major League Baseball. The blown save was adopted as part of the points system used by the Rolaids Relief Man Award starting in 1988. If the tying run was scored by a runner who was already on base when the reliever entered the game, the reliever will be charged with a blown save even though the run is charged to the pitcher who allowed that runner to reach base. A reliever cannot blow multiple saves in a game unless he has multiple save opportunities, a situation only possible if the reliever temporarily switches to another defensive position, then returns to pitching.

==Criticism==

As Francisco Rodríguez pursued the single-season saves record in 2008, Baseball Prospectus member Joe Sheehan, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Tom Verducci, and &quot;The New York Sun&quot; writer Tim Marchman wrote that Rodríguez&#x27;s save total was enhanced by the number of opportunities his team presented, allowing him to amass one particular statistic. They thought that Rodríguez on his record-breaking march was less effective than in prior years. Sheehan offered that saves did not account for a pitcher&#x27;s proficiency at preventing runs nor did it reflect leads that were not preserved.

Bradford Doolittle of &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; wrote, &quot;[The closer] is the only example in sports of a statistic creating a job.&quot; He decried the best relievers pitching fewer innings starting in the 1980s with their workload being reduced from two- to one-inning outings while less efficient pitchers were pitching those innings instead. ESPN.com columnist Jim Caple has argued that the save statistic has turned the closer position into &quot;the most overrated position in sports&quot;. Caple and others contend that using one&#x27;s best reliever in situations such as a three-run lead in the ninth—when a team will almost certainly win even with a lesser pitcher—is foolish, and that using a closer in the traditional fireman role exemplified by pitchers such as Goose Gossage is far wiser. (A &quot;fireman&quot; situation is men on base in a tied or close game, hence a reliever ending such a threat is &quot;putting out the fire&quot;.)

Firemen frequently pitched two- or three-inning outings to earn saves. The modern closer, reduced to a one-inning role, is available to pitch more save opportunities. In the past, a reliever pitching three innings one game would be unavailable to pitch the next game. Gossage had more saves of at least two innings than saves where he pitched one inning or less. &quot;The times I did a one-inning save, I felt guilty about it. It&#x27;s like it was too easy&quot;, said Gossage. ESPN.com wrote that saves have not been determined to be &quot;a special, repeatable skill—rather than simply a function of opportunities&quot;. It also noted that blown saves are &quot;non-qualitative&quot;, pointing out that both Gossage and Rollie Fingers, who each had over 100 career blown saves, were both inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Fran Zimniuch in &quot;Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball&quot; wrote, &quot;But you have to be a great relief pitcher to blow that many saves. Clearly, [Gossage] saved many, many more than he did not save.&quot; More than half of Gossage&#x27;s and Fingers&#x27; blown saves came in tough save situations, where the tying run was on base when the pitcher entered. In nearly half of their blown tough saves, they entered the game in the sixth or seventh inning. Multiple-inning outings provide more chances for a reliever to blow a save. The pitchers need to get out of the initial situation and pitch additional innings with more chances to lose the lead. A study by the Baseball Hall of Fame found modern closers were put into fewer tough save situations compared to past relievers. The modern closer also earned significantly more &quot;easy saves&quot;, defined as saves starting the ninth inning with more than a one-run lead. The study offered &quot;praise to the combatants who faced more danger for more innings&quot;.
Nate Silver of &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; has suggested the &quot;goose egg&quot;, a new statistic that he considers to be a better evaluation of relief performance than the save. A reliever earns a goose egg for each scoreless inning pitched (no earned or unearned runs, no inherited runners score) in the seventh inning or later, where when he starts the inning: the score is tied, his team holds a lead of no more than two runs, or the tying run is on base or at the plate. Should the reliever be charged with an earned run in a goose egg situation, he will be credited with a &quot;broken egg&quot;, the counterpart of the blown save, unless he finishes the game. The statistic is named for Goose Gossage, who is the all-time leader in goose eggs but recorded relatively few saves compared to modern closers.

In the piece in which he introduced the &quot;goose egg&quot; concept, Silver added more criticisms of the save, noting, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t give a pitcher any additional reward for pitching multiple innings — even though two clutch innings pitched in relief are roughly twice as valuable as one. And a pitcher doesn&#x27;t get a save for pitching in a tie game, even though it&#x27;s one of the highest-leverage situations.&quot; He also considered saves and blown saves &quot;highly punitive to guys who aren&#x27;t closers.&quot; As an example, Silver noted that in the 2016 season, Chicago White Sox middle reliever Nate Jones, who by Silver&#x27;s calculations converted 83% of his goose opportunities, led the American League in blown saves with nine, while only recording three saves. Silver added, &quot;The problem is that you can only get a save if you finish the game, whereas blown saves aren&#x27;t restricted to the final inning.&quot;

<doc id="313346" wikidata="Q262031" url="?curid=313346" title="Shutout">
<text>In team sports, a shutout (US) or clean sheet (UK) is a game in which the losing team fails to score. While possible in most major sports, they are highly improbable in some sports, such as basketball. Shutouts are usually seen as a result of effective defensive play even though a weak opposing offense may be as much to blame. Some sports credit individual players, particularly goalkeepers and starting pitchers, with shutouts and keep track of them as statistics; others do not.

==American football==
Shutouts in American football are uncommon. Keeping an opponent scoreless in American football requires a team&#x27;s defense to be able to consistently shut down both pass and run offenses over the course of a game. The difficulty of completing a shutout is compounded by the many ways a team can score in the game. For example, teams can attempt field goals, which have a high rate of success. The range of NFL caliber kickers makes it possible for a team with a weak offense to get close enough to the goalposts (within &quot;field goal range&quot;) to kick a field goal. Of 2,544 regular season NFL games from 2000 to 2009, 89 (3.5%) were shutouts.

There are at least five instances in American football in which a team had been shut out throughout an entire season, and four in which a team has shut out all of their opponents in the season (the longest of these being the ten-game perfect season in which the 1933 Providence Huskies did not concede a single point). 

In college football, the Tennessee Volunteers hold the record for most consecutive shutout wins with 17. The streak started against Tennessee-Chattanooga on November 30, 1938 and ended with a 27–12 loss against Alabama on October 19, 1940. 

The achievement of a shutout is much more difficult in Canadian football, where scoring and offensive movement is generally more frequent and a single point can be scored by kicking the ball into the end zone such that the other team does not, or cannot, return it or kick it out of the end zone.

==Association football==
In association football and other sports with a goalkeeper, the goalkeeper may be said to &quot;keep a clean sheet&quot; if they prevent their opponents from scoring during an entire match. Because football is a relatively low-scoring game, it is common for one team, or even both teams, to score no goals. A theory as to the term&#x27;s origin is that sports reporters used separate pieces of paper to record the different statistical details of a game. If one team did not allow a goal, then that team&#x27;s &quot;details of goals conceded&quot; page would appear blank, leaving a clean sheet. If a game ends with a final score of 0–0, both sides are considered to have kept a clean sheet.

==Baseball==
In Major League Baseball, a shutout (denoted statistically as ShO or SHO) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run. If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act, no pitcher will be awarded a shutout, although the team itself can be said to have &quot;shut out&quot; the opposing team. The only exception to this is when a pitcher enters a game before the opposing team scores a run or makes an out and then completes the game without allowing a run to score. That pitcher is then awarded a shutout, although not a complete game.

The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson, who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907 to 1927. He accumulated 110 shutouts, which is 20 more than second placed Grover Cleveland Alexander. The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16, which was a feat accomplished by both Grover Alexander (1916) and George Bradley (1876). These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball, as pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching. Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers. As of 2021, the current active leader in shutouts is Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose 15 shutouts ties him for 463rd all time. Only four pitchers whose entire careers were in the post-1920 live-ball era threw as many as 60 career shutouts, with Warren Spahn leading those pitchers with 63.

==Ice hockey==
In ice hockey, a shutout (SO) is credited to a goaltender who successfully stops the other team from scoring during the entire game. In regular season games, if the score is 0–0 with the game going to a penalty shootout, both goaltenders are credited with a shutout. The record holder for most regular-season career shutouts in the National Hockey League (NHL) is Martin Brodeur with 125 (see the all-time regular season shutout leaders). For a single NHL season, the most shutouts recorded by a goaltender is 22, by George Hainsworth during the 1928–29 season. The modern-day record for a team being shut out in a season is held by the Columbus Blue Jackets at 16, during the 2006–07 season.

In the event that a shutout is accomplished by a team using more than one goaltender in the game, the shutout is credited to the team, and no goaltender is awarded a shutout. This has happened several times in NHL history:
* On April 3, 1983, the Washington Capitals won 3–0 against the New York Rangers with Al Jensen in goals for the first two periods and Pat Riggin for the last period.
* On November 23, 2006, the Nashville Predators won 6–0 against the Vancouver Canucks with goaltender Tomáš Vokoun being replaced at the start of the third period by Chris Mason due to injury.
* On December 1, 2009, the Toronto Maple Leafs won 3–0 against the Montreal Canadiens. Jonas Gustavsson started in goal but was replaced after the first period by Joey MacDonald because of a cardiac problem.
* On March 26, 2013, the Pittsburgh Penguins won 1–0 against the Montreal Canadiens with Marc-André Fleury starting the game and being replaced because of injury by Tomáš Vokoun for the third period.
* On December 3, 2021, the New York Rangers won 1–0 against the San Jose Sharks after Igor Shesterkin was injured and replaced by Alexandar Georgiev in the third period.
* On March 10, 2024, the Edmonton Oilers won 4–0 against the Pittsburgh Penguins after Calvin Pickard was replaced with Stuart Skinner for the last 1:16 of the second period and did not face a shot. Pickard then returned for the third period.

==Rugby==
Clean sheets are not common in either rugby union or league, since it is relatively simple to score a penalty kick. The 2005 Gillette Rugby League Tri-Nations final was the first time that Australia had been &quot;nilled&quot; since 1981. There is no alternative term for the occurrence of a team failing to score, except to say that the team scored &quot;nil&quot; (or &quot;zero&quot; or &quot;nothing&quot; in North America). For example, the December 2006 Celtic League match between Munster and Connacht ended 13–0 to Munster; it was, therefore, said that Munster won &quot;thirteen–nil.&quot;

Recent examples of clean sheets in international rugby union include England vs Scotland in 2014, France vs Italy in 2015, France vs Argentina in 2016, Scotland vs Italy in 2017, New Zealand vs South Africa in 2017, New Zealand vs Australia in 2019, and Wales vs Italy in 2020.

Generally, a team that is well-disciplined defensively, as well as behaviorally (not giving away penalty kicks), is most likely to not concede scores. This may also occur if there is a significant difference in class between the two teams, for example, when Scotland beat Spain (who were playing in their only Rugby World Cup) 48–0 in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, or when Australia beat Namibia 142–0 in the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

<doc id="313348" wikidata="Q184656" url="?curid=313348" title="Nikolai Berdyaev">
<text>Nikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev (; ;  – 24 March 1948) was a Russian philosopher, theologian, and Christian existentialist who emphasized the existential spiritual significance of human freedom and the human person. Alternative historical spellings of his surname in English include &quot;Berdiaev&quot; and &quot;Berdiaeff&quot;, and of his given name &quot;Nicolas&quot; and &quot;Nicholas&quot;.

==Biography==

Nikolai Berdyaev was born near Kiev in 1874 to an aristocratic military family. His father, Alexander Mikhailovich Berdyaev, came from a long line of Russian nobility. Almost all of Alexander Mikhailovich&#x27;s ancestors served as high-ranking military officers, but In the sixth grade, he left the cadet school and began studying for the matriculation exams for admission to the university. Nikolai&#x27;s mother, Alina Sergeevna Berdyaeva, was half-French and came from the top levels of both French and Russian nobility. She also had Polish and Tatar origins.

Berdyaev decided on an intellectual career and entered the Kiev University in 1894. It was a time of revolutionary fervor among the students and the intelligentsia. He became a Marxist for a period and was arrested in a student demonstration and expelled from the university. His involvement in illegal activities led in 1897 to three years of internal exile to Vologda in northern Russia.

== Social activities ==
In 1899, his first article &quot;F. A. Lange and Critical Philosophy in their relation to Socialism&quot; was published in the magazine &quot;Die Neue Zeit&quot;.

In the following years, before his expulsion from the USSR in 1922, Berdyaev wrote numerous articles and several books, of which, according to him, he later truly appreciated only two — &quot;The Meaning of Creativity&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of History.&quot;

A fiery 1913 article, entitled &quot;Quenchers of the Spirit&quot;, criticising the rough purging of Imiaslavie Russian monks on Mount Athos by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church using tsarist troops, caused him to be charged with the crime of blasphemy, the punishment for which was exile to Siberia for life. The World War and the Bolshevik Revolution prevented the matter coming to trial.

Berdyaev&#x27;s disaffection culminated, in 1919, with the foundation of his own private academy, the &quot;Free Academy of Spiritual Culture&quot;. It was primarily a forum for him to lecture on the hot topics of the day and to present them from a Christian point of view. He also presented his opinions in public lectures, and every Tuesday, the academy hosted a meeting at his home because official Soviet anti-religious activity was intense at the time and the official policy of the Bolshevik government, with its Soviet anti-religious legislation, strongly promoted state atheism.

In 1920, Berdiaev became professor of philosophy at the University of Moscow. In the same year, he was accused of participating in a conspiracy against the government; he was arrested and jailed. 
Felix Dzerzhinsky, the feared head of the Cheka, personally interrogated him, and he gave his interrogator a solid dressing down on the problems with Bolshevism. Novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his book &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; recounts the incident as follows:

[Berdyaev] was arrested twice; he was taken in 1922 for a midnight interrogation with Dzerjinsky; Kamenev was also there... But Berdyaev did not humiliate himself, he did not beg, he firmly professed the moral and religious principles by virtue of which he did not adhere to the party in power; and not only did they judge that there was no point in putting him on trial, but he was freed. Now there is a man who had a &quot;point of view&quot;!
After his expulsion from the USSR on September 29, 1922, on the so—called &quot;Philosophers&#x27; ships&quot;, Berdyaev and other émigrés went to Berlin, where he founded an academy of philosophy and religion, but economic and political conditions in the Weimar Republic caused him and his wife to move to Paris in 1923. He transferred his academy there, and taught, lectured and wrote, working for an exchange of ideas with the French and European intellectual community, and participated in a number of international conferences.


==Philosophical work==
According to Marko Markovic, Berdyaev &quot;was an ardent man, rebellious to all authority, an independent and &quot;negative&quot; spirit. He could assert himself only in negation and could not hear any assertion without immediately negating it, to such an extent that he would even be able to contradict himself and to attack people who shared his own prior opinions&quot;. According to Marina Makienko, Anna Panamaryova, and Andrey Gurban, Berdyaev&#x27;s works are &quot;emotional, controversial, bombastic, affective and dogmatic&quot;. They summarise that, according to Berdyaev, &quot;man unites two worlds – the world of the divine and the natural world. ... Through the freedom and creativity the two natures must unite... To overcome the dualism of existence is possible only through creativity.

David Bonner Richardson described Berdyaev&#x27;s philosophy as Christian existentialism and personalism. Other authors, such as political theologian Tsoncho Tsonchev, interpret Berdyaev as &quot;communitarian personalist&quot; and Slavophile. According to Tsonchev, Berdyaev&#x27;s philosophical thought rests on four &quot;pillars&quot;: freedom, creativity, person, and communion.

One of the central themes of Berdyaev&#x27;s work was philosophy of love. At first he systematically developed his theory of love in a special article published in the journal &quot;Pereval&quot; () in 1907. Then he gave gender issues a notable place in his book &quot;The Meaning of the Creative Act&quot; (1916). According to him, 1) erotic energy is an eternal source of creativity, 2) eroticism is linked to beauty, and eros means search for the beautiful.

He also published works about Russian history and the Russian national character. In particular, he wrote about Russian nationalism:
Though sometimes quoted as a Christian anarchist for his emphasis on theology and critique of statist and Marxist socialism, Berdyaev did not self-identify as such and differentiated himself from Leo Tolstoy.

Nikolai Berdyaev&#x27;s work is also featured in the dedication of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

==Theology and relations with Russian Orthodox Church==
Berdyaev was a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, and believed Orthodoxy was the religious tradition closest to early Christianity.

Nicholas Berdyaev was an Orthodox Christian, however, it must be said that he was an independent and somewhat a &quot;liberal&quot; kind. Berdyaev also criticized the Russian Orthodox Church and described his views as anticlerical. Yet he considered himself closer to Orthodoxy than either Catholicism or Protestantism. According to him, &quot;I can not call myself a typical Orthodox of any kind; but Orthodoxy was near to me (and I hope I am nearer to Orthodoxy) than either Catholicism or Protestantism. I never severed my link with the Orthodox Church, although confessional self-satisfaction and exclusiveness are alien to me.&quot;

Berdyaev is frequently presented as one of the important Russian Orthodox thinkers of the 20th century. However, neopatristic scholars such as Florovsky have questioned whether his philosophy is essentially Orthodox in character, and emphasize his western influences. But Florovsky was savaged in a 1937 Journal Put&#x27; article by Berdyaev. Paul Valliere has pointed out the sociological factors and global trends which have shaped the Neopatristic movement, and questions their claim that Berdyaev and Vladimir Solovyov are somehow less authentically Orthodox.

Berdyaev affirmed universal salvation, as did several other important Orthodox theologians of the 20th century. Along with Sergei Bulgakov, he was instrumental in bringing renewed attention to the Orthodox doctrine of apokatastasis, which had largely been neglected since it was expounded by Maximus the Confessor in the seventh century, although he rejected Origen&#x27;s articulation of this doctrine.

The aftermath of the Russian Revolution and Civil War, along with Soviet efforts towards the separation of church and state, caused the Russian Orthodox émigré diaspora to splinter into three Russian Church jurisdictions: the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (separated from Moscow Patriarchate until 2007), the parishes under Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgiyevsky) that went under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and parishes that remained under the Moscow Patriarchate. Berdyaev was among those that chose to remain under the omophorion of the Moscow Patriarchate. He is mentioned by name on the Korsun/Chersonese Diocesan history as among those noted figures who supported the Moscow Patriarchate West-European Eparchy (in France now Korsun eparchy).

Currently, the house in Clamart in which Berdyaev lived, now comprises a small &quot;Berdiaev-museum&quot; and attached Chapel in name of the Holy Spirit, under the omophorion of the Moscow Patriarchate. On 24 March 2018, the 70th anniversary of Berdyaev&#x27;s death, the priest of the Chapel served panikhida-memorial prayer at the Diocesan cathedral for eternal memory of Berdyaev, and later that day the Diocesan bishop Nestor (Sirotenko) presided over prayer at the grave of Berdyaev.

==Works==

In 1901 Berdyaev opened his literary career so to speak by work on &quot;Subjectivism and Individualism in Social Philosophy&quot;. In it, he analyzed a movement then beginning in Imperial Russia that &quot;at the beginning of the twentieth-century Russian Marxism split up; the more cultured Russian Marxists went through a spiritual crisis and became founders of an idealist and religious movement, while the majority began to prepare the advent of Communism&quot;. He wrote &quot;over twenty books and dozens of articles.&quot;

<text>The Institute of International Law (French: Institut de Droit International) is an organization devoted to the study and development of international law, whose membership comprises the world&#x27;s leading public international lawyers. It was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1904.

==History==
The institute was founded by Gustave Moynier and Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns, together with 9 other renowned international lawyers, on 8 September 1873 in the &quot;Salle de l&#x27;Arsenal&quot; of the Ghent Town Hall in Belgium. The founders of 1873 were: 
* Pasquale Stanislao Mancini (from Rome), President; 
* Emile de Laveleye (from Liege); 
* Tobias Michael Carel Asser (from Amsterdam); 
* James Lorimer (from Edinburgh); 
* Wladimir Besobrassof (from Saint-Petersburg); 
* Gustave Moynier (from Geneva); 
* Jean Gaspar Bluntschli (from Heidelberg); 
* Augusto Pierantoni (from Naples); 
* Carlos Calvo (from Buenos Aires); 
* Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns (from Ghent); 
* David Dudley Field (from New York)

In addition, August von Bulmerincq (from Tartu) was invited to participate at the founding event, but could not attend since the invitation did not reach him in time. He was later however counted among the founding members.

=== 150 years anniversary ===
In September 2023, the &quot;Institut&quot; celebrated its 150 years anniversary on the occasion of the 81st session that took place in Angers, France. For the occasion, three French government ministers were invited to participate in the session and video messages from the President of France, Emmanuel Macron and the United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres were presented during the ceremony.
During this session, the &quot;Institut&quot; also launched a documentary film about the history of the organization. This documentary features many prominent international legal scholars as well as current judges at the International Court of Justice.

==Organization==
The Institute is a private body, made up of &quot;associates&quot;, &quot;members&quot;, and &quot;honorary members&quot;. The Statute stipulates that the number of members and associates under the age of 80 cannot be over 132. The members, elected every two years by the current members of the organization, are persons who have demonstrated notable scholarly work in the area of international law, and is restricted to those who are considered relatively free of political pressure. The organisation attempts to have members broadly distributed around the world.

The organisation holds biannual congresses for the study of international law as it currently exists, and passes resolutions proposing modifications to international law. It does not comment on specific disputes.

While its recommendations cover international law in its many forms, some of its resolutions particularly pertain to human rights law and peaceful dispute resolution. It was for that reason that the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize.

The organization remains active, with the latest congress held in Angers, France in August 2023. The location of the institute&#x27;s headquarters rotates according to the origin of the Secretary General. The current headquarters are at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.

Current members of the Institut include, prominent lawyers, legal academics, former ambassadors, judges of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

Recent resolutions from the organization cover many important areas such as universal jurisdiction, provisional measures, regime of wrecks, immunity, environment, use of force, etc.

The Institut publishes its Annuaire, containing the reports of the commissions, deliberations of the plenary sessions, and any resulting declarations and resolutions. The records of the administrative sessions including elections are also included in the Annuaire.

The Institut&#x27;s website houses an online library of information, including, but not limited to, declarations, resolutions, and some works in progress for future inclusion in the Annuaire.

<doc id="313354" wikidata="Q2873026" url="?curid=313354" title="Autoroutes of Quebec">
<text>The Quebec Autoroute System or le système d&#x27;autoroute au Québec is a network of freeways within the province of Quebec, Canada, operating under the same principle of controlled access as the Interstate Highway System in the United States and the 400-series highways in neighbouring Ontario. The Autoroutes are the backbone of Quebec&#x27;s highway system, spanning almost . The speed limit on the Autoroutes is generally in rural areas and in urban areas; most roads are made of asphalt concrete.

The word &quot;autoroute&quot; is a blend of &quot;auto&quot; and &quot;route&quot;, equivalent to &quot;freeway&quot; or &quot;motorway&quot; in English, and it became the equivalent of &quot;expressway&quot; in French. In the 1950s, when the first Autoroutes were being planned, the design documents called them &quot;autostrades&quot; from the Italian word &quot;autostrada&quot;.

==Signage==

Autoroutes are identified by blue-and-red shields, similar to the American Interstate system. The red header of the shield contains a white image representing a highway overpass, and the blue lower portion of the shield contains the Autoroute&#x27;s number in white, along with a fleur-de-lis, which is a provincial symbol of Quebec.

Most Autoroute and road traffic signs in the province are in French, though English is also used on federally-financed or -owned routes, such as the Bonaventure Expressway in Montreal. To surmount the language barrier, however, most signs in Quebec use pictograms and text is avoided in most cases, with the exceptions usually only being the names of control cities. Other exceptions that are posted in both languages is the illegal use of radar detectors when entering the province that reads &quot;DÉTECTEURS DE RADAR INTERDITS/RADAR DETECTORS PROHIBITED&quot;, as well as areas where roads can be slippery due to melting ice and snow, marked &quot;DEGEL/THAW&quot;.

==Numbering system==

Autoroutes are divided into three types – principal routes, deviation routes, and collector routes – and are laid out and numbered in a fashion similar to the Interstate Highway System in the United States. The principal Autoroutes are the major highways of the province, and have single- or double-digit numbers. East-west Autoroutes running parallel to the Saint Lawrence River (for example, Autoroute 20 and Autoroute 40) are assigned even numbers, while north-south Autoroutes running perpendicular to the Saint Lawrence (such as Autoroute 5 and Autoroute 15) are given odd numbers. Deviation and collector Autoroutes both feature triple-digit numbers. Deviation routes are bypasses intended for truck traffic to circumvent urban areas, and are identified by an even number prefixing the number of the nearby Autoroute that it bypasses (for example, Autoroute 440 in Laval). Collector Autoroutes, by contrast, are spur routes into urban areas, and are identified by an odd number prefixing the number of the nearby Autoroute that it branches off of (such as Autoroute 720, a spur of Autoroute 20 into downtown Montreal).

==History==
Quebec&#x27;s first Autoroute was the &quot;Autoroute des Laurentides&quot; (Laurentian Autoroute), which opened in 1959 as a toll road. This initiative to bring freeways into Quebec was started by Maurice Duplessis, whose government saw the construction of the Laurentian Autoroute (now A-15) from Montreal to Saint-Jérôme and the first section of the Boulevard Métropolitain (A-40), which opened in 1960.

===1960s===

It was the Quebec Liberal government of the 1960s that saw the construction of further Autoroutes, with a grid numbering system and the introduction of the blue and red shield. The sign is inspired by the American Interstate sign. This was especially needed in light of the fact that many visitors would be flocking to Montreal by car for Expo 67. Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Autoroute Décarie&quot; (A-15) and the Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge–Tunnel were constructed for that very reason. The &quot;Autoroute des Cantons-de-l&#x27;Est&quot; (Eastern Townships Autoroute - A-10) opened in 1964, and its continuation, A-55 between Magog and Rock Island, opened in 1967, connecting with Interstate 91. What are now the A-20 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway) and the A-15 to New York (connecting with Interstate 87), originally built in the 1940s, were upgraded to expressway standards. The A-20 also connects with Highway 401 in Ontario. A-40 was extended out to Berthierville, and later to Trois-Rivières in the 1970s. Others include Autoroutes 25, 30 (southern beltway), 31, 35 (eventually connecting to Interstate 89), &quot;Autoroute Laurentienne&quot; (73), and 640 (an unfinished proposed northern beltway).

===1970s===

The 1970s also saw the completion of the Pierre Laporte Bridge in Quebec City, connecting the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River to the north. In addition to this, the A-73 was extended to Beauce, the A-20 was extended to Rivière-du-Loup, and the Chomedey Autoroute (A-13), the A-19 and the A-440 were constructed in Laval. Autoroutes were built (two sections of A-440, and A-740) and a few more planned in the Quebec City region, creating a dense web, which led to significant sprawl. In 1976, the Parti Québécois came to power, whose platform mandated an expansion of public transportation over the construction of more Autoroutes. Existing Autoroutes were extended (e.g., the A-40 was extended from Trois-Rivières to Quebec City) but no new Autoroutes were built.

The Autoroute des Laurentides, the Autoroute des Cantons-de-l&#x27;Est, the Autoroute de la Rive-Nord (North Shore Autoroute), and the A-13 were toll roads until the mid-1980s, when the toll barriers were removed and the province stopped collecting tolls from vehicles using the Autoroutes. The last toll booth was on the Champlain Bridge (A-10,A-15 and A-20). It was removed in 1990 because the Champlain Bridge is federal property and is thus not subject to provincial tolls.

===2000s===
In the 2000s, there were several high-profile failures and collapses around some Autoroutes, due to aging and crumbling infrastructure, including the Boulevard du Souvenir overpass collapse, De la Concorde overpass collapse, and most recently the Ville-Marie tunnel collapse. An online poll by Léger Marketing conducted shortly after the Viger tunnel collapse found that 88 percent of Montrealers are &quot;worried&quot; about the state of roads, bridges and tunnels in the city, with more than half of respondents saying they are downright &quot;scared&quot; to drive under an overpass (58 percent), on a bridge (54 per cent), or through a tunnel (53 per cent). McGill University&#x27;s Saeed Mirza stated that ill-advised design choices and poor-quality concrete were used in the construction rush ahead of Expo &#x27;67 and the 1976 Olympics. In particular, the concrete used was permeable with lack of proper drainage, and these allowed chlorides from de-icing salts to corrode the steel reinforcements.

<doc id="313356" wikidata="Q1394282" url="?curid=313356" title="Order of the Falcon">
<text>The Order of the Falcon () is the only order of chivalry in Iceland, founded by King Christian X of Denmark and Iceland on 3 July 1921. The award is awarded for merit for Iceland and humanity and has five degrees. Nowadays, appointments are made on the nomination of the President of Iceland and that of a &quot;five-member council.&quot;

==History and appointments==
Christian X, the King of Denmark, ruled Iceland until 17 June 1944. During his royal visit to Iceland in 1921, King Christian X issued the royal decree founding the Icelandic Order of the Falcon. When Iceland became a republic, new statutes were incorporated for the Order on 11 July 1944. The Republic of Iceland replaced the King by an elected President of Iceland who is the designated Grand Master of this Order. It may be awarded to both Icelanders and citizens of other countries for achievements in Iceland or internationally. A five-member council makes recommendations on awards to the Grand Master, who then grants the award. However, the Grand Master may award the Order without recommendations from the Order Council. The Grand Master and the Chairman of the Order Council then sign the Letters Patent, which are presented to the awards&#x27;s recipients.

==Classes==
The Order has five classes:

# Collar with Grand Cross Breast Star (&quot;Keðja ásamt stórkrossstjörnu&quot;), only for heads of state
# Grand Cross (&quot;Stórkross&quot;)
# Grand Knight&#x27;s Cross with Star (&quot;Stórriddarakross með stjörnu&quot;)
# Grand Knight&#x27;s Cross (&quot;Stórriddarakross&quot;)
# Knight&#x27;s Cross (&quot;Riddarakross&quot;)

==Insignia==

The &quot;collar&quot; is gilded metal; it consists of links bearing the Icelandic coat-of-arms and blue-enamelled discs bearing the white falcon.

The &quot;badge&quot; consists of a gilt cross, enamelled in white, with a blue-enamelled central disc bearing the white falcon.

The &quot;star&quot; is a silver, eight-pointed star. For the Grand Cross class it has the badge of the Order superimposed upon it. For the Grand Knight with Star class it has a blue-enamelled central disc bearing the white falcon.

The &quot;ribbon&quot; is blue with white-red-white border stripes. It is worn on the left shoulder.

In summary: 
* Collar with Grand Cross Breast Star – wears the badge on a collar plus a star on the left chest;
* Grand Cross – wears the badge on a sash on the left shoulder, plus a star on the left chest;
* Grand Knight&#x27;s Cross with Star – wears the badge on a necklet, plus a star on the left chest;
* Grand Knight&#x27;s Cross – wears the badge on a necklet;
* Knight&#x27;s Cross – wears the badge on a chest ribbon.

If a holder is promoted to a higher rank, the lower rank&#x27;s insignia must be returned. The insignia are retained during the recipient&#x27;s lifetime, but they must be returned to the Icelandic Government upon the recipient&#x27;s death.

<doc id="313358" wikidata="Q501672" url="?curid=313358" title="Kenpō">
<text>is the name of several martial arts. This term is often informally transliterated as &quot;kempo&quot;, as a result of applying Traditional Hepburn romanization, but failing to use a macron to indicate the long vowel. The word Kenpō translates to &quot;Fist Method&quot; (as with &quot;quanfa&quot;): &quot;ken&quot; meaning &quot;fist&quot; and &quot;po&quot; meaning &quot;method/law&quot;. The generic nature of the term combined with its widespread, cross-cultural adoption in the martial arts community has led to many divergent definitions.

==Shorinji Kenpo==

 is claimed to be a modified version of Shaolin Kung Fu (using the same kanji). It was established in 1947 by , a Japanese martial artist and former military intelligence agent, who combined his quanfa and jujutsu practice.

==Nippon Kenpo==

&quot;Nippon Kempo (日本拳法)&quot; was created by Muneomi Sawayama in 1932. Sawayama was a judoka who had studied under Kenwa Mabuni, a karateka who would establish the Shito-Ryu school of Karate. It is typically practised wearing protective gear (face, body, crotch, etc.) and gloves and allows full use of stand-up striking, throwing, and ground fighting.

==Okinawan Kenpo==
Some Okinawan martial arts groups use the term kenpō as an alternate name for their karate systems or for a distinct but related art within their association. This can be illustrated by the official full name of Motobu-ryu style named as &quot;Nihon Denryu Heiho Motobu Kenpo&quot; (&quot;Japan&#x27;s traditional tactics Motobu Kenpo&quot;) and by the International Shorin-ryu Karate Kobudo Federation, where Shōrin-ryū is the actual karate style practiced, whereas &quot;hakutsuru kenpo&quot;, or &quot;hakutsuru kenpo karate&quot; is a related but distinctive style also taught by the association. Both the &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; romanizations are used by various groups.

==American Kenpo==

Kenpo has also been used as a name for multiple martial arts that developed in Hawaii due to cross-cultural exchange between practitioners of Okinawan martial arts, Chinese martial arts, Filipino martial arts, and Japanese martial arts among other influences. In the United States, kenpo is often referred to as &quot;Kenpo Karate&quot;. The most widespread styles have their origin in the teachings of James Mitose and William Kwai Sun Chow. Mitose spent most of his early years training in Japan learning his family style, Kosho-Ryū (&quot;Old pine tree school&quot;). James Mitose would later bring that style to Hawaii where he would teach Chow, who would go on to instruct Ed Parker and Bobby Lowe. The system of kenpo taught by Mitose employed hard linear strikes and kicks, pressure point manipulation, circular movement patterns, and joint locking and breaking.

Parker is the most prominent name in the Mitose lineage. A student of Chow in Hawaii for nearly six years, Parker moved to the US mainland to attend Brigham Young University. In 1957, he began teaching the kenpo that he had learned from Chow, and throughout his life modified and refined the art until it became Ed Parker&#x27;s American Kenpo. It employs a blend of circular movements and hard linear movements. Parker created techniques with names such as &quot;Thundering Hammers&quot;, &quot;Five Swords&quot;, &quot;Prance Of The Tiger&quot;, and &quot;Flashing Mace&quot; to provide a memorisation tool to the student.

<doc id="313360" wikidata="Q1425626" url="?curid=313360" title="Klangfarbenmelodie">
<text>Klangfarbenmelodie (German for &quot;sound-color melody&quot;) is a musical concept that treats timbre as a melodic element. Arnold Schoenberg originated the idea. It has become synonymous with the technique of fragmenting a melodic line between different timbres.

==Origins==
Late in the 19th century, a sophisticated treatment of musical timbre started to emerge in works like Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;. During the same period, Hermann von Helmholtz theorized that timbre is part of what enables a listener to perceive melody.

In 1911, Arnold Schoenberg analyzed musical sound (&quot;klang&quot;) as consisting of pitch (&quot;höhe&quot;), timbre (&quot;farbe&quot;), and volume (&quot;stärke&quot;). He noted that pitch was the only element that had undergone close examination, but he viewed it as subordinate to timbre, &quot;...tone becomes perceptible by virtue of tone color, of which one dimension is pitch&quot;. He looked forward to a more sophisticated appreciation of tone color. Schoenberg also described a &quot;futuristic fantasy&quot; of tone color &quot;progressions whose relations with another work with a kind of logic entirely equivalent to that logic which satisfies us in the melody of pitches&quot;. He rhapsodized:Tone-color melodies! How acute the senses that would be able to perceive them! How high the development of spirit that could find pleasure in such subtle things!

In its original sense, Schoenberg envisioned &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot; as a sequence of tone colors. There could be just one pitch, but the changing timbres are what create the semblance of melody. Because Schoenberg never clearly defined the term, it was widely misunderstood. There remains no clear definition of the term.

In 1951, Schoenberg felt compelled to revisit the concept in two short writings. One was an essay about Anton Webern&#x27;s use of &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot;. He balked at Webern&#x27;s use of traditional form schemes while using the technique. Just as melody and counterpoint gave birth to unique forms, Schoenberg believed that &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot; would require new forms that suited their nature.

Schoenberg also dispatched duplicate letters to Luigi Dallapiccola and Josef Rufer on January 19, 1951. He asked them to only reveal the missives if his invention of &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot; were ever doubted. The letter also expands on the concept by explaining the &quot;klänge&quot; in question could be entire passages of music that would be modulated by tone color. He specifically pointed to three examples from his catalogue: &quot;the tomb scene of &quot;Pelleas und Melisande&quot;, or much of the introduction to the fourth movement of my second String Quartet, or the fugue figure from the second Piano Piece...They are never merely individual tones of different instruments at different times, but rather combinations of moving voices.&quot;

Schoenberg explored &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot; in &quot;Five Orchestral Pieces&quot; op. 16 (1909). The third piece in the suite is titled &quot;Farben&quot;. It features a standing chord that is translated into a klangfarbenmelodie through the restless orchestration. Alban Berg used this technique in the first of his &quot;Altenberg Lieder&quot;.

This original sense of &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot; has its most direct descendants in the practitioners of spectral music, which prizes timbre as a structural element.

==Melodic Version==
The more familiar meaning of &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot; is when a melodic line is fragmented between different timbres. There are many historical precedents to the concept. In practice, composers are writing in hocket when they deploy &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot;. The technique can also be found in polyphonic precedents like Annibale Padovano&#x27;s treatment of the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; in his music. 

Anton Webern used this pointillistic technique extensively. A classic example is the opening melodic statement of his &quot;Fünf Stücke für Orchester&quot; Op. 10 (1913) which requires the efforts of the flute, trumpet, celeste, harp, glockenspiel, viola, and clarinet often playing just one note each. In Webern&#x27;s hocketization of Schoenberg&#x27;s concept, timbres are often mixed but not combined. The effect creates a sense of a compound melody, where the pitch content moves more swiftly than the timbres. The music feels contrapuntally dense while it is in fact quite sparse. In Schoenberg&#x27;s 1951 letter, he wrote, &quot;My conception of &quot;Klangfarbenmelodie&quot; would have been fulfilled in Webern’s compositions only in the slightest part.&quot; He felt that Webern&#x27;s understanding of the concept was an error. The impetus for Schoenberg&#x27;s letter was partially to reclaim ownership of the concept which had become so synonymous with his pupil&#x27;s work.

In fact, Webern was employing the concept in pieces like &quot;Sechs Stücke&quot; op. 6 (1909) before Schoenberg wrote about it. The first movement of Webern&#x27;s &quot;Symphony&quot; op. 21 offers an archetypal example of &quot;klangfarbenmelodie&quot;, where nearly every pitch is colored by a different instrument. In Webern&#x27;s usage, &quot;klangenfarbenmelodie&quot; articulates the motivic structure of a piece. This is especially evident in his orchestration of the six-part &quot;ricercar&quot; from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Musical Offering&quot;. 

Webern&#x27;s preoccupation with &quot;klangenfarbenmelodie&quot; continues through his seminal &quot;Concerto for Nine Instruments&quot; op. 24 (1934). It became a landmark in the development of serial music. Serialism was a continuation of the Second Viennese School&#x27;s innovations. Composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen systematized musical parameters like pitch, rhythm, and timbre. &quot;Klangfarbenmelodie&quot; was particularly influential in the development of electronic music.

<text>A rip current (or just rip) is a specific type of water current that can occur near beaches where waves break. A rip is a strong, localized, and narrow current of water that moves directly away from the shore by cutting through the lines of breaking waves, like a river flowing out to sea. The force of the current in a rip is strongest and fastest next to the surface of the water.

Rip currents can be hazardous to people in the water. Swimmers who are caught in a rip current and who do not understand what is happening, or who may not have the necessary water skills, may panic, or they may exhaust themselves by trying to swim directly against the flow of water. Because of these factors, rip currents are the leading cause of rescues by lifeguards at beaches. In the United States they cause an average of 71 deaths by drowning per year .

A rip current is not the same thing as undertow, although some people use that term incorrectly when they are talking about a rip current. Contrary to popular belief, neither rip nor undertow can pull a person down and hold them under the water. A rip simply carries floating objects, including people, out to just beyond the zone of the breaking waves, at which point the current dissipates and releases everything it is carrying.

==Causes and occurrence==
A rip current forms because wind and breaking waves push surface water towards the land. This causes a slight rise in the water level along the shore. This excess water will tend to flow back to the open water via the route of least resistance. When there is a local area which is slightly deeper, such as a break in an offshore sand bar or reef, this can allow water to flow offshore more easily, and this will initiate a rip current through that gap.

Water that has been pushed up near the beach flows along the shore towards the outgoing rip as &quot;feeder currents&quot;. The excess water flows out at a right angle to the beach, in a tight current called the &quot;neck&quot; of the rip. The &quot;neck&quot; is where the flow is most rapid. When the water in the rip current reaches outside of the lines of breaking waves, the flow disperses sideways, loses power, and dissipates in what is known as the &quot;head&quot; of the rip.

Rip currents can form by the coasts of oceans, seas, and large lakes, whenever there are waves of sufficient energy. Rip currents often occur on a gradually shelving shore, where breaking waves approach the shore parallel to it, or where underwater topography encourages outflow at one specific area. Baïnes are one of the patterns identified to be producing rip currents. The location of rip currents can be difficult to predict. Some tend to recur always in the same places, but others can appear and disappear suddenly at various locations along the beach. The appearance and disappearance of rip currents is dependent upon the bottom topography and the direction from which the surf and swells are coming.

Rip currents occur wherever there is strong longshore variability in wave breaking. This variability may be caused by such features as sandbars, by piers and jetties, and even by crossing wave trains. They are often located in places where there is a gap in a reef, or low area on a sandbar. Rip currents, once they have formed, may deepen the channel through a sandbar.

Rip currents are usually quite narrow, but they tend to be more common, wider, and faster, when and where breaking waves are large and powerful. Local underwater topography makes some beaches more likely to have rip currents. A few beaches are notorious in this respect.

Although &quot;rip tide&quot; is a misnomer, in areas of significant tidal range, rip currents may only occur at certain stages of the tide, when the water is shallow enough to cause the waves to break over a sand bar, but deep enough for the broken wave to flow over the bar. In parts of the world with a big difference between high tide and low tide, and where the shoreline shelves gently, the distance between a bar and the shoreline may vary from a few meters to a kilometer or more, depending whether it is high tide or low tide.

A fairly common misconception is that rip currents can pull a swimmer down, under the surface of the water. This is not true, and in reality a rip current is strongest close to the surface, as the flow near the bottom is slowed by friction.

The surface of a rip current can often appear to be a relatively smooth area of water, without any breaking waves, and this deceptive appearance may cause some beach-goers to believe that it is a suitable place to enter the water.

===Technical description===
A more detailed and technical description of rip currents requires understanding the concept of radiation stress. Radiation stress is the force (or momentum flux) that is exerted on the water column by the presence of the wave. When a wave reaches shallow water and shoals, it increases in height prior to breaking. During this increase in height, radiation stress increases, because of the force exerted by the weight of the water that has been pushed upwards. 

To balance this, the local mean surface level drops. This is known as the &quot;setdown&quot;. When the wave breaks and starts reducing in height, the radiation stress decreases as the amount of water that is elevated decreases. When this happens, the mean surface level increases — this is known as the &quot;setup&quot;.

In the formation of a rip current, a wave propagates over a sandbar with a gap in it. When this happens, most of the wave breaks on the sandbar, leading to &quot;setup&quot;. The part of the wave that propagates over the gap does not break, and the &quot;setdown&quot; continues in that part. Because of this phenomenon, the mean water surface over the rest of the sandbar is higher than that which is over the gap. The result is a strong flow outward through the gap. This strong flow is the rip current.

The vorticity and inertia of rip currents have been studied. From a model of the vorticity of a rip current done at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that as a fast rip current extends away from shallow water, the vorticity of the current increases, and the width of the current decreases. This model acknowledges that friction plays a role and waves are irregular in nature. From data from Sector-Scanning Doppler Sonar at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that rip currents in La Jolla, California, lasted several minutes, that they reoccurred one to four times per hour, and that they created a wedge with a 45° arch and a radius of 200–400 meters.

==Visible characteristics==
Rip currents have a characteristic appearance, and, with some experience, they can be visually identified from the shore before entering the water. This is helpful to lifeguards, swimmers, surfers, boaters, divers and other water users, who may need to avoid a rip, or in some cases make use of the flow.

Rip currents often look somewhat like a road or river running straight out to sea. They are easiest to notice and identify when the zone of breaking waves is viewed from a high vantage point. The following are some visual characteristics that can be used to identify a rip:

* A noticeable break in the pattern of the waves — the water often looks flat at the rip, in contrast to the lines of breaking waves on either side of the rip.
* A &quot;river&quot; of foam — the surface of the rip sometimes looks foamy, because the current is carrying foam from the surf out to open water.
* Different color — the rip may differ in color from the surrounding water. It is often more opaque, cloudier, or muddier, and so, depending on the angle of the sun, the rip may show as darker or lighter than the surrounding water.
* It is sometimes possible to see that foam or floating debris on the surface of the rip is moving out, away from the shore. In contrast, in the surrounding areas of breaking waves, floating objects and foam are being pushed towards the shore.

These characteristics are helpful in learning to recognize and understand the nature of rip currents. Learning these signs can enable a person to recognize the presence and position of rips before entering the water, which is an important skill as studies show the majority of people are unable to identify a rip current and therefore unable to identify safe places to swim.

In the United States, some beaches have signs created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and United States Lifesaving Association, explaining what a rip current is and how to escape one. These signs are titled, &quot;Rip Currents; Break the Grip of the Rip&quot;. Two of these signs are shown in the image at the top of this article. Beachgoers can get information from lifeguards, who are always watching for rip currents, and who will move their safety flags so that swimmers can avoid rips.

==Danger to swimmers==

Rip currents are a potential source of danger for people in shallow water with breaking waves, whether this is in seas, oceans or large lakes. Rip currents are the proximate cause of 80% of rescues carried out by beach lifeguards.

Rip currents typically flow at about . They can be as fast as , which is faster than any human can swim. Most rip currents are fairly narrow, and even the widest rip currents are not very wide. Swimmers can usually exit the rip easily by swimming at a right angle to the flow, parallel to the beach. Swimmers who are unaware of this fact may exhaust themselves trying unsuccessfully to swim directly against the flow. The flow of the current fades out completely at the head of the rip, outside the zone of the breaking waves, so there is a definite limit to how far the swimmer will be taken out to sea by the flow of a rip current.

In a rip current, death by drowning occurs when a person has limited water skills and panics, or when a swimmer persists in trying to swim to shore against a strong rip current, and eventually becomes exhausted and drowns.

According to the NOAA rip currents caused an average of 71 deaths annually in the United States over the ten years ending in 2022 (with 69 in 2022).

A 2013 Australian study found that rips killed more people in Australia than bushfires, floods, cyclones and shark attacks combined.

===Survival===
People caught in a rip current may notice that they are moving away from the shore quite rapidly. Often, it is not possible to swim directly back to shore against a rip current, so this is not recommended. Contrary to popular misunderstanding, a rip does not pull a swimmer under the water. It carries the swimmer away from the shore in a narrow band of moving water.

A rip current is like a moving treadmill, which the swimmer can get out of quite easily by swimming at a right angle, across the current, i.e. parallel to the shore in either direction. Rip currents are usually not very wide, so getting out of one only takes a few strokes. Once out of the rip current, getting back to shore is not difficult, since waves are breaking, and floating objects, including swimmers, will be pushed by the waves towards the shore.

As an alternative, people who are caught in a strong rip can simply relax, either floating or treading water, and allow the current to carry them until it dissipates completely once it is beyond the surf line. Then the person can signal for help, or swim back through the surf, doing so diagonally, away from the rip and towards the shore.

It is necessary for coastal swimmers to understand the danger of rip currents, to learn how to recognize them, and how to deal with them. And when possible, it is necessary that people enter the water only in areas where lifeguards are on duty.

In a planned trial in a large rip current at Muriwai Beach in New Zealand, an Australian researcher from the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, UNSW Sydney found that &quot;just swim to the side&quot; would not work as the rip current was too wide to see its sides, and said that, despite a rescue boat being near, he was unable to relax and not panic. The current took him 300 metres along the beach in a channel feeding the rip current, and then 400 metres offshore at &quot;speeds approaching those of swimming world records&quot;.

==Uses==
Experienced and knowledgeable water users, including surfers, body boarders, divers, surf lifesavers and kayakers, when they wish to get out beyond the breaking waves, will sometimes use a rip current as a rapid and effortless means of transportation.

<text>A rip tide, or riptide, is a strong offshore current that is caused by the tide pulling water through an inlet along a barrier beach, at a lagoon or inland marina where tide water flows steadily out to sea during ebb tide. It is a strong tidal flow of water within estuaries and other enclosed tidal areas. The riptides become the strongest where the flow is constricted. When there is a falling or ebbing tide, the outflow water is strongly flowing through an inlet toward the sea, especially once stabilised by jetties.

== Dynamics ==
During these falling and ebbing tides, a riptide can carry a person far offshore. For example, the ebbing tide at Shinnecock Inlet in Southampton, New York, extends more than offshore. Because of this, riptides are typically more powerful than rip currents.

During slack tide, the water is motionless for a short period of time until the flooding or rising tide starts pushing the sea water landward through the inlet. Riptides also occur at constricted areas in bays and lagoons where there are no waves near an inlet.

These strong, reversing currents can also be termed ebb jets, flood jet, or tidal jets by coastal engineers because they carry large quantities of sand outward that form sandbars far out in the ocean or into the bay outside the inlet channel. The term &quot;ebb jet&quot; would be used for a tidal current leaving an enclosed tidal area, and &quot;flood jet&quot; for the equivalent tidal current entering it.

== Rip tide and rip currents ==
The term &quot;rip tide&quot; is often incorrectly used to refer to rip currents, which are not tidal flows. A rip current is a strong, narrow jet of water that moves away from the beach and into the ocean as a result of local wave motion. Rip currents can flow quickly, are unpredictable, and come about from what happens to waves as they interact with the shape of the sea bed. In contrast, a rip tide is caused by tidal movements, as opposed to wave action, and is a predictable rise and fall of the water level.

The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration comments:

Rip currents are not rip tides. A specific type of current associated with tides may include both the ebb and flood tidal currents that are caused by egress and ingress of the tide through inlets and the mouths of estuaries, embayments, and harbors. These currents may cause drowning deaths, but these tidal currents or tidal jets are separate and distinct phenomena from rip currents. Recommended terms for these phenomena include ebb jet, flood jet, or tidal jet.

== Surviving rip currents ==
People often drown by swimming directly against a rip current, which tires them out. People are advised to not fight the current, which is too strong for any swimmer. People should not try to swim directly inwards, towards the beach. They should relax, and swim parallel to the beach. Eventually, they will be out of the rip current.

<text>Disperse was a Christian rock band from Southern Indiana active from 1996 to 2004. The band was formerly known, with an adjusted roster, as &quot;Stuff.&quot;

==Members (as of 2004 dispersion)==
:Chelsey Pieratt - Vocals
:Chris Billings - Lead Guitar
:Andy Higham - Rhythm Guitar
:Nic Higham - Bass Guitar
:Dustin Sanders - Drums, Percussion

==Former members==
:Regina Mullikan - Lead Vocals (2000-2001)
:Amber Hillen - Keyboards (1997 - 1999)
:Erin Davidson - Backing Vocals (1997 - 1999)

==History==
Formed in early 1996 under the name of &quot;Stuff,&quot; the band consisted of members Chelsey Pieratt, Chris Billings, brothers Andy and Nic Higham, and Dustin Sanders, all members of a Christian youth group who wanted to promote their faith through their various musical talents. Under the guidance of the youth minister at their local church, the band began to play at a nearby Christian coffeehouse called the Solid Rock Cafe as an opening act for more notable bands, including Satellite Soul and Just Visiting (now known as the award-winning, world-renowned group The Elms.) Eventually the group began performing solo and headlining their own shows at the Solid Rock Cafe, as well as performing shows at various teen-oriented Christian clubs and coffeehouses across Southern Indiana. In the spring of 2000, because of personal conflict between the members of the band, coupled with tensions between the group and the church leadership that brought them together, the group canceled its upcoming gigs and declared an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; and Stuff stopped performing.

In fall of 2000, the group reformed (with lead singer Regina Mullikan replacing Pieratt) and began performing again, with an edgier, less conservative sound and lyrics that incorporated more adult topics, including suicide, teenage pregnancy, relationships, drug and alcohol abuse, and other obstacles encountered by teenagers and young adults growing up in the midwest United States. It was during this time they took the name Disperse, suggested by Andy for its literal meaning and the related imagery of &quot;spreading the word and the faith&quot;

Their newly matured sound and subject matter brought the band an increased amount of popularity and it was during this time that they began performing across Indiana. Once more they found themselves opening for bands like The Elms and Far From Home. However, less than a year after joining the band, Pieratt&#x27;s replacement Regina dropped out of the band because of creative differences, and Pieratt returned to the microphone.

Encouraged by this newfound success and the return of their original vocalist, the band released their debut CD &quot;Better place&quot; under the Route Seven Records label. The CD, containing 12 tracks, was a local success and bolstered the band&#x27;s popularity across the midwest. The CD, recorded at Paradise Studios in South Central Indiana, featured all original tracks as well as a re-imagined version of &quot;Amazing grace&quot; as a closer, with the hymn &quot;Blind man&quot; as a hidden track. The album was sold at both live shows and over internet distributors such as CDbaby.com.

After four more years of playing, Disperse amicably dispersed as each of the members went their separate ways, either to college or careers. The group has made available through internet distribution several of their recorded but as-yet unreleased tracks at no cost.

<doc id="313380" wikidata="Q201164" url="?curid=313380" title="William Sterndale Bennett">
<text>Sir William Sterndale Bennett (13 April 18161 February 1875) was an English composer, pianist, conductor and music educator. At the age of ten Bennett was admitted to the London Royal Academy of Music (RAM), where he remained for ten years. By the age of twenty, he had begun to make a reputation as a concert pianist, and his compositions received high praise. Among those impressed by Bennett was the German composer Felix Mendelssohn, who invited him to Leipzig. There Bennett became friendly with Robert Schumann, who shared Mendelssohn&#x27;s admiration for his compositions. Bennett spent three winters composing and performing in Leipzig.

In 1837 Bennett began to teach at the RAM, with which he was associated for most of the rest of his life. For twenty years he taught there, later also teaching at Queen&#x27;s College, London. Among his pupils during this period were Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, and Tobias Matthay. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onward, his career was punctuated by antagonism between himself and the conductor Michael Costa.

In 1858, Bennett returned to composition, but his later works, though popular, were considered old-fashioned and did not arouse as much critical enthusiasm as his youthful compositions had done. He was Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge from 1856 until 1875. In 1866 he became Principal of the RAM, rescuing it from closure, and remained in this position until his death. He was knighted in 1871. He died in London in 1875 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Bennett had a significant influence on English music, not solely as a composer but also as a teacher, as a promoter of standards of musical education and as an important figure in London concert life. In recent years, appreciation of Bennett&#x27;s compositions has been rekindled and a number of his works, including a symphony, his piano concerti, some vocal music and many of his piano compositions, have been recorded. In his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts of his music and other related events took place.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. 

John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King&#x27;s, St John&#x27;s and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King&#x27;s College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child&#x27;s talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.

Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather&#x27;s wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather&#x27;s agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Among the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman &quot;en travesti&quot;). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. &quot;The Observer&quot; wryly commented, &quot;of the page... we will not speak&quot;, but acknowledged that Bennett sang pleasingly and to the satisfaction of the audience. &quot;The Harmonicon&quot;, however, called his performance &quot;in every way a blot on the piece&quot;.

Among Bennett&#x27;s student compositions were a piano concerto (No. 1 in D minor, Op. 1), a symphony and an overture to &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The concerto received its public premiere at an orchestral concert in Cambridge on 28 November 1832, with Bennett as soloist. Performances soon followed in London and, by royal command, at Windsor Castle, where Bennett played in April 1833 for King William IV and Queen Adelaide. The RAM published the concerto at its own expense as a tribute. A further London performance was given in June 1833. The critic of &quot;The Harmonicon&quot; wrote of this concert:[T]he most complete and gratifying performance was that of young Bennett, whose composition would have conferred honour on any established master, and his execution of it was really surprising, not merely for its correctness and brilliancy, but for the feeling he manifested, which, if he proceed as he has begun, must in a few years place him very high in his profession.

In the audience was Felix Mendelssohn, who was sufficiently impressed to invite Bennett to the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Düsseldorf. Bennett asked, &quot;May I come to be your pupil?&quot; Mendelssohn replied, &quot;No, no. You must come to be my friend&quot;.

In 1834, Bennett was appointed organist of St Ann&#x27;s, Wandsworth, London, a chapel of ease to Wandsworth parish church. He held the post for a year, after which he taught private students in central London and at schools in Edmonton and Hendon. Although by common consent the RAM had little more to teach him after his seventh or eighth year, he was permitted to remain as a free boarder there until 1836, which suited him well, as his income was small. In May 1835 Bennett made his first appearance at the Philharmonic Society of London, playing the premiere of his Second Piano Concerto (in E-flat major, Op. 4), and in the following year he gave there the premiere of his Third Concerto (in C minor, Op. 9). Bennett was also a member of the Society of British Musicians, founded in 1834 to promote specifically British musicians and compositions. Davison wrote in 1834 that Bennett&#x27;s overture named for Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Parisina&quot; was &quot;the best thing that has been played at the Society&#x27;s concerts&quot;.

===Germany: Mendelssohn and Schumann (1836–42)===
In May 1836, Bennett travelled to Düsseldorf in the company of Davison to attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival for the first performance of Mendelssohn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;St Paul&quot;. Bennett&#x27;s visit was enabled by a subsidy by the piano-making firm of John Broadwood &amp; Sons. Inspired by his journey up the Rhine, Bennett began work on his overture &quot;The Naiads&quot; (Op. 15). After Bennett left for home, Mendelssohn wrote to their mutual friend, the English organist and composer Thomas Attwood, &quot;I think him the most promising young musician I know, not only in your country but also here, and I am convinced if he does not become a very great musician, it is not God&#x27;s will, but his own&quot;.

After Bennett&#x27;s first visit to Germany there followed three extended visits to work in Leipzig. He was there from October 1836 to June 1837, during which time he made his debut at the Gewandhaus as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn conducting. He later conducted his &quot;Naiads&quot; overture. During this visit he also arranged the first cricket match ever played in Germany, (&quot;as fitting a Yorkshireman&quot; as the musicologist Percy M. Young comments). At this time Bennett wrote to Davison:[Mendelssohn] took me to his house and gave me the printed score of [his overture] &#x27;Melusina&#x27;, and afterwards we supped at the &#x27;Hôtel de Bavière&#x27;, where all the musical clique feed ... The party consist[ed] of Mendelssohn, [Ferdinand] David, Stamity [sic] ... and a Mr. Schumann, a musical editor, who expected to see me a &quot;fat&quot; man with &quot;large black whiskers.&quot; 

Bennett had been at first slightly in awe of Mendelssohn, but no such formality ever attached to Bennett&#x27;s friendship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night. Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his &quot;Symphonic Studies&quot; to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication a few weeks later with his &quot;Fantasie&quot;, Op. 16. Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett&#x27;s music; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;, praising amongst other works Bennett&#x27;s Op. 10 &quot;Musical Sketches&quot; for piano, &quot;three of Bennett&#x27;s loveliest pictures&quot;. The essay ends: &quot;For some time now he has been peering over my shoulder, and for the second time he has asked &#x27;But what are you writing?&#x27; Dear friend, I shall write no more than: &#x27;If only you knew!&#x27;&quot; Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann&#x27;s music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought &quot;rather too eccentric&quot;.

On Bennett&#x27;s return to London he took up a teaching post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the &quot;Wood Nymphs&quot; Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, he wrote to his Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people are mad with [Sigismond] Thalberg and [Johann] Strauss [I], and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June. I sincerely hope that Prince Albert ... will do something to improve our taste.

On Bennett&#x27;s third trip, from January to March 1842, in which he also visited Kassel, Dresden and Berlin, he played his &quot;Caprice&quot; for piano and orchestra, Op. 22, in Leipzig. Despite his then-pessimistic view of music in England, Bennett missed his chance to establish himself in Germany. The musicologist Nicholas Temperley writes One might guess that the early loss of both parents produced in Bennett an exceptionally intense need for reassurance and encouragement. England could not provide this for a native composer in his time. He found it temporarily in German musical circles; yet, when the opportunity came to claim his earned place as a leader in German music, he was not quite bold enough to grasp it.

===Teacher and conductor (1842–49)===


Bennett returned to London in March 1842, and continued his teaching at the RAM. The next year the post of professor of music at the University of Edinburgh became vacant. With Mendelssohn&#x27;s strong encouragement Bennett applied for the position. Mendelssohn wrote to the principal of the university, &quot;I beg you to use your powerful influence on behalf of that candidate whom I consider in every respect worthy of the place, a true ornament to his art and his country, and indeed one of the best and most highly gifted musicians now living: Mr. Sterndale Bennett.&quot; Despite this advocacy Bennett&#x27;s application was unsuccessful.

Bennett had been impressed in Leipzig with the concept of chamber music concerts, which had been, apart from string quartet recitals, a rarity in London. He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including piano trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven, works for piano solo, and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the piano virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s pupil, the 13-year-old Carl Filtsch.

In 1844, Bennett married Mary Anne Wood (1824–1862), the daughter of a naval commander. Composition gave way to a ceaseless round of teaching and musical administration. The writer and composer Geoffrey Bush sees the marriage as marking a break in Bennett&#x27;s career; &quot;from 1844 to 1856 [Bennett] was a freelance teacher, conductor and concert organiser; a very occasional pianist and a still more occasional composer.&quot; Clara Schumann noted that Bennett spent too much time giving private lessons to keep up with changing trends in music: &quot;His only chance of learning new music is in the carriage on the way from one lesson to another.&quot; Among his pupils was the composer Alice Mary Smith.

From 1842, Bennett had been a director of the Philharmonic Society of London. He helped to relieve the society&#x27;s perilous finances by persuading Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society&#x27;s orchestra, attracting full houses and much-needed income. In 1842, the orchestra, under the composer&#x27;s baton, gave the London premiere of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Third (&quot;Scottish&quot;) Symphony, two months after its world premiere in Leipzig. In 1844, Mendelssohn conducted the last six concerts of the society&#x27;s season, in which among his own works and those of many others he included music by Bennett. From 1846 to 1854, the Society&#x27;s conductor was Michael Costa, of whom Bennett disapproved; Costa was too devoted to Italian opera and not a partisan of the German masters, as was Bennett. Bennett wrote to Mendelssohn on 24 July, displaying some querulousness, &quot;The Philharmonic Directors have engaged Costa ... with which I am not very well pleased, but I could not persuade them to the contrary, and am tired of quarrelling with them. They are a worse set this year than we have ever had.&quot;

In May 1848, on the opening of Queen&#x27;s College, London, Bennett, as one of the Founding Directors, delivered an inaugural lecture and joined the staff, while continuing his work at the RAM and private teaching. He wrote the thirty &quot;Preludes and Lessons&quot;, Op. 33, for his piano students at the college; they were published in 1853 and remained in widespread use by music students well into the twentieth century. In a profile of Bennett published in 1903, F. G. Edwards noted that Bennett&#x27;s duties as a teacher severely reduced his opportunity to compose, although he maintained his reputation as a soloist in annual chamber music and piano recitals at the Hanover Square Rooms, which included chamber music and concerti by Johann Sebastian Bach and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;An die ferne Geliebte&quot;, &quot;then almost novelties&quot;. Over the years he gave over forty concerts at this venue, and amongst those who took part were the violinists Henri Vieuxtemps and Heinrich Ernst, the pianists Stephen Heller, Ignaz Moscheles and Clara Schumann, and the cellist Carlo Piatti (for whom Bennett wrote his Sonata Duo); composers represented included—apart from Bennett&#x27;s favourite classical masters and Mendelssohn—Domenico Scarlatti, Fanny Mendelssohn and Schumann.

As well as the demands of his work as a teacher and pianist, there were other factors that may have contributed to Bennett&#x27;s long withdrawal from large-scale composition. Charles Villiers Stanford writes that the death of Mendelssohn in 1847 came to Bennett as &quot;an irreparable loss&quot;. The following year, Bennett severed his hitherto close ties with the Philharmonic Society, which had presented many of his most successful compositions. This break resulted from an initially minor disagreement with Costa over his interpretation at the final rehearsal of Bennett&#x27;s overture &quot;Parisina&quot;. The intransigence of both parties inflated this into a furious row, and began a breach between them which was to last throughout Bennett&#x27;s career. Bennett was disgusted at the Society&#x27;s failure to back him up, and resigned.

===Music professional (1849–66)===

From this point in his life Bennett was ever increasingly involved in the burdens of musical organization. In the opinion of Percy Young, he became &quot;the prototype of the modern administrative musician ... he eventually built for himself an impregnable position, but in doing so destroyed his once considerable creative talent.&quot; Bennett became a victim as well as a beneficiary of a trend towards professionalization in the music industry in Britain; &quot;The Principal and the Professor became powerful, whereas the status of the composer and the executant (unless foreign) was implicitly downgraded.&quot;

In 1849, Bennett became the founding president of the Bach Society in London, whose early members included Sir George Smart, John Pyke Hullah, William Horsley, Potter and Davison. Under his direction the Society gave the first English performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; on 6 April 1854. Further performances of the &quot;Passion&quot; were given by the Society in 1858 and 1862, the latter coinciding with the publication of Bennett&#x27;s own edition of the work, with a translation of the text into English by his pupil Helen Johnston.

For the 1851 Great Exhibition, Bennett was appointed a Metropolitan Local Commissioner, Musical Juror and superintendent for the music at the opening Royal ceremony.

In June 1853 Bennett made his last public appearance as a soloist with orchestra in his own Fourth Piano Concerto. This performance was given with a new organization, the Orchestral Union, and followed a snub from Costa, who had refused to conduct the pianist Arabella Goddard (Davison&#x27;s wife) in Bennett&#x27;s Third Concerto at the Philharmonic Society. In the same year Bennett declined an invitation to become the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He was greatly tempted by the offer, but felt it his duty to remain in England, as the offer came too late for Bennett to make alternative arrangements for some of his pupils, and he refused to let them down. After the controversial 1855 season of the Philharmonic Society at which Richard Wagner conducted, Bennett was elected to take over the conductorship in 1856, a post which he held for ten years. At his first concert, on 14 April 1856, the piano soloist in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto was Clara Schumann, wife of his old friend. It was her first appearance in England.

Bennett&#x27;s stewardship of the Philharmonic Society orchestra was not entirely happy, and the historian of the orchestra, Cyril Ehrlich, notes &quot;a sense of drift and decline&quot;. Many leading members of the orchestra were also in the orchestra of the Italian Opera House in London (and therefore partisans of the displaced Costa), and, in addition, Bennett proved unable to resolve personal animosities amongst his leading players. Costa took to arranging schedules for his musicians which made rehearsals (and sometimes performances) for the Society impractical. This gave an &quot;impression that [Bennett] was capable of exerting only waning authority amongst professionals&quot;. Moreover, comparing London with other centres around the mid-century, Ehrlich notes &quot;Verdi was in Milan, Wagner in Dresden, Meyerbeer in Paris, Brahms in Vienna, and Liszt in Weimar. London had the richest of audiences, and was offered Sterndale Bennett.&quot; He instances the London premiere of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Paradise and the Peri&quot; in the 1856 season, which, by engaging Jenny Lind as soloist, and with Prince Albert in the audience, brought in a substantial subscription, but was musically disastrous (and was not helped by the chaos of a seriously overcrowded venue). One member of the audience thought Lind&#x27;s voice was &quot;worn and strained&quot; and that there would have been &quot;vehement demonstrations of derision had not the audience been restrained in the presence of Royalty&quot;. Newspaper critics were scarcely more complimentary.

Temperley writes: &quot;After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence.&quot; 

Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, &quot;The May Queen&quot;, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an &quot;Installation Ode for Cambridge University&quot; (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata, &quot;The Woman of Samaria&quot; for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (&quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot;, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.

In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen&#x27;s College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting &quot;viva voce&quot; examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.

In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the heads of the Academy directors. Bennett resigned from the RAM at this overbearing behaviour, and was not to return until 1866. Towards the end of 1862 Bennett&#x27;s wife died after a painful illness. His biographer W. B. Squire suggests that &quot;he never recovered from the effects of Mrs. Bennett&#x27;s death, and that henceforward a painful change in him became apparent to his friends.&quot; In 1865, Bennett again visited Leipzig where he was reunited with old friends including Ferdinand David, and his Op. 43 Symphony was performed.

===Principal of Royal Academy of Music (1866–75)===

In 1866, Charles Lucas, the Principal of the RAM, announced his retirement. The position was first offered to Costa, who demanded a higher salary than the directors of the RAM could contemplate, and then to Otto Goldschmidt, who was then professor of piano at the RAM. He declined and urged the directors to appoint Bennett. Lind, who was Goldschmidt&#x27;s wife, wrote that Bennett &quot;is certainly the only man in England who ought to raise that institution from its present decay&quot;.

Bennett was to find that heading a leading music college was incompatible with a career as a composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, with the support of the faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.

In Stanford&#x27;s words, &quot;As Chairman he succeeded, after the Government had withdrawn its annual grant, in winning it back, restored the financial credit of the house, and during seven years bore the harassing anxiety of complex negotiations with various public bodies of great influence who were discussing schemes for the advance of national musical education.&quot; The schemes referred to were two proposals which would have undoubtedly undermined the viability and influence of the RAM, one to merge it in a proposed National School of Music, backed by the Royal Society of Arts under Henry Cole, the other to relocate it (without security of tenure) in the premises of the Royal Albert Hall.

The RAM in 1866 was in poor shape in terms of influence and reputation as well as financially. The critic Henry Chorley published data in that year showing that only 17 per cent of orchestral players in Britain had studied there. No alumni of the RAM were members of the orchestra at Covent Garden opera house. Chorley added, &quot;I cannot remember one great instrumental player the Academy has turned out during the last 25 years.&quot; Bennett himself was not entirely in accord with the emphasis Chorley placed on instrumental training for the RAM; he was concerned (and with reason) that such a policy could mean supply outstripping demand for graduates. Bennett himself taught composition at the RAM; this was undoubtedly where his greatest interests lay at this period, and it appears that the examples he gave to his pupils concentrated on his own &#x27;conservative&#x27; favourites of Mendelssohn, Beethoven and Mozart. Nonetheless, the reputation and popularity of the RAM increased markedly under his stewardship. The number of pupils, which had dropped catastrophically at the time when the directors had proposed closing the institution, rose steadily. At the end of 1868 there had been 66 students. By 1870 the number was 121, and by 1872 it was 176.

Bennett received honorary degrees from the universities of Cambridge (1867) and Oxford (1870). The Philharmonic Society awarded him its Beethoven gold medal in 1867. In 1871, he was knighted by Queen Victoria (two years after his old antagonist Costa had been accorded the same honour), and, in 1872, he received a public testimonial before a large audience at St James&#x27;s Hall, London. The money subscribed at this event founded a scholarship and prize at the RAM, which is still awarded. An English Heritage blue plaque has been placed at the house in 38 Queensborough Terrace, London, where Bennett lived during many of his later years.

Bennett died, aged 58, on 1 February 1875 at his house in St John&#x27;s Wood, London. According to his son the cause was &quot;disease of the brain&quot;; unable to rise one morning, he had fallen into a decline and died within a week. He was buried on 6 February, close to the tomb of Henry Purcell, in Westminster Abbey. The a cappella quartet, &quot;God is a Spirit&quot;, from his cantata &quot;The Woman of Samaria&quot;, was sung to accompany the obsequies. 

The first concert of the Philharmonic Society&#x27;s season, on 18 March, began with a tribute to its sometime conductor: pieces from his unfinished music for Sophocles&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Ajax&quot;, and the complete &quot;The Woman of Samaria&quot;, for which the choir was provided by the RAM. These were followed by Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto, for which the soloist was Joseph Joachim, to whom Mendelssohn had introduced Bennett at Joachim&#x27;s London debut in 1844. The final concert of the season (5 July) included an &quot;Idyll&quot; in memory of Bennett composed by his old associate George Alexander Macfarren.

==Family==
Bennett&#x27;s son, James Robert Sterndale Bennett (1847–1928), wrote a biography of his father. Many of the composer&#x27;s descendants became musicians or performers, including: 

* Robert Sterndale Bennett (1880–1963), a grandson, director of music at Uppingham School, Rutland 
* Thomas Case Sterndale Bennett (1882–1944), a grandson, a composer and singer, whose daughter Joan Sterndale-Bennett (1914–1996) was a well-known West End actress 
* Ernest Sterndale Bennett (1884–1982), a grandson, a Canadian theatre director 
* Charlie Simpson (born 1985), a great-great-grandson, a musician (Busted, Fightstar)

==Music==

===Style===
Stanford wrote of Bennett: He maintained his British characteristics throughout his life ... The English take a kind of pride in concealing their feelings and emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it is the type of the spirit of English folkmusic ... England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley.

W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: 
Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model. Geoffrey Bush agrees that &quot;[h]is best work, like his piano playing, was full of passion none the less powerful for being Mozartian (that is to say, perfectly controlled)&quot;, and characterizes him as &quot;essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin&quot;.
It would appear that Bennett displayed and aroused greater emotion through his piano technique than from his compositions. Stanford writes that &quot;his playing ... was undoubtedly remarkable and had a fire and energy in it which does not appear on the gentle surface of his music&quot;, and notes that Bennett&#x27;s performances were eulogized by, amongst others, John Field, Clara Schumann, and Ferdinand Hiller.

Bennett&#x27;s attitudes to the music of his continental contemporaries, aside from that of Mendelssohn, were cautious. Arthur Sullivan claimed that Bennett was &quot;bitterly prejudiced against the new school, as he called it. He would not have a note of Schumann; and as for Wagner, he was outside the pale of criticism.&quot; In Bennett&#x27;s 1858 lecture on &quot;The visits of illustrious foreign musicians to England&quot;, the latest mention is of Mendelssohn, bypassing Chopin, Wagner, Verdi and Hector Berlioz, (who all only came to England after Mendelssohn&#x27;s last visit); Liszt (who visited London in 1827) is omitted. In a subsequent lecture he opined that Verdi was &quot;immeasurably inferior&quot; to Gioachino Rossini, and could only say in favour of Berlioz that he &quot;must be allowed the character of a successful and devoted artist ... it cannot be doubted that his treatment of a great orchestra is masterly in the extreme.&quot; Of Wagner, &quot;the hero of the so-called &#x27;music of the future&#x27;&quot;, Bennett noted &quot;I have no intention of treating him disrespectfully; that I entirely misunderstand him and his musical opinions may be my fault and not his. At any rate he possesses an influence at this moment over musical life, which it would be impossible to overlook.&quot;

===Early compositions===
Bennett&#x27;s early period of composition was fruitful and includes those of his works which are most esteemed today. By the time of his first visit to Germany (1836) he had already written, amongst other works, five symphonies and three piano concerti. John Caldwell assesses his early songs as &quot;exquisitely judged essentially Mendelssohnian affairs ... the integration and coherence of their accompaniments is a strong feature.&quot;

Firman writes that Bennett&#x27;s finest works are those for the piano: &quot;Rejecting the superficial virtuosity of many of his contemporaries, he developed a style ... peculiarly his own, essentially classical in nature, but with reference to a multiplicity of influences from his own performance repertory.&quot; The early piano works were all praised by Robert Schumann, and Temperley points out how Schumann himself was influenced by them, with (as examples) clear traces of Bennett&#x27;s Op. 16 &quot;Fantasie&quot; (1837) (in effect a sonata) on Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Novelette&quot;, Op. 21 no. 7 (1838), and parallels between Bennett&#x27;s Op. 12 Impromptus (1836) and Schumann&#x27;s Op. 18 &quot;Arabesque&quot; (1838).

Temperley feels that the early symphonies are the weakest works of this period, but he suggests that &quot;few piano concertos between Beethoven and Brahms are as successful as Bennett&#x27;s in embodying the Classical spirit, not in a stiff frame to deck with festoons of virtuosity, but in a living form capable of organic growth, and even of structural surprise.&quot;

===Later works===
Bennett&#x27;s style did not develop after his early years. In 1908 the musicologist W. H. Hadow assessed his later work as follows: &quot;[W]hen &quot;The May Queen&quot; appeared [1858] the idiom of music had changed and he had not changed with it. ... He was too conservative to move with the times. ... [His last works] might all have been written in the forties; they are survivals of an earlier method, not developments but restatements of a tradition.&quot; Firman comments that later popular, and more superficial, pieces such as &quot;Genevieve&quot; (1839) came to overshadow the more innovative works of his earlier period such as the Sonata Op. 13, and the &quot;Fantasia&quot; Op. 16.

Young suggests that the cantatas &quot;The May Queen&quot; and &quot;The Woman of Samaria&quot; enjoyed in their hey-day &quot;a popularity that was in inverse relation to their intrinsic merit&quot;. Caldwell notes that &quot;The Woman of Samaria&quot; shows that &quot;Bennett was a good craftsman whose only fault was a dread of the operatic ... One would probably tolerate the narrative recitative more readily if the inserted movements showed any spark of life.&quot; As regards &quot;The May Queen&quot;, Caldwell praises the overture (a Mendelssohn-style work originally written as a concert piece in 1844) &quot;but the rest of the work is tame stuff&quot;. He comments that &quot;both works received immense longstanding popularity and may be considered as the narrative prototype for the later Victorian secular and sacred forms ... conforming to the current standards of taste and respectability&quot;, anticipating such works as Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Kenilworth&quot; (1864).

Lewis Foreman cites Bennett&#x27;s late Symphony in G minor Op. 43 (1864-67) as &quot;the first British symphony to find a regular place in the repertoire until well into the twentieth century&quot;.

===Editions and writings===
Bennett edited some of the keyboard works of Beethoven and Handel and co-edited the &quot;Chorale Book for England&quot; with Otto Goldschmidt (1863), based on German hymns collected by Catherine Winkworth. He supervised the first British printed edition of the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;. A full vocal score (with piano accompaniment) was adapted from the German edition prepared by Adolf Bernhard Marx (Berlin 1830), which followed Mendelssohn&#x27;s revival of the work; this was revised with reference to the score published by the Leipzig Bach Society in 1862. Bennett&#x27;s additional tempo and dynamic markings were shown in parentheses for distinction. He provided harmonies for the figured bass both in the solo music sections (based on the Leipzig full score) and elsewhere. Bennett also produced editions of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; and Handel&#x27;s masque &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;.

Bennett lectured both at Cambridge and the London Institute; texts of his lectures were edited and published in 2006. At a Sheffield lecture in 1859 he also played works of the composers he discussed, and &quot;so may be regarded as the founder of the lecture-recital&quot;.

==Reception==
As a composer Bennett was acknowledged in his time in both Britain and (particularly in the first half of the century) in Germany, although many British music lovers and several leading critics remained reluctant to acknowledge the possibility that an English composer could be of the same stature as a German one. The Leipzig public, which had initially held that view, had been rapidly converted. Mendelssohn wrote to Bennett &quot;... [M]y Countrymen became aware that music is the same in England as in Germany and everywhere, and so by your successes you have destroyed that prejudice which nobody could ever have destroyed but a true Genius.&quot;

Bennett&#x27;s son, in his biography of his father, juxtaposes as illustrations English and German reviews of the overture &quot;The Wood Nymphs&quot;. The London critic William Ayrton wrote:

Schumann, by contrast, wrote:
&quot;The overture is charming; indeed, save Spohr and Mendelssohn, what other living composer is so completely master of his pencil, or bestows with it such tenderness and grace of colour, as Bennett? ... Essay measure after measure; what a firm, yet delicate web it is from beginning to end!&quot;

Outside these countries, Bennett remained almost unknown as a musician, although his reputation as a conductor led Berlioz to invite him to join his &quot;Société Philharmonique&quot;, and the Dutch composer Johannes Verhulst solicited his support for the Netherlands &quot;Society for Encouragement of Music&quot;. Davison&#x27;s attempts to interest the French composer Charles Gounod in Bennett&#x27;s music led to polite but sardonic responses.

In the United States, meanwhile, the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; called Bennett &quot;probably the greatest composer produced by England&quot; with the exception of Henry Purcell two centuries earlier, echoing Schumann&#x27;s sentiments about &quot;The Wood Nymphs&quot; and hailing the G minor symphony (Op. 43), but tempered his praise:

==Legacy==
Sir John Betjeman, in a 1975 lecture, rated Bennett as &quot;Queen Victoria&#x27;s Senior Musical Knight&quot;. Temperley assesses Bennett as the most distinguished British composer of the early Victorian era, &quot;the only plausible rivals being Samuel Sebastian Wesley (1810–76) and Michael William Balfe (1808–70)&quot;.

The novelist Elizabeth Sara Sheppard portrayed Bennett as &#x27;Starwood Burney&#x27; in her popular eulogy of Mendelssohn, the 1853 novel &quot;Charles Auchester&quot;. Although Bennett&#x27;s reputation in Germany did not notably survive the 1840s, his English pupils had significant influence on British music of the later 19th and earlier 20th century Britain. Among his pupils at the RAM and elsewhere were Arthur Sullivan, Joseph Parry, Alice Mary Smith, W. S. Rockstro, Stephen Kemp, Hubert Parry, Tobias Matthay, Francis Edward Bache, Eaton Faning and William Cusins. Bennett&#x27;s contributions to elevating musical training standards at Cambridge and the RAM were part of a trend in England in the latter part of the 19th century whose &quot;cumulative effect ... prior to World War I was incalculable&quot;, according to Caldwell.

Through his concert initiatives at the Hanover Rooms Bennett introduced a variety of chamber music to London audiences. His championship also significantly changed British opinion of the music of JS Bach. His &quot;promotion of Bach was a story of perseverance against a contemporary perception that Bach&#x27;s music was ... too difficult to listen to.&quot; Newspaper reviews of the chamber concerts in which he included the music of Bach would initially describe the music in terms such as &quot;grandeur there is, but no beauty&quot; (1847) or &quot;somewhat antiquated ... [but] extremely interesting&quot; (1854). A significant turning point was the attendance of Prince Albert at Bennett&#x27;s 1858 performance of the &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot;.

Bennett left a substantial music library, a large proportion of which is owned by his great-great-grandson Barry Sterndale Bennett (born 1939) and is on deposit at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Of his total of some 130 compositions, about a third have been recorded for CD; among these are symphonies, overtures, piano concerti, chamber music, songs and piano solo music. During his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts and events dedicated to Bennett&#x27;s works were performed, including concerts and seminars at the RAM. From 11 to 15 April 2016 he was featured as &#x27;Composer of the Week&#x27; on BBC Radio 3.

<doc id="313384" wikidata="Q1854385" url="?curid=313384" title="Long division">
<text>In arithmetic, long division is a standard division algorithm suitable for dividing multi-digit Hindu-Arabic numerals (positional notation) that is simple enough to perform by hand. It breaks down a division problem into a series of easier steps.

As in all division problems, one number, called the dividend, is divided by another, called the divisor, producing a result called the quotient. It enables computations involving arbitrarily large numbers to be performed by following a series of simple steps. The abbreviated form of long division is called short division, which is almost always used instead of long division when the divisor has only one digit.

==History==

Related algorithms have existed since the 12th century.
Al-Samawal al-Maghribi (1125–1174) performed calculations with decimal numbers that essentially require long division, leading to infinite decimal results, but without formalizing the algorithm.
Caldrini (1491) is the earliest printed example of long division, known as the &quot;Danda&quot; method in medieval Italy, and it became more practical with the introduction of decimal notation for fractions by Pitiscus (1608).
The specific algorithm in modern use was introduced by Henry Briggs 1600.

== Education ==

Inexpensive calculators and computers have become the most common way to solve division problems, eliminating a traditional mathematical exercise and decreasing the educational opportunity to show how to do so by paper and pencil techniques. (Internally, those devices use one of a variety of division algorithms, the faster of which rely on approximations and multiplications to achieve the tasks.) In North America, long division has been especially targeted for de-emphasis or even elimination from the school curriculum by reform mathematics, though it has been traditionally introduced in the 4th, 5th or even 6th grades.

== Method ==
In English-speaking countries, long division does not use the division slash or division sign symbols but instead constructs a tableau. The divisor is separated from the dividend by a right parenthesis or vertical bar ; the dividend is separated from the quotient by a vinculum (i.e., an overbar). The combination of these two symbols is sometimes known as a long division symbol or division bracket. It developed in the 18th century from an earlier single-line notation separating the dividend from the quotient by a left parenthesis.

The process is begun by dividing the left-most digit of the dividend by the divisor. The quotient (rounded down to an integer) becomes the first digit of the result, and the remainder is calculated (this step is notated as a subtraction). This remainder carries forward when the process is repeated on the following digit of the dividend (notated as &#x27;bringing down&#x27; the next digit to the remainder). When all digits have been processed and no remainder is left, the process is complete.

An example is shown below, representing the division of 500 by 4 (with a result of 125).
 125 (Explanations)
 4)500
 4 ( 4 × 1 = 4)
 10 ( 5 - 4 = 1)
 8 ( 4 × 2 = 8)
 20 (10 - 8 = 2)
 20 ( 4 × 5 = 20)
 0 (20 - 20 = 0)
A more detailed breakdown of the steps goes as follows:

# Find the shortest sequence of digits starting from the left end of the dividend, 500, that the divisor 4 goes into at least once. In this case, this is simply the first digit, 5. The largest number that the divisor 4 can be multiplied by without exceeding 5 is 1, so the digit 1 is put above the 5 to start constructing the quotient.
# Next, the 1 is multiplied by the divisor 4, to obtain the largest whole number that is a multiple of the divisor 4 without exceeding the 5 (4 in this case). This 4 is then placed under and subtracted from the 5 to get the remainder, 1, which is placed under the 4 under the 5. 
# Afterwards, the first as-yet unused digit in the dividend, in this case the first digit 0 after the 5, is copied directly underneath itself and next to the remainder 1, to form the number 10. 
# At this point the process is repeated enough times to reach a stopping point: The largest number by which the divisor 4 can be multiplied without exceeding 10 is 2, so 2 is written above as the second leftmost quotient digit. This 2 is then multiplied by the divisor 4 to get 8, which is the largest multiple of 4 that does not exceed 10; so 8 is written below 10, and the subtraction 10 minus 8 is performed to get the remainder 2, which is placed below the 8. 
# The next digit of the dividend (the last 0 in 500) is copied directly below itself and next to the remainder 2 to form 20. Then the largest number by which the divisor 4 can be multiplied without exceeding 20, which is 5, is placed above as the third leftmost quotient digit. This 5 is multiplied by the divisor 4 to get 20, which is written below and subtracted from the existing 20 to yield the remainder 0, which is then written below the second 20. 
# At this point, since there are no more digits to bring down from the dividend and the last subtraction result was 0, we can be assured that the process finished.

If the last remainder when we ran out of dividend digits had been something other than 0, there would have been two possible courses of action:

# We could just stop there and say that the dividend divided by the divisor is the quotient written at the top with the remainder written at the bottom, and write the answer as the quotient followed by a fraction that is the remainder divided by the divisor.
# We could extend the dividend by writing it as, say, 500.000... and continue the process (using a decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the dividend), in order to get a decimal answer, as in the following example.

 31.75 
 4)127.00
 12 (12 ÷ 4 = 3)
 07 (0 remainder, bring down next figure)
 4 (7 ÷ 4 = 1 r 3) 
 3.0 (bring down 0 and the decimal point)
 2.8 (7 × 4 = 28, 30 ÷ 4 = 7 r 2)
 20 (an additional zero is brought down)
 20 (5 × 4 = 20)
 0

In this example, the decimal part of the result is calculated by continuing the process beyond the units digit, &quot;bringing down&quot; zeros as being the decimal part of the dividend.

This example also illustrates that, at the beginning of the process, a step that produces a zero can be omitted. Since the first digit 1 is less than the divisor 4, the first step is instead performed on the first two digits 12. Similarly, if the divisor were 13, one would perform the first step on 127 rather than 12 or 1.

===Basic procedure for long division of ===

# Find the location of all decimal points in the dividend and divisor .
# If necessary, simplify the long division problem by moving the decimals of the divisor and dividend by the same number of decimal places, to the right (or to the left), so that the decimal of the divisor is to the right of the last digit.
# When doing long division, keep the numbers lined up straight from top to bottom under the tableau.
# After each step, be sure the remainder for that step is less than the divisor. If it is not, there are three possible problems: the multiplication is wrong, the subtraction is wrong, or a greater quotient is needed.
# In the end, the remainder, , is added to the growing quotient as a fraction, .

===Invariant property and correctness===
The basic presentation of the steps of the process (above)
focus on the &quot;what&quot; steps are to be performed,
rather than the &quot;properties of those steps&quot; that ensure the result will be correct
(specifically, that &quot;q × m + r = n&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; is the final quotient and &quot;r&quot; the final remainder).
A slight variation of presentation requires more writing,
and requires that we change, rather than just update, digits of the quotient,
but can shed more light on &quot;why&quot; these steps actually produce the right answer
by allowing evaluation of &quot;q × m + r&quot; at intermediate points in the process.
This illustrates the key property used in the derivation of the algorithm 
(below).

Specifically, we amend the above basic procedure so that
we fill the space after the digits of the &quot;quotient&quot; under construction with 0&#x27;s, to at least the 1&#x27;s place,
and include those 0&#x27;s in the numbers we write below the division bracket.

This lets us maintain an invariant relation at every step:
&quot;q × m + r = n&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; is the partially-constructed quotient (above the division bracket)
and &quot;r&quot; the partially-constructed remainder (bottom number below the division bracket).
Note that, initially &quot;q=0&quot; and &quot;r=n&quot;, so this property holds initially;
the process reduces r and increases q with each step,
eventually stopping when &quot;r&lt;m&quot; if we seek the answer in quotient + integer remainder form.

Revisiting the &quot;500 ÷ 4&quot; example above, we find

 125 (&quot;q&quot;, changes from 000 to 100 to 120 to 125 as per notes below)
 4)500
 400 ( 4 × 100 = 400)
 100 (500 - 400 = 100; now &quot;q=100&quot;, &quot;r=100&quot;; note &quot;q×4+r = 500&quot;.)
 80 ( 4 × 20 = 80)
 20 (100 - 80 = 20; now &quot;q=120&quot;, &quot;r= 20&quot;; note &quot;q×4+r = 500&quot;.)
 20 ( 4 × 5 = 20)
 0 ( 20 - 20 = 0; now &quot;q=125&quot;, &quot;r= 0&quot;; note &quot;q×4+r = 500&quot;.)

===Example with multi-digit divisor===
A divisor of any number of digits can be used. In this example, 1260257 is to be divided by 37. First the problem is set up as follows:
 37)1260257

Digits of the number 1260257 are taken until a number greater than or equal to 37 occurs. So 1 and 12 are less than 37, but 126 is greater. Next, the greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 126 is computed. So 3 × 37 = 111 &lt; 126, but 4 × 37 &gt; 126. The multiple 111 is written underneath the 126 and the 3 is written on the top where the solution will appear:

 3 
 37)1260257
 111

Note carefully which place-value column these digits are written into. The 3 in the quotient goes in the same column (ten-thousands place) as the 6 in the dividend 1260257, which is the same column as the last digit of 111.

The 111 is then subtracted from the line above, ignoring all digits to the right:

 3 
 37)1260257
 111
 15

Now the digit from the next smaller place value of the dividend is copied down and appended to the result 15:

 3 
 37)1260257
 111
 150

The process repeats: the greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 150 is subtracted. This is 148 = 4 × 37, so a 4 is added to the top as the next quotient digit. Then the result of the subtraction is extended by another digit taken from the dividend:

 34 
 37)1260257
 111
 150
 148
 22

The greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 22 is 0 × 37 = 0. Subtracting 0 from 22 gives 22, we often don&#x27;t write the subtraction step. Instead, we simply take another digit from the dividend:

 340 
 37)1260257
 111
 150
 148
 225

The process is repeated until 37 divides the last line exactly:

 34061
 37)1260257
 111
 150
 148
 225
 222
 37

===Mixed mode long division===
For non-decimal currencies (such as the British £sd system before 1971) and measures (such as avoirdupois) mixed mode division must be used. Consider dividing 50 miles 600 yards into 37 pieces:

 mi - yd - ft - in
 1 - 634 1 9 r. 15&quot;
 37) 50 - 600 - 0 - 0
 37 22880 66 348
 13 23480 66 348
 1760 222 37 333
 22880 128 29 15
 ===== 111 348 ==
 170 ===
 148
 22
 66

Each of the four columns is worked in turn. Starting with the miles: 50/37 = 1 remainder 13. No further division is
possible, so perform a long multiplication by 1,760 to convert miles to yards, the result is 22,880 yards. Carry this to the top of the yards column and add it to the 600 yards in the dividend giving 23,480. Long division of 23,480 / 37 now proceeds as normal yielding 634 with remainder 22. The remainder is multiplied by 3 to get feet and carried up to the feet column. Long division of the feet gives 1 remainder 29 which is then multiplied by twelve to get 348 inches. Long division continues with the final remainder of 15 inches being shown on the result line.

===Interpretation of decimal results===

When the quotient is not an integer and the division process is extended beyond the decimal point, one of two things can happen:

# The process can terminate, which means that a remainder of 0 is reached; or
# A remainder could be reached that is identical to a previous remainder that occurred after the decimal points were written. In the latter case, continuing the process would be pointless, because from that point onward the same sequence of digits would appear in the quotient over and over. So a bar is drawn over the repeating sequence to indicate that it repeats forever (i.e., every rational number is either a terminating or repeating decimal).

==Notation in non-English-speaking countries==

China, Japan, Korea use the same notation as English-speaking nations including India. Elsewhere, the same general principles are used, but the figures are often arranged differently.

===Latin America===
In Latin America (except Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico, Colombia, Paraguay, Venezuela, Uruguay and Brazil), the calculation is almost exactly the same, but is written down differently as shown below with the same two examples used above. Usually the quotient is written under a bar drawn under the divisor. A long vertical line is sometimes drawn to the right of the calculations.

 500 ÷ 4 = 125 (Explanations) 
 4 ( 4 × 1 = 4)
 10 ( 5 - 4 = 1)
 8 ( 4 × 2 = 8)
 20 (10 - 8 = 2)
 20 ( 4 × 5 = 20)
 0 (20 - 20 = 0)

and

 127 ÷ 4 = 31.75
 124 
 30 (bring down 0; decimal to quotient)
 28 (7 × 4 = 28)
 20 (an additional zero is added)
 20 (5 × 4 = 20)
 0
In Mexico, the English-speaking world notation is used, except that only the result of the subtraction is annotated and the calculation is done mentally, as shown below:

 125 (Explanations)
 4)500
 10 ( 5 - 4 = 1)
 20 (10 - 8 = 2)
 0 (20 - 20 = 0)

In Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Venezuela, French-speaking Canada, Colombia, and Peru, the European notation (see below) is used, except that the quotient is not separated by a vertical line, as shown below:

 127|4 
 −124 31,75
 30
 −28
 20
 −20
 0

Same procedure applies in Mexico, Uruguay and Argentina, only the result of the subtraction is annotated and the calculation is done mentally.

===Eurasia===
In Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Lithuania, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, the divisor is to the right of the dividend, and separated by a vertical bar. The division also occurs in the column, but the quotient (result) is written below the divider, and separated by the horizontal line. The same method is used in Iran, Vietnam, and Mongolia.

 127|4 
 −124|31,75
 30
 −28
 20
 −20
 0

In Cyprus, as well as in France, a long vertical bar separates the dividend and subsequent subtractions from the quotient and divisor, as in the example below of 6359 divided by 17, which is 374 with a remainder of 1.

 6359|17 
 −51 |374
 125 |
 −119 |
 69|
 −68|
 1|

Decimal numbers are not divided directly, the dividend and divisor are multiplied by a power of ten so that the division involves two whole numbers. Therefore, if one were dividing 12,7 by 0,4 (commas being used instead of decimal points), the dividend and divisor would first be changed to 127 and 4, and then the division would proceed as above.

In Austria, Germany and Switzerland, the notational form of a normal equation is used. &lt;dividend&gt; : &lt;divisor&gt; = &lt;quotient&gt;, with the colon &quot;:&quot; denoting a binary infix symbol for the division operator (analogous to &quot;/&quot; or &quot;÷&quot;). In these regions the decimal separator is written as a comma. (cf. first section of Latin American countries above, where it&#x27;s done virtually the same way):

 127 : 4 = 31,75
 −12
 07
 −4
 30
 −28
 20
 −20
 0

The same notation is adopted in Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Vietnam and in Serbia.

In the Netherlands, the following notation is used:

 12 / 135 \ 11,25
 12
 15
 12
 30
 24
 60
 60
 0

In Finland, the Italian method detailed above was replaced by the Anglo-American one in the 1970s. In the early 2000s, however, some textbooks have adopted the German method as it retains the order between the divisor and the dividend.

==Algorithm for arbitrary base ==

Every natural number formula_1 can be uniquely represented in an arbitrary number base formula_2 as a sequence of digits formula_3 where formula_4, where formula_5 is the number of digits in formula_1. The value of formula_1 in terms of its digits and the base is
:formula_8
Let formula_1 be the dividend and formula_10 be the divisor, where formula_11 is the number of digits in formula_10. If formula_13, then quotient formula_14 and remainder formula_15. Otherwise, we iterate from formula_16, before stopping.

For each iteration formula_17, let formula_18 be the quotient extracted so far, formula_19 be the intermediate dividend, formula_20 be the intermediate remainder, formula_21 be the next digit of the original dividend, and formula_22 be the next digit of the quotient. By definition of digits in base formula_23, formula_24. All values are natural numbers. We initiate 
:formula_25
:formula_26
the first formula_27 digits of formula_1.

With every iteration, the three equations are true:
:formula_29
:formula_30
:formula_31
There only exists one such formula_22 such that formula_33.
The final quotient is formula_34 and the final remainder is formula_35

===Examples===
In base 10, using the example above with formula_36 and formula_37, the initial values formula_38 and formula_39.

Thus, formula_40 and formula_41.

In base 16, with formula_42 and formula_43, the initial values are formula_38 and formula_45.

Thus, formula_46 and formula_47.

If one doesn&#x27;t have the addition, subtraction, or multiplication tables for base memorised, then this algorithm still works if the numbers are converted to decimal and at the end are converted back to base . For example, with the above example, 
:formula_48
and 
:formula_49
with formula_50. The initial values are formula_38 and formula_52.
Thus, formula_53 and formula_54.

This algorithm can be done using the same kind of pencil-and-paper notations as shown in above sections.

=== Rational quotients ===
If the quotient is not constrained to be an integer, then the algorithm does not terminate for formula_55. Instead, if formula_55 then formula_57 by definition. If the remainder formula_20 is equal to zero at any iteration, then the quotient is a formula_23-adic fraction, and is represented as a finite decimal expansion in base formula_23 positional notation. Otherwise, it is still a rational number but not a formula_23-adic rational, and is instead represented as an infinite repeating decimal expansion in base formula_23 positional notation.

=== Binary division ===
=== Performance ===
On each iteration, the most time-consuming task is to select formula_22. We know that there are formula_23 possible values, so we can find formula_22 using formula_66 comparisons. Each comparison will require evaluating formula_67. Let formula_5 be the number of digits in the dividend formula_1 and formula_11 be the number of digits in the divisor formula_10. The number of digits in formula_72. The multiplication of formula_73 is therefore formula_74, and likewise the subtraction of formula_67. Thus it takes formula_76 to select formula_22. The remainder of the algorithm are addition and the digit-shifting of formula_18 and formula_20 to the left one digit, and so takes time formula_80 and formula_74 in base formula_23, so each iteration takes formula_83, or just formula_84. For all formula_85 digits, the algorithm takes time formula_86, or formula_87 in base formula_23.

==Generalizations==
=== Rational numbers ===
Long division of integers can easily be extended to include non-integer dividends, as long as they are rational. This is because every rational number has a recurring decimal expansion. The procedure can also be extended to include divisors which have a finite or terminating decimal expansion (i.e. decimal fractions). In this case the procedure involves multiplying the divisor and dividend by the appropriate power of ten so that the new divisor is an integer – taking advantage of the fact that &quot;a&quot; ÷ &quot;b&quot; = (&quot;ca&quot;) ÷ (&quot;cb&quot;) – and then proceeding as above.

===Polynomials===
A generalised version of this method called polynomial long division is also used for dividing polynomials (sometimes using a shorthand version called synthetic division).

<text>Arkansas Post is an unincorporated community located along the north side of the Arkansas River in Arkansas County, Arkansas. It is home to the Arkansas Post National Memorial.

==History==
In 1805 the U.S. government established a store at the location, but was closed in 1810, due to competition from private merchants. Nathaniel Pryor, who participated in the Lewis and Clark expedition, and Samuel B. Richards of Natchez established a store at the location after the War of 1812. Present-day Arkansas Post was founded on December 27, 1831, with the establishment of the first U.S. post office in the Arkansas Territory.

<text>The Arkansas Post (; ), officially the Arkansas Post National Memorial, was the first European settlement in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain and present-day U.S. state of Arkansas. In 1686, Henri de Tonti established it on behalf of Louis XIV of France for the purpose of trading with the Quapaw Nation. The French, Spanish, and Americans, who acquired the territory in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase, considered the site of strategic value. It was the capital of Arkansas from 1819 until 1821 when the territorial government relocated to Little Rock.

During the fur trade years, Arkansas Post was protected by a series of fortifications. The forts and associated settlements were located at three known sites and possibly a fourth. Some of the historic structures have been lost as the waterfront has been subject to erosion and flooding. The land encompassing the second (and fourth) Arkansas Post site (Red Bluff) was designated as a state park in 1929. In 1960, about of land at the site were protected as the Arkansas Post National Memorial, a National Memorial and National Historic Landmark.

Since the 1950s, three archeological excavations have been conducted at Arkansas Post. Experts say the most extensive cultural resources at the site are archaeological, both for the 18th and 19th-century European-American settlements, and the earlier Quapaw villages. Due to changes of the Arkansas River and its navigation measures, the local water level has risen closer to the height of the bluffs, which used to be well above the river. The site is now considered low lying. Erosion and construction of dams, canals, and locks on the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers have resulted in the remains of three of the historic forts now being underwater in the river channel.

==History==
===French jurisdiction (1686–1763)===

====First location====

The Arkansas Post was founded in the summer of 1686 by Henri de Tonti, Jacques Cardinal, Jean Couture, Peter Bisaillon, and three other Frenchmen as a trading post near the site of a Quapaw village named &quot;Osotouy&quot;. It was about 35 miles upriver from the strategically significant confluence of the Arkansas River with the Mississippi River. The post was established on land given to De Tonti for his service in René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle&#x27;s 1682 expedition. The French came to an arrangement with the local Quapaw to trade French goods for beaver furs. This arrangement did not yield much profit, as the Quapaw had little interest in hunting beaver. But the trade and friendly relations with the Quapaw and other local native peoples, such as the Caddo and Osage, were integral to the post&#x27;s survival for most of its operations.

The French settlers initially called the post &quot;Aux Arcs&quot; (&quot;at the home of the Arkansas.&quot; &quot;Arkansea&quot; was the Algonquian name used by the Illinois and related tribes to refer to the Quapaw, and was adopted by the French.) The traders first built a simple wooden house and fence at the site. This was the first permanent French holding west of the Mississippi and the first European settlement in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Here the French conducted the first documented Christian services in Arkansas.

The importance of the post was fully realized in 1699, when King Louis XIV of France began to invest more resources into French Louisiana. John Law&#x27;s Mississippi Company made a venture from 1717 to 1724 recruiting German settlers to develop the surrounding area as a major agricultural hub. The plan was to grow crops on the lower Arkansas for trade with Arkansas Post, New Orleans (which did not have the climate to support grain cultivation), and French Illinois. The French brought about 100 slaves and indentured servants to the area as workers, and offered land grants to German settlers. But this project failed when the company withdrew from Arkansas Post, due to financial decline related to the Mississippi Bubble. Most of the slaves and indentured servants were relocated or sold elsewhere along the Lower Mississippi River, but a few remained in or near the post, becoming hunters, farmers, and traders. By 1720, the post had lost much of its significance to the French because of the lack of profit, and the population was low. In 1723, the post was garrisoned by thirteen French soldiers, and Lieutenant Avignon Guérin de La Boulaye was the commander. Father Paul du Poisson was the priest at the post from July 1727 until his death in 1729. The post was significantly expanded in 1731, when its new commander, First Ensign Pierre Louis Petit de Coulange, built a barracks, a powder magazine, a prison, and a house for him and future commanders.

On May 10, 1749, during the Chickasaw Wars, the post engaged in its first military action. Chief Payamataha of the Chickasaw attacked the rural areas of the post with 150 of his warriors, killing and capturing several settlers.

The site of this first post is believed to be near what is now called the Menard–Hodges site, located about (but about by road) from the Arkansas Post Memorial. This property, also a National Historic Landmark, is owned by the National Park Service, and is undeveloped.

====Second location (Red Bluff)====
As a result of the Chickasaw raid and continued threats of attack, commander Ensign Louis Xavier Martin de Lino moved the post upriver. This was further from the Chickasaw territory east of the Mississippi, and closer to the Quapaw villages, the post&#x27;s main trading partners and potential allies. This new location, about 45 miles from the mouth of the Arkansas, was called &quot;Écores Rouges&quot; (Red Bluff), at &quot;the heights of the Grand Prairie&quot;. It was situated on a bend in the river, on higher ground than the previous site.

In 1752, Captain Paul Augustin Le Pelletier de La Houssaye, the next commander, rebuilt the post&#x27;s major structures, such as the barrack, prison, and powder magazine. In addition, he expanded the commander&#x27;s house to include a chapel and quarters for the priest. He added a storehouse, hospital, bake house, and latrine. To protect the post&#x27;s new buildings, he erected a stockade eleven feet in height.

====Third location====
In 1756, after the start of the Seven Years&#x27; War between France and England, Captain Francois de Reggio moved the post to a location 10 miles from the confluence with the Mississippi in order for the post to better respond to British and Chickasaw attacks. Whereas the first two locations had been on the Arkansas&#x27;s north bank, this one was on the south. The layout of this post was generally similar to earlier ones, containing the usual important structures protected by a stockade.

=== Spanish jurisdiction (1763–1802) ===

After the British defeated the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War and gained most of their North American territories east of the Mississippi, France ceded the area west of the Mississippi to Spain. This was in exchange for the British to gain land in Spanish Florida and give up any claims to Cuba. The post was officially ceded to Spain in 1763, but Spain did not take up its administration until 1771.

Initially, the Spanish kept the post at the third site and built the first Fort Carlos there to defend it. The majority of the post&#x27;s population remained French. This reality complicated Spain&#x27;s effort for diplomacy. In 1772, Commander Fernando de Leyba was ordered to assert dominance over the local French and to reduce the amount of feasts and gifts they provided for the local Quapaw, as it was costing the colonial government too much. The Quapaw nearly came to blows with the Spanish, but eventually Commander Leyba conceded to previous practice and restored the goods, and conflict was avoided.

====Fourth location (Red Bluff)====
In 1777 and 1778, the post was partially inundated by floodwaters. The garrison captain, Balthazar de Villiers, wrote to the Spanish governor of Louisiana, Bernardo de Gálvez, requesting the post be moved upriver. De Villiers cited annual flooding and the long distance from the local Quapaw villages as concerns. In the fall of 1778, Colonel David Rogers and Capt. Robert Benham made a stop here while on their way to meet with Gálvez to convince him that Spain should support the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War.
Gálvez gave permission for de Villiers to move the post back to the site of the second French post, 36 miles upriver at Red Bluff, and in 1779, the post was relocated. The colonists hoped the settlement would be less flood-prone. Fort Carlos III was built here in July 1781, near the former Le Houssaye fort. It consisted of several small buildings surrounded by a stockade. During the last two decades of the 18th century, several Americans from the new United States settled at the post. They developed a separate American village on the bluffs north of the river, nearer to the Quapaw villages. Many of these settlers arrived as refugees from the American Revolutionary War.

The only battle of the Revolution fought in present-day Arkansas took place on April 17, 1783, when Captain James Colbert of the 16th Regiment of Foot led a force of British partisans and Chickasaw allies on a raid against Spanish forces controlling Arkansas Post. This was part of a small British campaign against the Spanish on the Mississippi River during the American Revolutionary War, when power was shifting in North America. The Spanish defended it with their soldiers, Quapaw allies, and settlers acting as Indians to scare off the partisans.

Fort Carlos III suffered from constant river erosion, so the Spanish relocated the military garrison to a site about half a mile from the waterfront and, in March 1791, built Fort San Estevan (renamed Fort Madison after the Louisiana Purchase). Fort San Estevan included a commandant&#x27;s house, large barracks, storehouse and kitchen, all surrounded by a stockade.

====Second French ownership (1802–1804)====

Although Spain ceded Louisiana and the Arkansas Post to France in 1800, no French officials were sent to administer the post. The Spanish garrison remained to oversee the post until the Louisiana Purchase was made by the United States.

=== United States jurisdiction (1804–present) ===

In 1804, Arkansas Post became a part of the United States as a result of the Louisiana Purchase from France. By the time the post was sold, it contained 30 houses in rows along two perpendicular streets. These were inhabited mostly by the post&#x27;s ethnic French population.

The American settlers predominately lived in the separate villages north of the post, although further American settlement began after purchase by the United States. Americans built new buildings in the main part of the post alongside French and Spanish ones. The post was guarded by Fort Madison, in use until 1810, when it was abandoned in turn due to erosion and flooding.

In 1805, the U.S. government built a federal trading house at the north end of the post, operated by Jacob Bright. The location became a major frontier post for travelers heading west, with explorers such as Stephen Harriman Long and Thomas Nuttall passing through, althogut the government closed the federal house in 1810.

Arkansas Post was selected to be the capital of Arkansas County in 1813. In 1819, it was selected as the first capital of the new Arkansas Territory. It became the center of commercial and political life in Arkansas. The territory&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot;, was founded in 1819 at the post by William E. Woodruff.

A tavern owned by William Montgomery was operated at the post, in Bright&#x27;s trading house, from 1819 to 1821. This structure also served as the meeting place for the first Arkansas Territorial General Assembly in February 1820. During its period as territorial capital, Arkansas Post grew substantially, and two towns were established near it.

Gradually, settlement developed further into the Arkansas River Valley, and Little Rock became the territory&#x27;s dominant settlement. When the territorial capital was moved there in 1821, the territory&#x27;s major businesses and institutions moved as well. Arkansas Post lost much of its importance as a result.

The settlement continued to be active as a river town through the 1840s after steamboat traffic increased on the rivers. A French entrepreneur, Colonel Frederick Notrebe, came to dominate commercial life at the post. His establishment consisted of a house, a store, a brick store, a warehouse, a cotton gin, and a press. In the 1840s, the post was expanded with several new buildings, including one to serve as the Arkansas Post Branch of the State Bank of Arkansas. By the 1850s, the post was in a period of decline, and the population shrank significantly.

A well and cistern were built at the post in the early 1800s and remain intact at the memorial site to this day.

====Confederate control (1861–1863)====

During the American Civil War, the post remained an important strategic site militarily. In 1862, the Confederate States Army constructed a massive defensive earthwork known as Fort Hindman, named after Confederate General Thomas C. Hindman. It was located on a bluff above the river on the north bank, with a view up and downriver. It was designed to prevent Union forces from going upriver to Little Rock and to disrupt Union movement on the Mississippi. On January 9–11 of 1863, Union forces conducted an amphibious assault on the fortress backed by ironclad gunboats as part of the Vicksburg campaign. Because the Union forces outnumbered the defenders (33,000 to 5,500), they won an easy victory and captured the post, with most of the Confederate garrison surrendering. During the battle, the artillery bombardments destroyed or severely damaged the fort and some buildings in the town. Arkansas Post lost any status it had retained since being replaced as the territorial capital, and became a mostly rural area.

The Union victory relieved much of the harassment by Confederate forces on the Mississippi and contributed to the eventual victory at Vicksburg, Mississippi.

During the period of Confederate control, the state bank building was used as a hospital. Parts of the Confederate road, trenches, and artillery positions built at the post during this era are still visible at the memorial site.

==Description and administrative history==
The Arkansas Post National Memorial is a protected area in Arkansas County, Arkansas, United States. The National Park Service manages of the land, and the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism manages a museum on the remaining grounds.

The Memorial commemorates the complex history of several cultures and time periods: the Quapaw, French settlers who were the first colonists to inhabit the small entrepôt, the short period of Spanish rule, an American Revolutionary War skirmish in 1783, the settlement&#x27;s role as the first territorial capital of Arkansas, and as the site of an American Civil War battle in 1863.

The former site of Arkansas Post was made into a state park in 1929. The park began with 20 acres donated by Fred Quandt, a descendant of German immigrants whose family still lives in Arkansas. In the following years, additional acreage was acquired and numerous improvements made with the support of Civilian Conservation Corps labor.

On July 6, 1960, the site was designated a National Memorial, and a National Historic Landmark on October 9, 1960. As with all National Historic Landmarks, Arkansas Post was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

==Archaeology==
In 1956–1957, Preston Holder conducted the first archeological excavations at the site. His team found remains of the eighteenth-century French colonial village within the area of the current memorial. The trenches discovered there were later identified as traditional French colonial residential building patterns of &quot;poteaux-en-terre&quot;. By this time, the remains of the 1752 La Houssaye fort, Fort Carlos III, 1790s Fort San Estevan, and Fort Hindman were all underwater in the former Arkansas River channel, an area then used as a navigation lake. No archeological evidence remains for those forts because of the erosion.

In 1964 the National Park Service undertook some partial reconstruction of colonial remains at the site, including Fort Carlos III built by the Spanish. Additional archeological excavations of the colonial settlement were done for the National Park Service in 1966 and 1970–1971. Nineteenth-century buildings identified include the state bank and residences. Most of the residences were built in a French or Spanish colonial style, although a house&#x27;s architecture varied based on the resident&#x27;s culture. Also discovered in various excavations were thousands of ceramic shards. John Walthall, the state archeologist for Arkansas, said in the 1990s that the archeological resources constitute the most valuable cultural resources within the area of the memorial, including nearly unexplored Quapaw settlements, as well as the 18th- and 19th-century European and American settlements. Archeological ventures have generally been more successful in the more northerly portion of the historic site because it was less prone to erosion and flooding. No physical traces remain of the post&#x27;s historical waterfront because of such erosion.

<text>A nom de guerre (, &#x27;war name&#x27;) is a pseudonym chosen by someone to use when he or she is involved in a particular activity, especially fighting in a war.

In &quot;ancien régime&quot; France it would be adopted by each new recruit (or assigned to them by the captain of their company) as they enlisted in the French army. These pseudonyms had an official character and were the predecessor of identification numbers: soldiers were identified by their first names, their family names, and their &quot;noms de guerre&quot; (e. g. &quot;Jean Amarault dit Lafidélité&quot;). These pseudonyms were usually related to the soldier&#x27;s place of origin (e. g. &quot;Jean Deslandes dit Champigny&quot;, for a soldier coming from a town named Champigny), or to a particular physical or personal trait (e. g. &quot;Antoine Bonnet dit Prettaboire&quot;, for a soldier &quot;prêt à boire&quot;, ready to drink). In 1716, a &quot;nom de guerre&quot; was mandatory for every soldier; officers did not adopt &quot;noms de guerre&quot; as they considered them derogatory. In daily life, these aliases could replace the real family name.

&quot;Noms de guerre&quot; were adopted for security reasons by members of World War II French Resistance and Polish resistance. Such pseudonyms are often adopted by military special-forces soldiers, such as members of the SAS and similar units of resistance fighters, terrorists, and guerrillas. This practice hides their identities and may protect their families from reprisals; it may also be a form of dissociation from domestic life.

Some well-known men who adopted &quot;noms de guerre&quot; include Ilich Ramírez Sánchez (Carlos the Jackal); Willy Brandt, Chancellor of West Germany; and Subcomandante Marcos, spokesman of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). During Lehi&#x27;s underground fight against the British in Mandatory Palestine, the organization&#x27;s commander Yitzhak Shamir (later Prime Minister of Israel) adopted the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Michael&quot;, in honour of Ireland&#x27;s Michael Collins. Pseudonym was also stylized as suedonim in a common misspelling of the original word so as to preserve the price of telegrams in World War I and II.

Revolutionaries and resistance leaders, such as Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Golda Meir, Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, and Josip Broz Tito, often adopted their &quot;noms de guerre&quot; as their proper names after the struggle. Georgios Grivas, the Greek-Cypriot EOKA militant, adopted the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Digenis (Διγενής). In the French Foreign Legion, recruits can adopt a pseudonym to break with their past lives. Mercenaries have long used &quot;noms de guerre&quot;, sometimes even multiple identities, depending on the country, conflict, and circumstance. Some of the most familiar noms de guerre today are the kunya used by Islamic State&#x27;s mujahideen and Al Qaeda members. These take the form of a teknonym, either literal or figurative.

Such war names have also been used in Africa. Part of the molding of child soldiers has included giving them such names. They were also used by fighters in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia, with some fighters retaining these names as their permanent names.

<text>Pea Ridge National Military Park is a United States National Military Park located in northwest Arkansas near the Missouri border. The park protects the site of the Battle of Pea Ridge, fought March 7 and 8, 1862. The battle was a victory for the Union and helped it gain control of the crucial border state of Missouri.

==Administrative history==

The Pea Ridge National Military Park was created by an act of Congress in 1956 to preserve the battlefield of the 1862 Battle of Pea Ridge. It was dedicated as a national park during the American Civil War Centennial in 1963.

In 1956, the Arkansas congressional delegation proposed legislation to make Pea Ridge a national military park. This was a significant breakthrough in American Civil War battlefield preservation. At that time, under the National Park Service classification system, only should have been preserved, along with a monument. On July 20, 1956, Congress enacted legislation to accept a donation from the state of Arkansas.

In acquiring the land for the park, the government purchased or used eminent domain on dozens of farms and residences of various sizes, ranging from a few acres to the large Winton Springs estate. Many houses and structures were sold and moved off of park property, including some standing in nearby Pea Ridge. The park demolished all remaining structures, including the elaborate Winton Springs mansion, except for the historic Elkhorn Tavern.

Many Union and Confederate veterans attended several reunions at the Pea Ridge battlefield long before it was a park. The first reunions were held in 1887, twenty-five years after the battle. The reunions promoted both remembrance and healing between the soldiers in each army. The veterans dedicated the first battlefield monuments to the Union and Confederate dead. Historian David W. Blight notes in his book &quot;Race and Reunion&quot; that in such postwar reconciliation, outstanding issues related to the condition and future of freedmen and racial justice were overlooked. These monuments are still located within the park today.

==Visiting the park==
The park is acknowledged as one of the best-preserved Civil War battlefields. The park features a visitor center and museum, a driving tour, the restored battlefields, hiking trails, a portion of the pre-war Old Telegraph/Wire Road, approximately of the Trail of Tears as followed by some members of the Cherokee Nation, and the restored Elkhorn Tavern, which was the epicenter of much of the battle.

<doc id="313398" wikidata="Q691858" url="?curid=313398" title="Wingtip device">
<text>Wingtip devices are intended to improve the efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft by reducing drag. Although there are several types of wing tip devices which function in different manners, their intended effect is always to reduce an aircraft&#x27;s drag. Wingtip devices can also improve aircraft handling characteristics and enhance safety for following aircraft. Such devices increase the effective aspect ratio of a wing without greatly increasing the wingspan. Extending the span would lower lift-induced drag, but would increase parasitic drag and would require boosting the strength and weight of the wing. At some point, there is no net benefit from further increased span. There may also be operational considerations that limit the allowable wingspan (e.g., available width at airport gates).

Wingtip devices help prevent the flow around the wingtip of higher pressure air under the wing flowing to the lower pressure surface on top at the wingtip, which results in a vortex caused by the forward motion of the aircraft. Winglets also reduce the lift-induced drag caused by wingtip vortices and improve lift-to-drag ratio. This increases fuel efficiency in powered aircraft and increases cross-country speed in gliders, in both cases increasing range. U.S. Air Force studies indicate that a given improvement in fuel efficiency correlates directly with the causal increase in the aircraft&#x27;s lift-to-drag ratio.

== Early history ==

===Wing end-plates===

The initial concept dates back to 1897, when English engineer Frederick W. Lanchester patented wing end-plates as a method for controlling wingtip vortices. In the United States, Scottish-born engineer William E. Somerville patented the first functional winglets in 1910. Somerville installed the devices on his early biplane and monoplane designs. Vincent Burnelli received US Patent no: 1,774,474 for his &quot;Airfoil Control Means&quot; on August 26, 1930.

Simple flat end-plates did not cause a reduction in drag, because the increase in profile drag was greater than the decrease in induced drag.

===Hoerner wing tips===
Following the end of World War II, Dr. Sighard F. Hoerner was a pioneer researcher in the field, having written a technical paper published in 1952 that called for drooped wingtips whose pointed rear tips focused the resulting wingtip vortex away from the upper wing surface. Drooped wingtips are often called &quot;Hoerner tips&quot; in his honor. Gliders and light aircraft have made use of Hoerner tips for many years.

The earliest-known implementation of a Hoerner-style downward-angled &quot;wingtip device&quot; on a jet aircraft was during World War II. This was the so-called &quot;Lippisch-Ohren&quot; (Lippisch-ears), allegedly attributed to the Messerschmitt Me 163&#x27;s designer Alexander Lippisch, and first added to the M3 and M4 third and fourth prototypes of the Heinkel He 162A &quot;Spatz&quot; jet light fighter for evaluation. This addition was done in order to counteract the dutch roll characteristic present in the original He 162 design, related to its wings having a marked dihedral angle. This became a standard feature of the approximately 320 completed He 162A jet fighters built, with hundreds more He 162A airframes going unfinished by V-E Day.

== Winglet ==

The term &quot;winglet&quot; was previously used to describe an additional lifting surface on an aircraft, like a short section between wheels on fixed undercarriage. Richard Whitcomb&#x27;s research in the 1970s at NASA first used winglet with its modern meaning referring to near-vertical extension of the wing tips. The upward angle (or &quot;cant&quot;) of the winglet, its inward or outward angle (or &quot;toe&quot;), as well as its size and shape are critical for correct performance and are unique in each application. The wingtip vortex, which rotates around from below the wing, strikes the cambered surface of the winglet, generating a force that angles inward and slightly forward, analogous to a sailboat sailing close hauled. The winglet converts some of the otherwise-wasted energy in the wingtip vortex to an apparent thrust. This small contribution can be worthwhile over the aircraft&#x27;s lifetime, provided the benefit offsets the cost of installing and maintaining the winglets.

Another potential benefit of winglets is that they reduce the intensity of wake vortices. Those trail behind the plane and pose a hazard to other aircraft. Minimum spacing requirements between aircraft operations at airports are largely dictated by these factors. Aircraft are classified by weight (e.g. &quot;Light&quot;, &quot;Heavy&quot;, etc.) because the vortex strength grows with the aircraft lift coefficient, and thus, the associated turbulence is greatest at low speed and high weight, which produced a high angle of attack.

Winglets and wingtip fences also increase efficiency by reducing vortex interference with laminar airflow near the tips of the wing, by &#x27;moving&#x27; the confluence of low-pressure (over wing) and high-pressure (under wing) air away from the surface of the wing. Wingtip vortices create turbulence, originating at the leading edge of the wingtip and propagating backwards and inboard. This turbulence &#x27;delaminates&#x27; the airflow over a small triangular section of the outboard wing, which destroys lift in that area. The fence/winglet drives the area where the vortex forms upward away from the wing surface, since the center of the resulting vortex is now at the tip of the winglet.

The fuel economy improvement from winglets increases with the mission length. Blended winglets allow a steeper angle of attack reducing takeoff distance.

=== Early development ===

Richard T. Whitcomb, an engineer at NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center, further developed Hoerner&#x27;s concept in response to the sharp increase in the cost of fuel after the 1973 oil crisis. With careful aeronautical design he showed that, for a given bending moment, a near-vertical winglet offers a greater drag reduction compared to a horizontal span extension. Whitcomb&#x27;s designs were flight-tested in 1979–80 by a joint NASA/Air Force team, using a KC-135 Stratotanker based at the Dryden Flight Research Center. A Lockheed L-1011 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 were also used for testing, and the latter design was directly implemented by McDonnell Douglas on the derivative MD-11, which was rolled out in 1990.

In May 1983, a high school student at Bowie High School in Maryland won a grand prize at the 34th International Science and Engineering Fair in Albuquerque, New Mexico for the result of his research on wingtip devices to reduce drag. The same month, he filed a U.S. patent for &quot;wingtip airfoils&quot;, published in 1986.

===Applications===
==== Business aircraft ====
Learjet exhibited the prototype Learjet 28 at the 1977 National Business Aviation Association convention. It employed the first winglets ever used on a production aircraft, either civilian or military. Learjet developed the winglet design without NASA assistance. Although the Model 28 was intended to be a prototype experimental aircraft, performance was such that it resulted in a production commitment from Learjet. Flight tests showed that the winglets increased range by about 6.5 percent and improved directional stability. Learjet&#x27;s application of winglets to production aircraft continued with newer models including the Learjet 55, 31, 60, 45, and Learjet 40.

Gulfstream Aerospace explored winglets in the late 1970s and incorporated winglets in the Gulfstream III, Gulfstream IV and Gulfstream V. The Gulfstream V range of allows nonstop routes such as New York–Tokyo, it holds over 70 world and national flight records.
The Rutan combined winglets-vertical stabilizer appeared on his Beechcraft Starship business aircraft design that first flew in 1986.

Winglets are also applied to other business aircraft, reducing take-off distance to operate from smaller airports, and allowing higher cruise altitudes. Along winglets on new designs, aftermarket vendors developed retrofits. Winglet Technology, LLC of Wichita, Kansas should have tested its elliptical winglets designed to increase payload-range on hot and high departures to retrofit the Citation X.

==== Experimental ====
Conventional winglets were fitted to Rutan&#x27;s Rutan Voyager, the first aircraft to circumnavigate the world without refueling in 1986. The aircraft&#x27;s wingtips were damaged, however, when they dragged along the runway during takeoff, removing about from each wingtip, so the flight was made without benefit of winglets.

==== Airliner fuel efficiency ====
The average commercial jet sees a 4-6 percent increase in fuel efficiency and as much as a 6% decrease in in-flight noise from the use of winglets. Actual fuel savings and the related carbon output can vary significantly by plane, route and flight conditions.

==== Wingtip fence ====
A wingtip fence refers to the winglets including surfaces extending both above and below the wingtip, as described in Whitcomb&#x27;s early research. Both surfaces are shorter than or equivalent to a winglet possessing similar aerodynamic benefits. The Airbus A310-300 was the first airliner with wingtip fences in 1985. Other Airbus models followed with the A300-600, the A320ceo, and the A380. Other Airbus models including the Airbus A320 Enhanced, A320neo, A350 and A330neo have blended winglets rather than wingtip fences. The Antonov An-158 uses wingtip fences.

==== Canted winglets ====
Boeing announced a new version of the 747, the 747-400, in 1985, with an extended range and capacity, using a combination of winglets and increased span to carry the additional load. The winglets increased the 747-400&#x27;s range by 3.5% over the 747-300, which is otherwise aerodynamically identical but has no winglets. The 747-400D variant lacks the wingtip extensions and winglets included on other 747-400s since winglets would provide minimal benefits on short-haul routes while adding extra weight and cost, although the -400D may be converted to the long-range version if needed. Winglets are preferred for Boeing derivative designs based on existing platforms, because they allow maximum re-use of existing components. Newer designs are favoring increased span, other wingtip devices or a combination of both, whenever possible.

The Ilyushin Il-96 was the first Russian and modern jet to feature winglets in 1988. The Bombardier CRJ-100/200 was the first regional airliner to feature winglets in 1992. The A340/A330 followed with canted winglets in 1993/1994. The Tupolev Tu-204 was the first narrowbody aircraft to feature winglets in 1994. The Airbus A220 (née CSeries), from 2016, has canted winglets. 

==== Blended winglets ====
A blended winglet is attached to the wing with a smooth curve instead of a sharp angle and is intended to reduce interference drag at the wing/winglet junction. A sharp interior angle in this region can interact with the boundary layer flow causing a drag inducing vortex, negating some of the benefit of the winglet. Seattle-based Aviation Partners develops blended winglets as retrofits for the Gulfstream II, Hawker 800 and the Falcon 2000.

On February 18, 2000, blended winglets were announced as an option for the Boeing 737-800; the first shipset was installed on 14 February 2001 and entered revenue service with Hapag-Lloyd Flug on 8 May 2001. The Aviation Partners/Boeing extensions decrease fuel consumption by 4% for long-range flights and increase range by for the 737-800 or the derivative Boeing Business Jet as standard. Also offered for the 737 Classic, many operators have retrofitted their fleets with these for the fuel savings. Aviation Partners Boeing also offers blended winglets for the 757 and 767-300ER. In 2006 Airbus tested two candidate blended winglets, designed by Winglet Technology and Airbus for the Airbus A320 family. In 2009 Airbus launched its &quot;Sharklet&quot; blended winglet, designed to enhance the payload-range of its A320 family and reduce fuel burn by up to 4% over longer sectors. This corresponds to an annual CO2 reduction of 700 tonnes per aircraft. The A320s fitted with Sharklets were delivered beginning in 2012. They are used on the A320neo, the A330neo and the A350. They are also offered as a retrofit option.

==== Raked wingtip ====

Raked wingtips, where the tip has a greater wing sweep than the rest of the wing, are featured on some Boeing Commercial Airplanes to improve fuel efficiency, takeoff and climb performance. Like winglets, they increase the effective wing aspect ratio and diminish wingtip vortices, decreasing lift-induced drag. In testing by Boeing and NASA, they reduce drag by as much as 5.5%, compared to 3.5% to 4.5% for conventional winglets. While an increase in span would be more effective than a same-length winglet, its bending moment is greater. A winglet gives the performance gain of a span increase but has the bending force of a span increase.

Raked wingtips offer several weight-reduction advantages relative to simply extending the conventional main wingspan. At high load-factor structural design conditions, the smaller chords of the wingtip are subjected to less load, and they result in less induced loading on the outboard main wing. Additionally, the leading-edge sweep results in the center of pressure being located farther aft than for simple extensions of the span of conventional main wings. At high load factors, this relative aft location of the center of pressure causes the raked wingtip to be twisted more leading-edge down, reducing the bending moment on the inboard wing. However, the relative aft-movement of the center of pressure accentuates flutter.

Raked wingtips are installed on the Boeing 767-400ER (first flight on October 9, 1999), all generations of Boeing 777 (June 12, 1994) including the upcoming 777X, the 737-derived Boeing P-8 Poseidon (25 April 2009), all variants of the Boeing 787 (December 15, 2009) (the cancelled Boeing 787-3 would have had a wingspan to fit in ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code D, as its wingspan was decreased by using blended winglets instead of raked wingtips ), and the Boeing 747-8 (February 8, 2010). The Embraer E-jet E2 and C-390 Millennium wings also have raked wingtips.

==== Split-tip ====
The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was the first aircraft with split-tip winglets in 1990.

For the 737 Next Generation, third-party vendor Aviation Partners has introduced a similar design to the 737 MAX wingtip device known as the split scimitar winglet, with United Airlines as the launch customer.

The Boeing 737 MAX uses a new type of wingtip device. Resembling a three-way hybrid of a winglet, wingtip fence, and raked wingtip, Boeing claims that this new design should deliver an additional 1.5% improvement in fuel economy over the 10-12% improvement already expected from the 737 MAX.

==== Gliders ====
In 1987, mechanical engineer Peter Masak called on aerodynamicist Mark D. Maughmer, an associate professor of aerospace engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, about designing winglets to improve performance on his wingspan racing sailplane. Others had attempted to apply Whitcomb&#x27;s winglets to gliders before, and they did improve climb performance, but this did not offset the parasitic drag penalty in high-speed cruise. Masak was convinced it was possible to overcome this hurdle. By trial and error, they ultimately developed successful winglet designs for gliding competitions, using a new PSU–90–125 airfoil, designed by Maughmer specifically for the winglet application. At the 1991 World Gliding Championships in Uvalde, Texas, the trophy for the highest speed went to a winglet-equipped 15-meter class limited wingspan glider, exceeding the highest speed in the unlimited span Open Class, an exceptional result. Masak went on to win the 1993 U.S. 15 Meter Nationals gliding competition, using winglets on his prototype Masak Scimitar.
The Masak winglets were originally retrofitted to production sailplanes, but within 10 years of their introduction, most high-performance gliders were equipped from the factory with winglets or other wingtip devices. It took over a decade for winglets to first appear on a production airliner, the original application that was the focus of the NASA development. Yet, once the advantages of winglets were proven in competition, adoption was swift with gliders. The point difference between the winner and the runner-up in soaring competition is often less than one percent, so even a small improvement in efficiency is a significant competitive advantage. Many non-competition pilots fitted winglets for handling benefits such as increased roll rate and roll authority and reduced tendency for wing tip stall. The benefits are notable, because sailplane winglets must be removable to allow the glider to be stored in a trailer, so they are usually installed only at the pilot&#x27;s preference.

The Glaser-Dirks DG-303, an early glider derivative design, incorporating winglets as factory standard equipment.

Aviation Partners developed and flight tested a closed-surface Spiroid winglet on a Falcon 50 in 2010.

Non-planar wingtips are normally angled upwards in a polyhedral wing configuration, increasing the local dihedral near the wing tip, with polyhedral wing designs themselves having been popular on free-flight model aircraft designs for decades. Non-planar wingtips provide the wake control benefit of winglets, with less parasitic drag penalty, if designed carefully. The non-planar wing tip is often swept back like a raked wingtip and may also be combined with a winglet. A winglet is also a special case of a non-planar wingtip.

Aircraft designers employed mostly planar wing designs with simple dihedral after World War II, prior to the introduction of winglets. With the wide acceptance of winglets in new sailplane designs of the 1990s, designers sought to further optimize the aerodynamic performance of their wingtip designs. Glider winglets were originally retrofitted directly to planar wings, with only a small, nearly right-angle, transition area. Once the performance of the winglet itself was optimized, attention was turned to the transition between the wing and winglet. A common application was tapering the transition area from the wing tip chord to the winglet chord and raking the transition area back, to place the winglet in the optimal position. If the tapered portion was canted upward, the winglet height could also be reduced. Eventually, designers employed multiple non-planar sections, each canting up at a greater angle, dispensing with the winglets entirely.

The Schempp-Hirth Discus-2 and Schempp-Hirth Duo Discus use non-planar wingtips.

== Active wingtip device ==

Tamarack Aerospace Group, a company founded in 2010 by aerospace structural engineer Nicholas Guida, has patented an Active Technology Load Alleviation System (ATLAS), a modified version of a wingtip device. The system uses Tamarack Active Camber Surfaces (TACS) to aerodynamically &quot;switch off&quot; the effects of the wingtip device when the aircraft is experiencing high-g events such as large gusts or severe pull-ups. TACS are movable panels, similar to flaps or ailerons, on the trailing edge of the wing extension. The system is controlled by the aircraft&#x27;s electrical system and a high-speed servo which is activated when the aircraft senses an oncoming stress event, essentially simulating an actuating wingtip. However, the wingtip itself is fixed and the TACS are the only moving part of the wingtip system. Tamarack first introduced ATLAS for the Cessna Citation family aircraft, and it has been certified for use by the Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency.

In December 2024, Tamarack Aerospace had installed 200 Active Winglet on CitationJet airplanes.

== Actuating wingtip device ==
There has been research into actuating wingtip devices, including a filed patent application, though no aircraft currently uses this feature as described. The XB-70 Valkyrie&#x27;s wingtips were capable of drooping downward in flight, to facilitate Mach 3 flight using waveriding.

== Use on rotating blades ==

Wingtip devices are also used on rotating propeller, helicopter rotor, and wind turbine blades to reduce drag, reduce diameter, reduce noise and/or improve efficiency. By reducing aircraft blade tip vortices interacting with the ground surface during taxiing, takeoff, and hover, these devices can reduce damage from dirt and small stones picked up in the vortices.

=== Rotorcraft applications ===

The main rotor blades of the AgustaWestland AW101 (formerly the EH101) have a distinctive tip shape; pilots have found that this rotor design alters the downwash field and reduces brownout which limits visibility in dusty areas and leads to accidents.

=== Propeller applications ===
Hartzell Propeller developed their &quot;Q-tip&quot; propeller used on the Piper PA-42 Cheyenne and several other fixed-wing aircraft types by bending the blade tips back at a 90-degree angle to get the same thrust from a reduced diameter propeller disk; the reduced propeller tip speed reduces noise, according to the manufacturer. Modern scimitar propellers have increased sweepback at the tips, resembling a raked tip on an aircraft wing.

=== Other applications ===
Some ceiling fans have wingtip devices. Fan manufacturer Big Ass Fans has claimed that their Isis fan, equipped with wingtip devices, has superior efficiency. However, for certain high-volume, low-speed designs, wingtip devices may not improve efficiency.
Another application of the same principle was introduced to the keel of the &quot;America&#x27;s Cup&quot;- winning Australian yacht Australia II of 1982, designed by Ben Lexcen.

<doc id="313401" wikidata="Q116256909" url="?curid=313401" title="Traditional music of Korea">
<text>Korea has produced music () for thousands of years, into the modern day. After the division of Korea in 1945, both North and South Korea have produced their own styles of music.

Traditional music () produced by Korea includes court music, folk music, poetic songs, and religious music used in shamanistic and Buddhist traditions.

Modern music includes K-pop (), the popular music of South Korea. North Korea also produces its own popular music, as well as music that&#x27;s inspired by traditional music.

==History==

=== Proto-Three Kingdoms of Korea ===
Not much is known about music from the Proto-Three Kingdoms of Korea period (before 57 BCE). It is believed that Korean people practiced shamanistic rituals involving music at agricultural festivals. Tomb murals and ceramics from this period depict string instruments with complex features that suggest the instruments were quite developed.

=== Three Kingdoms of Korea ===
The Three Kingdoms of Korea refers to the period from 57 BCE to 668 CE when the Korean peninsula was ruled by three kingdoms: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla. Each kingdom was known for favoring different musical instruments.

==== Goguryeo ====
In Goguryeo, an oboe called a &quot;piri&quot;, a lute called a &quot;pipa&quot;, and a zither that is still used today called a &quot;geomungo&quot; were popular instruments. According to the Korean historical record &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, written in 1145, the &quot;geomungo&quot; was invented by prime minister Wang San-ak, who had received a Chinese zither called a &quot;guqin&quot; as a gift. Wang did not know how to play the &quot;guqin&quot; so he used it as a model in order to build a new instrument he called the &quot;geomungo.&quot; A painting of the instrument is found in a tomb in modern-day Jilin Province, China.

The Chinese historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; noted &quot;The people of Goguryeo like to sing and dance. Men and women in villages throughout the country gather every night to sing and dance.&quot; Surviving songs from the era include, &quot;Song of the Turtle&quot;, and &quot;Song of Nightingales&quot;, the latter of which was sung by King Yuri of Goguryeo.

==== Baekje ====
The only song of Baekje conveyed until now is Jeongeupsa (), but since there are no specific relics such as the mural tombs of Goguryeo, it is quite difficult to grasp what it would be like. It is evident that Baekje also celebrated a harvest festival in May and October similar to that of Goguryeo.

The music of Baekje was known to Liu Song dynasty and Northern Wei, while some music players were invited to Japan. Notably, a man of Baekje named Mimaji () learned music and dance in China and emigrated to Japan in 612.

==== Silla ====

Before Silla unified three kingdoms, the music of Silla is represented by a traditional instrument, gayageum which was said that Ureuk from Gaya brought it in the reign of King Jinheung when his kingdoms were incorporated by Silla forces. Although &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; conveys 12 names of compositions Ureuk did, those are not fully inherited. In the 13th year of Jinheung, Ureuk taught gayageum, songs, and dances to three disciples of Gyego, Beopji y Mandeok.

Later the famed scholar, Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn who studied in Tang dynasty away from bone rank system of Silla chartered five poems of &quot;hyangak&quot; (The local music) which depict performing arts in Silla toward the end of its era. These figures are found in history books, Goryeosa as a court ballet performance consisting of hyangak and dangak in subcategories of Korean music.

===North and South States period===

====Unified Silla====
After unification, the music of Silla experienced the influx of diverse music from Baekje and Goguryeo with the wider development of hyangak, especially in gayageum, geomungo, bipa of three string instruments and other three pipes. Additionally, music from the Tang dynasty was introduced under the reign of King Munmu. The Buddhist chant, Beompae (hangul 범패, hanja 梵唄) was widely adopted with variety of instruments, forming a unique art of Silla. During unified Silla, the royal institute of music (en hangul: 음성서) was established.

===Goryeo dynasty===
Taejo of Goryeo, the founder of Goryeo followed several customs of Silla which can be found in a series of Buddhist celebrations such as Palgwanhoe and Yeondeunghoe. However, the influence of Silla dramatically diminished in the middle of its period owing to the influx of music from Song, establishing a strong influence on Korean court music. A large banquet where performances handed down from Silla such as the sword dance was conducted. Most of Goryeo songs were recorded in Akhak gwebeom after the 15th century of which features were the lyrics of the Korean language, different from those of previous eras.

Goryeo court dance named jeongjae can be divided into two categories: native dances of hyangak jeongjae (); Tang-derived dangak jeongjae (). Additionally, folk dances were practiced by monks and shamans.

=== Joseon dynasty ===
As Yi Seong-gye founded Joseon in 1392, the dynasty adopted anti-Buddhism and pro-Confucianism which affected the musical pattern of Yeak (). Although some scholars like Jeong Do-jeon made several songs for celebrating the initial moments of Joseon, the notation followed the trends of Goryeo.

Joseon periods saw considerable developments of its music during the reign of Sejong which were largely attributable to a musician Park Yeon. Park firstly established an independent organ of music and created Korean-style notation including Jeonganbo (en Hangul: 정간보). King Sejong himself also composed songs. A son of Sejong, Sejo who killed his nephew, Danjong also recorded his score in pitch pipe notation. The two kings above are the only rulers whose musical records are now traceable.

Music and dance enjoyed favorable positions in the court banquets and also within the elite yangban class. The feasts hosted by high-rank officers involved several entertainers like clowns and acrobats. After the middle of its period, what-so-called middlemen (중인, Jungin) came to play diverse instruments mixing lyric poems and long cyclical songs.
The process of compiling traditional Korean music continued until the reign of Seongjong with the publication of the first independent musical text Akhakgwebeom.

Because of two damaging wars, the culture of Joseon went through a series of hardships which resulted in the loss of instrumental music and songs in court and also a royal shrine. The musical situation in the late Joseon can be described as declining contrary to its expansion period.

Ancestor worship ceremonies called Munmyo jerye and Jongmyo jerye were revived and performed annually, chiefly to commemorate the deaths of Confucian scholars and Korean kings.

The public enjoyed the genre of pansori, sanjo and namsadang-nori. Pansori first emerged as a common culture in the mid-Joseon. Although it is hard to grasp exact points of its evolution, the oral tradition of this genre came to be followed by musical experts only to expand its sphere not only to commoners but also to aristocrats.

In 1894, Joseon government dispatched ten court musicians to Boston Exposition in the United States to build an independent foundation.

===After Korean Empire===
Joseon was transformed into the Korean Empire with a view to organizing its sphere out of the external interruption, while the rituals of empires were revived and practiced Confucian court music to celebrate the expansion of the nation. However, the Japanese colonization of Korea in 1910 brought tremendous change inside and outside Korea with an influence of western music. After the collapse, Korean court music found almost no way to make celebrations and rituals, which was replaced with marching songs. Instead of pansori and gagok, the musical trends were largely changed into modern-style performances and classical music. Followed by cultural suppression in the 1920s, Korean traditional music barely survived.

During the 1930s, despite suppression of folk music, there was some support for some singers. In January 1934 Wang Su-bok was featured in the first live Korean language radio broadcast to Japan. The transmission was organised by the Japanese Broadcasting Corporation, and she was accompanied by Kyongsong Broadcasting Orchestra.

==Korean voice (sori/chang) ==


&lt;br&gt;
Korean folk song or &quot;minyo&quot;, is varied and complex, but all forms maintain a set of rhythms (called 장단; Jangdan) and a loosely defined set of melodic modes owing to diverse instruments, while even drums were eligible to demonstrate a variety of rhythmic cycles.

Because the folk songs of various areas are categorized under Dongbu folk songs, their vocal styles and modes are limited. Therefore, currently, scholars are attempting to categorize the Dongbu folk songs further, based on different musical features. These songs are primarily simple and bright. Namdo folk songs are those of Jeolla Province and a part of Chungcheong Province. While the folk songs of other regions are mostly musically simple, the folk songs of the Namdo region, where the famous musical genres &quot;pansori&quot; and &quot;sanjo&quot; were created, are rich and dramatic. Some Namdo folk songs are used in pansori or developed by professional singers and are included as part of their repertoires. Jeju folk songs are sung on Jeju Island. Jeju folk songs are more abundant in number than any other regional folk songs, and approximately 1600 songs are transmitted today. Jeju folk songs are characterized by their simple and unique melodic lines and rich texts.

===Pansori===
&quot;Pansori&quot; () is a long vocal and percussive music played by one singer and 1 drummer. In this traditional art form, sometimes rather misleadingly called &#x27;Korean Opera&#x27;, a narrator may play the parts of all the characters in a story, accompanied by a drummer. The lyrics tell one of five different stories but are individualized by each performer, often with updated jokes and audience participation. One of the most famous pansori singers is Park Dongjin (). In 2003, Pansori was designated as intangible cultural property in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the world.

The National Theatre of Korea provides monthly opportunities to experience traditional Korean narrative songs or &quot;Pansori&quot;.

===Pungmul===
&quot;Pungmul&quot; () is a Korean folk music tradition that is a form of percussion music that includes drumming, dancing, and singing. Most performances are outside, with dozens of players, all in constant motion. Samul Nori, originally the name of a musical group founded in 1978, has become popular as a genre, even overseas. It is based on Pungmul musical rhythmic patterns and uses the same instruments, but is faster and usually played while sitting down.

===Sanjo===
Sanjo () is played without a pause in faster tempos as one of the most popular genres of traditional Korean music. It is entirely instrumental music, and includes changes in rhythmic and melodic modes during individual work. The tempo increases in each movement. The general style of the sanjo is marked by slides in slow movements and rhythmic complexity in faster movements. Instruments include the changgo drum set against a melodic instrument, such as the gayageum or ajaeng. Famous practitioners include such names as Kim Chukp&#x27;a, Yi Saenggang and Hwang Byungki. Notably, Hwang established a new type of sanjo genre that involved in the repertory of gayageum on the basis of aiming to identify and explain distinctive musical features and creativity.

===Jeongak===
Jeongak () or &quot;Chongak&quot; means literally &quot;right (or proper) music&quot;, and its tradition includes both instrumental and vocal music, which were cultivated mainly by the upper-class literati of the Joseon society. The instrumental branch has several versions of a lengthy chamber, chiefly &quot;Yongsan hoesang&quot;, while the vocal branch sometimes include the meaning of jeongga (Right Song) with a wide range of gagok, gasa, and sijo.

Although jeongak has things in common with court music but it cannot be categorized as popular song since most public would never hear of these melodies by incorporating various court dances. Vocals performed in jeongak are normally sung in a style of kagok (), which is for mixed male and female singers and is accompanied by a variety of instruments. The best-known piece of jeongak is &quot;Yeongsan hoesang&quot; of 9 suites which has now had only instrumental notes.

===Nongak===

Nongak () refers to &quot;farmers&#x27; music&quot; and represents an important musical genre which has been developed mainly by peasants in the agricultural society of Korea. The farmers&#x27; music is performed typically in an open area of the village. The organization of nongak varies according to locality and performing groups, and today there are a great number of regional styles and involvement of many instruments. Since Nongak involves in many types of dances and formation changes, the dancers and players have several types of artistic format due to their level of skill.

===Shinawi===
Shinawi or Sinawi (), means, in the broadest sense, the shamanistic music of Korea which is performed during a Korean shaman&#x27;s ritual dance performance to console and to entertain deities mainly from Korea&#x27;s southwest region. In this sense of the word, the term is almost identical with another term, &quot;shinbanggok&quot; (lit. &#x27;spirit chamber music&#x27;), which indicated general shamanistic music performed at a folk religious ceremony known as kut. The format of this genre is comparatively loose with several dancers being united and dispersed on the stage.

===Salpuri===
Salpuri dance () is a shamanistic ritual dance, conducted as exorcism of bad ghosts. The style of this ritual dance is characterized simple and serene. The long scarf with fluid lines express long lines of the arms and fingers of the dancer from corner to corner of the space, utilizing the vastness of space all the way.

==Court music==
Korean court music preserved to date can be traced to the beginning of the Joseon period in 1392. It is now rare, except for government-sponsored organizations like The National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts.

There are three types of court music.

*Aak is an imported form of Chinese ritual music.
*Hyang-ak is a Pure Korean form.
*Dang-ak is a combination of Korean and Chinese influences.

===Aak===
The word Aak is the Korean pronunciation of two hanja characters, which indicate the equivalent form of &quot;yayue&quot; in Chinese and &quot;gagaku&quot; in Japan. Since Confucius used this term to distinguish elegant and beneficial music from the melodies without harmony, it enjoyed favorable status during Joseon. Derived from wider types of notations, Korea has maintained its melodies until now of which features were long lost in China. Aak is considered a special type of court music in specific ritual ceremonies at very rare concerts, such as the Sacrifice to Confucius in Seoul.

===Dang-ak===
Dangak or Tangak refers to the music which came from the Tang dynasty. The instruments from Tang were imported. During the 12th century, Korea received musical instruments as gifts from the Chinese ruler, which were used by the orchestra at Confucian rituals. These influences provided Unified Silla with robust opportunities to develop its music culture after Korean performers&#x27; visits to China and vice versa Chinese performers visited Korea in 1116.

===Hyang-ak===
Hyangak literally means &quot;The local music&quot; or &quot;Music native to Korea&quot; of which one example is &quot;Sujecheon&quot;, a piece of instrumental music as old as 1,300 years. Hyangak firstly appeared as early as during Silla period with four ensemble stringed instrument with woodwind instruments similar to the oboe, called a piri. Pares and English indicate the texts of Goryeosa: The most significant dates for music hyangak (indigenous music; other texts refer to this as sogak) were 1114 and 1116, when the court received two gifts from the eighth Song emperor, Huizong. Korea was fast becoming a Confucian state and kings had begun to observe Confucian rites to heaven, to agriculture, land and grain, and to royal ancestors.

Yongbieocheonga, Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven represents its uniqueness as hyangak, which was originally tuned to various notes and lyrics but the text was lost and purely instrument rhythm left.

==Military music==
===Daechwita===
==Traditional instruments==
Traditional Korean instruments can be broadly divided into three groups:

#String
#Wind
#Percussion

Percussion folk instruments include jing (large hanging gong), kkwaenggwari (hand-held gong), buk (barrel drum), janggu (hourglass drum). Percussion court includes the pyeongjong (bronze bells), pyeongyeong (stone chimes), chuk (square wooden box with mallet) and eo (tiger-shaped scraper).

<text>The music of South Korea has evolved over the course of the decades since the end of the Korean War, and has its roots in the music of the Korean people, who have inhabited the Korean peninsula for over a millennium. Contemporary South Korean music can be divided into three different main categories: Traditional Korean folk music, popular music, or K-pop, and Western-influenced non-popular music.

== Traditional music ==

Korean traditional music is also known as Gugak (national music). The first evidence of Korean music appeared in the extant text of Samguk sagi (History of the three kingdoms) in 1145, which described two string-like instruments; Gayageum and Geomungo. Traditional Korean music was brought to heights of excellence under the kings of the Joseon dynasty between 1392 and 1897. During the Joseon period, a social hierarchy was observed with the King and the &quot;yangban&quot; (government officials, generals, and the elite) at the top and the &quot;sangmin&quot; (merchants, craftsman) and slaves at the bottom. There were two forms of music: &quot;jeongak&quot; (court music) and &quot;minsokak&quot; (folk music). &quot;Jeongak&quot; was the music category that the &quot;yangban&quot; listened to for enjoyment and was played during state rituals like banquets, military processions, etc. However, &quot;minsokak&quot; and &quot;nongak&quot; (farmer&#x27;s music) dominated among the common people. The different types of folk music were: &quot;pansori&quot;, &quot;pungmulnori&quot;, and &quot;minyo&quot; (folk songs). &quot;Pansori&quot; became definite in the seventeenth century and gained respect over time. It is now considered as the ideal traditional music in contemporary South Korea. &quot;Pansori&quot; requires a solo singer as well as a drummer. This type of music contains body language, emotions, and sounds observed in nature. &quot;Pungmulnori&quot; is traditional Korean percussion music with the sound of drums standing out. As for &quot;minyo&quot;, it was enjoyed by commoners while &quot;nongak&quot; was played during agrarian festivals. Folk songs were not specific; as in, the features varied among different regions. The most famous folk song of South- and North Korea is &quot;Arirang&quot;. The popularity of this song sky-rocketed after it was sung solo at the screening of a silent nationalistic film produced by Na Woongyu in 1926. There are several regional variations of this song.

However, the Joseon Dynasty came to an end after Japan&#x27;s successful war against China (1894–1895) and Russia (1904–1905) which ultimately took over the Korean peninsula. Japan then controlled the major levers of politics, economics, and culture in Korea. During this period, the Japanese did not impose gagaku (the Japanese imperial court music) but European art music instead. Western music education soon became a part of the Korean educational curriculum for the elite and included choral singing and playing instruments. Hence, the Japanese and Korean elites embraced Western music; thereby neglecting Gugak. However, to avoid going extinct Gugak adapted the western style of music. In the 1900s, Pansori gave rise to a new genre influenced by western music called Changga (choral song/theater) which gave way to musical theaters and opera. Since Western music was not accessible to the common people, two different cultural groups arose; one where the elite listened to the government-imposed western music and as for the commoners, traditional music. This led to a new generation, often termed as &#x27;modernized&#x27;, who were accustomed to listening to Western music.

Since the early 2000s, there have been continuous attempts by traditional musicians to combine Gugak with popular music genres, which soon became known as &quot;Fusion Gugak&quot; (). Following the viral success of band LEENALCHI&#x27;s &quot;Tiger Is Coming&quot; () being featured in the Korean Tourism Organization&#x27;s &quot;Feel the Rhythm of Korea&quot; video advertising series with Ambiguous Dance Company in 2020, interest in the genre increased. Fusion gugak survival shows like JTBC&#x27;s &quot;Captain of Poong-New&quot; and MBN&#x27;s &quot;Chosun Pan Star&quot; soon emerged, with many highly respected musicians within the Gugak scene participating as contestants and judges.

== Western influenced music ==
Western influenced Korean music is also sometimes referred to as popular music and is seen in the early twentieth century. The western influence in South Korean music gave rise to new genres; some of which are Changga and Yuhaengga.

Changga arose from Pansori but became increasingly popular in the early twentieth century for its fusion of European anthems, American hymns, Western folk tunes, and Japanese choral music. Though it had Western melodies, the lyrics were in Korean. The most well-known example of changga is the song &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;.

Yuhaengga (which literally means popular songs) is also known as shin gayo (new song). It became a part of everyday life in urban Korea in the mid–1920s as well as a crucial element of the term &quot;modern&quot;.

==Mainstream popular music==
Popular Korean music, often referred to as K-pop in English, is a highly commercial industry throughout Asia. The dominant trend in popular Korean music is currently &quot;idol&quot; () groups, though far from all Korean popular music artists are idols. Idol groups typically feature several entertainers of the same gender who perform a fusion of dance music, rhythm and blues, funk, hip-hop and electronic influenced songs. Contemporary Korean music and K-pop stars are very popular across Asia, and the spread of contemporary Korean culture designated a word to reflect this fact. The Korean Wave, or &quot;Hallyu&quot; (), is the word used to discuss the influence of contemporary Korean popular culture on the rest of Asia, and the rest of the world.

===Genres===
====Trot====
Trot, pronounced as &quot;teuroteu&quot; in Korean (sometimes called &quot;ppongjjak&quot; (), due to its distinctive background rhythm), is the oldest form of Korean pop music. It was developed in the years before and during World War II around the early 1900s. Well-known interpreters of this genre are Lee Mi-ja, Bae Ho, Nam Jin, Na Hoon-a, Joo Hyun-mi. Rock musicians such as Cho Yong-pil also performed this type of music. In contemporary South Korea, it has enjoyed a revival at the hands of Jang Yoon Jeong, who recorded the popular trot songs &quot;Jjan-jja-ra&quot; () and &quot;Eo-meo-na&quot; ().

====Rock====
Rock music is said to have spread to Korea from the Eighth United States Army (EUSA) bases after the Korean War. Shin Jung-hyeon, frequently referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Korean Rock,&quot; got his start playing popular rock covers for American servicemen in the 1950s, particularly being noted for his take on Iron Butterfly&#x27;s In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Shin developed his style of psychedelic rock in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s and recorded albums with several bands, such as the Add 4, the Men, and the Yup Juns, and wrote songs and played on albums for well-known singers, such as Kim Chu Ja and Jang Hyun, and lesser known singers, like Kim Jung Mi. After refusing an order from then-president Park Chung Hee to write a song praising the president, Park banned Shin&#x27;s music and ultimately imprisoned him for marijuana possession. The imprisonment of Shin slowed the production of Korean rock, but other artists, most notably Sanulrim emerged during the late &#x27;70s, before dance music came to dominate Korean popular music in the &#x27;80s.

In the 1980s, popular musical tastes had moved away from rock music. The scene was dominated by heavy metal music, in particular Boohwal, Baekdoosan, and Sinawe, collectively known as the Big 3.

Rock music was revived in the early &#x27;90s with democratization following the presidency of Roh Tae-woo. As information flowed more freely into the country, Korean youths were exposed to decades of popular foreign music in a short period, and some began to form bands. Two of the earliest bands were Crying Nut and No Brain, which introduced the country to a variety of new genres in a localized blend called &quot;Chosun Punk,&quot; spearheaded by indie label Drug Records which also managed Club Drug. With increased globalization and access to the Internet, the music scene diversified and incorporated more styles of music. The late &#x27;90s saw increasing diversity in musical influences, as younger bands like Rux emerged and The Geeks introduced Korea to straight edge hardcore punk.

====Folk====
&quot;T&#x27;ong guitar&quot; is a form of Korean folk and folk rock music developed in the early 1960s and &#x27;70s. It was heavily influenced by American folk music, and artists in the genre were considered Korean versions of American folk singers, such as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.

Notable early Korean folk musicians include the American-educated Hahn Dae-soo, and Kim Min-ki. Hahn and Kim recorded socially and politically conscious folk songs, and both artists had their music censored and banned by the autocratic Park Chung Hee government, much as the psychedelic rock guitarist Shin Jung-hyeon had his songs censored and banned. Despite the government&#x27;s efforts to censor political music, though, popular folk songs increasingly came to be used as rallying cries for social change within Korea, leading to the term &quot;norae undong&quot; (), or literally, &quot;song movement,&quot; being coined to describe songs targeted at social change. As South Korea was transitioning to democracy in 1987, the late folk musician Kim Kwang-Seok was noted for being politically active, and his songs were popular at democratic rallies.

====Hip-hop====
In South Korea, hip hop expanded into a cultural phenomenon in Seoul, Busan and Daegu. The movement has been growing since the mid-90s, especially after the success of Seo Taiji and Boys&#x27; smash hit &quot;Nan Arayo&quot; (난 알아요, &quot;I Know&quot;) and has been gaining attention internationally, as Koreans have won various championships around the world since the early 2000s. In 2004, Rain released his &quot;It&#x27;s Raining&quot; album, making him one of the first international stars outside of South Korea. Aside from mainstream hip-hop, there is also an underground hip-hop scene that has developed throughout South Korea. Online webzines have contributed to spreading the culture into the Korean mainstream. Since the mid-2010s and the success of the Mnet hip-hop competition TV show &quot;Show Me The Money&quot;, the popularity of hip hop in Korea has skyrocketed, and the lines between mainstream and underground hip hop have become increasingly blurred.

&quot;K-hip-hop&quot; is now the most popular music genre among young Koreans and has garnered a growing international following as well.

==== Ballad ====

Influenced by Western melodies and the sentimental ballad, ballad-style songs were initially introduced into the mainstream market in the 1960s. The Korean ballad style of music rose into popularity in the 1980s to become a staple genre in modern Korean music. Its song style is meant to capture the feelings of love, unrequited love, or heartbreak. Many official soundtracks (OSTs) for popular Korean dramas contain slow, dramatic ballad songs that are played whenever important plot points occur. Balladeers are behind the main theme songs for many dramas such as &quot;Winter Sonata, &quot;, and &quot;My Girlfriend Is a Nine-Tailed Fox&quot;.

==== Hybridization ====
The music genre primarily changed from ballad to Western music styles, including rap, reggae, R&amp;B, and hip hop in the early twenty–first century. K-pop music has experienced the process of hybridization as it was influenced by the globalized Western music genres. The term hybridization refers to local cultures creating unique combinations incorporating foreign and globalized influences. Other than hybrid music genres of K-pop, English mixing in the lyrics of K-pop is another important change in contemporary K-pop music culture. According to Jin and Ryoo, K-pop has incorporated diverse stylistic input from abroad which has been related to the boom of hybrid K-pop through a Korean–English mix in lyrics. Instead of providing beautiful melodies, K-pop idols also try to maximize melody lines with easy English lyrics. Korean entertainment companies have developed the mixing language of English into lyrics because it is easier for foreigners to remember the song.

==Independent popular music==

Independent popular music, such as &quot;indie rock,&quot; or &quot;indie&quot; (), and independent hip hop, is growing in popularity in Korea, fueled by an increase in the number of independent acts, as well as an increase in the coverage of those independent acts by blogs. Notable popular indie groups from the 1990s and 2000s include Jaurim (), Huckleberry Finn (), Nell (), Mot (), Cherry Filter (), and Third Line Butterfly (3호선 버터플라이), as well as the more recent Busker Busker, among others.

==Classical music==

With the arrival of Western culture in South Korea, European classical music has been significantly popular in the Korean music scene. The genre has produced a number of preeminent classical musicians such as Yiruma. The fine range of Korean symphonic orchestras have been bolstered by notable performers and soloists, as well as highly skilled orchestra directors. Internationally known Korean composers of classical music include such notables as Yi Suin, who specializes in music for children, and is known for the famous &quot;Song of My Homeland&quot;.

Another of Korea&#x27;s internationally prominent composers is Young-ja Lee. She was born in 1931 in Wonju and studied at the Conservatoire de Paris and the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. She continued her education at the Manhattan School of Music. Lee endured hardships during the Japanese occupation and Korean War, but emerged to become one of the dominant forces in Korean music in the 20th century.

Hyo-Won Woo was born in 1974 and wrote mainly Christian choral music, for example Gloria, using elements of both traditional Korean music and contemporary classical music.

==Korean contemporary Christian music==

With the importation of Christianity, the evangelical use of music for proselytizing has led to many choirs, both within and without churches, and the importation of traditional American styles of Christian folksongs sung in Korean.

==Western and traditional crossover==
Korean traditional instruments have been integrated into western percussion, and are beginning a new wave of Korean world music since 1998. Traditional instruments are amplified, and sampled, with traditional songs rescored for new demographics and regions.

<doc id="313406" wikidata="Q4306573" url="?curid=313406" title="Music of North Korea">
<text>The music of North Korea includes a wide array of folk, popular, light instrumental, political, and classical performers. Beyond patriotic and political music, popular music groups like Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble and Moranbong Band perform songs about everyday life in the DPRK and modern light pop reinterpretations of classic Korean folk music. Music education is widely taught in schools, with President Kim Il Sung first implementing a program of study of musical instruments in 1949 at an orphanage in Mangyongdae. Musical diplomacy also continues to be relevant to the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, with musical and cultural delegations completing concerts in China and France in recent years, and musicians from Western countries and South Korea collaborate on projects in the DPRK.

==&quot;Taejung kayo&quot;==
After the division of Korea in 1945 and the establishment of North Korea in 1948, revolutionary song-writing traditions were channeled into support for the state, eventually becoming a style of patriotic song called &quot;taejung kayo&quot; () in the 1980s combining classical Western symphonic music, the Soviet socialist realism style, and Korean traditional musical forms. The songs are generally sung by female and male performers - either a choir, small groups or a soloist - with accompanying bands or choirs accompanied by a large orchestra (either Western style or a hybrid of western and traditional) or a concert band, and in recent years, a pop band or big band/jazz band with guitars, electric guitars, keyboards, strings, a drum kit and brass section with occasional accordions and traditional instrumentation.

North Korean music follows the principles of Juche (self-reliance) ideology. The characteristic march like, upbeat music of North Korea is carefully composed, rarely individually performed, and its lyrics and imagery have a clear optimistic content.

Much music is composed for movies, television dramas, and TV movies, and the works of the Korean composer Isang Yun (1917–1995), who spent much of his life in Germany, are popular in North Korea.

==Pop music==
Under Kim Il Sung&#x27;s era, only ideologically correct music was allowed. Jazz in particular was considered out of bounds. Many artists however found their way around these limitations by writing ideologically correct lyrics while taking liberties with the score. Under Kim Jong Il, previously forbidden genres, even jazz, became permissible and encouraged.

Many North Korean pop songs are usually performed by young female singers with an electric ensemble, percussionist, and accompanying singers and dancers. However, there are also male singers or a chorus in community or company pop bands. Some North Korean pop songs such as &quot;Whistle&quot;—set to the lyrics of North Korean poet Cho Ki-chon—have become popular in South Korea. Common lyrical themes include military might (&quot;We Shall Hold Bayonets More Firmly&quot;, &quot;Look At Us!&quot;, &quot;One Against a Hundred&quot;), economic production and thrift (&quot;The Joy of Bumper Harvest Overflows Amidst the Song of Mechanisation&quot;, &quot;Attain the Cutting Edge (The CNC Song)&quot;, &quot;I Also Raise Chickens&quot;, &quot;Potato Pride&quot;, &quot;Chollima on the Wing&quot;), patriotism (&quot;My Country Is the Best&quot;, &quot;We Have Nothing To Envy&quot;, &quot;Onwards Toward the Final Victory&quot;) and glorification of the party and leaders (&quot;Where Are You, Dear General?&quot;, &quot;No Motherland Without You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask My Name&quot;, &quot;The General Uses Warp&quot;, &quot;Footsteps&quot;). Songs like &quot;We Are One&quot; and &quot;Reunification Rainbow&quot; sing of the hopes for Korean reunification. There are also songs with more casual themes, such as &quot;Women Are Flowers&quot; and &quot;Ballad of Gold Mountains&quot;.

In 2012, North Korea&#x27;s first major girl band, the Moranbong Band, made its world debut. It is a group of about sixteen North Korean women (eleven instrumentalists and five singers) which was hand-selected by Kim Jong Un.

BBC radio disc jockey Andy Kershaw noted, on a visit to North Korea with Koryo Tours in 2003, that the only recordings available were by the pop singers Jon Hye-yong, Kim Kwang-suk, Jo Kum-hwa and Ri Pun-hui, and the groups Wangjaesan Light Music Band, the Mansudae Art Troupe and the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble, who play in a style Kershaw refers to as &quot;light instrumental with popular vocal&quot;. There is also the State Symphony Orchestra, the Sea of Blood Opera Company, two choruses, an orchestra and an ensemble dedicated to Isang Yun&#x27;s compositions, all in Pyongyang. The Pyongyang Film Studios also produces many instrumental songs for its films, and several programs on Korean Central Television have music made and performed by the Central Radio and Television Orchestra.

In 2010, a brutal death metal group purporting to be from North Korea, called Red War (붉은전쟁), released a three-track demo online. However, as of 2014 the group are believed to be disbanded. The metal music archive Spirit of Metal currently lists two bands that claim to originate from North Korea, Red War and the pornogrind band Teagirl.

North Korean pop music is available for visitors to Pyongyang at the Koryo Hotel or Number One Department Store, as well as gift shops in tourist destinations. International and Western music can be enjoyed by locals and tourists at the Grand People&#x27;s Study House, Pyongyang&#x27;s central library.

==Music of Enlightment==
A lot of songs composed during Korea under Japanese rule, which are known in South Korea today as Trot are called &quot;Enlightenment Period song&quot; (계몽기 가요). It is no longer composed as propaganda music has since displaced other musical forms. Those songs were only orally-recorded for a long time. However, it was intentionally revived during the Kim Jong Il administration: in the late 2000s, Korean Central Television aired a TV program that introduced those &quot;Enlightenment songs&quot;.

==Folk music==

Alongside contemporary pop songs, groups like Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble have recorded arrangements of Korean folk songs. The Korean folk song &quot;Arirang&quot; continues to be widely popular in the DPRK, with UNESCO inscribing the song to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2014, representing the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea.

Like Korean music in general, North Korean music includes kinds of both folk and classical, courtly music, including genres like sanjo, pansori, and nongak. Pansori is long vocal and percussive music played by one singer and one drummer. The lyrics tell one of five different stories, but is individualized by each performer, often with updated jokes and audience participation. Nongak is a rural form of percussion music, typically played by twenty to thirty performers. Sanjo is entirely instrumental that shifts rhythms and melodic modes during the song. Instruments include the changgo drum set against a melodic instrument, such as the gayageum or ajaeng.

==Instruments==

In North Korea, traditional instruments have been adapted in order to allow them to compete with Western instruments. Many older musical forms remain and are used in both traditional performances that have been attuned to the ideas and the way of life of the modern North Korean communist state and to accompany modern songs in praise of Kim Il Sung, his son and successor, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un from 2012 onward, plus songs that wish for a reunited Korea, thus creating a mix of traditional and Western music that is truly North Korean, a unique variant of Korean music as a whole mixing the old and the new.

The modern Ongnyugeum zithers and the Sohaegeum four stringed fiddle are North Korean modernized versions of traditional Korean musical instruments, both used in traditional and modern musical forms.

Military music, in contrast, often makes extensive use of Western brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments, often omitting the Korean ones entirely. Although usually original compositions, the melodies are not easily distinguishable from Western ones in the absence of their lyrics, which heavily feature the customary ideologically oriented content.

<text>Dancing Rabbit is a ecovillage near Rutledge, Missouri, United States, that was formed in 1997. It has a population of around 30 people who abide by ecological covenants and sustainability guidelines, but are otherwise responsible for their own finances, food, housing, and other necessities.

The ecovillage was featured in an episode of the FX television series &quot;30 Days&quot;, where two non-residents stayed in the village, lived in a converted grain bin, and helped with projects such as gardening, natural building and cooking for a month. The village was also featured in the 2012 documentary short &quot;The Rhythm of Rutledge&quot;. and an episode of &quot;My World, Too&quot;, which addressed sustainable practices and details of living in the ecovillage.

<text>A spectrum analyzer measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within the full frequency range of the instrument. The primary use is to measure the power of the spectrum of known and unknown signals. The input signal that most common spectrum analyzers measure is electrical; however, spectral compositions of other signals, such as acoustic pressure waves and optical light waves, can be considered through the use of an appropriate transducer. Spectrum analyzers for other types of signals also exist, such as optical spectrum analyzers which use direct optical techniques such as a monochromator to make measurements.

By analyzing the spectra of electrical signals, dominant frequency, power, distortion, harmonics, bandwidth, and other spectral components of a signal can be observed that are not easily detectable in time domain waveforms. These parameters are useful in the characterization of electronic devices, such as wireless transmitters.

The display of a spectrum analyzer has &quot;frequency&quot; displayed on the horizontal axis and the &quot;amplitude&quot; on the vertical axis. To the casual observer, a spectrum analyzer looks like an oscilloscope, which plots &quot;amplitude&quot; on the vertical axis but &quot;time&quot; on the horizontal axis. In fact, some lab instruments can function either as an oscilloscope or a spectrum analyzer.

== History ==
The first spectrum analyzers, in the 1960s, were swept-tuned instruments.

Following the discovery of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in 1965, the first FFT-based analyzers were introduced in 1967.

Today, there are three basic types of analyzer: the swept-tuned spectrum analyzer, the vector signal analyzer, and the real-time spectrum analyzer.

== Types ==

Spectrum analyzer types are distinguished by the methods used to obtain the spectrum of a signal. There are swept-tuned and fast Fourier transform (FFT) based spectrum analyzers:

*A &quot;swept-tuned&quot; analyzer uses a superheterodyne receiver to down-convert a portion of the input signal spectrum to the center frequency of a narrow band-pass filter, whose instantaneous output power is recorded or displayed as a function of time. By sweeping the receiver&#x27;s center-frequency (using a voltage-controlled oscillator) through a range of frequencies, the output is also a function of frequency. But while the sweep centers on any particular frequency, it may be missing short-duration events at other frequencies.
*An FFT analyzer computes a time-sequence of periodograms. &quot;FFT&quot; refers to a particular mathematical algorithm used in the process. This is commonly used in conjunction with a receiver and analog-to-digital converter. As above, the receiver reduces the center-frequency of a portion of the input signal spectrum, but the portion is not swept. The purpose of the receiver is to reduce the sampling rate that the analyzer must contend with. With a sufficiently low sample-rate, FFT analyzers can process all the samples (100% duty-cycle), and are therefore able to avoid missing short-duration events.

== Form factor ==
Spectrum analyzers tend to fall into four form factors: benchtop, portable, handheld and networked.

===Benchtop===
This form factor is useful for applications where the spectrum analyzer can be plugged into AC power, which generally means in a lab environment or production/manufacturing area. Bench top spectrum analyzers have historically offered better performance and specifications than the portable or handheld form factor. Bench top spectrum analyzers normally have multiple fans (with associated vents) to dissipate heat produced by the processor. Due to their architecture, bench top spectrum analyzers typically weigh more than . Some bench top spectrum analyzers offer optional battery packs, allowing them to be used away from AC power. This type of analyzer is often referred to as a &quot;portable&quot; spectrum analyzer.

=== Portable ===
This form factor is useful for any applications where the spectrum analyzer needs to be taken outside to make measurements or simply carried while in use. Attributes that contribute to a useful portable spectrum analyzer include:
*Optional battery-powered operation to allow the user to move freely outside.
*Clearly viewable display to allow the screen to be read in bright sunlight, darkness or dusty conditions.
*Light weight (usually less than ).

=== Handheld ===

This form factor is useful for any application where the spectrum analyzer needs to be very light and small. Handheld analyzers usually offer a limited capability relative to larger systems. Attributes that contribute to a useful handheld spectrum analyzer include:
*Very low power consumption.
*Battery-powered operation while in the field to allow the user to move freely outside.
*Very small size
*Light weight (usually less than ).

=== Networked ===
This form factor does not include a display and these devices are designed to enable a new class of geographically-distributed spectrum monitoring and analysis applications. The key attribute is the ability to connect the analyzer to a network and monitor such devices across a network. While many spectrum analyzers have an Ethernet port for control, they typically lack efficient data transfer mechanisms and are too bulky or expensive to be deployed in such a distributed manner. Key applications for such devices include RF intrusion detection systems for secure facilities where wireless signaling is prohibited. As well cellular operators are using such analyzers to remotely monitor interference in licensed spectral bands. The distributed nature of such devices enable geo-location of transmitters, spectrum monitoring for dynamic spectrum access and many other such applications.

Key attributes of such devices include:
* Network-efficient data transfer
* Low power consumption
* The ability to synchronize data captures across a network of analyzers
* Low cost to enable mass deployment.

== Theory of operation ==

=== Swept-tuned ===
As discussed above in types, a swept-tuned spectrum analyzer down-converts a portion of the input signal spectrum to the center frequency of a band-pass filter by sweeping the voltage-controlled oscillator through a range of frequencies, enabling the consideration of the full frequency range of the instrument.

The bandwidth of the band-pass filter dictates the resolution bandwidth, which is related to the minimum bandwidth detectable by the instrument. As demonstrated by the animation to the right, the smaller the bandwidth, the more spectral resolution. However, there is a trade-off between how quickly the display can update the full frequency span under consideration and the frequency resolution, which is relevant for distinguishing frequency components that are close together. For a swept-tuned architecture, this relation for sweep time is useful:

: formula_1

Where ST is sweep time in seconds, k is proportionality constant, Span is the frequency range under consideration in hertz, and RBW is the resolution bandwidth in Hertz.
Sweeping too fast, however, causes a drop in displayed amplitude and a shift in the displayed frequency.

Also, the animation contains both up- and down-converted spectra, which is due to a frequency mixer producing both sum and difference frequencies. The local oscillator feedthrough is due to the imperfect isolation from the IF signal path in the mixer.

For very weak signals, a pre-amplifier is used, although harmonic and intermodulation distortion may lead to the creation of new frequency components that were not present in the original signal.

=== FFT-based ===
With an FFT based spectrum analyzer, the frequency resolution is formula_2, the inverse of the time &quot;T&quot; over which the waveform is measured and Fourier transformed.

With Fourier transform analysis in a digital spectrum analyzer, it is necessary to sample the input signal with a sampling frequency formula_3 that is at least twice the bandwidth of the signal, due to the Nyquist limit. A Fourier transform will then produce a spectrum containing all frequencies from zero to formula_4. This can place considerable demands on the required analog-to-digital converter and processing power for the Fourier transform, making FFT based spectrum analyzers limited in frequency range.

=== Hybrid superheterodyne-FFT ===
Since FFT based analyzers are only capable of considering narrow bands, one technique is to combine swept and FFT analysis for consideration of wide and narrow spans. This technique allows for faster sweep time.

This method is made possible by first down converting the signal, then digitizing the intermediate frequency and using superheterodyne or FFT techniques to acquire the spectrum.

One benefit of digitizing the intermediate frequency is the ability to use digital filters, which have a range of advantages over analog filters such as near perfect shape factors and improved filter settling time. Also, for consideration of narrow spans, the FFT can be used to increase sweep time without distorting the displayed spectrum.

=== Realtime FFT ===
A realtime spectrum analyser does not have any blind time—up to some maximum span, often called the &quot;realtime bandwidth&quot;. The analyser is able to sample the incoming RF spectrum in the time domain and convert the information to the frequency domain using the FFT process. FFT&#x27;s are processed in parallel, gapless and overlapped so there are no gaps in the calculated RF spectrum and no information is missed.

==== Online realtime and offline realtime ====
In a sense, any spectrum analyzer that has vector signal analyzer capability is a realtime analyzer. It samples data fast enough to satisfy Nyquist Sampling theorem and stores the data in memory for later processing. This kind of analyser is only realtime for the amount of data / capture time it can store in memory and still produces gaps in the spectrum and results during processing time.

==== FFT overlapping ====
Minimizing distortion of information is important in all spectrum analyzers. The FFT process applies windowing techniques to improve the output spectrum due to producing less side lobes. The effect of windowing may also reduce the level of a signal where it is captured on the boundary between one FFT and the next. For this reason FFT&#x27;s in a Realtime spectrum analyzer are overlapped. Overlapping rate is approximately 80%. An analyzer that utilises a 1024-point FFT process will re-use approximately 819 samples from the previous FFT process.

==== Minimum signal detection time ====
This is related to the sampling rate of the analyser and the FFT rate. It is also important for the realtime spectrum analyzer to give good level accuracy.

Example: for an analyser with of realtime bandwidth (the maximum RF span that can be processed in realtime) approximately (complex) are needed. If the spectrum analyzer produces an FFT calculation is produced every For a FFT a full spectrum is produced approximately every This also gives us our overlap rate of 80% (20 μs − 4 μs) / 20 μs = 80%.

===== Persistence =====
Realtime spectrum analyzers are able to produce much more information for users to examine the frequency spectrum in more detail. A normal swept spectrum analyzer would produce max peak, min peak displays for example but a realtime spectrum analyzer is able to plot all calculated FFT&#x27;s over a given period of time with the added colour-coding which represents how often a signal appears. For example, this image shows the difference between how a spectrum is displayed in a normal swept spectrum view and using a &quot;Persistence&quot; view on a realtime spectrum analyzer.

===== Hidden signals =====
Realtime spectrum analyzers are able to see signals hidden behind other signals. This is possible because no information is missed and the display to the user is the output of FFT calculations. An example of this can be seen on the right.

== Typical functionality ==

=== Center frequency and span ===
In a typical spectrum analyzer there are options to set the start, stop, and center frequency. The frequency halfway between the stop and start frequencies on a spectrum analyzer display is known as the center frequency. This is the frequency that is in the middle of the display&#x27;s frequency axis. Span specifies the range between the start and stop frequencies. These two parameters allow for adjustment of the display within the frequency range of the instrument to enhance visibility of the spectrum measured.

=== Resolution bandwidth ===
As discussed in the operation section, the resolution bandwidth filter or RBW filter is the bandpass filter in the IF path. It&#x27;s the bandwidth of the RF chain before the detector (power measurement device). It determines the RF noise floor and how close two signals can be and still be resolved by the analyzer into two separate peaks. Adjusting the bandwidth of this filter allows for the discrimination of signals with closely spaced frequency components, while also changing the measured noise floor. Decreasing the bandwidth of an RBW filter decreases the measured noise floor and vice versa. This is due to higher RBW filters passing more frequency components through to the envelope detector than lower bandwidth RBW filters, therefore a higher RBW causes a higher measured noise floor.

=== Video bandwidth ===
The video bandwidth filter or VBW filter is the low-pass filter directly after the envelope detector. It&#x27;s the bandwidth of the signal chain after the detector. Averaging or peak detection then refers to how the digital storage portion of the device records samples—it takes several samples per time step and stores only one sample, either the average of the samples or the highest one. The video bandwidth determines the capability to discriminate between two different power levels. This is because a narrower VBW will remove noise in the detector output. This filter is used to &quot;smooth&quot; the display by removing noise from the envelope. Similar to the RBW, the VBW affects the sweep time of the display if the VBW is less than the RBW. If VBW is less than RBW, this relation for sweep time is useful:

:formula_5

Here &quot;t&quot;sweep is the sweep time, &quot;k&quot; is a dimensionless proportionality constant, &quot;f&quot;2 − &quot;f&quot;1 is the frequency range of the sweep, RBW is the resolution bandwidth, and VBW is the video bandwidth.

=== Detector ===
With the advent of digitally based displays, some modern spectrum analyzers use analog-to-digital converters to sample spectrum amplitude after the VBW filter. Since displays have a discrete number of points, the frequency span measured is also digitised. Detectors are used in an attempt to adequately map the correct signal power to the appropriate frequency point on the display. There are in general three types of detectors: sample, peak, and average
*Sample detection – sample detection simply uses the midpoint of a given interval as the display point value. While this method does represent random noise well, it does not always capture all sinusoidal signals.
*Peak detection – peak detection uses the maximum measured point within a given interval as the display point value. This insures that the maximum sinusoid is measured within the interval; however, smaller sinusoids within the interval may not be measured. Also, peak detection does not give a good representation of random noise.
*Average detection – average detection uses all of the data points within the interval to consider the display point value. This is done by power (rms) averaging, voltage averaging, or log-power averaging.

=== Displayed average noise level ===
The Displayed Average Noise Level (DANL) is just what it says it is—the average noise level displayed on the analyzer. This can either be with a specific resolution bandwidth (e.g. −120 dBm @1 kHz RBW), or normalized to 1 Hz (usually in dBm/Hz) e.g. −150 dBm(Hz).This is also called the sensitivity of the spectrum analyzer. If a signal level equal to the average noise level is fed there will be a 3 dB display. To increase the sensitivity of the spectrum analyzer a preamplifier with lower noise figure may be connected at the input of the spectrum analyzer.

== Radio-frequency uses ==

Spectrum analyzers are widely used to measure the frequency response, noise and distortion characteristics of all kinds of radio-frequency (RF) circuitry, by comparing the input and output spectra. For example, in RF mixers, spectrum analyzer is used to find the levels of third order inter-modulation products and conversion loss. In RF oscillators, spectrum analyzer is used to find the levels of different harmonics.

In telecommunications, spectrum analyzers are used to determine occupied bandwidth and track interference sources. For example, cell planners use this equipment to determine interference sources in the GSM frequency bands and UMTS frequency bands.

In EMC testing, a spectrum analyzer is used for basic precompliance testing; however, it can not be used for full testing and certification. Instead, an EMI receiver is used.

A spectrum analyzer is used to determine whether a wireless transmitter is working according to defined standards for purity of emissions. Output signals at frequencies other than the intended communications frequency appear as vertical lines (pips) on the display. A spectrum analyzer is also used to determine, by direct observation, the bandwidth of a digital or analog signal.

A spectrum analyzer interface is a device that connects to a wireless receiver or a personal computer to allow visual detection and analysis of electromagnetic signals over a defined band of frequencies. This is called panoramic reception and it is used to determine the frequencies of sources of interference to wireless networking equipment, such as Wi-Fi and wireless routers.

Spectrum analyzers can also be used to assess RF shielding. RF shielding is of particular importance for the siting of a magnetic resonance imaging machine since stray RF fields would result in artifacts in an MR image.

== Audio-frequency uses ==
Spectrum analysis can be used at audio frequencies to analyse the harmonics of an audio signal. A typical application is to measure the distortion of a nominally sinewave signal; a very-low-distortion sinewave is used as the input to equipment under test, and a spectrum analyser can examine the output, which will have added distortion products, and determine the percentage distortion at each harmonic of the fundamental. Such analysers were at one time described as &quot;wave analysers&quot;. Analysis can be carried out by a general-purpose digital computer with a sound card selected for suitable performance and appropriate software. Instead of using a low-distortion sinewave, the input can be subtracted from the output, attenuated and phase-corrected, to give only the added distortion and noise, which can be analysed.

An alternative technique, total harmonic distortion measurement, cancels out the fundamental with a notch filter and measures the total remaining signal, which is total harmonic distortion plus noise; it does not give the harmonic-by-harmonic detail of an analyser.

Spectrum analyzers are also used by audio engineers to assess their work. In these applications, the spectrum analyzer will show volume levels of frequency bands across the typical range of human hearing, rather than displaying a wave. In live sound applications, engineers can use them to pinpoint feedback.

== Optical spectrum analyzer ==

An optical spectrum analyzer uses reflective or refractive techniques to separate out the wavelengths of light. An electro-optical detector is used to measure the intensity of the light, which is then normally displayed on a screen in a similar manner to a radio- or audio-frequency spectrum analyzer.

The input to an optical spectrum analyzer may be simply via an aperture in the instrument&#x27;s case, an optical fiber or an optical connector to which a fiber-optic cable can be attached.

Different techniques exist for separating out the wavelengths. One method is to use a monochromator, for example a Czerny–Turner design, with an optical detector placed at the output slit. As the grating in the monochromator moves, bands of different frequencies (colors) are &#x27;seen&#x27; by the detector, and the resulting signal can then be plotted on a display. More precise measurements (down to MHz in the optical spectrum) can be made with a scanning Fabry–Pérot interferometer along with analog or digital control electronics, which sweep the resonant frequency of an optically resonant cavity using a voltage ramp to piezoelectric motor that varies the distance between two highly reflective mirrors. A sensitive photodiode embedded in the cavity provides an intensity signal, which is plotted against the ramp voltage to produce a visual representation of the optical power spectrum.

The frequency response of optical spectrum analyzers tends to be relatively limited, e.g. (near-infrared), depending on the intended purpose, although (somewhat) wider-bandwidth general purpose instruments are available.

== Vibration spectrum analyzer ==
A vibration spectrum analyzer allows to analyze vibration amplitudes at various component frequencies, In this way, vibration occurring at specific frequencies can be identified and tracked. Since particular machinery problems generate vibration at specific frequencies, machinery faults can be detected or diagnosed. Vibration Spectrum Analyzers use the signal from different types of sensor, such as: accelerometers, velocity transducers and proximity sensors. The uses of a vibration spectrum analyzer in machine condition monitoring allows to detect and identify machine faults such as: rotor imbalance, shaft misalignment, mechanical looseness, bearing defects, among others. Vibration analysis can also be used in structures to identify structural resonances or to perform modal analysis.

<doc id="313418" wikidata="Q104831" url="?curid=313418" title="Luminous intensity">
<text>In photometry, luminous intensity is a measure of the wavelength-weighted power emitted by a light source in a particular direction per unit solid angle, based on the luminosity function, a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye. The SI unit of luminous intensity is the candela (cd), an SI base unit.

==Measurement==
Photometry deals with the measurement of visible light as perceived by human eyes. The human eye can only see light in the visible spectrum and has different sensitivities to light of different wavelengths within the spectrum. When adapted for bright conditions (photopic vision), the eye is most sensitive to yellow-green light at 555 nm. Light with the same radiant intensity at other wavelengths has a lower luminous intensity. The curve which represents the response of the human eye to light is a defined standard function or established by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE, for &quot;Commission Internationale de l&#x27;Éclairage&quot;) and standardized in collaboration with the ISO. 

Luminous intensity of artificial light sources is typically measured using and a goniophotometer outfitted with a photometer or a spectroradiometer. 
==Relationship to other measures==

Luminous intensity should not be confused with another photometric unit, luminous flux, which is the total perceived power emitted in all directions. Luminous intensity is the perceived power &quot;per unit solid angle&quot;. If a lamp has a 1 lumen bulb and the optics of the lamp are set up to focus the light evenly into a 1 steradian beam, then the beam would have a luminous intensity of 1 candela. If the optics were changed to concentrate the beam into 1/2 steradian then the source would have a luminous intensity of 2 candela. The resulting beam is narrower and brighter, though its luminous flux remains unchanged.

Luminous intensity is also not the same as the radiant intensity, the corresponding objective physical quantity used in the measurement science of radiometry.

==Units==
Like other SI base units, the candela has an operational definition—it is defined by the description of a physical process that will produce one candela of luminous intensity. By definition, if one constructs a light source that emits monochromatic green light with a frequency of 540 THz, and that has a radiant intensity of 1/683 watts per steradian in a given direction, that light source will emit one candela in the specified direction.

The frequency of light used in the definition corresponds to a wavelength in a vacuum of , which is near the peak of the eye&#x27;s response to light. If the source emitted uniformly in all directions, the total radiant flux would be about , since there are 4 steradians in a sphere. A typical modern candle produces very roughly one candela while releasing heat at roughly .

Prior to the definition of the candela, a variety of units for luminous intensity were used in various countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a &quot;standard candle&quot; of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these standards was the English standard: candlepower. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120 grains per hour. Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia used the Hefnerkerze, a unit based on the output of a Hefner lamp. In 1881, Jules Violle proposed the &quot;Violle&quot; as a unit of luminous intensity, and it was notable as the first unit of light intensity that did not depend on the properties of a particular lamp. All of these units were superseded by the definition of the candela.

==Usage==

The luminous intensity for monochromatic light of a particular wavelength is given by
formula_1
where
* is the luminous intensity in candelas (cd),
* is the radiant intensity in watts per steradian (W/sr),
* formula_2 is the standard luminosity function.

If more than one wavelength is present (as is usually the case), one must sum or integrate over the spectrum of wavelengths present to get the luminous intensity:

formula_3

<doc id="313434" wikidata="Q5314251" url="?curid=313434" title="Duncan Cameron (British Army officer)">
<text>General Sir Duncan Alexander Cameron, (20 May 18088 June 1888) was a British Army officer who fought in the Crimean War and part of the New Zealand Wars. He was later a governor of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

Born into a family with a military tradition, Cameron joined the British Army in 1825. Commissioned into the 42nd Regiment of Foot, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel by 1854 and was a battalion commander. He served in the Crimean War and fought in the Battle of Alma. Afterwards, he assumed command of the Highland Brigade and led it through the Battle of Balaclava and the Siege of Sevastopol. He finished the war as a temporary major-general and received several honours for his service. He then held a series of educational and advisory posts with the British Army before becoming Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1860.

The following year, Cameron was appointed commander of British forces in New Zealand, which was dealing with the ongoing New Zealand Wars. At the time, the Colonial Government was engaged in a conflict with the Māori in the Taranaki region. However, by the time Cameron arrived in the Taranaki, a truce had been arranged. Two years later, he suppressed a further outbreak of fighting in the area and then led the invasion of the Waikato to deal with the King Movement, a Māori resistance that threatened British sovereignty in the country. He commanded a series of mostly successful engagements with the Kingites, followers of the King Movement, but none were decisive. By March 1864, he had advanced in the Waikato heartland and had pushed the Kingites into the King Country. At Gate Pā in April 1864, his forces suffered a major defeat. By this stage, Cameron was becoming disillusioned with the conduct of the war. Against his wishes, in early 1865 he commanded a campaign against Māori in the southern Taranaki. Coming under political pressure to wage a war he felt was inappropriate, he tendered his resignation and left New Zealand in August 1865.

In 1868, Cameron was made a lieutenant-general and was appointed as governor of the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He remained in this post until 1875, at which time he retired from military service with the rank of general and as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. He died in 1888 at the age of 80.

==Early life==
Born on 20 May 1808, Duncan Cameron was a son of Sir John Cameron and Lady Cameron. His mother was from Guernsey and was the niece of Admiral James Saumarez. His father, who retired with the rank of lieutenant-general, was an officer in the British Army who was serving in the Peninsular War and was Scottish. A younger brother, John Cameron, went on to become a lieutenant-general in the British Army, serving in the Royal Engineers. Duncan Cameron most likely was educated at Eton College, as was his father before him.

==Military career==
Cameron followed his father into the British Army, joining the 42nd Regiment of Foot in April 1825. He was promoted lieutenant the following year, to captain in 1833, to major in 1839, and lieutenant-colonel in 1843, at which time he was commanding a battalion of the regiment on Malta.

On the entry of the United Kingdom into the Crimean War in 1854, the 42nd Regiment was transferred to Turkey as part of the Highland Brigade, 1st Division, with Cameron still a battalion commander. He was soon promoted to colonel and commanded his battalion during the Battle of Alma in September 1854. Shortly afterwards he was appointed commander of the Highland Brigade, and led it through the subsequent Battle of Balaclava and the Siege of Sevastopol. Receiving a promotion to temporary major-general in November 1855, he was the recipient of several awards as a result of his service in the Crimea; appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, he was also made an Officer of the Legion of Honour, and received the Order of the Medjidie, Third Class, in 1858.

After the war in Crimea, Cameron became involved in education of British Army personnel. He was appointed to the Council for Army Education in 1857 as its vice president and carried out reforms of both the Royal Military College and the Staff College at Sandhurst. In 1859, he served on the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, whose recommendations prompted a huge programme of fortification for British naval dockyards. The same year his rank of major-general was made substantive. In 1860, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Scotland, a position which saw him in command of all British forces in Scotland. By this stage of his career, Cameron was well regarded by his contemporaries.

==New Zealand==
In January 1861, Cameron was appointed commander of British forces in New Zealand, which at the time was engaged in the First Taranaki War. The war had broken out the previous year over disputed land sales between local Māori and settlers in the Taranaki region. Cameron&#x27;s appointment was at the behest of the War Office which was dissatisfied with the performance of the incumbent, Major-General Thomas Pratt, whose conduct of the fighting in the Taranaki had been the subject of much criticism. Receiving a temporary promotion to lieutenant-general, Cameron arrived in New Zealand in March 1861 and proceeded to the town of New Plymouth where he informed Pratt that he was being replaced. Although Cameron was keen to deal with the Māori threat in Taranaki, the Governor of New Zealand, Sir Thomas Gore Browne, had negotiated a truce to end the war.

North Island Māori were now becoming increasingly reluctant to sell land and the rise of the King Movement in the Waikato was considered to be a challenge to British sovereignty and the Colonial Government. Kingites, followers of the King Movement, had even supported the Taranaki Māori during the war. Browne, supported by Cameron, began preparing for an invasion of the Waikato. Cameron believed that 2,500 infantry would be sufficient, with a further 1,000 men to secure lines of communication. However, in May 1861, Browne&#x27;s current term as governor ended and rather than extending it, the Colonial Office in London replaced him with Sir George Grey. 

Grey put an immediate halt to the planned invasion, considering the existing resources inadequate. This was a major disappointment to Cameron who was eager to exercise his command and he soon submitted his resignation. It was declined and Grey encouraged Cameron to stay in his post with the prospect of leading an invasion at a later date. In the meantime, Cameron directed the main efforts of British forces in the continued construction of what is now known as the Great South Road from Drury, south of Auckland, to the Mangatāwhiri Stream, a tributary of the Waikato River that defined the northern Kingite border. This work had commenced during the early stages of preparing for the proposed invasion of Waikato.

===War in Taranaki===
After the cessation of hostilities in Taranaki, there was an ongoing dispute over a block of land at Waitara but by April 1863, Grey was preparing to return it to Taranaki Māori. Not knowing of Grey&#x27;s plans, the following month local Māori ambushed British troops at nearby Ōakura, killing nine soldiers. In retaliation, on 4 June 1863, Cameron led a force of 870 troops on a successful assault on a party of about 50 Māori still occupying the contested Tataraimaka block beside the Katikara River, killing 24.

This fresh outbreak of fighting in Taranaki, known as the Second Taranaki War, gave Grey leverage with the Colonial Office as he used it as justification for a request for an increase in the number of British soldiers in the country. In the meantime, he proceeded with the return of Waitara to the Māori, calming tensions in the Taranaki. Cameron and his forces quickly returned to Auckland where, despite his attack on the Tataraimaka block being a minor action, it was portrayed as a major success. Grey now decided to proceed with an invasion of the Waikato to eliminate the Kingite threat.

===Invasion of the Waikato===
Cameron, as a result of his experience in the Crimea, was conscious of the importance of sound logistics to support a military campaign. His preparations for the invasion included the organisation of a transport corps and a telegraph line. Steamers were purchased to form a flotilla that would allow Cameron&#x27;s forces to be supplied via the Waikato River. On 10 July 1863, he established his headquarters at Queen&#x27;s Redoubt, near what is now Pōkeno. The invasion began on 12 July 1863 when the British forces, numbering 380 men, crossed the Mangatāwhiri Stream and established a redoubt on the opposite bank. Five days later, Cameron, leading a party of 550 men, attacked Māori warriors entrenching at Koheroa, further south of the Mangatāwhiri Stream. The advancing British soldiers faltered in the face of gunfire from the Māori and Cameron had to personally rally and urge his men forward. The Māori, which the British claimed numbered about 300 but in fact were around 150 men, retreated and escaped, leaving 15 dead. Hailed as a great victory, the British falsely claimed 150 Māori had been killed in the attack for the loss of 12 British soldiers killed or wounded. Cameron was recommended for the Victoria Cross for his role in the attack although it was declined.

However, on the same day as the assault carried out at Koheroa, a Māori party attacked a British convoy moving along the Great South Road, killing several men and capturing a number of carts carrying supplies. Further raids and ambushes were carried out by Kingites behind the British lines for the next several weeks and Cameron, concerned about the threat posed to his supply lines, decided it was not possible to continue his advance into the Waikato. Instead, he had to divert much of his forces into the establishment of a series of outposts along his lines of communication. He did attempt an attack on a camp used by the raiding parties but his approach was detected and he and his men had to withdraw. It was not until late October that Cameron could resume his advance. His initial invasion army of around 4,000 men, had more than doubled with reinforcements from overseas. Even though nearly 6,000 men were still occupied in defending his lines of communication, Cameron was able to mobilise an attack force of nearly 2,000 against his next objective, Meremere. He had also received barges, and the armoured gunboats HMS &quot;Avon&quot; and &quot;Pioneer&quot;, and this facilitated movement of his force along the Waikato River.

At Meremere, the Kingites occupied a &quot;pā&quot; (hillfort) surrounded on three sides by swamp, while the fourth side overlooked the Waikato River and thus it was a barricade to further advance south. Using his river flotilla, on 31 October 1863, Cameron landed 600 troops to the rear of Meremere, with orders to entrench themselves. The flotilla returned to Cameron&#x27;s advanced base camp for a further 600 men to reinforce those already entrenching. He intended to land to the front of Meremere with the remainder of his force. However, the Kingites, numbering between 1,100 and 1,500 Māori, detected the arrival of the British and simply abandoned the &quot;pā&quot; at Meremere the next day and slipped away through the swamp. The British were able to simply walk in and seize the &quot;pā&quot;. Officially, the capture of Meremere was a success but in fact, Cameron saw it as a poor reward for the enforced delay it had caused his advance into the Waikato. 

The Kingites had established a &quot;pā&quot; at Rangiriri, overlooking the Waikato River and upstream from Meremere. The defensive position included not only the &quot;pā&quot; forming the central redoubt, but also trenches and ramparts extending to the river and to nearby Lake Waikare. About 500 Māori were present at Rangiriri although this was insufficient for a proper defence. However, the &quot;pā&quot; was well engineered, a fact conceded by Cameron after the resulting Battle of Rangiriri. On the afternoon of 20 November, Cameron attacked the front of the Māori position with a force of 900 men on 20 November while 320 men of the 40th Regiment of Foot, supplemented by 200 British Navy personnel, landed to the rear to prevent any retreat. The attack was preceded with an artillery bombardment from the cannon of the gunboats and three 6-pound Armstrong guns and while the defences on the riverside of the central &quot;pā&quot; was captured, the central redoubt and ramparts to the east, extending to Lake Waikare, were still held by the Māori. Cameron ordered further assaults later in the day but these were all beaten off and the British had to dig in for the evening. During the night, King Tāwhiao, the leader of the King Movement, Wiremu Tamihana and the mortally wounded chief Pene Te Wharepu, along with 200 warriors, were able to escape to the east. At dawn the next day, the remainder of the garrison surrendered to become prisoners. It was later claimed that the white flag hoisted to mark the surrender of the garrison was in fact intended to simply open negotiations but the British soldiers moved into the &quot;pā&quot; and demanded the weapons of the Māori. Although a victory for Cameron, who was later made a Knight of the Order of the Bath for his success, his forces had incurred losses of 130 men killed or wounded while the Māori suffered around 35 killed with 180 others made prisoner. Some colonists saw this as a poor reward for Rangiriri.

Cameron now led his force further into the Waikato heartland, seizing Ngāruawāhia, the small town at the confluence of the Waikato and Waipā Rivers that was the capital of King Tawhaio, on 8 December and raising the British flag there. The taking of the town was unchallenged; it had been abandoned while tentative terms for an end to the war were offered to, and subsequently rejected by, Grey. Cameron proceeded down the Waipā River, aiming for the valuable farming land around Te Awamutu. By late January 1864, he sighted Māori fortifications at Paterangi; these included four &quot;pā&quot;. Realising that these would be difficult to seize without significant risk to his force, he decided to bypass the fortifications and draw out its garrison into more favourable terrain for the British. He mounted a nighttime march with 1,200 soldiers on 20 February, getting past the Paterangi defences undetected and moving into a largely unoccupied Te Awamutu at 7:00 am the next day.

Beyond the town, away, was the settlement of Rangiaowhia. Cameron opted to advance against this settlement as well. It was lightly defended, with many women and children present, and 24 Māori were killed or wounded and another 33 taken prisoner. However, the commander of the Colonial Defence Forces, Colonel Marmaduke Nixon, was shot and later died of his wounds. The British then withdrew to Te Awamutu. On 22 February, the Māori garrison at Paterangi moved out with at least 700 heading for Rangiaowhia. Reaching an old &quot;pā&quot; site at Hairini, on the road to Rangiaowhia, the Māori began entrenching themselves here. Supported with two 6-pound Armstrong guns, Cameron decided to attack before they could complete their defences. His attack was a success, with at least 30, possibly even up to 70 or 80, killed out of around 400, for the loss of just two British soldiers. Paterangi was occupied by the British to deny it to the Māori. Cameron was later criticised for the Rangiaowhia attack; it was not a fighting &quot;pā&quot; and the Kingites considered the action contrary to established conduct of warfare. There were also accusations that one or more &quot;whare&quot; to which some had fled during the Rangiaowhia attack had been set on fire with them inside and that one man attempting to surrender was shot. The following day, Cameron led his troops in the sacking of the nearby village of Kihikihi, the home of Rewi Maniapoto, a prominent Māori chief in the King Movement. Like Rangiaowhia, Kihikihi was productive farmland for the Kingites and its loss to the Māori was significant.

In early March, Cameron went to Auckland to consult with Grey and the government for the next steps in the campaign and it was decided to continue with the strategy of depriving the Kingites of supplies. To this end, Cameron, moved most of his army towards Maungatautari leaving a garrison for redoubts being built at Kihikihi, Rangiaowhia, and Te Awamutu, where a strike force of 900 men under Colonel Robert Carey was also based. In the meantime, Maniapoto started construction of a &quot;pā&quot; at Ōrākau, which was from Kihikihi.

The &quot;pā&quot;, with its garrison of around 300 Māori, including around 250 warriors, had yet to be completed when British forces attacked on 31 March, having detected its presence the previous day. The initial assaults mounted by Carey&#x27;s strike force were repelled but were able to surround the &quot;pā&quot;. This prevented Māori reinforcements, newly arrived from Maungatautari, from entering the &quot;pā&quot;. Carey, realising an opportunity to inflict a serious blow to the Kingites was possible, requested reinforcements from Cameron, who dispatched 370 soldiers to Ōrākau, now under bombardment while a sap was dug by engineers in order to breach the &quot;pā&quot; defences. Cameron arrived at the battle site in the morning of 2 April with more reinforcements. Carey was preparing for a further frontal assault but Cameron put a halt to this and issued terms to the defenders of the &quot;pā&quot;. This was declined despite an invitation from Cameron, impressed with the resiliency of the defenders, to send out the 50-odd women and children present. By now the defenders lacked food, water and ammunition and that afternoon proceeded with a breakout from the southeast corner of the &quot;pā&quot;. The British lines at this point were thinly held by the 40th Regiment, and the majority of the Māori were able to escape into the surrounding swamp. They were hotly pursued by the British soldiers as well as local militia and numerous Māori were killed, wounded or taken prisoner. In total, around 80 to 150 Māori were killed at Ōrākau for the loss of only 16 British soldiers with a further 53 wounded. However, while most media of the time reported the Battle of Ōrākau as a victory for the British, as did the Kingites, Cameron saw it as a missed opportunity to inflict a decisive victory in the Waikato.

Cameron now returned to Maungatautari, where the Māori had established a defence line of several &quot;pā&quot;. He moved his forces up to face the Te Tiki o te Ihingarangi &quot;pā&quot;. It was strongly built and defended; Cameron understood this and chose to simply wait out the defenders rather than engage in a frontal attack. Having exhausted their supplies, it was abandoned by the Māori within a few days, on 5 April. Cameron had intended to move to winter quarters following his move against Maungatautari due to the expected difficulty in maintaining supply lines over the winter months. Accordingly, he withdrew his main force back to Auckland, leaving garrisons in place to secure the key gains of the campaign. The Kingites were now south of the Puniu River, which became a boundary between what became known as the King Country and the territory captured by the British. It would transpire that there would be no further fighting in the Waikato.

===Tauranga Campaign===
A local tribe, Ngai-te-Rangi, had begun construction of Gate Pā, close to Camp Te Papa, set up by the British at Tauranga. The camp was established earlier in the year as a means of preventing reinforcements travelling from the East Cape to join up with Waikato Māori and had already been subject to raids by the tribe. The camp commandant requested reinforcements so that an attack could be mounted. Cameron, now back in Auckland with the bulk of his army, realised that with Te Papa being close to a harbour, he was readily able to transport enough manpower and artillery to allow a sufficient concentration for a decisive battle. Seizing his opportunity, he arrived at Te Papa on 21 April 1864 and his attack force followed a few days later.

On 27 April, Cameron mounted a reconnaissance of Gate Pā and determined that it was formed of two redoubts, garrisoned by about 235 warriors. He moved up his attacking force of about 1,700 men, plus a large artillery train which started bombarding the walls of the Māori position, and the &quot;pā&quot; was surrounded by the afternoon of 29 April, with a major breach in the walls. He had already sent 730 men of the 68th Regiment of Foot behind the &quot;pā&quot; to cut off any retreat. He then ordered 300 men of the 43rd Regiment of Foot and marines of the Royal Navy to exploit the breach but the attempt to do so was beaten back with the attacking soldiers engaged in a full scale retreat. On seeing the attacking force fleeing the battle, Cameron attempted to rally them but was unable to do so and retreated to his tent to brood. 
Although the &quot;pā&quot; was abandoned overnight, the garrison was able to slip away practically unmolested. With losses of over 100 killed and wounded, the Battle of Gate Pā was a major defeat for Cameron. Already criticised for his overly cautious approach to the campaign in the Waikato, Cameron&#x27;s conduct of the battle came under question. He struggled to explain the poor performance of the troops making the attack, but noted the losses among the officers may have affected the rank and file. In fact, the attackers had been deceived by a lack of defensive fire from the &quot;pā&quot; and once drawn in, were set upon by well-concealed warriors.

Cameron met with Grey on 12 May and shortly afterwards decided to cease offensive engagements in Tauranga. He returned to Auckland with the bulk of his forces, citing unfavourable weather as an excuse. He left the local commander, Lieutenant-Colonel H. Greer, with instructions to maintain a defensive posture while Grey, stunned at the outcome of the battle, negotiated terms with Ngai-te-Rangi for an end to hostilities in the area. Within a few weeks, Greer, while conducting defensive patrols in accordance with Cameron&#x27;s directives, inflicted a defeat on a large force of Māori attempting to establish defensive positions at Te Ranga, from Te Papa. The majority of the Ngai-te-Rangi tribe surrendered shortly afterwards on relatively favourable terms, thus ending the fighting in Tauranga. This prompted the Colonial Government to urge Cameron to resume his offensive operations but he declined to do so, disillusioned about the prospects of a successful outcome to a military campaign. Although the British did not destroy the King Movement, the defeats at Te Ranga and Orakau effectively ended the fighting in the Waikato and the tribes there would eventually cede their land to the colonial government.

===Return to Taranaki===
As the Tauranga Campaign wound down, fighting flared up again in the Taranaki and in the Wanganui. Both Grey and the colonial government, considering this a further attempt at Māori independence, wanted to suppress this latest outbreak. At this time, the British forces were beginning the process of withdrawing from New Zealand, transferring responsibility for the colony&#x27;s internal security to its own military. This added impetus to the colonial government&#x27;s need to take action in the Taranaki while British soldiers were still available.

With reservations, Cameron agreed to mount a campaign in the Wanganui. However, he saw this conflict as unnecessary, and nothing more than a desire by the Colonial Government for more Māori land and believed that British soldiers should not be used to achieve this. Furthermore, he considered that he would need at least two years to achieve success and reinforcements for his existing army would be required. He commenced the campaign on 24 January 1865, moving with 1,200 soldiers from Wanganui northward across southern Taranaki to Nukumaru. Here, his force resisted attacks from a large force of over 400 Māori warriors. After two days, having killed 14 soldiers for the loss of 23 warriors, the Māori withdrew. They moved to a robust &quot;pā&quot; at Weraroa, expecting Cameron to come after them. Despite urging from Grey to do so, he refused, fully aware of the futility of frontal attacks on &quot;pā&quot;. Instead, he moved further north leaving a garrison and a series of redoubts facing the Weraroa &quot;pā&quot;. On 13 March, he encountered a force of 200 warriors from the Ngati Ruanui tribe and soundly beat them on open ground at Te Ngaio. At the end of March, he reached the Waingongoro River and halted his advance there, from Wanganui.

By now relations between Cameron and Grey had broken down over the former&#x27;s refusal to attack the Weraroa &quot;pā&quot;. There were already tensions between the two as a result of Cameron&#x27;s reports to the War Office often being at odds with Grey&#x27;s own sometimes deliberately misleading communications to London. Cameron&#x27;s campaign was heavily criticised by colonists as being slow, but this opinion lacked awareness of the need to ensure the security of his lines of communication along his advance. Even the Māori were contemptuous, apparently giving him the nickname &quot;The Lame Seagull&quot; for the pace of his advance. Cameron, having already resigned his command on 7 February 1865, left for Auckland in April and departed the country on 1 August 1865.

==Later life==

After his return to England, Cameron continued to hold his honorary position as regimental colonel of his old unit, the 42nd Regiment of Foot, to which he had been appointed in 1863, only relinquishing it in 1881 when the regiment merged with the 73rd Regiment of Foot to form the Black Watch. He then became regimental colonel of the 1st Battalion of the Black Watch up until his death. In 1868, his temporary rank of lieutenant-general was made substantive, and he was appointed Commissioner &quot;to enquire into the present state of Military Education in this country&quot;. The same year, he was appointed as Governor of the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. On 10 September 1873, he married Louisa Flora, the fourth daughter of Andrew Maclean, the deputy inspector-general of the Royal Military College.

As governor at Sandhurst, Cameron attempted various reforms until 1875, at which time he retired from the British Army. Two years previously, he had been promoted to full general and was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. In his later years, he had to deal with published criticism of his conduct of the campaigns in New Zealand. However, these would typically downplay the fighting qualities and tactics of the Kingites. He was also involved in defending himself from a particularly aggrieved dispute with a relative of an officer killed at the Battle of Rangiriri. In his final years, his health deteriorated and he died at Kidbrook, in Kent, on 7 June 1888. Survived only by his wife as the couple had no children, he was buried at Brompton Cemetery in London. The Chapel of the Royal Military Academy includes a memorial to Cameron, which reads: 

In Memory of General Sir Duncan Cameron, G.C.B., Colonel of the Black Watch. Died 8 June 1888, aged 80. He served through the Eastern Campaign, 1854–55; commanded the 42nd Regiment at the Alma, and the Highland Brigade at Balaclava. Commanded the Forces in New Zealand during the War of 1863–65. Was Governor of this College, 1868–75.

<doc id="313436" wikidata="Q181182" url="?curid=313436" title="Hassan Nasrallah">
<text>Hassan Nasrallah (, ; 31 August 196027 September 2024) was a Lebanese cleric and politician who served as the third secretary-general of Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist political party and militia, from 1992 until his assassination in 2024.

Born into a Shia family in the suburbs of Beirut in 1960, Nasrallah finished his education in Tyre, when he briefly joined the Amal Movement, and afterward at a Shia seminary in Baalbek. He later studied and taught at an Amal school. Nasrallah joined Hezbollah, which was formed, declaring that its confrontation with Israel &quot;should only end when it has been removed from existence&quot;, to fight the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. After a brief period of religious studies in Iran, Nasrallah returned to Lebanon and became Hezbollah&#x27;s leader after his predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi, was assassinated by an Israeli airstrike in 1992.

Under Nasrallah&#x27;s leadership, Hezbollah acquired rockets with a longer range, which allowed them to strike at northern Israel. Israel withdrew its forces in 2000 after the 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon, a decision widely considered in Lebanon to have been due to Hezbollah&#x27;s attacks. The date of Israeli withdrawal is celebrated as a public holiday in Lebanon. Hezbollah cultivated Nasrallah&#x27;s media image as a charismatic authority, though this image was later weakened. Hezbollah&#x27;s role in ambushing an Israeli border patrol unit, leading up to the 2006 Lebanon War, was subject to criticism, though Nasrallah projected the end of the war as a Lebanese and Arab victory.

During the Syrian civil war, Hezbollah fought on the side of the Syrian government against what Nasrallah termed &quot;Islamist extremists&quot;. Nasrallah also promoted the &quot;Axis of Resistance&quot;, an informal coalition of Iran-backed groups focused on opposing Israel and the United States. After the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel followed by war, Hezbollah engaged in support of Hamas in ongoing conflict that impacted both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border. On 27 September 2024, Nasrallah was killed when the Israeli air force attacked Hezbollah&#x27;s Headquarters.

== Early life and education ==
Hassan Nasrallah was born the ninth of ten children into a Shia family in Bourj Hammoud, Matn District (an eastern suburb of Beirut), on 31 August 1960. His father, Abdul Karim Nasrallah, was born in Al-Bazouriyah, a village in Jabal Amel (Southern Lebanon) located near Tyre, and worked as a fruit and vegetables seller. Although his family was not particularly religious, Hassan was interested in theological studies. He attended the al-Najah school and later on, a public school in the predominantly Christian neighborhood of Sin el Fil.

In 1975, the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War forced the family, including Nasrallah, who was 15 at the time, to move to their ancestral home in Bazourieh, where Nasrallah completed his secondary education at the public school in Tyre. There, he briefly joined the Amal Movement, a Lebanese Shia political group.

Nasrallah studied at the Shia seminary in the Beqaa Valley town of Baalbek. The school followed the teachings of Iraqi Shi&#x27;ite scholar Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, who founded the Dawa movement in Najaf, Iraq, during the early 1960s. In 1976, at 16, Nasrallah traveled to Iraq where he was admitted into al-Sadr&#x27;s seminary in Najaf. It is said that Al-Sadr recognized Nasrallah&#x27;s qualities and Al-Sadr is quoted as saying &quot;I scent in you the aroma of leadership; you are one of the Ansar [followers] of the Mahdi...&quot;. Nasrallah was expelled from Iraq, along with dozens of other Lebanese students in 1978. Al-Sadr was imprisoned, tortured, and brutally murdered. Nasrallah was forced to return to Lebanon in 1979, by that time having completed the first part of his study, as Saddam Hussein was expelling many Shias including the future Iranian supreme leader, Ruhollah Khomeini, and also Abbas Musawi.

Back in Lebanon, Nasrallah studied and taught at the school of Amal&#x27;s leader Abbas al-Musawi, later being selected as Amal&#x27;s political delegate in Beqaa, and making him a member of the central political office. Around the same time, in 1980, Al-Sadr was executed by Hussein.

== Early activities ==
Nasrallah joined Hezbollah, which was formed to fight the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. In 1989, Hassan Nasrallah traveled to Qom, Iran, where he furthered his religious studies.

Nasrallah believed that Islam holds the solution to the problems of any society, once saying, &quot;With respect to us, briefly, Islam is not a simple religion including only prayers and praises, rather it is a divine message that was designed for humanity, and it can answer any question man might ask concerning his general and personal life. Islam is a religion designed for a society that can revolt and build a community.&quot;

In 1991, Nasrallah returned to Lebanon and the next year replaced Musawi as Hezbollah&#x27;s leader after the latter was killed by an Israeli airstrike.

== Political career ==
=== Leadership of Hezbollah ===

Nasrallah became the leader of Hezbollah after the Israelis assassinated the previous leader, Musawi, in 1992. During Nasrallah&#x27;s leadership, Hezbollah acquired rockets with a longer range, which allowed them to strike at northern Israel despite the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. In 1993, Israel carried out Operation Accountability which resulted in the destruction of much of Lebanon&#x27;s infrastructure, and Israel claimed the operation was successful. An agreement was eventually reached whereby Israel ended its attacks in Lebanon and Hezbollah agreed to stop attacks on northern Israel.

After a short pause, hostilities resumed. In 1996 Israel launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, blocking important Lebanese harbour cities and bombing a Syrian military base. After 16 days of Israeli attacks in Lebanon, the Israeli–Lebanese Ceasefire Understanding was agreed upon. Again, Hezbollah agreed to stop rocket attacks in exchange for Israel halting its attacks. As in 1993, the peace did not last for long.

In September 1997, Nasrallah&#x27;s public image changed dramatically with his speech about the news of his eldest son&#x27;s killing by Israeli forces, along with his visits to other mourning families. Nasrallah&#x27;s reaction became a media event that &quot;served to bring Lebanese nationals together as a collective&quot; and cast Nasrallah &quot;as an extraordinarily selfless leader and an organic leader with deep roots in popular culture.&quot;
In Israel, it was increasingly debated whether the presence of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon was working, since it was clear that the &#x27;security zone&#x27; could not stop Hezbollah rockets reaching into Israel. After heavy Israeli casualties in south Lebanon, some Israeli politicians argued that the conflict would only end if Israel withdrew from Lebanon. In 2000, Ehud Barak withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon. After the Israeli withdrawal, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), which was supported by Israel, was quickly overrun by Hezbollah. Some SLA members escaped to Israel, but many were captured by Hezbollah. That success against Israel greatly increased Hezbollah&#x27;s popularity within Lebanon and the Islamic world.

As a result, Nasrallah was credited in Lebanon and the Arab world for ending the Israeli occupation of the South of Lebanon, something which has greatly bolstered the party&#x27;s political standing within Lebanon. Nasrallah played a major role in a complex prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hezbollah in 2004, resulting in hundreds of Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners being freed and many human remains, including that of his son, being returned to Lebanon. The agreement was described across the Arab world as a magnificent victory for Hezbollah, and Nasrallah was personally praised for achieving these gains.
A December article in the London-based &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot; said that command of the organization&#x27;s military wing was transferred from Nasrallah to his deputy, Na&#x27;im Qasim in August 2007. Hezbollah denied the suggestion, declaring it an attempt to &quot;weaken the popularity&quot; of the movement. In October 2008, Hashem Safieddine, his cousin, was assigned to succeed Nasrallah as secretary general of Hezbollah. Widespread protests in Lebanon in October 2019 due to a deepening financial and economic crisis put pressure on the government leaders to resign, including Nasrallah himself.

Under his tenure, Hezbollah has been designated a terrorist organization, either wholly or in part, by the United States and other nations, as well as by the European Union. The Arab League designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization in 2016, but as of 2024 no longer views it as one. As of 2015, Russia was rejecting the claims that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, and considered Hezbollah a legitimate sociopolitical organization. As of 2012, China remains neutral, and maintains contacts with Hezbollah.

=== Memorandum of Understanding with Free Patriotic Movement ===
Nasrallah negotiated a Memorandum of Understanding with the Free Patriotic Movement headed by Michel Aoun, the former premier and a Maronite Christian. Aoun described the ten-point MoU in an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published in July 2006. Hezbollah agreed to disarm upon the return of its prisoners and the occupied Shebaa Farms. It also agreed to the pardon and return of fugitive South Lebanon Army (SLA) members.

The Free Patriotic Movement in turn agreed to work for reform of the confessional electoral system of the Parliament of Lebanon and move it in the direction of one man, one vote. Aoun made the point that the political process was in effect disarming Hezbollah without any loss in lives from unnecessary wars.

=== 2006 Lebanon War ===

Following an ambush by Hezbollah in Israeli territory that left three soldiers dead and two abducted, the 2006 Lebanon War started. During the war Israeli bombardments seeking Hezbollah targets caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the poorer and largely Shiite South Beirut, which is controlled by Hezbollah. On 3 August 2006, Hassan Nasrallah vowed to strike Tel Aviv in retaliation for Israel&#x27;s bombardment of Lebanon&#x27;s capital. &quot;If you hit Beirut, the Islamic resistance will hit Tel Aviv and is able to do that with God&#x27;s help,&quot; Nasrallah said in a televised address. He added that Hezbollah forces were inflicting heavy casualties on Israeli ground troops.

During the conflict, Nasrallah came under intense criticism from Arab countries, including Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. Jordan&#x27;s King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak warned on 14 July of the risk of &quot;the region being dragged into adventurism that does not serve Arab interests,&quot; while the Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal called the Hezbollah attacks &quot;unexpected, inappropriate and irresponsible acts.&quot; He went further, saying, &quot;These acts will pull the whole region back to years ago, and we cannot simply accept them.&quot;

Nasrallah also came under intense criticism from some in Lebanon. Walid Jumblatt, leader of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and the most prominent leader of the Druze community, spoke out quite forcefully: &quot;Great, so he&#x27;s a hero. But I&#x27;d like to challenge this heroism of his. I have the right to challenge it, because my country is in flames. Besides, we did not agree&quot;. Jumblatt is also quoted as saying: &quot;He is willing to let the Lebanese capital burn while he haggles over terms of surrender&quot;.

At the end of the 2006 war, Nasrallah&#x27;s speech solidified his public image as a &quot;charismatic leader in the media age,&quot; according to Dina Matar, a scholar of Arab media. The speech made him a &quot;symbol of pan-Arab national heroism&quot; and it included this appeal to the Lebanese nation: Our victory is not the victory of the party... it is not the victory of a party or a community; rather it is a victory for Lebanon, for the real Lebanese people, and every free person in the world... Your resistance, which offered in the 2000 victory a model for liberation, offered in the year 2006 a model for steadfastness; legendary steadfastness and miraculous steadfastness. It is strong proof for all Arabs and Muslims, and all rulers, armies and peoples... The Lebanese resistance provided strong proof to all Arab and Islamic armies...What is known as the &quot;Green Flood&quot; (&quot;Al-sayl al-akhdhar&quot;) came after the war, according to Iranian-born journalist Amir Taheri. &quot;This refers to the massive amounts of U.S. dollar notes that Hezbollah is distributing among all the citizens that were effected from the war in Beirut and the south. The dollars from Iran are ferried to Beirut via Syria and distributed through networks of militants. Anyone who can prove that his home was damaged in the war receives $12,000, a tidy sum in wartorn Lebanon&quot;.

In a TV interview aired on Lebanon&#x27;s New TV station on 27 August 2006, Nasrallah said that he would not have ordered the capture of two Israeli soldiers if he had known it would lead to such a war: &quot;We do not think, even one percent, that the capture led to a war at this time and of this magnitude. I&#x27;m convinced and sure that this war was planned and that the capture of these hostages was just their excuse to start their pre-planned war, but if I had known on July 11... that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it? I say no, absolutely not&quot;.

=== 2008 alleged assassination attempt ===
On 15 October 2008, Iraqi news source Almalaf, reported that Nasrallah had been poisoned the previous week, quoting sources in Lebanon, and that he was saved by Iranian doctors who went to Lebanon to treat him. The sources told the paper that a particularly poisonous chemical substance was used against the Shia militia leader. His medical condition was apparently critical for several days until Iranian doctors came and managed to save his life. Almalaf claimed that the sources believed it was highly likely that the poisoning was an Israeli assassination attempt.

Hezbollah denied that Nasrallah had been poisoned. Lebanese parliament member Al-Hajj Hassan, a member of Hezbollah, said: &quot;This is a lie and a fabrication. It&#x27;s true that I haven&#x27;t seen Nasrallah this past week, but he&#x27;s okay.&quot; The Iranian doctors arrived on Sunday at approximately 11:00 pm, apparently on a special military flight. According to Almalaf, officials considered flying Nasrallah to Iran for further treatment.

On 25 October 2008, in an interview with the Hezbollah-owned Al-Manar channel, Nasrallah denied the assassination attempt, accusing the Israelis and Americans of fabricating the story and considering it as part of the ongoing psychological war against Hezbollah that aimed to imply that the party was suffering from internal disputes and assassination plots.

Nasrallah also said that &quot;if research was done on the internet websites posting such unfounded information, it would reveal that they are all being run from that same dark room, and that their aim is to serve American-Israeli interests.&quot; He added that at first the organization had considered denying the false information with a written message, &quot;but when the news agencies began to publish it we decided to hold a televised interview, and here I am before you telling you I was not poisoned.&quot;

=== Syrian Civil War ===
On 25 May 2013, Nasrallah announced that Hezbollah is fighting in the Syrian civil war against &quot;Islamist extremists&quot; and &quot;pledged that his group will not allow Syrian militants to control areas that border Lebanon&quot;. He confirmed that Hezbollah was fighting in the strategic Syrian town of Qusair on the same side as the Syrian army. In the televised address, he said, &quot;If Syria falls in the hands of America, Israel and the takfiris, the people of our region will go into a dark period.&quot;

In July 2014, Nasrallah&#x27;s nephew was killed fighting in Syria. On 27 September 2024, it was reported that his daughter, Zainab, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, however, that turned out to be false.

== Views on international politics ==

=== Approach to Israel and Anti-Semitism ===
In his anti-Israel statements, Nasrallah has called for the end of the State of Israel, and opposed reconciliation, as the only path to justice..&quot; He has also highlighted Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapons as a security threat.

Despite declaring &quot;death to Israel&quot; and &quot;death to America&quot; in his public appearances, Nasrallah said in an interview to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2003: &quot;At the end of the road, no one can go to war on behalf of the Palestinians, even if that one is not in agreement with what the Palestinians agreed on.&quot; When asked in 2004 whether he was prepared to live with a two-state settlement between Israel and Palestine, he said he would not sabotage what is a &quot;Palestinian matter&quot;, but that until such a settlement is reached, he will continue to encourage Palestinian resistance.

Lebanese writer, Amal Saad-Ghorayeb quotes Hassan Nasrallah as saying, &quot;If we searched the entire world for a person more cowardly, despicable, weak and feeble in psyche, mind, ideology and religion, we would not find anyone like the Jew. Notice, I do not say the Israeli.&quot; Charles Glass questions the attribution of the quote to Nasrallah, noting that both the footnote in Saad-Ghorayeb&#x27;s book and her original dissertation instead attribute the quote to an interview she conducted with a Hezbollah member of the Lebanese Parliament, Muhammad Fneish.

In a 1998 speech marking the Day of Ashura, and published in what was Hassan Nasrallah&#x27;s official website at that time, Nasrallah referred to Israel as &quot;the state of the grandsons of apes and pigs – the Zionist Jews&quot; and condemned them as &quot;the murderers of the prophets.&quot; The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), a pro-Israel media watchdog group, MEMRI, and Shaul Shai interpret this language as broadly antisemitic. Nasrallah said in a speech delivered in Beirut and aired on Al-Manar TV on 28 September 2001: &quot;What do the Jews want? They want security and money. Throughout history the Jews have been Allah&#x27;s most cowardly and avaricious creatures. If you look all over the world, you will find no one more miserly or greedy than they are.&quot;

After the signing of the Hebron Agreement in 1998 between the Chairman of the PLO Yasser Arafat and Israel, Nasrallah called for Arafat&#x27;s assassination saying Palestinian police must come out “like Khaled al-Islambuli&quot; (the assassin of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat) and said that Arafat’s presence on earth is a &quot;disgrace”.

Journalist Badih Chayban in a 23 October 2002 article in &quot;The Daily Star&quot; wrote that Nasrallah said, &quot;If they [the Jews] all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide.&quot; Charles Glass believes that the quotation was likely a fabrication, citing other published accounts of Nasrallah&#x27;s speech that had no reference to the anti-Semitic comment, and unconfirmed statements by an unnamed person who Glass said is the editor-in-chief of the Lebanese newspaper which published the quotes, that questioned both the translation and the &quot;agenda of the translator.&quot; However, the Nasrallah speech in question is published on Hezbollah&#x27;s website. Chayban shared the link with Glass, who did not correct his accusations accordingly. Glass also wrote that a Hezbollah spokeswoman, Wafa Hoteit, denied that Nasrallah made the statement. More recently, the relevant excerpt from the speech, along with Arabic transcription and English translation, have been published online.

While reading the party&#x27;s new political manifesto in 2009, Nasrallah disavowed opposition to Jews, only to Israel: &quot;Our problem with [the Israelis] is not that they are Jews, but that they are occupiers who are raping our land and holy places.&quot; Speaking on Al Quds Day on 2 August 2013, Nasrallah said that Israel &quot;is a cancer that must be eradicated.&quot;

=== 11 September 2001 attacks and the United States ===
&quot;What do the people who worked in those two World Trade Center towers, along with thousands of employees, women and men, have to do with war that is taking place in the Middle East?... Therefore we condemned this act—and any similar act we condemn... I said nothing about the Pentagon, meaning we remain silent. We neither favored nor opposed that act... Well, of course, the method of Osama bin Laden, and the fashion of bin Laden, we do not endorse them. And many of the operations that they have carried out, we condemned them very clearly.&quot;

=== On 7 October 2023, attacks on Israel ===
While calling for the &quot;liberation&quot; of Jerusalem and mentioning Israel as a &quot;Zionist existence&quot;, he called the attacks of Hamas on Israel on 7 October 2023 a heroic operation. Nasrallah had said that Hezbollah&#x27;s missile and drone attacks against northern Israel, which began immediately after 7 October, were carried out in solidarity with the Palestinians.

=== Islamist extremism ===
According to Saudi state-owned Al Arabiya, a video posted on their site is of Nasrallah giving a speech circa 1988 in which he states, &quot;Our plan, to which we, as faithful believers, have no alternative, is to establish an Islamic state... Lebanon should not be an Islamic republic on its own, but rather, part of the Greater Islamic Republic, governed by the Master of Time [the Mahdi], and his rightful deputy, the Jurisprudent Ruler, Imam Khomeini,&quot;

During the 2006 &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy, Nasrallah declared in a speech aired on Al-Manar TV and Al-Jazeera TV that: &quot;If there had been a Muslim to carry out Imam Khomeini&#x27;s &quot;fatwā&quot; against the renegade Salman Rushdie, this rabble who insult our Prophet Mohammed in Denmark, Norway and France would not have dared to do so. I am sure there are millions of Muslims who are ready to give their lives to defend our prophet&#x27;s honour and we have to be ready to do anything for that.&quot;

On 24 February 2012, in a speech in Nabi Sheet for the &quot;remembrance of the fallen martyrs Abbas al-Musawi, Ragheb Harb, and Imad Mughniyah,&quot; Hassan Nasrallah said, &quot;I say that the American administration and the American mentality lacks nothing from Satanism. But that kind of behavior and that kind of mistreatment of holy books [referring to the Quran burning incident in Afghanistan in February 2012] and prophets, and the prophets&#x27; sanctities, and others&#x27; sanctities; this behavior is Israeli and let us say it is Jewish, between quotation marks–now they will say that this is anti-Semitism–[but] the Holy Quran told us about this people: how they attacked their prophets, and how they killed their prophets, and how they affronted their prophets, and how they affronted Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, and how they affronted Mary, peace be upon her, and how they affronted Allah&#x27;s great messenger Mohammad, May God exalt and bring peace upon him and his family. This [behavior] pattern about affronting holy books, and prophets, and messengers, and sanctities; this is their mentality, and maybe they want to push things more and more toward a religious war worldwide.&quot;

=== Palestinian right of return ===
According to the pro-Israeli group CAMERA, Nasrallah said that &quot;The Lebanese refuse to give the Palestinians residing in Lebanon Lebanese citizenship, and we refuse their resettlement in Lebanon. There is Lebanese consensus on this... we thank God that we all agree on one clear and definite result; namely, that we reject the resettlement of the Palestinians in Lebanon.&quot; There is broad consensus in Lebanon against the permanent resettlement of Palestinians, due to fears that it could reignite Lebanon&#x27;s civil war. Likewise, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon consistently favor right of return over Lebanese naturalization.

== Death and funeral ==
On the evening of 27 September 2024, the Israeli Air Force launched an airstrike on Hezbollah&#x27;s headquarters in Dahieh, reportedly targeting Nasrallah. At least six people were killed and over 90 injured following the strike, with several missing. The following day, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that Nasrallah had died in the strike; Hezbollah and Lebanese authorities later confirmed his death and his body was later found under the rubble. He reportedly died from the toxic fumes he inhaled while under the rubble as he allegedly had not sustained physical wounds. Other sources suggested he had died from blunt force trauma sustained during the attack. Hashem Safieddine was assumed to be his successor but was killed by IDF airstrikes in Dahieh as well. Naim Qassem was elected secretary-general of Hezbollah on 29 October 2024. After his death, Nasrallah was temporarily buried in a secret location to avoid potential Israeli attacks on Hezbollah supporters during his funeral, which took place on 23 February 2025.

&quot;The Economist&quot; wrote in September 2024 that Nasrallah&#x27;s death would &quot;reshape&quot; Lebanon and the Middle East in ways which &quot;would have been unthinkable a year ago&quot; and that the next leader of Hezbollah would face the &quot;most precarious moment&quot; in the organization&#x27;s history owing to Israel&#x27;s destruction of almost their entire leadership. &quot;The Economist&quot; felt the Lebanese public perceived the group as &quot;humiliated&quot; and had come to resent their domination of Lebanese politics. 

=== Funeral ===

After the ceasefire and partial withdrawal of Israeli forces in Lebanon, a funeral for Nasrallah and Safieddine was held in the capital on 23 February 2025. With an estimate of 450,000 to 1,400,000 attended the funeral, which main event was held at the Camille Chamoun Sports City stadium, many of the attendees were flying the Hezbollah flag and held portraits of Nasrallah and Safieddine. Senior Hezbollah official Ali Daamoush claimed that about 800 personalities from 65 countries would attend the funeral, in addition to thousands of individuals and activists from around the world. 

Representatives from Iran, Iraq and Yemen attended the funeral with Iran&#x27;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the leaders as &quot;two heroes of the resistance&quot; in a speech.

Hours before the funeral began at 13:00 local time, Israeli air forces launched air strikes in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers, and flew low over Beirut. Later Israel&#x27;s Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that Israeli planes were flying over the stadium while the funeral took place to &quot;convey a clear message: whoever threatens to destroy Israel – that will be the end of them&quot;. 

Nasrallah&#x27;s body was then buried in Beirut, and Safieddine&#x27;s in his hometown of Deir Qanoun an-Naher in Southern Lebanon.

By playing a key part in ending the Israeli occupation, Nasrallah became a &quot;national hero&quot; in Lebanon. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported that an Arab politician called him as the &quot;most powerful man in the Middle East&quot; and the &quot;only Arab leader who actually does what he says he&#x27;s going to do&quot;. Al Jazeera compared him to other Arab leaders such as Yasser Arafat and Gamal Abdel Nasser, and leftist revolutionaries like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, while journalist Annia Ciezadlo described him as an &quot;emblem of Islam and Arab pride&quot;. Writer and analyst Amal Saad-Ghorayeb said that he is &quot;passionate&quot; but also &quot;plainspoken and practical&quot;. American activist Osama Siblani praised Nasrallah as a &quot;great leader&quot; at a 2024 Israel-Hamas war protest rally in Dearborn, Michigan.

Nasrallah was often referred to as &quot;&quot;al-Sayyid&quot; Hassan&quot; (), the honorific &quot;Sayyid&quot; denoting a claim of descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his grandson Husayn ibn Ali.

However, many Lebanese, especially Sunni Muslims and Christians, were not supportive of Nasrallah. He was often seen as an agent of Iranian interests in the region, as his close ties to Tehran led to perceptions that he prioritized Iranian objectives over Lebanese or Arab interests. Under Nasrallah&#x27;s leadership, Hezbollah had been implicated in numerous assassinations against critics, and the group has been referred to as a state within a state, serving as Iran&#x27;s proxy.

Among anti-Assad Syrians, particularly those in areas held by the opposition to Assad such as Idlib, Nasrallah was often despised. Many saw him as being complicit in the atrocities committed by the Assad regime during the Syrian civil war. Following reports of Nasrallah&#x27;s assassination, jubilant celebrations erupted in parts of Syria, especially among those opposed to the Assad regime.

=== In popular culture ===
Two popular songs were written about Nasrallah during the 2006 Israel–Hezbollah War, with vastly different views of the Hezbollah leader: &quot;The Hawk of Lebanon&quot; in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and &quot;Yalla Ya Nasrallah&quot;, against Nasrallah, in Israel.

In 2007, Lebanese singer Alaa Zalzali composed a tribute song entitled &quot;Ya Nasrallah&quot;. Another popular song composed in tribute to him was by Lebanese Christian singer Julia Boutros, called &quot;Ahebba&#x27;i&quot;, meaning &quot;my loved ones&quot;, which was inspired by Nasrallah&#x27;s words in a televised message he sent to Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon during the 2006 war.

== Personal life ==
Nasrallah married Fatima Mustafa Yassine in 1978. They had four sons and one daughter, namely Mohammad Hadi Hassan Nasrallah, Mohammad Jawad Hassan Nasrallah, Zeinab Hassan Nasrallah, Mohammad Ali Hassan Nasrallah, and Mohammad Mahdi Hassan Nasrallah.

On the night of 12 September 1997, four Hezbollah fighters were killed in an Israeli ambush near Mlikh. One of the dead was eighteen-year-old Muhammad Hadi, Nasrallah&#x27;s eldest son. Five Lebanese soldiers and a woman were killed in a simultaneous airstrike north of the security zone. The attacks were seen as a response to the operation a week earlier in which twelve Israeli commandos were killed. Nasrallah was quoted as saying on receiving the news of his son&#x27;s death: &quot;I am proud to be the father of one of the martyrs&quot;.

When the IDF released photos of his son&#x27;s body and offered to exchange it for body parts of those killed in the earlier ambush, Nasrallah responded: &quot;Keep it. We have many more men like Hadi ready to offer themselves to the struggle&quot;. There was a seven-day mourning period held in south Beirut, which was attended by an estimated two hundred thousand people daily.
His son&#x27;s remains were returned to Lebanon in 2004, as part of the prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hezbollah where Nasrallah played a major role. According to Syrian opposition media, Nasrallah was a brother-in-law of Hezbollah commander Wissam al-Tawil, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in January 2024.

On 25 May 2024, Hezbollah media said that Nasrallah&#x27;s mother, Hajja Umm Hassan, had died. Nasrallah&#x27;s son-in-law Hassan Jaafar al-Qasir was killed by an Israeli strike on 2 October 2024, five days after Nasrallah&#x27;s assassination.

<doc id="313439" wikidata="Q860574" url="?curid=313439" title="Daito Bunka University">
<text>is a private university with two campuses: one at Itabashi in Tokyo and the other at Higashi Matsuyama in Saitama, Japan. The university is known for its sports program, which is renowned in rugby and distance running, with the Ekiden team coming fourth in the prestigious January 2009 New Year Hakone Ekiden. Daito Bunka focuses primarily on cultural arts and humanities. It is known as one of the top calligraphy schools in the nation and one of the few universities in Japan to teach Arabic and Urdu.

==History==
The original university was established in 1923 as and was an attempt to found a new school focused upon learning from Asian rather than Western influences. It gradually became associated with the efforts of nationalists and militarists in the grand plan of a Pan-Asiatic Co-Prosperity Sphere, and graduates of the university, well versed in Asian languages and cultures, were seen as ideal colonial experts and administrators.

With defeat in war, Daito graduates petitioned the Occupation authorities to reform the university as a truly Pan-Asian liberal arts college to nurture peace and understanding throughout Asia. The authorities granted this request, and land was provided for the new university in Itabashi Ward, northern Tokyo, with the renamed being founded in 1949. The name eventually reverted to Daito Bunka University in 1953, following the end of the Allied Occupation the previous year.

Daito Bunka University has a sister school in New Zealand: Avondale University in Auckland.

==Faculties==
The university has eight faculties: the Faculty of Literature, Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Foreign Languages, Faculty of Law, Faculty of International Relations, Faculty of Business Administration, Faculty of Environmental Affairs; most recently the Faculty of Sports and Health Science was founded in 2005.

Each has its own distinctions. The Faculty of International Relations (founded in 1986) is perhaps closest to the original liberal foundation principles of 1923, as all students are required to learn one of nine Asian languages (Chinese, Korean, Urdu, Hindi, Arabic, Persian, Thai, Indonesian, Vietnamese) for at least two of their four years of undergraduate study, in addition to one year of English. Most students participate in school festivals celebrating Asian language and culture, such as Asia Week and the Asian Language Speech Contest. Most years, over two-thirds of undergraduates participate in the Area Studies Tour where they visit one of nine Asian countries, studying at a local university for several weeks, improving their language skills and cultural understanding.

==Exchange programs==
The university coordinates its exchange programs through the International Center, which works with universities around the globe. The center holds events each semester for students who have come to Daito Bunka to study in Japan. Students come from a range of countries in Asia, Africa, the Americas, Oceania, and Europe, and stay at Daito either as short-term exchange students (for one semester, usually of approximately four months), or as fully enrolled students in the standard four-year programme.

Those on short-term study usually are enrolled in one of the large number of Daito Bunka&#x27;s partner institutions. Additionally, Daito students may study overseas in a great range of countries for either long-term (one year), short-term (4–6 months), or short-program (3–6 weeks) courses, usually for European or Asian language study. Those students on long-term study courses may apply for one of two forms of Daito scholarships to support their time overseas: faculty scholarships (decided by each faculty) or International Center scholarships (selected by the Daito Bunka University International Center). Faculty scholarships usually have the greater financial value.

In 2007, Daito Bunka University opened its first overseas office in Beijing, China, reflecting the increased importance of China for Japan in economic terms and the increased importance of overseas students for Japanese universities for demographic reasons.

==Graduate schools==
Several departments and faculties have graduate schools, such as The Faculty of Law, the Faculty of International Relations and the Department of Education in the Faculty of Literature.

==Extension Center==
Daito operates an Extension Center which is aimed at providing university-level education opportunities for non-university students as a form of corporate social responsibility and as a means to forge relations with local communities of its two campuses. The Extension Center provides education opportunities for university students in parallel with those offered in standard curricula, such as TOEFL or TOEIC classes and testing, and other forms of certification classes. The center is in the overall structure of , or the Daito Bunka Academy, which is the trust under which the university and associated institutions exist.

==University culture==
Daito Bunka is a little unusual in not having a single &#x27;founder&#x27;, dominant leader, founding family, or religious affiliation, all of which are common among Japanese private universities. Also, while there is a high school on the Daito Bunka Gakuen at the Itabashi Campus, the , there is no &quot;escalator system&quot; of automatic entry into the university for those students as can be found at other universities in Japan.

<text>Joseph Henry Simon (born Hymie Simon; October 11, 1913 – December 14, 2011) was an American comic book writer, artist, editor, and publisher. Simon created or co-created many important characters in the 1930s–1940s Golden Age of Comic Books and served as the first editor of Timely Comics, the company that would evolve into Marvel Comics.

With his partner, artist Jack Kirby, he co-created Captain America, one of comics&#x27; most enduring superheroes, and the team worked extensively on such features at DC Comics as the 1940s Sandman and Sandy the Golden Boy, and co-created the Newsboy Legion, the Boy Commandos, and Manhunter. Simon and Kirby creations for other comics publishers include Boys&#x27; Ranch, Fighting American and the Fly. In the late 1940s, the duo created the field of romance comics, and were among the earliest pioneers of horror comics. Simon, who went on to work in advertising and commercial art, also founded the satirical magazine &quot;Sick&quot; in 1960, remaining with it for over a decade. He briefly published with DC Comics in the 1970s.

Simon was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Early life==
Joe Simon was born in 1913 as Hymie Simon and raised in Rochester, New York, the son of Harry Simon, who had emigrated from Leeds, England, in 1905, and Rose (Kurland), whom Harry met in the United States. Harry Simon moved to Rochester, then a clothing-manufacturing center where his younger brother Isaac lived, and the couple had a daughter, Beatrice, in 1912. A poor Jewish family, the Simons lived in &quot;a first-floor flat which doubled as my father&#x27;s tailor shop&quot;. Simon attended Benjamin Franklin High School, where he was art director for the school newspaper and the yearbook – earning his first professional fee as an artist when two universities each paid $10 publication rights for his art deco, tempera splash pages for the yearbook sections.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Upon graduation in 1932, Simon was hired by &quot;Rochester Journal-American&quot; art director Adolph Edler as an assistant, replacing Simon&#x27;s future comics colleague Al Liederman, who had quit. Between production duties, he did occasional sports and editorial cartoons for the paper. Two years later, Simon took an art job at the &quot;Syracuse Herald&quot; in Syracuse, New York, for $45 a week, supplying sports and editorial cartoons there as well. Shortly thereafter, for $60 a week, he succeeded Liederman as art director of a paper whose name Simon recalled in his 1990 autobiography as the &quot;Syracuse Journal American&quot;, although the &quot;Syracuse Journal&quot; and the &quot;Syracuse Sunday American&quot;, were the separate weekday and Sunday papers, respectively. The paper soon closed, and Simon, at 23, ventured to New York City.

There, Simon took a room at the boarding house Haddon Hall, in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, near Columbia University. At the suggestion of the art director of the &quot;New York Journal American&quot;, he sought and found freelance work at Paramount Pictures, working above the Paramount Theatre on Broadway, retouching the movie studio&#x27;s publicity photos. He also found freelance work at Macfadden Publications, doing illustrations for &quot;True Story&quot; and other magazines. Sometime afterward, his boss, art director Harlan Crandall, recommended Simon to Lloyd Jacquet, head of Funnies, Inc., one of that era&#x27;s comic-book &quot;packagers&quot; that supplied comics content on demand to publishers testing the new medium. That day, Simon received his first comics assignment, a seven-page Western.

Four days later, Jacquet asked Simon, at the behest of Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman, to create a flaming superhero like Timely&#x27;s successful character the Human Torch. From this came Simon&#x27;s first comic-book hero, the Fiery Mask. Simon used the pseudonym Gregory Sykes on at least one story during this time, &quot;King of the Jungle&quot;, starring Trojak The Tiger Man, in Timely&#x27;s &quot;Daring Mystery Comics&quot; #2 (Feb. 1940).

===Simon and Kirby===

During this time, Simon met Fox Feature Syndicate comics artist Jack Kirby, with whom he would soon have a storied collaboration lasting a decade-and-a-half. Speaking at a 1998 San Diego Comic-Con panel, Simon recounted the meeting:

and remained a team across the next two decades. In the early 2000s, original art for an unpublished, five-page Simon and Kirby collaboration titled &quot;Daring Disc&quot;, which may predate the duo&#x27;s &quot;Blue Bolt&quot;, surfaced. Simon published the story in the 2003 updated edition of his autobiography, &quot;The Comic Book Makers,&quot; co-authored with his son, Jim.

After leaving Fox and landing at pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman&#x27;s Timely Comics (the future Marvel Comics), where Simon became the company&#x27;s first editor, the Simon and Kirby team created the seminal patriotic hero Captain America. &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1 (March 1941), going on sale in December 1940 – a year before the bombing of Pearl Harbor but already showing the hero punching Hitler in the jaw – sold nearly one million copies. They remained on the hit series as a team through issue #10, and were established as a notable creative force in the industry. After the first issue was published, Simon asked Kirby to join the Timely staff as the company&#x27;s art director.

Despite the success of the Captain America character, Simon felt Goodman was not paying the pair the promised percentage of profits, and so sought work for the two of them at National Comics, (later named DC Comics). Simon and Kirby negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined $500 a week, as opposed to the $75 and $85 they respectively earned at Timely. Fearing that Goodman would not pay them if he found out they were moving to National, the pair kept the deal a secret while they continued producing work for the company. At some point during this time, the duo also produced Fawcett Comics&#x27; &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #1 (1941), the first complete comic book starring Captain Marvel following the character&#x27;s run as star of the superhero anthology &quot;Whiz Comics&quot;.

Kirby and Simon spent their first weeks at National trying to devise new characters while the company sought how best to utilize the pair. After a few failed editor-assigned ghosting assignments, National&#x27;s Jack Liebowitz told them to &quot;just do what you want&quot;. The pair then revamped the Sandman feature in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; and created the superhero Manhunter. In July 1942 they began the &quot;Boy Commandos&quot; feature. The ongoing &quot;kid gang&quot; series &quot;Boy Commandos&quot;, launched later that same year, was the team&#x27;s first National feature to graduate into its own title. It sold over a million copies a month, becoming National&#x27;s third best-selling title. They also scored a hit with the homefront kid-gang team, the Newsboy Legion in &quot;Star-Spangled Comics&quot;. In 2010, DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that &quot;Like Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the creative team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby was a mark of quality and a proven track record.&quot;

Harry Mendryk, art restorer on Titan Books&#x27; Simon and Kirby series of hardcover collections, believes Simon used the pseudonym Glaven on at least two covers during this time: those of Harvey Comics&#x27; &quot;Speed Comics&quot; #22 and &quot;Champ Comics&quot; #22 (both Sept. 1942), though the Grand Comics Database does not independently confirm this. Mendryk also believes that both Kirby and Simon used the pseudonym Jon Henri on a handful of other 1942 Harvey comics, as does &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in American Comic Books 1929–1999&quot;.

Simon enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II. He said in his 1990 autobiography that he was first assigned to the Mounted Beach Patrol at Long Beach Island, off Barnegat, New Jersey, for a year before being sent to boot camp near Baltimore, Maryland, for basic training. Afterward, he reported for duty with the Combat Art Corps in Washington, D.C., part of the Coast Guard Public Information Division. He was stationed there in 1944 when he met &quot;New York Post&quot; sports columnist Milt Gross, who was with the Coast Guard Public Relations Unit, and the two became roommates in civilian housing. Pursuant to his unit&#x27;s mission to publicize the Coast Guard, Simon created a true-life Coast Guard comic book that DC agreed to publish, followed by versions syndicated nationally by &quot;Parents&quot; magazine in Sunday newspaper comics sections, under the title &quot;True Comics&quot;. This led to his being assigned to create a comic book aimed at driving Coast Guard recruitment. With Gross as his writer collaborator, Simon produced &quot;Adventure Is My Career&quot;, distributed by Street and Smith Publications for sale at newsstands.

Returning to New York City after his discharge, Simon married Harriet Feldman, the secretary to Harvey Comics&#x27; Al Harvey. The Simons and the now-married Kirby and his wife and first child moved to houses diagonally across from each other on Brown Street in Mineola, New York, on Long Island, where Simon and Kirby each worked from a home studio.

===Crestwood, &quot;Black Magic&quot; and romance comics===
As superhero comics waned in popularity after the end of World War II, Simon and Kirby began producing a variety of stories in many genres. In partnership with Crestwood Publications, they developed the imprint Prize Group, through which they published &quot;Boys&#x27; Ranch&quot; and launched an early horror comic, the atmospheric and non-gory series &quot;Black Magic&quot;. The team also produced crime and humor comics, and are credited as well with publishing the first romance comics title, &quot;Young Romance&quot;, starting a successful trend.

At the urging of a Crestwood salesman, Kirby and Simon launched their own comics company, Mainline Publications, in late 1953 or early 1954, subletting space from their friend Al Harvey&#x27;s Harvey Publications at 1860 Broadway. Mainline published four titles: the Western &quot;Bullseye: Western Scout&quot;; the war comic &quot;Foxhole&quot;, since EC Comics and Atlas Comics were having success with war comics, but promoting theirs as being written and drawn by actual veterans; &quot;In Love&quot;, since their earlier romance comic &quot;Young Love&quot; was still being widely imitated; and the crime comic &quot;Police Trap&quot;, which claimed to be based on genuine accounts by law-enforcement officials. Bitter that Timely Comics&#x27; 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics, had relaunched Captain America in a new series in 1954, Kirby and Simon created &quot;Fighting American&quot;. Simon recalled, &quot;We thought we&#x27;d show them how to do Captain America&quot;. While the comic book initially portrayed the protagonist as an anti-Communist dramatic hero, Simon and Kirby turned the series into a superhero satire with the second issue, in the aftermath of the Army-McCarthy hearings and the public backlash against the Red-baiting U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy.

The partnership ended in 1955 with the comic book industry beset by self-imposed censorship, negative publicity, and a slump in sales. Simon &quot;wanted to do other things and I stuck with comics,&quot; Kirby recalled in 1971. &quot;It was fine. There was no reason to continue the partnership and we parted friends.&quot; Simon turned primarily to advertising and commercial art, while dipping back into comics on occasion. The Simon and Kirby team reunited briefly in 1959 with Simon writing and collaborating on art for Archie Comics, where the duo updated the superhero the Shield in the two-issue &quot;The Double Life of Private Strong&quot; (June–Aug. 1959), and Simon created the superhero the Fly; they went on to collaborate on the first two issues of &quot;The Adventures of the Fly&quot; (Aug.–Sept. 1959), and Simon and other artists, including Al Williamson, Jack Davis, and Carl Burgos, did four issues before Simon moved on to work in commercial art.

===Silver Age of Comics and later===
Through the 1960s, Simon produced promotional comics for the advertising agency Burstein and Newman, becoming art director of Burstein, Phillips and Newman from 1964 to 1967. Concurrently, in 1960, he founded the satirical magazine &quot;Sick&quot;, a competitor of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, and edited and produced material for it for over a decade.

During this period, known to fans and historians as the Silver Age of Comic Books, Simon and Kirby again reteamed for Harvey Comics in 1966, updating Fighting American for a single issue (Oct. 1966). Simon, as owner, packager, and editor, also helped launch Harvey&#x27;s original superhero line, with &quot;Unearthly Spectaculars&quot; #1–3 (Oct. 1965 – March 1967) and &quot;Double-Dare Adventures&quot; #1–2 (Dec. 1966 – March 1967), the latter of which introduced the influential writer-artist Jim Steranko to comics.

In 1968, Simon created the two-issue DC Comics series &quot;Brother Power the Geek&quot;, about a mannequin given a semblance of life who wanders philosophically through 1960s hippie culture. &quot;Superman&quot; editor Mort Weisinger harbored an admitted dislike for the hippie subculture of the 1960s and felt that Simon portrayed them too sympathetically which helped to bring a quick end to the title. Simon and artist Jerry Grandenetti then created DC&#x27;s four-issue &quot;Prez&quot; (Sept. 1973 – March 1974), about America&#x27;s first teen-age president and the three-issue &quot;Champion Sports&quot; (Nov. 1973 – March 1974). That same year, Simon returned to the romance genre as editor of &quot;Young Romance&quot; and &quot;Young Love&quot; and oversaw a &quot;Black Magic&quot; reprint series.

Simon and Kirby teamed one last time later that year, with Simon writing the first issue (Winter 1974) of a six-issue new incarnation of the Sandman. Simon and Grandenetti then created the Green Team: Boy Millionaires in the DC anthology series &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #2 (May 1975), and the freakish Outsiders in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #10 (Jan. 1976).

In 1999, Joe Simon regained the rights to the Fly and Lancelot Strong thanks to copyright termination.

===21st century===
In the 2000s, Simon turned to painting and marketing reproductions of his early comic book covers. He appeared in various news media in 2007 in response to Marvel Comics&#x27; announced &quot;death&quot; of Captain America in &quot;Captain America&quot; vol. 5, #25 (March 2007), stating, &quot;It&#x27;s a hell of a time for him to go. We really need him now&quot;.

For a concept called ShieldMaster (1998), created by Jim Simon, Joe Simon provided prototype art. Shieldmaster, under the direction of Joe&#x27;s son, Jim, was also published in the comic books &quot;Futura&quot; and &quot;Étranges Aventures&quot;. A graphic novel format ShieldMaster was published in 2015 by Future Retro Entertainment. ShieldMaster comics have also been published by Jim&#x27;s son, Jesse Simon. 

Simon is among the interview subjects in &quot;Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle&quot;, a three-hour documentary narrated by Liev Schreiber that premiered posthumously on PBS in October 2013.

Simon&#x27;s grandchildren attended the Los Angeles premiere of &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; and phoned Simon from the red carpet when his name was announced as the creator of the character. Though not present at the premiere, Joe Simon got to see &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; before he died in December 2011.

In 2024, Shieldmaster encounters several Joe Simon characters in Blast to Past, a one-shot with Shieldmaster traveling to the year 1963 and encountering several characters created or co-created by Joe Simon such as Fighting, American, The Fly, Lancelot Strong, Comics. Stuntman and Captain 3-D.

==Personal life==
Simon was married to Harriet Feldman. The Simons had two sons and three daughters.

Simon died in New York City on December 14, 2011, at the age of 98, after a brief illness.

Marvel Comics dedicated &quot;Avenging Spider-Man&quot; #5 to Simon.

<text>Attis (; , also , , ) was the consort of Cybele, in Phrygian and Greek mythology.

His priests were eunuchs, the &quot;Galli&quot;, as explained by origin myths pertaining to Attis castrating himself. Attis was also a Phrygian vegetation deity. His self-mutilation, death, and resurrection represents the fruits of the earth, which die in winter only to rise again in the spring.

According to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Attis transformed himself into a pine tree.

== History ==
An Attis cult began around 1250 BCE in Dindymon (today&#x27;s Murat Dağı of Gediz, Kütahya, Turkey). He was originally a local semi-deity of Phrygia, associated with the great Phrygian trading city of Pessinos, which lay under the lee of Mount Agdistis. The mountain was personified as a &quot;daemon&quot;, whom foreigners associated with the Great Mother Cybele.

In the late 4th century BCE, a cult of Attis became a feature of the Greek world. The story of his origins at Agdistis recorded by the traveller Pausanias have some distinctly non-Greek elements.

Pausanias was told that the &quot;daemon&quot; Agdistis initially bore both male and female sexual organs. The Olympian gods feared Agdistis and they conspired to cause Agditis to accidentally castrate itself, ridding itself of its male organs. From the hemorrhage of Agdistis germinated an almond tree. When the fruits ripened, Nana, daughter of the river Sangarius, took an almond, put it in her bosom, and later became pregnant with baby Attis, whom she abandoned.

The infant was tended by a he-goat. As Attis grew, his long-haired beauty was godlike, and his parent, Agdistis (as Cybele) then fell in love with him. But Attis&#x27; foster parents sent him to Pessinos, where he was to wed the king&#x27;s daughter.

According to some versions the king of Pessinos was Midas. Just as the marriage-song was being sung, Agdistis / Cybele appeared in her transcendent power, and Attis went mad and
castrated himself under a pine. When he died as a result of his self-inflicted wounds, violets grew from his blood. Attis&#x27; father-in-law-to-be, the king who was giving his daughter in marriage, followed suit, prefiguring the self-castrating corybantes who devoted themselves to Cybele. The heartbroken Agdistis begged Zeus, the Father God, to preserve Attis so his body would never decay or decompose.

At the temple of Cybele in Pessinus, the mother of the gods was still called Agdistis, the geographer Strabo recounted.

As neighbouring Lydia came to control Phrygia, the cult of Attis was given a Lydian context too. Attis is said to have introduced to Lydia the cult of the Mother Goddess Cybele, incurring the jealousy of Zeus, who sent a boar to destroy the Lydian crops. Then certain Lydians, with Attis himself, were killed by the boar. Pausanias adds, to corroborate this story, that the Gauls who inhabited Pessinos abstained from pork. This myth element may have been invented solely to explain the unusual dietary laws of the Lydian Gauls. In Rome, the eunuch followers of Cybele were called &quot;galli&quot;.

Julian describes the orgiastic cult of Cybele and its spread.
It began in Anatolia and was adopted in Greece, and eventually Republican Rome; the cult of Attis, her reborn eunuch consort, accompanied her.

== Literature ==
The first literary reference to Attis is the subject of one of the most famous poems by Catullus (Catullus 63), apparently before Attis had begun to be worshipped in Rome, as Attis&#x27; worship began in the early Empire.

In 1675, Jean-Baptiste Lully, who was attached to Louis XIV&#x27;s court, composed an opera titled &quot;Atys.&quot; In 1780, Niccolo Piccinni composed his own &quot;Atys&quot;.

Oscar Wilde mentions Attis&#x27; self-mutilation in his poem &quot;The Sphinx&quot;, published in 1894:
:&quot;And Atys with his blood-stained knife
: were better than the thing I am.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
Emperor Julian&#x27;s &quot;Hymn to the Mother of Gods&quot; contains a detailed Neoplatonic analysis of Attis. In that work Julian says: &quot;Of him [Attis] the myth relates that, after being exposed at birth near the eddying stream of the river Gallus, he grew up like a flower, and when he had grown to be fair and tall, he was beloved by the Mother of the Gods. And she entrusted all things to him, and moreover set on his head the starry cap.&quot; On this passage, the scholiast (Wright) says: &quot;The whole passage implies the identification of Attis with nature...cf. 162A where Attis is called &#x27;Nature,&#x27; φύσις.&quot;

== Archaeological finds ==
The most important representation of Attis is the lifesize statue discovered at Ostia Antica, near the mouth of Rome&#x27;s river. The statue is of a reclining Attis, after the emasculation. In his left hand is a shepherd&#x27;s crook, in his right hand a pomegranate. His head is crowned with a pine garland with fruits, bronze rays of the sun, and on his Phrygian cap is a crescent moon. It was discovered in 1867 at the Campus of the Magna Mater together with other statues. The objects seem to have been hidden there in late antiquity. A plaster cast of it sits in the apse of the Sanctuary of Attis at the Campus of the Magna Mater, while the original was moved to the Vatican Museums.

A marble bas-relief depicting Cybele in her chariot and Attis, from Magna Graecia, is in the archaeological museum in Venice. The pair also feature prominently on the silver Parabiago plate.

A finely executed silvery brass Attis that had been ritually consigned to the Moselle River was recovered during construction in 1963 and is kept at the Rheinisches Landesmuseum of Trier. It shows the typically Anatolian costume of the god: trousers fastened together down the front of the legs with toggles and the Phrygian cap.

In 2007, in the ruins of Herculaneum a wooden throne was discovered adorned with a relief of Attis beneath a sacred pine tree, gathering cones. Various finds suggest that the cult of Attis was popular in Herculaneum at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE.

== Conflation with the god Atys ==
Nineteenth century scholarship wrongly identified the god &quot;Attis&quot; with the similar-sounding name of the god &quot;Atys&quot;. The &quot;name&quot; &quot;Atys&quot; is often seen in ancient Aegean cultures; it was mentioned by Herodotus,
however Herodotus was describing Atys, the son of Croesus, a human in a historical account. The 19th-century conflation of the man Atys&#x27;s name with the mythology of the god he was presumably named after, &quot;Atys the sun god, slain by the boar&#x27;s tusk of winter&quot;, and hence a connection to similar-sounding Attis was a mistake, but the long-standing error is still found in modern sources.

<text>The Battle of Manners Street refers to a riot involving American servicemen and New Zealand servicemen and civilians outside the Allied Services Club in Manners Street, Te Aro, Wellington in 1943. The club was a social centre, open to all military personnel.

== Background ==
During 1942–1944, between 15,000 and 45,000 American servicemen were stationed in New Zealand, mostly in camps in or near Auckland and Wellington. There were cultural differences between Americans and New Zealanders. New Zealand women found the US servicemen to be handsome and polite, and they had more money than New Zealand soldiers. This led to romantic liaisons between American troops and New Zealand women, sparking calls of an &quot;American invasion&quot;. Many New Zealand soldiers resented the idea of relationships between New Zealanders and American soldiers, leading to tense relations between the two parties.

Another source of tension was US servicemen&#x27;s attitudes towards Māori people. White soldiers from the American south were not comfortable socialising with Māori soldiers. In 1942 the New Zealand government published a guide book for US servicemen, titled &quot;Meet New Zealand Guide,&quot; which reminded the Americans that &quot;the Maori today occupy a position in society socially and politically equal to that of any pakeha or white New Zealander&quot;. A memo sent to the Prime Minister&#x27;s office said that New Zealanders should &quot;be friendly and sympathetic towards the coloured American troops—but remember that they are not accustomed in their own country to close and intimate relationships with white people&quot;. Anyone finding themselves in the company of both white and black American troops was advised to &quot;avoid unpleasantness&quot;.

The Allied Services Club was set up in the former Waldorf Restaurant in Manners Street in July 1942, as a place where soldiers could socialise and get a meal. The club was staffed by volunteers and featured a buffet counter, a dance floor, a lounge and an inquiries office. The club was intended primarily for soldiers from overseas, but was open to anyone serving in the war.

==Riot==
During this time period, hotel bars closed at 6pm and masses of inebriated patrons were then ejected into the streets. This was known colloquially as the &#x27;six o&#x27;clock swill&#x27;. Around 6pm on the evening of 3 April 1943, fighting broke out between US servicemen and New Zealand soldiers and civilians outside the Allied Services Club. The brawls spread to the ANA (Army, Navy, and Air Force) Club in Willis Street and to Cuba Street and continued for hours. Civilian and military police attempted to break up the fights, but they only finally subsided as the US soldiers left town on trains back to their camps.

Reports of the riot vary. One version states that some American servicemen in the Allied Services Club objected to Māori soldiers also using the club, and began stopping Māori soldiers from entering. Many New Zealand soldiers in the area, both white and Māori, combined in opposition. The stand-off escalated when Americans took off their belts to attack those who wanted to let the Māori in. Supposedly, over a thousand servicemen and hundreds of civilians were involved, and it was rumoured for years that two Americans were killed during the riot.

An eyewitness recalled that there was a huge crowd gathered around Manners Street. Several men would be fighting, surrounded by hundreds of people cheering. American shore patrol police with batons knocked out the troublemakers, loaded them on to flat-deck trucks and took them away.

The Commissioner of Police downplayed the riots at the time, telling the &quot;Evening Post&quot; that although &quot;there was certainly a bit of a skirmish&quot; by a &quot;small crowd&quot;, nobody had been injured, hospitalised or killed. He said that one [drunken] civilian had been arrested and faced court proceedings, one New Zealand serviceman had been dealt with by military authorities and no US servicemen had been arrested or charged.

An army major wrote in an internal memo just after the event that the army had had prior intelligence that trouble might occur, and had all its military police on duty that night. He said that the disturbance was caused by a few merchant seamen who had been drinking and decided to &quot;clean up&quot; the Americans, which led to fighting. The major said that furniture at the club was damaged before the club was closed and barricaded at around 8pm. The Army&#x27;s press release &quot;for information, if any queries raised&quot; stated that a British sailor and a Marine started fighting and were encouraged by loutish civilians before Marines and drunken New Zealand soldiers joined in. This report states that four civilians were arrested

News of the riot was censored at the time, leading to a kind of mythology around the event. Recent research has not shown any evidence that over a thousand people were involved or that the brawl was racially motivated, and it&#x27;s possible that this incident was conflated with other similar disturbances. For example, on 27 April 1943 two men were arrested after a large and &quot;nasty&quot; fight erupted at the Basin Reserve between New Zealand and US troops, and in October 1943 a group of American servicemen and Māori civilians came to blows at Ōtaki over vandalism and insults to a Māori woman. A fight on 12 May 1945 in Cuba Street involved over 150 Māori and US servicemen. This fight was definitely racially motivated: Māori troops were angry at their treatment by the Americans, who tended to treat them the way they treated black Americans. Military reports stated that &quot;Maoris from whom statements were taken allege they have been insulted by the Americans and have been told by Americans not to ride in the same tramcars and that they should walk via back streets etc., that the Americans call them black curs etc. and have generally insulted the Maori race.&quot; This event did not attain the notoriety of the &#x27;Battle of Manners Street&#x27;.

<text>Vidhana Soudha () is a building in Bangalore, India which serves as the seat of the state legislature of Karnataka. It is constructed in Neo-Dravidian style and was completed in 1956.

==History==

The two houses of legislature of the princely state of Mysore, the legislative assembly and the legislative council, were established in 1881 and 1907 respectively. Sessions of the two houses took place in Mysore with joint sessions taking place in the Bangalore Town Hall. After India&#x27;s independence on 15 August 1947, Mysore acceded to India and capital of Mysore state was shifted to Bangalore with the two houses moving into Attara Kacheri, a British-built building in Cubbon Park that housed the High Court of Mysore. With the need for a more spacious quarters, a new building with two floors to accommodate both the houses was planned and the foundation stone of the building was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India on 13 July 1951 under the guidance of Sri K.C. Reddy, the first Chief Minister of Karnataka, then Mysore state, (1947-1952) Kengal Hanumanthaiah, who was elected as chief minister of Mysore after the 1952 election revised the plan. The new plan included accommodating other government offices, archives, a library and a banquet hall in the same building with artistic elements added representing the tradition of Mysore state.

==Construction==
Estimates of construction costs for the original two-storied structure stood at with the final cost of construction of the redesigned building being . The construction of the building involved more than 5,000 workers being employed. Construction of the building was completed in 1956.

==Architecture==
The building was constructed from white granite transported from Magadi and Turuvekere. It was designed in the neo-Dravidian architecture which includes elements of styles from various dynasties such as Chalukyas, Hoysalas and Vijayanagara. It measures on the ground and is tall with an east-facing front facade with 12 granite columns, tall. Leading to the porch is a flight of stairs with 45 steps, more than wide and the central dome, in diameter, is crowned by a likeness of the State Emblem of India. The phrase &quot;Government Work is God&#x27;s Work&quot; and its Kannada equivalent &quot;Sarkarada kelasa devara kelasa&quot; (in Kannada script as &quot;ಸರ್ಕಾರದ ಕೆಲಸ ದೇವರ ಕೆಲಸ&quot;) are inscribed on the entablature. In 1957, the Mysore government planned to replace the inscription with &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; at a cost of but the change did not take place.

==Similar buildings==
*Government of Karnataka constructed a similar building named Vikasa Soudha to the south of Vidhana Soudha. Initiated by the then chief minister S. M. Krishna and inaugurated in February 2005, it was intended to be an annexe building, housing some of the ministries and legislative offices.
*Suvarna Vidhana Soudha () is a building in Belgaum in Northern Karnataka which was inaugurated on 11 October 2012 by then President Pranab Mukherjee. The building serves as an alternate to Vidhana Soudha and hosts the state legislature.

<text>A wah-wah pedal, or simply wah pedal, is a type of effects pedal designed for electric guitar that alters the timbre of the input signal to create a distinctive sound, mimicking the human voice saying the onomatopoeic name &quot;wah-wah&quot;. The pedal sweeps a band-pass filter up and down in frequency to create a spectral glide. The wah-wah effect originated in the 1920s, with trumpet or trombone players finding they could produce an expressive crying tone by moving a mute in, and out of the instrument&#x27;s bell. This was later simulated with electronic circuitry for the electric guitar when the wah-wah pedal was invented. It is controlled by movement of the player&#x27;s foot on a rocking pedal connected to a potentiometer. Wah-wah effects may be used without moving the treadle as a fixed filter to alter an instrument’s timbre (known as a “cocked-wah”), or to create a &quot;wacka-wacka&quot; funk-styled rhythm for rhythm guitar playing.

An auto-wah pedal uses an envelope follower to control the filter instead of a potentiometer.

== History ==

The first wah pedal was created by Bradley J. Plunkett at Warwick Electronics Inc./Thomas Organ Company in November 1966. This pedal is the original prototype made from a transistorized MRB (mid-range boost) potentiometer bread-boarded circuit and the housing of a Vox Continental Organ volume pedal. The concept, however, was not new. Country guitar virtuoso Chet Atkins had used a similar, self-designed device on his late 1950s recordings of &quot;Hot Toddy&quot; and &quot;Slinkey&quot;. Jazz guitarist Peter Van Wood had a modified Hammond organ expression
pedal; he recorded in 1955 a version of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Summertime&quot; with a &quot;crying&quot; tone, and other recordings including humorous &quot;novelty&quot; effects. A DeArmond Tone and Volume pedal was used in the early 1960s by Big Jim Sullivan, notably in some Krew Cats instrumental tracks, and in Dave Berry&#x27;s song &quot;The Crying Game&quot;.

The creation of the modern wah pedal was an accident which stemmed from the redesign of the Vox Super Beatle guitar amplifier in 1966. Warwick Electronics Inc. also owned Thomas Organ Company and had earlier entered into an agreement with Jennings Musical Instruments (JMI) of England for Thomas to distribute the Vox name and products in the United States. In addition to distributing the British-made Vox amplifiers, the Thomas Organ Company also designed and manufactured much of the Vox equipment sold in the US. The more highly regarded British Vox amplifiers were designed by Dick Denney and made by JMI, the parent company of Vox. Warwick assigned Thomas Organ Company to create a new product line of solid state Vox amplifiers called Vox Amplifonic Orchestra, which included the Super Beatle amplifier, named to capitalize on the Vox brand name&#x27;s popularity in association with the Beatles, who used the JMI English Vox amplifiers such as the famous Vox AC30. The US-made Vox product line development was headed by musician and bandleader Bill Page. While creating the Vox Amplifonic Orchestra, the Thomas Organ Company decided to create an American-made equivalent of the British Vox amplifier but with transistorized (solid state) circuits, rather than vacuum tubes, which would be less expensive to manufacture. During the re-design of the USA Vox amplifier, Stan Cuttler, head engineer of Thomas Organ Company, assigned Brad Plunkett, a junior electronics engineer, to replace the expensive Jennings 3-position mid-range boost (MRB) circuit switch with a transistorized solid state MRB circuit.

Plunkett had lifted and bread-boarded a transistorized tone-circuit from the Thomas Organ (an electric solid state transistorized organ) to duplicate the Jennings 3-position circuit. After adjusting and testing the amplifier with an electronic oscillator and oscilloscope, Plunkett connected the output to the speaker and tested the circuit audibly. At that point, several engineers and technical consultants, including Bill Page and Del Casher, noticed the sound effect caused by the circuit. Page insisted on testing this bread-boarded circuit while he played his saxophone through an amplifier. John Glennon, an assistant junior electronics engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, was summoned to bring a volume control pedal which was used in the Vox Continental Organ so that the transistorized MRB potentiometer bread-boarded circuit could be installed in the pedal&#x27;s housing. After the installation, Page began playing his saxophone through the pedal and asked Joe Banaron, CEO of Warwick Electronics Inc./Thomas Organ Company, to listen to the effect. At this point, the first electric guitar was plugged into the prototype wah pedal by guitarist Del Casher who suggested to Joe Banaron that this was a guitar effects pedal rather than a wind instrument effects pedal. Banaron, being a fan of the big band style of music, was interested in marketing the wah pedal for wind instruments as suggested by Page rather than for the electric guitar as suggested by Casher. After a remark by Casher to Banaron regarding the Harmon mute style of trumpet playing in the famous recording of &quot;Sugar Blues&quot; from the 1930s, Banaron decided to market the wah-wah pedal using Clyde McCoy&#x27;s name for endorsement.

After the invention of the wah pedal, the prototype was modified by Casher and Plunkett to better accommodate the harmonic qualities of the electric guitar. However, since Vox had no intention of marketing the wah pedal for electric guitar players, the prototype wah-wah pedal was given to Del Casher for performances at Vox press conferences and film scores for Universal Pictures. The un-modified version of the Vox wah pedal was released to the public in February 1967 with an image of Clyde McCoy on the bottom of the pedal.

Warwick Electronics Inc. assigned Lester L. Kushner, an engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, and Brad Plunkett to write and submit the documentation for the wah-wah pedal patent. The patent application was submitted on 24 February 1967, which included technical diagrams of the pedal being connected to a four-stringed &quot;guitar&quot; (as noted from the &quot;Description of the Preferred Embodiment&quot;). Warwick Electronics Inc. was granted (&quot;foot-controlled continuously variable preference circuit for musical instruments&quot;) on 22 September 1970.

Early versions of the Clyde McCoy featured an image of McCoy on the bottom panel, which soon gave way to only his signature. Thomas Organ then wanted the effect branded as their own for the American market, changing it to Cry Baby which was sold in parallel to the Italian Vox V846. Thomas Organ&#x27;s failure to trademark the Cry Baby name soon led to the market being flooded with Cry Baby imitations from various parts of the world, including Italy, where all of the original Vox and Cry Babys were made. JEN, who had been responsible for the manufacture of Thomas Organ and Vox wah pedals, also made rebranded pedals for companies such as Fender and Gretsch and under their own JEN brand. When Thomas Organ moved production completely to Sepulveda, California and Chicago, Illinois these Italian models continued to be made and are among the more collectible wah pedals today.

Some of the most famous electric guitarists of the day were keen to adopt the wah-wah pedal soon after its release. Among the first recordings featuring wah-wah pedal were &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; by Cream with Eric Clapton on guitar and &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot; by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, both released in 1967. Hendrix also used wah wah on his famous song &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;, in intro and in soloing. According to Del Casher, Hendrix learned about the pedal from Frank Zappa, another well-known early user. Clapton, in particular, used the device on many of the Cream songs included on their second and third albums, &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; (1967) and &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; (1968) respectively. Clapton would subsequently employ it again on &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, from his good friend George Harrison&#x27;s solo album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, upon the dissolution of The Beatles in 1970. 

The wah-wah pedal increased in popularity in the following years, and was employed by guitarists such as Terry Kath of Chicago, Martin Barre of Jethro Tull, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. Kirk Hammett of Metallica would later use the pedal on many Metallica songs, most notably the guitar solo of Enter Sandman, earning him the nickname &quot;Kirk Wahmett&quot;. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd used the pedal to create the &quot;whale&quot; effect during &quot;Echoes&quot;. He discovered this effect as a result of a roadie accidentally plugging his guitar into the output of the pedal and the input being plugged into his amp. The effect was first used during live performances of &quot;The Embryo&quot; during 1970 but was then switched into &quot;Echoes&quot; as it was being developed before being released on the &quot;Meddle&quot; album on 31 October 1971. Mick Ronson used a Cry Baby while recording &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;. Michael Schenker also utilized the pedal in his work. 

One of the most famous uses of this effect is heard on Isaac Hayes&#x27;s &quot;Theme from Shaft&quot; (1971), with Charles Pitts (credited as Charles &#x27;Skip&#x27; Pitts) playing the guitar.

In addition to rock music, many R&amp;B artists have also used the wah-wah effect, including Lalo Schifrin on &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973), Johnny Pate on &quot;Shaft in Africa&quot; (1973) and James Brown on &quot;Funky President&quot; (1974). Funk band Kool &amp; the Gang, B. T. Express, and Jimmy Castor Bunch used the wah-wah pedal also. Melvin Ragin, better known by the nickname Wah Wah Watson, was a member of the Motown Records studio band, The Funk Brothers, where he recorded with artists such as The Temptations on &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, Marvin Gaye on &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;, The Four Tops, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, The Supremes, and The Undisputed Truth on &quot;Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot;.

In the late 1980s, the wah-wah pedal was revived in the British music industry by John Squire of The Stone Roses, who bought a wah-wah pedal to differentiate his sound from other contemporary acts of the time. Afterwards, the wah-wah pedal would also be used by bands such as the Happy Mondays and the Charlatans, and became one of the defining sounds of British guitar music in the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s. 

== Uses ==
The main use of the wah-wah pedal is by rocking the pedal up and down. By doing this motion, the pedal reacts by sweeping through the peak response of a frequency filter up and down in frequency to create a spectral glide.

A different function of the pedal is to use it in a fixed position, which changes how an instrument sounds by selecting a certain frequency range. A guitarist using the wah in this way selects a position on the pedal and leaves the pedal there. Depending on the position of the pedal, this will boost or cut a specific frequency. This can be used for emphasizing the &quot;sweet spot&quot; in the tonal spectrum of a particular instrument. One electric guitar player to use the pedal in this way was Jimi Hendrix, who revolutionized its application by combining a Fender Stratocaster with stacked Marshall Amplifiers (in both static and modulated mode) for lead and rhythm guitar applications unheard of before then. 

Another famous style of wah-wah playing is utilizing it for a percussive &quot;wacka-wacka&quot; effect during rhythm guitar parts. This is done by muting strings, holding down a chord and moving the pedal at the same time. This was first heard on the song &quot;Little Miss Lover&quot; (1967) on &quot;,&quot; by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. 
The &quot;wah-wah&quot; and &quot;wacka-wacka&quot; effects are often associated with the bands on 1970s TV variety shows, like those of Sonny and Cher, Flip Wilson, or Donny and Marie Osmond; or with the soundtracks of pornographic films, the sound referenced in TV commercials for Axe body spray as &quot;bow chicka wow wow.&quot;

==Other instruments==
* Bass - A wah bass solo appears on &quot;Mommy, What&#x27;s a Funkadelic?&quot;, and all through &quot;What Is Soul?&quot; on Funkadelic&#x27;s self-titled debut album (1970). Geezer Butler made extensive use of a wah pedal in the bass solo &quot;Bassically&quot; on Black Sabbath&#x27;s debut self-titled album (1970). Michael Henderson used a wah wah pedal on Miles Davis album &quot;On the Corner&quot; (1972). Chris Squire of Yes used a wah-wah pedal on his solo piece &quot;The Fish&quot; on the album &quot;Fragile&quot;. 

* Trumpet - jazz/crossover records feature wind and brass instruments with the effect – Miles Davis&#x27;s trumpet with a wah pedal was a well-known example.

* Sax - Several of Frank Zappa’s sax players such as Bunk Gardner, Ian Underwood, and Napoleon Murphy Brock played saxophones amplified through a wah-wah pedal on some of Zappa&#x27;s albums like &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;, &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, and &quot;The Dub Room Special&quot;. David Sanborn can be heard playing an alto saxophone modified by a wah-wah pedal on the David Bowie album &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975).

<text>In digital electronics, a binary decoder is a combinational logic circuit that converts binary information from the n coded inputs to a maximum of 2n unique outputs. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including instruction decoding, data multiplexing and data demultiplexing, seven segment displays, and as address decoders for memory and port-mapped I/O.

There are several types of binary decoders, but in all cases a decoder is an electronic circuit with multiple input and multiple output signals, which converts every unique combination of input states to a specific combination of output states. In addition to integer data inputs, some decoders also have one or more &quot;enable&quot; inputs. When the enable input is negated (disabled), all decoder outputs are forced to their inactive states.

Depending on its function, a binary decoder will convert binary information from n input signals to as many as 2n unique output signals. Some decoders have less than 2n output lines; in such cases, at least one output pattern may be repeated for different input values.

A binary decoder is usually implemented as either a stand-alone integrated circuit (IC) or as part of a more complex IC. In the latter case the decoder may be synthesized by means of a hardware description language such as VHDL or Verilog. Widely used decoders are often available in the form of standardized ICs.

==Types of decoders==

===1-of-n decoder===
A 1-of-n binary decoder has n output bits. This type of decoder asserts exactly one of its n output bits, or none of them, for every integer input value. The &quot;address&quot; (bit number) of the activated output is specified by the integer input value. For example, output bit number 0 is selected when the integer value 0 is applied to the inputs.

Examples of this type of decoder include:
*A &quot;3-to-8 line decoder&quot; activates one of eight output bits for each input value from 0 to 7 — the range of integer values that can be expressed in three bits. Similarly, a &quot;4-to-16 line decoder&quot; activates one of 16 outputs for each 4-bit input in the integer range [0,15].
*A &quot;BCD to decimal decoder&quot; has ten output bits. It accepts an input value consisting of a binary-coded decimal integer value and activates one specific, unique output for every input value in the range [0,9]. All outputs are held inactive when a non-decimal value is applied to the inputs.
*A demultiplexer is a 1-of-n binary decoder that is used to route a data bit to one of its n outputs while all other outputs remain inactive.

===Code translator===
Code translators differ from 1-of-n decoders in that multiple output bits may be active at the same time. An example of this is a &quot;seven-segment decoder&quot;, which converts an integer into the combination of segment control signals needed to display the integer&#x27;s value on a seven-segment display digit.

One variant of seven-segment decoder is the &quot;BCD to seven-segment decoder&quot;, which translates a binary-coded decimal value into the corresponding segment control signals for input integer values 0 to 9. This decoder function is available in standard ICs such as the CMOS 4511.

===Binary to Unary Decoder===

A binary to unary decoder converts each binary value to its associated unary representation. Unlike the 1-of-n (one-hot) decoder, multiple output bits can be asserted for each input value. These decoders can be used in DACs where each bit is equally weighted, and circuits that require a binary mask or window.

*One-hot, the format of the 1-of-n decoder&#x27;s output (or the unencoded output of a ring counter)

<text>, abbreviated to , or YNU, is a national university located in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Founded in 1876, it became a national university in 1949, and currently comprises five graduate schools and four undergraduate faculties.

The university has been evaluated highly from the business world and was ranked first in Kantō (including Greater Tokyo Area) and Kōshin&#x27;etsu region and second in Japan by personnel departments of leading companies in Japan in 2020. The university was also ranked tenth in Japan according to the ratio of the number of officers and managers produced to the number of graduates.

==History==

The predecessor of the university, Yokohama Normal School, was founded in 1876. It became a Japanese national university in 1949 by the amalgamation of Kanagawa Normal School, Kanagawa Youth Normal School, Yokohama College of Economics and the Yokohama Institute of Technology.

The university was originally planned to be named as &quot;Yokohama University&quot;, but at the time the former Yokohama City Economics College and Yokohama Vocational School also wanted to apply their names as Yokohama University. They had a consultation about the name and decided not to use name &quot;Yokohama University&quot;.

The Faculty of Business Administration was founded in 1967. The university has master&#x27;s degree programs in engineering (1962), economics (1972), business administration (1972), and education (1979). The Institute of Environmental Science and Technology was established in 1973 under the botanist Akira Miyawaki, and the Graduate School of International and Business Law was established in 1990. The Graduate School of International Development Studies was created in 1994 and the School of Law in 2004.

== Organisation ==

=== Undergraduate faculties ===
*College of Education
*College of Economics: Established in 1949 as one of the three original colleges, the College of Economics follows the great tradition of the former Yokohama Commercial College. The college (undergraduate) prides itself in contributing to the advancement of economic theory and empirics. Every year many aspiring students apply for entrance, and after an intensive four-year period of training in economic thought and research, they successfully graduate as competent experts in their fields. Recognized internationally as a center of economic study, an array of nationalities are represented in the college as lecturers, researchers and students. The College of Economics promotes cultural diversity and host many international students both on scholarships and self-funded. At the Master&#x27;s level, the Faculty of Economics is host to the Joint Japan World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program. In the fall of 2013, YNU Economics began offering M.A. and Ph.D. degrees where the course content, advising, etc. is offered entirely in the English language.
*College of Business Administration: Yokohama National University&#x27;s Faculty of Business Administration was established in 1967, and currently composed of four disciplinary areas: the Division of Business Administration, the Division of Accounting and Information, the Division of Management System Science and the Division of International Business. The faculty places emphasis on internationalization, with not only Japanese students, but also many students from overseas currently enrolled. Students are free to register subjects outside of their own division, and so are able to gain an education that covers all aspects of business administration. In the latter half of second year, students are assigned to a seminar, where they do research in a specialized area of an advising professor.

*College of Engineering Science
*College of Urban Sciences: Urban Sciences is an academic field that focuses on an important theme—how cities should be in the future—from a scientific point of view. The College of Urban Sciences was newly established in April 2017, and comprises the following four departments: (1) the Department of Urban and Social Collaboration for studying cultural and social sciences, with the objective of create a pleasant urban society and culture; (2) the Department of Architecture and Building Science for studying creative architecture, urban environments, and town development; (3) the Department of Civil Engineering for studying technology and management relating to the infrastructure supporting urban activities; and (4) the Department of Risk Management and Environmental Science for studying sustainable urban development with the understanding of natural and social environmental risks. The college pursues the development of talented people who can commit themselves to creating cities from broad perspectives that include liberal arts and scientific viewpoint.

<text>Roberto Vigoreaux Lorenzana (born January 12, 1956, in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican producer, TV show host, actor, singer, and former Senator. He is the son of TV producer Luis Vigoreaux, and the younger brother of Luisito Vigoreaux.

==Early years and studies==

Roberto Vigoreaux was born on January 12, 1956, to producer Luis Vigoreaux and Rosaura Lorenzana. He is the youngest of two sons, the other being Luisito Vigoreaux.

Vigoreaux studied at the University of Puerto Rico, and then at Loyola University New Orleans.

==Career in the media==

In 1970, Vigoreaux starred as Chago in the Walt Disney Production &quot;Cristobalito, the Calypso Colt&quot;, when he was still a young teenager. After growing up, he worked as a radio broadcaster in several stations, as well as acting in plays. Throughout his career, he has worked for stations like Radio Rock, WAPA Radio, Radio Aeropuerto and Radio Luz.

In 1984, Vigoreaux hosted the show &quot;Son del Caribe&quot;. Some time later, he moved to WAPA-TV where he starred hosting a game show called &quot;Parejo, doble, y triple&quot; with his brother, Luisito. He also hosted the show &quot;Sábado en Grande&quot;. After performing a duet on his show &quot;Sábado en Grande&quot;, with singer Lourdes Robles, Vigoreaux decided to start a musical career. In 1988, he released his first and only album titled &quot;Amores de mi vida&quot;. The album received a lukewarm response.

In 1986, both Roberto and his brother Luisito appeared in a Burger King commercial for the Puerto Rican market, where they acted and sang.

Vigoreaux has also worked as a host of several beauty pageants. He also had roles in comedies and shows like &quot;Generaciones&quot;, and musicals like &quot;Clemente&quot;, where he played the role of his father, Luis Vigoreaux. In the late 1980s he played the role of Joe Hardy in a revival of the Broadway musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, with Marian Pabón.

==Career as entrepreneur==

Vigoreaux opened a series of ice cream franchises called Scoops, with stores in San Juan, Cayey, and Bayamón.

==Career in politics: 1996–2004==

===Representative: 1996–2000===

In 1993, Vigoreaux retired from show business and began to pursue a career as a politician. In 1996, he was elected as a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives for the Popular Democratic Party (PPD).

===Senator: 2000–2004===

Vigoreaux was elected in 2000 as a senator.

====Candidate for Mayor of San Juan: 2003====

Vigoreaux announced his interest in running for mayor of the city of San Juan during the elections of 2004. However, he lost in the 2003 primaries against Eduardo Bhatia. After that, he has continued to work as an adviser to the Senate of Puerto Rico.

==Return to politics: 2011–present==

In September 2011, Vigoreaux announced his candidacy to the House of Representatives for the 2012 general elections. However, he lost at the PPD primaries held on March 18.

==Personal life==

Vigoreaux has been married to Mary Ann Cortés since 1987. They have three children.

In 1983, when Roberto was in his 20s, his father Luis Vigoreaux, was brutally murdered. The investigation revealed that Vigoreaux&#x27;s second wife, Lydia Echevarria, was complicit in his murder, after allegedly she paid two men to beat Vigoreaux.

<text>The Book of Veles (also called the Veles Book, Vles book, Vlesbook or Isenbeck&#x27;s Planks; ) is a literary forgery purporting to be a text of ancient Slavic religion and history supposedly written on wooden planks.

It contains what purport to be historical accounts interspersed with religious passages - some of a didactic, moralising character. The book refers to supposed events, the earliest of which would, if real, be datable to around the 7th century BC while the latest would have occurred around the 9th century AD.

The book was allegedly discovered in 1919 and lost in 1941. It is widely believed by scholars to be a forgery made in the 1940s–1950s, or less likely, in the early 19th century. The most decisive evidence for this is the language of the text, which is a mixture of different modern Slavic languages, with erroneous and invented linguistic forms and no regular grammar. Moreover, different modern editions of the book have different versions of the text. Regardless, some Slavic neopagans use it as a sacred text.

==Authenticity==
Most of the scholars that specialize in the field of mythological studies and Slavic linguistics (such as Boris Rybakov, Andrey Zaliznyak, Leo Klejn, and all Russian academic historians and linguists) consider it a forgery. According to these scholars the thorough analysis of the book shows that it was written sometime in the 20th century. The history of the book can be reliably traced only as far as mid-1950s, when the transcribed book and the photograph of one of the planks first appeared in a San Francisco-based, Russian émigré newspaper. Several scholars believe that the entire book is a product of collaboration of the editors of this newspaper and Yuriy Mirolyubov, who later claimed to have found the book. Others believe that either the entire book or the only plank available, were forged in the early 19th century by the Russian collector and forger Alexander Sulakadzev.

The book is written in a language using for the most part Slavic roots and different affixes found also in old East Slavic. Consequently, a large part of the book&#x27;s text, once transcribed into a modern alphabet, is readable (albeit with some difficulty) by modern speakers of Slavic languages. However, professional linguists and historians, particularly the specialists in ancient Slavic, question many features of its language — vocabulary (modern or medieval Slavic words occasionally and unwittingly used in place of their ancient equivalents), spelling, phonetics (distinct reflections of the nasal vowels, both following Polish and Serbian patterns in different places, the haphazard handling of reduced vowels, etc., etc.), grammar (grammatical forms incompatible with early Slavic languages, combinations of affixes that contradict each other in meaning), etc. These features seem to indicate that the text was artificially &quot;aged&quot; by someone with superficial knowledge of ancient Slavic, and cannot be adequately translated because of lack of any consistent grammar system. In the words of the philologist O.V. Tvorogov:
In Ukraine, whereas academic scholars agree that the book is a hoax, it became very popular among politicians who consider it genuine and believe it describes real historical facts relevant for establishing Ukrainian ethnicity. In particular, Levko Lukyanenko cited the Book of Veles as historical. In 1999, the book was included in the high school program in Ukraine as a genuine literary and historical piece. Whereas the inclusion was considered controversial in academic circles, the book remained on the program as of 2008.

==Purported description==

===History of the book&#x27;s discovery according to Mirolyubov===

In 1919, a lieutenant of the White Russian Army, Fedor Arturovich Izenbek, found a bunch of wooden planks written in strange script in a looted mansion of Kurakins near Kharkiv (Ukraine). After the defeat of the Army, Isenbeck emigrated to Belgrade, where in 1923 he unsuccessfully tried to sell the planks to the Belgrade library and museum. In 1925 he settled in Brussels, where he gave the planks to Yuriy Mirolyubov, who was the first to study them seriously. Izenbek treated the planks very carefully, did not allow them to be taken out of his house and refused a suggestion by a professor of University of Brussels to hand them over for studying. Later this refusal to permit others to study these texts would lead people to suspect them as forgeries.

For fifteen years Mirolyubov restored, photographed, transcribed (as photographs proved to be unreadable) and finally translated the text. He managed to transcribe most of the planks.

In August 1941 Nazi Germany occupied Brussels, Izenbek died and the planks were lost. Mirolyubov emigrated to the United States and passed the materials in 1953 to professor A. A. Kurenkov (Kur) who then published them in the magazine &quot;Zhar-Ptitsa&quot; (Жар-птица, &quot;Firebird&quot;) from March 1957 until May 1959. Later the text was studied by Sergey Paramonov (Lesnoy).

===Planks===

The planks were alleged to be 38 cm wide, 22 cm in height and about 0.5 cm thick. The edges and surfaces of the planks are uneven and near the top there are two holes for joining the planks. The text is carved into the planks and later covered with some coloring. Text alignment lines (roughly straight and parallel) are drawn across the planks and the tops of letters are aligned with these lines. The text is written below the lines, rather than above. The size and shape of the letters are different, suggesting that more than one person wrote the text. Some planks were partially or mostly rotten.
===Contents===

According to the Book of Veles, in the 10th century BC (&quot;thirteen hundred years before Ermanaric&quot;), pre-Slavic tribes lived in the &quot;land of seven rivers beyond the sea&quot; (possibly corresponding to Semirechye, southeastern Kazakhstan). The book describes the migration of the Slavs through Syria and eventually into the Carpathian mountains, during the course of which they were briefly enslaved by the king &quot;Nabsur&quot; (Nabonassar?). They settled in the Carpathian Mountains in the 5th century BC (&quot;fifteen hundred years before Dir&quot;). Several centuries appear to pass without much commotion. The 4th century is described in some detail: during this time the Slavs fought a number of wars with the Goths, Huns, Greeks, and Romans. Many references to Ermanaric and his relatives are present (placing this section of Book of Veles in the same historical context as the story of Jonakr&#x27;s sons, referenced in numerous European legends and sagas). The Slavs eventually emerged victorious. The period of the 5th to 9th centuries is described briefly; Khazars and Bulgars are mentioned.

The book ends with the Slavic lands descending into disarray and falling under Norman rule.

===Excerpts===

====Plank 2/B====
&quot;We were forced to retreat to woods and live as hunters and fishermen. So we could&quot;
&quot;get away from danger. We survived one darkness and started to build cities&quot;
&quot;and houses everywhere. After the second darkness there was great frost and we moved&quot;
&quot;to south for many places there were grassy ... and then Romei were taking our cattle&quot;
&quot;at a good price and were true to their word. We went&quot;
&quot;to southern ... greengrassland and had a lot of cattle ...&quot;
====From Plank 7/A====
&quot;Enemies are not as numerous as we are, for we are Rus&#x27; and they are not.&quot;
====Plank 11/A====
&quot;We pray and bow to the first Triglav and to him we sing a great glory.&quot;
&quot;We praise Svarog, grandfather of gods who is to whole gods&#x27; kin forefather&quot;
&quot;and creator of everything living, eternal spring that flows in the summer&quot;
&quot;and everywhere and in winter and never it freezes. And with that living water he nourishes&quot;
&quot;and life gives to us until we reach the blessed fields of paradise. And to god Perun, the thunderer, god of battle and fight we say:&quot;
&quot;&quot;You hold us in life by neverending turning of the circle and lead to path&quot;
&quot;of Prav through battles to Great Trizna&quot;. And all who got killed in the battle -&quot;
&quot;may they live forever in the Perun&#x27;s regiment. To god Svetovid glory we&quot;
&quot;are exalting for he is the god of Prav and Jav and to him we sing the song for he is the light&quot;
&quot;with which we see the world. We are looking and in Jav we are, and he from Nav&quot;
&quot;guards us and therefore praise we sing him. We sing and dance to him and call&quot;
&quot;god of ours to Earth, Sun and stars constantly in light keeps.&quot;
&quot;And glory all to Svetovid, god of ours that&quot;
&quot;hearts ours opens for us to admit bad deeds ours&quot;
&quot;and to good we turn. May he hug us like children for this has been said:&quot;
&quot;what is created with half of the mind could not be seen,&quot;
&quot;for it is a great secret how can Svarog be at the same time both Perun and Svetovid.&quot;
&quot;Two beings in skies Belobog and Crnobog are&quot;
&quot;And both of them Svarog holds and commands them.&quot;
&quot;After them come Hors, Veles and Stribog and then Visenj, Lelj and Letic.&quot;
====From Plank 26/B====
&quot;...As time passes, we come to the blue river as time ours&quot;
&quot;is not endless. There we meet&quot;
&quot;forefathers our and mothers that in Svarga herds are grazing and trusses&quot;
&quot;fastening. Their life is just as ours, only there are no Huns nor&quot;
Greeks...&quot;
====From Plank 16 (sample text)====

&quot;This book of Veles we dedicate to our god, in whom is [our] refuge and [our] strength. In those years there was a man, who was good and valiant, and [he] was called the father of Tiverians.&quot;
==Influence==
===Soviet era===
The Book of Veles is used as a source for various pseudo-historical ideas; a large number of fake publications are based on it - works in which the fake is considered by the authors of these works as a reliable source. Large-scale production and active dissemination of counterfeits and their propaganda and advertising in the media introduce scientifically designed false information into the public consciousness. Such pseudo-historical ideas also influence the educational and research process through secondary, secondary specialized, and higher educational institutions and the scientific environment by issuing educational and methodological literature, which includes the Book of Veles without scientific commentary or recommends it for study as a historical monument. Secondary education is most susceptible to the expansion of this falsified information due to the lack of a unified school curriculum. In particular, there is a replacement of textbooks and teaching aids for fake publications.

The Book of Veles is mentioned in the 1971 program article &quot;Vityazi&quot; by the Soviet poet Igor Kobzev, who was fond of Russian paganism and contrasted it with Christianity, which allegedly caused irreparable harm to the original Russian culture. The article was directed against the distortions of the Russian language and Russian history by some ill-wishers, while, according to Kobzev, &quot;the Russian people, like the Russian language, have infinitely deep roots that go back to the foggiest distances of millennia.&quot; In 1977, Kobzev demanded the publication of the texts of the Book of Veles and, in 1982, published poetic &quot;translations&quot; of its passages.

The controversy in the USSR around the Book of Veles began with an article by neo-pagan authors Valery Skurlatov and N. Nikolayev, published in 1976 in the popular weekly newspaper &quot;Nedelya&quot;. These authors argued that the work allegedly represents a &quot;mysterious chronicle,&quot; allowing a fresh look at the time of the emergence of Slavic writing, revising scientific ideas about ethnogenesis, the level of social development, and the mythology of the Slavs. Also in 1976, &quot;Nedelya&quot; published rave reviews about the Book, including accusations against persons who allegedly sought to &quot;dismiss&quot; readers and writers from an outstanding work by silence.

Ideas from the Book, such as Prav-Yav-Nav, were used by one of the founders of Russian neo-paganism, Valery Yemelyanov (neo-pagan name - Velemir). In 1967, Emelyanov defended his Ph.D. thesis at the Higher Party School. A good knowledge of the Arabic language and the peculiarities of the service allowed him to get extensive contacts in the Arab world, including the most senior officials. From these sources, he drew his understanding of &quot;Zionism.&quot; In the 1970s, Yemelyanov wrote the book &quot;Dezionization&quot;, first published in 1979 in Arabic in Syria in the &quot;Al-Baʽath&quot; newspaper at the behest of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. &quot;Dezionization&quot; tells of the ancient civilization of the &quot;Aryans-Veneti,&quot; the only autochthons of Europe, who lived in harmony with nature and created the first alphabet but were defeated by the Jews-&quot;Zionists&quot;, hybrids of criminals of different races, created by Egyptian and Mesopotamian priests. Since then, the world has been doomed to the eternal struggle of two forces - nationalist patriots and &quot;Talmudic Zionists&quot;.

According to Yemelyanov, a powerful tool in the hands of &quot;Zionism&quot; is Christianity, allegedly created by the Jews specifically to enslave other peoples. Many of Yemelyanov&#x27;s ideas have become widespread in Slavic neo-paganism and the Russian far-right environment. Some of Yemelyanov&#x27;s ideas from &quot;Dezionization&quot; were directly borrowed by the writer Yuri Sergeev. Under the influence of Yemelyanov, several marker terms entered the fantastic and parascientific literature about the ancient Slavs, the mention of which indicates to those in the know that they are talking about a specific ideology but allows them to avoid accusations of antisemitism or racism: &quot;Scorched camp&quot; (Palestine); &quot;Siyan Mountain&quot; (Zion); &quot;Rusa Salem&quot; (Jerusalem); steppe ancestors who traveled throughout Eurasia in ancient times; Khazaria as a parasitic state (Khazar myth), etc.

The writer Yuri Sergeyev proposed publishing the Book of Veles in the USSR, which caused a public discussion about this text in the autumn-winter of 1987-1988 on the pages of the weekly journal &quot;Book Review&quot;. In response, the philologist Nikolai Bogomolov (1987) explained the reasons for the inappropriateness of promoting a fake text and showed the complexity of studying Slavic mythology and the need for its critical scientific analysis. An interview was published with the linguist Lidiya Zhukovskaya (1988), who, in a popular form, outlined the arguments for the falseness of the Book of Veles.

===Post-Soviet era===
The Book of Veles continues to attract a wide readership. The growth of its popularity was observed in the 1990s - early 2000s. In the 1990s, the Book of Veles became popular in fantasy fiction.

Many neopagans consider the Book a sacred text on the history and religion of the ancient Slavs. Slavic neopaganism (rodnovery) borrowed the pantheon, the presentation of history, and pan-Slavic ideas from the Book of Veles. It is widely used as a historical source and a source of religious teaching in Slavic neopaganism and by representatives of some other new religious movements, including being the primary source of the doctrine of &quot;Prav-Yav-Nav,&quot; which was developed in Slavic neopaganism. The Book of Veles tells about the philanthropy of the Slavic pagan religion, which allegedly did not know of bloody sacrifices. Lesnoy and Mirolyubov especially emphasized this idea. Many neopagan movements have adopted it. Some native faith communities in Russia borrowed individual fragments of the text of the Book of Veles when conducting rituals.

The Book of Veles defends &quot;pagan values&quot; from advancing Christianity, tells about the struggle of the Slavs with countless enemies (Goths and Huns), and promotes the idea of the unity of the Slavs. For these reasons, it was taken by Russian nationalists as a rallying cry in the face of a supposedly hostile Western world. The Book of Veles became the basis for Russian and Ukrainian neopagan nationalism.

Since the early 1980s, those who doubt the authenticity of the Book of Veles have been accused of &quot;slandering Russian national history&quot; and &quot;hostility to everything Russian.&quot; Scientists who prove the falsity of the Book of Veles are accused of a lack of patriotism. Thus, Nikolai Slatin, a supporter of the authenticity of the Book of Veles and the author of his own &quot;translation,&quot; who shares the &quot;Hyperborean idea&quot; of Valery Dyomin, tried to refute the arguments of scientists, in particular, reproaching them for their lack of patriotism.

Valery Skurlatov and Valery Yemelyanov were the most prominent popularizers of the Book of Veles and were leaders of nationalist movements, with Yemelyanov being one of the founders of Russian neopaganism. Gennady Grinevich, an amateur epigraphist, wrote that this was a &quot;genuine book of the 9th century.&quot; The Book of Veles as an authentic Slavic and &quot;Aryan&quot; scripture is mentioned in the works of neopagan writers Sergei Alekseev (the novel series &quot;Treasures of the Valkyrie&quot;, since 1995), Yuri Sergeev (the novel &quot;Prince&#x27;s Island&quot;, 1995, where the &quot;Shine-Book&quot; is named in consonance), and others and influenced the ideas of these works.

The Ukrainian author Boris Yatsenko considered the Book of Veles proof that in the early Iron Age, if not earlier, &quot;one Slavic people, the Ukry,&quot; lived in Central Europe. The idea of the authenticity of the Book of Veles was shared by the famous artist Ilya Glazunov, who, on the whole, took traditional Orthodox positions but shared many ideas of Slavic neopaganism, including the &quot;Aryan&quot; idea.

In 1992, the neopagan writer Vladimir Shcherbakov published &quot;translations&quot; of some fragments of the Book of Veles. Shcherbakov presented himself as the first translator and researcher of this &quot;Slavic monument&quot; (which is not true). He considered the Book of Veles to be an authentic &quot;priest book of the Slavic-Russians&quot; (at first, he called it the &quot;Swan Book&quot;). He considered this text not as a work of the priests themselves, but as a revelation given from above, like the Judeo-Christian Bible: &quot;Representations about the world and its structure in the Swan Book are so deep that they undoubtedly reflect the divine truth, the revelation that was bestowed on the Slavs.&quot; In this text, he confirmed some of his ideas about the ancient area and the ways of settler &quot;proto-Europeans and Slavs.&quot; He did not mention that these ideas were influenced by Skurlatov&#x27;s earlier works, also based on the Book of Veles. Shcherbakov borrowed his all-encompassing teaching about the Mother of God from these works.

There are various versions of the translation of the Book of Veles into modern Russian, as a rule, performed by non-professionals who do not have a philological education and experience in translation. The most famous are the &quot;translations&quot; made by Alexander Asov, who published many pseudoscientific works on history and mythology connected with the Book of Veles. Asov is well known as a neopagan writer and ideologue.

In 1992, Asov published the book &quot;Russian Vedas. Songs of the bird Gamayun. Book of Veles&quot; in the publishing house of the journal &quot;Science and Religion&quot;, where he was the editor of the department of the history of Slavs. The publication contains the text of the Book of Veles, made by the &quot;Velesovitsa&quot; with the translation of Asov, in the imprint named by the sorcerer Bus Kresen. This publication, with a circulation of many thousands and mailing to all libraries, became an informational reason for the massive widespread emergence of Rodnovery.

In general, Asov&#x27;s editions of the Book of Veles, equipped with his &quot;translation&quot; and comments, have been published since the 1990s in large numbers. Some supporters of the authenticity of the Book of Veles (Boris Yatsenko) and supporters of the scientific point of view about the falsification of the work (Oleg Tvorogov, Anatoly Alekseyev) alike noted the arbitrariness of Asov’s interpretations in his &quot;translations,&quot; unspecified changes to the spelling and the text of the Book itself, incompetence in Slavic grammar, etc. According to authors of other &quot;translations&quot; of the Book and supporters of its authenticity (Gennady Karpunin, Dmitry Dudko, Nikolai Slatin), Asov’s &quot;translation&quot; contains errors, prejudice, and fantasy.

The version of the Book of Veles published by Asov in the 1990s was declared by him to be the only correct translation of Mirolyubov&#x27;s texts. However, in each new edition of the Asov translation (1994, 2000), this &quot;canonical&quot; text also changed. According to the historian Leo Klejn, Asov has created an entirely new Book of Veles.

Despite criticism, in most works of supporters of the authenticity of the Book of Veles, it is Asov&#x27;s &quot;translations&quot; that are quoted, and reasoning is built on their basis. Notably, the &quot;folklore&quot; ideas of Mirolyubov and Asov were used in the pseudo-historical publication &quot;Russian Khazaria. A new look at history&quot; in 2001, compiled by Yuri Petukhov, a writer close to neopaganism. The authors suspect professional researchers of inconsistency and unsuitability. The publications of Asov and his like-minded people in the journal &quot;Science and Religion&quot;, as well as the Book of Veles, served as the main historical sources of the Slavic-Aryan Vedas, the writings of the neopagan movement of the Ynglists (most likely written by the founder and head of the movement, Alexander Khinevich, in collaboration with others). Ynglists consider &quot;Old Russian Vedic writings&quot; to be sacred, among which they include the Book of Veles, or &quot;Russian Vedas&quot; (Asov&#x27;s version of the Book of Veles).

According to Asov, linguistic or historical arguments in assessing the authenticity of this text are secondary:
Based on the Book of Veles, Asov created the &quot;Slavic Russian (Slavonic) idea,&quot; according to which the original &quot;Vedic&quot; tradition, in his opinion, preserved in the Book of Veles, underlies most modern religions that have distorted this tradition. Asov considers Jesus Christ a descendant of Arius Osednya, the grandson of Dazhbog, mentioned in the Book of Veles (a variation of Aryan Christianity). According to Asov:
This messiah is Prince Ruskolani Husband Right Bus Beloyar (Old Bus). The cross is considered a &quot;Vedic&quot; symbol. Bus spread the &quot;Vedic faith&quot; along with the teaching of Prav-Yav-Nav (how to follow the &quot;Way of Rule&quot;). Asov claims that every 532 years (the period in terms of the number of years corresponds to the Christian great indiction, but specific great indictions are not connected with Asov&#x27;s chronology), a &quot;great Teacher of the World&quot; is born. Bus Beloyar was such a figure, who, according to Asov, was born on April 20, 295, then - Yagailo Gan (the figure &quot;Yagailo Gan smerd&quot; was invented by Alexander Sulakadzev), who compiled the Book of Veles (&quot;we have the right to recognize such a Teacher creator of the VK [Book of Veles]&quot;), a native of Poland, which is how Asov explains the Polonisms in her text (without explaining why Yagailo does not know Polish nasals well, inserting them out of place in the Book of Veles, and why Asov seeks to eliminate these Polonisms from the text). Asov wrote that Yagailo Gan was born in 791 (therefore, Bus and Yagailo are separated by 496 years, not the declared 532 years).

Asov wrote about the &quot;ancient wars of the people of the white and black races in Europe&quot; during the Late Paleolithic, the idea of which has a source in the esoteric concepts of anthropogenesis and corresponds to the idea of large-scale interracial wars defining the history, common in racist (including &quot;Aryan&quot;) discourse. According to Asov, &quot;it is necessary to awaken the dormant consciousness of the nation,&quot; and &quot;Russian Vedic culture should and can take a place in world culture no less honorable than Indian Vedic culture.&quot; He offers modern Russia to accept the &quot;Slavic-Aryan (Vedic)&quot; idea nationally.

Asov distances himself from ultranationalists and fascists but supports speeches against &quot;international Zionism.&quot; Asov uses occult ideas about the change from the &quot;fierce age of Pisces&quot; to the &quot;happy age of Aquarius.&quot; He associates the constellation of Pisces with Israel and Christianity and the constellation of Aquarius with Russia. The omnipotence of evil and the treacherous Chernobog (&quot;Prince of this World&quot;) are also associated with Israel and Christianity. The works of Asov or the ideas drawn from them are popular among some of the Rodnovers, who create their teachings on their basis.

Without real scientific arguments, Asov sharply criticizes Oleg Tvorogov and other scientists who deny the authenticity of the Book of Veles. He completely rejects the competence of Tvorogov (Tvorogov was the most prominent researcher and publisher of monuments of ancient Russian literature).

In the 1990s, there were heated debates among Russian Rodnovers about the authenticity of the Book and the possibility of its use in rituals. In the 2010s, their attitude towards this work became calmer. The St. Petersburg Union of Veneti, focusing on the translations of the Book of Veles made by Ukrainian Canadian emigrants, preferred the interpretations of one of the founders of Ukrainian and Slavic neopaganism, Professor Volodymyr Shayan, rather than Lev Silenko and the Ukrainian neopagan Native Ukrainian National Faith he created, which have more clear anti-Russian views. To date, among a significant part of the Rodnovers, the point of view prevails that, despite the falsity of the Book of Veles, its author conveyed some echoes of tradition.

Supporters of the authenticity of the Book of Veles are, in particular, the author of pseudo-historical ideas about the history of the Ukrainian people, Boris Yatsenko (magazine &quot;Chronicles 2000&quot;, No. 3-4, 1994; No. 1997); Doctor of Historical Sciences, a specialist in agrarian history and social and political processes of the modern history of Ukraine Petro Panchenko; and Doctor of Philology and researcher of ancient Russian literature Yury Begunov (&quot;Myths of the Ancient Slavs&quot;, Saratov, 1993), who in the 1990s spoke mainly with nationalist and conspiracy journalism. From the point of view of academician Andrey Zaliznyak, concerning these authors, &quot;we are actually talking about people who only admit some doubt about the falsity of the Veles Book, and do not directly and reasonably defend the version of its authenticity.&quot;

One of the first publishers of the Book of Veles, biologist Sergey Paramonov (Sergey Lesnoy), wrote:

Most supporters of the authenticity of the Book of Veles attribute it to the 8th-9th centuries and believe that Mirolyubov had access to the original of this time directly.

Boris Yatsenko took a peculiar position. He attributed the creation of the Book of Veles to the end of the 9th - the beginning of the 10th century, but, unlike most other supporters of the authenticity of this work, he believed that the protographer of the famous text of the Book of Veles was created not in Novgorod, but in Western Polesia, reflecting the dialect features of this region, later than the time to which supporters of authenticity usually date it, and the list (plates) that has come down to Mirolyubov belongs to the 17th century and was created by a Ukrainian. Yatsenko criticizes philologists Zhukovskaya and Tvorogov: Yatsenko explains the inconsistencies in the language of the Book of Veles noted by them with the complex history of its text and inclusions of different times.

Critics of Yatsenko’s version, Tvorogov and Zaliznyak, note that Yatsenko’s hypothesis about the history of the text of the Book of Veles does not clarify the unsystematic nature of morphology and syntax noted by critics (which is not characteristic of Slavic languages of any period), the formation of erroneous forms based on the model of different languages, absolute incompatibility with the grammar of Slavic texts of the 9th-17th centuries, and the unusual creation of copies of a pagan text in &quot;pre-Cyrillic writing&quot; on tablets in such an era as the 17th century. Anatoly Alekseyev notes that Yatsenko did not address grammar issues in his linguistic analysis. According to Alekseyev, Yatsenko&#x27;s work fulfills a &quot;national order&quot; in Ukraine since it was published at the expense of I. G. Kislyuk, whose biography, together with a portrait, completes the publication, and it is also reported that the philanthropist considers the Book of Veles &quot;sacred for our people&quot; and that &quot;Ivan Kislyuk and his like-minded people stubbornly spread national ideas and assets among the turbulent sea of low-quality foreigners.&quot;

Some supporters of the authenticity of the Book of Veles consider Mirolyubov&#x27;s readings, the language of which contains inconsistencies noted by scientists, as well as translations based on Mirolyubov&#x27;s text, as erroneous and consider it necessary to reconstruct a different text based on their interpretation of the Book of Veles. This particular opinion is shared by Yury Begunov, who supports the reconstruction and translation of A. I. Umnov-Denisov under the title &quot;Prinikaniye&quot; carried out in this direction.

The ethnographer and candidate of historical sciences Svetlana Zharnikova, who developed a pseudoscientific arctic hypothesis of the origin of the Indo-Europeans (&quot;Aryans&quot;), was a supporter of the authenticity of the Book of Veles. Under the influence of Zharnikova, the neopagan writer Sergei Alekseyev released the novel series &quot;Treasures of the Valkyrie&quot;. Zharnikova is presented in the novels as a woman who found the Book of Veles on the White Sea.

The satirist and popularizer of neopagan ideas Mikhail Zadornov, who also shared the idea of the origin of the Slavs from the &quot;Aryans&quot; (&quot;ancient Aryans&quot;), declared the total authenticity of the Book. Zadornov did not distinguish between the Book of Veles and Etruscan inscriptions, arguing that the Etruscans, who, in his opinion, were Russian, wrote &quot;on tablets.&quot;

The popular writer Yuri Nikitin, who reproduces in an artistic form the main ideas of Slavic neopaganism, uses the Book of Veles as one of the landmarks in history, from where he borrows ideas about the Slavs - the &quot;grandchildren of Dazhdbog&quot;, their nomadic lifestyle in the endless steppes, and their ancient book culture.

Some authors who develop the Ukrainian version of the &quot;Aryan&quot; idea consider the Book of Veles a genuine historical source. Nikolai Chmykhov, an archaeologist and doctor of historical sciences, considered it genuine. Vitaly Dovgich, a journalist and candidate of philological sciences, wrote that &quot;the history of Indo-Europe begins in Ukraine,&quot; one of the proofs of which, in his opinion, is the Book of Veles. In 1995, Dovgich assisted Boris Yatsenko in publishing the Book of Veles as a special issue of the &quot;Indo-Europe&quot; magazine (of which Dovgich is editor-in-chief). In this edition, Dovgych and Yatsenko argued that the Ukrainians descended from the ancient &quot;Ukry,&quot; who settled in deep primitiveness from the Elbe to the Dnieper and Danube.

Yuri Shilov, an archaeologist by education and a candidate of historical sciences, quoted the Book of Veles based on Asov&#x27;s translation and put forward his version of its origin: it &quot;could have been created by the descendants of the priests of the Veneti-Etruscans at the end of the 9th century, somewhere in the Crimea.&quot; In his opinion, the Book of Veles reports on the &quot;ancient civilization of Aratta,&quot; located on the territory of Ukraine and represented by the Tripillian culture. Following Shilov, Professor of the Precarpathian National University (Ivano-Frankivsk), philosopher L. T. Babiy argues that Ukraine is the ancestral home of the &quot;Aryans,&quot; &quot;the creators of the Tripillia archaeological culture with the states of Aratta and Ariana.&quot; He considers the Book of Veles to be the &quot;Ukrainian Bible&quot; and, at the same time, &quot;our Odyssey&quot;.

A well-known representative of the Russian nationalist movement, A. M. Ivanov (Skuratov), considered the Book of Veles to be a falsification. The neopagan ideologue Nikolai Speransky (Velimir) believes that Mirolyubov-Kura-Lesnoy&#x27;s Book of Veles and Asov&#x27;s Book of Veles were written not by the ancient wise men but by modern ones - he argues that this does not make them less interesting and less pagan, since it is important what they teach. In May 2012, three large native faith associations in Russia (Circle of Pagan Tradition, Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities, and Veles circle) recognized Asov&#x27;s and other authors&#x27; mythology and folklore as pseudoscientific and harmful to the &quot;Slavic faith.&quot; The Book of Veles was also firmly rejected by representatives of the Czech Rodnoverie Commonwealth &quot;Native Faith&quot;. Donat Gasanov from the Veles circle considers the Book of Veles a creation of Mirolyubov but admits that divine inspiration could have descended on the latter when writing the text.

In some cases, the publishers of the Book of Veles attribute to scientists an opinion about its authenticity. Among the purported supporters of the authenticity of this work was academician Boris Rybakov. Thus, Asov wrote that Rybakov changed his mind about the Book of Veles after the publication of articles by Yury Begunov and publications and translations of Asov himself. These claims are unsupported. Asov also noted that Rybakov spoke out in support of his research in an article in &quot;Science and Religion&quot; (1992). However, Rybakov&#x27;s cited note does not say anything about the authenticity of the Book of Veles.

Rybakov worked as part of a group of scientists from the USSR Academy of Sciences, which studied the issue of the Book&#x27;s authenticity and concluded that it was fake. Asov writes that Rybakov&#x27;s authorship in this publication was &quot;essentially falsified&quot; but leaves this claim without evidence. Rybakov did not share the idea of the authenticity of the Book of Veles even in the later period of his life: in a 1995 lecture, he calls it a fake of the 1950s, created by emigrants out of &quot;patriotic&quot; feelings and having no value; he named the only &quot;photo&quot; of the &quot;tablet of the Book of Veles&quot; as fake; Rybakov&#x27;s son, historian Rostislav Rybakov, in an interview for &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;, noted:

In 1997, Alexander Asov falsified the words of the historian Ivan Lyovochkin, who was critical of the Book of Veles: Asov cited Lyovochkin as a supporter of its authenticity.

Asov and neopagan author Valery Skurlatov, as well as O. Skurlatova and writer Yuri Petukhov (1990), attributed the belief in the authenticity of the Book of Veles to the archaeologist academician Artemiy Artsikhovsky (while Asov called Skurlatov &quot;a candidate of historical and philosophical sciences&quot;, which is not true). This statement has no basis. Tvorogov wrote about this:

Asov also refers to a personal conversation with Rybakov but claims that he told him otherwise. Dmitry Loginov (a supporter of the authenticity of the Book of Veles) wrote:

===Translations===
The following are publications that are claimed to be &quot;translations&quot; but have not been verified in scientific literature. According to Oleg Tvorogov and Igor Danilevsky, the unsystematic and arbitrary nature of the language of the Book of Veles makes it impossible to translate this work.

<text>Michel Petrucciani (; ; 28 December 1962 – 6 January 1999) was a French jazz pianist. From birth he had osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disease that causes brittle bones and, in his case, short stature. Despite his health condition and relatively short life, he became one of the most accomplished jazz pianists of his generation.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Michel Petrucciani&#x27;s family had Neapolitan heritage and lived in Montélimar, France, in the south of France. They were a musical family; his father, Tony, and his brother Philippe both played guitar, while his brother Louis played bass. Petrucciani was born in nearby Orange, Vaucluse having osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disease that causes brittle bones and, in his case, short stature. It is also often linked to pulmonary ailments. The disease caused his bones to fracture over 100 times before he reached adolescence and gave him pain throughout his entire life. In Michel&#x27;s early career, his father and brother occasionally carried him because he could not walk far on his own unaided. In certain respects he considered his disability an advantage, as it got rid of distractions like sports that other boys tended to become involved in.

At an early age, Michel saw Duke Ellington on television and wished to become a pianist like him. When Michel was four, his father bought him a toy piano of his own, but Michel smashed the piano with a toy hammer. Soon after this, Michel&#x27;s father bought him a real piano.

From the beginning, Petrucciani had always been musical, reportedly humming Wes Montgomery solos by the time he learned to speak. He began learning classical piano at the age of four, and was making music with his family by the age of nine. The musician who would prove most influential to Petrucciani was Bill Evans, who he started listening to at around age ten. Petrucciani&#x27;s layered harmonies, lyrical style, and articulation of melody would always be linked most strongly to his early exposure to Evans.

===Music career in Paris===
Petrucciani gave his first professional concert at the age of 13. At this age he was quite fragile and had to be carried to and from the piano. His hands were average in length, but his size meant that he required aids to reach the piano&#x27;s pedals.

Petrucciani felt he needed to move to Paris to begin his musical career, but found it difficult to leave home. His father was protective and constantly concerned for his son&#x27;s well-being, hoping to protect him from danger. Petrucciani&#x27;s drummer Aldo Romano took a less charitable view, thinking that Michel&#x27;s father was jealous and just wanted to keep Petrucciani at home to serve as his own musical partner. After some difficulty, Romano prevailed and took Petrucciani—at age fifteen—to Paris for the first time.

In Paris, Petrucciani started playing with Kenny Clarke in 1977 and Clark Terry in 1978. His breakthrough performance occurred at the Cliousclat jazz festival. Terry needed a pianist, and when Petrucciani was carried onto the stage and the trumpeter saw Petrucciani&#x27;s stature, at first he thought it was a prank, only later revising the remark. Indeed Petrucciani astounded the festival with his prodigious talent and virtuosity.

Drugs and encounters with unsavory women made Petrucciani&#x27;s time in Paris a mixed experience, but musically and personally it was unequivocally transforming. Despite his considerable talent, his clownish attitude and odd behaviors were seen as immature and insecure. He was foul-mouthed, wore a yachtsman&#x27;s cap and frequently acted pushy and tough, referring to people as &quot;baby&quot;. Nevertheless, his work in Kenny Clarke&#x27;s trio during his time in Paris set him on a clear path to stardom.

After his stint in Paris, Petrucciani briefly returned home before beginning his professional life. Living with his Romano, he was free of the protective presence of his father and began enjoying an independent lifestyle. He began recording for Owl Records and struck up a friendship with the company&#x27;s owner, Jean-Jacques Pussiau. Pussiau felt that Petrucciani always seemed to be in a hurry to record, which he attributed to Petrucciani&#x27;s own awareness that his life would be short. Before long, Petrucciani desired independence from Romano, too.

Petrucciani travelled to the U.S., possibly stopping in New York on the way. As was the case throughout his life, exact details were hard to pin down when it came to Petrucciani:

===With Charles Lloyd in New York===
In 1982, Petrucciani visited saxophonist Charles Lloyd in California. Lloyd had stopped playing when people began to view his sidemen as more fashionable than himself. After hearing Petrucciani play, Lloyd was so inspired that he agreed to come out of retirement and tour with him. Petrucciani and Lloyd&#x27;s tour of the West Coast of the United States was a huge success and they continued internationally. On 22 February 1985, with Petrucciani cradled in his arms, Lloyd walked onto the stage at Town Hall in New York City and sat him on his piano stool for what would be an historic evening in jazz history: the filming of &quot;One Night with Blue Note&quot;. The film&#x27;s director John Charles Jopson would later recall in the reissued liner notes that the moment moved him to tears.

Petrucciani and Lloyd&#x27;s performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival was made into an album, and in 1982, they won the 1982 Prix d&#x27;Excellence. But Petrucciani expressed mostly disdain and frustration at the awards he felt were being heaped upon him, believing that he was receiving so many at least in part because people believed he was going to die young.

Petrucciani moved to New York City in 1984 and spent the rest of his life there. This was the most productive period of his career. In 1986 he was recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival with Wayne Shorter and Jim Hall, producing the trio album &quot;Power of Three&quot;. He also played with diverse figures in the U.S. jazz scene including Dizzy Gillespie.

Throughout his career, Petrucciani also made a priority of recording solo piano:

==Personal life==
Petrucciani had five significant personal relationships: Erlinda Montano (marriage), Eugenia Morrison, Marie-Laure Roperch, the Italian pianist Gilda Buttà (the marriage lasted three months and ended in divorce) and Isabelle Mailé (with whom he shares his grave). With Marie-Laure he fathered a son, Alexandre, who inherited his genetic disorder. He also had a stepson named Rachid Roperch.

In 1994, he was granted the Order of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in Paris.

In the late 1990s, Petrucciani&#x27;s lifestyle became increasingly taxing. He was overworked, performing over 100 times per year, and in 1998, the year before he died, he performed 140 times. He became too weak to use crutches and had to resort to a wheelchair. He was also recording, doing television appearances, and constantly doing interviews. In his later years Petrucciani was known to drink heavily.
Petrucciani died from a pulmonary infection a week after his 36th birthday. He was interred in Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, one tomb away from Frédéric Chopin.

On 12 February 2009, the French music channel Mezzo broadcast a special event paying homage to Petrucciani close to the 10th anniversary of his death.

The first two American albums featuring Petrucciani were produced by Gabreal Franklin. The first, &quot;100 Hearts&quot;, a solo album, was produced at the famous RCA Studio A, on the Avenue of the Americas in New York City. The second was a trio album, recorded live at Max Gordon&#x27;s old Village Vanguard club in New York City. These were among the first albums to use digital recording technology, on Mitsubishi X80 recorders, so early on that the only manuals available were in Japanese; but Franklin and Tom Arrison managed to get them to function by trial and error.

In 1985 a concert at the Village Vanguard in New York was recorded on video.

==Personality and musical style==
Osteogenesis imperfecta seemed to contribute greatly both to Petrucciani&#x27;s personality and his playing style. By his own account, he was in almost constant physical pain. Yet, he was known for his cheerful, playful, even cavalier personality. He said, &quot;I love humor; I love to laugh, I love jokes, I love silliness. I love that; I think it&#x27;s great. I think laughter is worth a whole lot of medicine.&quot;

Though he often exhibited arrogance and even womanizing tendencies in his adolescent years, the defining characteristic of Petrucciani was his confidence. Michael Zwerin recalled one example: &quot;We were sitting there wondering what to play. It was kind of hot. And Michel said, &#x27;anybody know &quot;Giant Steps?&quot; Neither Louis nor I wanted to admit we didn&#x27;t really know it. So there was this great silence. And Michel said, &quot;Well, I do!&quot; and he pounded into a solo version of it at a very fast clip, and it was really amazing. That to me is Michel—&#x27;Well, I do!&#x27; Man, a confidence you wouldn&#x27;t believe.&quot;

Petrucciani had a quirky side; in a Mezzo documentary, he can be heard saying in a humorous voice, &quot;I am very short!&quot; Pussiau, the owner of Owl Records, recalled when he used to carry Michel for convenience. &quot;Sometimes, when I used to carry him, he would bite my ear. We&#x27;d walk into a restaurant, and he&#x27;d &quot;chomp&quot;.&quot;

During his last years in New York, it seemed Michel&#x27;s general attitude of carelessness was magnified. He said to his manager, &quot;I want to have at least five women at once, I want to make a million dollars in one night.&quot; In an interview, he said: &quot;My handicap is not mortal. I won&#x27;t die because of my handicap. It has nothing to do with that.&quot; He also said, &quot;Eventually, when I get to be 75, I&#x27;ll write a book on my deathbed.&quot; Yet other reliable sources assert that he was always aware of the potential effects of osteogenesis imperfecta.

Petrucciani was fiercely determined to take all the joy and satisfaction from life that he could. &quot;I&#x27;m a brat,&quot; he said. &quot;My philosophy is to have a really good time and never let anything stop me from doing what I want to do. It&#x27;s like driving a car, waiting for an accident. That&#x27;s no way to drive a car. If you have an accident, you have an accident—&quot;c&#x27;est la vie&quot;.&quot; He certainly lived true to his maxim. Just one week before he died of a pulmonary infection, he was up all night celebrating the new year with his friends.

Stylistically, Petrucciani is most frequently compared to Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett for his lyricism and Oscar Peterson for his virtuosity. His playing was often quite dramatic; critics accuse him of over-indulgence and cheap showmanship, sometimes dismissing his music as being too accessible. Petrucciani was loose and playful in a rhythm section, and gave attention to a strong articulation of the melody. He sometimes paused at the peaks of his solo lines before descending again, as if in appreciation of his idea.

Petrucciani distinguished himself most obviously from his primary inspiration in that he lacked Bill Evans&#x27;s cerebral approach to the piano. His interest was primarily in simply playing; he spent little time reharmonizing or arranging: Despite this emphasis on performance, he disliked applause, calling it old-fashioned and a distraction. Regarding &quot;mistakes&quot; that occur in improvised jazz, Petrucciani complained that the clarity with which he crafts his solo lines has the disadvantage of also exposing the former more clearly.

One fellow jazz giant summed up Michel Petrucciani&#x27;s essential character and style:

<doc id="313475" wikidata="Q268301" url="?curid=313475" title="List of censors of the Roman Republic">
<text>This list of [[Roman censor]]s includes all holders through to its subsumption under that of Roman emperor in 22BC.

Censors were elected by the Centuriate Assembly and served as a duo. Censors were elected to take an account of all citizens and their property value before performing a rite of religious purification. Roman taxes were levied based on the censors&#x27; account, and the censors could punitively tax citizens who failed to present at the census or falsely accounted for their property.

Whilst having no right to uphold law or command in war, the office of censor was the highest honour. Unlike the office of consul, which deteriorated over the Roman Republic period, most censors were men of exceptional standing and character. Censors were known also as &quot;castigatores&quot; () for their duty as the regulators of public morality. For instance, in 92 BC censors Domitius Ahenobarbus and Crassus condemned the teaching of rhetoric in Latin (as opposed to the customary Greek):

Initially, censors were chosen exclusively from among Roman citizens of patrician birth. after legislation – that he introduced while dictator – providing one censor of each two must be a plebeian.

== 5th century BC ==

Before 443 BC, the consuls were responsible for the census. In 443 BC, the right to take the census was moved from the consuls to the newly established office of censor. They were chosen exclusively from Patricians.

== 4th century BC ==

In 393 BC, Marcus Cornelius P.f. P. n. Maluginensis was elected suffect censor to replace the deceased censor Gaius Iulius Iullus. In 351 BC, Gaius Marcius Rutilus was elected as the first plebeian censor. According to the Lex Publilia, since 339 BC at least one of the censors had to be plebeian. In 312 BC, Appius Claudius Caecus was elected censor without being consul before.

== 3rd century BC ==

In 294 and 265 BC, Gaius Marcius Rutilus Censorinus was elected censor. This was the only time a person was elected censor twice. Marcius prevented this situation from repeating itself by originating a law stating that no one could be elected censor twice.

==2nd century BC==

In 131 BC, for the first time both censors were plebeian.

After only one year in office the in 109 BC elected censor Marcus Livius Drusus died. His colleague Marcus Aemilius Scaurus at first refused to resign but resigned when new censors were elected in 108 BC.

==1st century BC==

Lucius Marcius Philippus and Marcus Perperna were elected censors in 86 BC. Due to civil war and the consequences of Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship, no new censors were elected until 70 BC.

== After the Republic ==

With the solidification of Augustus&#x27; rule, the Roman Republic came to an end. The office of censor nominally continued a small way into the Roman Empire, for example in 14 AD when Caesar Augustus held the office with Tiberius Caesar.

<text>Alfred Domingo Herger (born November 4, 1942) is a Puerto Rican television show host and a psychologist. He has been labeled &quot;the Ed Sullivan of Puerto Rico&quot; in local media, due to his strong influence on Puerto Rican popular culture and his success as a television presenter.

==Early life==
Herger, of Spanish and German ancestry, was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico and was raised in San Juan. As early as in 1958, while he was a teenager, he would provide local newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; with hit rankings of the most popular songs among San Juan youth. He would eventually become a radio disc jockey, renowned for his sense of humor and affable character.

==Establishing &quot;Nueva Ola&quot;==
Herger was the originator and leader of the &quot;Nueva Ola&quot; music revolution of the 1960s in Puerto Rico. He became very famous across Puerto Rico with his daily television shows, which lasted until the late 1970s.

He helped the careers of many young singers of the time, such as, Chucho Avellanet, Lucecita Benítez, Sonia Noemí, Ednita Nazario, Lou Briel (Anexo 3), Zeny &amp; Zory, Carmita Jiménez, The Night Walkers, and others. He was also responsible for bringing into Puerto Rico various visiting artists, including Tony Croatto (with his sister Nelly) and &quot;Luisito Rey&quot;, the father of Latin American pop sensation Luis Miguel, who was born in Puerto Rico and for whom Herger was his godfather. He was a popular radio host during the mid- to late 1970s.

It was in the early 1970s that he befriended future &quot;Menudo&quot; creator Edgardo Díaz, who was working in Spain as manager of &quot;La Pandilla&quot;. Diaz contacted Herger about having &quot;La Pandilla&quot; go to Puerto Rico to make some recordings and be shown at Herger&#x27;s show, and Herger accepted. Herger became such a large propulsor of that group in Puerto Rico that he garnered the nickname &quot;The biggest Pandillero&quot; becoming their agent and producing a series of sold-out concerts in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. He also created a TV series with them and filmed two movies: &quot;Operacion Alacran&quot; and &quot;La Pandilla en Apuros&quot;.

Later on in 1980, Herger produced and hosted a game show, &quot;La Pirámide&quot;, complete with an Egyptian-themed set and imagery, tons of bad pyramid puns and jokes in the program&#x27;s scripts, and his entire family involved in the show. Herger&#x27;s oldest son Alfredo and daughter Grace Marie went on to be successful teen show hosts in Puerto Rico on WAPA-TV&#x27;s show &quot;Party Time&quot;. Grace Marie later became a part-time model and Alfredo attempted a career as a solo singer.

== Career as psychologist ==
Herger retired from radio and television to devote himself to his career as a psychologist during the mid 1990s. He had rebounded from depression after the murder of one of his children, Benny, in 1994. Benny was a minor player on &quot;La Pirámide&quot;, and later attended Purdue University in Indiana. Visiting Puerto Rico during one of his winter breaks he was carjacked and murdered. Herger was deeply affected by his son&#x27;s death but his inner search for sense from the whole experience gave him the motivation to complete a master&#x27;s degree and a Doctor of Philosophy degree. His constant interest in youth themes made him popular as a youth counselor.

Grace Marie&#x27;s first husband, physician Pedro Gracia Jr., suddenly died from an allergic reaction to shrimp at a dinner honoring him. This led some Puerto Ricans to believe that the Hergers were somehow cursed, in a way similar to that of the Kennedy Curse (some even blamed their stint producing &quot;La Pirámide&quot; and their irreverent treatment of Egyptian themes for their bad luck). Dismissing this as nonsense, Herger went on to produce self-help radio programs in which he was the host. He has since written four best selling books on self-help psychology since. Herger still exercises his profession as a psychologist at a private office in San Juan.

Adding to these tragedies, Herger&#x27;s other son, former television show host Alfredo Herger, died following a gym workout, on May 29, 2019 at the age 51. Reports says his death was caused by an Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Herger was honored by the&quot; Fundación Nacional para la Cultura Popular&quot;, which recognizes important figures of popular culture in Puerto Rico on August 13, 2008.

<text>Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus (c. 337 BC270 BC) was one of the two elected Roman consuls in 298 BC. He led the Roman army to victory against the Etruscans near Volterra. A member of the noble Roman family of Scipiones, he was the father of Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina and great-grandfather of Scipio Africanus.

==General of the third Samnite war==
Barbatus rose to preeminence as a patrician officer of the Roman Republic during the crucial period of the Third Samnite War, when Rome finally defeated a coalition of their neighbors: the Etruscans, the Umbrians, the Samnites, and their allies, the Gauls. The victory extended Rome&#x27;s leadership and sovereignty over most of Italy.

===Battle of Volterrae, 298 BC===
Prior to 298 BC war had already broken out between Rome and Etruria when the Etruscans decided to invade Rome in combination with some Gallic allies they had purchased. The planned attack was a violation of a former treaty with Rome. The Gauls reneged and the Etruscans found themselves facing a Roman army under consul Titus Manlius who however died after a fall from his horse in a display of horsemanship. The election held to replace him made Marcus Valerius Corvus consul. He joined the army in Etruria and began to waste the country hoping to provoke the Etruscans to battle, which they refused.

In 298 BC Appius Claudius followed by Publius Sulpicius became interreges for reasons unknown. Sulpicius held an election, which brought Barbatus and Gnaeus Fulvius Maximus Centumatus into consular office. The Lucanians spoke before the Senate saying that the Samnites were devastating their country and asking for the protection of Rome in exchange for a treaty and hostages. The Senate assented after a few moments&#x27; deliberation and dispatched heralds to tell the Samnites to withdraw. Encountering the Samnite army they were told that if they spoke in Samnium they would never leave there alive; consequently, the Senate declared war on Samnium. In a casting of lots as to which consul would take which war Barbatus won command of the army in Etruria while Centumatus undertook the initial campaign in the Third Samnite War.

The Etruscans attacked immediately before Volterra. A day-long battle brought no victory but in the night the Etruscans withdrew to their fortified cities leaving their camp and equipment to the Romans. Encamping his army at the Etrurian border Barbatus led a lightly armed force in the devastation of the countryside.

===Battle of Tifernum, 297 BC===
In the next year the Etruscans sued for peace. The newly elected consuls for 297 BC, Fabius Rullianus and Decius Mus led both armies against Samnium, Barbatus going as lieutenant general (legatus) under Maximus. As they advanced into Samnium laying waste to the country the Samnites were hoping to catch them in an ambush in a valley at Tifernum (Samniticum). Stationing a force there to entice the Romans they hid their main force in the hills behind. Fabius saw through the ruse and brought his army up in quadrangular formation before the &quot;hiding place&quot; of the Samnites, who then came down to fight a conventional battle, line-to-line.

Unable to obtain a victory, Fabius withdrew the spearmen of the First Legion from the line and sent them under the command of Barbatus stealthily around the enemy flank into the hills behind, whence the latter had earlier descended. They were ordered to coordinate an attack from behind with an especially vigorous cavalry charge to the front of the Samnite line. The plan went entirely wrong: the charge came too soon and was repulsed. A counterattack was beginning to break the Roman line when Barbatus&#x27; men appeared on the hills and were mistaken for the second Roman army under Mus, a disaster for the Samnites if true. They abandoned the field posthaste leaving behind 23 standards and 3400 slain, while 830 were taken prisoner. In fact Publius Decius Mus was far away in south Samnium.

===Campaigns under Claudius and Flamma, 296 BC===
Having routed the Samnite army both consuls proceeded to the systematic reduction of Samnium over a period of five months until the next election. Mus travelled over the country conducting operations from 45 camps successively while Maximus utilized 86. After elections the new consuls ordered them to continue the war in Samnium for six months, each with the rank of proconsul. The Samnite army under Gellius Egnatius, unable to remain in Samnium, offered its services to Etruria, which were accepted; under Egnatius&#x27; leadership the Umbrians were brought in and Gallic mercenaries were hired. Calling a meeting of all the chief men in Etruria Egnatius declared that war for freedom was better than peace with servitude and announced his intention to attack Rome. The Etruscans assented.

Receiving intelligence of the new dangerous circumstances the Senate dispatched Appius Claudius into Etruria in command of the First and Fourth Legions and 12,000 allied troops. Several inconclusive engagements were fought. The second consul for 296, Lucius Volumnius, was assisting the two proconsuls in the reduction of Samnium when the Lucanians defected, influenced by an appeal from the ordinary people of Samnium. Flamma claimed to have received a letter from Claudius asking for military assistance, a claim which was later denied by Claudius. Sending Maximus (presumably still with Barbatus) to the reduction of Lucania he departed for Etruria.

Claudius was ill-pleased to see him and had ordered him away when all the officers of his own army met to insist that he be retained. The men took a voice vote of such magnitude that it alarmed the nearby enemy camp and they prepared for battle. The Romans went out to fight immediately, with Claudius giving in to a situation he had to accept. The Romans attacked so fiercely with Claudius, it is said, fighting in the front ranks along with the men and continually invoking the goddess of war, Bellona, with hands upraised to heaven, that they routed the combined enemy force and drove them from their camp, killing 7300 and taking 2120 prisoners.

Meanwhile, the reduced forces of Maximus and Mus failed to restrain the Samnites, who raised another army with which they invaded and plundered Campania. Arriving there by forced marches Flamma learned that the Samnite army was encamped at the river Volturnus on its way back to Samnium. In the Battle of the Volturnus of 296 BC Flamma&#x27;s army waited in ambush outside the gates of the Samnite camp. Flamma had sent in native spies the night before, who ascertained that the Samnites would make a dawn march. At dawn Flamma allowed part of the Samnite army to march out, splitting their forces, before he launched an attack that had such a momentum it was soon being fought in the camp. 7400 Roman prisoners taken previously by the Samnites freed themselves and joined in the fighting. At the end of the day the Romans had killed 6,000, taken 2,500 prisoners including four military tribunes and the commander, Statius Minacius, and captured 30 standards. They redistributed the Samnite booty to claimants and gave the unclaimed property to the soldiers. Samnite hopes in the south had been thwarted.
News was received at Rome however that Gellius Egnatius had raised another army in the north consisting of Samnites, Etruscans, Umbrians and Gauls. The Senate, in a mood of despair, prepared to mobilize the last of the Roman forces. They ordered a draft of all males, including adolescents, the elderly and the sons of freedmen. For the first time they began to debate the permanent depopulation of Samnium (a measure that was never carried out).

===The turning point, 295 BC===
The elections of 295 BC were now upon the city. Flamma was recalled to conduct them. Maximus and Mus were elected, with Appius Claudius in the office of praetor. Maximus insisted on commanding in Etruria without the casting of lots that normally apportioned duties to consuls and after an intense public debate the Senate granted his request. He proceeded to Etruria, relieved Claudius of his command and sent him home on the grounds that he was a do-nothing commander who had allowed his men to sit in camp without even the exercise of marches for patrols and training. Thanks to Claudius, Maximus was soon recalled to account for his conduct of the Etrurian campaign and receive any further orders. Barbatus suddenly appears again in the account, indicating that he had been under Maximus&#x27; command all along. Maximus assigns Barbatus as propraetor of the Second Legion stationed temporarily at Clusium. He then departs for Rome.

==Patrician censor==
At the time of his death Barbatus was the patrician censor of 280 BC. His censorate is notable because it is the first one of which there is a reliable record, though the position was quite old by that time.

==Sarcophagus and Epitaph==
The Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus was discovered in the Tomb of the Scipios (the only one to survive complete there), and is now in the Vatican Museums. It preserves his epitaph, written in Old Latin Saturnian meter (for translation see article on Saturnian meter).

<text>Candice Patricia Bergen (born May 9, 1946) is an American actress. She won five Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for her portrayal of the title character on the CBS sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (1988–1998, 2018). She is also known for her role as Shirley Schmidt on the ABC drama &quot;Boston Legal&quot; (2005–2008). In films, Bergen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Starting Over&quot; (1979) and for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982).

Bergen began her career as a fashion model and appeared on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; before she made her screen debut in the film &quot;The Group&quot; (1966). She starred in &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966), &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; (1970), &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975). She made her Broadway debut in the 1984 play &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; and starred in the revivals of &quot;The Best Man&quot; (2012) and &quot;Love Letters&quot; (2014). From 2002 to 2004, she appeared in three episodes of the HBO series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. Her other film roles include &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000), &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002), &quot;The Women&quot; (2008), &quot;Bride Wars&quot; (2009), &quot;Book Club&quot; (2018) and &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
Candice Patricia Bergen was born May 9, 1946, at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles, California. Her mother, Frances Bergen (née Westerman), was a Powers model known professionally as Frances Westcott. Her father, Edgar Bergen, was a ventriloquist, comedian, and actor. Bergen&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants who anglicized their surname, which was originally Berggren (&quot;mountain branch&quot;).

Bergen was raised in Beverly Hills, California, and attended the Westlake School for Girls. As a child, she was irritated when described as &quot;Charlie McCarthy&#x27;s little sister&quot; (a reference to her father&#x27;s star dummy). She began appearing on her father&#x27;s radio program at a young age and in 1958, at age 11, was a guest with her father on Groucho Marx&#x27;s quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, as Candy Bergen. She said she wanted to be a clothing designer when she grew up.

She later attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she was elected Homecoming Queen and Miss University but, as Bergen later acknowledged, she did not take her education seriously. After failing two courses in art and opera, she was asked to leave at the end of her sophomore year. She ultimately received an honorary doctorate from Penn in May 1992.

Before taking up acting, Bergen was a fashion model and was featured on &quot;Vogue&quot; covers. She received acting training at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==
===Early work===
Bergen made her screen debut playing a university student in the ensemble film &quot;The Group&quot; (1966), directed by Sidney Lumet, who knew Bergen&#x27;s family. The film delicately touched on the subject of lesbianism and was a critical and financial success. Afterwards, Bergen left college to focus on her career. She played the role of Shirley Eckert, an assistant school teacher, in &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966) with Steve McQueen. The movie was nominated for several Academy Awards and was a financial success. It was made for 20th Century Fox.

She guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Coronet Blue&quot;, whose director Sam Wanamaker recommended her for the comedy &quot;The Day the Fish Came Out&quot; (1967) directed by Michael Cacoyannis, distributed by Fox. The film was a box-office flop, but Fox nevertheless signed her to a long-term contract.

===Films===
Bergen was announced for the role of Anne in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, but did not appear in the film.

Bergen went to France to appear in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Live for Life&quot; (1967) opposite Yves Montand, popular in France but not the US.

In 1968, she played the leading female role in &quot;The Magus&quot;, a British mystery film for Fox starring Michael Caine and Anthony Quinn that was almost universally ridiculed and was another major flop.

She played a frustrated socialite in a 1970 political satire, &quot;The Adventurers&quot;, based on a novel by Harold Robbins. Her salary was $200,000. The film received negative reviews, and while it did respectably at the box office, it did not help her career. Bergen called it a &quot;movie out of the 1940s.&quot;

Bergen played Elliott Gould&#x27;s girlfriend in &quot;Getting Straight&quot; (1970), a counterculture movie which drew another spate of bad reviews but was commercially profitable. She said it took her career in &quot;a new direction... my first experience with democratic, communal movie making.&quot;

She also starred in the controversial Western &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; (1970), an overseas success but a failure in America. The film&#x27;s European success led to Bergen&#x27;s being voted by British exhibitors as the seventh-most popular star at the British box office in 1971. Bergen appeared with Oliver Reed and Gene Hackman in &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (1971), a violent Western which drew terrible reviews and flopped.

Bergen received some strong reviews for her supporting role in &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971), directed by Mike Nichols. She then had the lead role in the drama &quot;T.R. Baskin&quot; (1971) and earned the best reviews of her career up to that time. She described the latter as the first role &quot;that is really sort of a vehicle, where I have to act and not just be a sort of decoration&quot; saying she had decided &quot;it was time for me to get serious about acting.&quot;

Bergen was absent from screens for a few years. She returned with a supporting part in a British heist film, &quot;11 Harrowhouse&quot; (1974), then did a Western with Gene Hackman and James Coburn, &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; (1975). Both films were modest successes. In 1975, she replaced Faye Dunaway at the last minute to co-star with Sean Connery in &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1976), as a strong-willed American widow kidnapped in the Moroccan desert. The film drew mixed reviews and broke even at the box office.

Bergen was reunited with Hackman in &quot;The Domino Principle&quot; (1977) for Stanley Kramer, another failure.

She appeared in &quot;A Night Full of Rain&quot; (1978) for Lina Wertmüller and was the love interest of Ryan O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s character in the &quot;Love Story&quot; sequel, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; (1978), but both films failed critically and financially.

Bergen appeared in the Burt Reynolds romantic comedy &quot;Starting Over&quot; (1979), for which she received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for best supporting actress.

She portrayed a best-selling author in &quot;Rich and Famous&quot; (1981) with Jacqueline Bisset. A remake of the Bette Davis film &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot;, it was not a success.

In 1982, Bergen appeared in the Oscar-winning film &quot;Gandhi&quot; in which she portrayed documentary photographer Margaret Bourke-White. Bergen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

=== Television and other work ===
Beginning in the 1970s, Bergen became a frequent guest host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She was the first woman to host the show, and the first host to do a second show. She was also the first woman to join the Five-Timers Club when she hosted for the fifth time in 1990. In recent years, Bergen has made various cameos on &quot;SNL&quot;, often to help welcome new members into the Five-Timers Club, such as Jonah Hill in 2018, John Mulaney in 2022, and Emma Stone in 2023. Bergen also guest-starred on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in its first season, while her father Edgar would guest-star the following season.

In 1984, Bergen joined the Broadway cast of &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;.

On television, Bergen appeared as Morgan Le Fay in &quot;Arthur the King&quot; (1985) and in the miniseries &quot;Hollywood Wives&quot; (1985). She was Burt Reynolds&#x27; romantic interest in &quot;Stick&quot; (1985), and for TV appeared in &quot;&quot; (1985) and &quot;Mayflower Madam&quot; (1987).

===&quot;Murphy Brown&quot;===
In 1988, she took the lead role in the sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, in which she played a tough television reporter. This provided her with the opportunity to show her little-seen comic talent. The series made frequent reference to politicians and political issues of the day; though it was primarily a conventional sitcom, the show tackled important issues. For example, Brown was a recovering alcoholic who became a single mother and later battled breast cancer.

In 1992, Vice President Dan Quayle criticized prime-time TV for showing the Murphy Brown character &quot;mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice.&quot; Quayle&#x27;s disparaging remarks were subsequently written into the show, with Brown shown watching Quayle&#x27;s speech in disbelief at his insensitivity and ignorance of the reality of the lives of single mothers. A subsequent episode explored the subject of family values within a diverse set of families. The Brown character arranges for a truckload of potatoes to be dumped in front of Quayle&#x27;s residence, an allusion to an infamous incident in which Quayle erroneously directed a school child to spell the word &quot;potato&quot; as &quot;potatoe&quot;.

In reality, Bergen agreed with at least some of Quayle&#x27;s observations, saying that while the particular remark was &quot;an arrogant and uninformed posture&quot;, as a whole, it was &quot;a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did.&quot;

Bergen&#x27;s run on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; was extremely successful. The show ran for ten seasons; between 1989 and 1998, Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times and won five. After her fifth win, she declined future nominations for the role.

===Post-&quot;Murphy Brown&quot;===

After playing the role of Murphy Brown, Bergen was offered a chance to work as a real-life journalist. After the show ended in 1998, CBS approached her to cover stories for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. She declined, saying she did not want to blur the lines between actor and journalist.

Subsequently, Bergen hosted &quot;Exhale with Candice Bergen&quot; on the Oxygen network. From 1991 to 1998, Bergen appeared as the main spokesperson for the Sprint long-distance phone company.

Bergen produced and starred in the TV movie &quot;Mary &amp; Tim&quot; (1996). She also appeared in films including &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000), where she played veteran pageant host Kathy Morningside; portrayed the mayor of New York in &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002); and appeared in the Gwyneth Paltrow flight-attendant comedy, &quot;View from the Top&quot; (2003).

She had roles in the remake of &quot;The In-Laws&quot; (2003), &quot;Footsteps&quot; (2003), a thriller, and appeared in three episodes of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and one episode in the sequel series &quot;And Just Like That...&quot; as Enid Frick, Carrie Bradshaw&#x27;s editor at &quot;Vogue&quot;. Bergen also appeared as Frick in a cameo for the 2008 movie version of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

===&quot;Boston Legal&quot; and beyond===
In January 2005, Bergen joined the cast of the television series &quot;Boston Legal&quot; as Shirley Schmidt, a founding partner in the law firm of Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt. The series reunited her with her &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; co-star William Shatner. She played the role for five seasons. In 2006 and 2008, she received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

She has also made guest appearances on many other TV shows, including &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (as herself playing Murphy Brown), &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (playing herself). She has also featured in a long-running &quot;Dime Lady&quot; ad campaign for the Sprint phone company.

Bergen could be seen in &quot;The Women&quot; (2008) and &quot;Bride Wars&quot; (2009) as Marion St. Claire, New York&#x27;s most sought-after wedding planner, who also serves as the narrator of the story.

From its launch in 2008, Bergen was a contributor for wowOwow.com, a website for women to talk culture, politics and gossip. The website closed in 2010.

She was in &quot;The Romantics&quot; (2010) and had an occasional role on &quot;House&quot; as Lisa Cuddy&#x27;s mother, starting in Season 7, including the episodes &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; and &quot;Family Practice&quot;.

In 2010, she appeared in a one-night only concert: a semi-staged reading of &quot;Evening Primrose&quot; by Stephen Sondheim. She also appeared on Broadway in the 2012 revival of Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot; and the 2014 revival of &quot;Love Letters&quot;.

Later performances included &quot;A Merry Friggin&#x27; Christmas&quot; (2014), &quot;Beautiful &amp; Twisted&quot; (2015), &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot; (2016),&quot;The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)&quot; (2017), &quot;Home Again&quot; (2017) and &quot;Book Club&quot; (2018).

===&quot;Murphy Brown&quot; reboot===
On January 24, 2018, it was announced that Bergen would be reprising her role as Murphy Brown. The reboot aired on CBS in fall 2018 for 13 episodes. On May 10, 2019, the reboot was canceled by CBS.

==Beyond acting==
In addition to acting, Bergen studied photography and worked as a photojournalist. She has written numerous articles and a play, as well as two memoirs, &quot;Knock Wood&quot; in 1984, and &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; in 2015.

In 2000, Bergen became the host of her own talk show called &quot;Exhale&quot; on Oxygen. Guests included Anne Bancroft and Diane Keaton. It ran for one season and was produced by Scott Carter, future producer of &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; with Bill Maher.

In 2016, Bergen began painting, with paint pens, on handbags, with the business overseen by her daughter, Chloé Malle, and with the proceeds benefiting charity.

==Personal life==

Bergen is a political activist who once accepted a date with Henry Kissinger. In 1967, she participated in a Yippie prank when she, Abbie Hoffman, and others threw dollar bills onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, leading to its temporary shutdown. In the late 1960s, Bergen was in a relationship with Doris Day&#x27;s son Terry Melcher. In 1972, she served as a fundraiser and organizer for George McGovern&#x27;s presidential campaign.

Bergen&#x27;s father died in 1978. In her memoir &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;, she mentions that she was left out of his will, while he bequeathed $10,000 to his dummy, Charlie McCarthy, adding that she felt her father had a stronger bond with Charlie than with her. She later said:

On September 27, 1980, she married French film director Louis Malle. They had one child, a daughter named Chloe Françoise, in 1985. The couple were married until Malle&#x27;s death from cancer on Thanksgiving Day in 1995.

She was married to New York real estate magnate and philanthropist Marshall Rose from 2000 to his death on February 15, 2025 from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Barbara Bach, Lady Starkey (&quot;née&quot; Goldbach; August 27, 1946,) is an American actress and former model. She played the Bond girl Anya Amasova in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. She is married to former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.

== Early life ==
Bach is a native of Rosedale, Queens and was raised Roman Catholic. She is of Jewish and Irish descent. She graduated from Dominican Commercial High School, an all-girls school, in 1964. The following year, she shortened her surname to Bach and began modeling professionally, appearing in catalogs and fashion magazines.

== Career ==
Bach was one of the most sought-after faces of the 1960s, working with the Eileen Ford Agency in New York, appearing on catalogs and the front covers of several international fashion magazines such as &quot;Seventeen&quot; (1965 and 1966), &quot;Vogue&quot; USA (July 1966) photographed by Richard Avedon, &quot;ELLE&quot; France (1966), &quot;Gioia&quot; Italy (1967–1970), and &quot;Figurino&quot; Brazil (1970).

Her acting career started in Italy, where she played Nausicaa in &quot;L&#x27;Odissea&quot; in 1968, an eight-hour long TV adaptation of Homer&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, directed by Franco Rossi and produced by Dino de Laurentiis.

In 1971, Bach co-starred with two other Bond girls, Claudine Auger and Barbara Bouchet, in the mystery &quot;Black Belly of the Tarantula&quot; (a giallo film) and appeared in other Italian films.

In 1977, Bach portrayed the Russian spy Anya Amasova in the James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Bach remarked after the film that Bond is &quot;a chauvinist pig who uses girls to shield him against bullets.&quot; The following year she appeared in the movie &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot;. She lost a role to actress Shelley Hack when she auditioned for season four of the television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. During an interview with Johnny Carson on May 9, 1979, she said that she lost the audition for &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; because they felt she was too sophisticated in attitude and look, and thought that she was not American, even though she was born in Rosedale and grew up in Jackson Heights, both in Queens, New York City. They asked her manager if she could play an American.

Bach has 28 films to her credit. She was featured in a pictorial in &quot;Playboy&quot; in January 1981. She also had a cameo in a September 1987 special issue on the Bond girls.

=== Charity work ===
In 1991, Bach co-founded the Self Help Addiction Recovery Program (SHARP) with Pattie Boyd, the former wife of George Harrison and Eric Clapton, both of whom assisted in the venture. Bach and Ringo Starr created The Lotus Foundation, a charity with many sub-charities.
== Personal life ==
Bach&#x27;s first marriage was to Italian businessman Augusto, Count Gregorini di Savignano di Romagna. The couple had two children together, daughter Francesca and son Gianni, before divorcing in 1975. Bach married British musician Ringo Starr, formerly of the Beatles, at Marylebone Town Hall on April 27, 1981. The two met in 1980, on the set of the film &quot;Caveman&quot; (1981).

Bach struggled with alcoholism and heavy drug use and, along with her husband, Ringo Starr, checked into a rehab in 1988 for four weeks. The couple have remained sober ever since.

According to the International Vegetarian Union, Bach and Starr practice vegetarianism.

She is fluent in Italian and has a working knowledge of French and Spanish.

<doc id="313515" wikidata="Q1312086" url="?curid=313515" title="Jacques Auguste de Thou">
<text>Jacques Auguste de Thou (sometimes known by the Latin version of his name Thuanus) (8 October 1553, Paris – 7 May 1617, Paris) was a French historian, book collector and president of the Parlement of Paris.

==Life==

Jacques Auguste de Thou was the grandson of , president of the Parlement of Paris (d. 1544), and the third son of Christophe de Thou (d. 1582), &quot;premier président&quot; of the same &quot;parlement&quot;, who had had ambitions to produce a history of France. His uncle was Nicolas de Thou, Bishop of Chartres (1573–1598). With this family background, he developed a love of literature, a firm but tolerant piety, and a loyalty to the Crown.

At seventeen, he began his studies in law, first at Orléans, later at Bourges, where he made the acquaintance of François Hotman, and finally at Valence, where he had Jacques Cujas for his teacher and Joseph Justus Scaliger as a friend. He was at first intended for the Church; he received the minor orders, and on the appointment of his uncle Nicolas to the episcopate succeeded him as a canon of Notre-Dame de Paris.

During the next ten years he seized every opportunity for profitable travel. In 1573 he accompanied Paul de Foix on an embassy, which enabled him to visit most of the Italian courts; he formed a friendship with Arnaud d&#x27;Ossat (afterwards Bishop of Rennes, bishop of Bayeux and a cardinal), who was secretary to the ambassador. In the following year he formed part of the brilliant cortege which brought King Henry III back to France, after his flight from his Polish kingdom. He also visited several parts of France, and at Bordeaux met Michel de Montaigne. On the death of his elder brother Jean (5 April 1579), who was &quot;maître des requêtes&quot; to the &quot;parlement&quot;, his relations prevailed on him to leave the Church, and he entered the parlement and got married (1588). In the same year he was appointed &quot;conseiller d&#x27;état&quot;. He served faithfully both Henry III and Henry IV, because they both represented legitimate authority.

He succeeded his uncle Augustin as &quot;président à mortier&quot; (1595), and used his authority in the interests of religious peace. He negotiated the Edict of Nantes with the Protestants, while in the name of the principles of the Gallican Church he opposed the recognition of the Council of Trent.

After the death of Henry IV, de Thou had a disappointment; the queen regent, Marie de Medici, refused him the position of &quot;premier président&quot; of the parlement, appointing him instead as a member of the &quot;Conseil des finances&quot; intended to take the place of Sully. This was to him a demotion; he continued, however, to serve under her, and took part in the negotiations of the treaties concluded at Ste Menehould (1614) and Loudun (1616). He died in Paris. 

===Personal life===
De Thou was married twice. His first wife was Marie Barbancon (1547-1601). His second wife was Gasparde de la Chastre, whom he married in 1602. Their son François Auguste de Thou was also a bibliophile. He was executed in 1642 after having been implicated in the rebellious conspiracy of Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars.

===Coat of arms===

Argent, a chevron between three flies sable.
The coats of arms displayed on his books vary, because during his marriages he amended the design to include the coat of arms of his wife.

==Works and library==

His attitude exposed him to the animosity of the League party and of the Holy See, and to their persecution when the first edition of his history appeared. This history was his life&#x27;s work. In a letter of 31 March 1611, addressed to the president Pierre Jeannin, he described his labours.

His materials were drawn from his rich library, one of the glories of Europe, which he established in the Rue des Poitevins in the year 1587, with the two brothers, Pierre Dupuy and Jacques Dupuy, as librarians. It was one of the finest libraries developed during the Renaissance era.

His object was to produce a scientific and unbiased work, and for this reason he wrote it in Latin, giving it as title &quot;Historia sui temporis&quot;. The first 18 books, embracing the period from 1545 to 1560, appeared in 1604 (1 vol. folio), and the work was at once attacked by those whom the author himself calls .

The second part, dealing with the first wars of religion (1560–1572) including the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, was put on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (9 November 1609). The third part (up to 1574), and the fourth (up to 1584), which appeared in 1607 and 1608, caused a similar outcry, in spite of de Thou&#x27;s efforts to remain just and impartial. He carried his scruples to the point of forbidding any translation of his book into French, because in the process there might, to use his own words, &quot;be committed great faults and errors against the intention of the author&quot;; this, however, did not prevent the Jesuit Father Machault from accusing him of being &quot;a false Catholic, and worse than an open heretic&quot; (1614); de Thou, we may say, was a member of the third order of St Francis. As an answer to his detractors, he wrote his &quot;Mémoires&quot;, which are a useful complement to the &quot;History of his own Times&quot;.

To de Thou we also owe certain other works: a treatise &quot;De re accipitraria&quot; (1784), a &quot;Life&quot;, in Latin, of Papyre Masson, some &quot;Poemata sacra&quot;, etc.

==Editions==

Three years after the death of de Thou, Pierre Dupuy and Nicolas Rigault brought out the first complete edition of the &quot;Historia sui temporis&quot;, comprising 138 books; they appended to it the &quot;Mémoires&quot;, also in Latin (1620). A hundred years later, Samuel Buckley published a critical edition, the material for which had been collected in France itself by Thomas Carte (1733). De Thou was treated as a classic, an honour which he deserved. His history is a model of exact research, drawn from the best sources, and presented in an elegant and animated style; unfortunately, even for the men of the Renaissance, Latin was a dead language; it was impossible for de Thou to find exact equivalents for technical terms of geography or of administration.

As the reasons which had led de Thou to forbid the translation of his monumental history disappeared with his death, there was soon a move to make it more accessible. It was translated first into German. A Protestant pastor, G Boule, who was afterwards converted to Catholicism, translated it into French, but could not find a publisher. The first translation printed was that of Pierre Du Ryer (1657), but it is incomplete.

In the following century the abbé Prévost, who was a conscientious collaborator with the Benedictines of Saint-Maur before he became the author of the more profane work &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, was in treaty with a Dutch publisher for a translation which was to consist of ten volumes; only the first volume appeared (1733). But competition, perhaps of an unfair character, sprang up. A group of translators, who had the good fortune of being able to avail themselves of Buckley&#x27;s fine edition, succeeded in bringing out all at the same time a translation in sixteen volumes (De Thou, &quot;Histoire universelle&quot;, Fr. trans. by Charles le Beau, Le Mascrier, the Abbé Des Fontaines, 1734). As to the &quot;Mémoires&quot; they had already been translated by Le Petit and Des Ifs (1711); in this form they have been reprinted in the collections of Petitot, Michaud and Buchon.

For his life may be consulted the recollections of him collected by the brothers Dupuy: &quot;Thuana, sive Excerpta ex ore J. A. Thuani per F.F.P.P.&quot;, Paris, 1669 (F.F.P.P.=Fratres Puteanos, i.e. the Dupuy brothers; reprinted in the edition of 1733), and the biographies by J. A. M. Collinson (&quot;The Life of Thuanus&quot;, London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, 1807), and Heinrich Düntzer, (&quot;Jacques Auguste de Thou&#x27;s Leben, Schriften und historische Kunst verglichen mit der der Alten&quot;, Darmstadt: Leske, 1837).

<text>Jean Dominique Antony Metzinger (; 24 June 1883 – 3 November 1956) was a major 20th-century French painter, theorist, writer, critic and poet, who along with Albert Gleizes wrote the first theoretical work on Cubism. His earliest works, from 1900 to 1904, were influenced by the neo-Impressionism of Georges Seurat and Henri-Edmond Cross. Between 1904 and 1907, Metzinger worked in the Divisionist and Fauvist styles with a strong Cézannian component, leading to some of the first proto-Cubist works.

From 1908, Metzinger experimented with the faceting of form, a style that would soon become known as Cubism. His early involvement in Cubism saw him both as an influential artist and an important theorist of the movement. The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points is treated, for the first time, in Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Note sur la Peinture&quot;, published in 1910. Before the emergence of Cubism, painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. Metzinger, for the first time, in &quot;Note sur la peinture&quot;, enunciated the interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote the first major treatise on Cubism in 1912, entitled &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;. Metzinger was a founding member of the Section d&#x27;Or group of artists.

Metzinger was at the center of Cubism both because of his participation and identification of the movement when it first emerged, because of his role as intermediary among the Bateau-Lavoir group and the Section d&#x27;Or Cubists, and above all because of his artistic personality. During the First World War, Metzinger furthered his role as a leading Cubist with his co-founding of the second phase of the movement, referred to as Crystal Cubism. He recognized the importance of mathematics in art, through a radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his wartime compositions. The establishing of the basis of this new perspective, and the principles upon which an essentially non-representational art could be built, led to &quot;La Peinture et ses lois (Painting and its Laws)&quot;, written by Albert Gleizes in 1922–23. As post-war reconstruction began, a series of exhibitions at Léonce Rosenberg&#x27;s Galerie de L&#x27;Effort Moderne were to highlight order and allegiance to the aesthetically pure. The collective phenomenon of Cubism—now in its advanced revisionist form—became part of a widely discussed development in French culture, with Metzinger at its helm. Crystal Cubism was the culmination of a continuous narrowing of scope in the name of a return to order; based upon the observation of the artist&#x27;s relation to nature, rather than on the nature of reality itself. In terms of the separation of culture and life, this period emerges as the most important in the history of Modernism.

For Metzinger, the classical vision had been an incomplete representation of real things, based on an incomplete set of laws, postulates and theorems. He believed the world was dynamic and changing in time, appearing different depending on the observer&#x27;s point of view. Each of these viewpoints were equally valid according to underlying symmetries inherent in nature. For inspiration, Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist and one of the founders of quantum mechanics, hung in his office a large painting by Metzinger, &quot;La Femme au Cheval&quot;, a conspicuous early example of &quot;mobile perspective&quot; implementation (also called simultaneity).

==Early life==

Jean Metzinger came from a prominent military family. His great-grandfather, Nicolas Metzinger (18 May 1769 – 1838), Captain in the 1st Horse Artillery Regiment, and Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, had served under Napoleon Bonaparte. A street in the Sixième arrondissement of Nantes (Rue Metzinger) was named after Jean&#x27;s grandfather, Charles Henri Metzinger (10 May 1814 – ?). Following the early death of his father, Eugène François Metzinger, Jean pursued interests in mathematics, music and painting, though his mother, a music professor by the name of Eugénie Louise Argoud, had ambitions of his becoming a medical doctor. Jean&#x27;s younger brother Maurice (born 24 Oct. 1885) became a musician, excelling as a cellist. By 1900 Metzinger was studying painting under Hippolyte Touront, a well-known portrait painter who taught an academic, conventional style of painting. Metzinger, however, was interested in the current trends in painting.

Metzinger sent three paintings to the Salon des Indépendants in 1903, and subsequently moved to Paris with the proceeds from their sale. From the age of 20, Metzinger supported himself as a professional painter. He exhibited regularly in Paris from 1903, participating in the first Salon d&#x27;Automne the same year and taking part in a group show with Raoul Dufy, Lejeune and Torent, from 19 January-22 February 1903 at the gallery run by Berthe Weill, with another show November 1903. 

Metzinger exhibited at Weill&#x27;s gallery 23 November-21 December 1905 and again 14 January-10 February 1907, with Robert Delaunay, in 1908 (6–31 January) with André Derain, Fernand Léger and Pablo Picasso, and 28 April-28 May 1910 with Derain, Georges Rouault and Kees van Dongen. He exhibited again at Weill&#x27;s gallery, 17 January-1 February 1913, March 1913, June 1914 and February 1921. It is at Berthe Weill&#x27;s that he met Max Jacob for the first time. Berthe Weill was the first Parisian art dealer to sell works of Picasso (1906). Along with Picasso and Metzinger, she promoted Matisse, Derain, Amedeo Modigliani and Maurice Utrillo.

In 1904 Metzinger exhibited six paintings in the Divisionist style at the Salon des Indépendants and the Salon d’Automne (where he showed regularly throughout the crucial years of Cubism).
In 1905 Metzinger exhibited eight paintings at Salon des Indépendants. In this exhibition Metzinger is directly associated with the artists soon to be known as Fauves: Camoin, Delaunay, Derain, van Dongen, Dufy, Friesz, Manguin, Marquet, Matisse, Valtat, Vlaminck and others. Matisse was in charge of the hanging committee, assisted by Metzinger, Bonnard, Camoin, Laprade Luce, Manguin, Marquet, Puy and Vallotton.

In 1906 Metzinger exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants. Once again he was elected member of the hanging committee, with Matisse, Signac and others. Again with the Fauves and associated artists, Metzinger exhibited at the 1906 Salon d&#x27;Automne, Paris. He exhibited six works at the 1907 Salon des Indépendants, followed by the presentation of two works at the 1907 Salon d&#x27;Automne.

In 1906 Metzinger met Albert Gleizes at the Salon des Indépendants, and visited his studio in Courbevoie several days later. In 1907, at Max Jacob&#x27;s room, Metzinger met Guillaume Krotowsky, who already signed his works Guillaume Apollinaire. In 1908 a poem by Metzinger, &quot;Parole sur la lune&quot;, was published in Guillaume Apollinaire&#x27;s &quot;La Poésie Symboliste&quot;.

From 21 December 1908 to 15 January 1909, Metzinger exhibited at the gallery of Wilhelm Uhde, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs (Paris) with Georges Braque, Sonia Delaunay, André Derain, Raoul Dufy, Auguste Herbin, Jules Pascin and Pablo Picasso.

1908 continued with the &quot;Salon de la Toison d&#x27;Or&quot;, Moscow. Metzinger exhibited five paintings with Braque, Derain, van Dongen, Friesz, Manguin, Marquet, Matisse, Puy, Valtat and others. At the 1909 Salon d’Automne Metzinger exhibited alongside Constantin Brâncuși, Henri Le Fauconnier and Fernand Léger.

Jean Metzinger married Lucie Soubiron in Paris on 30 December of the same year.

==Neo-Impressionism, Divisionism==

By 1903, Metzinger was a keen participant in the Neo-Impressionist revival led by Henri-Edmond Cross. By 1904–05, Metzinger began to favor the abstract qualities of larger brushstrokes and vivid colors. Following the lead of Seurat and Cross, he began incorporating a new geometry into his works that would free him from the confines of nature as much as any artwork executed in Europe to date. The departure from naturalism had only just begun. Metzinger, along with Derain, Delaunay, Matisse, between 1905 and 1910, helped revivify Neo-Impressionism, albeit in a highly altered form. In 1906 Metzinger had acquired enough prestige to be elected to the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants. He formed a close friendship at this time with Robert Delaunay, with whom he shared an exhibition at Berthe Weill early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by one critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like &#x27;cubes&#x27; to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.

Robert Herbert writes: &quot;Metzinger&#x27;s Neo-Impressionist period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay. At the Indépendants in 1905, his paintings were already regarded as in the Neo-Impressionist tradition by contemporary critics, and he apparently continued to paint in large mosaic strokes until some time in 1908. The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other (Art market, London, and Museum of Fine Arts Houston) in prominent rectangles of pigment. (In the sky of &quot;Coucher de soleil&quot;, 1906–1907, Collection Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller is the solar disk which Delaunay was later to make into a personal emblem.)&quot;

 The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger&#x27;s painting, and so too of Delaunay&#x27;s &quot;Paysage au disque&quot; (1906–1907), &quot;is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory...&quot;.

Jean Metzinger&#x27;s mosaic-like Divisionist technique had its parallel in literature; a characteristic of the alliance between Symbolist writers and Neo-Impressionist artists:

I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescences and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature. (Jean Metzinger, circa 1907)
Robert Herbert interprets Metzinger&#x27;s statement: &quot;What Metzinger meant is that each little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane whose mere size and direction are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement. This is only a degree beyond the preoccupations of Signac and Cross, but an important one. Writing in 1906, Louis Chassevent recognized the difference, and as Daniel Robbins pointed out in his Gleizes catalogue, used the word &quot;cube&quot; which later would be taken up by Louis Vauxcelles to baptize Cubism: &quot;M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically&quot;. The interesting history of the word &quot;cube&quot; goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing Cross&#x27;s work at the Indépendants in Art et Littérature, commented that he &quot;uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments.&quot;

Metzinger, followed closely by Delaunay—the two often painting together, 1906–07—developed a new sub-style that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Piet Mondrian, in the Netherlands, developed a similar mosaic-like Divisionist technique circa 1909. The Futurists later (1909–1916) would adapt the style, thanks to Gino Severini&#x27;s Parisian experience (from 1907 onward), into their dynamic paintings and sculpture.

In 1910 Gelett Burgess writes in &quot;The Wild Men of Paris&quot;: &quot;Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color.&quot;

&quot;Instead of copying Nature,&quot; Metzinger explained circa 1909, &quot;we create a milieu of our own, wherein our sentiment can work itself out through a juxtaposition of colors. It is hard to explain it, but it may perhaps be illustrated by analogy with literature and music. Your own Edgar Poe (he pronounced it ‘Ed Carpoe’) did not attempt to reproduce Nature realistically. Some phase of life suggested an emotion, as that of horror in ‘The Fall of the House of Ushur.’ That subjective idea he translated into art. He made a composition of it.&quot;

&quot;So, music does not attempt to imitate Nature’s sounds, but it does interpret and embody emotions awakened by Nature through a convention of its own, in a way to be aesthetically pleasing. In some such way, we, taking out hint from Nature, construct decoratively pleasing harmonies and symphonies of color expression of our sentiment.&quot; (Jean Metzinger, c. 1909, &quot;The Wild Men of Paris&quot;, 1910)

==Cubism==

By 1907 several avant-garde artists in Paris were reevaluating their own work in relation to that of Paul Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne&#x27;s paintings had been held at the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1904. Current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d&#x27;Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. Metzinger&#x27;s interest in the work of Cézanne suggests a means by which Metzinger made the transformation from Divisionism to Cubism. In 1908 Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir and exhibited with Georges Braque at Berthe Weill&#x27;s gallery. By 1908 Metzinger experimented with the fracturing of form, and soon thereafter with complex multiple views of the same subject.

A critic wrote of Metzinger&#x27;s work exhibited during the spring of 1909:

If M. J. Metzinger had really &quot;realized&quot; the &quot;Nude&quot; that we see at Madame Weill&#x27;s, and wished to demonstrate the value of his work, the schematic figure that he shows us would serve this demonstration. As such, it is a skeletal frame without its flesh; this is better than flesh without a skeletal frame: the spirit at least finds some security. But this excess of abstraction interests us much more than possesses us.

Metzinger&#x27;s early 1910 style had transited to a robust form of analytical Cubism.

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as &quot;ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.&quot;

In 1910 a group began to form which included Metzinger, Gleizes, Fernand Léger and Robert Delaunay, a longstanding friend and associate of Metzinger. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier&#x27;s studio on rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, near the boulevard du Montparnasse. Together with other young painters, the group wanted to emphasize a research into form, in opposition to the Divisionist, or Neo-Impressionist, emphasis on color. Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and Marie Laurencin were shown together in Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, which provoked the &#x27;involuntary scandal&#x27; out of which Cubism emerged and spread in Paris, in France and throughout the world. Laurencin was included at the suggestion of Guillaume Apollinaire who had become an enthusiastic supporter of the new group despite his earlier reservations. Both Metzinger and Gleizes were discontent with the conventional perspective, which they felt gave only a partial idea of a subject&#x27;s form as experienced in life. The idea that a subject could be seen in movement and from many different angles was born.

In Room 7 and 8 of the 1911 Salon d&#x27;Automne (1 October – 8 November) at the Grand Palais in Paris, hung works by Metzinger (&quot;Le goûter (Tea Time)&quot;), Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Albert Gleizes, Roger de La Fresnaye, André Lhote, Jacques Villon, Marcel Duchamp, František Kupka and Francis Picabia. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the second time. Apollinaire took Picasso to the opening of the exhibition in 1911 to see the cubist works in Room 7 and 8.

While Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque are generally acknowledged as the founders of the twentieth-century movement that became known as Cubism, it was Jean Metzinger, together with Albert Gleizes, that created the first major treatise on the new art-form, &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or held in October 1912. &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, published the same year by Eugène Figuière in Paris, represented the first theoretical interpretation, elucidation and justification of Cubism, and was endorsed by both Picasso and Braque. &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, which preceded Apollinaire&#x27;s well known essays, &quot;Les Peintres Cubistes&quot; (published 1913), emphasized the Platonic belief that the mind is the birthplace of the idea: &quot;to discern a form is to verify a pre-existing idea&quot;, and that &quot;The only error possible in art is imitation&quot; [&quot;La seule erreur possible en art, c&#x27;est l&#x27;imitation&quot;].

&quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; quickly gained popularity running through fifteen editions the same year and translated into several European languages including Russian and English (the following year).

In 1912 Metzinger was the leading figure in the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain at Galeries Dalmau, Barcelona, with Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, Marie Laurencin, and August Agero.

In 1913, Apollinaire wrote in &quot;Les Peintres Cubistes&quot;: In drawing, in composition, in the judiciousness of contrasted forms, Metzinger&#x27;s works have a style which sets them apart from, and perhaps even above most of the works of his contemporaries... It was then that Metzinger, joining Picasso and Braque, founded the Cubist City... There is nothing unrealized in the art of Metzinger, nothing which is not the fruit of a rigorous logic. A painting by Metzinger always contains its own explanation ... it is certainly the result of great hindmindedness and is something unique it seems to me, in the history of art. Apollinaire continues: The new structures he is composing are stripped of everything that was known before him... Each of his paintings contains a judgement of the universe, and his work is like the sky at night: when, cleared of the clouds, it trembles with lovely lights. There is nothing unrealized in Metzinger&#x27;s works: poetry ennobles their slightest details.
Jean Metzinger, through the intermediary of Max Jacob, met Apollinaire in 1907. Metzinger&#x27;s 1909–10 Portrait de Guillaume Apollinaire, is as important a work in the history of Cubism as it was in Apollinaire&#x27;s own life. In his &quot;Anecdotiques&quot; of 16 October 1911, the poet proudly states: &quot;I am honored to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Indépendants.&quot; So according to Apollinaire it was not only the first cubist portrait, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public.

Two works directly preceding Apollinaire&#x27;s portrait, &quot;Nu&quot; and &quot;Landscape&quot;, circa 1908 and 1909 respectively, indicate that Metzinger had already departed from Divisionism by 1908. Turning his attention fully towards the geometric abstraction of form, Metzinger allowed the viewer to reconstruct the original volume mentally and to imagine the object within space. His concerns for color that had assumed a primary role both as a decorative and expressive device before 1908 had given way to the primacy of form. But his monochromatic tonalities would last only until 1912, when both color and form would boldly combine to produce such works as &quot;Dancer in a Café&quot; (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo New York). &quot;The works of Jean Metzinger&quot; Apollinaire writes in 1912 &quot;have purity. His meditations take on beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach sublimity. The new structures he is composing are stripped of everything that was known before him.&quot;

As a resident of la Butte Montmartre in Paris, Metzinger entered the circle of Picasso and Braque (in 1908). &quot;It is to the credit of Jean Metzinger, at the time, to have been the first to recognize the commencement of the Cubist Movement as such&quot; writes S. E. Johnson, &quot;Metzinger&#x27;s portrait of Apollinaire, the poet of the Cubist Movement, was executed in 1909 and, as Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book &quot;The Cubist Painters&quot; (written in 1912 and published in 1913), Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.

===Crystal Cubism===

Metzinger&#x27;s evolution toward synthesis in 1914–15 has its origins in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a &quot;new perspective&quot; in accord with the &quot;laws of displacement&quot;. In the case of &quot;Le Fumeur&quot; Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in &quot;Au Vélodrome&quot;. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non-essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards &quot;Soldier at a Game of Chess&quot; (1914–15), and a host of works created after the artist&#x27;s demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as &quot;L&#x27;infirmière&quot; (&quot;The Nurse&quot;) location unknown, and &quot;Femme au miroir&quot;, private collection.

Before Maurice Raynal coined the term Crystal Cubism, one critic by the name of Aloës Duarvel, writing in &quot;L&#x27;Élan&quot;, referred to Metzinger&#x27;s entry exhibited at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune (28 December 1915 – 15 January 1916) as &#x27;jewellery&#x27; (&quot;joaillerie&quot;).

For Metzinger, the Crystal period was synonymous with a return to &quot;a simple, robust art&quot;. Crystal Cubism represented an opening up of possibilities. His belief was that technique should be simplified and that the &quot;trickery&quot; of chiaroscuro should be abandoned, along with the &quot;artifices of the palette&quot;. He felt the need to do without the &quot;multiplication of tints and detailing of forms without reason, by feeling&quot;:

Eventually all the Cubists (except for Gleizes, Delaunay and a handful of others) would return to some form of classicism at the end of World War I. Even so, the lessons of Cubism would not be forgotten.

Metzinger&#x27;s apparent departure from Cubism circa 1918 would leave open the &quot;spatial&quot; susceptibility to classical observation, but the &quot;form&quot; could only be grasped by the &quot;intelligence&quot; of the observer, something that escaped classical observation.
In a letter to Léonce Rosenberg (September 1920) Jean Metzinger wrote of a return to nature that appeared to him both constructive and not at all a renunciation of Cubism. His exhibition at l&#x27;Effort Moderne at the outset of 1921 was exclusively of landscapes: his formal vocabulary remained rhythmic, linear perspective was avoided. There was a motivation to unite the pictorial and the natural. Christopher Green writes: &quot;The willingness to adapt Cubist language to the look of nature was quickly to affect his figure painting too. From that exhibition of 1921 Metzinger continued to cultivate a style that was not only less obscure, but clearly took subject-matter as its starting point far more than an abstract play with flat pictorial elements.&quot; Green continues: Yet, style, in the sense of his own special way of handling form and color, remained for Metzinger the determining factor, something imposed on his subjects to give them their special pictorial character. His sweet, rich colour between 1921 and 1924 was unashamedly artificial, and is itself symptomatic of the fact that his return to lucid representation did not mean a return to nature approached naturalistically... Metzinger himself, writing in 1922 [published by Montparnasse] could claim quite confidently that this was not at all a betrayal of Cubism but a development within it. &#x27;I know works,&#x27; he said, &#x27;whose thoroughly classical appearance conveys the most personal [the most original] the newest conceptions... Now that certain Cubists have pushed their constructions so far as to take in clearly objective appearances, it has been declared that Cubism is dead [in fact] it approaches realization.&#x27;

The strict constructive ordering that had become so pronounced in Metzinger&#x27;s pre-1920 Cubist works continued throughout the subsequent decades, in the careful positioning of form, color, and in the way in which Metzinger delicately assimilates the union of figure and background, of light and shadow. This can be seen in many figures: From the division (in two) of the model&#x27;s features emerges a subtle profile view—resulting from a free and mobile perspective used by Metzinger to some extent as early as 1908 to constitute the image of a whole—one that includes the fourth dimension.

Both as a painter and theorist of the Cubist movement, Metzinger was at the forefront. It was too Metzinger&#x27;s role as a mediator between the general public, Picasso, Braque and other aspiring artists (such as Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) that places him directly at the center of Cubism. Daniel Robbins writes:
Jean Metzinger was at the center of Cubism, not only because of his role as intermediary among the orthodox Montmartre group and right bank or Passy Cubists, not only because of his great identification with the movement when it was recognized, but above all because of his artistic personality. His concerns were balanced; he was deliberately at the intersection of high intellectuality and the passing spectacle.

==Theory==

Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote with reference to non-Euclidean geometry in their 1912 manifesto, &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;. It was argued that Cubism itself was not based on any geometrical theory, but that non-Euclidean geometry corresponded better than classical, or Euclidean geometry, to what the Cubists were doing. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension with 3-space.

Though the rupture with the past seemed total, there was still within the avant-garde something of the past. Metzinger, for example, writes in a &quot;Pan&quot; article, two years before the publication of &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, that the greatest challenge to the modern artist is not to &#x27;cancel&#x27; tradition, but to accept &quot;it is in us,&quot; acquired by living. It was the combination of the past (himself inspired by Ingres and Seurat) with the present, and its progression into the future that most intrigued Metzinger. Observed was the tendency; a &quot;balance between the pursuit of the transient and the mania for the eternal. But the result would be an unstable equilibrium. The domination would no longer be of the external world. The progression was from the specific to the universal, from the special to the general, from the physical to the temporary, towards a complete synthesis of the whole—however unattainable—towards an &#x27;elemental common denominator&#x27; (to use the words of Daniel Robbins).
Whereas Cézanne had been influential to the development of Metzinger&#x27;s Cubism between 1908 and 1911, during its most expressionistic phase, the work of Seurat would once again attract attention from the Cubists and Futurists between 1911 and 1914, when flatter geometric structures were being produced. What the Cubists found attractive, according to Apollinaire, was the manner in which Seurat asserted an absolute &quot;scientific clarity of conception.&quot; The Cubists observed in his mathematical harmonies, geometric structuring of motion and form, the primacy of idea over nature (something the Symbolists had recognized). In their eyes, Seurat had &quot;taken a fundamental step toward Cubism by restoring intellect and order to art, after Impressionism had denied them&quot; (to use the words of Herbert). The &quot;Section d&#x27;Or&quot; group founded by some of the most prominent Cubists was in effect an homage to Seurat. Within the works by Seurat—of cafés, cabarets and concerts, of which the avant-garde were fond—the Cubists&#x27; discovered an underlying mathematical harmony: one that could easily be transformed into mobile, dynamical configurations.

The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points is treated in &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; (1912). It was also a central idea of Jean Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Note sur la Peinture&quot;, 1910; Indeed, prior to Cubism painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. And it was Jean Metzinger, for the first time in &quot;Note sur la peinture&quot; who enunciated the stimulating interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. In that article, Metzinger notes that Braque and Picasso &quot;discarded traditional perspective and granted themselves the liberty of moving around objects.&quot; This is the concept of &quot;mobile perspective&quot; that would tend towards the representation of the &quot;total image.&quot;
Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Note sur la peinture&quot; not only highlighted the works of Picasso and Braque, on the one hand, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay on the other, but it was also a tactical selection that highlighted the fact that only Metzinger himself was positioned to write about all four. Metzinger, uniquely, had been closely acquainted with the gallery cubists and the burgeoning salon cubists simultaneously.

Though the idea of moving around objects to capture several angles at the same time would shock the public they eventually came to accept it, as they came to accept the &#x27;atomist&#x27; representation of the universe as a multitude of dots consisting of primary colors. Just as each color is modified by its relation to adjacent colors within the context of Neo-Impressionist color theory, so too the object is modified by the geometric forms adjacent to it within the context of Cubism. The concept of &#x27;mobile perspective&#x27; is essentially an extension of a similar principle stated in Paul Signac&#x27;s &quot;D&#x27;Eugène Delacroix au néo-impressionisme&quot;, with respect to color. Only now, the idea is extended to deal with questions of form. (See Jean Metzinger, 1912, Dancer in a café).

Cubism by 1912 had abstracted almost to the point of total non-representation. In &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; Metzinger and Gleizes had realized that figurative aspects of the new art could be abandoned: &quot;we visit an exhibition to contemplate painting, not to enlarge our knowledge of geography, anatomy etc. [...] &#x27;Let the picture imitate nothing; let it nakedly present its motive, and we should indeed be ungrateful were we to deplore the absence of all those things – flowers or landscapes or faces – of which it could never have been anything other than a reflection&#x27;. Though Metzinger and Gleizes hesitate to do away with nature entirely: &#x27;Nevertheless, let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; as yet, at all events. An art cannot be raised all at once to the level of a pure effusion.&#x27; [...] &#x27;This is understood by the Cubist painters, who tirelessly study pictorial form and the space which it engenders&#x27;.
One of the essential arguments of &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, was that knowledge of the world is to be gained through &#x27;sensations&#x27; alone. Classical figurative painting offered only one point of view, a restrained &#x27;sensation&#x27; of the world, limited to the sensation of a motionless human being who sees only that which is in front of him from a single point in space frozen in a moment of time (time was absolute in the Newtonian sense and separate from the spatial dimensions). But the human being is mobile and dynamic, occupying both space and to time. The observer sees the world from a multitude of angles (not one unique angle) forming a continuum of sensations in constant evolution, i.e., events and natural phenomena are observed in a continuum of constant change. Just as the formulations of Euclidean geometry, classical perspective is only a &#x27;convention&#x27; (Henri Poincaré&#x27;s term), rendering the phenomena of nature more palpable, susceptible to thought and understandable. Yet these classical conventions obscured the truth of our sensations, and consequently, the truth of our own human nature was limited. The world was seen as an abstraction, as Ernst Mach implied. In this sense, it could be argued that classical painting, with its immobile perspective and Euclidean geometry, was an abstraction, not an accurate representation of the real world.

What made Cubism progressive and truly modern, according to Metzinger and Gleizes, was its new geometric armature; with that it broke free from the immobility of 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry and attained a dynamic representation of the 4-dimensional continuum in which we live, a better representation of reality, of life&#x27;s experience, something that could be grasped through the senses (not through the eye) and expressed onto a canvas.

In &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; Metzinger and Gleizes write that we can only know our &quot;sensations&quot;, not because they reject them as a means of inspiration. On the contrary, because understanding our sensations more deeply gave them the primary inspiration for their own work. Their attack on classical painting was leveled precisely because the sensations it offered were poor in comparison with the richness and diversity of the sensations offered by the natural world it wished to imitate. The reason classical painting fell short of its goal, according to Metzinger and Gleizes, is that it attempted to represent the real world as a moment in time, in the belief that it was 3-dimensional and geometrically Euclidean.

===Scientific aspects===

The question of whether the theoretical aspects of Cubism enunciated by Metzinger and Gleizes bore any relation to the development in science at the beginning of the twentieth century has been vigorously disputed by art critics, historians and scientists alike. Yet in &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes articulate: &quot;If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann&#x27;s theorems.&quot;

There was, after all, little to prevent the Cubists from developing their own pictorial variants on the topological space in parallel to (or independently of) relativistic considerations. Though the concept of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously (multiple or mobile perspective) developed by Metzinger and Gleizes was not derived directly from Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, it was certainly influenced in a similar way, through the work of Jules Henri Poincaré (particularly &quot;Science and Hypothesis&quot;), the French mathematician, theoretical physicist and philosopher of science, who made many fundamental contributions to algebraic topology, celestial mechanics, quantum theory and made an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity.

A multitude of analogies, similarities or parallels have been drawn over the decades between modern science and Cubism. But there has not always been agreement as to how the writings of Metzinger and Gleizes should be interpreted, with respect to &#x27;simultaneity&#x27; of multiple view-points.

Metzinger had already written in 1910 of &#x27;mobile perspective&#x27;, as an interpretation of what would soon be dubbed &quot;Cubism&quot; with respect to Picasso, Braque, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier (Metzinger, &quot;Note sur la peinture&quot;, &quot;Pan&quot;, Paris, Oct–Nov 1910). And Apollinaire would echo the same tune a year later regarding the observer&#x27;s state of motion. Mobile perspective was akin to &quot;cinematic&quot; movement around an object that consisted of a plastic truth compatible with reality by showing the spectator &quot;all its facets.&quot; Gleizes too, the same year, remarks, Metzinger is &quot;haunted by the desire to inscribe a total image [...] He will put down the greatest number of possible planes: to purely objective truth he wishes to add a new truth, born from what his intelligence permits him to know. Thus—and he said himself: to space he will join time. [...] he wishes to develop the visual field by multiplying it, to inscribe them all in the space of the same canvas: it is then that the cube will play a role, for Metzinger will utilize this means to reestablish the equilibrium that these audacious inscriptions will have momentarily broken.&quot;

Poincaré&#x27;s writings, unlike Einstein&#x27;s, were well known leading up to and during the crucial years of the Cubism (roughly between 1908 and 1914). Note that Poincaré&#x27;s widely read book, &quot;La Science et l&#x27;Hypothèse&quot;, was published in 1902 (by Flammarion).
The common denominator between the special relativistic notions—the lack an absolute reference frame, metric transformations of the Lorentzian type, the relativity of simultaneity, the incorporation of the time dimension with three spatial dimensions—and the Cubist idea of mobile perspective (observing the subject from several view-points simultaneously) published by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes was, in effect, a descendant from the work of Poincaré and others, at least from the theoretical standpoint. Whether the concept of mobile perspective accurately describes the work of Picasso and Braque (or other Cubists&#x27;) is certainly debatable. Undoubtedly though, both Metzinger and Gleizes implemented the theoretical principles derived in Du &quot;Cubisme&quot; onto canvas; something clearly visible in their works produced at the time.

Metzinger&#x27;s early interests in mathematics are documented. He was likely familiar with the works of Gauss, Riemann and Poincaré (and perhaps Galilean relativity) prior to the development of Cubism: something that reflects in his pre-1907 works. It was perhaps the French mathematician Maurice Princet who introduced the work of Poincaré, along with the concept of the fourth spatial dimension, to artists at the Bateau-Lavoir. He was a close associate of Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Jean Metzinger and Marcel Duchamp. Princet is known as &quot;le mathématicien du cubisme.&quot; Princet brought to attention of these artists a book entitled Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions by Esprit Jouffret (1903) a popularization of Poincaré&#x27;s &quot;Science and Hypothesis&quot;. In this book Jouffret described hypercubes and complex polyhedra in four dimensions projected onto a two-dimensional page. Princet became estranged from the group after his wife left him for André Derain. However, Princet would remain close to Metzinger and participate in meetings of the Section d&#x27;Or in Puteaux. He gave informal lectures to the artists, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order. In 1910, Metzinger said of him, &quot;[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry&quot;.

Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs (Le Cubisme était né):

Maurice Princet joined us often. Although quite young, thanks to his knowledge of mathematics he had an important job in an insurance company. But, beyond his profession, it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked n-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.
Louis Vauxcelles sarcastically dubbed Princet &quot;the father of cubism&quot;:
M. Princet has studied at length non-Euclidean geometry and the theorems of Riemann, of which Gleizes and Metzinger speak... Princet one day met M. Max Jacob and confided him one or two of his discoveries relating to the fourth dimension. M. Jacob informed the ingenious Picasso of it, and Picasso saw there a possibility of new ornamental schemes. Picasso explained his intentions to Apollinaire, who hastened to write them up in formularies and codify them. The thing spread and propagated. Cubism, the child of M. Princet, was born. (Vauxcelles, December 29, 1918).

In addition to mathematics, both human sensation and intelligence were important to Metzinger. It was lack of the latter human attribute that the principle theorists of Cubism were to reproach the Impressionists and Fauves, for whom sensation was the sole necessity. Intelligence had to work in harmony with sensation, thus together providing the building blocks for the Cubists construction. Metzinger, with his mathematical education and prowess had realized this relation early on. Indeed, the geometrization of space that would characterize Cubism can already be observed in his works as early as 1905, following the lead of Seurat and Cézanne. (See Jean Metzinger, 1905–1906, &quot;Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape&quot;, oil on canvas, 116 x 88.8 cm).

For Metzinger, along with to some extent both Gleizes and Malevich, the classical vision had been an incomplete representation of real things, based on an incomplete set of laws, postulates and theorems. It represented, quite simply, the belief that space is the only thing that separates two points. It was the belief in the geocentric reality of the observable world, unchanging and immobile. The Cubists had been delighted to discover that the world was in reality dynamic, changing in time, it appeared different depending on the point of view of the observer. And yet each one of these viewpoints were equally valid, there was no preferred reference frame, all reference frames were equal. This underlying symmetry inherent in nature, in fact, is the essence of Einstein&#x27;s relativity.

===Influence on quantum mechanics===

On the question as to whether creativity in the domain of science has ever been influenced by art, Arthur I. Miller, author of &quot;Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc&quot; (2002), answers: &quot;Cubism directly helped Niels Bohr discover the principle of complementarity in quantum theory, which says that something can be a particle and a wave at the same time, but it will always be measured to be either one or the other. In analytic cubism, artists tried to represent a scene from all possible viewpoints on one canvas. [...] How you view the painting, that’s the way it is. Bohr read the book by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes on cubist theory, &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;. It inspired him to postulate that the totality of an electron is both a particle and a wave, but when you observe it you pick out one particular viewpoint.&quot;

Niels Bohr (1885–1962), the Danish physicist and one of the principle founders of quantum mechanics, had hung in his office a large painting by Jean Metzinger, &quot;La Femme au Cheval&quot; (Woman with a horse) 1911–12 (now in the Statens Museum for Kunst, National Gallery of Denmark). This work is one of Metzinger&#x27;s most conspicuous early examples of &#x27;mobile perspective&#x27; implementation. Bohr&#x27;s interest in Cubism, according to Miller, was anchored in the writings of Metzinger. Arthur Miller concludes: &quot;If cubism is the result of the science in Art, the quantum theory is the result of art in science.&quot;

In the epistemological words of Bohr, 1929:

...depending upon our arbitrary point of view...we must, in general, be prepared to accept the fact that a complete elucidation of one and the same object may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. (Niels Bohr, 1929)

Within the context of Cubism, artists were forced into the position of re-evaluating the role of the observer. Classical linear and aerial perspective, uninterrupted surface transitions and chiaroscuro were pushed aside. What remained was a series of images obtained by the observer (the artist) in different frames of reference as the object was being painted. Essentially, observations became linked through a system of coordinate transformations. The result was Metzinger&#x27;s &#x27;total image&#x27; or a combination of successive images. In Metzinger&#x27;s theory, the artist and the object being observed became equivocally linked so that the results of any observation seemed to be determined, at least partially, by actual choices made by the artist. &quot;An object has not one absolute form; it has many,&quot; Metzinger wrote. Furthermore, part of the role of placing together various images was left to the observer (the one looking at the painting). The object represented, depending on how the observer perceives it, could have as many forms &quot;as there are planes in the region of perception.&quot; (Jean Metzinger, 1912)

==Exhibitions, students and later work==

On 19 June 1916 Metzinger signed a three-year contract (later renewed for 15 years) with the dealer, art collector and gallery owner Léonce Rosenberg. The agreement gave full rights for exhibitions and sales of Metzinger&#x27;s production to Rosenberg. The contract fixed the prices of Metzinger&#x27;s works bought by Rosenberg, who agreed to purchase a certain number of works (or a fixed value) every month. A contract between the two dated 1 January 1918 modified the first contract; the engagement was now renewable every two years, and prices of Metzinger&#x27;s works purchased by Rosenberg increased.

In 1923 Metzinger moved away from Cubism towards realism, while still retaining elements of his earlier Cubist style. In subsequent stages of his career another important change is noticeable, from 1924 to 1930: a development that paralleled the &#x27;mechanical world&#x27; of Fernand Léger. Throughout these years Metzinger continued to retain his own marked artistic individuality. These firmly constructed pictures are brightly colored and visually metaphoric, consisting of urban and still-life subject-matter, with clear references to science and technology. At the same time he was romantically involved with a young Greek woman, Suzanne Phocas. The two were married in 1929. After 1930, until his death in 1956, Metzinger turned towards a more classical or decorative approach to painting with elements of Surrealism, still concerned with questions of form, volume, dimension, relative position and relationship of figures, along with visible geometric properties of space. Metzinger was commissioned to paint a large mural, &quot;Mystique of Travel&quot;, which he executed for the &quot;Salle de Cinema&quot; in the railway pavilion of the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne, Paris 1937.

Jean Metzinger had been appointed to teach at the Académie de La Palette, in Paris, 1912, where Le Fauconnier served as director. Among his many students were Serge Charchoune, Jessica Dismorr, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Varvara Stepanova, Aristarkh Lentulov, Vera Efimovna Pestel and Lyubov Popova. In 1913 Metzinger taught at the Académie Arenius and Académie de la Grande Chaumière. He later moved to Bandol in Provence where he lived until 1943 and then returned to Paris where he was given a teaching post for three years at the Académie Frochot in 1950. In Paris, 1952, he taught New Zealand artist Louise Henderson, who became one of the leading Modernist painters in Auckland upon her return.

In 1913 Metzinger exhibited in New York City at the &quot;Exhibition of Cubist and Futurist Pictures&quot;, Boggs &amp; Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh. The show traveled to four other cities; Milwaukee, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, over the course of one year. The Milwaukee exhibition of Cubist works—including paintings by Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Marcel Duchamp and Jacques Villon—opened 11 May 1913. Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Man with a Pipe&quot; was reproduced on the cover of catalogue for the exhibition. Though he did not exhibit with his Cubist colleagues at the Armory Show of 1913, Metzinger contributed, through this exhibition and others, toward the integration of modern art into the United States.

During the spring of 1916 Metzinger participated in one of the largest exhibitions of modern art in New York City organized by Walter Pach and a group of European and American artists in New York; The Annual Exhibition of Modern Art, held at Bourgeois Gallery. Initially, some American exhibitors were offended by the &#x27;continental&#x27; nature of the show, but as Pack informed Matisse, &quot;the petty nationalism that had one had tried to throw inside had failed to advance, and I am certain of that&quot;. The exhibition included works by Cézanne, Matisse, Duchamp, Picasso, Seurat, Signac, van Gogh, Duchamp-Villon, in addition to works by Pach, the Italian-born American Futurist painter Joseph Stella, and other American artists.

Metzinger again exhibited in New york at the Bourgeois Gallery for the occasion of the 1917 and 1919 Annual Exhibition of Modern Art.
Further exhibitions: 6–31 January 1919 Metzinger had a solo exhibition at Léonce Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Galerie de L&#x27;Effort Moderne&quot;, and again 1–25 February 1921, in addition to participating in various group exhibitions. He would exhibit regularly at L&#x27;Effort Moderne throughout the 1920s. The same year he showed in New York with Jean Crotti, Marcel Duchamp, and Albert Gleizes at the Montross Gallery (where the Frenchmen became known as The Four Musketeers). Among his solo exhibitions were those at the Leicester Galleries in London in 1930, the Hanover Gallery in London in 1932, the Arts Club of Chicago in 1953 (for which he traveled to the United States on the transatlantic ocean liner Le Flandre) and International Galleries, Chicago, 1964. In 1985–1986, a retrospective of Metzinger&#x27;s works, &quot;Jean Metzinger in Retrospect&quot;, took place at The University of Iowa Museum of Art, and traveled to Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery University of Texas at Austin, The David Alfred Smart Gallery University of Chicago, and Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Metzinger, a sensitive and intelligent theoretician of Cubism, sought to communicate the principles of this movement through his paintings as well as his writings. (Lucy Flint, Peggy Guggenheim Collection)

Many exhibitions document the painter&#x27;s national and international success. His works can be found in private and public collections and institutions around the world.

The artist died in Paris on November 3, 1956.

==Legacy==
In the words of S.E. Johnson, an in-depth analysis of Metzinger&#x27;s Pre-Cubist period—his first artistic peak—&quot;can only class that painter, in spite of his youth, as being already one of the leading artistic personalities in that period directly preceding Cubism. [...] In an attempt to understand the importance of Jean Metzinger in Modern Art, we could limit ourselves to three considerations. Firstly, there is the often overlooked importance of Metzinger&#x27;s Divisionist Period of 1900–1908. Secondly, there is the role of Metzinger in the founding of the Cubist School. Thirdly, there is the consideration of Metzinger&#x27;s whole Cubist Period from 1909 to 1930. In taking into account these various factors, we can understand why Metzinger must be included among that small group of artists who have taken a part in the shaping of Art History in the first half of the Twentieth Century.&quot;

==Press articles==
==Catalogue raisonné==
The Jean Metzinger Catalogue Raisonné (or critical catalogue), researched and written by art historian Alexander Mittelmann, published by the nonprofit association &quot;Défense et promotion de l&#x27;œuvre de l&#x27;artiste Jean Metzinger&quot;, assembles and classifies the complete works of the artist (paintings, works on paper). It comprises historiography, documentation, and inventory, with bibliographic, iconographic commentary, technical and chronological analysis of Metzinger&#x27;s life and work. In addition to the catalogue raisonné, the forthcoming Jean Metzinger Monograph is set to be released in three volumes; the first in-depth study on the artist.

==Commemoration==
In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, the Musée de La Poste in Paris presents a show entitled &quot;Gleizes – Metzinger. Du cubisme et après&quot; from 9 May to 22 September 2012. Over 80 paintings and drawings, along with documents, films and 15 works by other members of the Section d&#x27;Or group (Villon, Duchamp-Villon, Kupka, Le Fauconnier, Lhote, La Fresnaye, Survage, Herbin, Marcoussis, Archipenko...) are included in the show. A catalogue in French and English accompanies the event. A French postage stamp is issued representing works by Metzinger (&quot;L&#x27;Oiseau bleu&quot;, 1912–13) and Gleizes (&quot;Le Chant de Guerre&quot;, 1915). This is the first major exhibition of works by Metzinger in Europe since his death in 1956, and it is the first time that a museum has organized an exhibit showcasing both Metzinger and Gleizes together.

==Art market==
On 6 November 2007, Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Paysage&quot;, c.1916–17, oil on canvas, 81.2 x 99.3 cm, sold for US$2.393 million at Christie&#x27;s, New York, Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale.

On 4 February 2020 the painting &quot;Le cycliste&quot; (1912) by Metzinger sold at Sotheby&#x27;s London for £3.015 (US$3.926 million). The sale represents a world record auction price for the artist. The oil on canvas with sand, measuring 100 x 81 cm, was purchased by a private American collector.

<text>Charles le Beau (18 October 1701, Paris – 13 March 1778, Paris) was a French historical writer.

He was born in Paris, and was educated at the Collège de Sainte-Barbe and the Collège du Plessis; at the latter he remained as a teacher until he obtained the chair of rhetoric in the Collège des Grassins. In 1748 he was admitted as a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, and in 1752 he was nominated professor of Latin eloquence at the Collège de France. From 1755 onward, he held the office of perpetual secretary to the Academy of Inscriptions, in which capacity he edited fifteen volumes (from the 25th to the 39th inclusive) of the &quot;Histoire&quot; of that institution.

He is best remembered as the author of &quot;Histoire du Bas-Empire, en commençant à Constantin le Grand&quot;, in 22 volumes (Paris, 1756–1779). This is a continuation of Charles Rollin&#x27;s &quot;Histoire Romaine&quot; and JBL Crevier&#x27;s &quot;Histoire des empereurs&quot;. Its usefulness arises entirely from the fact of its being a faithful resume of the Byzantine historians. Five volumes were added by H.-P. Ameilhon (1781–1811), which brought the work down to the fall of Constantinople. A later edition was produced by Antoine-Jean Saint-Martin and afterwards of Marie-Félicité Brosset.

== List of works ==
* &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;Académie royale des inscriptions et belles-lettres, avec les mémoires de littérature&quot;, Tome XXV à XXXIX, 1759-1777. 
* &quot;Histoire du Bas-Empire en commençant à Constantin le Grand&quot;, 27 volumes, 1757-1811 (five volumes being added by Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon).
* &quot;Opera latina : Carmina, Fabulae et narrationes, Orationes et oratiunculae&quot;, 3 volumes, 1782-1783.
* &quot;Parallèle curieux des fables en vers latins de M. Lebeau avec La Fontaine, et tous les poètes latins qui ont traité les mêmes fables&quot;, 1785 (with Jean de La Fontaine).

<text>Karl Gerhart &quot;Gert&quot; Fröbe (; 25 February 1913 – 5 September 1988) was a German actor. He was known in English-speaking countries for his work as the title character in the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, as Peachum in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, as Baron Bomburst in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, as Hotzenplotz in &quot;The Robber Hotzenplotz&quot;, General Dietrich von Choltitz in &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot;, as Colonel Manfred von Holstein in &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot;, and as Inspector Bauer in Ingmar Bergman’s The Serpent&#x27;s Egg. 

Fröbe was a three-time German Film Award nominee, twice for Best Leading Actor and once for Best Supporting Actor. In 1978, he won an honorary award for &quot;outstanding individual contributions to the German cinema over the years.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Fröbe was born in Oberplanitz, today part of Zwickau. He was initially a violinist, but he abandoned it for Kabarett and theatre work.

He joined the Nazi Party in 1929 at the age of 16 and left in 1937, before the outbreak of the Second World War. After his party membership became known after the war, Israel banned Fröbe&#x27;s films until Mario Blumenau, a Jewish survivor, revealed just eight weeks later that his life and his mother&#x27;s were probably saved when Fröbe hid them from the Nazis in his basement.

In September 1944, theatres in Germany were closed down and Fröbe was drafted into the German Army, where he served until the end of the war.

== Career ==
Fröbe gained fame in one of the first German films made after the War, called &quot;Berliner Ballade&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Berlin&quot;, 1948). His character&#x27;s name, &quot;Otto Normalverbraucher&quot; ( Otto Average Consumer), became the German term equivalent to &quot;Average Joe&quot;.

He was cast as the villain in the Swiss-West German-Spanish film &quot;Es geschah am hellichten Tag&quot; (&quot;It Happened in Broad Daylight&quot;, 1958), with the original screenplay written by Friedrich Dürrenmatt. His role as a serial killer of children drew the attention of the producers of the James Bond movie &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964) and he was chosen to play one of the best remembered villains of the series, gold tycoon Auric Goldfinger. He later remarked, &quot;The ridiculous thing is that since I played Goldfinger in the James Bond film there are some people who still insist on seeing me as a cold, ruthless villain – a man without laughs.&quot; 
Fröbe made several appearances in all-star casts in the 1960s, including the films &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965), &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966),&quot;Triple Cross&quot; (1966), &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), and &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust&quot; (1969).

During the 1980s, Fröbe was a spokesman in Mercedes Benz W123 commercials, helping to promote the coupé and the sedan.

== Death ==
Fröbe died in Munich in September 1988 at age 75 from a heart attack. He was buried at the Waldfriedhof cemetery in Icking.
