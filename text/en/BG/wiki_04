<text>The (; ) was the main military component of the French Imperial Army commanded by Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte during the Napoleonic Wars. From 1804 to 1808, it won a series of military victories that allowed the French Empire to exercise unprecedented control over most of Europe. Widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest fighting forces ever assembled, it suffered catastophic losses during the disastrous Peninsular War followed by the invasion of Russia in 1812, after which it never recovered its strategic superiority and ended in total defeat for Napoleonic France by the Peace of Paris in 1815.

The &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was formed in 1804 from &quot;L&#x27;Armée des côtes de l&#x27;Océan&quot; (The Army of the Ocean Coasts), a force of over 100,000 men that Napoleon had assembled for the proposed invasion of Britain. Napoleon later deployed the army in Central Europe to eliminate the combined threat of Austria and Russia, which were part of the Third Coalition formed against France. Thereafter, the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was the principal military force deployed in the campaigns of 1806/7, the French invasion of Spain, and in the War of the Fifth Coalition, where the French army slowly lost a large portion of its veteran soldiers, strength and prestige, and in the conflicts of 1812, 1813–14, and 1815. In practice, however, the term &quot;Grande Armée&quot; is used in English to refer to all the multinational forces gathered by Napoleon in his campaigns.

In addition to its size and multinational composition, the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was known in history for its innovative formations, tactics, logistics, and communications. While most contingents were commanded by French generals, except for the Polish and Austrian corps, soldiers could climb the ranks regardless of class, wealth, or national origin, unlike many of the other European armies at the time.

Upon its formation, the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; consisted of six corps under the command of Napoleon&#x27;s marshals and senior generals. When the Austrian and Russian armies began their preparations to invade France in late 1805, the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was quickly ordered across the Rhine into southern Germany, leading to Napoleon&#x27;s victories at Ulm and Austerlitz. The French Army grew as Napoleon seized power across Europe, recruiting troops from occupied and allied nations; it reached its peak of one million men at the start of the Russian campaign in 1812, with the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; reaching its height of 413,000 French soldiers and over 600,000 men overall when including foreign recruits.

In summer of 1812, as large of an amount as 300,000 French troops fought in the Peninsular War. Napoleon opened a second war front as the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; marched slowly east, and the Russians fell back with its approach. After the capture of Smolensk and victory at Borodino, the French reached Moscow on 14 September 1812. However, the army was already drastically reduced by skirmishes with the Russians, disease (principally typhus), desertion, heat, exhaustion, and long communication lines. The army spent a month in Moscow but was ultimately forced to march back westward. Cold, starvation, and disease, as well as constant harassment by Cossacks and Russian partisans, resulted in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; utter destruction as a fighting force. Only 120,000 men survived to leave Russia (excluding early deserters); of these, 50,000 were Austrians, Prussians, and other Germans, 20,000 were Poles, and just 35,000 were French. As many as 380,000 died in the campaign.

Napoleon led a new army during the campaign in Germany in 1813, the defense of France in 1814, and the Waterloo campaign in 1815, but the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; would never regain its height of June 1812, and France would find itself invaded on multiple fronts from the Spanish border to the German border. In total, from 1805 to 1813, over 2.1 million Frenchmen were conscripted into the French Imperial Army.

==History==
&quot;For a history of the French Army in the period of 1792–1804 during the wars of the First and Second Coalitions see French Revolutionary Army.&quot;

===1804–1806===
The &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was originally formed as &quot;L&#x27;Armée des côtes de l&#x27;Océan&quot; (Army of the Ocean Coasts) intended for the invasion of Britain, at the port of Boulogne in 1804. Following Napoleon&#x27;s coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804, the Third Coalition was formed against France and the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; turned its sights eastwards in 1805. The army left Boulogne in late August and through rapid marches, surrounded General Karl von Mack&#x27;s isolated Austrian Army at the fortress of Ulm. The Ulm campaign, as it came to be known, resulted in 60,000 Austrian prisoners at the cost of just 2,000 French soldiers. By November, Vienna was taken but Austria refused to capitulate, maintaining an army in the field. In addition, its ally Russia had yet to commit to action. The war would continue for a while longer. Affairs were decisively settled on 2 December 1805 at the Battle of Austerlitz, where the numerically inferior &quot;Grande Armée&quot; routed a combined Russo-Austrian army led by Russian Emperor Alexander I. The stunning victory led to the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire the following year.

The alarming increase of French power in Central Europe disturbed Prussia, which had remained neutral the previous year. After much diplomatic wrangling, Prussia secured promises of Russian military aid and the Fourth Coalition against France came into being in 1806. The &quot;Grande Armée&quot; advanced into Prussian territory with the famed &quot;bataillon-carré&quot; (battalion square) system, whereby corps marched in close supporting distances and became vanguards, rearguards, or flank forces as the situation demanded, and decisively defeated the Prussians at Jena and Auerstedt, both fought on 14 October 1806. After a legendary pursuit, the French took 140,000 prisoners and killed and wounded roughly 25,000. Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout&#x27;s III Corps, the victors at Auerstedt, received the honours of marching into Berlin first. Once more, the French had defeated an enemy before its allies could arrive, and once more, this did not bring peace.

===1807–1808===

Napoleon now turned his attentions to Poland, where the remaining Prussian armies were linking up with their Russian allies. A difficult winter campaign produced nothing but a stalemate, made worse by the Battle of Eylau on 7–8 February 1807, where Russian and French casualties soared for little gain. The campaign resumed in the spring and this time General Levin August von Bennigsen&#x27;s Russian army was soundly defeated at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807. This victory brought about the Treaties of Tilsit between France, Russia, and Prussia in July, leaving Napoleon with no enemies on the continent.

The &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was dissolved in October 1808 and its constituents formed into the Army of Spain and the Army of the Rhine, which in 1809 was reorganized into the Army of Germany.

===1810–1812===
With the exception of Spain, a three-year lull ensued. Diplomatic tensions with Russia, however, became so acute that they eventually led to war in 1812. Napoleon assembled the largest field army he had ever commanded to deal with this menace. On 24 June 1812, shortly before the invasion, the assembled troops with a total strength of 685,000 men were made up of:

• 410,000 from the French Empire (present-day France, Italy, the Low Countries, and several German states) • 95,000 Poles • 35,000 Austrians • 30,000 Italians • 24,000 Bavarians • 20,000 Saxons • 20,000 Prussians • 17,000 Westphalians • 15,000 Swiss • 10,000 Danes and Norwegians • 4,000 Spaniards• 4,000 Portuguese • 3,500 Croats • 2,000 Irish

The new &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was somewhat different from before; over one-third of its ranks were now filled by non-French conscripts coming from satellite states or countries allied to France. The behemoth force crossed the Niemen River on 24 June 1812, and Napoleon hoped that quick marching could place his men between the two main Russian armies, commanded by Generals Barclay de Tolly and Pyotr Bagration. However, the campaign was characterized by many frustrations, as the Russians succeeded no less than three times in evading Napoleon&#x27;s pincers. A final stand for the defence of Moscow led to the massive Battle of Borodino on 7 September 1812. There the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; won a bloody but indecisive and arguably pyrrhic victory. A week after the battle, the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; finally entered Moscow only to find the city largely empty and ablaze. Its soldiers were now forced to deal with the fires while hunting down arsonists and guarding the city&#x27;s historic districts. Napoleon and his army spent over a month in Moscow, vainly hoping that the Russian emperor would respond to the French peace offers. After these efforts failed, the French set out on October 19, now only a shadow of their former selves. The epic retreat over the Russian winter dominates popular conceptions of the war, even though over half of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; had been lost during the summer. The French were harassed repeatedly by the converging Russian armies, Marshal Michel Ney even conducting a rearguard separation between his troops and the Russians, and by the time the Berezina was reached Napoleon only had about 49,000 troops and 40,000 stragglers of little military value. The resulting battle and the monumental work of General Jean Baptiste Eblé&#x27;s engineers saved the remnants of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. Napoleon left his men in order to reach Paris and address new military and political matters. Of the 685,000 men that constituted the initial invasion force, only 93,000 survived.

===1813–1815===

The catastrophe in Russia now emboldened anti-French sentiments throughout Europe. The Sixth Coalition was formed and Germany became the centrepiece of the upcoming campaign. With customary genius, Napoleon raised new armies and opened up the campaign with a series of victories at Lützen and Bautzen. But due to the poor quality of French troops and cavalry following the Russian campaign, along with miscalculations by certain subordinate marshals, these triumphs were not decisive enough to win the war and only secured an armistice. Napoleon hoped to use this respite to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, but when Austria joined the Allies, his strategic situation grew bleak. The campaign reopened in August with a significant French victory at the two-day Battle of Dresden. However, the adoption of the Trachenberg Plan by the Allies, which called for avoiding direct conflict with Napoleon and focusing on his subordinates, paid dividends as the French suffered defeats at Großbeeren, the Katzbach, Kulm, and Dennewitz. Growing Allied numbers eventually hemmed the French in at Leipzig, where the three-day Battle of the Nations witnessed a heavy loss for Napoleon when a bridge was prematurely destroyed, abandoning 30,000 French soldiers on the other side of the Elster River. The campaign, however, did end on a victorious note when the French destroyed an isolated Bavarian corps which was trying to block their retreat at Hanau.

&quot;The Grand Empire is no more. It is France herself we must now defend&quot;, were Napoleon&#x27;s words to the Senate at the end of 1813. The emperor managed to raise new armies, but strategically he was in a virtually hopeless position. Allied armies were invading from the Pyrenees, across the plains of Northern Italy, and via France&#x27;s eastern borders as well. The campaign began ominously when Napoleon suffered a defeat at the Battle of La Rothière, but he quickly regained his former spirit. In the Six Days&#x27; Campaign of February 1814, the 30,000-man &quot;Grande Armée&quot; inflicted 20,000 casualties on Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher&#x27;s scattered corps at a cost of just 2,000 for themselves. They then headed south and defeated Field Marshal Karl von Schwarzenberg&#x27;s corps at the Battle of Montereau. These victories, however, could not remedy such the situation, and French defeats at the Battle of Laon and the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube dampened moods. At the end of March, Paris fell to the Allies. Napoleon wanted to keep fighting, but his marshals refused, forcing him to abdicate on 6 April 1814.

After returning from exile on Elba in February 1815, Napoleon busied himself in making a renewed push to secure his empire. For the first time since 1812, the Army of the North he would be commanding for the upcoming campaign was professional and competent. Napoleon hoped to catch and defeat the Allied armies under the Duke of Wellington and Blücher in Belgium before the Russians and Austrians could arrive. The campaign, beginning on 15 June 1815, was initially successful, leading to victory over the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on 16 June; however, poor staff work, and bad commanders led to many problems for the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; throughout the entire campaign. Marshal Emmanuel de Grouchy&#x27;s delayed advance against the Prussians allowed Blücher to rally his men after Ligny and march on to Wellington&#x27;s aid at the Battle of Waterloo, which resulted in the final, decisive defeat for Napoleon.

==Staff system==
Prior to the late 18th century, there was generally no organisational support for staff functions such as military intelligence, logistics, planning or personnel. Unit commanders handled such functions for their units, with informal help from subordinates who were usually not trained for or assigned to a specific task.

The first modern use of a General Staff was in the French Revolutionary Wars, when General Louis-Alexandre Berthier (later Marshal) was assigned as Chief of Staff to the Army of Italy in 1795. Berthier was able to establish a well-organised staff support team. Napoleon took over the army the following year and quickly came to appreciate Berthier&#x27;s system, adopting it for his own headquarters, although Napoleon&#x27;s usage was limited to his own command group.

The Staff of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was known as the Imperial Headquarters and was divided into two major sections: Napoleon&#x27;s Military Household and the Army General Headquarters. A third department dependent on the Imperial Headquarters was the office of the &quot;Intendant Général&quot; (Quartermaster General), providing the administrative staff of the army.

===Napoleon&#x27;s Military Household===

The Maison Militaire de l&#x27;Empereur (Military Household of the Emperor) was Napoleon&#x27;s personal military staff and included the department of aides-de-camp (ADCs), orderly officers (until 1809), the Emperor&#x27;s Cabinet with the Secretariat, a department that collected intelligence about the enemy using spies and the topographical department. Attached was also the Emperor&#x27;s Civil Cabinet that included the office of the Grand Marshal of the Palace and the Grand Écuyer.

The ADCs to the emperor were mainly loyal, experienced generals or, at times, other senior officers whom he knew from his Italian or Egyptian campaigns. All were known for their bravery and were experts in their own branches of service. Working directly under the supervision of the emperor, these officers were sometimes assigned to temporary command of units or formations or entrusted with diplomatic missions. Most of the time, however, their tasks consisted of making detailed inspection tours and long-distance reconnaissances. When they had to carry orders from the emperor to an army commander, these would be verbal rather than written. The appointment of ADC to the emperor was so influential that they were considered to be &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s eyes and ears&quot; and even marshals were wise to follow their advice and render them the respect due to their function.

On 29 April 1809, a decree organised their service. Every morning at 0700, the duty ADC and his staff were relieved and the new ADC for the next 24 hours had to present the emperor with a list of names of the staff under his command. This would consist of two supplementary daytime general ADCs and one night ADC, one equerry and (through a rotation system) half the number of orderly officers, half the number of the &quot;petits aides de camp&quot; (two or three personal ADCs to the general ADCs, who might also be commanded directly by the emperor) and half the number of pages. Their number differed from time to time, but only 37 officers were ever commissioned ADC to the emperor and at normal times their number was restricted to 12. Each of these officers wore the normal general&#x27;s uniform of his rank, but with gold aiguillettes as the symbol of his function. The appointment of ADC to the emperor did not always last as long as the emperor&#x27;s reign; an ADC might be given another position such as a field command, a governorship, etc. and would be removed from his ADC status until recalled to that post.

The &quot;officiers d&#x27;ordonnance&quot; (orderly officers) may be considered as junior ADCs, with the rank of &quot;chef d&#x27;escadron&quot;, captain or lieutenant. They, too, were used for special missions such as reconnaissance and inspections, but also to carry written orders. In 1806, when these posts were created, they were members of the Imperial Guard; in 1809, while retaining their military status, they were taken under control of the &quot;Grand Écuyer&quot; in the Emperor&#x27;s Civil Household. The decrees regulating their service were signed on 15, 19 and 24 September 1806 and finally on 19 September 1809.

===Army General Headquarters===
Alongside the Emperor&#x27;s Military Household but functioning as a totally independent organisation was the &quot;Grand État-Major Général&quot; (Army General Headquarters). Since the earliest collaboration of Napoleon and Berthier, its organisation was more or less fixed and it would see only slight changes during the later campaigns of the empire. The Army General Headquarters included the office of the &quot;Major-Général&quot;″s (Chief of Staff&#x27;s) Cabinet with their four departments: Movements, Secretariat, Accounting and Intelligence (orders of battle). The &quot;Major-Général&quot; also had his own private Military Staff which included duty Generals and Staff aides-de-camp. Finally there was the Army General Staff with the offices of the three Assistant Major-Generals to the &quot;Major-Général&quot;.

The role of Chief of Staff in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; became almost synonymous with Berthier, who occupied this position in almost all the major campaigns of Napoleon. The General Headquarters was Berthier&#x27;s unique domain and the emperor respected this demarcation. Its personnel received orders only from Berthier and even Napoleon did not interfere in its immense tasks; he would never walk in on Berthier&#x27;s private staff while they were writing and copying the orders that he had just given. Since the emperor was his own &quot;operations officer&quot;, it can be said that Berthier&#x27;s job consisted of absorbing Napoleon&#x27;s strategic intentions, translating them into written orders and transmitting them with the utmost speed and clarity. He also received in the emperor&#x27;s name the reports of the marshals and commanding generals and when necessary signed them on Napoleon&#x27;s behalf. Detailed reports on everything that occurred for good or ill were to be sent to Berthier, who would in turn select the most important ones and transmit them to the emperor; nothing was to be concealed from Napoleon.

Lest one think this was as safe a job as modern staff officers, a contemporary subordinate staff officer, Brossier, reports that at the Battle of Marengo:
&quot;The General-in-Chief Berthier gave his orders with the precision of a consummate warrior, and at Marengo maintained the reputation that he so rightly acquired in Italy and in Egypt under the orders of Bonaparte. He himself was hit by a bullet in the arm. Two of his aides-de-camp, Dutaillis and La Borde, had their horses killed.&quot;

==Organisation==

One of the most important factors in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;″s success was its superior and highly flexible organisation. It was subdivided into several corps (usually from five to seven), each numbering anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000, with the average size being around 20,000 to 30,000 troops. These &quot;Corps d&#x27;Armée&quot; were self-contained, smaller armies of combined arms, consisting of elements from all the forces and support services discussed below. While capable of fully independent operations and of defending themselves until reinforced, the corps usually worked in close concert together and kept within a day&#x27;s marching distance of one another. The corps would often follow separate routes on a wide front and were small enough to live by foraging, allowing fewer supplies to be carried. Through dispersion and the use of forced marches the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was often able to surprise opposing armies by its speed of manoeuver. A corps, depending on its size and the importance of its mission, was commanded by a &quot;marshal&quot;, &quot;général en chef&quot; (general in chief (until 1812)) or &quot;général de division&quot; (lieutenant general).

Napoleon placed great trust in his corps commanders and usually allowed them a wide freedom of action, provided they acted within the outlines of his strategic objectives and worked together to accomplish them. When they failed to do this to his satisfaction, however, he would not hesitate to reprimand or relieve them and in many cases took personal command of their corps himself. Corps were first formed in 1800, when General Jean Moreau divided the Army of the Rhine into four corps. These were only temporary groupings, however, and it was not until 1804 that Napoleon made them permanent units. He would sometimes form the cavalry into separate corps, so they would be able to move and mass more quickly without being slowed by the infantry or foot artillery.

The main tactical units of the corps were the divisions, usually consisting of 4,000 to 10,000 infantry or 2,000 to 4,000 cavalrymen. These in turn were made up of two or three brigades of two regiments apiece and supported by an artillery brigade of three or four batteries, each with six field cannons and two howitzers, making 24 to 32 guns in all. The divisions were also permanent administrative and operational units, commanded by a &quot;général de division&quot; and likewise capable of independent actions.

==Forces of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;==
===Imperial Guard===
The Imperial Guard (&quot;Garde impériale&quot;) was one of the most elite military forces of its time, and grew out of the Consular Guard (&quot;Garde consulaire&quot;). It formed a single &quot;Corps d&#x27;Armée&quot; with infantry, cavalry and artillery units like other corps, but with unique identities and uniforms. Napoleon also wanted it to be an example for the entire army to follow, and a force that, since it had fought with him over several campaigns, was completely loyal. Although the infantry was rarely committed en masse, the Guard&#x27;s cavalry was often thrown into battle as the killing blow and its artillery used to pound enemies prior to assaults.

====Infantry of the Guard====
There were three sections:
* Old Guard (Vieille Garde): Composed of the longest serving veterans, the Old Guard was the elite of the elite guards regiments of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;.
** Imperial Guard Foot Grenadiers (&quot;Grenadiers à Pied de la Garde Impériale&quot;): The Grenadiers of the Guard was the most senior regiment in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. During the 1807 campaign in Poland, Napoleon gave the Grenadiers the nickname &quot;Les Grognards&quot; (&quot;The Grumblers&quot;). They were the most experienced and bravest infantrymen in the Guard, some veterans having served in over 20 campaigns. To join the Grenadiers, a recruit had to have served for at least 10 years, have received a citation for bravery, be literate, and be over 178 cm tall. The Old Guard were usually held in reserve for crucial moments on the battlefield, and unleashed to act as a hammer blow to a shaken enemy. For example, the &quot;1er Régiment de Grenadiers à Pied&quot; saw heavy action at the Battle of Eylau. By 1815, the Old Guard grenadiers numbered four regiments, the 3rd and 4th Grenadiers having been added in 1810 and 1815 respectively. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Grenadiers were fully engaged at the Battle of Ligny, but two days later were defeated by the British as they advanced to in an attempt to smash the weakened British line at Waterloo. The two battalions of the 1st Grenadiers formed squares and fended off allied attacks to protect the general retreat. The &quot;Grenadiers à Pied&quot; wore a dark blue &quot;habit long&quot; (coat with long tails) with red turnbacks, epaulettes, and white lapels. The most distinguishing feature of the Grenadiers was the tall bearskin hat, decorated with an engraved gold plate, a red plume, and white cords.
** Imperial Guard Foot Chasseurs (&quot;Chasseurs à Pied de la Garde Impériale&quot;): The Chasseurs of the Guard were the second most senior regiment in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. The 1st Chasseurs were the sister formation to the &quot;1er Grenadiers à Pied&quot;. They had the same entry criteria, however accepted men who were 172 cm and taller. The Chasseurs were in action in several crucial battles. Following Napoleon&#x27;s return in 1815, the Chasseurs was expanded to four regiments also, with the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th regiments being formed from recruits with only four years experience. These regiments also formed the assault of the Guard during the final phase of the Battle of Waterloo. The 2nd battalion of the 1st Chasseurs joined in the main attack of the Middle Guard, but were repulsed, while the second guarded the emperor&#x27;s headquarters. The &quot;Chasseurs à Pied&quot; wore a dark blue &quot;habit long&quot; with red turnbacks, red epaulettes fringed green, and white lapels. On campaign, the Chasseurs often wore dark blue trousers. As with the Grenadiers, the Chasseurs most distinguishing feature was the tall bearskin, decorated with a red over green plume and white cords.
* Middle Guard (&quot;Moyenne Garde&quot;): Consisted of veteran soldiers of at least 3 campaigns.
** Fusiliers-Chasseurs: In 1806, the Fusiliers-Chasseurs was formed as a regiment of the Middle Guard infantry. All members of the Middle Guard were veterans of 2–3 campaigns and were commissioned as NCOs in the line regiments. Arguably the best infantry of the entire Guard, the Fusiliers-Chasseurs most often operated together with its sister formation, the Fusiliers-Grenadiers, as part of a Guard Fusilier-Brigade. The Fusilier-Chasseurs saw extensive action, proving their worth time and time again, until they were disbanded in 1814, following Napoleon&#x27;s abdication. The Fusiliers-Chasseurs were not reformed in 1815 for the Waterloo campaign. The Fusiliers-Chasseurs wore a dark blue &quot;habit&quot; (or coat) with green epaulettes fringed red, red turnbacks and white lapels. Under this they wore a white waistcoat and either blue or brown trousers. The Fusiliers-Chasseurs shako had white cords and a tall red over green plume. The Fusiliers-Chasseurs were armed with a Charleville model 1777 musket, bayonet and a short sabre.
** Fusiliers-Grenadiers: Formed in 1807, the Fusiliers-Grenadiers was a regiment of Middle Guard infantry. The Fusiliers-Grenadiers was organised in the same way as the Fusiliers-Chasseurs, being a slightly larger formation. The Fusiliers-Grenadiers most often operated together with its sister formation, the Fusiliers-Chasseurs, as a part of a Guard Fusilier-Brigade. The Fusilier-Grenadiers saw extensive action, proving their worth time and time again, until they were disbanded in 1814 following Napoleon&#x27;s abdication. The Fusiliers-Grenadiers were not reformed in 1815. The Fusiliers-Grenadiers wore a dark blue &quot;habit&quot; with red epaulettes, red turnbacks, and white lapels. Under this they wore a white waistcoat and white trousers. The Fusiliers-Grenadiers wore a shako with white cords and a tall red plume. The Fusiliers-Grenadiers were armed with a Charleville model 1777 musket, bayonet, and a short sabre.
** Marines of the Guard (&quot;Marins de la Garde&quot;): Sometimes translated as &quot;Seamen of the Guard&quot;, the Marines of the Guard were formed in 1803, with their initial purpose being to man the vessel transporting the emperor during the expected crossing of the English Channel prior to the invasion of Britain. The battalion was formed with five &quot;équipages&quot; (or crews), companies in all but name. After the cancellation of the invasion, the Marines remained a part of the Guard, manning whatever boat, barge or other water vessel Napoleon traveled in, as well as acting as a combat unit. Seamen of the Guard wore navy blue hussar-style dolman jackets, laced gold, and navy blue Hungarian style trousers decorated with gold lace. They wore a shako trimmed in gold with a tall red plume. Seamen were armed as infantry, with a Charleville model 1777 musket and bayonet, and many seamen were also equipped with pistols, less cumbersome during their engineering tasks.
* Young Guard (&quot;Jeune Garde&quot;): Initially, the Young Guard was made up of veterans with at least one campaign under their belts, together with bright young officers and the best of the annual intake of conscripts. Later its ranks would be filled almost entirely by select conscripts and volunteers.
** Tirailleurs-Grenadiers: In 1808, Napoleon ordered the most intelligent and strongest recruits to be formed into the first regiments of the Young Guard. The tallest of the recruits were inducted into the Tirailleurs-Grenadier regiments (renamed Tirailleurs in 1810). All officers of the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers were drawn from the Old Guard, and as such were entitled to wear bearskins. The NCOs were drawn from the Middle Guard. Having this leavening of hardened veterans helped to increase the morale and combat abilities of the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers, and its sister formations the Tirailleurs-Chasseurs. Tirailleurs-Grenadiers wore a dark blue &quot;habit&quot; with red epaulettes, dark blue turnbacks, and lapels piped white. The Tirailleurs-Grenadiers&#x27; shako had red cords with a long red plume.
** Tirailleurs-Chasseurs: The shorter recruits of the Young Guard were inducted into the Tirailleurs-Chasseurs (renamed to Voltigeurs in 1810). The formation was identical to that of the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers, with all officers being drawn from the Old Guard, and NCOs coming from the Middle Guard. Tirailleurs-Grenadiers wore a dark blue &quot;habit&quot; with red turnbacks and dark blue lapels piped white. This was further decorated by green epaulettes with red fringing. Their shako was decorated with a large plume which could be coloured either green or red over green.

====Marines of the Guard====

The four regiments of marines of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; disappeared on 28 January 1794. The &quot;Marins&quot; (French spelling) of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; were divided into the &quot;Bataillon des Marins de la Garde Impériale&quot;, also known eventually as the &quot;Matelots de la Garde&quot;, formed on 17 September 1803, and &quot;Matelots des Bataillons de la Marine Impériale&quot; of which some 32,000 served with the French Navy at its height of expansion by Napoleon. Units of the latter were created for service on land by conscripting naval personnel surplus to requirement of the navy. There was also the marine artillery, which were mostly naval gunners used for coastal batteries and fortresses called &quot;bataillons de la Matelot du Haut-Bord&quot; (or &quot;Les Equipages de Haut-Bord&quot; – marines of the High Shore) created by decree of Napoleon on 1 April 1808. The flag of the &quot;1er Régiment d&#x27;Artillerie de Marine&quot; survives today, and lists Lützen 1813 as one of its battle honours. Some 63 artillery batteries were manned (some numbers remaining vacant). Some examples include:

* 22&quot;ième Équipage de Haut-Bord&quot; from the ship &quot;Donauwörth&quot;
* Marine &quot;Regiment de Rochefort&quot; included the 16&quot;ième bataillon de marins&quot;
* Marine &quot;equipage de vasseux Admiral de Ruyter&quot;
* Marine &quot;equipage de vasseux L&#x27;Hannibal&quot; (serving with the &quot;Regiment de Rochefort 16ième bataillon&quot;)
* 4&quot;ième Équipage de Haut-Bord de vasseux Friedland&quot;
* 5&quot;ième&quot; and 48&quot;ième Équipage de Haut-Bord de vasseux La Licorne&quot;

The &quot;Marins de la Garde&quot; (transliterated as &quot;Sailors of the Guard&quot;, but more accurately &quot;Marines of the Guard)&quot; were organised into five &quot;equipages&quot; (ship&#x27;s company), each with five &quot;escouades&quot;, with a total strength of 737 men, the unit having been created ostensibly for preparation of the invasion of Britain.

The unit was almost entirely destroyed in the Spanish campaign of 1808 at Bailén, but was rebuilt, and in 1810 the battalion was expanded to eight &quot;equipages&quot; with a total of 1,136 men, but this was severely reduced during the Russian campaign, and only 350 officers and men remained in its ranks by 1813. With Napoleon&#x27;s first abdication, an ensign and 21 marines accompanied him to Elba, and returned with him for the Hundred Days campaign when their strength was increased to an &quot;equipage&quot; of 150 officers and men.

The marines were distinct in several ways from other &quot;Grande Armée&quot; units in that naval rather than army ranks were used, the uniform was based on that of those of the hussars, and it was the only unit of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in which the musicians used both the drums and the trumpets.

The battalions of marine artillery were conscripted for the 1813 German Campaign, and included four regiments with the 1st regiment intended to have 8 battalions, 2nd regiment with 10 battalions, and the 3rd and 4th regiments with four battalions each, totalling 9,640 men in all serving with Marshal Auguste de Marmont&#x27;s VI Corps. Combined with sailor battalions, these fought as part of the &quot;Division de Marine&quot; at the battles of Lützen, Bautzen, Dresden, and won high praise at the Battle of Leipzig. The Marine Guard units were disbanded in 1815.

====Cavalry of the Guard====
In 1804, the Cavalry of the Guard consisted of two regiments, the &quot;Chasseurs à Cheval&quot; and the &quot;Grenadiers à Cheval&quot;, along with a small unit of elite Gendarmes and a squadron of Mamelukes. A third regiment was added in 1806, the &quot;Regiment de Dragons de la Garde Impériale&quot; (Later known as the &quot;Dragons de l&#x27;Imperatice&quot;, the Empress Dragoons). Following the campaign in Poland in 1807, a regiment of Polish lancers, the &quot;Regiment de Chevau-Légers de la Garde Impériale Polonais&quot; was added. The final addition was made in 1810, with another regiment of lancers, this time drawn from French and Dutch recruits, the &quot;2e Regiment de Chevau-Légers Lanciers de la Garde Impériale&quot; or Red Lancers. The Cavalry of the Guard was involved in combat numerous times, and with few exceptions proved its worth in action.
* Imperial Guard Horse Grenadiers (&quot;Grenadiers à Cheval de la Garde Impériale&quot;): Known as the &quot;Gods&quot; or the &quot;Giants&quot;, these troopers were the elite of Napoleon&#x27;s Guard Cavalry and the mounted counterparts of the &quot;Grognards&quot;. The Horse Grenadiers wore tall bearskin caps, dark blue coats and collars, white lapels, and tall boots. The entire formation was mounted on large black horses. A prospective recruit had to be over 176 cm tall, have accrued 10 years of service serving in a minimum of four campaigns, and have received a citation for bravery. The Grenadiers were effective at Austerlitz, where they defeated the Russian Guard cavalry, but their most powerful combat was at the Battle of Eylau. After standing under the fire of sixty Russian guns for a time, the troopers began to search for cover. Their commander, Colonel Louis Lepic, ordered the troops, &quot;Up with your heads gentlemen, those are only bullets, not turds&quot;. Soon after they joined Marshal Murat&#x27;s charge into the Russian lines. The Horse Grenadiers, together with the Polish lancers, were the only Guard Cavalry units never beaten in battle.

* Imperial Guard Horse Chasseurs (&quot;Chasseurs à cheval de la Garde Impériale&quot;): Known as the &quot;Favoured Children&quot; (connotations of &quot;Spoiled Brats&quot;), the &quot;Chasseurs à Cheval&quot; of the Guard were the light cavalry of the Guard, Napoleon&#x27;s favourites, and one of the most recognisable units in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. 

::In 1796, during the Italian campaign, Napoleon ordered the formation of a bodyguard unit after he narrowly escaped an attack by Austrian light cavalry at Borghetto while at lunch. This 200-man unit of Guides was the forerunner of the &quot;Chasseurs à Cheval&quot; of the Guard. They usually provided the personal escort of the Emperor. Their close affiliation with the emperor was shown by the fact that he habitually wore the old-style uniform of a colonel of their regiment. The Chasseurs themselves wore flamboyant green, red, and gold hussar style uniforms. They first saw combat during the Battle of Austerlitz, where they played a role in defeating the Russian Guard cavalry. During the Peninsular War, the Chasseurs were ambushed by a large British cavalry force at Benavente in 1808 and were defeated. They regained their reputation by showing extreme bravery during the Battle of Waterloo.
* Elite Gendarmes (&quot;Gendarmerie d&#x27;Elite&quot;): Nicknamed the &quot;Immortals&quot; because they rarely saw combat, the Gendarmes nonetheless performed a vital role. Gendarmes were the military police of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. Along with maintaining security and order near the headquarters, the Gendarmes would provide honour guards for high-ranking visitors, interrogate prisoners, and protect the emperor&#x27;s personal baggage. The Gendarmes wore dark blue coats with red lapels and tall boots, along with a bearskin cap slightly smaller than that of the Horse Grenadiers. After 1807, the Gendarmes began to see more combat, distinguishing themselves in guarding the Danube bridges at Aspern-Essling in 1809.
* Squadron of Mamelukes (&quot;Escadron de Mamelouks&quot;): Fearsome desert warriors, whose loyalty Napoleon purchased during his Egyptian campaign. They combined superb horsemanship and swordsmanship with fanatical courage. Often romantically viewed as &quot;authentic sons of the desert&quot; or even &quot;head-hunters&quot;, their officers were French, the NCOs and ranks comprising not only Egyptians and Turks, but also Greeks, Georgians, Syrians, and Cypriots as well, and even many of them were French. Originally they were an attached company (or &quot;Half-Squadron&quot;) of the &quot;Chasseurs a Cheval de la Garde&quot;. They distinguished themselves at Austerlitz in 1805, winning their own standard, a second trumpeter and promotion to full squadron. This unit eventually became part of the Old Guard, and served the emperor right up to Waterloo. In 1813, a second Mameluke company was raised and attached to the Young Guard. As with their predecessors, they were incorporated into the Chasseurs, and served alongside them during the Hundred Days in 1815. By this time, the personnel being almost exclusively Frenchmen. Their distinct and colourful uniforms consisted of a green (later red) &quot;cahouk&quot; (hat), white turban, a loose shirt and a vest and red &quot;saroual&quot; (baggy trousers), with yellow, red, or tan boots. Their weapons consisted of a long, curved Scimitar, a brace of pistols, and a dagger. Their hats and weapons were inscribed with a crescent and star insignia of brass.
* Lancers of the Guard (&quot;Chevau-Légers-Lanciers de la Garde Impériale&quot;):
** 1st Light Horse Regiment (Polish): In 1807 Napoleon authorized the raising of a guard regiment of Polish light cavalry. They were to be given French instructors and training. But during their first review before the emperor, their ranks became so entangled that Napoleon quipped, &quot;These people only know how to fight!&quot; and dismissed their instructors on the spot. But he kept his Polish cavalrymen by his side and the following year at Somosierra they would have another opportunity to prove themselves, on the battlefield instead of the parade ground. Napoleon ordered them to charge against a heavily fortified Spanish artillery position. Armed with only sabres and pistols, they overran four batteries, capturing over 20 cannons and decisively turned the tide. Following this, almost legendary, feat Napoleon proclaimed &quot;Poles, You are worthy of my Old Guard I proclaim you my bravest cavalry!&quot;. Promoted to the Old Guard, they were then given lances, remained at the Emperor&#x27;s side until Waterloo, and were never defeated by enemy cavalry. The 1e Regiment of the Guard developed a rivalry with their fellow Poles of the 1st Vistula Uhlans. This was not simply based on who was the better unit, but on deep political differences as well, with the lancers being fanatical Bonapartists, while many, if not most, of the uhlans held fiercely Republican sentiments. Such differences, political and otherwise, between units were not unusual and are well illustrated here. From being instructed by the French, they, along with their Vistula rivals, would go on to serve as instructors and models for the French and most other lancer regiments of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, thus greatly multiplying their fearsome effectiveness.
** 2nd Light Horse Regiment (French-Dutch): Formed in 1810 from a French and Dutch cadre. They were called &quot;Les Lanciers Rouges&quot; (the Red Lancers) due to their distinctive uniforms. They too suffered heavily in Russia at the hands of the Cossacks and the hardships of the winter, with most of its men and all but a handful of the horses lost. The regiment was rebuilt in 1813 and it became a powerful unit with its first four squadrons of veterans in the Old Guard and the new recruits of 6 junior squadrons in the Young Guard. They would distinguish themselves in numerous engagements, including Waterloo.
** 3rd Light Horse Regiment (Polish): Formed in 1812 as part of the Young Guard, its officers and NCOs were veterans, but its ranks were filled by enthusiastic yet inexperienced students and sons of Polish and Lithuanian landholders. With little training, they were thrown into the Russian campaign where they were surrounded and the entire regiment wiped out at Slonim later that year by Cossacks and hussars.
* Empress Dragoons (&quot;Dragons de l&#x27;Impératice&quot;): Formed in 1806 as the Imperial Guard Dragoon Regiment (&quot;Regiment de Dragons de la Garde Impériale&quot;), it was renamed in honor of Empress Joséphine the following year. Originally, candidates had to have at least 6 (later 10) years of service, participated in no fewer than 2 campaigns with citations for bravery, be literate, and at least 173 cm tall (slightly shorter than for the Horse Grenadier Guards). No more than 12 candidates from each of the 30 regular dragoon regiments were allowed to apply at any one call, this quota would later be reduced to 10. Volunteers from other guard regiments were also allowed to transfer. Since this was as much a ceremonial as a combat unit and was rarely committed in battle, billets in the Empress Dragoons were highly sought after positions. As with the Red Lancers, it had squadrons in both the Old and Young Guards and served with the emperor until the end.
* Scouts of the Imperial Guard (&quot;Eclaireurs de la Garde Impériale&quot;): During the retreat from Moscow, Napoleon was highly impressed by the skills of many regiments of Cossacks. He used them as a model to create a new cavalry brigade, the Scouts, which were formed during the reorganisation of the Imperial Guard in December 1813. 3 regiments of a thousand men each were created and their squadrons attached to existing regiments:
** 1st Regiment: scouts-grenadiers under Colonel-Major Claude Testot-Ferry&#x27;s command (wounded and titled Baron of the Empire by Napoleon himself on the battlefield of Craonne on 7 March 1814)
** 2nd Regiment: scouts-dragoons under Colonel Hoffmayer&#x27;s command
** 3rd Regiment: scouts-lanciers under Jean Kozietulski&#x27;s command
The scouts had only the time to distinguish themselves during the defence of France in 1814 and were dissolved by King Louis XVIII upon the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.

===Infantry===
While the infantry was perhaps not the most glamorous arm of service in the Grande Armée, they bore the brunt of most of the fighting, and their performance resulted in victory or defeat. The infantry was divided up into two major types, the Infantry of the Line (&quot;Infanterie de Ligne&quot;) and the Light Infantry (&quot;Infanterie Légère&quot;).

====Line Infantry====
The line infantry made up the majority of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. In 1803, Napoleon had reinstated the term &quot;regiment&quot;, the revolutionary term &quot;demi-brigade&quot; (due to the fact there were two per brigade and it lacked the royal connotations) was now only used for provisional troops and depot units. At the time of the formation of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, the French Army had 133 &quot;Régiments de Ligne&quot;, a number which roughly corresponded with the number of &quot;départements&quot; in France. There would eventually be 156 &quot;Ligne&quot; regiments.

The &quot;Régiments de Ligne&quot; varied in size throughout the Napoleonic Wars, but the basic building block of the Infantry of the Line was the battalion. A line infantry battalion was numbered at about 840 men; however, this was the battalion&#x27;s &#x27;full strength&#x27; and few units ever reached this. A more typical strength for a battalion would be 400–600 men. From 1800 to 1803, a line infantry battalion had eight fusilier companies and one grenadier company. From 1804 to 1807, a line infantry battalion had seven fusilier companies, one grenadier company, and one voltigeur company. From 1808 to 1815, a line infantry battalion had four companies of fusiliers, one company of grenadiers, and one company of voltigeurs. According to the 1808 regulation, the staff of each company and the regiment HQ was the following:


In total, there were supposed to be 3,970 men in a regiment (840 in each four main battalions, and 560 in the rear battalion), among them 108 officers and 3,862 noncommissioned officers and privates.

=====Grenadiers=====

Grenadiers were the elite of the line infantry and the veteran shock troops of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. Newly formed battalions did not have a grenadier company; rather, Napoleon ordered that after two campaigns, several of the strongest, bravest, and tallest fusiliers were to be promoted to a grenadier company, so each line battalion which had seen more than two campaigns had one company of grenadiers.

Regulations required that grenadier recruits were to be the tallest, most fearsome men in the regiments, and all were to have moustaches. To add to this, grenadiers were initially equipped with a &quot;bonnet à poil&quot; or bearskin, as well as red epaulettes on their coat. After 1807, regulations stipulated that line grenadiers were to replace their bearskin with a shako lined red with a red plume; however, many chose to retain their bearskins. In addition to the standard Charleville model 1777 and bayonet, grenadiers were also equipped with a short sabre. This was to be used for close combat, but most often ended up serving as a tool to cut wood for campfires.

A grenadier company would usually be situated on the right side of a formation, traditionally the place of greatest honour since the days of hoplite warfare in which a corps&#x27; right flank had less protection from the shield line of its formation. During a campaign, grenadier companies could be detached to form a grenadier battalion or occasionally a regiment or brigade. These formations would then be used as a shock force or the vanguard for a larger formation.

=====Voltigeurs of the Line=====
Voltigeurs (literally, &quot;Vaulters&quot; or &quot;Leapers&quot;) were elite light infantry of the line regiments. In 1805, Napoleon ordered that the smallest, most agile men of the line battalions be chosen to form a voltigeur company. These troops were to be second only to the grenadiers in the battalion hierarchy. Their name comes from their original mission; Voltigeurs were to vault upon horses of friendly cavalry for faster movement, an idea which proved impractical if not outright impossible. Despite this, the voltigeurs did perform a valuable task, skirmishing and providing scouts for each battalion, as well as providing an organic light infantry component for each line regiment. In training, emphasis was placed on marksmanship and quick movement.

Voltigeurs were equipped with large yellow and green or yellow and red plumes for their bicornes. After 1807, their shakos were lined with yellow and carried similar plumes. They also had yellow epaulettes lined green and a yellow collar on their coats.

Originally, voltigeurs were to be equipped with the short dragoon musket, however in practice, they were equipped with the Charleville model 1777 and bayonet. Like grenadiers, voltigeurs were equipped with a short sabre for close combat, and like grenadiers this was rarely used. Voltigeur companies could be detached and formed into regiments or brigades to create a light infantry formation. After 1808, the voltigeur company was situated on the left of the line when in combat. This was traditionally the second highest position of honour in the line of battle.

=====Fusiliers=====

The fusiliers made up the majority of a line infantry battalion, and may be considered the typical infantryman of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. Fusiliers were armed with a smoothbore, muzzle-loaded flintlock Charleville model 1777 musket and a bayonet. Fusilier training placed emphasis on speed of march and endurance, along with individually aimed fire at close range and close quarters combat. This differed greatly from the training given to the majority of European armies, which emphasised moving in rigid formations and firing massed volleys. Many of the early Napoleonic victories were due to the ability of the French armies to cover long distances with speed, and this ability was thanks to the training given to the infantry. From 1803, each battalion comprised eight fusilier companies. Each company numbered around 120 men.

In 1805, one of the fusilier companies was dissolved and reformed as a voltigeur company. In 1808, Napoleon reorganised the infantry battalion from nine to six companies. The new companies were to be larger, comprising 140 men, and four of these were to be made up of fusiliers, one of grenadiers, and one of voltigeurs.

The fusiliers wore a bicorne, until this was superseded by the shako in 1807. The uniform of a fusilier consisted of white trousers, white surcoat and a dark blue coat (the &quot;habit long&quot; model until 1812, thereafter the &quot;habit veste&quot;) with white lapels, red collar and cuffs. Each fusilier wore a coloured pom-pom on his hat. The colour of this pom-pom changed depending on the company the man belonged to, as military uniforms reached their pinnacle at around this period in time. After the 1808 reorganisation, the first company was issued with a dark green pom-pom, the second with sky blue, the third with orange and the fourth with violet.

====Light Infantry====
While the infantry of the line made up the majority of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;″s infantry, the &quot;Infanterie Légère&quot; (Light Infantry) also played an important role. The &quot;Légère&quot; regiments never numbered more than 36 (compared with the 133 of the &quot;Ligne&quot; regiments), and the &quot;Ligne&quot; could perform all the same manoeuvres, including skirmishes. The difference laid in the training and the resulting high &quot;esprit de corps&quot;.

Training for &quot;Légère&quot; units placed strong emphasis on marksmanship and fast movement. As a result, the general &quot;Légère&quot; soldier was able to shoot more accurately and move faster than his &quot;Ligne&quot; counterpart. &quot;Légère&quot; regiments tended to see more action and were often used to screen large manoeuvres. Naturally, because commanders turned to the &quot;Légère&quot; for more missions than the &quot;Ligne&quot;, the &quot;Légère&quot; troopers enjoyed a higher esprit de corps and were known for their flamboyant uniforms and attitude. Also, &quot;Légère&quot; troops were required to be shorter than line troops, which helped them to move quickly through forests as well as to hide behind obstacles when skirmishing. The formation of a &quot;Légère&quot; battalion exactly mirrored that of a line infantry battalion, but different troop types were substituted for the grenadiers, fusiliers and voltigeurs.

=====&quot;Carabiniers-à-Pied&quot;=====
The carabiniers were the grenadiers of the &quot;Légère&quot; battalions. After two campaigns, the tallest and bravest chasseurs were chosen to join a carabinier company. They performed as elite shock troops for the battalion. As with the grenadiers, carabiniers were required to wear moustaches. They were armed with the Charleville model 1777, a bayonet, and a short sabre. The carabinier uniform consisted of a tall bearskin cap (superseded in 1807 by a red trimmed shako with a red plume). They wore the same uniform as the chasseurs, but with red epaulettes. Carabinier companies could be detached to form larger all carabinier formations for assaults or other operations requiring assault troops.

=====Light Voltigeurs=====
Voltigeurs performed exactly the same mission in the &quot;Légère&quot; battalion as they did in the line battalions, only they were more nimble and better marksmen. The &quot;Légère&quot; voltigeurs were dressed as chasseurs, but with yellow and green epaulettes and before 1806, a &quot;colpack&quot; (or busby) replaced the shako. The colpack had a large yellow over red plume and green cords. After 1807, a shako replaced the colpack, with a large yellow plume and yellow lining. As with the line voltigeurs, &quot;légère&quot; voltigeurs could be detached and used to form larger formations as needed.

=====&quot;Chasseurs&quot;=====
&quot;Chasseurs&quot; (Hunters) were the fusiliers of the &quot;Légère&quot; battalions. They made up the majority of the formation. They were armed with the Charleville model 1777 musket and a bayonet, and also with a short sabre for close combat.

From 1803, each battalion comprising eight chasseur companies. Each company numbered around 120 men. In 1808, Napoleon reorganised the infantry battalion from nine to six companies. The new companies were to be larger, comprising 140 men, and four of these were to be made up of &quot;chasseurs&quot;.

The &quot;chasseurs&quot; had far more ornate uniforms than their contemporaries the fusiliers. Until 1806, they were equipped with a cylindrical shako with a large dark green plume and decorated with white cords. Their uniform was a darker blue than that of the line regiments, to aid with camouflage while skirmishing. Their coat was similar to that of the line troops, but their lapels and cuffs were also dark blue, and it featured dark green and red epaulettes. They also wore dark blue trousers and high imitation hussar boots. After 1807, the cylindrical shako was replaced with the standard shako, but was still embellished by white cords. As with the line fusiliers, &quot;chasseur&quot; companies were distinguished by coloured pom-poms, but the colours for the different companies changed from regiment to regiment.

===Cavalry===
By decree of the emperor himself, cavalry typically were between a fifth and a sixth of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. Cavalry regiments of 800–1,200 men were made up of three or four escadrons of two companies each, plus supporting elements. In light cavalry and dragoon regiments, the first company of every regiment&#x27;s first escadron, was always designated as &#x27;elite&#x27;, with presumably, the best men and horses. In the revolution&#x27;s wake, the cavalry suffered the greatest from the loss of experienced aristocratic officers and NCOs still loyal to the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. Consequently, the quality of French cavalry drastically declined. Napoleon rebuilt the branch, turning it into arguably the finest in the world. Until 1812, it was undefeated in any large engagements above the regimental level. There were two primary types of cavalry for different roles, heavy and light.
====Heavy cavalry====
=====&quot;Carabiniers-à-Cheval&quot; (Horse Carabiners)=====
The elite among all French heavy cavalry line formations, the two regiments of mounted carabiniers had a very similar appearance with the mounted grenadiers of the Imperial Guard; bearskins, long blue coats, etc. and were mounted exclusively on black horses prior to 1813. They were largely used in identical manner to the Cuirassiers, but being (initially) unarmored, they were less suited for close-quarters, melee combat. Unarmored heavy cavalry was the norm in Europe during most of the Napoleonic Wars, with the French being the first to reintroduce the back-and-breastplate. In 1809, appalled by their mauling at the hands of Austrian uhlans, Napoleon ordered that they be given armour. The carabinier&#x27;s refusal to copy the less elite cuirassiers resulted in them being given special armor, with their helmets and cuirasses being sheathed in bronze for added visual effect. But this did not prevent them from being defeated by Russian cuirassiers at Borodino in 1812, and panicking before Hungarian hussars at Leipzig the following year.

=====Cuirassiers=====
The heavy cavalry, wearing a heavy &quot;cuirass&quot; (breastplate) and helmets of brass and iron and armed with straight long sabers, pistols, and later carbines. Like medieval knights, they served as mounted shock troops. Because of the weight of their armour and weapons, both the trooper and the horse had to be big and strong, and could put a lot of force behind their charge. Though the &quot;cuirass&quot; could not protect against direct musket fire, it could deflect ricochets and shots from long range, and offered some protection from pistol shots. More importantly, the breastplates protected against the swords and lances of opposing cavalry. Napoleon often combined all of his cuirassiers and carabiniers into a cavalry reserve, to be used at the decisive moment of the battle. In this manner, they proved to be an extremely potent force on the battlefield. The British, in particular, who mistakenly believed the cuirassiers were Napoleon&#x27;s bodyguard, and would later come to adapt their distinctive helmets and breastplates for their own Household Cavalry. There were originally 25 cuirassier regiments, reduced to 12 by Napoleon initially who later added three more. At the beginning of his rule, most of the cuirassier regiments were severely understrength, so Napoleon ordered the best men and horses to be allocated to the first 12 regiments, while the rest were reorganised into dragoons.

====Medium cavalry====
=====Dragoons=====
The medium-weight mainstays of the French cavalry, although considered heavy cavalry, who were used for battle, skirmishing, and scouting. They were highly versatile being armed not only with distinctive straight swords, but also muskets with bayonets enabling them to fight as infantry as well as mounted, though fighting on foot had become increasingly uncommon for dragoons of all armies in the decades preceding Napoleon. The versatility of a dual-purpose soldier came at the cost of their horsemanship and swordsmanship often not being up to the same standards as those of other cavalry. Finding enough large horses proved a challenge. Some infantry officers were even required to give up their mounts for the dragoons, creating resentment towards them from this branch as well. There were 25, later 30, dragoon regiments. In 1815, only 15 could be raised and mounted in time for the Waterloo campaign.

====Light cavalry====
===== Hussars =====
These fast, light cavalrymen were the eyes, ears, and egos of the Napoleonic armies. They regarded themselves as the best horsemen and swordsmen (&quot;beau sabreurs&quot;) in the entire &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. This opinion was not entirely unjustified and their flamboyant uniforms reflected their panache. Tactically, they were used for reconnaissance, skirmishing, and screening for the army to keep their commanders informed of enemy movements while denying the enemy the same information and to pursue fleeing enemy troops. Armed only with curved sabres and pistols, they had reputations for reckless bravery to the point of being almost suicidal. It was said by their commander General Antoine Lasalle that a hussar who lived to be 30 was truly an old guard and very fortunate. Lasalle was killed at the Battle of Wagram at age 34. There were 10 regiments in 1804, with an 11th added in 1810 and two more in 1813.

=====&quot;Chasseurs à Cheval&quot; (Mounted Hunters)=====
These were light cavalry identical to hussars in arms and role. But, unlike the chasseurs of the Imperial Guard and their infantry counterparts, they were considered less prestigious or elite. Their uniforms were less colourful as well, consisting of infantry-style shakos (in contrast to the fur busby worn by some French hussars), green coats, green breeches, and short boots. They were, however, the most numerous of the light cavalry, with 31 regiments in 1811, 6 of which comprised Flemish, Swiss, Italians and Germans. was a cavalry composed of chasseurs but on the horse, they could ride into melee or shoot as light infantry

=====Lancers=====
Some of the most feared cavalry in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; were the Polish lancers of the Vistula Uhlans. Nicknamed &quot;Hell&#x27;s Picadors&quot; or &quot;Los Diablos Polacos&quot; (The Polish Devils) by the Spanish, these medium and light horse (&quot;Chevau-Légers Lanciers&quot;) cavalry had near equal speed to the hussars, shock power almost as great as the cuirassiers, and were nearly as versatile as the dragoons. They were armed with, as their name indicates, lances along with sabres and pistols. Initially, French ministers of war insisted on arming all lancers identically. Real battlefield experience, however, proved that the Polish way of arming only the first line with lance while the second rank carried carbines instead was much more practical and thus was adopted. Lancers were the best cavalry for charging against infantry squares, where their lances could outreach the infantry&#x27;s bayonets, (as was the case with Colborne&#x27;s British brigade at Albuera in 1811) and also in hunting down a routed enemy. Their ability to scour and finish off the wounded without ever stepping off their saddle created perfect scenes of horror for the enemy. They could be deadly against other types of cavalry as well, as demonstrated by the fate of Sir William Ponsonby and his Scots Greys at Waterloo. Excluding those of the Guard, there were 9 lancer regiments.

===Artillery===
The emperor was a former artillery officer, and reportedly said &quot;God fights on the side with the best artillery.&quot; As such, French cannons were the backbone of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, possessing the greatest firepower of the three arms and hence the ability to inflict the most casualties in the least amount of time. The French guns were often used in massed batteries (or &quot;grandes batteries&quot;) to soften up enemy formations before being subjected to the closer attention of the infantry or cavalry. Superb gun-crew training allowed Napoleon to move the weapons at great speed to either bolster a weakening defensive position, or else hammer a potential break in enemy lines.

Besides superior training, Napoleon&#x27;s artillery was also greatly aided by the numerous technical improvements to French cannons by General Jean Baptiste de Gribeauval which made them lighter, faster, and much easier to sight, as well as strengthened the carriages and introduced standard sized calibres. In general, French guns were 4-pounders, 8-pounders, or 12-pounders and howitzers with the lighter calibres being phased out and replaced by 6-pounders later in the Napoleonic Wars. French cannons had brass barrels and their carriages, wheels, and limbers were painted olive-green. Superb organisation fully integrated the artillery into the infantry and cavalry units it supported, yet also allowed it to operate independently if the need arose. There were two basic types, &quot;Artillerie à pied&quot; (foot artillery) and &quot;Artillerie à cheval&quot; (horse artillery).

====Foot artillery====
As the name indicates, these gunners marched alongside their guns, which were, of course, pulled by horses when limbered (undeployed). Hence, they travelled at the infantry&#x27;s pace or slower. In 1805, there were eight, later ten, regiments of foot artillery in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; plus two more in the Imperial Guard, but unlike cavalry and infantry regiments, these were administrative organisations. The main operational and tactical units were the batteries (or companies) of 120 men each, which were formed into brigades and assigned to the divisions and corps.
* Divisional artillery: Every division had a brigade of three or four batteries of 8 guns (six cannons and two howitzers) each.
* Corps artillery reserve: Each corps would also have its own artillery reserve, of one or more brigades, armed mostly with the larger, heavier calibre pieces.

Battery personnel included not only gun crews, NCOs, and officers, but drummers, trumpeters, metal workers, woodworkers, ouvriers, furriers, and artificers. They would be responsible for fashioning spare parts, maintaining and repairing the guns, carriages, caissons and wagons, as well as tending the horses and storing munitions.

====Horse artillery====

The cavalry were supported by the fast moving, fast firing light guns of the horse artillery. This arm was a hybrid of cavalry and artillery with their crews riding either on the horses or on the carriages into battle. Because they operated much closer to the front lines, the officers and crews were better armed and trained for close quarters combat, mounted or dismounted much as were the dragoons. Once in position, they were trained to quickly dismount, unlimber (deploy), and sight their guns, then fire rapid barrages at the enemy. They could then quickly limber (undeploy) the guns, remount, and move on to a new position. To accomplish this, they had to be the best trained and most elite of all artillerymen. The horse batteries of the Imperial Guard could go from riding at full gallop to firing their first shot in just under a minute. After witnessing such a performance, an astounded Duke of Wellington remarked, &quot;They move their cannon as if it were a pistol!&quot; There were six administrative regiments of horse artillery plus one in the Guard. In addition to the batteries assigned to the cavalry units, Napoleon would also assign at least one battery to each infantry corps or, if available, to each division. Their abilities came at a price, however, as horse batteries were very expensive to raise and maintain. Consequently, they were far fewer in number than their foot counterparts, typically constituting only one fifth of the artillery&#x27;s strength. It was a boastful joke among their ranks that the emperor knew every horse gunner by name. Besides better training, horses, weapons, and equipment, they used far more ammunition. Horse batteries were given twice the ammo ration of the foot, three times that of the Guard.

====Ammunition====
Of all the types of ammunition used in the Napoleonic Wars, the cast iron, spherical, round shot was the staple of the gunner. Even at long range when the shot was travelling relatively slowly it could be deadly, though it might appear to be bouncing or rolling along the ground relatively gently. At short range, carnage could result.

Round shots were undeniably inaccurate. This was because, despite their name, round shots were never perfectly spherical, nor did they fit their gun barrels exactly. Air acted on the irregular surface of the projectile. These irregularities invariably threw them off target to some degree. It is often also a matter of confusion as to why a 12-pdr shot was so much more effective than a 6-pdr shot. This is because the impact of a shot was not only related to its weight but also to its velocity, which, with a heavier projectile, was much greater at the end of the trajectory.

There were two forms of close-range weapons, which were extremely useful at up to 270m (300 yards). Grapeshot and canister, or case, were the anti-personnel weapons of choice of the gunner. Grape was a cluster of large metal spheres tied together around a central spindle and base and normally sewn into a bag, whereas canister was a metal case filled with smaller iron or lead spheres. The whole purpose of these types of shot was to break up when fired from the gun forming a wide cone of flying metal that acted in the same way as a shotgun cartridge.

For longer-range anti-personnel work, the common shell was also used. This was normally only fired from a mortar or howitzer and was a hollow sphere filled with gunpowder charge. The top of the shell had thinner walls than the bottom and had an orifice into which was forced a wooden fuse normally made of beech wood. The fuse was designed to be ignited by the discharge of the gun and had a central channel drilled through it and filled with a burning compound. Before firing, the fuse was cut to a certain length corresponding to the desired time of burning and hammered into the top of the shell by a mallet. When it arrived over the target, the fuse, if correctly prepared, exploded the main charge, breaking open the metal outer casing and forcing flying fragments in all directions. Although favoured for siege work, the common shell was not always effective against infantry.

The final type of projectile for the field artillery used by the French was the incendiary or carcass (a name for an incendiary projectile). Initially, this device was composed of a metal frame, which was covered with a canvas cover and filled with a special recipe, typically 50 saltpetre parts, 25 sulfur parts, 8 rosin parts, 5 antimony parts, and 5 pitch parts. However, during the early 19th century, another form of carcass became common and this took the form of a common shell with two or three apertures in its exterior into which a similar composition was put. Carcass rounds were normally issued only to howitzers or mortars, the suggestion being they were intended to attack towns. This does not preclude them from being used on the field, but quite what their purpose would have been there is not clear.

It is important to know that not all nations shared the same types of artillery projectiles. For example, the Congreve rocket, inspired from the Mysorean rocket artillery, or the shrapnel shell, which combined the killing effect of grapeshot with the ranges achieved by round shot, were used only by the British Army.

====Artillery train====

The &quot;train d&#x27;artillerie&quot;, was established by Napoleon in January 1800. Its function was to provide the teamsters and drivers which handled the horses that hauled the artillery&#x27;s vehicles. Prior to this, the French, like all other period armies, had employed contracted, civilian teamsters who would sometimes abandon the guns under fire, rendering them immobile, rather than risk their lives or their valuable teams of horses. Its personnel, unlike their civilian predecessors, were armed, trained, and uniformed as soldiers. Apart from making them look better on parade, this made them subject to military discipline and capable of fighting back if attacked. The drivers were armed with a carbine, a short sword of the same type used by the infantry, and a pistol. They needed little encouragement to use these weapons, earning surly reputations for gambling, brawling, and various forms of mischief. Their uniforms and coats of grey helped enhance their tough appearance. But their combativeness could prove useful as they often found themselves attacked by Cossacks and Spanish and Tyrolian guerillas.

Each &quot;train d&#x27;artillerie&quot; battalion was originally composed of 5 companies. The first company was considered elite and assigned to a horse artillery battery; the three &quot;centre&quot; companies were assigned to the foot artillery batteries and &quot;parks&quot; (spare caissons, field forges, supply wagons, etc.); and one became a depot company for training recruits and remounts. Following the campaigns of 1800, the train was re-organised into eight battalions of six companies each. As Napoleon enlarged his artillery, additional battalions were created, rising to a total of fourteen in 1810. In 1809, 1812, and 1813 the first thirteen battalions were &quot;doubled&quot; to create 13 additional battalions. Additionally, after 1809 some battalions raised extra companies to handle the regimental guns attached to the infantry.

The Imperial Guard had its own train, which expanded as &quot;La Garde&quot; artillery park was increased, albeit organised as regiments rather than battalions. At their zenith, in 1813–14, the Old Guard artillery was supported by a 12-company regiment while the Young Guard had a 16-company regiment, one for each of their component artillery batteries.

===Foreign troops in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;===
Many European armies recruited foreign troops, and France was no exception. Foreign troops played an important role and fought with distinction in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; during the Napoleonic Wars. Almost every continental European country was, at different stages, a part of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. By the end of the conflict, tens-of-thousands had served. In 1805, 35,000 troops from France&#x27;s allies were used to protect lines of communications and flanks of the main army. In 1806, 27,000 more troops were called up for similar purposes, plus 20,000 Saxon troops who were used for mopping up operations against the Prussians. In the winter of 1806–07, Germans, Poles, and Spaniards helped seize the Baltic ports of Stralsund and Danzig on the army&#x27;s left flank. At the Battle of Friedland in 1807, Marshal Jean Lannes&#x27; corps was formed considerably from Poles, Saxons, and Dutch. For the first time, foreign troops had played a role in a major battle, and done so with distinction. During the War of the Fifth Coalition, as many as one-third of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, were from the Confederation of the Rhine, and one-quarter of the Army in Italy was Italian. At the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;″s peak in 1812, more than one-third of the troops that marched into Russia were non-French and represented 20 countries, including Austria and Prussia. General Julius von Grawert initially led the Prussian detachment, but was replaced by General Ludwig Yorck.

===Engineers===

While the glory of battle went to the cavalry, infantry, and artillery, the army also included military engineers of various types.

The bridge builders of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, the &quot;pontonniers&quot;, were an indispensable part of Napoleon&#x27;s military machine. Their main contribution was helping the emperor to get his forces across water obstacles by erecting pontoon bridges. The skills of his pontonniers allowed Napoleon to outflank enemy positions by crossing rivers where the enemy least expected and, in the case of the great retreat from Moscow, saved the army from complete annihilation at the Berezina River.

They may not have had the glory, but Napoleon clearly valued his &quot;pontonniers&quot; and had 14 companies commissioned into his armies, under the command of the brilliant engineer, General Jean Baptiste Eblé. His training, along with their specialized tools and equipment, enabled them to quickly build the various parts of the bridges, which could then be rapidly assembled and reused later. All the needed materials, tools, and parts were carried on their wagon trains. If they did not have a part or item, it could be quickly made using the mobile wagon-mounted forges of the &quot;pontonniers&quot;. A single company of &quot;pontonniers&quot; could construct a bridge of up to 80 pontoons (a span of some 120 to 150 metres long) in just under seven hours, an impressive feat even by today&#x27;s standards.

In addition to the &quot;pontonniers&quot;, there were companies of sappers, to deal with enemy fortifications. They were used far less often in their intended role than the &quot;pontonniers&quot;. However, since the emperor had learned in his early campaigns (such as the Siege of Acre) that it was better to bypass and isolate fixed fortifications, if possible, than to directly assault them, the sapper companies were usually put to other tasks.

The different types of engineer companies were formed into battalions and regiments called &quot;Génie&quot;, which was originally a slang term for engineer. This name, which is still used today, was both a play on the word (&quot;jeu de mot&quot;) and a reference to their seemingly magical abilities to grant wishes and make things appear much like the mythical Genie.

===Logistics===
One of Napoleon&#x27;s most quoted lines is his dictum that &quot;An army is a creature which marches on its stomach&quot;, illustrating the vital importance of military logistics. The troops of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; each carried four days&#x27; provisions. The supply wagon trains following them carried eight days&#x27;, but these were to be consumed only in emergency. One man was allotted to 750 grams of bread, 550 grams of biscuits, 250 grams of meat, 30 grams of rice, and 60 grams of grain; one litre of wine was shared between four men. Insofar as possible, Napoleon encouraged his men to live off the land through foraging and requisition of food (which was known as &quot;La Maraude&quot;). An integral part of the French logistics system was the inclusion in every regiment of several women known as &quot;cantinières&quot; (also known as &quot;vivandières&quot;, but &quot;cantinière&quot; was by far the more common term among French troops). These women were married to soldiers in their regiments, and acted as sutlers, selling food and drink (especially alcohol) to the troops. They were considered &quot;absolutely necessary&quot; to the functioning of the army, and the Consular Decree of 7 Thermidor, Year VIII set their number at four per battalion and two per cavalry squadron. These women fed the troops when all other logistical arrangements broke down.

Additional supplies would be stockpiled and stored at forward bases and depots which Napoleon would establish before the start of his campaigns. These would then be moved forward as the army advanced. The supply bases of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; would replenish the corps and divisional depots, which in turn would replenish the brigade and regimental supply trains, which would distribute rations and ammunition to the troops as needed to supplement their foraging. The reliance on foraging was sometimes determined by political pressures. When marching over friendly territory armies were told to &quot;live off what the country can supply&quot;, but when marching over neutral territory they were issued with supplies. It was this system of planned and improvised logistics which enabled the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; to sustain rapid marches of up to 15 miles per day for up to five weeks. The logistical system was also aided by a technological innovation in the form of the food preservation technique invented by Nicolas Appert, which led to modern canning methods.

===Medical Service===

The medical services had the least glory or prestige, but were required to deal with the full horrors of the war&#x27;s aftermath. The technology and practice of military medicine did not advance significantly during the Napoleonic Wars, but the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; did benefit from improvements in organisation and mobility. The established practice was for the wounded to be collected and treated after the battle had ended, by which time many wounded soldiers would have died. The systems adopted by the French Army in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period were the forerunners of almost all modern military ambulance and triage systems, being adopted by the armies of most other Western nations in the following decades.

The most significant innovation was the establishment of a system of &quot;ambulances volantes&quot; (flying ambulances) in the closing years of the 18th century by Dominique Jean Larrey (who would later become Surgeon-General of the Imperial Guard). His inspiration was the use of fast horse artillery, or &quot;flying artillery&quot;, which could manoeuver rapidly around the battlefield to provide urgent artillery support, or to escape an advancing enemy. The flying ambulance was designed to follow the advance guard and provide initial dressing of wounds (often under fire), while rapidly transporting the critically injured away from the battlefield. The personnel for a given ambulance team included a doctor, quartermaster, non-commissioned officer, a drummer boy (who carried the bandages), and 24 infantrymen as stretcher bearers.

Another French military surgeon, Baron L.P. Percy, implemented another system. He was the first to introduce &quot;a regularly trained corps of field litter bearers, soldiers regularly formed and equipped for the duty of picking up the wounded... and carrying them on stretchers to the place where means of surgical aid were provided&quot;. Percy&#x27;s system essentially served as a method of moving surgeons and their instruments closer to the engaged forces from where stretcher bearers would retrieve the wounded, rather than placing an emphasis on evacuating the wounded to the rear in a vehicle.

During the Napoleonic Wars, every French regiment, division, and corps had its own medical staff, consisting of ambulance units, orderlies to perform nursing duties, apothecaries, surgeons, and doctors. Larrey was instrumental in reorganising military hospitals and making them more mobile. This was more than any other army would be able to offer until the 1850s and 1860s, half a century later. Knowing that they would be promptly attended to, then honored and well looked after once back home, helped boost morale in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, and thus further contributed to its fighting abilities. The most revolutionary aspect of the system was Larrey&#x27;s attention to the wounded on both sides of the battlefield, a practice now enshrined in various Geneva Conventions. As stated in the &quot;Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène&quot;, &quot;The Emperor had only the highest praise for Dr Larrey, declaring that he left him with the image of a truly good man who combined all the virtues of effective philanthropy and science to the highest degree. Every wounded soldier was a member of his family. Larrey is the most virtuous man I have ever met.&quot;

Despite these innovations, conditions in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, as in all armies of the time, were primitive at best. Far more soldiers died of their wounds or from sickness than in battle (see Napoleonic Wars casualties). There was little knowledge of hygiene and nothing of antibiotics. The main surgical procedure was amputation. The only crude form of anaesthetic readily available was a strong alcoholic drink, or even, in some cases, knocking the patient unconscious. Opiates such as laudanum were occasionally available for pain control. Typically, only about two-thirds survived such an operation, but this number increased with swift attention.

Accounts of the ordeals of the wounded are horrific reading. Napoleon himself once noted, &quot;It requires more courage to suffer than to die&quot;, so he made sure those who did survive were given the best treatment available at hospitals in France, in particular Les Invalides, while they recuperated. The wounded survivours were often treated as heroes, awarded medals, pensions, and provided with prosthetic limbs if needed.

===Communications===
Most dispatches were conveyed as they had been for centuries, via messengers on horseback. Hussars, due to their bravery and riding skills, were often favoured for this task. Shorter range tactical signals could be sent visually by flags or audibly by drums, bugles, trumpets, and other musical instruments. Thus, standard bearers and musicians, in addition to their symbolic, ceremonial, and morale functions, also played important communication roles.

The &quot;Grande Armée&quot; did benefit from innovations made in long-range communications during the French Revolution. The French Army was among the first to employ homing pigeons as messengers in any large and organised manner, and also the first to use observation balloons for reconnaissance and communications. But the real advance for conveying long-range dispatches came in the form of an ingenious optical telegraph Semaphore system invented by Claude Chappe.

Chappe&#x27;s system consisted of an intricate network of small towers, within visual range of one another. On top of each was a 9-metre mast, with three large, movable wooden rods mounted on them. These rods, called the &quot;régulateur&quot; (regulator), were operated by trained crews using a series of pulleys and levers. The four basic positions of the rods could be combined to form 196 different &quot;signs&quot;. Provided with good crews of operators and decent visibility conditions, a sign could be sent through the 15 station towers between Paris and Lille, a distance of , in only 9 minutes, a complete message of 36 signs in about 32 minutes. From Paris to Venice, a message could be sent in only six hours.

Chappe&#x27;s telegraph soon became one of Napoleon&#x27;s favourite and most important secret weapons. A special portable version semaphore telegraph travelled with his headquarters. Using it, he was able to coordinate his logistics and forces over longer distances in far less time than his enemies. Work was even begun on a wagon-mounted version in 1812, but was not completed in time for use in the wars.

==Formations and tactics==

While Napoleon is best known as a master strategist and charismatic presence on the battlefield, he was also a tactical innovator. He combined classic formations and tactics that had been used for thousands of years with more recent ones, such as Frederick the Great&#x27;s &quot;Oblique Order&quot; (best illustrated at the Battle of Leuthen) and the &quot;mob tactics&quot; of the early &quot;Levée en masse&quot; armies of the Revolution. Napoleonic tactics and formations were highly fluid and flexible. In contrast, many of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;″s opponents were still wedded to a rigid system of &quot;Linear&quot; (or Line) tactics and formations, in which masses of infantry would simply line up and exchange vollies of fire, in an attempt to either blow the enemy from the field or outflank them. Due to the vulnerabilities of the line formations to flanking attacks, it was considered the highest form of military manoeuvre to outflank one&#x27;s adversary. Armies would often retreat or even surrender if this was accomplished. Consequently, commanders who adhered to this system would place a great emphasis on flank security, often at the expense of a strong centre or reserve. Napoleon would frequently take full advantage of this linear mentality by feigning flank attacks or offering the enemy his own flank as &quot;bait&quot; (best illustrated at the Battle of Austerlitz and also later at Lützen), then throw his main effort against their centre, split their lines, and roll up their flanks. He always kept a strong reserve as well, mainly in the form of his Imperial Guard, which could deliver a &quot;knockout blow&quot; if the battle was going well or turn the tide if it was not.

Some of the widely used and effective formations and tactics included:
* Line (&quot;Ligne&quot;): The basic three rank line formation, best used for delivering volley fire and was also a decent melee formation for infantry or cavalry, but it was relatively slow moving and vulnerable on the flanks.
* March Column (&quot;Colonne de Marche&quot;): The best formation for rapid or sustained movement of troops and a good melee attacking formation, but it offered little firepower and was also vulnerable to flank attack, ambush, artillery, and &quot;funneling&quot;.
* Wedge (&quot;Colonne de Charge&quot;): An arrow or spearhead shaped cavalry formation, designed to close rapidly and break the enemy&#x27;s line. Classic and effective mounted formation used throughout history, and still used by tanks today. But if the wedge was halted, or its attack lost momentum, then it was vulnerable to counter-pincer movements on its flanks.
* Attack Column (&quot;Colonne d&#x27;Attaque&quot;): A wide column of infantry, almost a hybrid of line and column, with light infantry skirmishers in front to disrupt the enemy and screen the column&#x27;s advance. Once the column closed, the skirmishers would move off to its flanks, then the column would fire a massed musket salvo and charge with their bayonets. An excellent formation against a standard, thin line. The Attack Column was developed from the &quot;Mob&quot; or &quot;Horde&quot; tactics of the early French Revolutionary Armies. Its disadvantages were a lack of massed firepower and vulnerability to artillery fire.
* Mixed Order (&quot;Ordre Mixte&quot;): Was Napoleon&#x27;s preferred infantry formation. Some units (usually regiments or battalions in size) would be placed in line formation, with other units in attack column behind and in between them. This combined the firepower of the line with the speed, melee, and skirmishing advantages of the attack column. It also had some of the disadvantages of both, so support from artillery and cavalry were especially vital for this tactic to succeed.
* Open Order (&quot;Ordre Ouvert&quot;): Foot and/or horse would spread out by unit and/or individually. This formation was best for light troops and skirmishers. It allowed for rapid movement, especially over broken or rough terrain such as hills or forests, and offered the best protection from enemy fire since the troops were spread out. Its disadvantages were it did not allow for massed or volley fire and was terrible for melee or close quarters fighting and thus, especially vulnerable to cavalry.
* Square (&quot;Carré&quot;): Classic infantry formation for defence against cavalry. Soldiers would form a hollow square at least three or four ranks deep on each side, with officers and artillery or cavalry in the middle. It offered infantry their best protection against charges, especially on good defensive terrain such as on the top or reverse slope of a hill. Squares were slow moving, almost stationary targets, however. This, along with their density, made squares very vulnerable to artillery and to a lesser extent, infantry fire. Once broken, squares tended to completely collapse.
* Flying Battery (&quot;Batterie Volante&quot;): Designed to take advantage of the French artillery&#x27;s mobility and training. A battery would move to one area on the field, lay down a short, sharp barrage, then rapidly redeploy to another area and fire another barrage, then quickly redeploy again, etc. The combined, cumulative effect of numerous batteries doing this all along the enemy&#x27;s lines could be devastating. The horse artillery were especially well suited for this tactic. Napoleon used it to great success in the early campaigns of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. Its flexibility allowed him to quickly mass well-aimed fire anywhere it was needed. But it required superbly trained and conditioned artillerymen and horses as well as close command, coordination, and control in order to work.
* Grand Battery (&quot;Grande Batterie&quot;): An alternative artillery tactic, when circumstances prohibited the flying batteries. Artillery would mass its fire at a single, crucial point on the battlefield (usually against the enemy&#x27;s centre). It could be devastating if the enemy was caught by surprise or in the open. But massing large numbers of guns in a single area without the enemy&#x27;s knowledge could be tricky. Once the battery opened fire and its target became clear, measures could be taken to avoid it. It was also vulnerable to counter-battery fire from enemy artillery and needed protection from cavalry attack. Although this has become the most well known French artillery tactic, Napoleon preferred the flying batteries and used it only when he had to or thought it posed a better chance of success. Often at the start of a battle, he would mass batteries into a large battery, then after a few salvoes, break it up into flying batteries. In the early campaigns it was rarely used, but as the quantity of the horses of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; and the quality of its artillerymen declined, Napoleon would be forced to employ it much more frequently in later battles.
* Boar&#x27;s Head (&quot;Tête du Sanglier&quot;): Another hybrid formation, somewhat like the mixed order, but combining all three arms into a wedge-like square, which could be used for assault or defence. Infantry would form a short, but thick, line many ranks deep on the front, which would be the boar&#x27;s &quot;snout&quot; (&quot;boutoir&quot;). Behind them would be two groups of artillery batteries or the &quot;eyes&quot; of the boar. On their flanks and behind them, in oblique order, would be other infantry in column, line, or square to form the boar&#x27;s &quot;face&quot;. Protecting their flanks and rear would be two groups of cavalry, which would serve as the boar&#x27;s &quot;tusk&quot;. This was a highly complex formation, which could not be formed as easily or quickly as the others. Once formed, except for the tusks, it had slow mobility. It was, however, faster moving than the traditional square and less vulnerable to artillery or infantry fire. The &quot;tusks&quot; also gave it stronger offensive capabilities. It would later be employed to great effect during the French conquests in North Africa during the 1830s and 1840s, and would be used up until the 1920s.

==Ranks of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;==

&quot;Maréchal d&#x27;Empire&quot;, or Marshal of the Empire, was not a rank within the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, but a personal title granted to distinguished divisional generals, along with higher pay and privileges. The same applied to the corps commanders (&quot;General de Corps d&#x27;armee&quot;) and army commanders (&quot;General en chef&quot;). The highest permanent rank in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was actually &quot;Général de division&quot; and those higher than it were positions of the same rank but with separate insignia for appointment holders. The position of Colonel General of a branch (such as dragoons or grenadiers of the Guard) was akin to Chief Inspector-General of that branch, whose office holder used his current officer rank and its corresponding insignia.

According to Alain Pigeard, between 1792 and 1814 no fewer than 190 foreign-born soldiers, that is, around 6 per cent of the French Army&#x27;s senior officers, were promoted to general, including Józef Poniatowski, who was appointed Marshal of the Empire during the Battle of Leipzig (1813), only to die less than 48 hours later.

<text>Pierre de Bourdeille (,  – 15 July 1614), called the seigneur et abbé de Brantôme, was a French memoirist, soldier and biographer.

==Life==
Born at Bourdeilles in the Périgord, Brantôme was the third son of the baron François de Bourdeille and Anne de Vivonne. His mother and maternal grandmother, Louise de Daillon du Lude, were both attached to the court of Marguerite of Navarre. After Marguerite&#x27;s death (1549), Brantôme went to Paris and later to Poitiers (1555) to finish his education. He was a nephew of Jeanne de Dampierre, who belonged to the royal household and whom he cited as a source of information in his works.

He was given several benefices, the most important of which was the lay abbacy of Saint-Pierre de Brantôme, but had no inclination for an ecclesiastical career. He became a soldier and came into contact with many of the great leaders of the continental wars. He travelled in Italy; in Scotland, where he accompanied Mary, Queen of Scots (then the widow of Francis II of France); in England, where he saw Elizabeth I (1561, 1579); in Morocco, where he took part in Don García de Toledo&#x27;s conquest of Badis (1564); and in Spain and Portugal.

Brantôme fought on the galleys of the Order of Malta, and accompanied his great friend, the French commander Filippo di Piero Strozzi, in the latter&#x27;s expedition to Terceira, in which Strozzi was killed (1582). During the Wars of Religion under Charles IX, he fought for the Catholics (including at the siege of La Rochelle), but he allowed himself to be won over temporarily by the ideas of the Huguenot reformers. Though he publicly separated himself from Protestantism, it had a marked effect on his mind.

A fall from his horse compelled him to retire into private life about 1589, and he spent his last years in writing his &quot;Memoirs&quot; of the illustrious men and women whom he had known.

His life was the subject of the historical drama film &quot;Dames galantes&quot; (1990) that focused on his relations with women. The lead role was played by Richard Bohringer.

== Memoirs ==
De Bourdeille left distinct orders that his manuscript should be printed; a first edition appeared late (1665–1666) and not very complete. Later editions include:
*one in 15 volumes (1740)
*another by Louis Jean Nicolas Monmerque (1780–1860) in 8 volumes (1821–1824), reproduced in Buchon&#x27;s &quot;Pantheon littéraire&quot;
*that of the&quot; Bibliothèque elzevirienne&quot;, begun (1858) by Prosper Mérimée and L. Lacour, and finished, with vol. xiii., only in 1893
*and Ludovic Lalanne&#x27;s edition for the Société de l&#x27;histoire de France (12 vols, 1864–1896).

De Bourdeille can hardly be regarded as a historian proper, and his &quot;Memoirs&quot; cannot be accepted as a very trustworthy source of information. But he writes in a quaint conversational way, pouring forth his thoughts, observations or facts without order or system, and with the greatest frankness.

His works give a picture of the general court-life of the time, with its unblushing and undisguised profligacy. There is not an &quot;homme illustre&quot; or a &quot;dame galante&quot; in all his gallery of portraits who has not engaged in sexual immorality; and yet the whole is narrated with the most complete unconsciousness that there is anything objectionable in their conduct.

The work was published in two volumes by the Golden Cockerel Press under the title &quot;The Lives of the Gallant Ladies&quot; in 1924 with woodcuts by Robert Gibbings.

<text>Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec (1485 – 15 August 1528) was a French military leader. As Marshal of France, he commanded the campaign to conquer Naples, but died from the bubonic plague in 1528.

==Biography==
Odet was the son of Jean de Foix-Lautrec and Jeanne d&#x27;Aydie. He and his two brothers, the seigneur de Lescun and the seigneur de l&#x27;Esparre or Asparros, served Francis I of France as captains; and the influence of their sister, Françoise de Châteaubriant, who became the king&#x27;s mistress, gained them high office.

In 1516, as marshal of France, Odet was made governor-general of the Milanese duchy, but his severity made the French occupation insupportable. He was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold being in Francis I&#x27;s royal entourage.

Odet arrived to resume the siege of Brescia, and on 26 May 1521, the Spanish and German garrison surrendered. The surrender was caused by the dissonance between the two factions, while Brescia was given over to Venetian commissioner, Andrea Gritti. In 1521 he succeeded in defending the Milan against the Spanish army. In 1522, under pressure from unpaid Swiss troops, Odet attacked entrenched Spanish-Imperial positions and was completely defeated at the Battle of Bicocca, losing Milan in the process. Odet fled back to France, and supervised the hostage exchange of Francis&#x27; sons following the latter&#x27;s defeat at Battle of Pavia.

Sometime after his wife&#x27;s death, Odet married Jeanne de Croy. In 1527 he received command of the army to conquer the kingdom of Naples. The defection of Andrea Doria and an outbreak of the plague or cholera in the French camp brought on a fresh disaster. Odet himself caught a disease and died on 17 August 1528.

==Marriage==
Odet married Charlotte d&#x27;Albret (1495–1527) in 1520. They had:

* Gaston (1522–1528)
* Henry (1523–1540)
* Claude (died 1549)
* Francis (died 1528)

<text>Andrea Doria, Prince of Melfi (; ; 30 November 146625 November 1560) was an Italian statesman, &quot;&quot;, and admiral, who played a key role in the Republic of Genoa during his lifetime.

From 1528 until his death, Doria exercised a predominant influence in the councils of the Genoese republic, and was considered the foremost naval leader in Europe at his time. He became Holy Roman Emperor Charles V&#x27;s grand admiral, a position he employed both to protect Genoa&#x27;s independence and to maintain his own control over the city. He also acted as a privateer with the ships he owned in order to increase his wealth. His fleet helped secure the imperial naval lines between Spain and Italy, although he had a mixed success against the eminent threat of the Ottoman navy.

As the ruler of Genoa, Doria reformed the Republic&#x27;s constitution. Originally elected for life, the Doge&#x27;s office was reduced to two years. At the same time, plebeians were declared ineligible, and the appointment of the doge was entrusted to the members of the great and the little councils. His reformed constitution of the Republic of Genoa would last until the end of the republic in 1797.

Several ships were named in honour of the admiral, the most famous being the Italian passenger liner , launched in 1951, which sank following a collision in 1956.

==Early life==

Doria was born at Oneglia from the ancient Genoese family the Doria di Oneglia, a branch of the noble Doria family, who played a major role in the history of the Republic since the 12th century. His parents were related: Ceva Doria, co-lord of Oneglia, and Caracosa Doria, of the Doria di Dolceacqua branch. Orphaned at an early age, he became a soldier of fortune, serving first in the papal guard and then under various Italian princes.

==In the service of France==
In 1503, he fought in Corsica in the service of the Genoese Navy, at that time under French vassalage. However, after the Battle of Ravenna of 1512, he turned against the Francophile government of Genoa represented by Gian Fregoso. With 46, despite having no previous naval experience, Doria was appointed admiral and took upon him reorganizing the existent Genoese fleet. A French invasion of Genoa forced him and his fleet to escape to La Spezia. With the French defeat in Novara the following year, Doria returned and conquered the local French garrison in Briglia, expelled them from Genoa and helped Ottaviano Fregoso to become the new Doge.

Doria also scoured the Mediterranean in command of the Genoese fleet, waging war on the Turks and the Barbary pirates. When a fleet led by the brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa, coming from a failed siege of the Spanish port of Béjaïa, captured a Genoese ship in 1512, Doria attacked the brothers&#x27; base in La Goulette with twelve galleys, sacking the place and destroying the ships in port. In the meanwhile, however, Genoa was recaptured by the French, as a new change of tide in Marignano forced Fregoso to pledge Genoa to King Francis I of France in 1515. Doria focused in his actions against Muslims, defeated another Turk fleet in at Pianosa in 1519.

===Italian Wars===
In 1522, during the Italian War between France and the empire of Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, Genoa was conquered and sacked by imperial troops under the command of Prospero Colonna and Fernando d&#x27;Ávalos, forcing Doria to escape with the fleet again. Taking refuge in Monaco, he helped the French defend Marseille, but the war came to an abrupt end when Francis I was captured by the imperial army in Pavia. Doria prepared a plan to try to rescue him, but Francis ordered him to refrain.

Doria then clashed with Francis&#x27; regent, Anne de Montmorency, and abandoned French service, forming a naval mercenary fleet. However, he ended up siding with France again when Pope Clement VIII formed the League of Cognac to oppose Charles V, for which Doria was hired to command their armada while Giovanni delle Bande Nere did the same in their land army. Doria defeated a bigger Spanish fleet in Corsica and planned to conquer Genoa, still under imperial rule, but it was never carried on. With Giovanni&#x27;s death in action and the sack of Rome by mutinied imperial troops, the situation worsened for the League of Cognac, who depended on Doria more than ever.

In 1528, the League&#x27;s armada, under the command of Doria and his nephew, Filippino Doria, crushed a Spanish fleet on 28 April 1528 at the Battle of Capo d&#x27;Orso, capturing the enemy commanders Alfonso d&#x27;Avalos and Ascanio Colonna. However, Andrea became dissatisfied with his treatment at the hands of Francis, who was mean about payment and replaced Doria for the French admiral Antoine de La Rochefoucauld. Meanwhile, d&#x27;Avalos capitalized on the chance to try convince Doria to switch sides, with Doria refusing to hand d&#x27;Avalos and Colonna to Francis as the king asked. Charles V and Doria exchanged letters, and although Francis found about it and attempted to compensate the Genoese, the latter deserted the French for the emperor on June 1528.

==In the service of Charles V==

Without Doria&#x27;s fleet, the League collapsed. The Genoese lifted the siege of Naples, chasing La Rochefoucauld until Provence and capturing four of his ships. In September, Doria and his forces drove the French out of Genoa and were triumphantly received by the city. Charles appointed him grand admiral, prince of Melfi and Marquis of Tursi in reward for his services. He found Doria an invaluable ally in the wars with Francis I, and through him extended his domination over the whole of Italy. He continued to serve the emperor in various wars, in which he was generally successful and always active.

===Ruling the Genoese republic===
Doria reformed the constitution in an aristocratic sense, eliminating the factions that had plagued the republic in the past centuries, and constituted a new oligarchic form of government composed of the city’s principal aristocratic families, creating 28 Alberghi or &quot;clans&quot;. The 28 Alberghi that formed this new ruling class included the Cybo, Doria, Fieschi, Giustiniani, Grimaldi, Imperiale, Pallavicino, and Spinola families.

He refused offers to take the lordship of Genoa and even the dogeship, but accepted the position of &quot;perpetual censor&quot;, and exercised predominant influence in the councils of the republic until his death. The title &quot;censor&quot; in this context was modelled on its meaning in the Roman Republic, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a highly respected senior public official (see Roman censor), rather than its modern meaning having to do with censorship. He was given two palaces, many privileges, and the title of (Liberator and Father of His Country). He established himself in his newly-renovated villa in Fassolo, a Renaissance masterpiece known as Villa del Principe, in an area just outside the now demolished Porta di San Tomaso, where he resided until his death.

To protect the restored republic from future foreign attacks, Andrea Doria sponsored the construction of a new city wall, which was built in the third decade of the sixteenth century, on a design by the military engineer Giovanni Maria Olgiati. This new city wall actually followed the path of the previous 14th-century walls but replaced the old square-plan towers and walls with new curtain-shaped curtain walls and triangular bastions.

===War against the Ottoman Empire===
Actions against the Ottomans and Barbary pirates occupied again much of Doria&#x27;s time. In 1529, Spanish captain Rodrigo de Portundo was defeated by Aydin and Salih, lieutenants of Hayreddin Barbarossa. With hired French mercenaries, Doria launched an attack on Cherchell, Barbarossa&#x27;s protectorate, sacking the port and freeing 800 Christian prisoners, although the mercenaries&#x27; undiscipline drove him abandon them to their fate when his fleet had to sail off before the Turk&#x27;s arrival.

In summer 1532, in response to the Turk invasion of Hungary in April, Andrea attacked the Ottoman positions in the Aegean Sea with a Spanish-Genoese fleet of 48 galleys and 35 vessels. He headed to Morea, capturing Corone by way of a novel system of cannons and ladders in his masts to assault the coastal bulwark. Doria followed by taking and sacking Patras, destroying fortresses around the Gulf of Corinth, and reached to the Dardanelles. Doria returned to Genoa with booty of 60.000 ducats, having helped to force the Ottomans abort a possible conquest of Hungary.

The Ottomans attempted to recover Corone the following year with a 110-ship armada captained by Lütfi Pasha. Doria rendzvoused in Messina with Álvaro de Bazán the Elder, gathering together 27 galleys and 30 ships, and lifted the siege. Doria defeated Lufti despite its numbers, outmaneuvering the Turks with his galleys despite absence of wind having becalmed his other ships, and losing only three galleys in the battle. The relief of Corone would be called by Edmond Jurien de La Gravière one of the most skillful naval operations of the 16th century.

Barbarossa, now turned into grand admiral of the Ottoman Empire, launched his own offensive from Constantinople with 80 galleys and French support, sacking around Naples and Sicily. In 1535, Charles V called for the conquest of Tunis, which Barbarossa had just conquered and made his base. The fleet, with Doria sharing main command with Bazán the Elder, succeeded in taking Tunis and capturing Barbarossa&#x27;s entire 42-ship fleet, although the corsair managed to escape. Doria persecuted Barbarosa to Bona, which the Genoese stormed, but Barbarossa had fled and taken refuge in Algiers. Charles intended to continue the campaign taking Algiers next, but the weather impeded it.

===Italian War of 1536-1538===
After the death of Francesco I Sforza death in 1535, Charles V and Francis I clashed again for the succession of the Duchy of Milan. Doria was vital for the emperor to secure the friendship of the Médicis of Florence, favoring the ascension of Cosimo I. Doria and Bazán the Elder captured cities along the French Riviera, although stopping in Marseille. Shortly after, Babarossa attacked and sacked the Balearic Islands with 27 galleasses he gathered in Algiers, leading Doria to give him chase unsuccessfully with 30 galleys, with orders of Charles V to bring the Turk privateer dead or alive. In a shocking move, Francis allied with the Ottomans in 1536, installing Barbarossa with a Franco-Turk fleet in Marseille, although the defenses built by Doria dissuaded them from trying to take Genoa.

In April 1537, Barbarossa appeared in front of Italy with 170 ships, but he had come to negotiate, and through a Spanish prisoner he proposed the emperor a possible desertion of the Ottoman Empire, citing his enmity with Lütfi and the political turmoil after the killing of Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha. Nothing came from it.

In July, due to the outbreak of the Ottoman–Venetian War, Doria sailed off at the head of 28 galleys from Messina. He captured a fleet of 10 Ottoman supply ships, after which he faced off with Ali Zelif and his 12 galleys near Paxos. Doria took all of his vessels, while Zelif died in the battle. Upon finding out Barbarossa was now coming for him with a huge fleet of 135 galleys to avenge the defeat, Doria retreated to Messina, where he was forced to hear how Barbarossa sacked Apulia. The Ottomans boasted they might be able to choose their own Pope some day, although in reality their fleet had to be diverted against Venice. After finally gathering 100 ships, Doria marched to lift the Turk siege of the Venetian colony of Corfu, but the Ottomans had lifted it themselves.

In February 1538, Pope Paul III called for peace among the Christians and the formation of a Holy League (comprising the Papal States, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, the Republic of Venice, and the Maltese Knights) against the Turks. Although Francis did not join, the Italian War came to its end with the Truce of Nice, and he accepted to break his alliance with the Ottomans.

===Holy League===
In 1538, being given command of the Holy League, Doria sailed off with 80 Venetian galleys, 36 from the Vatican States, 30 from Spain, as well as 50 naos, with the goal to seek the encounter with Barbarossa&#x27;s fleet and defeated him. He tracked Barbarossa and his lieutenants, which included Sinan, Salah and Dragut or Turgut Reis, to the strait of Corinth, where he blockaded them. However, infighting within the League or inscrutable orders on Doria&#x27;s part, depending on the sources, caused the rout of their fleet in the subsequent Battle of Preveza in September 1538. This victory secured Turkish dominance over the eastern Mediterranean for the next 33 years, until the Battle of Lepanto in 1571.

Doria was harshly criticized for his lack of strategy, which might have obeyed to Spain and Genoa being unwilling to commit themselves in defense of the politically distant Venice, not any less to the fact that Doria owned many of the ships employed. To compensate the defeat, they captured Castelnuovo, but Charles and Venice argued about who would keep the place, causing the practical disbandment of the Holy League. The garrison, initially conceived as the beachhead of an invasion of the Ottoman Balkans, was besieged and defeated by Barbarossa in the notorious Siege of Castelnuovo.

In 1540, his nephew Giannettino Doria obtained a big victory in the Battle of Girolata, capturing Dragut, the most eminent Turkish captain other than Babarossa. Andrea had him as a galley slave in his flagship during four years. Around this time, an usual partner to Doria, Bernardino de Mendoza, achieved another victory over Ottoman privateers in the Battle of Alborán.

Andrea, Giannettino and Mendoza were recruited by Charles V in 1541 to launch an expedition to Algiers, a new attempt to capture Barbarossa. Doria tried to warn the emperor of the terrible timing of the move, as it was autumn and the Mediterranean weather was dangerous, but he was not heeded, and the Genoese reluctantly accepted to participate anyways. The result was a fiasco, as a storm disintegrated he imperial fleet, although the Dorias managed to secure the rereat of a large part of the fleet, taking a large effort to reorganize the other Genoese captains.

===Italian War of 1542-1546===
In 1542, the now allied French and Ottomans sacked Nice, being chased away by Doria, who captured four ships. In May, Hayreddin Barbarossa attacked Reggio with 110 galleys, linking with the French fleet in Marseille, where command was shared with Francis of Bourbon. Again, Barbarossa and Bourbon conquered and sacked Nice, except by its citadel, and retreated with the arrival of Doria, who disembarked a land army led by Alfonso d&#x27;Avalos in Villefranche. Nice was recovered, while the Franco-Turk fleet moved to Antibes. Meanwhile, Bazán the Elder destroyed the French Atlantic fleet in Muros Bay, where his son Álvaro de Bazán was present.

To great outrage of Christendom, in 1544 Doria freed Dragut in exchange for a rich rescue of 3,000 ducats paid by Barbarossa, who had also threatened with blockading Genoa. Doria was probably trying to gain the Ottomans&#x27; sympathy in the case one of his own relatives was captured, although he eventually repented his decision due to Dragut&#x27;s many future successes. The Genoese then advised d&#x27;Avalos not to look for a direct battle against the French, but due to the bad state of their relationship, d&#x27;Avalos rebuked him and did it nonetheless, being defeated in Ceresole. Doria helped impeding the French from capitalizing on the chance, attacking the French positions in the coast.

After the Peace of Crépy between Francis and Charles in 1544, Doria hoped to end his days in quiet. However, his great wealth and power, as well as the arrogance of his nephew and heir Giannettino Doria, had made him many enemies, and in 1547 the Fieschi conspiracy to dislodge his family from power took place. Giannettino was killed, but the conspirators were defeated, and Doria showed great vindictiveness in punishing them, seizing many of their fiefs for himself. He was also implicated in the murder of Pier Luigi Farnese, duke of Parma and Piacenza, who had helped Fieschi.

===Later years===

Other conspiracies followed, of which the most important was that of Giulio Cybo (1548), but all failed. Although Doria was ambitious and harsh, he was a patriot and successfully opposed Emperor Charles&#x27;s repeated attempts to have a citadel built in Genoa and garrisoned by Spaniards; neither blandishments nor threats could win him over to the scheme.

Nor did age lessen his energy, for in 1550, aged 84, he again put to sea to confront the Muslim armadas, as although Barbarossa had retired in 1545, Dragut and the Barbary pirates continued being a threat. Doria and Mendoza captured Mahdia, which Dragut had recently conquered as his headquarters. In the citadel they captured Hesar, a nephew to Dragut himself. Doria reinforced the garrison the next year, after which he found and chased Turgut and his 20 galleys to Djerba, blockading the privateer with few ships in an inlet. Dragut still escaped, digging a channel and dragging his ships overland to it. Disgruntled, Doria sacked Djerba.

In 1552, a 100-galley Ottoman fleet under the command of Dragut ambushed 40 Spanish and Genoese transport galleys commanded by Doria in the Ponza, although Doria managed to escape losing only seven of them. The war between France and the Empire having broken out once more, the French invaded Corsica, then administered by the Genoese Bank of Saint George. Doria was again summoned, and he spent two years (1553–1555) on the island fighting the French with varying fortune.

He returned to Genoa for good in 1555, and being very old and infirm, he gave over the command of the galleys to his great-nephew Giovanni Andrea Doria, the son of Giannettino Doria, who conducted an expedition against Tripoli, but proved even more unsuccessful than his great-uncle had been at Algiers, barely escaping with his life after losing the Battle of Djerba against the Turkish fleet of Piyale Pasha and Turgut Reis. Andrea Doria left his estates to Giovanni Andrea. The family of Doria-Pamphili-Landi is descended from Giovanni Andrea Doria and bears his title of Prince of Melfi.

==Ships==

<doc id="308093" wikidata="Q331209" url="?curid=308093" title="Theodore Sedgwick">
<text>Theodore Sedgwick (May 9, 1746January 24, 1813) was an American attorney, politician, and jurist who served in elected state government and as a delegate to the Continental Congress, a U.S. representative, and a senator from Massachusetts. He served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate from June to December 1798. He also served as the fourth speaker of the United States House of Representatives. He was appointed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1802 and served there for the rest of his life.

==Early life and education==
Born in West Hartford in the Connecticut Colony, Sedgwick was the son of Benjamin Sedgwick (1716–1755). His paternal immigrant ancestor Major General Robert Sedgwick arrived in 1636 in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, as part of the Great Migration.

Sedgwick attended Yale College, where he studied theology and law. He did not graduate, but continued in his study of law (to &quot;read law&quot;) under the attorney Mark Hopkins of Great Barrington. Hopkins was the grandfather of the Mark Hopkins who later became president of Williams College.

==Early career==
Sedgwick was admitted to the bar in 1766 and commenced practice in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Among the prospective attorneys who learned the law in his office was Stephen Jacob, who later served on the Vermont Supreme Court. He moved to Sheffield. During the American Revolutionary War, he served in the Continental Army as a major, and took part in the expedition to Canada and the Battle of White Plains in 1776.

==Freedom suit==
As a relatively young lawyer, Sedgwick and Tapping Reeve pleaded the case of &quot;Brom and Bett vs. Ashley&quot; (1781), an early &quot;freedom suit&quot;, in county court for the slaves Elizabeth Freeman (known as Bett) and Brom. Bett was a black slave who had escaped from her master, Colonel John Ashley of Sheffield, Massachusetts, because of cruel treatment by his wife. Brom joined her in suing for freedom from the Ashleys. The attorneys challenged their enslavement under the new state constitution of 1780, which held that &quot;all men are born free and equal.&quot; The jury agreed and ruled that Bett and Brom were free. The decision was upheld on appeal by the state Supreme Court.

Bett marked her freedom by taking the name of Elizabeth Freeman, and she chose to work for wages at the Sedgwick household, where she helped rear their several children. She worked there for much of the rest of her life, buying a separate house for her and her daughter after the Sedgwick children were grown. After Freeman&#x27;s death, the Sedgwicks buried her at Stockbridge Cemetery in the Sedgwick Pie, the family plot. The family marked Freeman&#x27;s grave with an inscribed monument, and it is beside that of their fourth child, writer Catharine Maria.

==Political career==
A Federalist, Sedgwick began his political career in 1780 as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was elected as representative to the state house, and then as state senator. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.

In 1789 Sedgwick was elected as Representative to Congress from Massachusetts&#x27; first congressional district, and also unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate that year. Over time also represented Massachusetts&#x27; second district, serving until 1796. That year he was elected to the United States Senate, and served until 1799. In 1799 he was re-elected as a Representative, this time from the fourth district, and was elected the fifth Speaker of the House, serving until March 1801.

In 1802, Sedgwick was appointed a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. He held the position until his death.

===Political relationship with John Adams===
Sedgwick was nine years younger than John Adams, a 1780 delegate to the Second Continental Congress, attorney and state and federal politician. Sedgwick greatly admired Adams and worked for his election to the presidency in 1796. He was present at Adams&#x27; swearing-in as President on March 4, 1797, then serving as a U.S. Senator representing Massachusetts. Sedgwick called Adams&#x27; inauguration &quot;the most august and sublime&quot; event that he ever attended. However, certain policy disputes arose during Adams&#x27; administration, including Adams&#x27; efforts to avoid an escalation of war with France that included sending a group of emissaries to Paris in order to negotiate a lasting peace treaty to end the undeclared Quasi-War between the two countries from 1798 to 1800. When Sedgwick learned of the appointment and mission of the emissaries, &quot;he wrote of the &#x27;vain, jealous, and half frantic mind&#x27; of John Adams, a man ruled &#x27;by caprice alone.&#x27;&quot;

Despite the differences between them, starting on the morning of March 4, 1801, the last day of Adams&#x27; term as President and the day after Sedgwick&#x27;s retirement as Speaker of the U.S. House, Sedgwick and Adams rode together on the carriage trip from Washington, D.C. to Massachusetts.

==Marriages and family==

Around 1767, Sedgwick married Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; Mason, the daughter of a deacon from Franklin, Connecticut. In 1771, Sedgwick contracted smallpox which he passed on to his wife who was then pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child. She died of the disease on April 12, 1771 while eight months pregnant.

Sedgwick married a second time on April 17, 1774 to Pamela Dwight of the New England Dwight family. She was the daughter of Brigadier General Joseph Dwight of Great Barrington and his second wife, the widow Abigail Williams Sargent. Abigail was the daughter of Colonel Ephraim Williams, and half-sister of Ephraim Williams, Jr., the founder of Williams College.

The Sedgwicks had ten children, three of which died within a year of birth, reflecting the high infant mortality rate of the time. They were:
# Elizabeth Mason Sedgwick (April 30, 1775 – October 15, 1827)
# A child died at birth on March 27, 1777.
# Frances Pamela Sedgwick (May 6, 1778 – June 20, 1842)
# Theodore Sedgwick II (December 9, 1780 – 1839) married children&#x27;s book author Susan Anne Livingston. Their son, Theodore Sedgwick, was a lawyer and author.
# Catherine Sedgwick (July 11, 1782 – March 3, 1783)
# Henry Dwight Sedgwick (April 18, 1784 – March 1, 1785)
# Henry Dwight Sedgwick (September 22, 1785 – December 23, 1831), his grandson was a lawyer and an author Henry Dwight Sedgwick III.
# Robert Sedgwick (June 6, 1787 – September 2, 1841) was a lawyer who married Elizabeth Dana Ellery, granddaughter of William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.
# Catharine Maria Sedgwick (December 28, 1789 – July 31, 1876) became one of the first noted female writers in the United States.
# Charles Sedgwick (December 15, 1791 – August 3, 1856), became clerk of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. His grandson was anatomist Charles Sedgwick Minot.

During the marriage, Sedgwick frequently left his wife and children at their home in Stockbridge, Massachusetts while he focused on building his political career. His frequent absences, coupled with the death of three children and the strain of caring for numerous children (albeit with the help of her mother and many servants and slaves), caused Pamela&#x27;s physical and mental health to decline. After Pamela&#x27;s mother died in February 1791, she developed depression and began exhibiting signs of hypomania. She was institutionalized for a time in December 1795, but her physical and mental health continued to decline in the years following her release. She committed suicide by consuming poison on September 20, 1807.

Approximately eight months after Pamela&#x27;s death, Sedgwick announced his intention to marry Penelope Russell. Russell was the eldest of ten children (six of whom died) of Dr. Charles and Elizabeth (née Vassall) Russell. Charles Russell was a Harvard University educated doctor who, in 1771, was appointed as registrar to the Vice Admiralty Court. Elizabeth Vassall&#x27;s father Henry had been a prominent planter in Jamaica and had left his children a sizable inheritance. The Russells and Vassalls were staunch Loyalists who sought asylum in England and Antigua during the Revolutionary War. Sedgwick and Russell met when he represented her uncle, William Vassall, in an equity case he brought against the state of Massachusetts to win back homes and land the state confiscated during the war.

Sedgwick&#x27;s children were horrified and hurt that their father planned to marry so quickly after the death of their mother, Pamela. They also did not approve of “Miss Russell” whom they considered a spendthrift who was only interested in the Sedgwick fortune. Against his children&#x27;s wishes, Sedgwick married Russell on November 7, 1808 at King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston. None of Sedgwick&#x27;s children were informed of the wedding and did not attend.
Theodore Sedgwick and Penelope Russell remained married until Sedgwick&#x27;s death in January 1813.

==Slave ownership==
According to research conducted by The Washington Post in 2022 and the Massachusetts Historical Society, Sedgwick owned at least one slave. A July 1, 1777 bill of sale shows General John Fellows sold a woman by the name of Ton to the 30-year old Sedgwick.

==Death==
While on his death bed, Sedgwick converted to Unitarianism with his daughter Catharine Maria and William Ellery Channing in attendance. On January 24, 1813, Sedgwick died in Boston, Massachusetts at the age of 66. He was buried in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. His grave is at the center of the &quot;Sedgwick Pie&quot;.

==Contributing descendants to recent and present eras==
Theodore Sedgwick was the great-grandfather of Ellery Sedgwick, owner and publisher of the Atlantic Monthly 1908–1938;  third great-grandfather of Edie Sedgwick, 1965 &quot;superstar&quot; in Andy Warhol&#x27;s celebrity world;  is the same to present author John Sedgwick;  and is fourth great-grandfather to Kyra Sedgwick and Robert Sedgwick, actors.

<doc id="308094" wikidata="Q984974" url="?curid=308094" title="Bude">
<text>Bude (, locally or ; Cornish ) is a seaside town in north Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, in the civil parish of Bude-Stratton and at the mouth of the River Neet (also known locally as the River Strat). It was sometimes formerly known as Bude Haven. It lies southwest of Stratton, south of Flexbury and Poughill, and north of Widemouth Bay, located along the A3073 road off the A39. Bude is twinned with Ergué-Gabéric in Brittany, France. Bude&#x27;s coast faces Bude Bay in the Celtic Sea, part of the Atlantic Ocean. At the 2021 census, the built-up area of the town had a population of 7,342. The population of the civil parish can be found under Bude-Stratton.

Its earlier importance was as a harbour, and then a source of sea sand useful for improving the inland soil. This was transported on the Bude Canal. The Victorians favoured it as a seaside resort. With new rail links, it became a popular seaside destination in the 20th century. Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide of 1866, Section 2, described Bude as: &quot;a small port and picturesque village in the north-eastern extremity of Cornwall&quot;. It described the town as having the dignity of a fashionable marine resort with excellent facilities for bathers. The harbour bed consists of fine bright yellow sand consisting of small shells. &quot;The sea view is of a striking, bold and sublime description – the rocks rising on every side to lofty broken elevations&quot;. It also describes Bude as a romantic retreat.

==Geography==
Bude lies just west of Stratton and north of Widemouth Bay and is located along the A3073 road off the A39 road. The section of the A39 running through Bude is known as the Atlantic Highway.

===Coastline===
A section of Bude&#x27;s coast which is located between Compass Cove to the south and Furzey Cove to the north, is a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) noted for its geological and biological interest. Part of the land designated as the Bude Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest is owned by the National Trust. Carboniferous sandstone cliffs surround Bude. During the Variscan Orogeny the strata were heavily faulted and folded. As the sands and cliffs around Bude contain calcium carbonate (a natural fertiliser), farmers used to take sand from the beach, for spreading on their fields. The cliffs around Bude are the only ones in Cornwall that are made of Carboniferous sandstone, as most of the Cornish coast is formed of Devonian slate, granite and Precambrian metamorphic rocks. The stratified cliffs of Bude give their name to a sequence of rocks called the Bude Formation. Many formations can be viewed from the South West Coast Path which passes through the town.

Many ships have been wrecked on the jagged reefs which fringe the base of the cliffs. The figurehead of one of these, the &quot;Bencoolen&quot;, a barque whose wrecking in 1862 resulted in the drowning of most of the crew, was preserved in the churchyard but was transferred to the town museum to save it from further decay. The aftermath of the wreck of the &quot;Bencoolen&quot; was described by Robert Stephen Hawker in letters which were published in Hawker&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Works&quot; (1879).

===Climate===
Like the rest of the British Isles and South West England, Bude experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. Temperature extremes at the Met Office weather station at Bude range from during February 1969 to in July 2022. The Met Office recorded Bude as the sunniest place in the United Kingdom during the summer of 2013 with 783 hours of sunlight.
==History and description==

Bude-Stratton is said to have been a settlement since the Bronze Age but nothing remains of it.

Efford Manor, seat of the Arundell family of Trerice, was the only building here in the Middle Ages. Bude or Porthbud was known as Bede&#x27;s Haven, the &#x27;chapel&#x27; or &#x27;hermitage&#x27; on the rock, Bede being the holy man who lived there, on what is now the breakwater. The original breakwater was destroyed in 1838 by a terrible storm, while the newer version was constructed in 1839. The spectacular sandstone coast here is a Site of Specific Scientific Interest, known for jagged reefs, implicated in many past shipwrecks. Alongside the sea and by the canal runs the river Neet (or Strat). The two halves of the town are connected by Nanny Moore&#x27;s bridge, a grade two listed building, named after a 19th-century ‘dipper’ who lived nearby. Beyond this lay the quay, rebuilt in 1577 with funds from the Blanchminster charity.

The river divided the land owned by two Cornish families. South of the river was owned by Sir John Arundell, while land to the north was owned by Sir Richard Grenville of Stowe Barton, Kilkhampton. During the 1700-1800s, Bude was a thriving port used by smaller vessels. Over time, the land changed hands – the Grenville land passed to the Carterets/Thynnes while the Arundell land passed to the Aclands. Bude and neighbouring Stratton are relevant in the English Civil War, with Nanny Moore&#x27;s Bridge featuring as a passe over the river for the Royalists.

===Victorian resort===

Bude became popular in Victorian times for sea bathing, inspired by the Romantic movement. The ladies used Crooklets Beach while the gentlemen were segregated to Summerleaze. Workers flocked to Bude for the building of the canal, but as shipping dwindled, and the railway reached dominance, Bude concentrated on the emergent tourist trade. By 1926, there were 59 boarding houses and 5 hotels: the Falcon, Grenville, Globe, Norfolk and the Commercial.

===Beaches===

There are a number of good beaches in the Bude area, many of which offer good surfing conditions and many of which are dog-friendly. Bude Lifeboat Station is at Summerleaze beach. Bude was the founder club in British Surf Life Saving.
* Summerleaze, Crooklets and &#x27;middle&#x27; beach, are all within the town;
* Widemouth Bay is a few miles south of the town and offers a long, wide sandy beach;
* Sandymouth Beach is owned by the National Trust, and has spectacular cliffs and rock formations with shingle below the cliffs and a large expanse of sand at low tide. There are also a number of other coves and beaches to be found and explored in the local area.

===Bude Harbour and Canal===
In the 18th century there was a small unprotected tidal harbour at Bude. The Bude Canal Company built a canal and improved the harbour. Around twenty small boats use the tidal moorings of the original harbour during the summer months. Most are sport fishermen, but there is also some small-scale, semi-commercial, fishing for crab and lobster.

There is a wharf on the Bude Canal about half a mile from the sea lock that links the canal to the tidal haven. This can be opened only at or near high tide, and then only when sea conditions allow. North Cornwall District Council administered the canal, harbour and lock gates until its abolition in March 2009. These gates were renewed after the originals were damaged in a storm in 2008. They are the only manually operated sea lock gates in England. The pier head by the locks is a Grade II listed structure.

The canal is one of the few of note in south-west England. Its original purpose was to take small tub boats of mineral-rich sand from the beaches at Bude and carry them inland for agricultural use on fields. A series of inclined planes carried the boats over 400 vertical feet (120 m) to Red Post, where the canal branched south along the upper Tamar Valley towards Launceston east to Holsworthy and north to the Tamar Lakes, that fed the canal. The enterprise was always in financial difficulty, but it carried considerable volumes of sand and also coal from south Wales. The arrival of the railway at Holsworthy and the production of cheap manufactured fertiliser undermined the canal&#x27;s commercial purpose, and it was closed down and sold to the district municipal water company. However the wharf area and harbour enjoyed longer success, and coastal sailing ships carried grain across to Wales and coal back to Cornwall.

===Notable buildings===
Notable buildings include the parish church of St Michael and All Angels, built in 1835 and enlarged in 1876 (the architect was George Wightwick), Ebbingford Manor, and the town&#x27;s oldest house, Quay Cottage in the centre of town. Bude Castle was built about 1830 on sand on a concrete raft for Victorian inventor Sir Goldsworthy Gurney and is now a heritage centre. Gurney also invented the Bude Light.

At the northernmost point of Efford Down Farm, overlooking Summerleaze Beach and the breakwater, a former coastguard lookout stands. Known as Compass Point and built by the Acland family in 1840 of local sandstone, it is based on the Temple of Winds in Athens. It was moved to its current position in 1880 and again in 2023 to protect it from collapse due to cliff erosion. It is so called as it has points of the compass carved in each of its octagonal sides.

In 1953, Bude became home to the first Surf Life Saving Club, in the UK, while the popular lido Bude Sea Pool opened in 1930. This was previously administered by Cornwall Council but lost public funding in 2010/11. The Friends of Bude Sea Pool was created in 2011 to secure its future.

In September 2018, the &quot;Bude Tunnel&quot;, a 70-metre (80 yard) Perspex walkway at the Bude Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket site was mentioned in the national press after becoming the town&#x27;s top-rated attraction on TripAdvisor. Reviews facetiously compared the tunnel to the Taj Mahal, Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Great Sphinx of Giza. The popularity caused TripAdvisor to temporarily suspend all reviews for the Bude Tunnel, citing a number of reviews that &quot;do not describe a first-hand experience&quot;. The tunnel continued to be the top attraction for at least four months after the suspension. In December of that year, the tunnel was covered in Christmas lights. Reviews of the tunnel were reinstated by the website in October 2023, causing another influx of positive reviews.

In 2021, Bude hosted the Gorsedh Kernow (a festival of Cornish culture and bardic ceremony) as it did in 1961, 1975, and 1993. The festival was scheduled to take place in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Media ==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Caradon Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cornwall on 95.2 FM, Heart West on 105.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio on 102.2 FM and Piran Radio, a community based radio station which broadcasts online.

Bude developed its own newspaper in 1924, The Bude and Stratton Post.

Progressive rock band King Crimson wrote a song dedicated to the town and included it as the first track on their EP Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With.

==Railway==
From 1879 Bude&#x27;s nearest railway station was at Holsworthy, ten miles away. The railway came to Bude itself in 1898. The line was built by the London &amp; South Western Railway, but was incorporated into the Southern Railway in 1923 and British Railways in 1948.

Bude railway station was served by the &quot;Atlantic Coast Express&quot;, providing a direct service to/from London Waterloo, until it was discontinued in 1964. Bude station and the entire Bude branch line closed on 1 October 1966 as part of the Beeching cuts.

Bude and neighbouring Stratton are more distant from the rail network than any other towns in England. Okehampton (29 miles), Barnstaple (35 miles north east), Bodmin Parkway (32 miles south) and Gunnislake (32 miles sse) are the nearest National Rail stations with regular services.

==Industry==

Tourism is the main industry in the Bude area whilst some fishing is carried on. In the past, the staple trade was the export of sand, which, being highly charged with calcium carbonate, was much used as fertiliser. There are also golf links in the town.

The Bude area is also a telecommunications hub, with major subsea cables landing at nearby Widemouth Bay. The eavesdropping facility known as GCHQ Bude is just north of the town in Morwenstow. It is the largest employer in the area, with over 250 civil servants and contractors employed there.

==Local government==
Bude is in the North Cornwall parliamentary constituency which is represented by Ben Maguire MP. It developed from the much older market town of Stratton, inland to the east. Since Cornwall became a unitary authority in 2009 there has been a two-tier structure of local government: Cornwall Council (administers, for example, schools and highways, housing, social services, canal and harbour, refuse and recycling collection, street cleanliness; the town is represented by the Bude division) and Bude-Stratton Town Council (local children&#x27;s playground, Bude &quot;castle&quot;). There was some local argument when the town council adopted the name Bude-Stratton, as it was previously Stratton-Bude. Bude&#x27;s population in 1901 was 2308; by 2001 it had risen to 4674.

==Sport==
The town is home to a number of sports teams including Bude RFC – the town&#x27;s rugby club, and Bude Town – the local football club. Bude is the host town of the North Cornwall Cup, a large youth football event held every August. Bude &amp; North Cornwall Golf Club is ideally situated within the town centre. Bude is also home to the Bude Cricket Club.

===Cornish wrestling===
There have been Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, in Bude for at least a couple of centuries. Venues for tournaments included: the Castle grounds, Broadclose Hill and the Football ground.

<doc id="308096" wikidata="Q1892416" url="?curid=308096" title="Marazion">
<text>Marazion (; ) is a civil parish and town, on the shore of Mount&#x27;s Bay in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is east of Penzance and the tidal island of St Michael&#x27;s Mount is half-a-mile offshore. At low water a causeway links it to the town and at high water passenger boats carry visitors between Marazion and St Michael&#x27;s Mount.
Marazion is a tourist resort with an active community of artists who produce and sell paintings and pottery in the town&#x27;s art galleries.

Marazion lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. On the western side of the town is Marazion Marsh, a RSPB reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

==History of Marazion==
Remains of an ancient bronze furnace, discovered near the town, tend to prove that tin smelting was practised here at an early period. Marazion was not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1088. Its only charter was granted by Queen Elizabeth I.

===Medieval history===
The charter attributed to Robert, Count of Mortain granted lands and liberties to St Michael&#x27;s Mount opposite Marazion and included a market on Thursdays. This appears to have been held from the first on the mainland. From it is probably derived the &quot;Marghasbighan&quot; (&quot;Parvum Forum&quot;, lit. &quot;small marketplace&quot;) of the earlier and the &quot;Marghasyewe&quot; (Cornish: &quot;Thursday Market&quot;) or &quot;Marketjew&quot; (Forum Jovis) of the later charters. It may be added that a Jewish origin has been erroneously ascribed to the place from the name Marketjew.

It is certain that Richard, Earl of Cornwall provided that the three fairs, on the two feasts of St Michael and at Mid-Lent, and the three markets which had hitherto been held by the priors of St Michael&#x27;s Mount on land not their own at Marghasbighan, should in future be held on their own land at Marchadyou. He transferred in fact the fairs and markets from the demesne lands of the Bloyous in Marazion to those of the prior. Its earliest known charter was granted in 1257.

To remedy the loss incurred by this measure Ralph Bloyou in 1331 procured for himself and his heirs a market on Mondays and a fair on the vigil, feast, and morrow of St Andrew at Marghasyon. In Leland&#x27;s time the market was held at Marhasdeythyow (Forum Jovis), and both Norden (1582) and Carew (1602) tell us that Marcajewe signifies the Thursday&#x27;s market, which, whether etymologically sound or not, shows that the prior&#x27;s market had prevailed over its rival. In 1595, Queen Elizabeth granted to Marazion a charter of incorporation. This ratified the grant of St Andrew&#x27;s fair, provided for another on the Feast of St Barnabas and established a market on Saturdays.

The corporation was to consist of a mayor, eight aldermen and twelve capital burgesses. This corporation continued to administer the affairs of the borough until it was dissolved under the Municipal Corporations Act 1883. The chairman of the commissioners retains possession of the regalia. Of the fairs, only the Michaelmas fair has survived and all the markets have gone. The seal of the borough of Marazion was &quot;On a shield the arms three castles triple turreted&quot;, with the legend &quot;Semper Eadem&quot;.

It is stated that Marazion formerly had the right of returning two members to parliament. Dr Borlase gives the name of two, who in 1658, were re-elected: Richard Mlyll, Esq and Thomas Westlake, Esq; but the inhabitants petitioned against them taking their seats because they were unable to pay expenses for their attendance.

===Modern history===
Under the Commonwealth an attempt was made to secure or recover the right, and two members are said to have been returned, but they were not allowed to take their seats. Marazion was once a flourishing town, owing its prosperity to the throng of pilgrims who came to visit St Michael&#x27;s Mount (this ceased at the time of the Reformation). During the first half of the 16th century it was twice plundered; first by the French, and later by Cornish rebels. The rise and progress of the neighbouring borough of Penzance in the 17th century marginalised Marazion.

Penwith is believed to be the last part of Cornwall to speak Cornish as a community language. Dolly Pentreath, the last recorded speaker came from Paul in Penwith. A year following the death of Dolly Pentreath, Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.

The graveyard of Gulval church is the burial place of local pirate and smuggler John &#x27;Eyebrows&#x27; Thomas of Marazion.

The West Cornwall Railway opened Marazion railway station on 11 March 1852 and its goods yard handled a large volume of perishable traffic – fish, fruit, and vegetables – from the surrounding farms and harbours. Marazion station closed to passenger traffic in October 1964 and to freight in December 1965. For many years the site of the closed station was home to Pullman railway carriages which were used as camping coaches. The site, though not conveniently located, is on Cornwall&#x27;s still-operating passenger main-line, so there are aspirations to re-open it.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution opened a &#x27;Marazion Lifeboat Station&#x27; in 1990, although the inshore lifeboat was actually kept in a shed on the quayside on St Michael&#x27;s Mount. The station was closed on 31 October 2001 as it was proving difficult to find enough volunteer crew members. The boat was transferred to the neighbouring Penlee Lifeboat Station at Newlyn on the other side of Mounts Bay where there is a larger population to draw the crews from.

At the end of the Second World War a number of naval vessels, the most famous of which was the battleship were broken up on the beaches at Marazion. HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; was beached and broken up in 1947.

In 2021, the town received a brief spike in publicity after submitting itself for consideration for city status as part of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s jubilee celebrations. The bid was considered by most to be hopeless, however if granted, Marazion would have been the smallest city in the UK, taking the title from St Davids in Wales.

==Local government==
The A394 road between Marazion, Helston and Penryn was once run by Helston Turnpike Roads Trust, which charged tolls for using the road. On 1 November 1880 the Trust put up for auction the toll houses at Marazion and Wendron as well as ″materials″ such as granite posts, chains, gates, etc. The charging of tolls ended on 7 November 1880 and the road came under the management of the County (note:Cornwall County Council was not formed until 1889).

From 1894 to 1974, Marazion was part of West Penwith Rural District and in a reorganisation of local government in 1974 became part of Penwith District Council. Following the 1974 reorganisation Marazion parish regained its town status and right to elect a Mayor from the Marazion Town Council. As an historical oddity the civic regalia of the Mayor is still held by the Marazion Town Trust: for a Mayoral election in Marazion it is still a requirement for the Mayor-Elect to be appointed the Chairman of the Trust before the actual appointment can take place (this is reflected in the process of the Mayor choosing ceremony where two nominations take place for two separate offices). Cornwall Council is now the principal local authority in the area (since April 2009). The coat of arms of the town of Marazion appears on the seal as three castles triple turreted and the motto is &quot;Semper eadem&quot; (Always the same). Marazion made an outsider bid for city status in 2021.

The population in 2011 was 1,440 and the electoral ward population which includes surrounding villages was 4,625 

==Architecture==

The lack of notable or historic buildings led Nikolaus Pevsner to omit the town entirely from the first edition of his &quot;Buildings of England&quot; account of Cornwall. In the second edition Marazion is described as &quot;attractive as a whole&quot; and he says of the area near the ferry port: the &quot;cobbled pavements and old houses .. give a look of Lyme Regis to the old centre of the town&quot;. Nevertheless, several notable architectural buildings lie in the eastern part of Marazion including Chymorvah House and the Mount Haven Hotel next to it, once one of the most haunted hotels in Cornwall, with views of the mount from its terrace. Also of note are Marazion Town Hall and the Marazion War Memorial.

The Old Manor House on Fore Street is a Grade II listed building. The Listing states that it was built circa 1775 for William Cornish a former mayor; extensions were added in the mid 19th century at the rear and the east side of the building. During an unstated number of years in the 1800s, this was the home of noted architect James Piers St Aubyn. It was more recently owned by the fashion designer, Jeff Banks. The property was listed for sale in 2019. The listing report stated that the house included &quot;original slate floors, open fireplaces, sash windows, exposed beams, intricate cornices and wood panelling&quot; and featured views of St Michael&#x27;s Mount.

Pevsner mentions one grand Georgian house at the west end of the town. This is known as the Rookery or Manor Office and was built from 1775 onwards for Marazion merchant John Blewett, but incomplete when he died in 1777. It is also a Grade II listed building.

===Churches===
The original parish church is at St Hilary. In Marazion there was a chapel of ease dedicated to St Hermes (recorded in 1308): by 1735 it had become ruinous and was rebuilt. In 1861 a new church (dedicated to All Saints) was built on the same site which became a parish church in 1893. The architect was J. P. St Aubyn. The Ebenezer (Free Methodist Church) chapel at the west end of the town is a classical revival building of 1862 with galleries, Grade II listed and now turned into private dwellings. The Grade II listed Wesleyan Methodist Church on Fore Street was built 1893-1895 and replaced the earlier (1811) Wesleyan chapel across the road, which was sold following storm damage and demolished to make way for private dwellings. The Friends Meeting House on Beacon Road dates from c.1688 (with limited remodelling 1742 and circa 1880) and is a classic simple Quaker meeting house still in use today.

==Sport==

Marazion Blues are an association football team, founded in 1906, and disbanded in 2017 because of a lack of players. They were members of the Cornwall Combination League from 1961 to 2004, twice champions in 1978 and 1980 and cup winners in 1972 and 1979. The Blues restarted in July 2018 and will play in the Trelawny League.

<doc id="308097" wikidata="Q893466" url="?curid=308097" title="Song cycle">
<text>A song cycle () is a group, or cycle, of individually complete songs designed to be performed in sequence, as a unit.

The songs are either for solo voice or an ensemble, or rarely a combination of solo songs mingled with choral pieces. The number of songs in a song cycle may be as brief as two songs or as long as 30 or more songs. The term &quot;song cycle&quot; did not enter lexicography until 1865, in Arrey von Dommer&#x27;s edition of &quot;Koch’s Musikalisches Lexikon&quot;, but works definable in retrospect as song cycles existed long before then. One of the earliest examples may be the set of seven Cantigas de amigo by the 13th-century Galician jongleur Martin Codax. Jeffrey Mark identified the group of dialect songs &#x27;Hodge und Malkyn&#x27; from Thomas Ravenscroft&#x27;s &quot;The Briefe Discourse&quot; (1614) as the first of a number of early 17th-century examples in England.

A song cycle is similar to a song collection, and the two can be difficult to distinguish. Some type of coherence, however, is regarded as a necessary attribute of song cycles. It may derive from the text (a single poet; a story line; a central theme or topic such as love or nature; a unifying mood; poetic form or genre, as in a sonnet or ballad cycle) or from musical procedures (tonal schemes; recurring motifs, passages or entire songs; formal structures). These unifying features may appear singly or in combination. Because of these many variations, the song cycle &quot;resists definition&quot;. The nature and quality of the coherence within a song cycle must therefore be examined &quot;in individual cases&quot;.

==Song cycles in German Lieder==
Although most European countries began developing the art song genre by the beginning of the 19th century, the rise of Lieder in &quot;Austria and Germany have outweighed all others in terms of influence.&quot; German-language song composition at the end of 18th century shifted from accessible, Strophic form, more traditional folk songs to 19th century settings of more sophisticated poetry for a more educated middle class, &quot;who were gradually supplanting the aristocracy as the main patrons of the arts&quot;. Since these songs were relatively small-scale works, like the lyric poetry used for their musical settings, they were often published in collections, and consequently borrowed various poetic terms to mark their groupings: &quot;Reihe&quot; (series), &quot;Kranz&quot; (ring), &quot;Zyklus&quot; (cycle) or &quot;Kreis&quot; (circle). In the first few decades of the 1800s, the collections of poetry and the subsequent song settings took on more underlying coherence and dramatic plot, giving rise to the song cycle. This coherence allowed the song genre to be elevated to a &quot;higher form&quot;, serious enough to be compared with symphonies and cycles of lyric piano pieces.

Two of the earliest examples of the German song cycle were composed in 1816: Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;An die ferne Geliebte&quot; (Op. 98), and &quot;Die Temperamente beim Verluste der Geliebten&quot; (J. 200-3, \Op. 46) by Carl Maria von Weber.

The genre was firmly established by the cycles of Schubert; his &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; (1823) and &quot;Winterreise&quot; (1827), settings of poems by Wilhelm Müller, are among his most greatly admired works. Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Schwanengesang&quot; (1828), though collected posthumously, is also frequently performed as a cycle.

Schumann&#x27;s great cycles were all composed in 1840. They comprise &quot;Dichterliebe&quot;, &quot;Frauenliebe und -leben&quot;, two collections entitled &quot;Liederkreis&quot; (Opp. 24 &amp; 39 on texts by Heinrich Heine and Eichendorf respectively)—a German word meaning a song cycle—and the &quot;Kerner Lieder&quot; (Op. 35), a &quot;Liederreihe&quot; (literally &quot;song row&quot;) on poems by Justinus Kerner. Brahms composed settings (Op. 33) of verses from Ludwig Tieck&#x27;s novel &quot;Magelone&quot;, and modern performances usually include some sort of connecting narration. He also wrote &quot;Vier ernste Gesänge&quot; (&quot;Four Serious Songs&quot;), Op. 121 (1896). Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot;, &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot;, and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; expand the accompaniment from piano to orchestra.

Wolf made the composition of song collections by a single poet something of a specialty, although only the shorter &quot;Italian Songbook&quot; and &quot;Spanish Songbook&quot; are performed at a single sitting, and Eisler&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Liederbuch&quot; also falls into the category of anthology.

&quot;Das Buch der hängenden Gärten&quot; by Schoenberg and Krenek&#x27;s &quot;Reisebuch aus den österreichischen Alpen&quot; are important 20th-century examples. Wilhelm Killmayer composed several song cycles, on lyrics by Sappho, French Renaissance poets, German Romantic poets, and contemporary poets. The tradition was carried on by Wolfgang Rihm, with cycles such as &quot;Reminiszenz&quot; (2017). Graham Waterhouse composed song cycles including &quot;Sechs späteste Lieder&quot; after Hölderlin&#x27;s late poems in 2003.

==Song cycles in France==
The six songs of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les nuits d&#x27;été&quot; (1841), first published with piano accompaniment but later orchestrated, is a notable early example of the French song cycle. French cycles reached a pinnacle in Fauré&#x27;s &quot;La bonne chanson&quot; (Verlaine) of the early 1890s, &quot;La chanson d&#x27;Ève&quot;, premiered complete in 1910, and &quot;L&#x27;horizon chimérique&quot; (1921). Chabrier&#x27;s four &#x27;Barnyard songs&#x27; (1889) &quot;introduced a new note into contemporary French music&quot; and prefigured Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Histoires naturelles&quot;. Poulenc produced a long line of song cycles, from &quot;Le Bestiaire&quot; (1919), the &quot;Poèmes de Ronsard&quot; of 1925, &quot;Chansons Gaillardes&quot; (anonymous 17th-century texts) of the following year, &quot;Quatre poèmes de Guillaume Apollinaire&quot; (1931), &quot;Tel jour telle nuit&quot; (poems by Paul Éluard), 1937, &quot;Banalités&quot; (poems by Apollinaire, 1940), to his last, &quot;La Courte Paille&quot; (1960) - seven songs in eight minutes.
&quot;Poèmes pour Mi&quot;, &quot;Chants de Terre et de Ciel&quot; and &quot;Harawi&quot; by Messiaen, &quot;Paroles tissées&quot; and &quot;Chantefleurs et Chantefables&quot; by Lutosławski (only an honorary Frenchman) as well as &quot;Correspondances&quot; and &quot;Le temps l&#x27;horloge&quot; by Dutilleux continued the French cycle tradition in the later 20th century.

==English, Scottish, and American song cycles==
Perhaps the first English song cycle was Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens&quot; (1871), to a text of eleven poems by Tennyson. In the early 20th century, Vaughan Williams composed his famous song cycle, the &quot;Songs of Travel&quot;. Other song cycles by Vaughan Williams are &quot;The House of Life&quot; on sonnets by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and &quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; on poems from A. E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, the latter originally for voice with piano and string quartet but later orchestrated. The composer and renowned Lieder accompanist Benjamin Britten also wrote song cycles, including &quot;The Holy Sonnets of John Donne&quot;, &quot;Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo&quot;, &quot;Sechs Hölderlin-Fragmente&quot;, and &quot;Winter Words&quot;, all with piano accompaniment, and the orchestral &quot;Les Illuminations&quot;, &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot;, and &quot;Nocturne&quot;.

&quot;Raising Sparks&quot; (1977) by the Scottish composer James MacMillan (1997) is a more recent example. 
Trevor Hold wrote numerous song cycles, including many setting his own words, such as &quot;The Image Stays&quot; (1979), &quot;River Songs&quot; (1982) and &quot;Book of Beasts&quot; (1984). 
The English composer Robin Holloway&#x27;s many song cycles include &quot;From High Windows&quot; (Philip Larkin) (1977), &quot;Wherever We May Be&quot; (Robert Graves) (1980) and &quot;Retreats and Advances&quot; (A.S.J. Tessimond) (2016). His pupil Peter Seabourne&#x27;s five song cycles include &quot;Sonnets to Orpheus&quot; (2016) setting eleven poems of Rainer Maria Rilke. Stephen Hough has written three cycles: &quot;Herbstlieder&quot; (Rilke) (2007), &quot;Dappled Things&quot; (Wilde and Hopkins) (2013), and &quot;Other Love Songs&quot; (2010) for four singers and piano duet. Graham Waterhouse composed several song cycles, based on texts by Shakespeare, James Joyce, and Irish female writers, among others.

American examples include Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Hermit Songs&quot; (1953), &quot;Mélodies Passagères&quot;, and &quot;Despite and Still&quot;, and by Leonard Bernstein, &quot;Hammarskjöld Portrait&quot; (1974), &quot;Les Olympiques&quot; (1976), &quot;Tribute to a Hero&quot; (1981), &quot;Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens&quot; (1989), &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot; (1985), and &quot;A Year of Birds&quot; (1995) by Malcolm Williamson, Maury Yeston&#x27;s &quot;December Songs&quot; (1991), commissioned by Carnegie Hall for its centennial year celebration, &quot;Honey and Rue&quot; by André Previn (composed for the American soprano Kathleen Battle). David Conte&#x27;s &quot;American Death Ballads&quot; (2015). Alex Weiser&#x27;s song cycle in Yiddish and English, &quot;and all the days were purple&quot; (2019), was a 2020 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

==Song cycles in other countries==
Mussorgsky wrote &quot;Sunless&quot; (1874), &quot;The Nursery&quot; (1868–72) and &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot; (1875–77), and Shostakovich wrote cycles on English and Yiddish poets, as well as Michelangelo and Alexander Pushkin.

In 2020, Rodrigo Ruiz became the first Mexican composer known to have written a song cycle. Ruiz&#x27;s &quot;Venus &amp; Adonis&quot; sets Shakespeare&#x27;s eponymous narrative poem in what became the first song cycle to ever be written entirely to Shakespearean texts.

The orchestral song cycle &quot;Sing, Poetry&quot; on the 2011 album &quot;Troika&quot; consists of settings of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s Russian and English-language poetry by three Russian and three American composers.

Cycles in other languages have been written by Granados, Mohammed Fairouz, Cristiano Melli, Falla, Juan María Solare, Grieg, Lorenzo Ferrero, Dvořák, Janáček, Bartók, Kodály, Sibelius, Rautavaara, Peter Schat, Mompou, Montsalvatge, and A. Saygun etc.

==Popular music==

Song cycles written by popular musicians (also called rock operas) are a short series of songs that tell a story or focus on a particular theme. Some musicians also blend tracks together, so that the start of the next song continues from the preceding one. Modern examples of this can be found in James Pankow&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot; (for Chicago on their self-titled second album) Pink Floyd&#x27;s rock opera &quot;The Wall&quot;, Dream Theater&#x27;s progressive metal albums &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; and &quot;The Astonishing&quot;, as well as Marvin Gaye&#x27;s classic soul album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;.

The R&amp;B singer Raphael Saadiq&#x27;s 2019 album, &quot;Jimmy Lee&quot;, is composed as a song cycle with personal narratives thematizing issues affecting African Americans, including addiction, stress, domestic conflict, AIDS, perpetual financial hardship, and mass incarceration.

==Musical theater==

One of the earliest song cycle musical theater works was created in 1991. This was &quot;December Songs&quot; (1991), created by Maury Yeston, and commissioned by Carnegie Hall for its Centennial celebration in 1991. It has been translated, performed and recorded in French, German. and Polish. Other examples include &quot;Ghost Quartet&quot; by Dave Malloy (2014), &quot;Songs for a New World&quot; by Jason Robert Brown (1995), William Finn&#x27;s &quot;Elegies&quot; (2003), Bill Russell&#x27;s &quot;Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens&quot; (1989), and &quot;Myths and Hymns&quot; by Adam Guettel (1998).

<text>Pipex ( ) was the United Kingdom&#x27;s first commercial Internet service provider (ISP). It was formed in 1990 and helped to develop the ISP market in the UK. In 1992 it began operating a 64k transatlantic leased line and built a connection to the UK government&#x27;s JANET network. One of its first customers was Demon Internet which popularised dial up modem based internet access in the UK. It was also one of the key players in the development of the London Internet Exchange through a meeting with BT in 1994.

The company went through a number of mergers and acquisitions and by 2007 had dropped to be the sixth largest ISP in the UK. The Pipex name was used by a number of companies within the group, which were gradually renamed following the sale of its home broadband business to Tiscali UK in 2007. In 2009, the former Pipex Wireless business, rebranded as Freedom4, bought the former Pipex Business, known as Vialtus. Freedom4 also purchased Daisy Group through a reverse takeover, and the three companies were brought together as Daisy.

==History==
===Formation===
The company was formed as the first commercial ISP in the UK by Unipalm in 1990 as &quot;The Public I.P. Exchange Ltd&quot; (PIPEX), founded by Peter Dawe. In mid 1992, it began operating a 64k transatlantic leased line to UUNET and another to JANET. One of its first customers was Demon Internet, shortly followed by the BBC.

In November 1994, Keith Mitchell, then chief technical officer of PIPEX, initiated a meeting with BT to discuss the creation of a London-based Internet exchange. Pipex donated a Cisco Catalyst 1200 Network switch which formed the basis of the London Internet Exchange (LINX).
Unipalm Pipex was sold to UUNet in November 1995 for £150 million and became UUNet/Pipex.

The brand became known as &quot;Worldcom Pipex&quot;, after UUnet merged with MFS, which is later acquired by WorldCom before merging with MCI to form MCI WorldCom, later renaming back to MCI which was then taken over by Verizon Communications. Pipex retained contracts with Verizon with regards to the network structure. David Rickards and family acquired the PIPEX brand for an undisclosed sum and the new company PIPEX Internet Ltd was born.

In January 2002 saw the first push to provide digital subscriber line (DSL) lines instead of traditional modems and Pipex invested £2 million to get 40,000 DSL users online.

===Reorganisation===
In October 2003 Pipex was acquired by GX Networks plc, which retained the Pipex name by renaming itself Pipex Communications plc. In September 2006, Pipex purchased Toucan from IDT Telecom for £24 million, and Cable &amp; Wireless&#x27; Bulldog Broadband for £12 million.

Pipex sold its home broadband business and the rights to use the Pipex name to Tiscali UK in July 2007 for £210 million. As a consequence, Pipex Wireless was renamed Freedom4 in October 2007, followed by Pipex Business in February 2008 which was renamed Vialtus. Pipex Communications reverted to the GX Networks name in March 2008.

Freedom4 agreed to purchase Vialtus and Daisy Group in July 2009, performing a reverse takeover of Daisy. The former Pipex residential business, as part of Tiscali, was integrated into TalkTalk when Tiscali UK was itself acquired by TalkTalk&#x27;s parent The Carphone Warehouse in 2009.

<text>The MBT-70 (German: or ) was an American–West German joint project to develop a new main battle tank during the 1960s.

The MBT-70 was developed by the United States and West Germany in the context of the Cold War, intended to counter the new generation of tanks developed by the Soviet Union for the Warsaw Pact. The new tank was to be equipped with a number of advanced features such as newly developed &quot;kneeling&quot; hydropneumatic suspension and housing the entire crew in the large turret, and was armed with a 152mm XM150 gun/launcher, which could use both conventional ammunition and the MGM-51 Shillelagh missile for long range combat.

The program faced significant challenges from the start, including poor communication and coordination between the American and West German teams working on the project. The U.S. Army and the German Bundeswehr had different requirements which were not aligned and were not resolved before the project was too far advanced to be changed.

By the late 1960s, the development of the MBT-70 was well over budget, leading West Germany to withdraw from the project in 1969. The United States continued development of the MBT-70 (spun off as the XM803) until 1971 when the program was finally cancelled, with funds and technology from the MBT-70 project redirected to the development of the M1 Abrams. West Germany independently developed the Leopard 2 as its new main battle tank.

==History==

=== Background ===

The joint German–US main battle tank program was the brainchild of US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. After serving in the US Army Air Forces during World War II, McNamara became a &quot;Whiz Kid&quot; at Ford Motor Company, where he later rose to become president. McNamara&#x27;s interest in German engineering had been shown during his tenure as head of Ford. He had shepherded development of the abortive Ford Cardinal – a cancelled project involving the redevelopment for US and other international markets of a compact family car designed by engineers in both the US and Germany. This, it was hoped, would result in a new, competitive product for international markets, with reduced development costs.

As Defense Secretary, McNamara began to apply his methods of industrial management to military production. At the time, NATO member states fielded many different weapons systems and these generally lacked common ammunition, fuel and parts; few weapons were developed jointly, including tanks. While West Germany used American M48 Pattons, it had historically excelled in engineering armored fighting vehicles and was known to be proceeding with plans to design, develop and build its own tanks. McNamara regarded Germany as an increasingly important member of NATO and believed that joint development would yield superior weapons that could also be used by other NATO members, as well as allies outside NATO.

In 1961, McNamara approached German Minister of Defence Franz Josef Strauss about beginning a collaborative main battle tank program. Strauss wrote off McNamara&#x27;s idea and suggested that the U.S. should buy the Leopard 1. Germany, which was readying production of its indigenous Leopard 1 tank, had little interest in starting another main battle tank project. Strauss did however agree to a common component program. McNamara continued to press for Germany&#x27;s cooperation in a common tank program, succeeding the next year in brokering a tentative agreement with the Germans.

The US Armor Branch had long been pressing the Pentagon to fast-track new main battle tank designs. Consequently, McNamara&#x27;s seven-year timeline to production was opposed by senior armor officers, who believed an all-new MBT was more urgently needed. Others questioned McNamara&#x27;s high regard for German engineering, arguing that Germany&#x27;s collective abilities in tank design and engineering had dwindled and not kept pace with innovations since the end of World War II. Within US armored circles, it was believed that there would be a net technology transfer towards Germany and there was a common belief that the UK would make a better partner. However, McNamara&#x27;s choice of Germany was also due to the country&#x27;s excellent economic position, following its successful post-war rebuilding: the so-called &quot;economic miracle&quot;. Hence Germany was better positioned to financially commit to a project of this scale.

In order to develop a tank that would meet the requirements of both armies, in August 1963, Germany and the United States signed a memorandum of understanding that specified certain desired characteristics and organized a Joint Engineering Agency and a Joint Design Team with equal representation from both countries. Despite these measures, conflicts between the differing engineering practices of each country would plague the MBT-70 project throughout its development.

=== Development of the MBT-70 ===
In 1963, General Welborn G. Dolvin, a former tank commander, was chosen to lead the US team as project manager. Three contractors—Chrysler Defense, General Motors and a joint venture of Ford and FMC—entered contention to become the contractor on the American side. Dolvin chose GM, anticipating the company would bring more fresh ideas to the table than longtime incumbent tank producer Chrysler. For the Germans, the German Development Corporation was formed as a joint venture of several German firms.

For the first phase of development, GM engineers would work alongside German engineers in Augsburg. For this part, Americans would manage Germans. For the second phase, the arrangement would be reversed: Germans would take over management at GM&#x27;s factories in Detroit.

There were disputes over almost every part of the design: the gun, the engine, and the use of both metric and SAE units in the separately manufactured components of the tank. This last dispute was, by far, the most contentious. The disagreement rose to McNamara and German Defense Minister Kai-Uwe von Hassel, who were also unable to settle on a common measurement system. An agreement was made for both sides to use their own preferred measurements on parts they designed. The Americans conceded that metric be used on all fastening points. This was settled by an agreement to use a common metric standard in all interface connections. The resulting complexity contributed to delays in the development schedule, and an inflated project budget. Another national difference was different methods of projection. In production, confusion over which projection method was being used could result in fabrication errors such as holes placed in the wrong side.

The Americans were taken aback by the German&#x27;s approach to intellectual property. The German firms jealously guarded their trade secrets from the Americans and pushed aggressively for the use of their products in the final product. This cultural confusion stemmed from differences in the procurement system of both countries. In the US, the Pentagon footed the expenses for most research and development. In return, the government kept complete ownership of the product of the research. German firms conducted research and development under government contracts like in the US, but retained all the rights to their design. There was thus a great incentive for German firms to solicit orders for their designs.

Dolvin stepped down in October 1966 to assume command of an armored division. The program was considered to be at least moderately successful when Major General Edwin H. Burba took over the project.

Nevertheless, many problems with the tank&#x27;s political future arose in the US. When a design was finalized in 1965, US program costs were estimated at $138 million. With a production decision looming in 1968, this rose to $303 million. The following year critics came up with a different estimate of more than half a billion by accounting for other additional costs.

Programmatic complexity and growing costs contributed to Germany&#x27;s disillusionment with the joint project. Germany was concerned about the design differences that were emerging between the two teams. Germany regarded the unconventional American engine as unproven and believed the American gun/launcher as a design that would add costs and complexity to the design while offering only marginal gains in accuracy at ranges beyond 2000 meters (while being worse at ordinary ranges). The use of non-metric fasteners, insisted upon by the Americans, was also believed by Germany to have been an unnecessary compromise. In 1965, Germany reduced its financial commitment to the program, claiming it was unable to pay for its half of the expenses. By 1969, Germany had reduced its involvement with the project, which was becoming a political embarrassment within the Bundeswehr. Germany reduced its Detroit office presence to a mere skeleton crew. Germany sought to reduce the size of its KPz-70 purchase, originally 500 tanks, if not cancel it altogether.

Many Americans both inside and outside the project, including General Creighton Abrams, hoped for an amicable end to German involvement in the program. Burba was succeeded by Brigadier General Bernard R. Luczak in mid-1968. Luczak agreed that the German partnership was not working out. Luczak found support from Deputy Secretary David Packard, who brokered an agreement to end the tank partnership in January 1970.

===Concurrent developments===
By 1965 the German Leopard 1 and the US M60 were the newest main battle tanks in their respective country&#x27;s service. They were armed with the M68 105 mm rifled gun (developed from the British 105mm L7) and designed to counter Soviet T-54/55 tanks, which they successfully did, according to Israeli combat experience. But it became very clear that due to the same experience the next generation of Soviet tanks would have increased firepower and protection, and both designs would be placed at a disadvantage by the new smoothbore gun in the T-62. An upgrade project for the Leopard was planned, but it appeared this model would not be enough of an advance to be worthwhile.

==Design==
Many features of the MBT-70 were ahead of their time. The vehicle used an advanced hydropneumatic suspension system that allowed for fast cross-country speeds even though it was to weigh . The suspension could be raised or lowered on command by the driver, down to put the bottom of the tank just over from the ground, or up to for cross-country running.

The MBT-70 was designed with a low silhouette, unlike the M60, one of the tallest tanks ever built. The MBT-70 ended up very low, just over from the floor to the turret-roof. This left no room in the hull for the driver, who had to be moved into the turret. He was located in a cupola which was geared to rotate so that he was always looking in the same direction even if the turret turned. He could also spin the cupola around, so the tank could be driven backwards at full speed.

The US version was to mount the newly developed Continental AVCR air-cooled V-12 diesel of . German versions originally used a similar Daimler-Benz model, but later moved to an MTU design of . The MTU unit could be easily swapped out of the tank, along with the drive train, in 15 minutes. Both versions could reach on their engines, compared to for the T-62.

===Armament===
The MBT-70&#x27;s main armament was a stabilized XM150 152 mm gun/launcher, a longer-barreled and improved variant of the XM-81 gun/launcher used in the light M551 Sheridan and the M60A2 &quot;Starship&quot;. This gun/launcher could fire conventional 152 mm rounds like High Explosive, anti-personnel, M409A1 High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) and the XM578E1 Armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, Beehive anti-personnel rounds, but also the MGM-51 Shillelagh missile, a 152 mm guided missile, which had a combat range of some .

In the 1960s the effective combat range of the 105 mm L7 tank gun was considered to be about . The XM578 APFSDS round was made of a newly developed tungsten alloy, which was 97.5 percent tungsten. This new alloy had a density of 18.5 g·cm³, which was a big improvement compared to the older tungsten-carbide APDS and APFSDS rounds. Another new feature of the ammunition was that the tank rounds were &quot;caseless&quot;; i.e., they had combustible cases.

The MBT-70 was equipped with a laser rangefinder and a 26-round auto-loader in the turret bustle. Although the auto-loader was supposed to be capable of loading both missiles and combustible-case tank rounds, the German Rheinmetal autoloader was prone to deforming the ammunition&#x27;s fragile combustible cases. The Americans substituted the German autoloader with a General Motors design, which increased the ammunition capacity to 48 rounds. Italy had also contributed to the XM-150 as the automatic loading system was built by OTO Melara (now Leonardo). The automatic loading system had a vertical rotating magazine equipped with 16 containers, for 5 types of ammunition, which allowed a firing speed of 12 rounds per minute. 

46 152 mm rounds could be carried on the models with Rheinmetal autoloaders. The MBT-70 with the GM autoloader could carry 48 rounds, and the XM803 could carry 50 rounds. The MBT-70 with the Rheinmetall loader carried 26 rounds in the autoloader. Twenty more rounds were carried in two compartments including eight rounds stowed on the rear hull bulkhead and twelve behind the driver&#x27;s capsule.

The Germans were planning to use the MBT-70 in combination with the &quot;Keiler&quot;, a tank equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm smoothbore gun. Therefore, a suggestion was made to base a version of the Keiler on the MBT-70 chassis; this version was nicknamed &quot;Eber&quot;, but only a wooden mock-up was made. According to the German plans, the MBT-70 would destroy enemies at long ranges, while the &quot;Keiler&quot; would have an effective combat range of up to .

The secondary armament of the MBT-70 consisted of a remote-controlled 20 mm Rh 202 autocannon (with storage for 750 or 660 rounds) for use against aircraft and light armored vehicles. The gun could be retracted into a container behind the driver&#x27;s rotating cupola for protection as well as to reduce overall height, and was operated remotely by the commander. Furthermore, a 7.62 mm was mounted co-axially alongside the main gun for close defense. The US prototypes were fitted with the M73 machine gun, while the German version utilized the MG 3 machine gun.

The ammunition load of the MBT-70 prototype seen in the &quot;Deutsches Panzermuseum&quot; consists of 42 tank rounds, 6 Shillelagh missiles, 660 20×139 mm cannon rounds and 2,700 7.62×51mm NATO machine gun rounds.

===Protection===
The frontal area of both the hull and turret was protected by spaced armor and provision was made for the installation of a polyethylene radiation shielding to achieve an attenuation ratio of 20:1 against neutron radiation.

The outer layer was made of High Performance Armour developed in the United States and incorporated in the mid-1960s in the design of the MBT-70. The High Performance Armour contained 9% of nickel and 4% of cobalt and was produced by vacuum arc remelting. It was heat treated to 500 BHN, like the other types of high hardness armor, but it was produced from the start in the form of plates 40 mm thick. The armor was well protected against gun fired HEAT munitions, but lacked protection against kinetic munitions. 

Two watertight armored transverse bulkheads separated the crew in the center from the multi-ply rubber fuel tank in the front compartment and the engine compartment in the rear.

To save weight, aluminum was used for the engine compartment floor and for access doors on the engine deck.
The MBT-70 was protected against electromagnetic pulses and nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as well.
The tank&#x27;s low silhouette, which could be lowered from to only , was also a large advantage. Compared to the M60 tank, the MBT-70 had a lower profile. With the hydropneumatic suspension lowered it was also smaller than the Leopard 1, which gave the MBT-70 a better hull down position.

The MBT-70 was equipped with eight XM176 smoke grenade dischargers, each discharger barrel contained two smoke grenades; one AN-M8 HC and one M34 WP. Actuated from the commander&#x27;s station, these launchers provided close-in protection and concealment for the vehicle. The KPz-70 was equipped with 16 in four rows of 4.

===Mobility===
;American variant
The American variant was powered by a Continental Motors AVCR-1100 diesel engine, . This was paired to a German Renk electro-hydraulic transmission. The top speed was and the range was . The top reverse speed was the same as its top forward speed.

In 1969, the American team decided to eventually replace the diesel engine with an Avco-Lycoming AGT-1500 gas turbine engine on the production model.

;West German variant
The Daimler-Benz/MTU MB 873 Ka-500 four-stroke diesel engine on the German variant was heavier and larger than the American Continental Motors engine. The choice of this engine required some changes to the chassis. The engine was paired with a Renk HSWL 354/2 hydraulically operated gearbox with four gears and two reverse. The top speed was and the range was .

==Testing==

A prototype series started in 1965, with two mild steel hull and six &quot;complete&quot; hulls of both the US and German versions, for a total of 14 hulls. The lower hull and drivetrain were tested in 1966, and full trials began in 1968.

The tank proved to have better mobility than the M60: it was considerably faster, both in all-out speed and, more importantly, with about three times the acceleration. All of this led to a reduction in the time the tank was exposed to fire, in testing it was 1/3 less likely to be seen while maneuvering than the M60, and it could run a obstacle course in 30% less time.

A year behind schedule, the U.S. and Germany debuted their MBT-70s publicly in October 1967. An American prototype was displayed outside the Association of the United States Army in Washington. The German demonstration in Augsburg ended prematurely: smoke poured out of the tank after the turret&#x27;s hydraulics malfunctioned. Observers were nonetheless impressed and German officials said the tank was on track to replace all M48 Pattons of the Bundeswehr by 1972.

===Problems===
An unanticipated problem was that the drivers complained of disorientation when the turret was rotated, contrary to the predictions of the designers who felt the location of the cupola near the center of rotation would eliminate this effect. The German 120mm gun proved excellent, although only firing APFSDS and HEAT, but the XM150 gun/launcher had serious problems. The similar but smaller XM81 gun/launcher mounted on the M551 Sheridan proved to be just as troublesome. There were also several problems with the ammunition. The caseless design made conventional tank rounds too vulnerable to water. Wet rounds expanded so they would not fit into the barrel anymore or left hard residues after being fired.

The auto-loader was capable of handling the Shillelagh missile without problems, but the combustible cases of the tank rounds could be deformed by it. As is often a problem with caseless ammunition, the ammunition also had a tendency to &quot;cook-off&quot;, or fire prematurely, due to heat build-up in the barrel from previously fired rounds. The attempted solution, to only carry a single round with the balance in missiles, also proved unacceptable. Deployment of the 20mm anti-aircraft cannon also proved difficult and the weapon itself was overcomplicated and nearly impossible to use effectively.

Another problem of the MBT-70 was the increasing weight. While at the beginning of the project, a weight of some was projected, it increased to during development, which forced the designers to redesign some elements, so that finally a weight of was reached, still higher than required. This meant that the MBT-70 would require its own armored recovery vehicles and bridge-launching systems. Germany became concerned with the excessive weight of the tank. One solution proposed removing radiation hardening from the turret, but this called into question the wisdom of the driver-in-turret configuration, which was intended to protect the crew in the event of a nuclear blast. 

Commentators on the MBT-70 typically assert that though it was innovative in many respects, the project was ruined by the use of too many untried and unproven technologies. Senator James W. Fulbright quipped that to drive an MBT-70, a master&#x27;s degree from a technical institute would be required.

==Cancellation==
By 1969 the MBT-70 cost five times what was projected, at $1 million a unit. Originally the planned costs of the MBT-70 project were as low as $80 million (or 292.8 million DM), but in 1969 the project had already cost $303 million (nearly 1.1 billion DM). West Germany&#x27;s part alone of this was about $130 million (475.8 million DM), which in itself was more than the original planned total costs of the project.

Frustrated with the lack of resolution to the tank&#x27;s technical problems and excessive weight, Germany announced in April 1969 that it would cut back on its purchase of the MBT-70 and begin development of a new tank.

A July 1969 House Armed Services subcommittee report on the troubled M551 Sheridan asked that funding for the MBT-70 be withheld pending a comprehensive review of the program. In August 1969, Senator Thomas Eagleton was granted a request that the Government Accounting Office undertake an audit of the program.

The GAO recommended the tank development program proceed on an austere basis. Acting on this recommendation, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard agreed to withhold $25 million earmarked for the production of six prototypes while the DoD completed a review of the project. Packard was ultimately persuaded by Army leaders that the American MBT-70 project was technically sound. The Army agreed that development would be better off without German cooperation. In January 1970, the Department of Defense ended its tank partnership with Germany and committed to forging ahead with its own design.

The U.S. spent $305.4 million on the MBT-70 and XM803 programs, while Germany spent $100 million.

Germany subsequently started the development of the &quot;Keiler&quot; tank on its own. Later this program would lead to the Leopard 2.

==XM803==

Work began on converting the existing MBT-70 design into a low-cost &quot;austere&quot; alternative that would use only American-made components, resulting in the visually similar XM803 prototype. Congress hoped to drive down the per-unit cost to $500,000–$600,000, saving $200,000 per tank versus the MBT-70.

The largest cost savings came from a switch to a less expensive steel armor plating. An American-made engine also reduced costs. The design was slightly heavier and slower. General Motors received a $16.5 million contract to develop the tank in July 1971. Systems were simplified or eliminated altogether to save costs. The XM150E5 gun-launcher was replaced with an XM150E6, which included a closed breech scavenging system. A 24-round General Motors autoloader was installed. Ammunition capacity was increased to 50 rounds. The commander&#x27;s 20 mm cannon was replaced by a .50 caliber M85 machine gun. The driver&#x27;s escape hatch was deleted and his television, as well as those of all the other crew, were eliminated. The Continental AVCR-1100-3B engine was derated to at 2600 rpm and paired to a General
Motors XHM-1500-2B transmission. A simplified National Water Lift hydropneumatic suspension was installed. Side skirts were installed, which allowed some armor to be removed from the hull. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army studied installing a gas-turbine AGT-1500 generating (this was the engine that would come to power the M1 Abrams).

Only one of the two pilot vehicles authorized for construction was completed. In addition, a surrogate vehicle based on the components of MBT-70 the M60 and the M88 armored recovery vehicle, was constructed.

These changes were ultimately insufficient to allay concerns about the tank&#x27;s cost. In September 1971, an amendment by Senator Thomas Eagleton was defeated that would cut $35.3 million in funding for XM803 prototype production. but in December 1971, Congress canceled the tank in the defense appropriation bill. The bill appropriated $20 million for cancelation costs and $20 million for the development of a new tank program. This became the XM1 design project, which led to the production-model M1 Abrams tank.

==Legacy==

In a post-mortem report of his four years on the project, American program manager Brig. Gen. Bernard Luczak attributed the high cost of the tank to the difficulties of managing a joint program. Luczak claimed General Motors charged a premium for its defense contract work, which it considered insignificant compared to its burgeoning automotive business.

In the 1989 book &quot;King of the Killing Zone&quot; author Orr Kelly called the end of the MBT-70 program, &quot;one of the most fortunate occurrences to befall the U.S. Army.&quot;

<text>Sir Henry Wotton (; 30 March 1568 – December 1639) was an English author, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1614 and 1625. When on a mission to Augsburg in 1604, he famously said &quot;An ambassador is an honest gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country&quot;.

==Life==
The son of Thomas Wotton (1521–1587) and his second wife, Elionora Finch, Henry was the youngest brother of Edward Wotton, and grandnephew of the diplomat Nicholas and Margaret Wotton. Henry was born at Bocton Hall in the parish of Bocton or Boughton Malherbe, Kent. He was educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 5 June 1584, alongside John Hoskins. Two years later, he moved to Queen&#x27;s College, graduating in 1588. 

At Oxford, he was the friend of Alberico Gentili, then professor of Civil Law, and of John Donne. During his residence at Queen&#x27;s, he wrote a play, &quot;Tancredo&quot;, which has not survived, but his chief interests appear to have been scientific. In qualifying for his M.A. degree he read three lectures &quot;De oculo&quot;, and to the end of his life, he continued to interest himself in physical experiments.

His father, Thomas Wotton, died in 1587, leaving Henry only a hundred marks a year. About 1589 Wotton went abroad, with a view probably to preparation for a diplomatic career, and his travels appear to have lasted for about six years. At Altdorf he met Edward, Lord Zouch, to whom he later addressed a series of letters (1590–1593) which contain much political and other news, and provide a record of the journey. He travelled by way of Vienna and Venice to Rome, and in 1593 spent some time at Geneva in the house of Isaac Casaubon, to whom he contracted a considerable debt.

He returned to England in 1594, and in the next year was admitted to the Middle Temple. While abroad he had from time to time provided Robert Devereux with information, and he now definitely entered his service as one of his agents or secretaries. It was his duty to supply intelligence of affairs in Transylvania, Poland, Italy and Germany. He served as Essex&#x27;s secretary in Ireland from 15 April 1599 until 4 September 1599. 

Wotton was not directly involved in the Essex Rebellion; this contrasts with his fellow-secretary, Henry Cuffe, who was hanged at Tyburn in 1601. However, he thought it prudent to leave England, and within sixteen hours of Essex&#x27;s apprehension he was safe in France, whence he travelled to Venice and Rome.

In 1602, he was living in Florence, and a plot to murder James VI of Scotland having come to the ears of the grand duke of Tuscany, Wotton was entrusted with letters to warn the king of the danger, and with Italian antidotes against poison. As &quot;Ottavio Baldi&quot; he travelled to Scotland by way of Norway. He was well received by James, and remained for three months at the Scottish court, retaining his Italian incognito. He then returned to Florence, but on receiving the news of James&#x27;s accession hurried to England. James knighted him, and offered him the embassy at Madrid or Paris; but Wotton, knowing that both these offices involved ruinous expense, desired rather to represent James at Venice.

He left London in 1604 accompanied by Sir Albertus Morton, his half-nephew, as secretary, and William Bedell, the author of an Irish translation of the Bible, as chaplain. Wotton spent most of the next twenty years, with two breaks (1612–16 and 1619–21), at Venice. He helped the Doge in his resistance to ecclesiastical aggression, and was closely associated with Paolo Sarpi, whose history of the Council of Trent was sent to King James as fast as it was written. Wotton had offended the scholar Caspar Schoppe, who had been a fellow student at Altdorf.

In 1611, Schoppe wrote a scurrilous book against James entitled &quot;Ecclesiasticus&quot;, in which he fastened on Wotton a saying which he had incautiously written in friend, Christoff Fleckhammer&#x27;s, album years before. It was the famous definition of an ambassador as an &quot;honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of his country&quot; (&quot;Legatus est vir bonus peregre missus ad mentiendum rei publicae causa&quot;). It should be noticed that the original Latin form of the epigram did not admit to the double meaning. This was adduced as an example of the morals of James and his servants, and brought Wotton into temporary disgrace. Wotton was at the time on leave in England, and made two formal defences of himself, one a personal attack on his accuser addressed to Mark Welser of Augsburg, and the other privately to the king.

He obtained no diplomatic employment for some time, but seems to have finally won back the royal favour by his parliamentary support for James&#x27;s claim to impose arbitrary taxes on merchandise. In 1614 he was elected Member of Parliament for Appleby in the Addled Parliament. 

He was sent to the Hague and, in 1616, he returned to Venice. In 1620 he was sent on a special embassy to Ferdinand II at Vienna, to do what he could on behalf of James&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth of Bohemia. Wotton&#x27;s devotion to this princess, expressed in his exquisite verses beginning &quot;You meaner beauties of the night,&quot; was sincere and unchanging. At his departure, the emperor presented him with a valuable jewel, which Wotton received with due respect, but before leaving the city he gave it to his hostess, because, he said, he would accept no gifts from the enemy of the Bohemian queen.

After a third term of service in Venice he returned to London early in 1624 and in July he was installed as provost of Eton College. This office did not resolve his financial problems, and he was on one occasion arrested for debt. In 1625 he was elected MP for Sandwich. 

In 1627, he received a pension of £200, and in 1630 this was raised to £500 on the understanding that he should write a history of England. He did not neglect the duties of his provostship, and was happy in being able to entertain his friends lavishly. His most constant associates were Izaak Walton and John Hales. A bend in the Thames below the Playing Fields, known as &quot;Black Potts,&quot; is still pointed out as the spot where Wotton and Walton fished in company. He died at the beginning of December 1639 and was buried in the chapel of Eton College.

==Works==
Of 25 poems printed in &quot;Reliquiae Wottonianae&quot; 15 are Wotton&#x27;s. Of those, two are well known, &quot;O his Mistris, the Queen of Bohemia,&quot; and &quot;The Character of a Happy Life&quot;. Another much-quoted work is his epitaph for Elizabeth Apsley, the widow of his nephew Sir Albertus Morton: &quot;He first deceased, she for a little tried to live without him, liked it not, and died&quot;.

During his lifetime he published two works: &quot;The Elements of Architecture&quot; (1624), which is a free translation of &quot;de Architectura&quot; by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, executed during his time in Venice; and a Latin prose address to the king on his return from Scotland (1633). Wotton shares authorship of the quote &quot;Well building hath three conditions: firmness, commodity, and delight&quot;, with Vitruvius, from whose &quot;de Architectura&quot; Wotton translated the phrase; some have termed his &quot;Elements&quot; a paraphrase rather than a true translation, and the quote is often attributed to Vitruvius.

In 1651 appeared the &quot;Reliquiae Wottonianiae&quot;, with Izaak Walton&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;.

<text>Caspar Schoppe (27 May 1576 – 19 November 1649) was a German catholic controversialist and scholar.

==Life==
He was born at Neumarkt in the upper Palatinate and studied at several German universities. He converted to Roman Catholicism in about 1599, after reading the &quot;Annales Ecclesiastici&quot; of Baronius.

Schoppe obtained the favour of Pope Clement VIII, and distinguished himself by the virulence of his writings against the Protestants. He became involved in a controversy with Joseph Justus Scaliger, formerly his intimate friend, and others; wrote &quot;Ecclesiasticus auctoritati Jacobi regis oppositus&quot; (1611), an attack upon James I of England; and in &quot;Classicum belli sacri&quot; (1619) urged the Catholic princes to wage war upon the Protestants. In about 1607, Schoppe entered the service of Ferdinand, archduke of Styria, afterwards Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, who found him very useful in rebutting the arguments of the Protestants, and who sent him on several diplomatic errands. According to Pierre Bayle, he was almost killed by some Englishmen at Madrid in 1614, and again fearing for his life he left Germany for Italy in 1617, afterwards taking part in an attack upon the Jesuits.

Anthony Grafton writes about Bayle and Scioppius: &quot;We owe to him [Bayle] the preservation of Caspar Scioppius&#x27; description of the sparrow he watched, from his student lodgings at Ingolstadt, having intercourse twenty times and then dying--as well as Scioppius&#x27; reflection, &#x27;O unfair lot. Is this to be granted to sparrows and denied to men?&#x27;&quot;

Schoppe died at Padua on 19 November 1649.

==Works==
In his &quot;Life of Sir Henry Wotton&quot; Izaak Walton, calling him Jasper Scioppius, refers to Schoppe as &quot;a man of a restless spirit and a malicious pen.&quot; More recent material appears in &quot;Wotton And His Worlds&quot; by Gerald Curzon (2004).

Schoppe&#x27;s major work is, perhaps, his &quot;Grammatica philosophica&quot; (Milan, 1628). He also wrote:
*&quot;De arte critica&quot; (1597)
*&quot;De Antichristo&quot; (1605)
*&quot;Pro auctoritate ecclesiae in decidendis fidei controversiis libellus&quot;
*&quot;Scaliger hypobolymaeus&quot; (1607), a virulent attack on Scaliger

Anti-jesuitical Works:
*&quot;Flagellum Jesuiticum&quot; (1632)
*&quot;Mysteria patrum jesuitorum&quot; (1633)
*&quot;Arcana societatis Jesu&quot; (1635).

For a fuller list of his writings see J. P. Nicéron &quot;Mémoires&quot;, (1727–1745). See also C. Nisard, &quot;Les Gladiateurs de la république des lettres&quot; (Paris. 1860).

<text>John Albert Elway Jr. (born June 28, 1960) is an American former professional football quarterback who spent his entire 16-year career with the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). Following his playing career, he then spent 11 years with the Broncos in various front office positions, eventually being promoted to general manager. Elway and former backup quarterback and head coach Gary Kubiak are the only individuals to be associated with all three of the Broncos&#x27; Super Bowl wins.

Elway is widely regarded as one of the best quarterbacks in the history of the sport. At the time of his retirement in early 1999, Elway had the most victories by a starting quarterback and was statistically the second most prolific passer in NFL history. He was also a prolific rusher of the ball, being one of only two players to score a rushing touchdown in four different Super Bowls (the other being Thurman Thomas) and the only quarterback to do so.

While playing college football at Stanford, Elway set several career records for passing attempts and completions and also received unanimous All-American honors. He was the first selection in the 1983 NFL draft, famously known as the &quot;quarterback class of 1983&quot;, where he was taken by the Baltimore Colts before being traded to the Denver Broncos. In January 1987, Elway embarked on one of the most notable performances in sports and in NFL history, helping engineer a 98-yard, game-tying touchdown drive in the AFC Championship Game against the Cleveland Browns, a moment later dubbed &quot;The Drive&quot;. Following that game in Cleveland, Elway and the Broncos lost in Super Bowl XXI to the New York Giants.

After two more Super Bowl losses, the Broncos entered a period of decline; however, that ended during the 1997 season, as Elway and Denver won their first Super Bowl title by defeating the Green Bay Packers 31–24 in Super Bowl XXXII. The Broncos repeated as champions the following season in Super Bowl XXXIII by defeating the Atlanta Falcons 34–19. Elway was named MVP of that Super Bowl, which was the last game of his career, and in doing so Elway set a then-record five Super Bowl starts which was broken in February 2015 when Tom Brady of the New England Patriots started Super Bowl XLIX. After his retirement as a player, Elway served as general manager and executive vice president of football operations of the Broncos, which won four division titles, two AFC Championships, and Super Bowl 50 during his tenure, making Elway a three-time Super Bowl Champion with the Broncos – two as a player and one as an executive. Elway was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Early life==
Elway and his twin sister Jana were born on June 28, 1960, in Port Angeles, Washington, to Janet (née Jordan) and Jack Elway, then the head coach at Port Angeles High School. The family of five included sister Lee Ann, a year older than the twins. They moved the following year to southwestern Washington, where Jack was the junior college head football coach at Grays Harbor Community College in Aberdeen for five seasons. As a youth, Elway lived primarily in Missoula, Montana, and Pullman, Washington, when his father was an assistant coach at Montana and Washington State, respectively.
In February 1976, Jack joined the staff at Palouse neighbor Idaho, but a month later became the head coach at Cal State-Northridge, a Division II program in Southern California. The family moved after John&#x27;s freshman year at Pullman High School to the San Fernando Valley, where he played his final three years of football at Granada Hills High School in Granada Hills, under head coaches Jack Neumeier and Tom Richards. Despite missing five games with a knee injury as a senior, he ended his high school career with 5,711 passing yards and 49 passing touchdowns, and was named to the &quot;Parade&quot; All America High School Football Team, along with future NFL stars, quarterback Dan Marino and running back Eric Dickerson.

Known as a dual-threat quarterback, meaning he was accomplished at running and escaping pressure with an impressive passing ability, he was amongst the top recruited high school players in the country, receiving numerous scholarships. One of those offers was from his father, who became the head coach at San Jose State following the 1978 season. Also an accomplished baseball player, Elway was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 18th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft. The Royals also selected Marino in the fourth round of the same draft.

==College career==
In 1979, Elway enrolled at Stanford University, where he played for the Stanford Cardinal football and baseball teams. Rod Gilmore recalled that the football team expected Elway to be a backup quarterback for three years before starting, like Turk Schonert and Steve Dils. After seeing the new player in preseason practice Babe Laufenberg and another backup transferred, knowing that Elway would be above them on the depth chart. Stanford was where the legend of the &quot;Elway cross&quot; began; after the freshman broke two players&#x27; fingers on the first day of practice, receivers began catching Elway&#x27;s passes with their bodies instead of hands, leaving a cross on their chests from the ball&#x27;s seams.

Elway spent his freshman season as backup to future NFL quarterback Schonert, playing in nine games as the team went 5–5–1. After Schonert graduated, Elway became the starting quarterback as a sophomore, threw 27 touchdown passes (2nd in the NCAA), and led the team to a 6–4 record heading into the final week of the season. In the Big Game against a 2–8 California team, Stanford was upset 28–23, dropping them to 6–5 and costing them a chance to play in a bowl game. In 1981, Elway had another fine season, ranking 7th in the NCAA with 20 touchdown passes, but the team finished the year with a dismal 4–7 record.

In his senior season in 1982, Stanford was 5–5 and needed to win its final game, The Big Game against Cal, to secure an invitation to the Hall of Fame Classic bowl game. With two minutes remaining in the game, Stanford was down 19–17 and had 4th-and-17 on their own 13-yard line. Elway completed a 29-yard pass and drove the ball downfield to the 35-yard line, where Mark Harmon kicked what appeared to be the winning field goal. However, the clock had four seconds remaining, so Stanford had to kick off. What followed is now simply known as &quot;The Play&quot;, in which Cal players lateraled the ball, rugby-style, five times – two of them controversial – and scored a touchdown to win the game, 25–20. Elway was bitter about the game afterward, stating that the officials &quot;ruined my last game as a college football player.&quot; Stanford athletics director Andy Geiger said the loss cost Elway the Heisman Trophy. Twenty years later, Elway came to terms with The Play, saying that &quot;each year it gets a little funnier.&quot;

Although Elway never led his team to a bowl game, he had an accomplished college career. In his four seasons (1979–1982) at Stanford, he completed 774 passes for 9,349 yards, 77 touchdowns, and 39 interceptions, while also scoring 5 touchdowns rushing the ball. Stanford had a 20–23 record during his tenure. Elway&#x27;s 24 touchdown passes in 1982 led the nation, and at the conclusion of his career, he held nearly every Pacific-10 record for passing and total offense. He won the Pac-10 Player of the Year honors in 1980 and 1982, was a unanimous All-American, and finished second in Heisman balloting as a senior. In 2000, Elway was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. In 2007, Elway was ranked #15 on ESPN&#x27;s Top 25 Players In College Football History list. He passed for over 200 yards in 30 of his 42 collegiate games.

Elway also excelled as a baseball player. He was selected by the New York Yankees in the second round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft (52nd overall, six spots ahead of future Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn), and received $150,000 for playing for the Yankees&#x27; short season affiliate Oneonta Yankees in the New York–Penn League in the summer of 1982. Many scouts saw Elway as a good baseball player, but not as likely a star as in football. Yankees scout Gary Hughes believed, however, that if Elway concentrated on baseball &quot;the sky was the limit … he would&#x27;ve been off the charts&quot;. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner—who aggressively sought Elway&#x27;s services—reportedly planned to make him the Yankees&#x27; starting right fielder by 1985, which Elway—aware of Steinbrenner&#x27;s opinion—later described as &quot;a tremendous [and] exciting thought&quot;.

Elway graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics, and is a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Already age 19 when he entered as a freshman, Elway did not use a redshirt year at Stanford.

==Professional career==

===1983 NFL draft===
The Baltimore Colts had the first overall pick in the 1983 NFL draft, nicknamed the &quot;Quarterback class of 1983&quot;. Elway was the first of six quarterbacks selected in the first round. Elway was wary of playing for the Colts, among the worst teams in the league at the time, and his father advised him against playing for head coach Frank Kush, who had a reputation as a harsh taskmaster. While Elway preferred football, his agent Marvin Demoff later stated that baseball was &quot;a true option&quot; for him at the time. The possibility gave Elway leverage in negotiations with the Colts.

Elway told the Colts in December 1982 that he did not want to play for the team, and later told the Colts that he wanted to play on the West Coast or for the Dallas Cowboys or Miami Dolphins. After unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a private agreement with the Colts in which Elway would cite his alleged desire to remain on the West Coast to explain the team trading him, Elway publicly threatened to join the Yankees full-time if the Colts did not trade him; Demoff wrote in his journal, published three decades later, that &quot;he would be a garbage collector before he&#x27;d play for Baltimore.&quot; Elway&#x27;s refusal to join the Colts was controversial – Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw denounced him, stating &quot;you should play baseball … he&#x27;s not the kind of guy you win championships with&quot; – but many other NFL teams began negotiations with the Colts for the quarterback. One possibility was trading Elway for the San Francisco 49ers&#x27; Joe Montana, whose team had a poor season in 1982. Another was a trade with the San Diego Chargers, who were negotiating a new contract with starting quarterback Dan Fouts. The New England Patriots were interested, but the Colts did not wish to trade Elway to a team in the same division. The Los Angeles Raiders almost traded for Elway the day before the draft, but the Raiders could not complete a required trade with the Chicago Bears; they ultimately drafted one spot ahead of the Dolphins and were the last team to pass on Marino. The Cowboys, who were Elway&#x27;s favorite team as a child, came the closest to completing a deal and had an ace in the hole by offering existing starting quarterback Danny White (who had played under Kush at Arizona State) in exchange for Elway, as Kush and Tom Landry had been friends. However, Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm was unable to get through to Colts owner Robert Irsay, with Gil Brandt adding years later that they would have likely been able to complete the deal if not for Irsay.

With no successful trade before the draft, the Colts had to draft Elway and possibly trade him later. Team general manager Ernie Accorsi wanted Elway as, Accorsi later said, he did not foresee the 1984 draft as producing any first-round quarterbacks. Accorsi announced Elway as the team&#x27;s choice as soon as possible during the 15-minute window on draft day, surprising observers, but Kush already told Elway&#x27;s family by phone that the Colts would pick him regardless of baseball. Elway that day reiterated his wish to not play for the Colts at a press conference, saying &quot;As I stand here right now, I&#x27;m playing baseball&quot;. When a reporter pointed out that the Yankees were not based on the West Coast, Elway replied &quot;They play baseball during the summertime&quot;. Jack Elway said that John &quot;will never play for Irsay or Coach Kush&quot;.

Worried that the Colts would waste their pick, Irsay began negotiating with the Denver Broncos before the draft. The Colts were interested in offensive lineman Chris Hinton, whom the Broncos chose as the fourth pick in the first round. On May 2, Irsay and Accorsi agreed to trade Elway for Hinton, backup quarterback Mark Herrmann, and a first-round pick in the 1984 draft, which turned into offensive lineman Ron Solt. The Colts&#x27; controversial relocation to Indianapolis the following year would later prove to somewhat vindicate Jack Elway&#x27;s concerns, and the team would largely struggle until the arrival of Peyton Manning during Elway&#x27;s last season as a player.

===Denver Broncos===
As one of the best quarterbacks drafted, Elway joined Denver as one of the most highly anticipated athletes in the history of the NFL. The local newspapers ran a section that was called &quot;The Elway Watch&quot;. After Craig Morton retired after the 1982 season and Herrmann was traded, the press expected that Elway might become the starting quarterback during the 1983 season. He debuted for the Broncos in the season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium, and was sacked for the first time in his NFL career at the hands of linebacker and fellow Hall of Famer Jack Lambert. In his first game, Elway was relieved by veteran quarterback Steve DeBerg, who led the Broncos to a victory. Elway&#x27;s second game was also on the road at Baltimore, and was spirited by his rejection of the franchise. In what would turn out to be Elway&#x27;s only professional game in Baltimore, Elway was again relieved in a close game by DeBerg, who led the Broncos to another win. In early October, DeBerg was named the starter by third-year head coach Dan Reeves for the remainder of the season, but a shoulder injury brought Elway back a month later.

In the 1986 season, Elway led the Broncos to Super Bowl XXI, after defeating the Cleveland Browns on a famous possession at the end of the fourth quarter that became known as &quot;The Drive&quot;. In a span of 5 minutes and 2 seconds, Elway led his team 98 yards to tie the game with 37 seconds left in regulation. The Broncos won the game in overtime. Elway and the Broncos started out the Super Bowl against the New York Giants very well, building a 10–7 lead and then driving to the Giants 1-yard line in the second quarter. However, the Broncos lost five yards on their next three plays and came up empty after kicker Rich Karlis missed the field goal attempt. From that point on, the rest of the game went downhill for the Broncos. Elway was sacked in the end zone for a safety on the Broncos ensuing possession, cutting their lead to 10–9. Then in the second half, the Giants scored 30 points and ended up winning the game 39–20. Still, Elway had an impressive performance, throwing 304 yards, a touchdown, and an interception, while also leading Denver in rushing with 27 yards and a touchdown on the ground.
In the 1987 season, Elway was selected to start in the American Football Conference&#x27;s (AFC) Pro Bowl team and won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award. He went on to once again lead the Broncos to a victory over the Browns in the AFC title game, earning their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance, this one against the Washington Redskins. The game started out very well for Denver, and they built up a 10–0 lead by the end of the first quarter. At the time, no team had overcome a 10–0 deficit in the Super Bowl. But in the second quarter, the Redskins suddenly stormed back with a record 35 points, and ended up winning Super Bowl XXII 42–10. Elway did have a few highlights. His 56-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Nattiel after just 1:57 had elapsed in the game set a record for the fastest touchdown in Super Bowl history, at the time. He also became the first quarterback to catch a pass in the Super Bowl, recording a 23-yard reception from halfback Steve Sewell on a halfback option play. With a porous defense unable to stop the Redskins offense, Elway was forced to take more risks on the offensive end. As a result, Elway&#x27;s performance was rather disappointing: just 14 out of 38 completions for 257 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions.

Gilmore, who regretted not helping Elway win a Heisman (&quot;Had we focused a little more on what we were doing, we could have made things easier on John&quot;), thought that the Broncos were, like their Stanford teams, overdependent on Elway: &quot;when one player is head and shoulders better than the rest of the team ... people come to expect the star will always save the day&quot;. After recording an 8–8 record in 1988, Elway once again led his team to the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. However, this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55–10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn&#x27;t try to hide from the media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And when he was asked if he wanted to go back to the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, even if his team kept losing. However, many doubted that he would win a Super Bowl in his career.

It took Elway another eight years, but he eventually led his team back to the Super Bowl, following the 1997 season. During the preseason American Bowl game in Mexico City, Elway ruptured his right (throwing arm) biceps tendon. It was treated non-surgically, and he returned to play 19 days later, and the team advanced to Super Bowl XXXII, Elway&#x27;s fourth, where they faced the Green Bay Packers, the defending champions. Despite Elway completing only 11 of 22 passes, throwing no touchdowns and one interception, the Broncos defeated the Packers 31–24, winning their first Super Bowl, after three failed attempts for Elway (and four for the team).

In the 1998 season, the Broncos repeated this feat and Elway was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXIII, throwing 336 yards, a touchdown, and an interception, while also scoring a rushing touchdown in Denver&#x27;s 34–19 win over the Atlanta Falcons. It was his last game, other than the 1999 Pro Bowl.

===Legacy===

On May 2, 1999, at age 38, Elway announced his retirement from professional football. Elway is regarded as one of the top quarterbacks to play the game. He has one of the best winning percentages in league history (148–82–1), and was tied for the second-most Pro Bowl selections for a quarterback (nine) at the time of his retirement. Elway played in 22 postseason games with the Broncos, 21 as a starter, and led the team to victory in 14 of them. In those games he threw 4,964 yards and 27 touchdowns, with 21 interceptions, while also rushing for 461 yards and 6 more scores. He is currently 9th all time in passing yards, 10th in passes completed, and 12th in passing touchdowns. His four total rushing touchdowns in his Super Bowl games are the most by a quarterback. He is also the second player to score a rushing touchdown in four different Super Bowls (running back Thurman Thomas was the first).

On September 13, 1999, Elway&#x27;s number 7 jersey was retired by the Denver Broncos during halftime of a Monday Night game against the Miami Dolphins; that same night he was inducted into the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame. Craig Morton, his direct predecessor in Denver, also wore number 7 and is in the Ring of Fame alongside Elway. He was the first Broncos player to have the five-year waiting period waived. Also in 1999 he was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame.

Also in 1999, Elway was ranked number 16 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the only player to have spent the majority of his career with the Broncos to make the list; Willie Brown, who began his career with the Broncos but spent more of it with the Oakland Raiders, also made the list. In 2005, &quot;TSN&quot; published another special feature honoring the 50 Greatest Quarterbacks. Elway was ranked third behind Johnny Unitas and Joe Montana.

Elway was named the greatest athlete wearing the #7 by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who grew up idolizing Elway and Joe Montana, wore number 7 in honor of Elway during his entire 18-year career.

===Notable statistics===
Elway ended his career with a record 148 victories, since surpassed by Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, and Tom Brady for most wins by a starting quarterback. He finished his career with 774 rushing attempts, currently fourth in league history behind Cam Newton (934), Michael Vick (873), and Randall Cunningham (775). Elway&#x27;s 3,407 rushing yards ranks seventh all-time among NFL QB&#x27;s behind Cunningham, Vick, Newton, Steve Young, Fran Tarkenton, and Steve McNair.

Elway threw 1,128 yards in his five Super Bowls, fourth most behind Tom Brady, Kurt Warner, and Joe Montana. His 76 Super Bowl pass completions rank fifth, and his 152 attempts were a Super Bowl record before being broken by Tom Brady. He is one of only two players to score a rushing touchdown in four different Super Bowls (the other being Thurman Thomas) and the only quarterback to do so, with 156 attempts.

===Career highlights===
* In 1979, Elway was drafted out of high school by the Kansas City Royals to play baseball in Major League Baseball. George Brett, the future Hall of Fame third baseman for the Royals, remarked, &quot;They said: &#x27;talk this guy into playing baseball. We didn&#x27;t do a very good job, thank God, because he probably would have taken my job.&quot;
* In the 1981 MLB Draft, Elway was selected by the New York Yankees in the second round. The following year, he played outfield in 42 games for the Oneonta Yankees of the Class A New York–Penn League. He had a .318 batting average, with four home runs, 13 stolen bases, and a team-high 25 RBI.

==Business activities==
Elway was co-owner of the Arena Football team Colorado Crush from their inception in 2002 until the cancellation of the Arena Football League after the 2008 season. In February 2007, Elway was elected chairman of the AFL&#x27;s executive committee. On August 4, 2009, the Arena Football League announced an indefinite suspension of operations. Elway was one of the 17 remaining franchise owners that voted to suspend operations indefinitely.

Elway is the owner of four steakhouse restaurants, each named &quot;Elway&#x27;s&quot;: One is located in the upscale Cherry Creek shopping district, one in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in downtown Denver, one in Vail, and one in the Denver International Airport.

Elway owned five auto dealerships, called John Elway Autos, in the Denver area. He sold them to AutoNation Inc. in 1997 for $82.5 million. In December 2006, Elway ended a nine-year licensing agreement with AutoNation, removing his name from Denver-area dealerships. At the time, Elway said the move could allow him to get back into the auto business under his own name. He still owns two Toyota Scion dealerships, one in Manhattan Beach, California and another in Ontario, California, a Chevrolet dealership in Englewood, Colorado, and a Chrysler Jeep dealership in Greeley, Colorado. Elway acquired a Cadillac franchise from Sonic Automotive in 2014.

In September 2008, Elway became the spokesperson for OpenSports.com.

Elway had LASIK eye surgery and endorsed Icon LASIK in the Denver area in November 2008.

Elway currently offers his commentary on the Broncos and the NFL season as a whole Friday mornings during the football season on 87.7 The Ticket in Denver.

Elway is part of a national awareness campaign about Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture, with which he was diagnosed in 2004.

==Executive career==
In December 2010, Elway expressed interest in working as the Broncos&#x27; top football executive after having dinner with Broncos owner Pat Bowlen. However, he stressed he did not wish to be a head coach or general manager after Josh McDaniels&#x27; firing, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in being a head coach. I&#x27;m not interested in being a general manager. I don&#x27;t have that kind of experience to be able to pick those players day in and day out and such.&quot;

On January 5, 2011, Elway was named general manager and executive vice president of football operations of the Broncos, with the final say in all football matters. In this capacity, he reported to team president Joe Ellis and was the immediate supervisor for the head coach of the team. General manager Brian Xanders was actually retained, but served mostly in an advisory role to Elway. Xanders left the team after the 2012 season, and Elway assumed the role of general manager which gave him complete control over the football side of the Broncos operation.

Under Elway&#x27;s management, the team signed free agent quarterback Peyton Manning, who was just released by the Indianapolis Colts. In four seasons from 2012 to 2015, the Broncos won four division titles, two AFC Championships, and reached Super Bowl XLVIII where they were soundly defeated 43–8 by the Seattle Seahawks despite holding the regular season&#x27;s top offense.

Elway responded to the Super Bowl loss by signing defensive end DeMarcus Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib, and safety T. J. Ward for the 2014 season. After losing in the divisional playoffs to the Indianapolis Colts, Elway dismissed John Fox, who won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach.

Elway hired Gary Kubiak, his former backup quarterback and former Broncos offensive coordinator, as the new head coach for the 2015 season. Elway and Kubiak also brought back Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach, for his second stint as the team&#x27;s defensive coordinator. Elway won a third Super Bowl as part of the Broncos franchise, on February 7, 2016, when Denver defeated the Carolina Panthers 24–10 in Super Bowl 50. This gave him his first Super Bowl win as Executive VP/GM, to go along with the two he won as the team&#x27;s quarterback.

In 2017, Elway received the Mizel Institute Award for his philanthropic contributions to Denver and the state of Colorado.

Elway tested positive for COVID-19 in November 2020, and returned to the team on November 12. Following the 2020 season, Elway announced that he would step down as general manager but continue to serve as the Broncos&#x27; president of football operations. He was succeeded as general manager by George Paton.

In February 2022, Elway took on a new position as an outside consultant that reports directly to Paton. As of April 2023, Elway had no contractual affiliation with the Denver Broncos and his official role with the club had ended.

In 2024, Elway competed in season twelve of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Leaf Sheep&quot; which was part vehicle and had DeMarcus Ware (who portrayed &quot;Koala&quot; in season eleven) as his Mask Ambassador. He was the first of Group A to be eliminated in the season premiere.

==Personal life==
Elway married Janet Buchan, who attended Stanford University and competed on its swimming team, in 1984. They separated in 2002 and divorced in 2003. They have four children: Jessica, Jordan, Jack, and Juliana.

Elway&#x27;s twin sister, Jana, developed lung cancer and died at the age of 42 in the summer of 2002. John&#x27;s father, Jack, died of an apparent heart attack a year earlier.

Elway met former Oakland Raiders cheerleader Paige Green in 2005 at a celebrity golf tournament held by former Raiders running back Marcus Allen in Los Angeles. They were engaged in Italy in September 2008, and married in August 2009.

Elway is a Freemason.

<text>Old Dominion University (ODU) is a public research university in Norfolk, Virginia, United States. Established in 1930 as the two-year Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary, it began by educating people with fewer financial assets in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area of the Hampton Roads region. Later Virginia Polytechnic Institute also began offering classes for the Division. The Division became independent from William and Mary in 1962 and has since expanded into a residential college for traditional students and is one of the largest universities in Virginia with an enrollment of 23,494 students for the 2023 academic year. The university also enrolls over 600 international students from 99 countries. Its main campus covers straddling the city neighborhoods of Larchmont, Highland Park, and Lambert&#x27;s Point, approximately north of Downtown Norfolk along the Elizabeth River.

The university offers 175 undergraduate and graduate degree programs from seven colleges and three schools. Deriving its name from one of Virginia&#x27;s state nicknames, &quot;The Old Dominion&quot;, given to the state by King Charles II of England for remaining loyal to the crown during the English Civil War, Old Dominion has approximately 165,000 alumni in all 50 states and 67 countries.

ODU has a Carnegie Classification of &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, ODU spent $73.6 million on research and development in 2021. For 2024-2025, WSJ/College Pulse ranked Old Dominion #501-600 out of U.S. universities while &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the university #278 out of U.S. universities and #973 out of global universities.

==History==
Old Dominion University was founded in 1930 as a Norfolk extension of the College of William and Mary. This branch was envisioned by administrators and officials such as Robert M. Hughes, a member of the Board of Visitors of William and Mary from 1893 to 1917, and J. A. C. Chandler, the eighteenth president of that school. In 1924 after becoming the director of the William and Mary extension in Norfolk, Joseph Healy began organizing classes and finding locations for faculty and staff. Due to his work, along with that of Robert M. Hughes, J. A. C. Chandler, and A. H. Foreman, a two-year branch division was established on March 13, 1930. On September 12, 1930, the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary held its first class with 206 students (125 men and 81 women) in the old Larchmont School building, an unused elementary school on Hampton Boulevard. On September 3, 1930, H. Edgar Timmerman became the Division&#x27;s first director.

&quot;The Division&quot;, as it was often called, started in the old Larchmont School building and allowed people with fewer financial assets to attend a school of higher education for two years. Tuition for the first year was US$50. The following September, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, more commonly known as Virginia Tech, also began offering classes at &quot;The Division.&quot;, expanding course offerings to teachers and engineers. Created as it was in the first year of the Great Depression, the college benefited from federal funding as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. The Public Works Administration provided funds for the Administration Building, now Rollins Hall, and Foreman Field, named after A. H. Foreman, an early proponent of the college. The college grew south along Hampton Boulevard, turning an empty field into a sprawling campus.

In 1932, Lewis Warrington Webb joined the faculty as an instructor of engineering; he would later be called &quot;the Father of Old Dominion&quot;. After serving ten years as an instructor at the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary, Webb was appointed assistant director in 1942. Webb also served as director of the Defense and War Training Program from 1940 to 1944. Through its defense and training classes, the Norfolk Division contributed to the American WWII war effort. The program also allowed the school to remain open during a period when many young men were in the armed service. The program attracted many women, who learned aircraft repair, drafting, and other war-related subjects. In 1946, Webb was appointed Director of the Norfolk Division. Webb&#x27;s dream was to see the Norfolk Division become an independent institution.The two-year Norfolk Division rapidly evolved into a four-year institution, gaining independence from William and Mary in 1962. On February 16, 1962, the William and Mary system was dissolved under General Assembly legislation that was signed by Governor Albertis S. Harrison. Later that year the Norfolk Division was renamed Old Dominion College. Webb served as the first president of Old Dominion College from 1962 to 1969.

Frank Batten, who was the publisher of &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; and &quot;The Ledger-Star&quot; and a member of the Norfolk Division&#x27;s advisory board, was chosen as the first rector of Old Dominion College on May 27, 1962, holding the position until 1970. (The College of Engineering was named in his honor in 2004.) In 1964, the first students lived on campus in dormitories Rogers Hall and Gresham Hall, named for members of the advisory board.

Growth in enrollment, expansion of research facilities, and preparation for graduate programs led the board to seek university status. In 1969, Old Dominion College transitioned to Old Dominion University under the leadership of President James L. Bugg Jr. During Bugg&#x27;s tenure, the earliest doctoral programs were established, along with a university-wide governance structure with representation from faculty, administrators, and students. Bugg also reestablished the Army ROTC program that had been created in 1948 but abandoned during the Korean War.
In the 1970s, under President Alfred B. Rollins Jr., Old Dominion established partnerships between regional organizations such as , Eastern Virginia Medical School and Norfolk State University. Under Rollins, the university expanded its state and private funding, improved student services, and introduced an honors program. In 1971 Old Dominion University established its own police force and hired several officers to attend the Tidewater Police Academy. In 1977 the Virginia General Assembly passed the Campus Police Act giving public campus police officers full law enforcement authority.

Since this time, the university has continued to expand, now enrolling over 24,000 students. The Norfolk campus has experienced significant growth in both student population and geography. Additionally, ODU has established satellite campuses in Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, and Hampton.

In 2022, the university announced a $500 million capital campaign.

==Academics==
As a comprehensive university, Old Dominion University offers and develops humanities, science, health sciences, technology, engineering, business, arts, education, and professional programs. The university offers 73 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 60 master&#x27;s degrees, and 35 doctoral degrees in a wide range of fields.

Because Hampton Roads is a major international maritime and commerce center, the university has a special mission for the Commonwealth of Virginia in commerce, and in international affairs and cultures. With the principal marine and aerospace activities of the Commonwealth concentrated in Hampton Roads, the university has a significant commitment to science, engineering, and technology, specifically in marine science, aerospace, and other fields of major importance to the region. Many departments conduct cooperative research with NASA. ODU is one of the few universities in the US to offer MBA concentrations in maritime, transportation, and port logistics management and also has well-respected programs in marine science and coastal and transportation engineering. Due to its location in a large metropolitan area, Old Dominion University places particular emphasis on urban issues, including education and health care, and the arts.

<text>Pierre Bayle (; 18 November 1647 – 28 December 1706) was a French philosopher, author, and lexicographer. He is best known for his &quot;Historical and Critical Dictionary&quot;, whose publication began in 1697. Many of the more controversial ideas in the book were hidden away in the voluminous footnotes, or they were slipped into articles on seemingly uncontroversial topics. Bayle is commonly regarded as a forerunner of the &quot;Encyclopédistes&quot; of the mid-18th century.

A Huguenot, Bayle fled to the Dutch Republic in 1681 because of religious persecution in France. Bayle was a notable advocate of religious toleration, and his skeptical philosophy had a significant influence on the subsequent growth and development of the European Age of Enlightenment. Leibniz&#x27;s theodicy was formed in response to Bayle.
==Biography==
Bayle was born at Carla-le-Comte (later renamed Carla-Bayle in his honour), near Pamiers, Ariège, France. He was educated by his father, a Calvinist minister, and at an academy at Puylaurens. In 1669, he entered a Jesuit college at Toulouse and became a Roman Catholic a month later. After seventeen months, he returned to Calvinism and fled to Geneva, where he learned about the teachings of René Descartes. He returned to France and went to Paris, where for some years he worked under the name of Bèle as a tutor for various families. In 1675, he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Protestant Academy of Sedan. In 1681, the university at Sedan was suppressed by the government in action against Protestants.

Just before that event, Bayle had fled to the Dutch Republic, where he almost immediately was appointed professor of philosophy and history at the École Illustre in Rotterdam. He taught for many years but became embroiled in a long, internal quarrel in the college that resulted in Bayle being deprived of his chair in 1693.

Bayle remained in Rotterdam until his death on 28 December 1706. He was buried in Rotterdam in the Walloon church, where Pierre Jurieu would also be buried seven years later. After the demolition of this church in 1922, the graves were relocated to the Crooswijk General Cemetery in Rotterdam. A memorial stone shows that Pierre Bayle is in these graves.
==Writings==
At Rotterdam, Bayle published his famous &quot;&quot; in 1682, as well as his critique of Louis Maimbourg&#x27;s work on the history of Calvinism. The reputation achieved by this critique stirred the envy of Pierre Jurieu, Bayle&#x27;s Calvinist colleague of both Sedan and Rotterdam, who had written a book on the same subject.

Between 1684 and 1687, Bayle published his &quot;Nouvelles de la république des lettres&quot;, a journal of literary criticism. In 1686, Bayle published the first two volumes of &quot;Philosophical Commentary&quot;, an early plea for toleration in religious matters. This was followed by volumes three and four in 1687 and 1688.

In 1690 there appeared a work entitled &quot;Avis important aux refugiés&quot;, which Jurieu attributed to Bayle, whom he attacked with great animosity. After losing his chair, Bayle engaged in the preparation of his massive &quot;Dictionnaire Historique et Critique&quot; (&quot;Historical and Critical Dictionary&quot;), which effectively constituted one of the first encyclopaedias (before the term had come into wide circulation) of ideas and their originators. In the &quot;Dictionary&quot;, Bayle expressed his view that much that was considered to be &quot;truth&quot; was actually just opinion, and that gullibility and stubbornness were prevalent. The &quot;Dictionary&quot; would remain an important scholarly work for several generations after its publication.

The remaining years of Bayle&#x27;s life were devoted to miscellaneous writings; in many cases, he was responding to criticisms made of his &quot;Dictionary&quot;.

Voltaire, in the prelude to his &quot;Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne&quot;, calls Bayle &quot;le plus grand dialecticien qui ait jamais écrit&quot;: the greatest dialectician to have ever written.

The &quot;Nouvelles de la république des lettres&quot; was the first thoroughgoing attempt to popularise literature, and it was eminently successful. His multi-volume &quot;Historical and Critical Dictionary&quot; constitutes Bayle&#x27;s masterpiece. The English translation of &quot;The Dictionary&quot;, by Bayle&#x27;s fellow Huguenot exile Pierre des Maizeaux, was identified by American President Thomas Jefferson to be among the one hundred foundational texts to form the first collection of the Library of Congress.

===Views on toleration===
Bayle advanced arguments for religious toleration in his &quot;Dictionnaire historique et critique&quot; and &quot;Commentaire Philosophique&quot;. Bayle rejected the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence: &quot;One must transcribe almost the whole New Testament to collect all the Proofs it affords us of that Gentleness and Long-suffering, which constitute the distinguishing and essential Character of the Gospel.&quot; He did not regard toleration as a danger to the state; on the contrary: 
&quot;If the Multiplicity of Religions prejudices the State, it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavouring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of Persecution. In a word, all the Mischief arises not from Toleration, but from the want of it.&quot;

===Skepticism===
Richard Popkin has advanced the view that Pierre Bayle was a skeptic who used the &quot;Historical and Critical Dictionary&quot; to criticise all prior known theories and philosophies. In Bayle&#x27;s view, humans were inherently incapable of achieving true knowledge. Because of the limitations of human reason, men should adhere instead to their conscience alone. Bayle was critical of many influential rationalists, such as René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Nicolas Malebranche and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, as well as empiricists such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Isaac Newton. Popkin quotes the following passage as an example of Bayle&#x27;s skeptical viewpoint:

It [reason] is a guide that leads one astray; and philosophy can be compared to some powders that are so corrosive that, after they have eaten away the infected flesh of a wound, they then devour the living flesh, rot the bones, and penetrate to the very marrow. Philosophy at first refutes errors. But if it is not stopped at this point, it goes on to attack truths. And when it is left on its own, it goes so far that it no longer knows where it is and can find no stopping place.

<text>Pierre Jurieu (24 December 1637 – 11 January 1713) was a French Protestant leader.

==Life==
He was born at Mer, in Orléanais, where his father was a Protestant pastor. He studied at the Academy of Saumur and the Academy of Sedan under his grandfather, Pierre Du Moulin, and under Leblanc de Beaulieu. After completing his studies in the Netherlands and England, Jurieu was ordained as an Anglican priest; returning to France he was ordained again and succeeded his father as pastor of the church at Mer. Soon after this he published his first work, &quot;Examen de livre de la reunion du Christianisme&quot; (1671). In 1674 his &quot;Traité de la dévotion&quot; led to his appointment as professor of theology and Hebrew at Sedan, where he soon became pastor.

A year later he published his &quot;Apologie pour la morale des Reformés&quot;. His reputation was damaged by his argumentative nature, which sometimes descended into fanaticism, despite his sincerity. He was called by his adversaries &quot;the Goliath of the Protestants.&quot; On the suppression of the academy of Sedan in 1681, Jurieu received an invitation to a church at Rouen, but, afraid to remain in France on account of his forthcoming work, &quot;La Politique du clergé de France&quot;, he went to Holland and was pastor of the Walloon church of Rotterdam until his death. He was also professor at the &quot;école illustre&quot;.

From the 1690s, Jurieu was the founder and one of the main organizers of a spy network in France. Based in Rotterdam, the organization had agents in all the major French ports. From the beginning, Etienne Caillaud wrote and decrypted messages for Jurieu. The work was funded by a number of Huguenots, but also by William III and Anthonie Heinsius.

==Works==

Jurieu did much to help those who suffered by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685). He turned for consolation to the Apocalypse, and succeeded in persuading himself (&quot;Accomplissement des propheties&quot;, 1686) that the overthrow of the Antichrist (i.e. the Pope) would take place in 1689. HM Baird wrote that &quot;this persuasion, however fanciful the grounds on which it was based, exercised no small influence in forwarding the success of the designs of William of Orange in the invasion of England&quot;. Jurieu defended the doctrines of Protestantism against the attacks of Antoine Arnauld, Pierre Nicole and Jacques-Benigne Bossuet but was equally ready to enter into dispute with his fellow Protestants (with Louis Du Moulin and Claude Payon, for instance) when their opinions differed from his own even on minor matters. The bitterness and persistency of his attacks on his colleague Pierre Bayle led to the latter being deprived of his chair in 1693.

One of Jurieu&#x27;s chief works is &quot;Lettres pastorales adressées aux fidéles de France&quot; (3 vols., Rotterdam, 1686-1687; Eng. trans., 1689), which, notwithstanding the vigilance of the police, found its way into France and produced a deep impression on the Protestant population. In these &quot;Pastoral Letters&quot;, Jurieu supports before Jean-Jacques Rousseau the thesis of an explicit or implicit contract between the sovereign and his subjects; this idea will be opposed by Bossuet in the fifth of his &quot;Avertissements aux Protestants&quot; (1689–1691).

Jurieu&#x27;s last important work was the &quot;Histoire critique des dogmes et des cultes&quot; (1704). He wrote a great number of controversial works.

<text>Jackie Mason (born Yacov Moshe Maza; ; June 9, 1928 – July 24, 2021) was an American stand-up comedian and actor.

His 1986 one-man show &quot;The World According to Me!&quot; won a Special Tony Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, an Ace Award, an Emmy Award, and earned a Grammy nomination. Later, his 1988 special &quot;Jackie Mason on Broadway&quot; won another Emmy Award (for outstanding writing) and another Ace Award, and his 1991 voice-over of Rabbi Hyman Krustofski in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; won Mason a third Emmy Award. He wrote and performed six one-man shows on Broadway.

Known for his delivery and voice, as well as his use of innuendo and pun, Mason&#x27;s often culturally grounded humor was described as irreverent and sometimes politically incorrect. A critic for &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that, throughout his career, Mason spoke to audiences: &quot;... with the Yiddish locutions of an immigrant who just completed a course in English.

Jackie Mason was born Yacov Moshe Maza on June 9, 1928 (according to the 1940 NYC census), in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, the fourth and last son (and only son born in the United States) in a family of six children of strict Orthodox Jews. Mason came from a long line of rabbis, which included his father, his grandfather, his great-grandfather, and his great-great grandfather.

His father Eli Maza and his mother, Belle (Gitlin), were born in Minsk, and immigrated to the U.S. in the 1920s with the rest of Mason&#x27;s family; his father died in 1959. A Jewish refugee organization helped his father find a position in Sheboygan, as it needed a rabbi. When Mason was five years old, his family moved to the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, largely so that he and his siblings could pursue a yeshiva education, where he grew up on Henry Street, Rutgers Street, and Norfolk Street. There, his parents and their friends all spoke Yiddish.

As a teenager, Mason worked as a busboy at resorts in the Borscht Belt in New York&#x27;s Catskill Mountains. He recalled: &quot;Twenty minutes, at the Pearl Lake Hotel. I broke all the dishes. They made me a lifeguard. &#x27;But I can&#x27;t swim&#x27;, I told the owner. &#x27;Don&#x27;t tell the guests&#x27;, he says.&quot;

In 1953 Mason graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in his double major of English and sociology from the City College of New York. At age 18 he became a cantor, and at age 25 he received &quot;semikhah&quot; from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and was ordained a rabbi (as his three brothers, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had been). He led congregations in Weldon, North Carolina, and at Beth Israel Congregation in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. He said that in synagogue, &quot;I started telling more and more jokes, and after a while, a lot of gentiles would come to the congregation just to hear the sermons.&quot; Three years later, after his father died, he resigned from his job as a rabbi in a synagogue to become a comedian because, he said, &quot;Somebody in the family had to make a living.&quot;

==Career==

===Early years===
Mason wrote most of his own material. A sampling of his humor is his commentary on doctors: &quot;That&#x27;s a great profession, a doctor. Where else can you ask a woman to get undressed and then send the bill to her husband?&quot; And his commentary on what is important in life: &quot;Money is not important. Love is important. Fortunately, I love money.&quot; As well as his ruminations on pleasing people: &quot;You can&#x27;t please everyone. I have a girlfriend. I think she&#x27;s the most wonderful person in the world. That&#x27;s to me. But to my wife ...&quot; And on trust: &quot;My grandfather always said that I shouldn&#x27;t watch my money. That I should watch my health. So while I was watching my health, someone stole my money. It was my grandfather.&quot; And on fidelity: &quot;Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe.&quot;

He was a comedian at the Fieldston Hotel in Swan Lake, New York, in the summer of 1955. Mason was let go because his act was considered too far ahead of its time. The patrons had not been exposed to a comic who seemed to be ridiculing them. A few years later, Don Rickles came along, but at that point audiences had become open to this type of humor throughout the Borscht Belt. He adopted his stage name after appearing on the Barry Gray radio show. He performed at New York City nightclubs (where he was earning as much as $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) a week), and on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, his first national TV appearance, in 1962, and the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; with Steve Allen, as well as on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, and &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;. The William Morris Agency advised him in 1962 to take elocution lessons so that he could shed his heavy Yiddish accent, but he refused.
Mason made several appearances as a guest on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; during the 1960s. He claimed to have been on the episode which featured the American television debut of the Beatles, but he did not appear on any of the three shows that featured the Beatles. Mason stated during his appearance on the BBC show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, in March 2012, that at the time he did not think much of the group, referring to them as &quot;four kids in search of a voice who needed haircuts&quot;. It is possible that he confused the Beatles with The Animals, who appeared on the same show as Mason on October 18, 1964, to a similar audience of screaming young girls.

In 1962 he came out with his initial LP record, a best-seller entitled &quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest Comedian in the World, Only Nobody Knows It Yet&quot;, followed by &quot;I Want to Leave You with the Words of a Great Comedian&quot;.

In the &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; interview, he also related how Frank Sinatra and a group of others once came to his show in Las Vegas and Sinatra started heckling his act. Mason made uncomplimentary comments to Sinatra until he &quot;and his whole group&quot; left. When asked whether he thought it was naïve to do that, given Sinatra&#x27;s connections with &quot;the Mob&quot;, Mason said, &quot;No, I said to myself...what could they do me?&quot; He went on to describe how shots were later fired into his room which cracked all the windows. The police did not pursue an investigation.

===&quot;Middle finger&quot; incident (1964)===
During his October 18, 1964 appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, Mason allegedly gave host Ed Sullivan the finger on air. Footage of the incident shows Mason in the middle of doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, who had placed himself directly behind the camera, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by holding up two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, and to cut his act short, as the program was about to cut away due to having been partly pre-empted by an impromptu speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson that the show carried.

Mason began working his own fingers into his act to make fun of the situation and pointed toward Sullivan with an index finger, a thumb, but not, as Sullivan mistakenly believed, his middle finger. Sullivan was infuriated by this, and banned Mason from future appearances on the show, canceling Mason&#x27;s six-appearance contract worth $45,000 (). Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger; he later said that he had not heard of the middle finger gesture at that time.

To clear his name, Mason filed a libel suit on the grounds that Sullivan had defamed him at the New York Supreme Court. That court dismissed most of Mason&#x27;s complaint. Both Mason and Sullivan appealed to the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division (which reinstated three additional causes of action against Sullivan) in June 1966.

Mason was nevertheless banned from the show for a period of time. Sullivan asserted that Mason was unpredictable and could not be trusted. Because of Sullivan&#x27;s influence, he was branded as unreliable, volatile, and obscene, and he failed to get substantial television work for the next two decades. 

Mason was given a single comeback appearance on Sullivan&#x27;s television program two years later, and Sullivan publicly apologized to him, but the damage was done. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, &quot;It is a great thrill ... and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again.&quot; Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; February 25, 1968; November 24, 1968; July 22, 1969; and August 31, 1969. Mason later said: &quot;It took twenty years to overcome what happened in one minute&quot;.

===1965–1985===

In 1969, Mason made his Broadway theater debut as Jewish widower Nat Weiss in the comedy play &quot;A Teaspoon Every Four Hours&quot;, which he wrote with Mike Mortman. It held the Broadway record of 97 previews and closed after its official opening performance (a preview record succeeded by &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot; with its 182 previews prior to opening). He also appeared in the films &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979) and &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981).

===1986–2011===
In 1986, Mason made a triumphant return to Broadway in the two-year run of &quot;The World According to Me!&quot; which ran for 367 performances in its first run and 203 performances in its second run at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, his first of several one-man theatrical shows. It was well received both by critics and the public; Frank Rich, the sometimes harsh reviewer of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;So sue me ... Mason was very, very funny&quot;. It won a Special Tony Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, an Ace Award, an Emmy Award, and a Grammy nomination. His special &quot;Jackie Mason on Broadway&quot; won an Emmy Award for outstanding writing and an Ace Award.

Mason starred in the movie &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; (1988), where his character had the same surname, Hartounian, as his character in &quot;The Jerk&quot;. In 1990 and 1991, Mason again was on Broadway, this time with his successful two-act show &quot;Brand New&quot;, which ran for 216 performances at the Neil Simon Theatre, and won him his second Outer Critics Circle Award. Critic Clive Barnes of the &quot;New York Post&quot; praised the &quot;brilliant&quot; comic and his &quot;totally new from top to &quot;tuchis&quot;&quot; humor. Critic Mel Gussow of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked on the &quot;exact meeting&quot; between performance and material in which Mason engaged in a comic attack on everyone, including himself, cutting them all down to size.

In 1992, Mason won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his voice-over of Rabbi Hyman Krustofski in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot;, making him the first guest star to win an Emmy for his role. Mason also appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes &quot;Today I Am a Clown&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Springfield&quot;, &quot;The Ten-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, &quot;At Long Last Leave&quot;, and &quot;Clown in the Dumps&quot;; the last episode focuses upon Rabbi Krustofski&#x27;s death and its effects on his son, Krusty the Clown. The character would appear three more times in fantasy sequences/flashbacks in &quot;The Nightmare After Krustmas&quot;, &quot;Flanders&#x27; Ladder&quot; and &quot;Woo-Hoo Dunnit?&quot; which was his final appearance in the series and final acting performance before his death in 2021.
One of his Broadway shows, his two-act &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; (1994–95) ran for 347 performances at Broadway&#x27;s John Golden Theater. Critic John Simon of &quot;Time&quot; wrote: &quot;His method is hyperbole and &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;, but always informed by bitter reason. His irony is a spotlight illuminating our absurdities; his zingers are scalpels laying bare the sickness under the skin. There is a unifying thrust, a focus, a structure: an attack on both liberal hypocrisy and conservative apathy, and on the climate of political correctness that makes it impossible to attack anyone but WASPs. ... Mason is a true satirist in the mold of ... Mark Twain . ... &quot; It was performed during the same period that Bill Maher&#x27;s late-night, half-hour political TV talk show &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; was on the air. Maher brought a lawsuit against Mason&#x27;s production, which was dismissed as frivolous. Mason was able to use this show title, and it is one of his most successful road productions. Between these shows, Mason played the lead in a short-lived television interfaith sitcom called &quot;Chicken Soup&quot; alongside Lynn Redgrave.

Mason also put on the Broadway one-man shows &quot;Love thy Neighbor&quot; (1996–97) which ran for 225 performances at the Booth Theatre (critic Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Mason&#x27;s routines as &quot;roaringly funny&quot;), &quot;Much Ado About Everything&quot; (1999–2000) which was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment for its run in London) and ran for 183 performances at the John Golden Theatre (in this effort Van Gelder described Mason as &quot;convulsing audiences&quot;), &quot;Prune Danish&quot; (2002; nominated for a Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event), &quot;Jackie Mason: Freshly Squeezed&quot; (2005; for which he was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance), and &quot;The Ultimate Jew&quot; (2008).

In a 2005 poll to find the Comedian&#x27;s Comedian, Mason was voted #43 among the top-50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. He was also ranked #63 in &quot;Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time&quot;. He holds the record for the longest-running one-man show in Broadway history and the longest-running stand-up show in the history of London&#x27;s West End.

His full-length courtroom dramedy motion picture &quot;One Angry Man&quot; was released in 2010 throughout the US and Canada. Mason&#x27;s most recent film &quot;Jackie Goldberg: Private Dick&quot; (2011) was a direct-to-DVD production, released by FilmWorks Entertainment.

==Political views==
Originally a Democrat, Mason registered as a Republican in 2007. He spoke out in defense of Donald Trump.

Mason was an admirer of Rabbi Meir Kahane. He openly endorsed Kahane&#x27;s plan to pay Israeli Arabs unwilling to accept Israeli sovereignty to emigrate. He also served as the honored speaker at a fundraising event for a yeshiva founded by Kahane.

In an issue of the newspaper &quot;The Evening Star&quot; dated March 1, 1971, Jackie Mason was quoted as saying &quot;Democratic principles shouldn&#x27;t apply to Israel like they do to America&quot;.

In January 2001, Mason co-founded the organization One Jerusalem in response to the Oslo peace agreement. Its stated cause is &quot;Maintaining a united Jerusalem as the un-divided capital of Israel.&quot;

==Controversies==
In 1991, Mason was criticized by African-American organizations including the NAACP, when he called New York City mayor David Dinkins &quot;a fancy &quot;shvartze&quot; with a moustache&quot;; Mason later apologized. In 2009, Mason referred to Barack Obama as a &quot;shvartze&quot; during one of his stand-up routines, which prompted members of the audience to walk out.

In 2003, Mason co-wrote an article that advised Israeli leaders to threaten the expulsion of Palestinians from Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip. Mason and Raoul Felder wrote, &quot;We have paralyzed ourselves by our sickening fear of World Opinion, which is why we find it impossible to face one simple fact: We will never win this war unless we immediately threaten to drive every Arab out of Israel if the killing doesn&#x27;t stop.&quot;

On 2006, Mason filed a lawsuit against the group Jews for Jesus for using his likeness in a pamphlet. His image was used next to the tagline &quot;Jackie Mason ... a Jew for Jesus!?&quot; Mason said in court papers filed in New York: &quot;While I have the utmost respect for people who practice the Christian faith, the fact is, as everyone knows, I am as Jewish as a Matzah ball or kosher salami.&quot; Mason asserted that the group was using his image and fame to gain attention and converts. The group responded to the suit by saying, &quot;Shame on him for getting so upset about this.&quot; The lawsuit was settled in 2006, with Jews for Jesus apologizing.

In 2012, Mason said that a friend at the time, Kaoru Suzuki-McMullen, attacked him while leaving his apartment on West 57th Street in Manhattan. Suzuki-McMullen said she was attacked by Mason, but she was arrested. Both sides agreed to drop the matter and all charges were dropped against Suzuki-McMullen.

==Personal life==

Mason&#x27;s daughter, Sheba Mason, was born in 1985 during Mason&#x27;s decade-long relationship with Ginger Reiter, an English teacher from South Florida. She is also a comedian.

In 1991, Mason married his 37-year-old manager Jyll Rosenfeld.

==Death==
Mason died on July 24, 2021, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after being hospitalized for over two weeks.

Many celebrities and other notable figures mourned Mason&#x27;s death. Gilbert Gottfried called him &quot;one of the best.&quot; Fox News personality Sean Hannity remarked that he was &quot;irreverent, iconoclastic, funny, smart and a great American patriot.&quot; Actor Henry Winkler tweeted that Mason put on &quot;truly one of the funniest shows I have ever seen .. ever .. thank you Jackie and now you get to make heaven laugh.&quot;

<text>The Rt. Rev. William Bedell, D.D. (; 22 September 15717 February 1642), was an English Anglican bishop who served as the 5th Provost of Trinity College Dublin from 1627 to 1629. He also served as Lord Bishop of Kilmore and as a member of the Irish House of Commons from January 1628 to July 1628. 

==Early life and education==
He was born at Black Notley in Essex, England, the son of John Bedell, yeoman. He was admitted pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1584, where he was a pupil of William Perkins: he took B.A. in 1588/89 and M.A. in 1592, being elected a Fellow of Emmanuel College in 1593. He was ordained priest on 10 January 1596/97, by Bishop John Sterne, suffragan bishop of Colchester, and was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1599. He served as vicar of St Mary, Bury St Edmunds, from 1601 to 1607.

==Career==
===Anglican priest===
In 1607, he was appointed chaplain to Sir Henry Wotton, then English Ambassador to Venice, where he remained for three years, acquiring a great reputation as a scholar and theologian. He translated the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; into Italian, and both corresponded and was on terms of close friendship with the Venetian Republican statesman and political theorist Paolo Sarpi. Bedell wrote a series of Protestant sermons with Fulgenzio Micanzio, Sarpi&#x27;s disciple.

Having returned to Bury in 1610, he married Leah, daughter of John Bowles, Esq., of Earsham, Norfolk, and widow of the Recorder of Bury St Edmunds, Robert Maw (died 1609), by whom she had already four children (two of whom survived to be raised by their stepfather). Bedell had by her three sons, William, John, and Ambrose, and a daughter Grace. In 1616, he was appointed to the nearby rectory of Horningsheath by Sir Thomas Jermyn of Rushbrooke Hall (son of Sir Robert Jermyn, benefactor of Emmanuel College). This benefice he held for twelve years.

===Provost of Trinity College, Dublin===
In 1627, he became Provost of Trinity College Dublin, despite having no prior connection with Ireland. The Provostship paid roughly the same as his Horningsheath rectory and he clung to his living in Suffolk until forced to surrender it on grounds of benefice. Owing to his wish to advance the Irish Reformation, Bedell decreed a chapter of the Irish-language New Testament to be read aloud during dinner by a native Irish speaker and for Irish-language prayers to be offered in his chapel.

===Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh===
In 1629, he was appointed to become Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh. He set himself to reform the abuses of his diocese, encouraged the use of the Irish language by the clergy, and personally undertook many of the duties generally discharged by the bishop&#x27;s lay chancellor. He is noted for commissioning the translation of the Bible into the Irish Language, which was undertaken by the Protestant Rector of Templeport parish, The Rev. Muircheartach Ó Cionga. He also chose to appoint only Irish speakers to parishes.

In 1633, he resigned the see of Ardagh, retaining the more primitive bishopric of Kilmore, where he encountered opposition from Anglicans and Catholics alike for his practice of reaching out to and trying to evangelist the native Irish. He was also determined to repair the neglected church buildings throughout the diocese, where, in 1638, he held a synod of all the Anglican clergy and officers within the diocese to discuss lax discipline. He was asked by the court of the Plantation Commission to &quot;lay out&quot; the town of Virginia in the south of County Cavan, after complaints from the Anglican residents there about local Anglo-Irish landlords&#x27; failure to build the town or provide a church for Anglican worship.

Bedell was a man of simple life, often walking miles on foot or travelling on horseback, travelling the dangerous byways. Bedell provided assistance to native Irish converts to Anglicanism and enable them to study for the ministry.

Bedell sided with the Catholics of Kilmore against the excess of Alan Cooke, the incumbent chancellor of the diocese. However, the church courts found that Cooke had legally acquired the right to become chancellor, and the Bishop was unable to remove him.

==Death==
Upon the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the local Irish clans, led by the Chief of Clan O&#x27;Reilly, rose and took over control of the region. The O&#x27;Reillys, however, &quot;gave comfortable words to the Bishop&quot; and William Bedell&#x27;s house at Kilmore in County Cavan was left untouched, became a refuge for those fleeing arrest by the clan. In the end, however, the O&#x27;Reillys demanded upon the dismissal of all who had taken shelter in his house, and on the bishop&#x27;s refusal he was arrested and detained with some others on the nearby island castle of Lough Oughter, Cloughoughter Castle.

He was detained for several weeks and was released after signing a deposition and a remonstrance from his captors, &quot;pleading on their behalf for graces from King Charles.&quot; William Bedell was taken into the care of his friend Denis Sheridan but the sufferings of the Bishop&#x27;s imprisonment had inflicted considerable damage. Shortly after his release Bedell died from his wounds and from exposure on 7 February 1642.

Bishop Bedell was granted the dignity by Clan O&#x27;Reilly of burial next to his wife Leah at Kilmore, where he received an honourable funeral in the presence of the Clan O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s leaders.

Bishop Bedell&#x27;s earliest biography was written by Bishop Gilbert Burnet in 1685 and by his elder son (ed. T. W. Jones, for the Camden Society, 1872). Bedell&#x27;s Last Will and Testament is available through the UK National Archives.

<doc id="308137" wikidata="Q4828920" url="?curid=308137" title="Avionics software">
<text>Avionics software is embedded software with legally mandated safety and reliability concerns used in avionics. The main difference between avionic software and conventional embedded software is that the development process is &quot;required by law&quot; and is &quot;optimized for safety.&quot; 
It is claimed that the process described below is only slightly slower and more costly (perhaps 15 percent) than the normal &quot;ad hoc&quot; processes used for commercial software. Since most software fails because of mistakes, eliminating the mistakes at the earliest possible step is also a relatively inexpensive and reliable way to produce software. In some projects however, mistakes in the specifications may not be detected until deployment. At that point, they can be very expensive to fix.

The basic idea of any software development model is that each step of the design process has outputs called &quot;deliverables.&quot; If the deliverables are tested for correctness and fixed, then normal human mistakes can not easily grow into dangerous or expensive problems. Most manufacturers follow the waterfall model to coordinate the design product, but almost all explicitly permit earlier work to be revised. The result is more often closer to a spiral model.

For an overview of embedded software see embedded system and software development models. The rest of this article assumes familiarity with that information, and discusses differences between commercial embedded systems and commercial development models.

==General overview==
Since most avionics manufacturers see software as a way to add value without adding weight, the importance of embedded software in avionic systems is increasing.

Most modern commercial aircraft with auto-pilots use flight computers and so called flight management systems (FMS) that can fly the aircraft without the pilot&#x27;s active intervention during certain phases of flight. Also under development or in production are unmanned vehicles: missiles and drones which can take off, cruise and land without airborne pilot intervention.

In many of these systems, failure is unacceptable. The reliability of the software running in airborne vehicles (civil or military) is shown by the fact that most airborne accidents occur due to manual errors. Unfortunately reliable software is not necessarily easy to use or intuitive, poor user interface design has been a contributing cause of many aerospace accidents and deaths.

==Regulatory issues==
Due to safety requirements, most nations regulate avionics, or at least adopt standards in use by a group of allies or a customs union. The three regulatory organizations that most affect international aviation development are the U.S, the E.U. and Russia.

In the U.S., avionic and other aircraft components have safety and reliability standards mandated by the Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 25 for Transport Airplanes, Part 23 for Small Airplanes, and Parts 27 and 29 for Rotorcraft. These standards are enforced by &quot;designated engineering representatives&quot; of the FAA who are usually paid by a manufacturer and certified by the FAA.

In the European Union the IEC describes &quot;recommended&quot; requirements for safety-critical systems, which are usually adopted without change by governments. A safe, reliable piece of avionics has a &quot;CE Mark.&quot; The regulatory arrangement is remarkably similar to fire safety in the U.S. and Canada. The government certifies testing laboratories, and the laboratories certify both manufactured items and organizations. Essentially, the oversight of the engineering is outsourced from the government and manufacturer to the testing laboratory.

To assure safety and reliability, national regulatory authorities (e.g. the FAA, CAA, or DOD) require software development standards. Some representative standards include MIL-STD-2167 for military systems, or RTCA DO-178B and its successor DO-178C for civil aircraft.

The regulatory requirements for this software can be expensive compared to other software, but they are usually the minimum that is required to produce the necessary safety.

==Development process==
The main difference between avionics software and other embedded systems is that the actual standards are often far more detailed and rigorous than commercial standards, usually described by documents with hundreds of pages. It is usually run on a real time operating system.

Since the process is legally required, most processes have documents or software to trace requirements from numbered paragraphs in the specifications and designs to exact pieces of code, with exact tests for each, and a box on the final certification checklist. This is specifically to prove conformance to the legally mandated standard.

Deviations from a specific project to the processes described here can occur due to usage of alternative methods or low safety level requirements.

Almost all software development standards describe how to perform and improve specifications, designs, coding, and testing (See software development model). However avionics software development standards add some steps to the development for safety and certification:

===Human interfaces===
Projects with substantial human interfaces are usually prototyped or simulated. The videotape is usually retained, but the prototype retired immediately after testing, because otherwise senior management and customers can believe the system is complete. A major goal is to find human-interface issues that can affect safety and usability.

===Hazard analysis===
Safety-critical avionics usually have a hazard analysis. The early stages of the project, already have at least a vague idea of the main parts of the project. An engineer then takes each block of a block diagram and considers the things that could go wrong with that block, and how they affect the system as a whole. Subsequently, the severity and probability of the hazards are estimated. The problems then become requirements that feed into the design&#x27;s specifications.

Projects involving military cryptographic security usually include a security analysis, using methods very like the hazard analysis.

===Maintenance manual===
As soon as the engineering specification is complete, writing the maintenance manual can start. A maintenance manual is essential to repairs, and of course, if the system can&#x27;t be fixed, it will not be safe.

There are several levels to most standards. A low-safety product such as an in-flight entertainment unit (a flying TV) may escape with a schematic and procedures for installation and adjustment. A navigation system, autopilot or engine may have thousands of pages of procedures, inspections and rigging instructions. Documents are now (2003) routinely delivered on CD-ROM, in standard formats that include text and pictures.

One of the odder documentation requirements is that most commercial contracts require an assurance that system documentation will be available indefinitely. The normal commercial method of providing this assurance is to form and fund a small foundation or trust. The trust then maintains a mailbox and deposits copies (usually in ultrafiche) in a secure location, such as rented space in a university&#x27;s library (managed as a special collection), or (more rarely now) buried in a cave or a desert location.

===Design and specification documents===
These are usually much like those in other software development models. A crucial difference is that requirements are usually traced as described above. In large projects, requirements-traceability is such a large expensive task that it requires large, expensive computer programs to manage it.

===Code production and review===
The code is written, then usually reviewed by a programmer (or group of programmers, usually independently) that did not write it originally (another legal requirement). Special organizations also usually conduct code reviews with a checklist of possible mistakes. When a new type of mistake is found it is added to the checklist, and fixed throughout the code.

The code is also often examined by special programs that analyze correctness (Static code analysis), such as SPARK examiner for the SPARK (a subset of the Ada programming language) or lint for the C-family of programming languages (primarily C, though).
The compilers or special checking programs like &quot;lint&quot; check to see if types of data are compatible with the operations on them, also such tools are regularly used to enforce strict usage of valid programming language subsets and programming styles.
Another set of programs measure software metrics, to look for parts of the code that are likely to have mistakes.
All the problems are fixed, or at least understood and double-checked.

Some code, such as digital filters, graphical user interfaces and inertial navigation systems, are so well understood that software tools have been developed to write the software. In these cases, specifications are developed and reliable software is produced automatically.

===Unit testing===
&quot;Unit test&quot; code is written to exercise every instruction of the code at least once to get 100% code coverage. A &quot;coverage&quot; tool is often used to verify that every instruction is executed, and then the test coverage is documented as well, for legal reasons.

This test is among the most powerful. It forces detailed review of the program logic, and detects most coding, compiler and some design errors. Some organizations write the unit tests &quot;before&quot; writing the code, using the software design as a module specification. The unit test code is executed, and all the problems are fixed.

===Integration testing===
As pieces of code become available, they are added to a skeleton of code, and tested in place to make sure each interface works. Usually the built-in-tests of the electronics should be finished first, to begin burn-in and radio emissions tests of the electronics.

Next, the most valuable features of the software are integrated. It is very convenient for the integrators to have a way to run small selected pieces of code, perhaps from a simple menu system.

Some program managers try to arrange this integration process so that after some minimal level of function is achieved, the system becomes deliverable at any following date, with increasing numbers of features as time passes.

===Black box and acceptance testing===
Meanwhile, the test engineers usually begin assembling a test rig, and releasing preliminary tests for use by the software engineers. At some point, the tests cover all of the functions of the engineering specification. At this point, testing of the entire avionic unit begins. The object of the acceptance testing is to prove that the unit is safe and reliable in operation.

The first test of the software, and one of the most difficult to meet in a tight schedule, is a realistic test of the unit&#x27;s radio emissions. This usually must be started early in the project to assure that there is time to make any necessary changes to the design of the electronics.
The software is also subjected to a structural coverage analysis, where tests are run and code coverage is collected and analyzed.

===Certification===
Each step produces a deliverable, either a document, code, or a test report. When the software passes all of its tests (or enough to be sold safely), these are bound into a certification report, that can literally have thousands of pages. The designated engineering representative, who has been striving for completion, then decides if the result is acceptable. If it is, he signs it, and the avionic software is certified.

<doc id="308142" wikidata="Q594275" url="?curid=308142" title="General Santos">
<text>General Santos, officially the City of General Santos and abbreviated as GenSan, is a highly urbanized city in the region of Soccsksargen, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 697,315 people making it the most populous city in Soccsksargen Region.

It is located on the island of Mindanao, it is the southernmost and 15th-most populous city in the Philippines. It is the regional center for commerce and industry of the Soccsksargen region, and it is also the only coastal as well as the largest city in the province of South Cotabato wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the Philippine Statistics Authority but administered independently of it.

== Etymology ==
The city was named after Gen. Paulino Santos, a former Commanding General of the Philippine Army and the settlement&#x27;s leading pioneer.

==History==
The nomadic B&#x27;laan people are the original inhabitants of present-day General Santos, and traces of their early settlements of the area are found in the city&#x27;s place names, which are derived from their vocabulary. Their name for the city, &quot;Dadiangas&quot;, is from the &quot;Ziziphus spina-christi&quot; tree that was once abundant in the area and is now a protected species under Republic Act 8371 or the Indigenous Peoples Right Act of 2007. The B&#x27;laan now lives alongside the city&#x27;s new generation of settlers and other immigrants.

Beforehand, the B&#x27;laan would were forced upland into the surrounding hills after the Muslims settle in the area under the rule of the Sultanate of Maguindanao.

After the fall of Maguindanao, Datu Uto of Buayan expanded his domain south towards Sarangani Bay. Dadiangas remained as a port under the Sultanate of Buayan until the Spanish conquered the Sarangani Bay area by the end of the 19th century.

===Spanish and American colonial period===
In 1898, by the end of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines, two brothers hailing from Barcelona, Spain, Jose and Alberto Olarte, settled in Makar, now known as Brgy. Labangal. In October 29, 1903, the Municipality of Makar was officially established under the American Insular Government Act No. 21 Section 4. Nearly eleven years later in July 23, 1914, the Municipal District of Buayan situated in what is now Brgy. Buayan was established. Makar formed what would later become the western part of General Santos, while Buayan consisted its eastern part.

In 1924, the Provincial Board Resolution No. 8 proposed by the provincial government of Cotabato declared the creation of a settlement with an area of 300 hectares which will serve as the market settlement for agricultural products coming from Allah Valley and areas situated south of Lake Buluan. Makar was included in the proposed 300-hectare townsite area which was divided into three areas. The proposal was submitted to Governor-General Henry L. Stimson in 1928. However, for reasons unknown, only one area was approved for the said proposed market town, which happened to be an area which is a flat plain dotted by evergreen trees now eponymously known as Dadiangas, which would instead serve as the nucleus of General Santos as a city for the years to come.

===Commonwealth period===

Organized under the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) of the Commonwealth Government headed by President Manuel L. Quezon, General Paulino Santos led the relocation of 62 Christian settlers from Luzon to the shores of Sarangani Bay aboard the steam ship “Basilan” of the &quot;Compañía Marítima&quot; on February 27, 1939. The 62 pioneers, mostly agricultural and trade graduates, were the first large batch of settlers to land in the area with the mission to industriously cultivate the region. After this first influx of pioneers, more Christians from Visayas and Luzon subsequently migrated into the area, gradually driving some of the B&#x27;laan residents to the hills and mountains, where they have lost their livelihood and somewhat displaced Maguindanaon living in the area.

In March 1939, the first formal settlement in the city was established in Alagao, which is now known as Barangay Lagao. Lagao was known then as the &quot;Municipal District of Buayan&quot; under the jurisdiction of the deputy governor of the Municipal District of Glan, until it officially became an independent Municipal District of Buayan on October 1, 1940, appointing Datu Sharif Zainal Abedin, an Arab &quot;mestizo&quot; married to a daughter of a very influential &quot;datu&quot; of lower Buayan, as the first district municipal mayor.

===Second World War===
During World War II, the Municipal District of Buayan become one of the last frontiers between the combined American and Filipino forces and troops from the Empire of Japan. Retreating Imperial Japanese forces made Klaja Karsts Land their last ground for defence, constructing round cement bunkers and tunnels. These bunkers can still be seen at Sitio Guadalupe; most of the tunnels, however, have since been damaged and even destroyed by treasure hunters and land developers.

===Renaming and elevation to city status===
A year after the Philippines regained full sovereignty from the United States on July 4, 1946, the Municipality of Buayan became a 4th class regular municipality by virtue of the Executive Order Number 82, dated August 18, 1947, by President Manuel Roxas, absorbing the Municipality of Makar and the Municipal District of Glan, whose low income bracket at the time disqualified it for the honour. Dadiangas was the seat of government for the Municipality of Buayan electing Irineo Santiago as its first Municipal Mayor on a local election that was held on November 11, 1947. Mayor Santiago was formally inducted on January 1, 1948.

Six years later, in June 1954, the Municipality of Buayan was renamed General Santos as a tribute to the leading pioneer via Act No. 1107 authored by Congressman Luminog Mangelen of Cotabato Province.

From 1963 to 1967, the municipality&#x27;s economy experienced a boom under Mayor Lucio A. Velayo, as several large agri-based and multinational firms such as Dole Philippines, General Milling Corporation and UDAGRI expanded into the area. Although it was then qualified to become a fourth class city from being a municipality, the residents rejected a move by Congressman Salipada Pendatun to convert the Municipality of Buayan into a city and to rename it ’’Rajah Buayan’’.

On July 8, 1968, the Municipality of General Santos was converted into a city upon the approval of Republic Act No. 5412, authored by Congressman James L. Chiongbian. By this time, General Santos City had already established itself as a major economic and educational hub in the region. Three of the oldest educational institutions in the city — Notre Dame Dadiangas University (1948), Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Colleges (1957), and Mindanao State University (1961) — were established prior to the city’s official founding. It was inaugurated on September 5 of that year, with Antonio C. Acharon became the new city&#x27;s first mayor. On September 5, 1988, a decade after its inauguration as a chartered city, GenSan was declared a highly urbanized city of South Cotabato.

Even after becoming a highly urbanized city independent from South Cotabato in 1988, General Santos remained part of the province&#x27;s congressional representation. The city only gained a separate representative with the passage of Republic Act No. 11243 on March 11, 2019, which segregated General Santos from the first congressional district of South Cotabato to be its 3rd congressional district. On September 15, 2021, House Bill No. 10021 authored by Representative Ferdinand Hernandez, that officially mandate General Santos as a lone district, separate from South Cotabato was passed on third and final reading.

In April 2001, Mayor Adelbert W. Antonino, an ally of deposed president Joseph Estrada, coordinated with various mayors and governors to bring their respective constituents to Epifanio delos Santos Avenue in Metro Manila to protest the arrest of Estrada.

<text>The Sanctuary of Imām &#x27;Alī (), also known as the Mosque of &#x27;Alī (), located in Najaf, Iraq, is a mausoleum which Shia and Sunni Muslims believe contains the tomb of &#x27;Alī ibn Abī Tālib, a cousin, son-in-law and companion of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. The Shī&#x27;as consider &#x27;Alī as their first Imām and the first of the twelve caliphs of Muhammad, and the Sunnis regard him as the fourth Sunni Rashid Caliph. According to Shī&#x27;ite belief, buried next to &#x27;Alī within this mosque are the remains of Adam and Nuh (Noah). Each year, millions of pilgrims visit the Shrine and pay tribute to Imām &#x27;Alī.

The shrine monument has been built and rebuilt numerous times throughout history; the current shrine dates back to the mid-Safavid period. Its construction began in 1621 under the orders of Shah Abbas the Great and was completed in 1631 after his death. Baha&#x27; al-din al-&#x27;Amili was appointed as the architect and the structure was designed in the classical Safavid Persian style. Over time the shrine has undergone various notable renovations aimed to enhance its beauty and grandeur, most notably the gilding of the dome and minarets of the shrine in 1743 by Nader Shah Afshar.

==History==

The Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid built the first structure over the tomb of Imām &#x27;Alī in 786, which included a green dome.

The Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil flooded the site in 850, but in the 10th century Abu&#x27;l-Hayja, the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, rebuilt the shrine in 923, which included a large dome.

In 979–980, the Shi&#x27;ite Buyid emir &#x27;Adud al-Dawla expanded the shrine, which included a cenotaph over the burial site and a new dome. This included hanging textiles and carpets. He also protected Najaf with a wall and citadel, while providing water from the Euphrates via a qanat.

The Seljuq sultan Malik-Shah I contributed large gifts to the shrine in 1086, as did Caliph Al-Nasir.

The vizier Shams al-Din Juvayni added facilities to serve the pilgrims in 1267, and the sultan Ghazan Khan added the Dar al-Siyada wing for the sayyids in 1303.

Ibn Battuta visited the shrine in 1326, noting that it was &quot;carpeted with various sorts of carpets of silk and other materials, and contains candelabra of gold and silver, large and small.&quot; Between the three tombs, &quot;are dishes of gold and silver, containing rose-water, musk and various kinds of perfumes. The visitor dips his hand in this and anoints his face with it for a blessing.&quot; A fire destroyed the shrine in 1354, but it was rebuilt around 1358 by the Jalairid sultan Shaikh Awais Jalayir. He also interred his father&#x27;s remains, Hasan Buzurg in the courtyard. Timur ordered the restoration of the shrine after a visit to Najaf. Suleiman the Magnificent also offered gifts, which probably helped restore the shrine, after a visit in 1534. The Safavid Shah Ismail I visited in 1508, but it was Abbas I who visited Najaf twice and commissioned 500 men to rebuild the shrine in 1623. The restoration was completed by his grandson Shah Safi al-Din in 1632. This restoration included a new dome, expanded courtyard, a hospital, kitchen, and hospice, so as to accommodate the numerous pilgrims. The cenotaph was restored in 1713 and the dome stabilized in 1716.

In 1742, Nader Shah gilded the dome and minaret, and this was chronicled by Nasrallah al-Haeri in his famous poem, &quot;iḏhā ḍhāmak al-dahra yawman wa jārā&quot; (). Nader Shah&#x27;s wife paid for the walls and courtyard to be rebuilt and the retiling of the iwan faience. In 1745, the iwan was rebuilt as a gilt muqarnas of nine tiers. In 1791, a raised stone floor covered the tombs in the courtyard, creating a cellar space for them.

The first European visitors included Carsten Niebuhr in 1765, William Loftus in 1853, and Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1864. The Ottoman emperor Abdülaziz rebuilt the Clock Portal (Bab al-Sa&#x27;a) and the Portal of Muslim Ibn &#x27;Aqil in 1863 and the former gilded in 1888 by the Qajar sultan Naser al-Din Shah Qajar. In 1886, Sultan Naser al-Din, also repaired the dome because there were breaks in it due to the weather.

===Independent Iraq===
During the uprising of March 1991, following the Persian Gulf War, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Republican Guards damaged the shrine, where members of the Shia opposition were cornered, in storming the shrine and massacring virtually all its occupants. Afterwards, the shrine was closed for two years, officially for repairs. Saddam Hussein also deported to Iran a large number of the residents of the area who were of Iranian descent.

In the three years after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. military, a number of violent incidents occurred at the mosque:
* April 10, 2003: former Saddam Hussein era custodian Haydar Al-Killidar Al-Rufaye and anti-Saddam Shia leader Sayed Abdul Majid al-Khoei, the son of Grand Ayatollah Abu al Qasim al-Khoei, were killed by a mob near the mosque. Al-Khoei had returned from exile in Britain to encourage cooperation with the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq.
* August 29, 2003: the 2003 Imam Ali Shrine bombing. A car bomb exploded outside the mosque just as the main Friday prayers were ending. Somewhere between 85 and 125 people were killed, including the influential Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, the Shia leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. The blast is thought to be the work of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. 
* May 24, 2004: unidentified mortar fire hit the shrine, damaging gates which lead to the tomb of Imam Ali.
* August 5, 2004: Muqtada al-Sadr and the Mahdi Army seized the mosque and used it as a military base for launching attacks against the Iraqi police, the provincial government and coalition forces. The fighting was eventually ended by a peace agreement. Neighbouring buildings suffered considerable damage, but the mosque itself suffered only superficial damage from stray bullets and shrapnel.
* August 10, 2006: a suicide bomber blew himself up near the shrine, killing 40 people and injuring more than 50 others.

==Architecture and decoration==
Numerous structures have existed over the tomb of Imam Ali since its discovery during the rule of Harun al Rashid in the 8th century. The current structure though dates back to the Safavid period in the 17th century and was designed by the famous Safavid polymath Baha&#x27; al-din al-&#x27;Amili. The shrine consists of the central tomb chamber topped by a large double shell onion-shaped dome 42 m (138 ft) in height, and flanked by twin 38 m (125 ft) tall minarets. The inner shell of the dome is visible from the inside of the tomb chamber while the monumental outer shell is visible from the courtyard of the shrine and throughout the city. The inside of the tomb chamber and its surrounding halls are ornamented with an array of mirror mosaics, most of which has been replaced over the years and are not original. The ceramic mosaics that adorn the inner shell of the dome however are original and date back to the original construction of the shrine during the Safavid period. At the front of the shrine stands a large golden iwan flanked by two minarets. The monumental dome, iwan, and minarets are adorned with gold coated copper plates, though they were originally adorned with green and blue ceramic tiles in the typical Safavid fashion. The gilding of the shrines dome and façade elements occurred in 1743 under the orders of the Iranian king Nader Shah Afshar and his wife Razia Begum. The golden iwan, dome, and minarets contains numerous inscriptions in Persian, Arabic, and Azeri Turkish with poems in praise of Ali ibn Abi Talib inscriptions chronicling the gilding of the shrine by Nader Shah. The left and right side walls of the shrine are ornamented with cuerda seca tile panels most of which date from either the 18th or 19th centuries. Imam Ali&#x27;s shrine is among the last of the Shi&#x27;ite shrines in Iraq to retains its nearly full set of original antique tiles.

Around the shrine on its North, East, and Southern sides is a large courtyard surrounded by pointed arch arcades, while the shrine is linked on the West to the Al-Ra&#x27;s Mosque. The courtyard arcades are two floors in height and contain various small chambers historically used as dormitory rooms for seminary students, today most are used as administrative offices. The Al-Ras mosque (literally &quot;The Head Mosque&quot;) is oriented in the direction of the head of Ali Ibn Abi Talib&#x27;s grave. The original Al-Ras mosque is said to have dated from the Ilhanate period in 14th century however it was demolished in 2005 by the shrine&#x27;s administration and rebuilt in a modern style using contemporary construction materials and methods. Local architectural historians and preservationists have argued the destruction of the original Al-Ras mosque destroyed an important part of the shrine&#x27;s architectural heritage and the introduction of modern construction methods and materials has damaged the architectural integrity of the shrine. The original Ilkhanate era mihrab of the Al-Ras mosque underwent restoration in 2023 after having been kept in storage for 18 years and will be put on display in the shrine&#x27;s museum.

Entrance to the shrine is through three main monumental portals on the eastern, northern and southern sides, called the Main or Clock Portal, al-Tusi Portal and the Qibla Portal respectively. There are two additional monumental portals, the Portal of Muslim Ibn &#x27;Aqil, north of the Clock Gate, and the al-&#x27;Amara, or al-Faraj Portal, at the southwestern corner. The most notable of these entry portals is the Clock Portal (Iwan-i-Sa&#x27;at) and is topped by a tall clock tower ornamented with mosaic tiles. The clock mechanism and its bells were produced in Manchester, England and brought to the shrine in 1887, this is visible on iron engravings on the bells.

==Religious status and precincts==
As the burial site of one of Islam&#x27;s most important figure, the shrine of Imām &#x27;Alī is considered by all Shī&#x27;a Muslims as the fourth holiest Islamic site. The Boston Globe reports &quot;for the Muslim Shias, Najaf is the &quot;fourth holiest city&quot;, behind Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Palestine.&quot; It is estimated that only Karbala, Mecca, and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. A &quot;hadith&quot; attributed to Ja&#x27;far as-Sādiq, the Sixth Imami Shī&#x27;ite Imām, mentions the site as one of &quot;five definitive holy places that we respect very much&quot;.

The site is visited annually by at least 8 million pilgrims on average, which is estimated to increase to 20 million in years to come. Many Shī&#x27;ites believe that &#x27;Alī did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently asked his friends and family to bury him secretly. This secret gravesite is supposed to have been revealed later during the Abbasid Caliphate by as-Sādiq. Most Shī&#x27;ites accept that &#x27;Alī is buried in Imām &#x27;Alī Mosque, in what is now the city of Najaf, which grew around the shrine.

As-Sādiq said that Imām &#x27;Alī Mosque is the third of five holiest Islamic sites: Mecca, Medina, Imām &#x27;Alī Mosque in Najaf, Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbalā, and the Shrine of his daughter Fāṭimah in Qom.

<doc id="308152" wikidata="Q11420049" url="?curid=308152" title="Quartic function">
<text>In algebra, a quartic function is a function of the form
:formula_1
where &quot;a&quot; is nonzero,
which is defined by a polynomial of degree four, called a quartic polynomial.

A &quot;quartic equation&quot;, or equation of the fourth degree, is an equation that equates a quartic polynomial to zero, of the form
:formula_2
where .
The derivative of a quartic function is a cubic function.

Sometimes the term biquadratic is used instead of &quot;quartic&quot;, but, usually, biquadratic function refers to a quadratic function of a square (or, equivalently, to the function defined by a quartic polynomial without terms of odd degree), having the form
:formula_3

Since a quartic function is defined by a polynomial of even degree, it has the same infinite limit when the argument goes to positive or negative infinity. If &quot;a&quot; is positive, then the function increases to positive infinity at both ends; and thus the function has a global minimum. Likewise, if &quot;a&quot; is negative, it decreases to negative infinity and has a global maximum. In both cases it may or may not have another local maximum and another local minimum.

The degree four (&quot;quartic&quot; case) is the highest degree such that every polynomial equation can be solved by radicals, according to the Abel–Ruffini theorem.

==History==
Lodovico Ferrari is credited with the discovery of the solution to the quartic in 1540, but since this solution, like all algebraic solutions of the quartic, requires the solution of a cubic to be found, it could not be published immediately. The solution of the quartic was published together with that of the cubic by Ferrari&#x27;s mentor Gerolamo Cardano in the book &quot;Ars Magna&quot;.

The proof that four is the highest degree of a general polynomial for which such solutions can be found was first given in the Abel–Ruffini theorem in 1824, proving that all attempts at solving the higher order polynomials would be futile. The notes left by Évariste Galois prior to dying in a duel in 1832 later led to an elegant complete theory of the roots of polynomials, of which this theorem was one result.

==Applications==
Each coordinate of the intersection points of two conic sections is a solution of a quartic equation. The same is true for the intersection of a line and a torus. It follows that quartic equations often arise in computational geometry and all related fields such as computer graphics, computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing and optics. Here are examples of other geometric problems whose solution involves solving a quartic equation.

In computer-aided manufacturing, the torus is a shape that is commonly associated with the endmill cutter. To calculate its location relative to a triangulated surface, the position of a horizontal torus on the -axis must be found where it is tangent to a fixed line, and this requires the solution of a general quartic equation to be calculated.

A quartic equation arises also in the process of solving the crossed ladders problem, in which the lengths of two crossed ladders, each based against one wall and leaning against another, are given along with the height at which they cross, and the distance between the walls is to be found.

In optics, Alhazen&#x27;s problem is &quot;Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.&quot; This leads to a quartic equation.

Finding the distance of closest approach of two ellipses involves solving a quartic equation.

The eigenvalues of a 4×4 matrix are the roots of a quartic polynomial which is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix.

The characteristic equation of a fourth-order linear difference equation or differential equation is a quartic equation. An example arises in the Timoshenko-Rayleigh theory of beam bending.

Intersections between spheres, cylinders, or other quadrics can be found using quartic equations.

==Inflection points and golden ratio==
Letting and be the distinct inflection points of the graph of a quartic function, and letting be the intersection of the inflection secant line and the quartic, nearer to than to , then divides into the golden section:

:formula_4

Moreover, the area of the region between the secant line and the quartic below the secant line equals the area of the region between the secant line and the quartic above the secant line. One of those regions is disjointed into sub-regions of equal area.

==Solution==
===Nature of the roots===
Given the general quartic equation
:formula_5
with real coefficients and the nature of its roots is mainly determined by the sign of its discriminant 
:formula_6 
This may be refined by considering the signs of four other polynomials:
:formula_7
such that is the second degree coefficient of the associated depressed quartic (see below);
:formula_8
such that is the first degree coefficient of the associated depressed quartic; 
:formula_9
which is 0 if the quartic has a triple root; and
:formula_10
which is 0 if the quartic has two double roots.

The possible cases for the nature of the roots are as follows:

* If then the equation has two distinct real roots and two complex conjugate non-real roots.
* If then either the equation&#x27;s four roots are all real or none is.
** If &lt; 0 and &lt; 0 then all four roots are real and distinct.
** If &gt; 0 or &gt; 0 then there are two pairs of non-real complex conjugate roots.
* If then (and only then) the polynomial has a multiple root. Here are the different cases that can occur:
** If &lt; 0 and &lt; 0 and , there are a real double root and two real simple roots.
** If &gt; 0 or ( &gt; 0 and ( ≠ 0 or ≠ 0)), there are a real double root and two complex conjugate roots.
** If and ≠ 0, there are a triple root and a simple root, all real.
** If = 0, then:
***If &lt; 0, there are two real double roots.
***If &gt; 0 and = 0, there are two complex conjugate double roots.
***If , all four roots are equal to 

There are some cases that do not seem to be covered, but in fact they cannot occur. For example, , = 0 and ≤ 0 is not one of the cases. In fact, if and = 0 then &gt; 0, since formula_11 so this combination is not possible.

===General formula for roots===
The four roots , , , and for the general quartic equation
:formula_12
with ≠ 0 are given in the following formula, which is deduced from the one in the section on Ferrari&#x27;s method by back changing the variables (see ) and using the formulas for the quadratic and cubic equations.
:formula_13

where and are the coefficients of the second and of the first degree respectively in the associated depressed quartic
:formula_14
and where
:formula_15
(if or , see , below)

with
:formula_16
and
:formula_17 where formula_18 is the aforementioned discriminant. For the cube root expression for &quot;Q&quot;, any of the three cube roots in the complex plane can be used, although if one of them is real that is the natural and simplest one to choose. The mathematical expressions of these last four terms are very similar to those of their cubic counterparts.

====Special cases of the formula====
*If formula_19 the value of formula_20 is a non-real complex number. In this case, either all roots are non-real or they are all real. In the latter case, the value of formula_21 is also real, despite being expressed in terms of formula_22 this is casus irreducibilis of the cubic function extended to the present context of the quartic. One may prefer to express it in a purely real way, by using trigonometric functions, as follows:
::formula_23
:where
::formula_24

*If formula_25 and formula_26 the sign of formula_27 has to be chosen to have formula_28 that is one should define formula_29 as formula_30 maintaining the sign of formula_31
*If formula_32 then one must change the choice of the cube root in formula_20 in order to have formula_34 This is always possible except if the quartic may be factored into formula_35 The result is then correct, but misleading because it hides the fact that no cube root is needed in this case. In fact this case may occur only if the numerator of formula_36 is zero, in which case the associated depressed quartic is biquadratic; it may thus be solved by the method described below.
*If formula_37 and formula_26 and thus also formula_39 at least three roots are equal to each other, and the roots are rational functions of the coefficients. The triple root formula_40 is a common root of the quartic and its second derivative formula_41 it is thus also the unique root of the remainder of the Euclidean division of the quartic by its second derivative, which is a linear polynomial. The simple root formula_42 can be deduced from formula_43
*If formula_44 and formula_45 the above expression for the roots is correct but misleading, hiding the fact that the polynomial is reducible and no cube root is needed to represent the roots.

===Simpler cases===
====Reducible quartics====
Consider the general quartic
:formula_46
It is reducible if , where and are non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients (or more generally with coefficients in the same field as the coefficients of ). Such a factorization will take one of two forms:

:formula_47
or

In either case, the roots of are the roots of the factors, which may be computed using the formulas for the roots of a quadratic function or cubic function.

Detecting the existence of such factorizations can be done using the resolvent cubic of. It turns out that:
* if we are working over (that is, if coefficients are restricted to be real numbers) (or, more generally, over some real closed field) then there is always such a factorization;
* if we are working over (that is, if coefficients are restricted to be rational numbers) then there is an algorithm to determine whether or not is reducible and, if it is, how to express it as a product of polynomials of smaller degree.

In fact, several methods of solving quartic equations (Ferrari&#x27;s method, Descartes&#x27; method, and, to a lesser extent, Euler&#x27;s method) are based upon finding such factorizations.

====Biquadratic equation====
If then the function 
:formula_49 
is called a biquadratic function; equating it to zero defines a biquadratic equation, which is easy to solve as follows

Let the auxiliary variable .
Then becomes a quadratic in : . Let and be the roots of . Then the roots of the quartic are
:formula_50

==== Quasi-palindromic equation ====
The polynomial
: formula_51
is almost palindromic, as (it is palindromic if ). The change of variables in produces the quadratic equation . Since , the quartic equation may be solved by applying the quadratic formula twice.

===Solution methods===

====Converting to a depressed quartic====
For solving purposes, it is generally better to convert the quartic into a depressed quartic by the following simple change of variable. All formulas are simpler and some methods work only in this case. The roots of the original quartic are easily recovered from that of the depressed quartic by the reverse change of variable.

Let
:formula_52
be the general quartic equation we want to solve.

Dividing by , provides the equivalent equation , with , , , and .
Substituting for gives, after regrouping the terms, the equation ,
where
:formula_53
However, this induces a division by zero if . This implies , and thus that the depressed equation is bi-quadratic, and may be solved by an easier method (see above). This was not a problem at the time of Ferrari, when one solved only explicitly given equations with numeric coefficients. For a general formula that is always true, one thus needs to choose a root of the cubic equation such that . This is always possible except for the depressed equation .

Now, if is a root of the cubic equation such that , equation (&quot;) becomes
:formula_54

This equation is of the form , which can be rearranged as or . Therefore, equation (&quot;) may be rewritten as
:formula_55

This equation is easily solved by applying to each factor the quadratic formula. Solving them we may write the four roots as
:formula_56
where and denote either or . As the two occurrences of must denote the same sign, this leaves four possibilities, one for each root.

Therefore, the solutions of the original quartic equation are
:formula_57 
A comparison with the general formula above shows that .

====Descartes&#x27; solution====
Descartes introduced in 1637 the method of finding the roots of a quartic polynomial by factoring it into two quadratic ones. Let

:formula_58

By equating coefficients, this results in the following system of equations:

:formula_59

This can be simplified by starting again with the depressed quartic , which can be obtained by substituting for . Since the coefficient of is , we get , and:

:formula_60

One can now eliminate both and by doing the following:
:formula_61

If we set , then solving this equation becomes finding the roots of the resolvent cubic

which is done elsewhere. This resolvent cubic is equivalent to the resolvent cubic given above (equation (1a)), as can be seen by substituting U = 2m.

If is a square root of a non-zero root of this resolvent (such a non-zero root exists except for the quartic , which is trivially factored),

:formula_62

The symmetries in this solution are as follows. There are three roots of the cubic, corresponding to the three ways that a quartic can be factored into two quadratics, and choosing positive or negative values of for the square root of merely exchanges the two quadratics with one another.

The above solution shows that a quartic polynomial with rational coefficients and a zero coefficient on the cubic term is factorable into quadratics with rational coefficients if and only if either the resolvent cubic (&quot;&quot;) has a non-zero root which is the square of a rational, or is the square of rational and ; this can readily be checked using the rational root test.

====Euler&#x27;s solution====
A variant of the previous method is due to Euler. Unlike the previous methods, both of which use &quot;some&quot; root of the resolvent cubic, Euler&#x27;s method uses all of them. Consider a depressed quartic . Observe that, if
* and are the roots of ,
* and are the roots of ,
then
* the roots of are , , , and ,
* .
Therefore, . In other words, is one of the roots of the resolvent cubic (&quot;) and this suggests that the roots of that cubic are equal to , , and . This is indeed true and it follows from Vieta&#x27;s formulas. It also follows from Vieta&#x27;s formulas, together with the fact that we are working with a depressed quartic, that . (Of course, this also follows from the fact that .) Therefore, if , , and are the roots of the resolvent cubic, then the numbers , , , and are such that
:formula_63
It is a consequence of the first two equations that is a square root of and that is the other square root of . For the same reason,
* is a square root of ,
* is the other square root of ,
* is a square root of ,
* is the other square root of .
Therefore, the numbers , , , and are such that
:formula_64
the sign of the square roots will be dealt with below. The only solution of this system is:
:formula_65
Since, in general, there are two choices for each square root, it might look as if this provides choices for the set }, but, in fact, it provides no more than  such choices, because the consequence of replacing one of the square roots by the symmetric one is that the set } becomes the set }.

In order to determine the right sign of the square roots, one simply chooses some square root for each of the numbers , , and and uses them to compute the numbers , , , and from the previous equalities. Then, one computes the number . Since , , and are the roots of (&quot;), it is a consequence of Vieta&#x27;s formulas that their product is equal to and therefore that . But a straightforward computation shows that
If this number is , then the choice of the square roots was a good one (again, by Vieta&#x27;s formulas); otherwise, the roots of the polynomial will be , , , and , which are the numbers obtained if one of the square roots is replaced by the symmetric one (or, what amounts to the same thing, if each of the three square roots is replaced by the symmetric one).

This argument suggests another way of choosing the square roots:
* pick &quot;any&quot; square root of and &quot;any&quot; square root of ;
* &quot;define&quot; as formula_66.
Of course, this will make no sense if or is equal to , but is a root of (&quot;) only when , that is, only when we are dealing with a biquadratic equation, in which case there is a much simpler approach.

====Solving by Lagrange resolvent====
The symmetric group on four elements has the Klein four-group as a normal subgroup. This suggests using a whose roots may be variously described as a discrete Fourier transform or a Hadamard matrix transform of the roots; see Lagrange resolvents for the general method. Denote by , for from  to , the four roots of . If we set

: formula_67

then since the transformation is an involution we may express the roots in terms of the four in exactly the same way. Since we know the value , we only need the values for , and . These are the roots of the polynomial

:formula_68

Substituting the by their values in term of the , this polynomial may be expanded in a polynomial in whose coefficients are symmetric polynomials in the . By the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, these coefficients may be expressed as polynomials in the coefficients of the monic quartic. If, for simplification, we suppose that the quartic is depressed, that is , this results in the polynomial

This polynomial is of degree six, but only of degree three in , and so the corresponding equation is solvable by the method described in the article about cubic function. By substituting the roots in the expression of the in terms of the , we obtain expression for the roots. In fact we obtain, apparently, several expressions, depending on the numbering of the roots of the cubic polynomial and of the signs given to their square roots. All these different expressions may be deduced from one of them by simply changing the numbering of the .

These expressions are unnecessarily complicated, involving the cubic roots of unity, which can be avoided as follows. If is any non-zero root of (&quot;), and if we set

:formula_69

then

:formula_70

We therefore can solve the quartic by solving for and then solving for the roots of the two factors using the quadratic formula.

This gives exactly the same formula for the roots as the one provided by Descartes&#x27; method.

====Solving with algebraic geometry====
There is an alternative solution using algebraic geometry In brief, one interprets the roots as the intersection of two quadratic curves, then finds the three reducible quadratic curves (pairs of lines) that pass through these points (this corresponds to the resolvent cubic, the pairs of lines being the Lagrange resolvents), and then use these linear equations to solve the quadratic.

The four roots of the depressed quartic may also be expressed as the coordinates of the intersections of the two quadratic equations and i.e., using the substitution that two quadratics intersect in four points is an instance of Bézout&#x27;s theorem. Explicitly, the four points are for the four roots of the quartic.

These four points are not collinear because they lie on the irreducible quadratic and thus there is a 1-parameter family of quadratics (a pencil of curves) passing through these points. Writing the projectivization of the two quadratics as quadratic forms in three variables:
:formula_71
the pencil is given by the forms for any point in the projective line — in other words, where and are not both zero, and multiplying a quadratic form by a constant does not change its quadratic curve of zeros.

This pencil contains three reducible quadratics, each corresponding to a pair of lines, each passing through two of the four points, which can be done formula_72 =  different ways. Denote these , , and . Given any two of these, their intersection has exactly the four points.

The reducible quadratics, in turn, may be determined by expressing the quadratic form as a  matrix: reducible quadratics correspond to this matrix being singular, which is equivalent to its determinant being zero, and the determinant is a homogeneous degree three polynomial in and and corresponds to the resolvent cubic.

<text>Vacuum energy is an underlying background energy that exists in space throughout the entire universe. The vacuum energy is a special case of zero-point energy that relates to the quantum vacuum.
The effects of vacuum energy can be experimentally observed in various phenomena such as spontaneous emission, the Casimir effect, and the Lamb shift, and are thought to influence the behavior of the Universe on cosmological scales. Using the upper limit of the cosmological constant, the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be 10−9 joules (10−2 ergs), or ~5 GeV per cubic meter. However, in quantum electrodynamics, consistency with the principle of Lorentz covariance and with the magnitude of the Planck constant suggests a much larger value of 10113 joules per cubic meter. This huge discrepancy is known as the cosmological constant problem or, colloquially, the &quot;vacuum catastrophe.&quot;

==Origin==
Quantum field theory states that all fundamental fields, such as the electromagnetic field, must be quantized at every point in space. A field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field is like the displacement of a ball from its rest position. The theory requires &quot;vibrations&quot; in, or more accurately changes in the strength of, such a field to propagate as per the appropriate wave equation for the particular field in question. The second quantization of quantum field theory requires that each such ball–spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. Canonically, if the field at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator, its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the elementary particles of particle physics. Thus, according to the theory, even the vacuum has a vastly complex structure and all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The theory considers vacuum to implicitly have the same properties as a particle, such as spin or polarization in the case of light, energy, and so on. According to the theory, most of these properties cancel out on average leaving the vacuum empty in the literal sense of the word. One important exception, however, is the vacuum energy or the vacuum expectation value of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator requires the lowest possible energy, or zero-point energy of such an oscillator to be

formula_1

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. To remove this infinity, one may argue that only differences in energy are physically measurable, much as the concept of potential energy has been treated in classical mechanics for centuries. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of renormalization. In all practical calculations, this is how the infinity is handled.

Vacuum energy can also be thought of in terms of virtual particles (also known as vacuum fluctuations) which are created and destroyed out of the vacuum. These particles are always created out of the vacuum in particle–antiparticle pairs, which in most cases shortly annihilate each other and disappear. However, these particles and antiparticles may interact with others before disappearing, a process which can be mapped using Feynman diagrams. Note that this method of computing vacuum energy is mathematically equivalent to having a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point and, therefore, suffers the same renormalization problems.

Additional contributions to the vacuum energy come from spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory.

==Implications==

Vacuum energy has a number of consequences. In 1948, Dutch physicists Hendrik B. G. Casimir and Dirk Polder predicted the existence of a tiny attractive force between closely placed metal plates due to resonances in the vacuum energy in the space between them. This is now known as the Casimir effect and has since been extensively experimentally verified. It is therefore believed that the vacuum energy is &quot;real&quot; in the same sense that more familiar conceptual objects such as electrons, magnetic fields, etc., are real. However, alternative explanations for the Casimir effect have since been proposed.

Other predictions are harder to verify. Vacuum fluctuations are always created as particle–antiparticle pairs. The creation of these virtual particles near the event horizon of a black hole has been hypothesized by physicist Stephen Hawking to be a mechanism for the eventual &quot;evaporation&quot; of black holes. If one of the pair is pulled into the black hole before this, then the other particle becomes &quot;real&quot; and energy/mass is essentially radiated into space from the black hole. This loss is cumulative and could result in the black hole&#x27;s disappearance over time. The time required is dependent on the mass of the black hole (the equations indicate that the smaller the black hole, the more rapidly it evaporates) but could be on the order of 1060 years for large solar-mass black holes.

The vacuum energy also has important consequences for physical cosmology. General relativity predicts that energy is equivalent to mass, and therefore, if the vacuum energy is &quot;really there&quot;, it should exert a gravitational force. Essentially, a non-zero vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the cosmological constant, which affects the expansion of the universe.

== Field strength of vacuum energy ==
The field strength of vacuum energy is a concept proposed in a theoretical study that explores the nature of the vacuum and its relationship to gravitational interactions. The study derived a mathematical framework that uses the field strength of vacuum energy as an indicator of the bulk (spacetime) resistance to localized curvature. It illustrates the association of the field strength of vacuum energy to the curvature of the background, where this concept challenges the traditional understanding of gravity and suggests that the gravitational constant, G, may not be a universal constant, but rather a parameter dependent on the field strength of vacuum energy.

Determination of the value of G has been a topic of extensive research, with numerous experiments conducted over the years in an attempt to measure its precise value. These experiments, often employing high-precision techniques, have aimed to provide accurate measurements of G and establish a consensus on its exact value. However, the outcomes of these experiments have shown significant inconsistencies, making it difficult to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the value of G. This lack of consensus has puzzled scientists and called for alternative explanations.

To test the theoretical predictions regarding the field strength of vacuum energy, specific experimental conditions involving the position of the moon are recommended in the theoretical study. These conditions aim to achieve consistent outcomes in precision measurements of G. The ultimate goal of such experiments is to either falsify or provide confirmations to the proposed theoretical framework. The significance of exploring the field strength of vacuum energy lies in its potential to revolutionize our understanding of gravity and its interactions.

==History==
In 1934, Georges Lemaître used an unusual perfect-fluid equation of state to interpret the cosmological constant as due to vacuum energy. In 1948, the Casimir effect provided an experimental method for a verification of the existence of vacuum energy; in 1955, however, Evgeny Lifshitz offered a different origin for the Casimir effect. In 1957, Lee and Yang proved the concepts of broken symmetry and parity violation, for which they won the Nobel prize. In 1973, Edward Tryon proposed the zero-energy universe hypothesis: that the Universe may be a large-scale quantum-mechanical vacuum fluctuation where positive mass–energy is balanced by negative gravitational potential energy. During the 1980s, there were many attempts to relate the fields that generate the vacuum energy to specific fields that were predicted by attempts at a Grand Unified Theory and to use observations of the Universe to confirm one or another version. However, the exact nature of the particles (or fields) that generate vacuum energy, with a density such as that required by inflation theory, remains a mystery.

== Vacuum energy in fiction ==
* Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot; features a starship powered by a &quot;quantum drive&quot; based on aspects of this theory.
* In the sci-fi television/film franchise &quot;Stargate&quot;, a Zero Point Module (ZPM) is a power source that extracts zero-point energy from a micro parallel universe.
* The book &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual&quot; describes the operating principle of the so-called quantum torpedo. In this fictional weapon, an antimatter reaction is used to create a multi-dimensional membrane in a vacuum that releases at its decomposition more energy than was needed to produce it. The missing energy is removed from the vacuum. Usually about twice as much energy is released in the explosion as would correspond to the initial antimatter matter annihilation.
* In the video game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, the item generally known as the &quot;gravity gun&quot; is referred to as both the &quot;zero point field energy manipulator&quot; and the &quot;zero point energy field manipulator.&quot;

<text>In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) operates an awards program based on the certified number of albums and singles sold through retail and other ancillary markets. Other countries have similar awards (see music recording certification). Certification is not automatic; for an award to be made, the record label must first request certification. The audit is conducted against net shipments after returns (most often an artist&#x27;s royalty statement is used), which includes albums sold directly to retailers and one-stops, direct-to-consumer sales (music clubs and mail order) and other outlets.

== Audit of RIAA certifications ==
The association is popularly known for its traditional gold and platinum certification of albums and songs in the United States and also participates in collective recording rights management. The private company Gelfand, Rennert &amp; Feldman (GR&amp;F) is responsible for auditing RIAA sales. According to the Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s official website, &quot;All certification audits are conducted, for a fee, by Gelfand, Rennert and Feldman, LLP (GR&amp;F) for the RIAA. If multiple certification levels are certified simultaneously, only an audit certification fee will be charged.&quot; The RIAA website also mentions privately held Rennert and Feldman, LLP (GR&amp;F) as RIAA auditors in all certification correspondence.

== Description and qualifications ==
A Gold record is a song or album that sells 500,000 units (records, tapes, and compact discs). The award was launched in 1958; originally, the requirement for a Gold single was one million units sold and a Gold album represented $1 million in sales (at wholesale value, around a third of the list price). In 1975, the additional requirement of 500,000 units sold was added for Gold albums. Reflecting growth in record sales, the Platinum award was added in 1976, for albums that sold one million units and for singles selling two million units. The Multi-Platinum award was introduced in 1984, signifying multiple Platinum levels of albums and singles. In 1989, the sales thresholds for singles were reduced to 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum, reflecting a decrease in sales of singles. In 1992, RIAA began counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification. Reflecting additional growth in music sales, the Diamond award was instituted in 1999 for albums or singles selling ten million units. Because of these changes in criteria, the sales level associated with a particular award depends on when the award was made.

Nielsen SoundScan figures are not used in RIAA certification; the RIAA system predates Nielsen SoundScan and includes sales outlets Nielsen misses. Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, RIAA certification was the only audited and verifiable system for tracking music sales in the U.S.; it is still the only system capable of tracking 100% of sales (albeit as shipments less returns, not actual sales like Nielsen SoundScan). This system has permitted, at times, record labels to promote an album as Gold or Platinum simply based on large shipments. For instance, in 1978 the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; soundtrack shipped Platinum but was a sales bust, with two million returns. Similarly, all four solo albums by the members of Kiss simultaneously shipped Platinum that same year but did not reach the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The following year, the RIAA began requiring 120 days from the release date before recordings were eligible for certification, although that requirement has been reduced over the years and currently stands at 30 days. Upon criticism on why the RIAA won&#x27;t adopt SoundScan as its source, Hilary Rosen, president of the recording association, defended their system: &quot;We think the certification process represents an accurate sales picture and we’re comfortable with the numbers we release.&quot;

In the digital era, changes in the way music is consumed resulted in changes in the certification criteria. Actual album sales had dropped significantly, while digital download followed by streaming became increasingly dominant. On-demand audio and video streams started to be counted towards Digital Single units consumed in 2013. Track downloads and audio and video streams were then included in album certification in 2016 using formulas converting downloads and streams into the album units for certification purpose.

==List of certifications==
===Records===
* 500,000 units: Gold album
* 1,000,000 units: Platinum album
* 2,000,000+ (in increments of 1,000,000 thereafter) units: Multi-Platinum album
* 10,000,000 units: Diamond album

Starting from February 1, 2016, each album unit may be one of the following:
# Each permanent digital album or physical album sale;
# 10 tracks from the album downloaded;
# 1,500 on-demand audio or video streams of songs from the album.

====Multi-disc====
Multi-disc albums are counted once for each disc within the album if it is over 100 minutes in length or is from the vinyl era. For example, the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; (running time of 121:39) and OutKast&#x27;s &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; (running time of 134:56), both double albums, were counted twice, meaning each album was certified diamond after 5 million copies were shipped. Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;, both vinyl-era, are also counted as double even though their running times are under the minimum requirement. Rules may or may not apply depending on most recent staff within the Distributions position.

====Latin====

Since 2000, the RIAA also awards &quot;Los Premios de Oro y de Platino&quot; (Gold and Platinum Awards in Spanish) to Latin albums, which are defined by the RIAA as a type of product that features at least 51% of content in Spanish.

Note: The number of sales required to qualify for Oro and Platino awards was higher prior to January 1, 2008. The thresholds were 100,000 units (Oro) and 200,000 units (Platino). All Spanish-language albums certified prior to 2008 were updated to match the current certification at the time. &quot;La Bomba&quot; by Bolivian group Azul Azul is the only single to receive a Latin certification based on shipments before the creation of the Latin digital singles awards in 2013. The &quot;Disco de Diamante&quot; award was introduced after the RIAA updated the thresholds for Latin certifications on December 20, 2013. The &quot;Disco de Diamante&quot; is awarded to Latin albums that have been certified 10× Platinum.

===Singles===
Standard singles are certified:
* Gold when it ships 500,000 copies
* Platinum when it ships 1,000,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum when it ships at least 2,000,000 copies

Note: The number of sales required to qualify for Gold and Platinum discs was higher prior to January 1, 1989. The thresholds were previously 1,000,000 units (Gold) and 2,000,000 units (Platinum).

Digital singles are certified:
* Gold means 500,000 certification units
* Platinum means 1,000,000 certification units
* Multi-Platinum means 2,000,000+ certification units

From 2004 through July 2006, the certification level was 100,000 downloads for Gold and 200,000 for Platinum. When the RIAA changed the certification standards to match retail distribution in August 2006, all Platinum and Multi-Platinum awards for a digital release were withdrawn. Gold certifications, however, were not, meaning a song that was downloaded over 100,000 times and certified so by the RIAA during that time frame retains its Gold status.

Starting May 9, 2013, RIAA certifications for singles in the &quot;digital&quot; category include on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads at a rate of 100 streams = 1 certification &quot;unit&quot;. On February 1, 2016, this rate was updated to 150 streams = 1 certification unit.

Latin digital singles are certified:
* Disco de Oro (Gold) means 30,000 certification units
* Disco de Platino (Platinum) means 60,000 certification units
* Disco de Multi-Platino (Multi-Platinum) means 120,000+ certification units

The Latin Digital Single Awards began on December 20, 2013. As with the digital sales, 100 streams count as one download sale.

===Video Longform===
Along with albums, digital albums, and singles there is another classification of music release called &quot;Video Longform.&quot; This release format includes DVD and VHS releases, and certain live albums and compilation albums. The certification criteria are slightly different from other styles.

*Gold: 50,000 copies
*Platinum: 100,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum: 200,000 copies

===Video Single===
For Video Single certification, the title must contain no more than two songs and must have a running time of no more than 15 minutes. The certification criteria are:

*Gold: 25,000 copies
*Platinum: 50,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum: 100,000 copies

, the titles certified the most Video Single awards are &quot;Here Without You&quot; by 3 Doors Down and Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot;, both winning 6× Platinum for 300,000 copies. Since 2010, only 5 titles have been certified Video Single. The latest Gold was awarded to &quot;R40&quot; by Rush in 2017.

=== Video Box Set ===
The Video Box Set (or Multi-Box Music Video Set) award is a classification for video compilations that include three or more videos that are grouped and marketed together as a set. Like Video Longform, this includes DVD and VHS releases and the certification criteria are the same. Each individual video within set is counted as one toward certification.

*Gold: 50,000 copies
*Platinum: 100,000 copies
*Multi-Platinum: 200,000 copies

The best-selling video box set as certified by the RIAA is the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Four Flicks&quot; DVD compilation from their Licks World Tour, with a 19× Multi-Platinum designation. This was likely achieved due to exclusive distribution rights owned by retailer Best Buy by their short-lived music production company, Redline Entertainment.

=== Master Ringtone ===
Master Ringtone (mastertone) awards were introduced in 2006. Certification levels are identical to those of singles, 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum and 2,000,000+ Multi-Platinum.

Many Master Ringtone certifications were awarded until 2009, but since then only ten certifications were awarded in 2010, three in 2012 and three in 2019, all three to AC/DC.

<doc id="308160" wikidata="Q7149893" url="?curid=308160" title="Paul Coia">
<text>Paul Coia (born 19 June 1955 in Glasgow) is a Scottish television presenter and continuity announcer who was the first voice to be heard on Channel 4 on its launch in 1982. His career originally began in the late 1970s as a DJ and in the early 1980s he became an announcer. He has presented many television shows including &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; and &quot;Catchword&quot;. He is currently covering shows for BBC Radio Berkshire and London&#x27;s Radio Jackie, and coaches executives around the world in Communications. In November 2023 &quot;The Guardian&quot; named him as one of ten people who changed UK TV forever.

==Early life and career==
Paul Coia and his twin Gerard were born in 1955, and he had two younger siblings, Martin and Denise. Coia was educated at Merrylee Convent, John Ogilvie Hall and St Aloysius&#x27; College and then at the University of Glasgow and Paisley College of Technology (now University of the West of Scotland) to do a BSc degree course. His ambition was to become a dentist but it remained unrealised as his exam results were not to the level required. 

Coia instead moved into broadcasting where he started off as a hospital radio presenter in December 1976 and later gained a job as a disc jockey at Radio Clyde in June 1977. He started off presenting the weekend overnight slots, &quot;Friday into Saturday Morning&quot;, &quot;Saturday into Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;Sunday into Monday Morning&quot;, followed by spells presenting weekend shows, such as the Saturday morning show &quot;Children&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Coia returned to Radio Clyde as a relief cover presenter throughout the 1980s, 1990s and the 2000s.

In 1979, Coia made his TV debut with a guest appearance on the long-running No. 1 kids programme in Scotland Glen Michael&#x27;s Cartoon Cavalcade then became a continuity announcer and newsreader for Scottish Television. After dropping his script and continuing by ad libbing, Coia was given his own summer series &quot;Hi Summer&quot; in 1980 followed his own chat show, &quot;Meet Paul Coia&quot; in 1981.

In 1982 he joined Channel 4 on its launch and was the first voice heard on air. Unusually for continuity of the time, Coia could also occasionally be seen in-vision, usually before closedown. Subsequently, he became a presenter of BBC1&#x27;s daytime magazine programme, &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;. and BBC 2&#x27;s 6:55 where he replaced &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; actor David Soul.

During 1987, Coia made his second chat show, this time for Grampian Television &quot;The Paul Coia Show&quot; which was broadcast also on Scottish Television, and he also made his first gameshow, &quot;Split Second&quot;.

In 1988 Coia became the host of the BBC gameshow &quot;Catchword&quot;.

He stood in once with his wife Debbie Greenwood, a former Miss Great Britain winner, for Gloria Hunniford&#x27;s afternoon chat show on Five. They presented the weekend breakfast show on LBC together for a year, Coia and Greenwood also sat in for Derek and Ellen Jameson on the late-night show on BBC Radio 2, and Coia (broadcasting solo) also deputised for Ken Bruce, Ed Stewart and other presenters on that station, and hosted the station’s summer roadshows while also presenting on BBC One’s The Holiday Show, Coia also sat in for Jimmy Mack on Clyde 2&#x27;s drivetime show for a couple of weeks in September 1992. Coia also did cover work as a part-time presenter on BBC Radio Scotland throughout the 2000s.

In 2002, Coia created a quiz show for the BBC, &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;.

In 2005, Coia returned to Radio Clyde where he presented on the weekday lunchtime show from 12 – 3pm on Clyde 2, He covered for veteran presenter Bill Smith over the easter period A year later, Coia presented on Saturday afternoons from 2–6pm, covering for Super Scoreboard whilst the football season was off for the summer time.

Coia was a continuity announcer and trail voiceover (all pre-recorded) for the now-defunct digital channel ABC1. He has also been heard on 102.2 Smooth Radio since February 2008. Coia took over the Drivetime show from December 2008 until the end of 2010 after Martin Collins left the station. In April 2013 he became a Sunday morning presenter for BBC Radio Berkshire, discussing religious issues of the day and locality.

In 2017, he started to present BBC Radio London cover shows.

On 2 November 2022, forty years to the day after he introduced the first programme to be broadcast on Channel 4, Coia once again provided the continuity announcement for that day&#x27;s edition of Countdown.

Coia also works as a Presentation and Media coach and corporate speaker, hosting events and coaching executives in many countries. He occasionally presents on Radio Jackie.

Coia won the Radio Industry Club’s Scottish Radio Presenter of the Year award, other awards include Radio Personality of the Year, the Golden Rose of Montreaux (Rose D’Or) TV Awards, runner up in the BBC’s Gillards and a Webby award for corporate communication.

<doc id="308162" wikidata="Q237311" url="?curid=308162" title="Julia, Princess of Battenberg">
<text>Julia, Princess of Battenberg, previously Countess Julia von Hauke and Countess of Battenberg (born Julia Therese Salomea Hauke; – 19 September 1895), was the wife of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine, the third son of Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse. 

The daughter of a Polish general of German descent, Julia was not of royal origin. She became a lady-in-waiting to Marie of Hesse, wife of the future Russian Emperor Alexander II and a sister of Alexander, whom Julia married after meeting him in the course of her duties. Although the marriage of social unequals like Julia and Alexander was deemed morganatic, the Duke of Hesse made her Princess of Battenberg. Julia was the mother of Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria, and she is an ancestor of the current British and Spanish royal families.

==Life==

Hauke was born in Warsaw, Congress Poland, then ruled in personal union by the Russian emperor. She was the daughter of Hans Moritz Hauke, a Polish general of German descent. Her mother, Sophie, was the daughter of Polish military surgeon Franz Leopold Lafontaine.

Her father fought in Napoleon&#x27;s Polish Legions in Austria, Italy, Germany, and the Peninsular War. After his service in the army of the Duchy of Warsaw from 1809 to 1814, he entered the ranks of the army of Congress Poland, and was promoted to general in 1828. Recognizing his abilities, Emperor Nicholas I appointed him Deputy Minister of War of Congress Poland and on 4 May 1829 made him a hereditary Count von Hauke. In the November Uprising of 1830, led by rebelling army cadets, Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich, Poland&#x27;s Russian governor, managed to escape, but Julia&#x27;s father was shot dead by the cadets on a Warsaw street. Her mother died of shock shortly afterwards, and their children were made wards of the Emperor.

Hauke served as lady-in-waiting to Marie of Hesse, wife of the future Emperor Alexander II and a sister of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine. She met Prince Alexander while performing her duties at court in Saint Petersburg. The Emperor did not approve of a courtship between her and his son&#x27;s brother-in-law, so the two arranged to leave Saint Petersburg. By the time Julia and Alexander were able to marry, she was six months pregnant with their first child, Marie. They were married on 28 October 1851 in Breslau in Prussian Silesia (now called Wrocław and in Poland).

Since she was not considered equal for royal marriage purposes, her children did not qualify for succession to the throne of Hesse and by Rhine. Her marriage was declared to be morganatic after the birth of her first son. Her husband&#x27;s brother, Grand Duke Louis III of Hesse-Darmstadt, made her Countess of Battenberg in 1851, with the style of Illustrious Highness (). In 1858, she was elevated to Princess of Battenberg, with the style of Serene Highness (). Battenberg became the name of a morganatic branch of the Grand Ducal House of Hesse.

Hauke converted to Lutheranism on 12 May 1875. Prior to her conversion, she frequently visited Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches throughout Hesse, often traveling great distances. Her religion was openly criticized by members of her husband&#x27;s family until her conversion. Her children were baptized Lutheran. She died at Heiligenberg Castle on 19 September 1895.

==Children==
There were five children of the marriage, all princes and princesses of Battenberg:
* Princess Marie of Battenberg (1852–1923), married Gustav, Prince of Erbach-Schönberg (d. 1908) in 1871, and had issue.
* Prince Louis of Battenberg (1854–1921), married Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine (1863–1950) in 1884, and had issue (including Queen Louise of Sweden and Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma). In 1917, Louis and his descendants gave up their German titles and took the surname Mountbatten; Louis was later created the first Marquess of Milford Haven. Via his daughter Alice, whose only son, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, married Queen Elizabeth II, Louis is an ancestor of the current British royal family.
* Prince Alexander of Battenberg (1857–1893), elected Prince of Bulgaria 1879 and abdicated in 1886, married morganatically Johanna Loisinger (1865–1951) in 1889, and had issue.
* Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858–1896), married Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (1857–1944) in 1885, and had issue (including Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain, via whom he is an ancestor of the current Spanish royal family). In 1917, Henry&#x27;s descendants gave up their German titles and took the surname Mountbatten; his eldest son, Alexander, was later created the first Marquess of Carisbrooke.
* Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg (1861–1924), married Princess Anna of Montenegro (1874–1971) in 1897, and had no issue.

=== Descendants change name to Mountbatten ===
Julia&#x27;s eldest son, Louis, became a British subject, and during World War I, due to anti-German sentiment prevalent at the time, anglicised his name to &quot;Mountbatten&quot; (a literal translation of the German &quot;Battenberg&quot;), as did his nephews, the surviving sons of Prince Henry and Princess Beatrice. The members of this branch of the family also renounced all German titles and were granted peerages by their cousin King George V: Prince Louis became the 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Prince Alexander, Prince Henry&#x27;s eldest son, became the 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke.

<text>TAME or TAME EP Linea Aerea del Ecuador was an airline founded in Ecuador in 1962. TAME (pronounced &quot;tah-meh&quot;) was the flag carrier and the largest airline of Ecuador. TAME headquarters were in Quito, Pichincha Province and the main hub was Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Quito. The airline was formed by the Air Force of Ecuador. In 2011, it became a commercial entity and provided domestic, international and charter flights. On May 20, 2020, the Ecuadorean government decided to cease all operations and liquidate the airline.

==History==
===Early years===
The military airline was founded on December 17, 1962, by Luis A. Ortega under Guillermo Freile Posso, both colonels. It was named Transportes Aéreos Militares Ecuatorianos (TAME). At the time, the Air Force required an income source; governmental transport services to remote and difficult to reach parts of Ecuador; and an entity to train pilots. The airline gradually increased in size infrastructure and number of services.

On December 4, 1962, Luis A. Ortega, Hector Granja, Eduardo Sandoval, Alfredo Barreiro, Oswaldo Lara, Julio Espinosa, Teodoro Malo and Jose Montesinos made inaugural flights in the Douglas C-47. The pilots held the rank of major and noncommissioned officers worked as flight attendants. The first commercial flight was made by Teodoro Malo on a route from Quito, Esmeraldas, Bahía, Manta, Guayaquil, Cuenca and back to Quito. Initially, TAME made domestic flights using C-47 planes. Gradually, over the next two years, DC-3 and DC-6 planes were added and then in 1970, two HS-748 Avro were acquired.

On April 30, 1966, TAME began regular international flights to Havana, Panama and Santiago de Chile.

As its business grew, TAME purchased four Lockheed L-188 Electras from Ecuatoriana de Aviación. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, TAME added three Boeing 727-100s. During the mid-1980s and up until 1992, Tame purchased four Boeing 727-200s. In 1986, three Fokker F28 Fellowship 4000s were added. In December 1998, TAME rented a Boeing 757-200.

In December 1992, the governments of Ecuador and Colombia signed the &quot;Frontier Integration Agreement&quot; establishing a Quito, Esmeraldas (Tachina), Cali, Esmeraldas (Tachina), Quito route. In 1995, TAME offered flights from Quito to Bogotá for Air France passengers.

===Development during the 2000s===
In 2000, TAME began a long process of fleet renewal beginning with the renting of two Airbus A320s. These planes were delivered at the European Corporation Assemble factory, Toulouse and were renewed in 2008. Also in 2000, the Boeing 727s were retired. TAME found the Embraer 170/190s suited the airline&#x27;s needs. Over the next two years, two models of the 170 series and one of the 190 series were obtained. On August 25, 2008, one Airbus A319 was obtained and soon after the two Airbus A320s were replaced, completing the fleet renewal.

In 2011, Tame changed its legal status to a state-owned company, no longer under the administration of the Ecuadorian Air Force.

In 2013, TAME incorporated its first and only Airbus A330-200, formerly of Dubai’s Emirates, to cover flights to New York City. In addition, 3 Quest Kodiaks were incorporated for its subsidiary &quot;TAME Amazonía&quot; for the routes in the country&#x27;s Amazon. 

On May 19, 2020, the Ecuadorean government decided to liquidate the airline and ceased all operations. The airline, which had been struggling for several years, claimed that its difficulties were compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Logo==
TAME&#x27;s colours were blue, light blue, and gold as a decorative element. The original logo, designed by Luis A. Ortega symbolized the flight of a bird with a sun in the background. In 2009, the airline was rebranded with a new logo and colour palette.

==Destinations==
TAME&#x27;s hub was in Quito at Mariscal Sucre International Airport. TAME flew internationally to Cali in Colombia as well as Fort Lauderdale and New York in the United States. The main destinations in Ecuador were Guayaquil, Cuenca, Manta and Esmeraldas.

===Codeshare agreements===
In 1997, TAME extended its international schedule through an agreement with EVA Air of Taiwan. On December 1, 2010, a codeshare agreement was made with Copa Airlines.

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===

As of March 2020, the TAME fleet comprised the following aircraft:

===Historical fleet===
Since its foundation, the airline&#x27;s fleet has grown with the following aircraft:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On September 6, 1969 twelve men and one woman, armed with machine guns, hijacked two TAME Douglas C-47s at Mariscal Sucre Airport. The hijackers shot and killed one crewman and wounded another. The hijackers told the passengers that the hijacking was in retaliation for the deaths of several students during anti-government rioting at the University of Guayaquil in May 1969. Both aircraft flew to Tumaco, Colombia for refueling. One aircraft was left behind as the hijackers continued on to Panama&#x27;s Tocumen International Airport. After a thirty-minute refueling stop, the aircraft continued to Kingston, Jamaica. After a 71-minute refueling stop, the plane left Kingston at 9 p.m., finally landing in Cuba.

*On January 20, 1976, A TAME Hawker Siddeley HS 748 (registered HC-AUE) crashed while flying over mountainous terrain. The plane was flying at 10,000 feet then struck trees with its right wing, lost control and crashed into the side of a mountain. The plane was en route from Loja to Guayaquil&#x27;s José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport. Six crew members and 28 passengers died. There were eight survivors.

*On May 22, 1981, A TAME de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter (registered HC-BAX) crashed into a fog-shrouded mountain near Zumba. It was flying in formation with a Beech 200 (HC-BHG), which also crashed into the mountain. Fifteen passengers and three crew members on board died.

*On July 11, 1983, TAME Flight 173, a Boeing 737-200 crashed while on final approach to Mariscal Lamar International Airport in Cuenca. The crash was caused by the crew&#x27;s lack of training in the aircraft type. All 119 people on board were killed. This was the most lethal event in the history of Ecuadorian aviation.

*On November 20, 1984, A TAME de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter crashed into a hill while flying between Loja and Zumba. Twelve passengers and two crew members died.

*On September 12, 1988, A TAME Lockheed L-188 Electra with registration HC-AZY took off from Lago Agrio airport on a ferry flight to Quito with the &quot;number 2&quot; engine inoperative. Immediately after takeoff, the &quot;number 1&quot; engine exploded causing the aircraft to veer left and crash. Six crew members and one passenger died.

*On April 20, 1998, Air France Flight 422, a Boeing 727-200 (registered HC-BSU), crashed into the &quot;El Cable&quot; cerro minutes after taking off from Bogota&#x27;s El Dorado International Airport en route to Quito. In bad weather, the crew failed to execute proper departure procedures. Instead of turning, they flew in a straight line into the hill. Fifty-three passengers and crew members died.

*On January 28, 2002, TAME Flight 120, a Boeing 727-100 (registered HC-BLF), departed from Quito en route to Tulcán. Several minutes outside Tulcán, the control tower lost contact with the aircraft. The aeroplane collided with the Cumbal Volcano causing the death of all 94 passengers and crew. The crash occurred because the captain flew too fast into the final turn.

*On September 16, 2011, TAME Flight 148, an Embraer 190AR (registered HC-CEZ) departed from Loja Airport. On takeoff, the plane slid off the runway. All 97 passengers and 6 crew survived.

*On April 28, 2016, TAME Flight 173 from Quito landed at Cuenca airport in bad weather. The Embraer 190AR (registered HC-COX), slid off the runway. All 87 passengers and 6 crew survived.

<doc id="308174" wikidata="Q26925" url="?curid=308174" title="James, brother of Jesus">
<text>James the Just, or a variation of James, brother of the Lord ( from , and , , can also be Anglicized as &quot;Jacob&quot;), was, according to the New Testament, a brother of Jesus. He was the first leader of the Jerusalem Church of the Apostolic Age. Traditionally, it is believed he was martyred either in AD 62 by being stoned to death on the order of High Priest Ananus ben Ananus, or in AD 69 by being thrown off the pinnacle of the Temple by scribes and Pharisees and then clubbed to death. James, Joses, Simon, and Judas are mentioned as the brothers of Jesus as well as two or more unnamed sisters. (See Matthew 13:55; Mark 6:3.) 

Catholics and Orthodox Christians teach that James, along with others named in the New Testament as brothers of Jesus, were not the biological children of Mary, mother of Jesus, but were cousins of Jesus, or step-brothers from a previous marriage of Joseph (as related in the non-canonical Gospel of James). Others consider James to be the son of Mary and Joseph.

The Catholic tradition holds that this James is to be identified with James, son of Alphaeus, and James the Less. It is agreed by most that he should not be confused with James, son of Zebedee also known as James the Great.

==Epithet==
Eusebius records that Clement of Alexandria related, &quot;This James, whom the people of old called the Just because of his outstanding virtue, was the first, as the record tells us, to be elected to the episcopal throne of the Jerusalem church.&quot; Other epithets are &quot;James the brother of the Lord, surnamed the Just,&quot; and &quot;James the Righteous&quot;.

He is sometimes referred to in Eastern Christianity as &quot;James Adelphotheos&quot; (), meaning &quot;James the Brother of God&quot;. The oldest surviving Christian liturgy, the Liturgy of St James, uses this epithet.

==Leader of the Jerusalem Church==
===The Jerusalem Church===

The Jerusalem Church was an early Christian community located in Jerusalem, of which James and Peter were leaders. According to a universal tradition the first bishop was the Apostle James the Less, the &quot;brother of the Lord&quot;. His predominant place and residence in the city are implied by Galatians 1:19. Eusebius says he was appointed bishop by Saint Peter, James (the Greater), and John (II, i).

According to Eusebius, the Jerusalem church escaped to Pella during the siege of Jerusalem by the future Emperor Titus in 70 AD and afterwards returned, having a further series of Jewish bishops until the Bar Kokhba revolt in 130 AD. Following the second destruction of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the city as Aelia Capitolina, subsequent bishops were Greeks.

===Leader===
James the Just was &quot;from an early date, with Peter, a leader of the Church at Jerusalem and from the time when Peter left Jerusalem after Herod Agrippa&#x27;s attempt to kill him, James appears as the principal authority who presided at the Council of Jerusalem.&quot;

The Pauline epistles and the later chapters of the Acts of the Apostles portray James as an important figure in the Jewish Christian community of Jerusalem. When Paul arrives in Jerusalem to deliver the money he raised for the faithful there, it is to James that he speaks, and it is James who insists that Paul ritually cleanse himself at Herod&#x27;s Temple to prove his faith and deny rumors of teaching rebellion against the Torah (Acts 21:18). This was a charge of antinomianism. In Paul&#x27;s account of his visit to Jerusalem in Galatians 1:18-19, he states that he stayed with Cephas (better known as Peter) and James, the brother of the Lord, was the only other apostle he met.

Paul describes James as being one of the persons to whom the risen Christ showed himself, (1 Corinthians 15:3–8). In Galatians 2:9, Paul mentions James with Cephas (Peter) and John the Apostle as the three &quot;Pillars of the Church&quot;. Paul describes these pillars as the ones who will minister to the &quot;circumcised&quot; (in general Jews and Jewish Proselytes) in Jerusalem, while Paul and his fellows will minister to the &quot;uncircumcised&quot; (in general Gentiles) (Galatians 2:12), after a debate in response to concerns of the Christians of Antioch. The Antioch community was concerned over whether Gentile Christians need be circumcised to be saved, and sent Paul and Barnabas to confer with the Jerusalem church. James played a prominent role in the formulation of the council&#x27;s decision. James was the last named figure to speak, after Peter, Paul, and Barnabas; he delivered what he called his &quot;decision&quot; (Acts 15:13-21). The original sense is closer to &quot;opinion&quot;. James supported them all in being against the requirement (Peter had cited his earlier revelation from God regarding Gentiles) and suggested prohibitions about eating blood as well as meat sacrificed to idols and fornication. This became the ruling of the council, agreed upon by all the apostles and elders and sent to the other churches by letter.

===Modern interpretation===
The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; relates that &quot;James the Lord&#x27;s brother was a Christian apostle, according to St. Paul, although not one of the original Twelve Apostles.&quot; According to Protestant theologian Philip Schaff, James seems to have taken the place of James the son of Zebedee, after his martyrdom, around 44 AD.

Modern historians of the early Christian churches tend to place James in the tradition of Jewish Christianity; whereas Paul emphasized faith over observance of Mosaic Law, James is thought to have espoused the opposite position.

According to Schaff, James was the local head of the oldest church and the leader of the most conservative portion of Jewish Christianity. Scholar James D. G. Dunn has proposed that Peter was the &quot;bridge-man&quot; between the two other &quot;prominent leading figures&quot;, Paul and James the Just.

==Sources==
Apart from a handful of references in the synoptic Gospels, the main sources for the life of James the Just are the Pauline epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, Josephus, Eusebius and Jerome, the last two of which also quote the early Christian chronicler Hegesippus, and Epiphanius. There is no mention of James in the Gospel of John or the early portions of the Acts of the Apostles. The Synoptics mention his name, but provide no further information.

In the extant lists of Pseudo-Hippolytus of Rome, Dorotheus of Tyre, the Chronicon Paschale, and Dimitry of Rostov, he is the first of the Seventy Apostles though some sources, such as the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, state that &quot;these lists are unfortunately worthless&quot;.

===Josephus===

According to Josephus, in his work &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (), refers to the stoning of &quot;James the brother of Jesus&quot; by order of Ananus ben Ananus, a Herodian-era High Priest.

The James referred to in this passage is most likely the James to whom the &quot;Epistle of James&quot; has been attributed. The translations of Josephus&#x27; writing into other languages have at times included passages that are not found in the Greek texts, raising the possibility of interpolation, but this passage on James is found in all manuscripts, including the Greek texts.

The context of the passage is the period following the death of Porcius Festus, and the journey to Alexandria by Lucceius Albinus, the new Roman Procurator of Judea, who held that position from 62 CE to 64 CE. Because Albinus&#x27; journey to Alexandria had to have concluded no later than the summer of 62 CE, the date of James&#x27; death can be assigned with some certainty to around that year. The 2nd century chronicler Hegesippus also left an account of the death of James, and while the details he provides diverge from those of Josephus, the two accounts share similar elements.

Modern scholarship has almost universally acknowledged the authenticity of the reference to &quot;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James&quot; (τὸν ἀδελφὸν Ἰησοῦ τοῦ λεγομένου Χριστοῦ, Ἰάκωβος ὄνομα αὐτῷ) and has rejected its being the result of later Christian interpolation. Moreover, in comparison with Hegesippus&#x27; account of James&#x27; death, most scholars consider Josephus&#x27; to be the more historically reliable. Some scholars have noted Josephus is more sympathetic to James than to his brother.

===New Testament===
The New Testament mentions several people named James. The Pauline epistles, from about the sixth decade of the 1st century, have two passages mentioning a James. The Acts of the Apostles, written sometime between 60 and 150 AD, also describes the period before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. It has three mentions of a James. The Gospels, with disputed datings ranging from about 50 to as late as 130 AD, describe the period of Jesus&#x27;s ministry, around 30-33 AD. It mentions at least two different people named James. The author of the Epistle of Jude notes that he is a brother of James in that epistle&#x27;s opening paragraph.

====Epistle of James====

The &quot;Epistle of James&quot; has been traditionally attributed to James the Just since 253, but, according to Dan McCartney, it is now common for scholars to disagree on its authorship.

====Pauline epistles====
Paul mentions meeting James &quot;the Lord&#x27;s brother&quot; (τὸν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ κυρίου) and later calls him one of the pillars (στύλοι) in the Epistle to the Galatians :
A &quot;James&quot; is mentioned in Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians, 1 Corinthians 15:7, as one to whom Jesus appeared after his resurrection:
In the preceding verse, the same Greek word &quot;adelphos&quot; (brother) is used, but not in a blood-relation sense:
====Acts of the Apostles====
There is a James mentioned in Acts, which the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; identifies with James, the brother of Jesus: &quot;but he [Peter], beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. (Acts 12:17)

When Peter, having miraculously escaped from prison, must flee Jerusalem due to Herod Agrippa&#x27;s persecution, he asks for James to be informed (Acts 12:17).

James is also an authority in the early church at the Council of Jerusalem (James is quoting Amos 9:11–12): 
 James is presented as a principal author of the Apostolic Decree of Acts 15.

After this, there is only one more mention of James in Acts, meeting with Paul shortly before Paul&#x27;s arrest: &quot;And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.&quot; (Acts 21:17–18)

====Gospels====
The Synoptic Gospels, similarly to the Epistle to the Galatians, recognize a core group of three disciples (Peter, John and James) having the same names as those given by Paul. In the list of the disciples found in the Gospels, two disciples whose names are James, the son of Alphaeus and James, son of Zebedee are mentioned in the list of the twelve disciples: (Matthew 10:1–4)
And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew also mention a James as Jesus&#x27;s brother: &quot;Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judah, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.&quot;
The Gospel of John never mentions anyone called James, but mentions Jesus&#x27;s unnamed brothers as being present with Mary when Jesus attended the wedding at Cana (John 2:12), and later that his brothers did not believe in him (John 7:5).

===Church Fathers===
Fragment X of Papias (writing in the second century) refers to &quot;James the bishop and apostle&quot;.

Hegesippus (2nd century), in the fifth book of his Commentaries, mentions that James was made a bishop of Jerusalem but he does not mention by whom: &quot;After the apostles, James the brother of the Lord surnamed the Just was made head of the Church at Jerusalem.&quot;

Hegesippus (c.110–c.180), wrote five books (now lost except for some quotations by Eusebius) of &quot;Commentaries on the Acts of the Church&quot;. In describing James&#x27;s ascetic lifestyle, Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (Book II, 23) quotes Hegesippus&#x27; account of James from the fifth book of &quot;Commentaries on the Acts of the Church&quot;:
Clement of Alexandria (late 2nd century) wrote in the sixth book of his Hypotyposes that James the Just was chosen as a bishop of Jerusalem by Peter, James (the Greater) and John:
Clement, in the seventh book of the same work, relates also the following concerning him: 
According to Eusebius (3rd/4th century) James was named a bishop of Jerusalem by the apostles: &quot;James, the brother of the Lord, to whom the episcopal seat at Jerusalem had been entrusted by the apostles&quot;. Jerome wrote the same: &quot;James... after our Lord&#x27;s passion... ordained by the apostles bishop of Jerusalem...&quot; and that James &quot;ruled the church of Jerusalem thirty years&quot;.

Epiphanius (4th century), bishop of Salamis, wrote in his work &quot;The Panarion&quot; (AD 374–375) that &quot;James, the brother of the Lord died in virginity at the age of ninety-six&quot;.

According to Jerome (4th century), James, the Lord&#x27;s brother, was an apostle, too; Jerome quotes Scriptures as a proof in his work &quot;The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary&quot;, writing the following:
Pseudo-Andrew of Crete (7th century) wrote a biography of James, based entirely on earlier sources, mainly Eusebius.

===Early Christian apocrypha===
Some apocryphal gospels testify to the reverence Jewish followers of Jesus had for James. The Gospel of the Hebrews confirms the account of Paul in 1 Corinthians regarding the risen Jesus&#x27;s appearance to James. Jerome (5th century) quotes the non-canonical Gospel of the Hebrews: 

The Gospel of Thomas confirms the account of Paul in 1 Corinthians regarding the risen Jesus&#x27;s appearance to James. The Gospel of Thomas relates that the disciples asked Jesus, after his resurrection and before his Ascension, &quot;We are aware that you will depart from us. Who will be our leader?&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;No matter where you come [from] it is to James the Just that you shall go, for whose sake heaven and earth have come to exist.&quot;. Epiphanius (Panarion 29.4) describes James as a Nazirite.

The pseudepigraphical First Apocalypse of James associated with James&#x27;s name mentions that James and Jesus are not biological brothers, with a rather fragmentary account of the departure (possibly meaning martyrdom) of James appended to the bottom of the manuscript.

The pseudepigraphical Second Apocalypse of James names James&#x27;s father Theudas rather than Joseph, who is presented as the biological father of James.

The Apocryphon of James, the sole copy of which was found in the Nag Hammadi library and which may have been written in Egypt in the 3rd century, recounts a post-resurrection appearance of the risen Christ to James and Peter that James is said to have recorded in Hebrew.

The Gospel of James (or &quot;Infancy Gospel of James&quot;), a work of the 2nd century, also presents itself as written by James so that his authorship would lend authority.

In a 4th-century letter pseudographically ascribed to the 1st century Clement of Rome, James was called the &quot;bishop of bishops, who rules Jerusalem, the Holy Church of the Hebrews, and all the Churches everywhere&quot;.

==Relationship to Jesus, Mary and Joseph==
Jesus&#x27;s brothers James as well as Jude, Simon, and Joses are named in Matthew 13:55 and Mark 6:3 and mentioned elsewhere. James&#x27;s name always appears first in lists, which suggests he was the eldest among them. In &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; (20.9.1), Josephus describes James as &quot;the brother of Jesus who is called Christ&quot;.

Interpretation of the phrase &quot;brother of the Lord&quot; and similar phrases is divided between those who believe that Mary had additional children after Jesus (e.g., historian Charles Freeman) and those who hold the perpetual virginity of Mary (Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and some Protestants, such as many Anglicans and some Lutherans). The only Catholic doctrine which has been defined regarding the &quot;brothers of the Lord&quot; is that they are not biological children of Mary.

Near-contemporary sources insist that James was a &quot;perpetual virgin&quot; from the womb, a term which according to Robert Eisenman was later converted to his mother, Mary.

===Possible identity as younger half-brother, son of Mary and Joseph===
Some writers, such as R.V. Tasker and D. Hill, interpret the Matthew 1:25 statement that Joseph &quot;knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son&quot; as meaning that Joseph and Mary did have normal marital relations after Jesus&#x27;s birth, and that James, Joses, Jude, and Simon, were the natural sons of Mary and Joseph and, thus, half brothers of Jesus. Others, such as K. Beyer, point out that the Greek (&#x27;until&#x27;) after a negative &quot;often has no implication at all about what happened after the limit of the &#x27;until&#x27; was reached&quot;. Raymond E. Brown also argues that &quot;the immediate context favors a lack of future implication here, for Matthew is concerned only with stressing Mary&#x27;s virginity before the child&#x27;s birth&quot;.

In addition, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus&#x27;s brothers or siblings are often described together, without reference to any other relatives (Matthew 12:46–49, Mark 3:31–34, Mark 6:3, Luke 8:19–21, John 2:12, Acts 1:14), and Jesus&#x27;s brothers are described without allusion to others (John 7:2–5, 1 Corinthians 9:5. For example, Matthew 13:55–56 says, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this the carpenter&#x27;s son? Isn&#x27;t his mother&#x27;s name Mary, and aren&#x27;t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Jude? Aren&#x27;t all his sisters with us?&quot; and John 7:5 says, &quot;Even his own brothers did not believe in him.&quot;

Tertullian (), Bonosus of Nairus and Helvidius () were among the theologians who thought that Mary had children other than Jesus. Jerome asserts in his tract &quot;The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary&quot;, as an answer to Helvidius, that the term &quot;first-born&quot; was used to refer to any offspring that opened the womb, rather than definitely implying other children. Luke&#x27;s reporting of the visit of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus to the Temple of Jerusalem when Jesus was 12 years old makes no reference to any of Jesus&#x27;s half-brothers.

The modern scholar Robert Eisenman is of the belief that Luke, as a close follower of Pauline Gentile Christianity, sought to minimize the importance of Jesus&#x27;s family by whatever means possible, editing James and Jesus&#x27;s brothers out of the Gospel record. Karl Keating argues that Mary and Joseph rushed without hesitation straight back to Jerusalem, when they realized Jesus was lost, which they would surely have thought twice about doing if there were other children (Jesus&#x27;s siblings) to look after.

=== Possible identity as older stepbrother, son of Joseph by an earlier marriage ===
The Gospel of James (a 2nd-century apocryphal gospel also called the Protoevangelium of James or the Infancy Gospel of James) says that Mary was betrothed to Joseph and that he already had children. In this case, James was one of Joseph&#x27;s children from his previous marriage and, therefore, Jesus&#x27;s stepbrother.

The bishop of Salamis, Epiphanius, wrote too in his work &quot;The Panarion&quot; (AD 374–375) that &quot;...James (brother of Jesus) was Joseph&#x27;s son by Joseph&#x27;s first wife, not by Mary...&quot; He adds that Joseph became the father of James and his three brothers (Joses, Simeon, Judah) and two sisters (a Salome and a Mary or a Salome and an Anna) with James being the elder sibling. James and his siblings were not children of Mary but were Joseph&#x27;s children from a previous marriage. After Joseph&#x27;s first wife died, many years later when he was eighty, &quot;he took Mary (mother of Jesus)&quot;. According to Epiphanius the Scriptures call them &quot;brothers of the Lord&quot; to confound their opponents.

One argument supporting this view is that it would have been against Jewish custom for Jesus to give his mother to the care of John (who is not at all suspected to be a blood relative of Jesus) if Mary had other living sons. This is because the eldest son would take responsibility for his mother after the death of her husband; any other sons of Mary should have taken on this responsibility if they existed, therefore arguing against a direct natural brother relationship.

Also, Aramaic and Hebrew tended to use circumlocutions to point out blood relationships; it is asserted that just calling some people &quot;brothers of Jesus&quot; would not have necessarily implied the same mother. Rather, something like &quot;sons of the mother of Jesus&quot; would have been used to indicate a common mother. Scholars and theologians who assert this point out that Jesus was called &quot; son of Mary&quot; rather than &quot; son of Mary&quot; in his hometown (Mark 6:3).

=== Possible identity as cousin, son of a sister of Mary ===
James, along with the others named brothers of Jesus, are said by others to have been Jesus&#x27;s cousins. This is justified by the fact that cousins were also called brothers and sisters in Jesus&#x27;s native language, Aramaic, which, like Biblical Hebrew, does not contain a word for cousin. Furthermore, the Greek words and were not restricted to the meaning of a literal brother or sister in the Bible, nor were their plurals. Unlike some other New Testament authors, the apostle Paul had a perfect command of Greek, a language which has a specific word for &#x27;cousin&#x27; and another for &#x27;brother&#x27; calling James &quot;the brother of our Lord&quot; (Galatians 1:19).

Eusebius of Caesarea () reports the tradition that James the Just was the son of Joseph&#x27;s brother Clopas and therefore was of the brothers (which he interprets as cousin) of Jesus described in the New Testament. This is echoed by Jerome () in (&quot;On Illustrious Men&quot;) James is said to be the son of another Mary, wife of Clopas and the sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus in the following manner:
Jerome refers to the scene of the crucifixion in John 19:25, where three women named Mary Mary, the mother of Jesus, Mary of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene are said to be witnesses. John also mentions the sister of the mother of Jesus, often identified with Mary of Clopas due to grammar. Mary &quot;of Clopas&quot; is often interpreted as Mary, &quot;wife of Clopas&quot;. Mary of Nazareth and Mary of Clopas also need not be literally sisters, in light of the usage of the said words in Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic.

Mary of Clopas is suggested to be the same as &quot;Mary, the mother of James the younger and Joses&quot;, &quot;Mary the mother of James and Joseph&quot; and the &quot;other Mary&quot; in Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion and post-resurrection accounts in the Synoptic Gospels. Proponents of this identification argue that the writers of the Synoptics would have called this Mary, simply, &quot;the mother of Jesus&quot; if she was indeed meant to be the mother of Jesus, given the importance of her son&#x27;s crucifixion and resurrection: they also note that the mother of James and Joses is called &quot;Maria&quot;, whereas the mother of Jesus is &quot;Mariam&quot; or &quot;Marias&quot; in Greek. These proponents find it unlikely that Mary would be referred to by her natural children other than Jesus at such a significant time (James happens to be the brother of one Joses, as spelled in Mark, or Joseph, as in Matthew).

Jerome&#x27;s opinion suggests an identification of James the Just with the Apostle James, son of Alphaeus; &quot;Clopas&quot; and &quot;Alphaeus&quot; are thought to be different Greek renderings of the same Aramaic name &quot;Khalphai&quot;. Despite this, some biblical scholars tend to distinguish them; this is also not Catholic dogma, though a traditional teaching.

Since this Clopas is, according to Eusebius, Joseph of Nazareth&#x27;s brother (see above) and Mary of Clopas is said to be Mary of Nazareth&#x27;s sister, James could be related to Jesus by blood and law.

=== Possible identity as younger half-brother, son of Mary and a second husband ===
A variant on this is presented by James Tabor, who argues that after the early and childless death of Joseph, Mary married Clopas, whom he accepts as a younger brother of Joseph, according to the Levirate law. According to this view, Clopas fathered James and the later siblings, but not Jesus.

John Dominic Crossan suggested that James was probably Jesus&#x27;s older brother.

==Identification with James, son of Alpheus, and with James the Less==
A Mary is also mentioned as the mother of James, the Younger and of Joseph in the Gospel of Mark:

On the other hand, another Mary is mentioned as the mother of a James and of a Joseph in the Gospel of Matthew and in the Gospel of Mark:


Catholic interpretation generally holds that James, the Younger is the same James mentioned in Mark 16:1 and Matthew 27:56 and it is to be identified with James, the son of Alphaeus and James, the brother of Jesus. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, he is not identified with James the Great, although this is disputed by some.

===Possible identity with James, son of Alphaeus===

Jerome believed that the brothers of the Lord were Jesus&#x27;s cousins, thus amplifying the doctrine of perpetual virginity. Jerome concluded that James &quot;the brother of the Lord&quot;, (Galatians 1:19) is therefore James, son of Alphaeus, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, and the son of Mary Cleophas.

In two small but potentially important works of Hippolytus, &quot;On the Twelve Apostles of Christ&quot; and &quot;On the Seventy Apostles of Christ,&quot; he relates the following:

These two works of Hippolytus are often neglected because the manuscripts were lost during most of the church age and then found in Greece in the 19th century. As most scholars consider them spurious, they are often ascribed to Pseudo-Hippolytus. The two are included in an appendix to the works of Hippolytus in the voluminous collection of Early Church Fathers.

Thus James, the brother of the Lord would be the son of Alphaeus, who is the husband of Mary the wife of Cleophas or Mary the wife of Alphaeus. The identification of James as the son of Alpheus was perpetuated into the 13th century in the hagiography &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; by Jacobus de Voragine.

===Possible identity with James the Less===
Jerome also claimed that James &quot;the brother of the Lord&quot; is the same as James the Less. To explain this, Jerome first tells that James the Less must be identified with James, the son of Alphaeus, and reports in his work &quot;The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary&quot; the following:

After saying that James the Less is the same as James, the son of Mary of Cleophas, wife of Alphaeus and sister of Mary the Lord&#x27;s mother, Jerome describes in his work that James &quot;the brother of the Lord&quot; is the same as James, the son of Alpaheus and Mary of Cleophas:

Thus, Jerome concludes that James, the son of Alphaeus, James the Less, and James, brother of the Lord, are one and the same person.

===Other relationships===
Also, Jesus and James could be related in some other way, not strictly &quot;cousins&quot;, following the non-literal application of the term and the Aramaic term for &#x27;brother&#x27;. According to the apocryphal First Apocalypse of James, James is not the earthly brother of Jesus, but a spiritual brother who according to the Gnostics &quot;received secret knowledge from Jesus prior to the Passion&quot;.

==Death==
According to a passage found in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (20.9.1), &quot;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James&quot; met his death after the death of the procurator Porcius Festus but before Lucceius Albinus had assumed office which has been dated to 62. The High Priest Hanan ben Hanan (Ananus ben Ananus) took advantage of this lack of imperial oversight to assemble a Sanhedrin (literally a in Greek, a &quot;Sanhedrin of judges&quot;), which condemned James &quot;on the charge of breaking the law,&quot; then had him executed by stoning (&quot;Antiquities&quot; 20.9.1). Josephus reports that Hanan&#x27;s act was widely viewed as little more than judicial murder and offended a number of &quot;those who were considered the most fair-minded people in the city, and strict in their observance of the Law&quot;, who went so far as to arrange a meeting with Albinus as he entered the province in order to petition him successfully about the matter. In response, King Agrippa II replaced Ananus with Jesus son of Damneus.

Clement of Alexandria relates that &quot;James was thrown from the pinnacle of the Temple, and was beaten to death with a club&quot;.

Hegesippus cites that &quot;the Scribes and Pharisees placed James upon the pinnacle of the temple, and threw down the just man, and they began to stone him, for he was not killed by the fall. And one of them, who was a fuller, took the club with which he beat out clothes and struck the just man on the head&quot;.

Origen related an account of the death of James which gave it as a cause of the Roman siege of Jerusalem, something not found in the existing manuscripts of Josephus.

Eusebius wrote that &quot;the more sensible even of the Jews were of the opinion that this (James&#x27; death) was the cause of the siege of Jerusalem, which happened to them immediately after his martyrdom for no other reason than their daring act against him. Josephus, at least, has not hesitated to testify this in his writings, where he says, &quot;These things happened to the Jews to avenge James the Just, who was a brother of Jesus, that is called the Christ. For the Jews slew him, although he was a most just man.&quot;&quot;

Eusebius, while quoting Josephus&#x27; account, also records otherwise lost passages from Hegesippus (see links below) and Clement of Alexandria (&quot;Historia Ecclesiae&quot;, 2.23). Hegesippus&#x27; account varies somewhat from what Josephus reports and may be an attempt to reconcile the various accounts by combining them. According to Hegesippus, the scribes and Pharisees came to James for help in putting down Christian beliefs. The record says:
Vespasian&#x27;s siege and capture of Jerusalem delayed the selection of Simeon of Jerusalem to succeed James.

According to Philip Schaff in 1904, this account by &quot;Hegesippus has been cited over and over again by historians as assigning the date of the martyrdom to 69,&quot; though he challenged the assumption that Hegesippus gives anything to denote such a date. Josephus does not mention in his writings how James was buried.

==Feast day==
In the Catholic Church, the feast day of Philip the Apostle, along with that of James the Lesser (Catholics identify him with James the Just as the same person), was traditionally observed on 1 May, the anniversary of the church dedicated to them in Rome (now called the Church of the Twelve Apostles). Then this combined feast transferred to May 3 in the current ordinary calendar.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, James is commemorated as &quot;Apostle James the Just, brother of Our Lord&quot;, and as such, multiple days are assigned to his feasts. His first feast day in the church calendar year is on October 23. His next feast day is on the first Sunday after the feast of the Nativity, where he is commemorated with King David and Joseph the Betrothed. His final feast day is on January 4 among the Seventy Apostles. He is also commemorated on 26 December (Synaxis of the Mother of God). On 1 December occurs commemoration of his, Simeon and Zacharias relics translation in 351, and 25 May is commemoration of their relics discover also in 351.

Recent versions of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America and Lutheran Church have added commemoration on the traditional Eastern Orthodox date of October 23.

James is remembered (with Philip) in the Church of England with a Festival on 1 May.

==The ossuary controversy==

In the November 2002 issue of &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot;, André Lemaire of the Sorbonne University in Paris published the report that an ossuary bearing the inscription (&quot;James son of Joseph brother of Jesus&quot;) had been identified belonging to a collector, Oded Golan. The ossuary was exhibited at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, late that year; but on June 18, 2003, the Israeli Antiquities Authority published a report concluding, based on an analysis of the patina, that the inscription is a modern forgery. Specifically, it appeared that the inscription had been added recently and made to look old by addition of a chalk solution. Following this, the Ossuary was removed by the Royal Ontario Museum.

On December 29, 2004, Golan was indicted in an Israeli court along with three other men Robert Deutsch, an inscriptions expert who teaches at Haifa University; collector Shlomo Cohen; and antiquities dealer Faiz al-Amaleh. They were accused of being part of a forgery ring that had been operating for more than 20 years. Golan denied the charges against him. According to the BBC, &quot;when the police took Oded Golan into custody and searched his apartment they discovered a workshop with a range of tools, materials, and half finished &#x27;antiquities&#x27;. This was evidence for a fraud of a scale far greater than they had suspected.&quot; On March 14, 2012, Golan was declared not guilty of all charges of forgery, although with the judge saying this acquittal &quot;does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago&quot; and &quot;it was not proven in any way that the words &#x27;the brother of Jesus&#x27; necessarily refer to the &#x27;Jesus&#x27; who appears in Christian writings&quot; and that there is &quot;nothing in these findings which necessarily proves that the items were authentic&quot;.

The Israeli Antiquities Authority and several scholars still maintain that the James Ossuary is a modern forgery, and the artefact is not usually quoted by scholars of the historical Jesus.

<text>UUNET Technologies, Inc., formerly UUNET Communications Services, was an American commercial Internet service provider. Founded in 1987, it was one of the first and largest commercial ISPs and one of the early Tier 1 networks. It was based in Northern Virginia. Today, UUNET is an internal brand of Verizon Business (formerly MCI).

==History==

===Background===
Prior to its founding, access to Usenet and e-mail exchange from non-ARPANET sites was accomplished using a cooperative network of systems running the UUCP protocol over POTS lines. During the mid-1980s, growth of this network began to put considerable strain on the resources voluntarily provided by the larger UUCP hubs. This prompted Rick Adams, a system administrator at the Center for Seismic Studies, to explore the possibilities of providing these services commercially as a way to reduce the burden on the existing hubs.

===Early existence===
With funding in the form of a loan from Usenix, UUNET Communications Services began operations in 1987 as a non-profit corporation providing Usenet feeds, e-mail exchange, and access to a large repository of software source code and related information. The venture proved successful and shed its non-profit status within two years. At the same time, the company changed its name to UUNET Technologies. In 1990, UUNET launched its AlterNet service, which provided access to an IP backbone independent of the constraints of those operated by the government. That network lives on in a much larger form and serves as the core of a set of products that include access at dial-up and broadband speeds as well as web hosting. UUNET raised $6 Million from Accel Partners, Menlo Ventures, and New Enterprise Associates in 1993 and $8.2 million in 1996 for expanding its network and hiring new executives with experience in marketing.

In the mid-1990s, UUNET was the fastest-growing ISP, outpacing MCI and Sprint. At its peak, Internet traffic was briefly doubling every few months, which translates to 10x growth each year. However, the continuing UUNET claims of such growth (long after it had fallen to lower, albeit still substantial levels) artificially fueled the expectations of the dot-com and telecom companies of the late 1990s, leading to the dot-com bubble and crash in 2000/2001.

===Mergers and acquisitions===

In 1996, UUNET was acquired by MFS on 30 April 1996. This was an independent acquisition unrelated to the acquisition of MFS by WorldCom. However, as MFS was a public company and the acquisition made the company a Wall Street darling, it likely influenced WorldCom&#x27;s decision to pursue MFS.

In 1996, UUNET was acquired by WorldCom on 26 August 1996, as part of WorldCom&#x27;s purchase of MFS Communications Company.

In 2001, UUNET was fully integrated with WorldCom and the name was dropped from all official documents.

In 2002, the owner of UUNET at that time (WorldCom) filed for what was then the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in history.

In 2005, its Internet service and infrastructure, assigned AS701, maintained the highest outdegree of any ISP.

===Verizon===

In 2006, WorldCom was purchased by Verizon Communications and now operates under the Verizon Business name.

==Spam==

After it had been sold and resold during the onset of the dot-com bubble, UUNET acquired the nickname &quot;SpewSpewNET&quot;. This nickname was given because UUNET had become a home for many distributors of spam, including distributors of both Newsgroup spam and E-mail spam. UUNET also became known for providing bulletproof hosting to many web pages whose chief form of advertisement was spam. Because UUNET started with a loan from Usenix and controlled the e-mail addresses for moderated Usenet groups, it was hard to block email traffic to or from Usenet. In 1997, UUNET had lost so much credit that on 1 August, after finding alternate routes for moderated newsgroups, a Usenet death penalty (UDP) was issued against UUNET. A week later, the UDP was lifted. In 1998 UUNET threatened legal action for hosting a GIF image with &quot;SPAMUNET&quot; on it.

<doc id="308180" wikidata="Q4514912" url="?curid=308180" title="Chess Player's Chronicle">
<text>The Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle, founded by Howard Staunton and extant in 1841–56 and 1859–62, was the world&#x27;s first successful English-language magazine devoted exclusively to chess. Various unrelated but identically or similarly named publications were published until 1902.
The earliest chess magazine in any language was the French &quot;Le Palamède&quot;, published in 1836–39 and 1842–47. In 1837 George Walker introduced an English-language magazine, the &quot;Philidorian&quot;, that was devoted to &quot;chess and other scientific games&quot;. Only six issues of it were published, and it expired in May 1838.

The &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; became the first successful English-language chess magazine. In 1840 or 1841 Staunton bought the fortnightly magazine &quot;The British Miscellany and Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;. In 1841 it became the &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;. In 1843, the &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; became a shilling monthly magazine.

Staunton &quot;made the inclusion of a large number of games by himself and other leading players of the day a special feature&quot; of the magazine. He also used the magazine as a forum for attacking others. For example, in an early issue, he included the following in &quot;Notices to Correspondents&quot;:
A Barrister, Temple.—Calls our attention to the ridiculous alteration of the Laws of Chess, by G. Walker, in his &quot;New Treatise on Chess&quot;, and asks, &quot;Is it possible such absurdities are sanctioned by the London Chess Club?&quot; The only sanction give to Walker&#x27;s puerilities by the Committee is to laugh at them. His books on Chess are no authority except among the lowest class of players.

Staunton was the owner and editor of the magazine until the early 1850s, when he sold it to R.B. Brien. Brien became editor of the magazine, but was unable to continue its success and discontinued it in 1856 because of financial losses and his own illness. It reappeared in 1859 under the editorship of Ignatz Kolisch, Adolf Zytogorski, and Josef Kling, but survived only until July 1862.

Thereafter, a number of magazines appeared with the same or similar name appeared.
Arthur Skipworth, assisted by William Wayte and Charles Ranken, wrote &quot;The Chess Players&#x27; Quarterly Chronicle&quot;, which was published in York from February 1868 to December 1871. Skipworth, who had left Bilsdale for Tetford Rectory, and John Wisker became the editors of the new &quot;The Chess Players&#x27; Chronicle&quot; in February 1872. Johann Löwenthal began writing for it in 1873. The magazine ran until 1875.

In January 1876, it was succeeded by &quot;The Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, whose editor-in-chief was J. Jenkin of Helensburgh. Its editorial staff consisted of Jenkin, Skipworth, Ranken, Wayte, and Andrew Hunter of Glasgow. Billed as a &quot;monthly record of provincial chess&quot;, it was published at Glasgow, costing sixpence. Its short run under Jenkin&#x27;s editorship was marked by xenophobia. The February issue stated that the West End Club had &quot;cleared away the disturbing foreign element which whilom infected the Divan&quot; and referring to Wilhelm Steinitz as &quot;the hot-headed little Austrian&quot;. Its third and last issue was published in March.

The magazine reappeared in January 1877. It was now under Ranken&#x27;s editorship, assisted by J. Crum, G. B. Fraser, Skipworth, and Wayte. The first issue apologized for &quot;certain offensive statements and insinuations, seriously affecting the honour of some eminent players&quot;, and explained that some members of the present editorial staff had only contributed games and other inoffensive material to it in 1875. Ranken continued to edit the magazine until September 1880. In 1881, the title was enlarged to &quot;The Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle, and Journal of Indoor and Outdoor Sports&quot;, and &quot;the magazine&#x27;s importance in the chess world was no longer the same&quot;.

None of these magazines compared in quality with what Staunton had achieved, and the success of the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot;, by the turn of the century a superior publication, put an end to the title in 1902.

<text>Philip John Schuyler (; November 20, 1733 - November 18, 1804) was an American general in the Revolutionary War and a United States Senator from New York. He is usually known as Philip Schuyler, while his son is usually known as Philip J. Schuyler.

Born in Albany, Province of New York, into the prosperous Schuyler family, Schuyler fought in the French and Indian War. He won election to the New York General Assembly in 1768 and to the Continental Congress in 1775. He planned the Continental Army&#x27;s 1775 Invasion of Quebec, but poor health forced him to delegate command of the invasion to Richard Montgomery. He prepared the Continental Army&#x27;s defense of the 1777 Saratoga campaign, but was replaced by Major General Horatio Gates as the commander of Continental forces in the theater. Schuyler resigned from the Continental Army in 1779.

Schuyler served in the New York State Senate for most of the 1780s and supported the ratification of the United States Constitution. He represented New York in the 1st United States Congress but lost his state&#x27;s 1791 Senate election to Aaron Burr. After a period in the state senate, he won election to the United States Senate again in 1797, affiliating with the Federalist Party. He resigned due to poor health the following year. He was the father of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton and the father-in-law of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton.

==Early life==
Philip John Schuyler was born on in Albany, New York, to Cornelia Van Cortlandt (1698–1762) and Johannes (&quot;John&quot;) Schuyler Jr. (1697–1741), the third generation of the Dutch Schuyler family in America. His maternal grandfather was Stephanus Van Cortlandt, the 17th Mayor of New York City.

Before his father died on the eve of his eighth birthday, Schuyler attended the public school in Albany. Afterward, he was educated by tutors at the Van Cortlandt family estate at New Rochelle. Fluent in both Dutch and English from childhood, in 1748 he began to study with Reverend Peter Strouppe at the New Rochelle French Protestant Church, where he learned French and mathematics. While he was at New Rochelle he also joined numerous trade expeditions where he met Iroquois leaders and learned to speak Mohawk.

Schuyler joined the British forces in 1755 during the French and Indian War, raised a provincial company, and was commissioned as its captain by his cousin, Lieutenant Governor James Delancey. In 1756, he accompanied British officer Colonel John Bradstreet to Oswego, where he gained experience as a quartermaster, which ended when the outpost fell to the French. Schuyler took part in the battles of Lake George, Oswego River, Carillon and Fort Frontenac.

After the war, Bradstreet sent Schuyler to England to settle Bradstreet&#x27;s reimbursement claims for expenses he incurred during the war effort, and he remained in England from 1760 to 1763. After returning to British America he took over management of several farms and business enterprises in upstate New York, including a lumber venture in Saratoga. In addition, Schuyler was responsible for constructing the first flax mill in the American colonies. Schuyler became colonel and commander of a militia district regiment in 1767. In 1768, he served as a member of the New York Assembly.

==American Revolution==
Schuyler was elected to the Continental Congress in 1775 and served until he was appointed a major general of the Continental Army in June. General Schuyler took command of the Northern Department and planned the Invasion of Quebec. His poor health required him to place Richard Montgomery in command of the invasion. In 1777, he again served in the Continental Congress.

===Saratoga campaign===

After returning to the command of the Northern Department in 1777, Schuyler was active in preparing a defense against the Saratoga Campaign, part of a British &quot;Three Pronged Attack&quot; strategy to cut the American Colonies in two by invading and occupying New York. During his preparation efforts, Schuyler complained to Major General William Heath about the quality of the reinforcements sent to him, writing that &quot;one third of the few that have been sent are boys, aged men and negroes, who disgrace our arms... Is it consistent with the Sons of Freedom to trust their all to be defended by slaves?&quot;

In the summer of 1777, John Burgoyne marched his army south from Quebec and through the valleys of Lakes Champlain and George. On the way he invested the small American garrison occupying Fort Ticonderoga at the nexus of the two lakes. When General Arthur St. Clair abandoned Fort Ticonderoga in July, Congress replaced Schuyler with General Horatio Gates, who had accused Schuyler of dereliction of duty. In 1778, Schuyler and Arthur St. Clair faced a court of inquiry over the loss of Ticonderoga, and both were acquitted.

The British offensive was eventually stopped by Continental Army then under the command of conflict and Benedict Arnold in the Battles of Saratoga. That victory, the first complete victory over a large British force, marked a turning point in the revolution, for it convinced France to enter the war on the American side. When Schuyler demanded a court martial to answer Gates&#x27; charges, he was vindicated but resigned from the Continental Army on April 19, 1779. He then served in two more sessions of the Continental Congress in 1779 and 1780.

==Later career==
As a prominent politician and Patriot leader in New York, Schuyler was the subject of an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, which was plotted and led by John Walden Meyers on August 7, 1781. Schuyler was able to vacate his Albany mansion before the kidnappers arrived. Schuyler was an original member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

After the war, he expanded his Saratoga estate to tens of thousands of acres, adding slaves, tenant farmers, a store, and mills for flour, flax, and lumber. He built several schooners on the Hudson River, and named the first &quot;Saratoga&quot;. According to the Schuyler Mansion Historic Society, there were around 40 slaves between the Albany and Saratoga estates.

He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1780 to 1784, and at the same time New York State Surveyor General from 1781 to 1784. Afterwards he returned to the State Senate from 1786 to 1790, where he actively supported the adoption of the United States Constitution.

In 1789, he was elected a U.S. Senator from New York to the First United States Congress, serving from July 27, 1789, to March 3, 1791. After losing his bid for re-election in 1791 to Aaron Burr, he returned to the State Senate from 1792 to 1797. In 1797, he was selected again to the U.S. Senate and served in the 5th United States Congress from March 4, 1797, until his resignation because of ill health on January 3, 1798.

==Personal life==
According to the Schuyler Family&#x27;s Bible, on September 7, 1755, he married Catherine Van Rensselaer (1734–1803) at Albany. In the Bible entry, he was called &quot;Philip Johannes Schuyler&quot; and she was called &quot;Catherina Van Rensselaer&quot;. She was the daughter of Johannes Van Rensselaer (1707/08–1783) and his first wife, Engeltje Livingston (1698–1746/47). Johannes was the grandson of Hendrick van Rensselaer (1667–1740). Engeltje was the daughter of Robert Livingston the Younger. Philip and Catherine had 15 children together, eight of whom survived to adulthood, including:

* Angelica Schuyler (1756–1814), who married John Barker Church (1748–1818), later a British MP.
* Elizabeth Schuyler (1757–1854), who married Alexander Hamilton (1755/7–1804), later the first United States Secretary of the Treasury. Elizabeth co-founded the first private orphanage in New York City. 
* Margarita &quot;Peggy&quot; Schuyler (1758–1801), who married Stephen Van Rensselaer III (1764–1839), 8th Patroon. 
* Cornelia Schuyler (1761–1762), a twin to the first John Bradstreet.
* Unnamed Son Schuyler (1761–1761), a twin to Cornelia.
* John Bradstreet Schuyler (1763–1764).
* John Bradstreet Schuyler (1765–1795), who married Elizabeth Van Rensselaer (1768–1841), the sister of Stephen Van Rensselaer III who married his sister Peggy. 
* Philip Jeremiah Schuyler (1768–1835), who served in the U.S. House of Representatives and who married Sarah Rutsen; after her death in 1805, he married Mary Anna Sawyer.
* Triplets (1770–1770, Unbaptized).
* Rensselaer Schuyler (1773–1847), who married Elizabeth Ten Broeck, daughter of General Abraham Ten Broeck.
* Cornelia Schuyler (1776–1808), who married Washington Morton.
* Cortlandt Schuyler (1778–1778).
* Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler (1781–1857), who married first, Samuel Malcolm (son of William Malcolm), and then James Cochran (1769–1848), her cousin and the son of John Cochran and Gertrude Schuyler, Philip Schuyler&#x27;s sister.

Schuyler&#x27;s country home had been destroyed by General John Burgoyne&#x27;s forces in October 1777. Later that year, he began rebuilding on the same site, now located in southern Schuylerville, New York. This later home is maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Saratoga National Historical Park, and is open to the public.

Schuyler died at the Schuyler Mansion in Albany on November 18, 1804, four months after his son-in-law, Alexander Hamilton, was killed in a duel and 2 days before his 71st birthday. He is buried at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.

===Place names===
Geographic locations and buildings named in Schuyler&#x27;s honor include:
* Schuyler, New York
* Schuylerville, New York
* Schuyler County, New York, as well as Schuyler County, Illinois, and Schuyler County, Missouri
* Fort Schuyler, a military fortification begun in 1833 at the tip of Throggs Neck in the Bronx, which now houses the Maritime Industry Museum and the State University of New York Maritime College

===Works of art===
Schuyler was depicted by John Trumbull in his 1821 painting &quot;Surrender of General Burgoyne&quot;, which hangs in the United States Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C.

&quot;Major General Philip Schuyler&quot;, a bronze statue by sculptor J. Massey Rhind, was erected outside Albany City Hall in 1925. In June 2020, Albany mayor Kathy Sheehan signed an executive order for the statue to be removed and given to a &quot;museum or other institution for future display with appropriate historical context&quot;, due to Schuyler&#x27;s ownership of slaves. The statue was requested the next day by the mayor of Schuylerville, New York, who suggested that it be relocated to Schuyler House. In the early morning of June 10, 2023, the statue was removed from its pedestal to a trailer and transported to an undisclosed storage location. After the statue was removed on June 10, 2023, a time capsule was discovered underneath in a sealed metal box.

===In popular culture===
The non-speaking role of Philip Schuyler was originated by ensemble member Sydney James Harcourt in the 2015 Broadway musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;, in which Schuyler&#x27;s son-in-law Alexander Hamilton is the title character.

<text>John Shakespeare ( – 7 September 1601) was an English businessman and politician who was the father of William Shakespeare. Active in Stratford-upon-Avon, he was a glover and whittawer (leather worker) by trade. Shakespeare was elected to several municipal offices, serving as an alderman and culminating in a term as bailiff, the chief magistrate of the town council, and mayor of Stratford in 1568, before he fell on hard times for reasons unknown. His fortunes later revived and he was granted a coat of arms five years before his death, probably at the instigation and expense of his son, the actor and playwright.

He married Mary Arden, with whom he had eight children, five of whom survived into adulthood.

== Career and municipal responsibilities ==
He was the son of Richard Shakespeare of the Warwickshire village of Snitterfield, a farmer.

John Shakespeare moved to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1551, where he became a successful businessman involved in several related occupations. At this time, Stratford had a population of 1500 people and only 200 houses. From 1556 to 1592, several official records identify him as a glovemaker, which was probably his primary trade, as tradition remembers him as following that trade even into his old age, but the records of his real estate purchases and legal expenses indicate an income much higher than that of a small-town tradesman. The administration of his father&#x27;s estate in 1561 names him as a farmer. He inherited and leased agricultural lands and is on record as selling timber and barley. Court records also document him as a &quot;brogger&quot;, an unlicensed—and therefore illegal—wool dealer. In addition, he bought and leased out houses. He was twice taken to court for violating the usury laws that prohibited charging interest higher than the legal limit of 10 per cent.
By 1552 he was residing in a house on Henley Street. On 2 October 1556, he purchased a house on the same street, the eastern wing of what is now called Shakespeare&#x27;s Birthplace. Whether the house he bought in 1556 was the same house he had lived in during 1552 is unknown. In 1576, he bought two houses to the west and joined the three together.

In 1556, Shakespeare was elected borough ale taster, the first of several key municipal positions he was to hold in Stratford. In that position he was responsible for ensuring that weights and measures and prices were observed by innkeepers and publicans within the borough, and also by butchers, bakers and town traders. In 1558 he was appointed borough constable – a position similar to an early police constable. In 1559 he became an affeeror, an officer responsible for assessing fines for offences carrying penalties not explicitly defined by existing statutes. This role led to his becoming a burgess, then a chamberlain. He would have been known as a &#x27;Goodman&#x27;, a title that recognised his growing social status within Stratford. By 1564, Shakespeare was an alderman, a member of the Common Hall of Stratford, and it was in this year that William was born.

In 1568, Shakespeare was appointed High Bailiff, the present-day equivalent of mayor, elected by the common council of burgesses and aldermen, which entitled him to be referred to as Master John Shakespeare. In that capacity he presided at the sessions of the Court of Record and at council meetings. For his borough the bailiff was almoner, coroner, escheator, and clerk of the market, and served as justice of the peace issuing warrants and negotiating with the lord of the manor on behalf of the corporation.

In 1569, Shakespeare had applied for a coat of arms; the application—subsequently withdrawn—included a vague claim of an ancestor having been honoured by King Henry VII, a draft of which application (with parenthetical additions representing amendments to be made in a successive draft) read: &quot;John Shakespeare ... whose parentes and late antecessors [grandfather] were for there [his] valeant and faithefull service advaunced and rewarded by the most prudent prince king Henry the Seventh of famous memorie, sythence whiche tyme they have continewed ... in good reputation and credit ...&quot;. After a long period of dormancy, arms were granted by William Dethick of the College of Arms on 20 October 1596. Most historians believe that his son, William, re-opened the application following his literary and financial success in London. This application additionally made reference to John Shakespeare having married &quot;the daughter and heir of Arden, a gentleman of worship&quot;.

==Marriage into the local gentry==

He married Mary Arden, one of the Ardens of Warwickshire, a local gentry family and reportedly a niece of John Shakespeare&#x27;s father Richard Shakespeare. It is not known when they married, but a date around 1557 is assumed as there is a baptismal record for a &quot;Joan Shakespeare, daughter to John Shakespeare&quot; dated 15 September 1558.

The Shakespeares had eight children:
*Joan (baptised 15 September 1558, died in infancy),
*Margaret (bap. 2 December 1562buried 30 April 1563),
*William (bap. 26 April 156423 April 1616),
*Gilbert (bap. 13 October 1566bur. 2 February 1612),
*Joan (bap. 15 April 1569bur. 4 November 1646),
*Anne (bap. 28 September 1571bur. 4 April 1579),
*Richard (bap. 11 March 1574bur. 4 February 1613) and
*Edmund (bap. 3 May 1580bur. London, 31 December 1607).

==Risk taking and financial problems==
Shakespeare fell on hard times in the late 1570s that would last until the early 1590s. He failed to attend council meetings, attending just once (on 5 September 1582) between January 1577 and 6 September 1586 when he lost his position as an alderman for non-attendance. In 1592, he was recorded as among several local men who stayed away from Church services for fear of being arrested for debt. Records indicate that he was also prosecuted in the 1570s for usury and for illegal dealing in wool. Such illicit trade would have been profitable to his glove business by avoiding the middleman. In 1570, he was accused of making loans to a Walter Mussum, worth £220 (equivalent to over £50,000 in 2007), including interest. Mussum was not a good risk; at his death, his whole estate was worth £114, or barely half what Shakespeare had lent him. The financial risk was just one side of his potentially problematic business activity. The law described usury as &quot;a vice most odious and detestable&quot; and levied severe penalties for those caught in such practices, even in a small way. The law stated that anyone caught lending money with interest illegally would forfeit all the money lent, plus forfeiture of any interest due, face a hefty fine on top and also possible imprisonment. He was also engaged in trading wool illegally in 1571, when he acquired 300 tods (or ) of wool, a large consignment.

In 1576, Shakespeare withdrew from public life in Stratford. He had been excused levies that he was supposed to pay by supportive townsmen and business associates and they kept his name on the rolls for a decade, perhaps hoping that in that time he would be able to return to public life and recover his financial situation, but he never did so. He is mentioned in the local records in 1597 when he sold some property to George Badger, a draper.

John Shakespeare was buried on 8 September 1601 at Holy Trinity Church, Stratford.

==Personality and religious beliefs==

The only record that survives of Shakespeare&#x27;s personality is a note written by Thomas Plume fifty years after his death. Plume records a conversation with Sir John Mennes (1599–1671), who stated that he had once met him in his shop and described him as a &quot;merry cheeked old man&quot; who said of his son that &quot;Will was a good honest fellow, but he durst have cracked a jest with him at any time.&quot; As Katherine Duncan-Jones points out, this is impossible, since Mennes was two years old when John Shakespeare died. She thinks Plume may have been recording an anecdote related by Mennes taken from his father.

Shakespeare and his immediate family were conforming members of the established Church of England. John Shakespeare was elected to several municipal offices, which required being a church member in good standing. William Shakespeare&#x27;s baptism and that of his siblings were entered into the parish church register, as were the burials of family members. Shakespeare, acting as town chamberlain and in accordance with Elizabeth I&#x27;s injunction of 1559 to remove &quot;all signs of superstition and idolatry from places of worship&quot;, covered over the wall-paintings of the Chapel of the Guild of the Holy Cross some time in the 1560s or 1570s; his contemporary record detailed paying two shillings for &quot;defasyng ymages in þe chapel&quot; (&quot;defacing images in the chapel&quot;).

However, some scholars believe there is evidence that several members of Shakespeare&#x27;s family were secretly recusant Roman Catholics. Mary Arden was from a Catholic family. A tract, apparently signed by a &quot;J. Shakespeare&quot;, in which the author pledged to remain a Catholic in their heart, was found in the 18th century in the rafters of a house on Henley Street. It was seen and described by scholar Edmond Malone but apparently was subsequently lost (see Religious views of William Shakespeare#Shakespeare&#x27;s family). Anthony Holden writes that Malone&#x27;s reported wording of the tract is linked to a testament written by Charles Borromeo and circulated in England by Edmund Campion, copies of which still exist in Italian and English. Other research suggests the Borromeo testament dated from 1638 at the earliest and could never have been in the possession of John Shakespeare, rather than his daughter, Joan Shakespeare. The first leaf of the document had been forged by John Jordan who acquired the manuscript and attempted to have it published. Scholar Matthew Steggle believes that the &quot;Testament&quot; cannot chronologically belong to John but instead may be by his daughter Joan (William&#x27;s sister), and that its discoverer, John Jordan, forged the missing first page and misread the name &quot;Joan&quot; for &quot;John.&quot;

<text>Potoroidae is a family of marsupials, small Australian animals known as bettongs, potoroos, and rat-kangaroos. All are rabbit-sized, brown, jumping marsupials and resemble a large rodent or a very small wallaby.

== Taxonomy ==
The potoroids are smaller relatives of the kangaroos and wallabies, and may be ancestral to that group. In particular, the teeth show a simpler pattern than in the kangaroo family, with longer upper incisors, larger canines, and four cusps on the molars. However, both groups possess a wide diastema between the incisors and the cheek teeth, and the potoroids have a similar dental formula to their larger relatives:

In most respects, however, the potoroids are similar to small wallabies. Their hind feet are elongated, and they move by hopping, although the adaptations are not as extreme as they are in true wallabies, and, like rabbits, they often use their fore limbs to move about at slower speeds.

The potoroids are, like nearly all diprotodonts, largely herbivorous. However, while they take a wide variety of plant foods, most have a particular taste for the fruiting bodies of fungi, and often depend on fungi to see them through periods when little else is available to eat in the dry Australian bush. One example of a potoroo that sustains itself on fungi is the long-footed potoroo. This animal&#x27;s diet is almost entirely made up of underground fungi. This limits its habitat range as it needs to live in a moist environment, with dense cover to reduce predation from introduced species such as foxes and feral cats.

== Ecology ==
The once populous species of this family played a role in the engineering of soil, dominating the sub-storey of vegetation, and regarded as crucial to the maintenance of the friable soils that they created by digging for fungi and other subsoil foods.

== Status ==
Four modern species of bettongs are extant and two have become extinct. Bettongs were endangered because settlers took much of their habitat, and the red foxes they introduced to the continent also killed many of them. At one time, several species lived all over Australia. Today, the Tasmanian bettong lives only in the eastern half of Tasmania, and the northern bettong lives only in three isolated populations in northern Queensland.

The potoroines have exemplified the impact of ecological changes since colonisation of Australia. Most species have become extinct within their former distribution range, and are either totally extinct or conserved only by preservation in isolated habitat and re-population programs.

== Classification ==

A basal branch of the macropods, the three extant genera of the Potoroidae contain eight species.

The arrangements of the related taxa have seen an arrangement of the subfamilies within Potoroidae, although an earlier classification within the family Macropodidae has also been supported by genetic studies.

A conservative arrangement of modern and fossil taxa may be summarised as:

* family Potoroidae
** subfamily †Palaeopotoroinae
*** genus †&quot;Palaeopotorous&quot;
** subfamily Potoroinae
*** genus †&quot;Borungaboodie&quot;
*** genus †&quot;Milliyowi&quot;

**** genus &quot;Aepyprymnus&quot;
**** genus &quot;Bettongia&quot;
**** genus †&quot;Caloprymnus&quot;
*** tribe Potoroini
**** genus &quot;Potorous&quot;
** subfamily †Bulungamayinae

<text>Alford Corley is an American actor, singer, and producer. Corley is best known as the first actor to play Steven Carrington in the 1980s soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; and for his 1984 hit single &quot;Square Rooms&quot;.

==Career==
In the late 1970s, he worked as a doorman at Studio 54 to pay for his studies at the Actors Studio. He would later appear in a VH1 &quot;Behind the Music&quot; special on Studio 54 to recount his experiences.
Al Corley was the first actor to play Steven Carrington on the 1980s soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;. After that, Al Corley acted in fourteen movies, then produced five. Al Corley left &quot;Dynasty&quot; at the end of the second season in 1982 after complaining publicly in &quot;Interview&quot; that &quot;Steven doesn&#x27;t have any fun... He doesn&#x27;t laugh; he has no humor&quot;. He also lamented Steven&#x27;s &quot;ever-shifting sexual preferences&quot;, and stated that he wanted &quot;to do other things&quot;. The character was recast in 1983 with Jack Coleman; the change in appearance attributed to plastic surgery after an oil rig explosion. Coleman remained on the show until 1988, but Corley returned to the role of Steven for the 1991 miniseries &quot;&quot; when Coleman was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts. Corley later appeared in the short-lived soap opera &quot;Bare Essence&quot; in 1983, playing Genie Francis&#x27; love interest, and co-starred opposite his former &quot;Dynasty&quot; co-star Pamela Sue Martin in the film &quot;Torchlight&quot; (1985).

He was also known as a singer in the 1980s. His 1984 single &quot;Square Rooms&quot;, from his debut album of the same name became a number one hit in France (in 1985), also reaching No. 6 in Switzerland, No. 12 in Italy (in 1985), No. 13 in Germany, No. 15 in Austria and No. 80 in the U.S. The same year, he released &quot;Cold Dresses&quot;, which was also a big hit in France, reaching No. 5. His second album, &quot;Riot of Color&quot; was released in 1986, and a third album, &quot;Big Picture&quot; followed in 1988.

==Personal life==
He was married in 1989 to German actress Jessika Cardinahl. They have three children. Before his marriage, he had a brief romance with pop star Carly Simon. It was Corley (with his back to the camera) who appeared with Simon on the cover art shot for her 1981 album &quot;Torch&quot;.

He resides in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles.

==Life and career==
===1984–2000: Early life, education, and discovery===
Delta Lea Goodrem was born in Sydney on 9 November 1984, to Lea () and Denis Goodrem. She has a younger brother, Trent.

Goodrem appeared in an American advertisement aged seven for the former toy company Galoob, alongside fellow Australian Bec Hewitt, and began playing piano at the same age while taking up singing, dancing and acting lessons. She appeared in adverts for companies such as Optus and Nesquik, and had several minor roles in episodes of Australian television shows including &quot;Hey Dad..!&quot;, &quot;A Country Practice&quot;, and &quot;Police Rescue&quot;.

While residing in Glenhaven, she attended the Hills Grammar School in neighbouring Kenthurst, from kindergarten until Year 11.

At the age of thirteen, Goodrem recorded a five-song demo CD, financed through her television work. It was sent to the Australian rules football club Sydney Swans (of which Goodrem is a supporter) and they passed it onto talent manager Glenn Wheatley. Wheatley signed Goodrem to an artist development deal with independent record label, Empire Records.

Between June 1999 and September 2000, Goodrem worked with producers Paul Higgins and Trevor Carter on thirteen tracks for an album to be called &quot;Delta&quot;. A later report on these sessions described Goodrem as &quot;an ambitious 15-year-old keen to emulate the pop sound of the Spice Girls, Britney Spears and Mandy Moore.&quot; Most of the tracks were written by Carter, although Goodrem co-wrote two and self-wrote the song &quot;Love&quot;. Goodrem did a photoshoot for the album (some of the photos have surfaced), and recorded a home-made style music video for the song &quot;Say&quot; which has since leaked onto the internet. Higgins took the album to Village Roadshow, which offered to market and distribute the album, but the deal was blocked by Goodrem&#x27;s parents. The album has yet to surface, though it became the subject of a lawsuit in 2004.

===2001–2003: Career launch, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; and cancer diagnosis===

At the age of 15, Goodrem signed a recording contract with Sony Music and began work on an album of pop–dance songs including the unsuccessful debut single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, which peaked at number sixty four on the ARIA Singles Chart in November 2001. The album and proposed second single &quot;A Year Ago Today&quot; were pushed aside as a result, allowing Goodrem and Sony to re-evaluate her future musical direction. In 2002, Goodrem took up the role as shy schoolgirl and aspiring singer Nina Tucker in the popular television soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, which helped re-launch Goodrem&#x27;s music career. The piano-based ballad &quot;Born to Try&quot;, co-written by Audius Mtawarira, premiered on the show and reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and the New Zealand singles chart, and number three in the UK. &quot;Born to Try&quot; was certified triple Platinum in Australia for sales of over 210,000 copies. Goodrem&#x27;s role on the show scored her a Logie for &quot;Most Popular New Talent&quot; at the Logie Awards of 2003. In January 2003, &quot;Lost Without You&quot; topped the ARIA Singles Chart and reached number four in New Zealand and the UK. it was certified double platinum for sales over 140,000 copies in Australia.

Goodrem&#x27;s largely self-penned debut studio album, &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, was released on 24 March 2003 in Australia and debuted at number one on the ARIA Album Charts, breaking Australian records previously held by John Farnham&#x27;s &quot;Whispering Jack&quot; (1986) by staying at number one for 29 consecutive weeks, while tying with Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Hot August Night&quot; (1972) as the second-longest charting number one album with a total of 29 weeks at top spot. It was the highest-selling album in Australia of 2003 and sold 1.2 million copies in Australia, and over 4 million worldwide. The album also charted highly in the UK, peaking at number two. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; again reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and number nine in the UK. It was certified Platinum in Australia for sales over 70,000 copies.

On 8 July 2003, at the age of 18, Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system. She was forced to put all working commitments on hold while undertaking treatment for the disease. In an exclusive interview with &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, Goodrem revealed that, since 2002, she had suffered from a head-to-toe rash, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and a lump on her neck. &quot;I was doing sit-ups when I felt something pop in my neck. I reached down and I felt a small lump at the base of my throat. It wasn&#x27;t sore, it wasn&#x27;t visible, but I could feel it.&quot; As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy. The news of her diagnosis made newspaper and television headlines and an outpouring of support was shown by fans and the general public alike. Goodrem thanked them during &quot;The Visualise Tour&quot; for all the letters and well wishes she received.

The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Not Me, Not I&quot;, was released following the announcement Goodrem had been diagnosed with cancer. It became her fourth consecutive number one single in Australia, overtaking the previous effort of three number-ones from Kylie Minogue&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Kylie&quot; (1988). It was certified Platinum for sales over 70,000 copies. In early August, Goodrem announced she would not renew her contract with Glenn Wheatley. Her mother, Lea Goodrem, replaced him as her manager. Later that month, Goodrem won seven ARIA Music Awards, including &quot;Best Female Artist&quot;, surpassing Natalie Imbruglia&#x27;s previous record of six awards in 1999. As she was too unwell to perform at the ceremony herself, singer Darren Hayes performed a rendition of &quot;Lost Without You&quot; as a tribute, bringing an overwhelmed Goodrem to tears. Her first full-length DVD &quot;Delta&quot; became the highest-selling music DVD by an Australian artist in Australia ever, with a certification of 11× platinum. The Australian-only release &quot;Predictable&quot; became her fifth consecutive number one on the ARIA Singles Chart in December and was certified double Platinum for sales of over 140,000 copies.

===2004–2006: &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; and The Visualise Tour===
After announcing in late December 2003 that she was in remission, Goodrem began work on her second studio album. Goodrem received two nominations at the Logie Awards of 2004 including a Gold Logie nomination for &quot;Most Popular Personality on Australian Television&quot;.

In March 2004, while Goodrem was still undergoing cancer treatment, Paul Higgins and Trevor Carter announced plans to release the album they had recorded with the then 15-year-old Goodrem in 1999 and 2000. They shopped the album around and ignited a bidding war amongst record companies. After the success of &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, industry experts expected that bidding for the album could attract figures anywhere between $1.5 million and $15 million. When Goodrem and her family disapproved of the album&#x27;s release, a lawsuit was filed. Goodrem&#x27;s lawyers claimed the album was made up of unfinished demo recordings which were not fit for commercial release. After much coverage in the media, the case was settled in mediation. In exchange for not releasing the album, Higgins and Carter received an unspecified payout.

In September 2004, she became the face of soft drink company Pepsi in Australia, appearing on the product, billboards, TV advertisements and performing an exclusive show for competition winners. In October Goodrem launched her own lingerie line titled &quot;Delta by Annabella&quot;.

Goodrem&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, was released in Australia on 8 November 2004 and debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums chart. It was certified five times platinum for sales of 350,000 copies. The album spent 46 weeks in the top fifty. It also reached number seven in New Zealand, and peaked at number 25 in the UK. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, which was co-written and produced by Guy Chambers, was released prior to the album on 8 October 2004. &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and number nine in the UK. This was Goodrem&#x27;s sixth straight number-one single in Australia. It was certified platinum in Australia.

The second single, &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, released as a single only in Australia, debuted at number seven and was certified Gold. &quot;Almost Here&quot;, a duet with Irish singer and then boyfriend Brian McFadden of Westlife, was released as the third single and reached number three in the UK and became her seventh ARIA number one, along with her first number one in Ireland. It was certified platinum in Australia. &quot;A Little Too Late&quot; was released only in Australia and peaked at number 13. &quot;Be Strong&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fifth and final single in Australia as a digital download on 17 October 2005. At the time of release, digital downloads were not included as part of the main singles chart, therefore it was ineligible to chart. Much of the album, in particular &quot;Extraordinary Day&quot;, was inspired by her battle with cancer. Reflecting on that period of her life, Goodrem said &quot;It&#x27;s weird to see pictures of that time. In some ways the fact that I was so sick was so out there, and yet I kept it really private. No-one saw me on the days I was really sick. I was 18 when I was diagnosed and I had a number one album and single in the country. And in the UK, I was number two. It was such a bipolar year&quot;.
In March 2005, Goodrem starred in her first film role in &quot;Hating Alison Ashley&quot;, a film based on the 1984 children&#x27;s novel by Robin Klein, with Goodrem acting the title character. The film performed poorly at the box office and was not a critical success, with some critics citing Goodrem&#x27;s performance as too robotic and detached. April 2005 saw Goodrem relocate to New York to launch her career in the United States with a reworked version of &quot;Lost Without You&quot;. She appeared in the last two episodes of the short-lived American series &quot;North Shore&quot; in a bid to gain greater exposure. &quot;Lost Without You&quot; proved to be modestly successful, peaking at number eighteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart, but Goodrem was reportedly dissatisfied with its performance. Plans to release a hybrid of her first two studio albums were later terminated and Goodrem put America on hold. In July, Goodrem embarked on her first headline concert tour of Australia, The Visualise Tour. Ticket prices, $99 each, came under criticism for being higher than most international acts touring Australia at the time and this initially led to slow sales. By the time the tour took place, 80,000 tickets had been sold across the ten shows. &quot;The Visualise Tour: Live in Concert&quot; was released in November and became Goodrem&#x27;s second No. 1 DVD.

On 15 March 2006, Goodrem performed a new song, &quot;Together We Are One&quot;, at the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in front of 80,000 spectators and up to 1.5 billion television viewers worldwide. The song, written specifically for the event, was released in Australia, where it peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was performed by the Top 5 contestants on season five of &quot;American Idol&quot;. In June 2006, Goodrem signed to Modest! Entertainment for her worldwide management. In October 2006, Goodrem promoted in Japan with the release of an updated version of &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; and the Japan-only single &quot;Flawed&quot;, which reached number one on the Japanese download chart. The album peaked at number eight on the Japanese international chart (excluding Japanese artists) and number nineteen on the official Japanese album chart (including Japanese artists). In November, Goodrem appeared with Westlife on the British reality television music competition series &quot;The X Factor&quot; to perform a duet titled &quot;All Out of Love&quot;, which appeared on the boy band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Love Album&quot;. She was in Melbourne on Christmas Eve to headline the annual Carols by Candlelight.

===2007–2010: &quot;Delta&quot; and Believe Again Tour===

Goodrem&#x27;s third studio album, the eponymous &quot;Delta&quot;, was released in Australia on 20 October 2007. Goodrem described the material as &quot;...a lot lighter&quot; compared to her previous album &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;. She has also stated, &quot;As people become more aware of your life, they can pinpoint what songs are about. On this album, I&#x27;ve tried to remove a lot of that and just write great pop songs, songs that are from my heart but there&#x27;s no baggage with them&quot;.

<text>A code name, codename, call sign, or cryptonym is a code word or name used, sometimes clandestinely, to refer to another name, word, project, or person. Code names are often used for military purposes, or in espionage. They may also be used in industrial counter-espionage to protect secret projects and the like from business rivals, or to give names to projects whose marketing name has not yet been determined. Another reason for the use of names and phrases in the military is that they transmit with a lower level of cumulative errors over a walkie-talkie or radio link than actual names.

== Military origins ==

During World War I, names common to the Allies referring to nations, cities, geographical features, military units, military operations, diplomatic meetings, places, and individual persons were agreed upon, adapting pre-war naming procedures in use by the governments concerned. In the British case names were administered and controlled by the Inter Services Security Board (ISSB) staffed by the War Office. This procedure was coordinated with the United States when it entered the war. Random lists of names were issued to users in alphabetical blocks of ten words and were selected as required. Words became available for re-use after six months and unused allocations could be reassigned at discretion and according to need. Judicious selection from the available allocation could result in clever meanings and result in an aptronym or backronym, although policy was to select words that had no obviously deducible connection with what they were supposed to be concealing. Those for the major conference meetings had a partial naming sequence referring to devices or instruments which had a number as part of their meaning, e.g., the third meeting was &quot;TRIDENT&quot;. Joseph Stalin, whose last name means &quot;man of steel&quot;, was given the name &quot;GLYPTIC&quot;, meaning &quot;an image carved out of stone&quot;.

=== German code names ===
Ewen Montagu, a British Naval intelligence officer, discloses in &quot;Beyond Top Secret Ultra&quot; that during World War II, Nazi Germany habitually used &quot;ad hoc&quot; code names as nicknames which often openly revealed or strongly hinted at their content or function.

Some German code names:

* Golfplatz (German for &quot;golf course&quot;) – Britain, employed by the Abwehr
* Samland – The United States (from Uncle Sam), employed by the Abwehr
* Heimdall (a god whose power was &quot;to see for a hundred miles&quot;) – long-range radar
* Wotan – an aerial bombing navigation system. Knowing that the god Wotan had only one eye, R. V. Jones, a British scientist working for Air Intelligence of the British Air Ministry and SIS inferred that the device used a single beam and from that determined, correctly, how it must work. A counter-system was quickly created which made Wotan useless.
* Operation Seelöwe (Sea-lion) – plans to invade Britain (lions being prominent in the coat of arms of the United Kingdom)
* Operation Barbarossa (Frederick Barbarossa) – plans to go east and invade the Soviet Union

Conversely, Operation Wacht am Rhein (Watch on the Rhine) was deliberately named to suggest the opposite of its purpose a defensive &quot;watch&quot; as opposed to a massive blitzkrieg operation, just as was Operation Weserübung (Weser-exercise), which signified the plans to invade Norway and Denmark in April 1940.

=== Code names of other powers ===
Britain and the United States developed the security policy of assigning code names intended to give no such clues to the uninitiated. For example, the British counter measures against the V-2 was called &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot;. The atomic bomb project centered in New Mexico was called the Manhattan Project, derived from the Manhattan Engineer District which managed the program. The code name for the American A-12 / SR-71 spy plane project, producing the fastest, highest-flying aircraft in the world, was &quot;Oxcart&quot;. The American group that planned that country&#x27;s first ICBM was called the Teapot Committee.

Although the word could stand for a menace to shipping (in this case, that of Japan), the American code name for the attack on the subtropical island of Okinawa in World War II was &quot;Operation Iceberg&quot;. The Soviet Union&#x27;s project to base missiles in Cuba was named &quot;Operation Anadyr&quot; after their closest bomber base to the US (just across the Bering Strait from Nome, Alaska). The names of colors are generally avoided in American practice to avoid confusion with meteorological reporting practices. Britain, in contrast, made deliberately non-meaningful use of them, through the system of rainbow codes.

=== Aircraft recognition reporting names ===

Although German and Italian aircraft were not given code names by their Allied opponents, in 1942, Captain Frank T. McCoy, an intelligence officer of the USAAF, invented a system for the identification of Japanese military aircraft. Initially using short, &quot;hillbilly&quot; boys&#x27; names such as &quot;Pete&quot;, &quot;Jake&quot;, and &quot;Rufe&quot;, the system was later extended to include girls&#x27; names and names of trees and birds, and became widely used by the Allies throughout the Pacific theater of war. This type of naming scheme differs from the other use of code names in that it does not have to be kept secret, but is a means of identification where the official nomenclature is unknown or uncertain.

The policy of recognition reporting names was continued into the Cold War for Soviet, other Warsaw Pact, and Communist Chinese aircraft. Although this was started by the Air Standards Co-ordinating Committee (ASCC) formed by the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, it was extended throughout NATO as the NATO reporting name for aircraft, rockets and missiles. These names were considered by the Soviets as being like a nickname given to one&#x27;s unit by the opponents in a battle. The Soviets did not like the Sukhoi Su-25 getting the code name &quot;Frogfoot&quot;. However, some names were appropriate, such as &quot;Condor&quot; for the Antonov An-124, or, most famously, &quot;Fulcrum&quot; for the Mikoyan MiG-29, which had a &quot;pivotal&quot; role in Soviet air-strategy.

Code names were adopted by the following process. Aerial or space reconnaissance would note a new aircraft at a Warsaw Pact airbase. The intelligence units would then assign it a code name consisting of the official abbreviation of the base, then a letter, for example, &quot;Ram-A&quot;, signifying an aircraft sighted at Ramenskoye Airport. Missiles were given designations like &quot;TT-5&quot;, for the fifth rocket seen at Tyura-Tam. When more information resulted in knowing a bit about what a missile was used for, it would be given a designation like &quot;SS-6&quot;, for the sixth surface-to-surface missile design reported. Finally, when either an aircraft or a missile was able to be photographed with a hand-held camera, instead of a reconnaissance aircraft, it was given a name like &quot;Flanker&quot; or &quot;Scud&quot; always an English word, as international pilots worldwide are required to learn English. The Soviet manufacturer or designation – which may be mistakenly inferred by NATO – has nothing to do with it.

Jet-powered aircraft received two-syllable names like Foxbat, while propeller aircraft were designated with short names like Bull. Fighter names began with an &quot;F&quot;, bombers with a &quot;B&quot;, cargo aircraft with a &quot;C&quot;. Training aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft were grouped under the word &quot;miscellaneous&quot;, and received &quot;M&quot;. The same convention applies to missiles, with air-launched ground attack missiles beginning with the letter &quot;K&quot; and surface-to-surface missiles (ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to antitank rockets) with the letter &quot;S&quot;, air-to-air missiles &quot;A&quot;, and surface-to-air missiles &quot;G&quot;.

=== Military operations since Churchill ===
Throughout the Second World War, the British allocation practice favored one-word code names (Jubilee, Frankton). That of the Americans favored longer compound words, although the name Overlord was personally chosen by Winston Churchill himself. Many examples of both types can be cited, as can exceptions.

Winston Churchill was particular about the quality of code names. He insisted that code words, especially for dangerous operations, would be not overly grand nor petty nor common. One emotional goal he mentions is to never have to report to anyone that their son &quot;was killed in an operation called &#x27;Bunnyhug&#x27; or &#x27;Ballyhoo&#x27;.&quot;

Presently, British forces tend to use one-word names, presumably in keeping with their post-World War II policy of reserving single words for operations and two-word names for exercises. British operation code names are usually randomly generated by a computer and rarely reveal its components or any political implications unlike the American names (e.g., the 2003 invasion of Iraq was called &quot;Operation Telic&quot; compared to Americans&#x27; &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot;, obviously chosen for propaganda rather than secrecy). Americans prefer two-word names, whereas the Canadians and Australians use either. The French military currently prefer names drawn from nature (such as colors or the names of animals), for instance &quot;Opération Daguet&quot; (&quot;brocket deer&quot;) or &quot;Opération Baliste&quot; (&quot;Triggerfish&quot;). The CIA uses alphabetical prefixes to designate the part of the agency supporting an operation.

In many cases with the United States, the first word of the name has to do with the intent of the program. Programs with &quot;have&quot; as the first word, such as Have Blue for the stealth fighter development, are developmental programs, not meant to produce a production aircraft. Programs that start with Senior, such as Senior Trend for the F-117, are for aircraft in testing meant to enter production.

In the United States code names are commonly set entirely in upper case.&lt;ref name=&quot;maryferrell/cryptdb&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is not done in other countries, though for the UK in British documents the code name is in upper case while operation is shortened to OP e.g., &quot;Op. TELIC&quot;.

This presents an opportunity for a bit of public-relations (Operation Just Cause), or for controversy over the naming choice (Operation Infinite Justice, renamed Operation Enduring Freedom). Computers are now used to aid in the selection. And further, there is a distinction between the &quot;secret&quot; names during former wars and the &quot;published&quot; names of recent ones.

== Project code name ==
A project code name is a code name (usually a single word, short phrase or acronym) which is given to a project being developed by industry, academia, government, and other concerns.

Project code names are typically used for several reasons:

* To uniquely identify the project within the organization. Code names are frequently chosen to be outside the normal business/domain jargon that the organization uses, in order to not conflict with established terminology.
* To assist with maintaining secrecy of the project against rival concerns. Some corporations routinely change project names in order to further confuse competitors.
* When the goal of the project is to develop one or more commercial &quot;products&quot;, use of a code name allows the eventual choice of product nomenclature (the name the product(s) are marketed and sold under) to be decoupled from the development effort. This is especially important when one project generates multiple products, or multiple projects are needed to produce a single product. This allows for &quot;subprojects&quot; to be given a separate identity from the main project.
* To decouple an early phase of a development effort (which may have failed) from a subsequent phase (which may be given a &quot;fresh start&quot;) as a political tool.
* To prevent casual observers from concluding that a pre-release version is a new release of the product, thus helping reduce confusion.

Different organizations have different policies regarding the use and publication of project code names. Some companies take great pains to &quot;never&quot; discuss or disclose project code names outside of the company (other than with outside entities who have a need to know, and typically are bound with a non-disclosure agreement). Other companies never use them in official or formal communications, but widely disseminate project code names through informal channels (often in an attempt to create a marketing buzz for the project). Still others (such as Microsoft) discuss code names publicly, and routinely use project code names on beta releases and such, but remove them from final product(s). In the case of Windows 95, the code name &quot;CHICAGO&quot; was left embedded in the INF File structure and remained required through Windows Me. At the other end of the spectrum, Apple includes the project code names for Mac OS X as part of the official name of the final product, a practice that was started in 2002 with Mac OS X v10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot;. Google and the AOSP also used this for their Android operating system until 2013, where the code name was different from the release name.

* AMD have also been naming their CPUs since 90 nm generations under the K8 micro-architecture after the name of cities around the world. For the CPUs under the Phenom brand, the names of stars were used as code names. For Opteron server CPUs and platforms, cities related to the Ferrari Formula One team were used. Mobile platforms are named after birds (except for Puma). For example:
** Single-core Athlon 64 and Athlon 64 FX : Newcastle, Venice, San Diego and Lima
** Dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon 64 FX: Manchester, Toledo, Windsor and Brisbane
** Phenom CPUs: Agena (Beta Centauri), Toliman (Alpha Centauri), Kuma (Nu Draconis), Deneb (Alpha Cygni), Propus (Eta Geminorum), Heka (Lambda Orionis), Rana (Delta Eridani), Regor (Gamma Velorum)
** Opteron CPUs: Barcelona, Shanghai, São Paulo, Istanbul
** Server platforms: Catalunya, Fiorano, Maranello
** Mobile CPUs: Griffin, Lion, Swift
** Mobile platforms: Kite, Puma, Shrike, Eagle
* Apple currently names the major releases of macOS (previously known as Mac OS X) after major California landmarks, such as Mavericks (10.9), Yosemite (10.10), El Capitan (10.11), Sierra (10.12 ), High Sierra (10.13) Mojave (10.14), Catalina (10.15), Big Sur (11.0), Monterey (12.0), Ventura (13.0), and Sonoma (14.0). Previous releases were named after big cats: Cheetah (10.0), Puma (10.1), Jaguar (10.2), Panther (10.3), Tiger (10.4), Leopard (10.5), Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7), and Mountain Lion (10.8). Other former code names include:
** Composers, such as Copland, after composer Aaron Copland; and Gershwin, after George Gershwin. 
** Women&#x27;s names, e.g. Jennifer (rumored for the Macintosh IIx), and Lisa. 
** Varieties of apples, including Cortland for the Apple IIGS, and Macintosh (from McIntosh). 
** Carl Sagan, which was used for the Power Macintosh 7100 while it was under development. In 1994 astronomer Carl Sagan filed two lawsuits against Apple related to that usage, and lost both, reaching an out-of-court settlement with the company.
* Intel often names CPU projects after rivers in the American West, particularly in the state of Oregon (where most of Intel&#x27;s CPU projects are designed). Examples include Willamette, Deschutes, Yamhill, Tualatin, and Clackamas. See List of Intel codenames.
* Microsoft often names projects (in particular, versions of the Microsoft Windows operating systems) after place names. Examples include Chicago (Windows 95), Daytona (Windows NT 3.5), Memphis (Windows 98), Whistler (Windows XP) and Longhorn (Windows Vista).
* For a period of time, Mozilla used code names which are mostly named after national parks to reference different versions of the Mozilla Firefox browser:

** Firefox 3.0: Gran Paradiso
** Firefox 3.5: Shiretoko
** Firefox 3.6: Namoroka
** Firefox 4.0: Tumucumaque
** Firefox pre-beta: Aurora
** Firefox trunk builds: Nightly
* Nintendo often uses code names for new consoles. The best-known is that of Wii, which was code-named Revolution for over a year. Others include the GameCube&#x27;s code name of Dolphin, the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s code name of Atlantis, the Nintendo 64 as Project Reality, the DS code name Project Nitro, the Game Boy Micro code name Oxygen, the Wii U code name Project Cafe, and Nintendo&#x27;s latest console Switch as NX.
* &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was code-named &quot;Blue Harvest&quot; while in production and principal photography. This was reportedly to prevent disruption by fans and the media as well as to avoid price gouging by local merchants and vendors.
* &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot; sequel of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series was code-named &quot;Incident of 57th Street&quot; to disguise the production from its increasingly rabid fanbase, who would seek out filming locations and disrupt production.
