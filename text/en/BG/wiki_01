<text>Balclutha () is a town in South Otago, lying towards the end of the Clutha River, on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is about halfway between Dunedin and Gore on the Main South Line railway, State Highway 1 and the Southern Scenic Route. Balclutha has a population of (as of ), and is the largest town in South Otago.

The Clutha District Council is based in Balclutha.

The major service centre for the fertile farming region around the lower reaches of the Clutha River, it is also the nearest large town to the Catlins, a scenic region of native forest, wildlife, and rugged coastline.

==History==

Known locally as &quot;Clutha&quot;, Balclutha&#x27;s name – and that of the river on which it stands – reflects the Scottish origin of the town&#x27;s settlement. The name comes from Scottish Gaelic Baile Chluaidh (literally &quot;Clyde Town&quot;, a poetic name for Dumbarton).

James McNeil from Bonhill, Dumbartonshire, Scotland, who is regarded as the town&#x27;s founding father, arrived in 1853, via Port Chalmers in 1849. His farm was on the site of the present town, where he and the Provincial Government established a ferry service across the Clutha in 1857; as a result the town was initially called Clutha Ferry.

The Māori name for the area is Iwikatea, literally &quot;Bleached bones&quot; (a local Māori tribal battle in 1750 left the decomposing bodies of the defeated, their bones whitened in the sun).

== Demographics ==
Balclutha covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Balclutha had a population of 4,110 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 123 people (3.1%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 27 people (−0.7%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,725 households, comprising 2,013 males and 2,100 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.96 males per female, with 678 people (16.5%) aged under 15 years, 741 (18.0%) aged 15 to 29, 1,734 (42.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 960 (23.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 86.7% European/Pākehā, 11.5% Māori, 3.4% Pasifika, 5.0% Asian, and 1.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 12.6, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 52.1% had no religion, 36.3% were Christian, 0.3% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.7% were Hindu, 1.1% were Muslim, 0.6% were Buddhist and 1.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 339 (9.9%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 1,047 (30.5%) people had no formal qualifications. 354 people (10.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,710 (49.8%) people were employed full-time, 447 (13.0%) were part-time, and 96 (2.8%) were unemployed.

==Landmarks==
The Clutha River flows through the town. It is the largest river in New Zealand by volume of water, and the country&#x27;s second longest after the Waikato. It provides the town with various recreational facilities, including fishing (brown trout), water skiing and power boating. Immediately to the south of the town it splits into two distributaries, the Matau and the Koau, the latter of which skirts the southern edge of the town.
The most prominent structure in the town is the concrete Balclutha Road Bridge across the Clutha, which was built in 1935. The original 1868 wooden bridge was washed away on 14 October 1878. Rebuilt in 1881, it was later considered unsuitable for motor vehicles.

The South Island Main Trunk Railway crosses the river some 800 metres downstream, near the junction where the Clutha River divides into the southern branch, known as the Kaoru (pied shag), and the northern the Matau (derived from Mata Au, the Maori name for the Clutha).

Most of Balclutha township lies on &#x27;the flat&#x27; land which lies within a wide loop in the river to the south of the road bridge, but North Balclutha is on the hill to the north of the bridge and Rosebank on the hill to the south.

There are several natural features in and near Balclutha. Nearby at Benhar / Kaitangata is Lake Tuakitoto, and Matai Falls, a natural waterfall and scenic feature is in the Catlins. The yellow-eyed penguin comes ashore for breeding in the Balclutha area at the edge of the Catlins, and The Nuggets are located at nearby Kaka Point.

<doc id="307637" wikidata="Q218768" url="?curid=307637" title="Rabaul">
<text>Rabaul () is a township in the East New Britain province of Papua New Guinea, on the island of New Britain. It lies about 600 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash from a volcanic eruption in its harbor. During the eruption, ash was sent thousands of metres into the air, and the subsequent rain of ash caused 80% of the buildings in Rabaul to collapse. After the eruption the capital was moved to Kokopo, about away. Rabaul is continually threatened by volcanic activity, because it is on the edge of the Rabaul caldera, a flooded caldera of a large pyroclastic shield volcano.

Rabaul was planned and built around the harbour area known as Simpsonhafen (Simpson Harbour) during the German New Guinea administration, which controlled the region from 1884 and formally through 1919. Rabaul was selected as the capital of the German New Guinea administration in 1905, and the administrative offices were transferred there in 1910. Rabaul was captured by the British Empire during the early days of World War I. It became the capital of the Australian-mandated Territory of New Guinea until 1937, when it was first destroyed by a volcano. During World War II, it was captured by Japan in 1942 and became its main base of military and naval activity in the South Pacific. Settlements and military installations around the edge of the caldera are often collectively called &quot;Rabaul&quot;, although the old town of Rabaul was reduced to practical insignificance by the volcanic eruption in 1937.

As a tourist destination, Rabaul is popular for its volcanoes, scuba diving and for snorkelling sites, spectacular harbour and other scenery, World War II history, flora and fauna, and the cultural life of the Tolai people. Before the 1994 eruption, Rabaul was a popular commercial and recreational boating destination; fewer private small craft visit now, but 10 to 12 cruise ships visit Rabaul each year, including the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, carrying up to 2,000 passengers. Tourism is a major industry in Rabaul and East New Britain generally.

==History==
Rabaul&#x27;s proximity to its volcanoes has always been a source of concern. It could be the source of the 1808 mystery eruption. In 1878, before it was established as a town, an eruption formed a volcano in the harbour.

For other eruptions, see Rabaul caldera.

===Colonial period and aftermath===


In 1910 the German colonial government during the administration of Governor Albert Hahl moved offices, the district court, a hospital and customs and postal facilities from &quot;Herbertshöhe&quot; (today&#x27;s Kokopo) to &quot;Simpsonhafen&quot;. That settlement was thus substantially enlarged with official buildings and housing and renamed &quot;Rabaul&quot;, meaning mangrove in Kuanua (the local language) as the new town was partially built on a reclaimed mangrove swamp.

At the outset of World War I, at the behest of Great Britain, Australia – as one of the Dominions of the British Empire – defeated the German military garrison in Rabaul and occupied the territory with the volunteer Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat at the end of the war, the occupied territory was delegated in 1920 to Australia as a League of Nations Mandate (Class C). Rabaul became the capital of the Territory of New Guinea. Visits to and stays in Rabaul during this period were amply described in books by many authors, including Margaret Mead.

Gunantambu, the famous house of &quot;Queen&quot; Emma Forsayth and her husband, contained furniture previously owned by Robert Louis Stevenson and left to her family in Samoa. Destroyed in the 1937 volcano eruption, its remains became a tourist attraction after World War II and remained so until the 1994 further volcanic destruction of Rabaul.

In 1929, Rabaul was the site of the Rabaul Strike, the first industrial strike in Papua New Guinea.

===Rabaul (Tavurvur) volcano: 6 June 1937 eruption===

&quot;Rabaul volcano is one of the most active and most dangerous volcanoes in Papua New Guinea,&quot; according to the website Volcano Discovery, which notes that, after an earlier eruption entirely destroyed Rabaul on 6 June 1937, &quot;Rabaul exploded violently [again] in 1994 and devastated the...[city]. Since then, the young cone Tavurvur located inside the caldera has been the site of near persistent activity in form of strombolian to vulcanian ash eruptions. The caldera has an elliptical form (14 × 9 km) and is surrounded by a steep volcanic ridge several hundred meters high.&quot;

Under the Australian administration, Rabaul developed into a regional base. Then in 1937, catastrophic volcanic eruptions destroyed the town after the two volcanoes, Tavurvur and Vulcan, exploded and killed 507 people, as well as causing widespread damage. Following this, the Australian administration for the Territory of New Guinea decided to move the territorial headquarters to the safer location of Lae. All long-term steps to re-establish the territorial headquarters at Rabaul were forestalled during World War II.

===World War II===

Rabaul was heavily bombed by Japanese aircraft starting from 4 January 1942. On 23 January the battle of Rabaul began and Rabaul was captured shortly thereafter by thousands of Japanese naval landing forces. Rabaul was then bombed by Allied forces later that month.

The military personnel, and most civilians who had remained in Rabaul, were placed aboard the &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;, which was sunk off the Philippines in June 1942. About six planters who had remained in the bush were executed in July 1942 after they gave themselves up to the Japanese, while 12 men, who had technical skills, were imprisoned in Rabaul, but were executed at the end of 1944. Four men were found in a camp when Rabaul was liberated.

During their occupation the Japanese developed Rabaul into a much more powerful base than the Australians had planned after the 1937 volcanic eruptions, with long-term consequences for the town in the post-war period. The Japanese army dug many kilometres of tunnels as shelter from Allied air attacks, such as the bombing of November 1943. They also expanded the facilities by constructing army barracks and support structures. By 1943 there were about 110,000 Japanese troops based in Rabaul.

On 18 April 1943, the United States executed Operation Vengeance, in which Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the architect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was shot down and killed by a United States P-38 Lightning over south Bougainville. Yamamoto had taken off from Rabaul on an inspection tour, and United States Navy cryptographers had intercepted and then decrypted Japanese communications giving his flight itinerary. Because of the need to keep secret the American ability to decrypt Japanese radio traffic, the sensitive information went up the chain of command for a decision as to what actions the units in the field should take; ultimately President Franklin D. Roosevelt was said to have approved the action based on these intercepts, although this is not documented. Sixteen United States Army Air Forces P-38 Lightning fighters took off from Guadalcanal and intercepted and shot down the two bombers of the Yamamoto flight, for the loss of one P-38.

Instead of capturing Rabaul during their advance towards the Japanese Home islands, the Allied forces decided to bypass it by establishing a ring of airfields and naval bases on the islands around it. Cut off from re-supply and under continual air attacks as part of Operation Cartwheel, the base became useless. The neutralization of Rabaul took until the end of the war and was only completed with the Japanese surrender in August 1945.

===Post–World War II until 1994===
After the Second World War, western New Guinea (renamed Papua) was returned to pre-war owner the Netherlands, and eastern New Guinea was returned to pre-war administrator Australia, and Rabaul flourished as the principal city and port of the archipelago, with one of the finest harbours in the world. By 1990 Rabaul&#x27;s population was 17,044. However, Rabaul did not resume its pre-1937 role as capital, which was taken over by Port Moresby for the entirety of the two territories.

Rabaul&#x27;s magnificent harbour and central position meant it became a trading hub for the lively, and politically and economically developing New Guinea Islands region (East and West New Britain, New Ireland, Manus Island, and Bougainville). It retained that role when Papua New Guinea became independent from Australia in 1975.

===1994 eruption===

In 1983 and 1984 the town was ready for evacuation when the volcanoes started to heat up. Nothing happened until 19 September 1994, when again Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted, destroying the airport and covering most of the town with heavy ashfall. There were only 19 hours of warning, but the city and most nearby villages were evacuated before the eruption. Five people were killed—one of them by lightning from the eruptive column. The planning and evacuation drills helped keep the death toll low. Most of the buildings in the south-eastern half of Rabaul collapsed due to the weight of ash on their roofs.

The last eruption and continuing low and modest levels of activity prompted moving the provincial capital to Kokopo, the former German &quot;Herbertshöhe&quot;. Nonetheless, Rabaul is slowly rebuilding inside the danger zone. Vulcan has remained quiet since 1994, but small and large eruptions from nearby Tavurvur occur intermittently, with the most recent of note being on 29 August 2014. A government volcanological observatory was established on the northern ridge of the Rabaul caldera in the 1950s. A team there maintains its crucial watch over the town and the volcanoes until today. They are also responsible for monitoring other volcanoes on New Britain and nearby islands.

== Transport ==
Rabaul Airport was destroyed in the 1994 eruption, and, since the approach involved flying over the Tavurvur crater, it was abandoned. The airport was in the direct path of the falling ash from the nearby vents. A new airport was built at Tokua, about 50 km farther away to the southeast. However, even it has been closed occasionally by ash thrown up by Tavurvur and driven by the northwest monsoon winds.

Rabaul has a large, nearly enclosed harbour, Simpson Harbour. Use of this harbour by the Imperial Japanese Navy was one of the motivations for the Japanese invasion in 1942.

== Climate ==
Rabaul features a tropical rainforest climate, which is constantly hot, humid, overcast and oppressive. Rabaul experiences significant rainfall year-round, and is classified as Af by Köppen and Geiger. The average annual temperature in Rabaul is 26.9 °C and rainfall there averages 2201 mm.

<doc id="307641" wikidata="Q3916534" url="?curid=307641" title="Eagle County Regional Airport">
<text>Eagle County Regional Airport is a public airport in Gypsum, Colorado, United States. The airport is also sometimes advertised as the Vail/Eagle Airport by airlines and other entities as it is located from Eagle and from Vail. It covers and has one runway. It is primary commercial airport for the Vail and Beaver Creek ski resorts, and as a result service is highly seasonal, with more flights in the winter than the rest of the year. 

The airport is also popular with private aviation destination and hosts fixed-base operators and private jet charter operators.

==Terminal and facilities==
EGE&#x27;s terminal has one concourse with five gates, built in 1996 and remodeled in 2001, 2007, and 2019. There are four TSA screening lanes, a pre-security concession/gift shop, and three luggage carousels, in addition to a special ski/snowboard slide. In 2012, a new inline baggage handling system was constructed in time for the 2012/13 ski season. Beyond the security checkpoint are a restaurant, coffee shop, gift shop, and bar. The airport also offers free wifi in the terminal. The airport has customs facilities for private aircraft located at the Vail Valley Jet Center.

The facility is in the midst of a terminal expansion project. On July 1, 2019, the first phase of this project opened, with access to the new terminal with four gates with jet bridges, enhanced concessions, and other new aviation technology. The final two ground-loading gates were expected to open in time for the 2019/2020 winter season. As of December 2019, the new TSA checkpoint is open, serving both TSA PreCheck and normal security lines.

==Operations==
The Eagle County Sheriff provides airport security response. The airport has its own ARFF department with three fire trucks, including two state-of-the-art Oshkosh Striker trucks. The airport has a full complement of snowplows, snow blowers, and powered brooms for snow removal operations, along with a complete runway friction measuring system. The tower is staffed by SERCO contract air traffic controllers. In 2019, a dedicated de-icing pad was built on the South-East section of the airfield. This allows planes to be de-iced without blocking the commercial ramp and gates.

The airport’s long runway, measuring approximately 9,000 feet, is specifically designed to accommodate landings in challenging conditions. This length allows larger aircraft to land safely, even in reduced visibility or adverse weather. Combined with modern navigation aids and the expertise of air traffic controllers, Eagle County Regional Airport ensures reliable service, making it a vital gateway for travelers heading to nearby ski resorts like Vail and Beaver Creek.

==Aircraft procedures==
There is no standard published ILS approach at the airport, but there is a special ILS approach, mostly used by the airlines, which requires permission and training from the FSDO. General aviation aircraft usually use the LDA approach, DME, or under VFR. The airport also has an on-site Beacon Interrogator (BI-6) Radar facility. IFR clearances are given by the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC).

The History Channel rated Eagle County Regional Airport as #8 on its list of Most Extreme Airports in July 2010 due to the elevation, weather, approach through mountainous terrain and challenging departure procedures. 

In 2008–09 the airport completed a runway repaving and extension project, increasing the runway length to 9,000 feet.

==Airline operations==
United flies year-round to Denver on United Express (Skywest Airlines), and nonstop to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare in the summer and winter months. American offers near year-round service to Dallas/Fort Worth, operating as American Airlines or American Eagle in every season except fall. In winter, American, Delta, and United Airlines offer service to 11 more cities across the United States including daily flights to Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami, New York–JFK, Newark, Houston–Intercontinental, and San Francisco, select Saturday flights to New York–LaGuardia and Philadelphia, and select holiday flights to Phoenix and Salt Lake City. On July 9, 2024, Alaska Airlines announced that it would commence nonstop service to Seattle/Tacoma and San Diego that December. Of the regional ski resort airports—excluding Denver and Salt Lake City—Eagle County Regional Airport has the second most regular flights during the winter, behind Aspen, CO, and ahead of Jackson Hole, WY.

Winter airline flights are operated via a variety of jet aircraft including the Boeing 757, Airbus A319 and Boeing 737 as well as Embraer 175 and Bombardier CRJ700 regional jets on shorter flights.

==Ground transportation==
Eagle County Airport has several ground transportation options available for commuting to and from the airport. These include private car service providers, shared airport shuttle operators, taxi cabs, and rideshare services. Several car rental companies also operate at the airport.

==Airlines and destinations==
 

==Early history==
Louise Ellen Cooley bought a plot of land in 1911 that served as the foundation for building what would become Eagle County Regional Airport. The area became an attraction to local residents as barnstormers used the strip to perform aerial tricks and maneuvers.

Harry A. Nottingham (Eagle County Commissioner) was eager to see a fully functional airport for Eagle County. New plans for the airstrip were laid out in 1939 by an engineer from Denver&#x27;s Airport District Office. Mr. Nottingham borrowed $20.00 for the development of a gravel road which would connect the air strip to the towns of Eagle and Gypsum 
Eagle County Airport was officially dedicated for service as a fully functioning airport on September 14, 1947.

===Past air service===
During the mid- and late 1970s, only one airline scheduled passenger service into the airport: Rocky Mountain Airways, which flew STOL capable de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters followed by larger, 50-seat STOL capable de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7s nonstop from Denver Stapleton Airport and Aspen. In the late 1970s through the mid-1980s, Rocky Mountain Airways nonstops to Denver were all flown with the larger Dash 7. The April 1, 1987, Official Airline Guide (OAG) listed three airlines serving the airport: Rocky Mountain Airways operating as Continental Express for Continental Airlines via a code sharing agreement with Dash 7 flights from Denver, Royal West Airlines operating nonstop British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jets from Los Angeles (LAX) on Saturdays, and commuter air carrier Monarch Airlines operating Twin Otters from Aspen, Crested Butte, Grand Junction and Telluride. In August 1985 runway 8 at the airport was 5000 ft in length by 60 ft in width with its west end located at ; by December 1987, runway 7 had been added on its present alignment, 7000 ft by 100 ft, with its LDA approach which then permitted operations with larger mainline jet aircraft.

The airport was being served by mainline jets in early 1994: American Airlines Boeing 757-200s nonstop from Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth, Miami, and New York La Guardia Airport, Delta Air Lines Boeing 727-200s from Salt Lake City, Northwest Airlines Boeing 757-200s from Minneapolis/St. Paul, and United Airlines Boeing 737-300s from Denver. The OAG lists 36 jet flights a week operated by these four airlines into the airport early in 1994. Air Canada began flying an Airbus A319 nonstop from Toronto Pearson in 2013 by pre-clearing passengers in Toronto since the airport does not have custom facilities. Air Canada dropped the route after the 2017/2018 winter ski season due to relocating its A319s to other U.S. destinations.

==Accidents at or near EGE==
On March 27, 1987, a Learjet 24 operated by Connie Kalitta Services impacted terrain 4.7 miles NW of EGE due to descending below the specified approach altitude. All three occupants (two pilots, one passenger) were killed.

== In popular culture ==
Eagle Vail Airport was featured on the History Channel&#x27;s special, &quot;Most Extreme Airports&quot;, as the world&#x27;s 8th most extreme airport.

<text>Riverton, officially Riverton / Aparima, is a small New Zealand town west of Invercargill, on the south-eastern shorelines of the Jacobs River Estuary. The estuary is formed by the Aparima and Pourakino rivers, leading through a narrow outflow channel into Foveaux Strait. Accessible via on the Southern Scenic Route, the main part of the town is on flat land (the Southland Plains) and the northern end of Oreti Beach. South Riverton is built on the hills (the Longwood Range) between the eastern shore of the estuary and Taramea Bay.

Riverton is the oldest permanent settlement of Southland and one of New Zealand&#x27;s oldest towns. In 2011 Riverton residents celebrated the town&#x27;s 175th anniversary.

The main industry is fishing. Farming (especially dairying) has become more important economically as the fishing industry has been less productive due to competition. Support services such as transport, irrigation, engineering and various farm related contractors now play an important part in the local economy. The fish factory based on its main wharf has been converted to a butchery. The harbour is still quite busy, because, along with Bluff, it is a safe harbour for access to New Zealand&#x27;s south-western seas. It is also popular for water skiing, rowing, fishing and catching the occasional flounder.

Taramea Bay is a popular spot in the summer for Southland residents, as it provides safe swimming and excellent surf spots. Riverton is well known for dolphin spotting, as dolphin like to travel up into the estuary for feeding. The lumber industry developed in Riverton and sawmills processed the harvest; Pankhurst&#x27;s Mill still supplies timber locally and to wider Southland.
==History==
This area was known to the Māori as Aparima, named for the Kāti Māmoe mother of Hekeia, for whom the Longwood Range is named.

Anglo-Europeans who settled the area in the 1830s called the settlement Jacob&#x27;s River. The name Riverton was later adopted by the residents, and their choice was ratified officially in March 1858. One hundred and forty years later, with the passing of Section 450 Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the town was given the dual names of Riverton / Aparima.

On the grassed plateau above the estuary channel stands a stone memorial to the founder of Riverton, whaler and runholder, Captain John Howell, who, while in the employ of Johnny Jones, was dispatched with three ships to establish a whaling station at Aparima in either 1835 or 1836 to replace the abandoned station at Preservation Inlet. The settlement became known as Jacob&#x27;s River due to a local Māori living at the mouth whom the whalers called Jacob. Jones&#x27;s purchase of all that land from Colac Bay to the New River, and extending some fifty miles inland from the Ngāi Tahu chief &quot;Bloody Jack&quot; Tūhawaiki was formally acknowledged in October 1838. At about the same time Howell secured the Pākehā tenure to the area by marrying Kohi-Kohi, the daughter of Patu and Pipikihau, the local Kāti Māmoe chief based at Raratoka Island or Centre Island in the Foveaux Strait.

The year 1850 is generally taken as the one in which settlers at Riverton definitely changed over from ploughing the sea to ploughing the land. By that time whaling along the Southland coasts gave only a precarious living and the settlers of Riverton saw they would either have to take to the land or move to a more favourable locality. The settlers had their plots of land and as much stock as they could afford. This however immediately raised the question as to who really owned the land. As long as the whalers confined themselves along the Jacobs River estuary, it was not thought worthwhile to challenge their right to the small area they occupied. With the intricate system of land ownership among the Māori, Captain Howell realised that he was not really the sole owner of those vast tracts of land which he believed were handed over to him at the time of his marriage to Kohi-Kohi. The central government sent Mr W.B.D. Mantell to negotiate with the southern Māori for the purchase of the area known as Murihiku. Walter Baldock Durrant Mantell arrived at Riverton on 27 December 1851, and began negotiations with the various chiefs of Southland. It was not until 17 August 1853 that the area of Murihiku (which encompassed Southland), was purchased from the Māori. The township was surveyed by the New Zealand Government in 1861.

===Communication===

From 1863 to 1879 a coach service from the town gave the inhabitants another source of communication with the outside world. Previously the mail had been carried by a Russian Finn, William Flint who carried the mail by foot from Invercargill. The coach-route followed the Oreti Beach to the Oreti ferry and then to Invercargill. Because of the changing nature of the quick-sands at the mouth of the Waimatuku Stream where many lives had been lost, there was jubilation with the advent of the railway to Riverton.

On 9 June 1879, a branch railway from Invercargill to Riverton was opened by the mayor Theophilus Daniel. Over the course of the next four decades further extensions were made as far as Orawia. The line became known as the Tuatapere Branch. The original railway (that eventually reached Tuatapere in 1909) crossed the estuary at Riverton using the bridge opened in 1875, the towns inhabitants sharing a road-rail bridge for twenty-six years. With the construction (1902–1905) of a combination of two Howe truss bridges and a causeway the Tuatapere Branch railway had a crossing of its own over the Jacobs River Estuary. The main bridge on the south end consisted of seventeen built beams of 9.2 metres and two Howe trusses of 18.3 metres span, giving a hybrid form of design. The supporting piers were of braced timber piles. This bridge provided a good illustration of the timber technology of the period, with its three elements of truss, built beam and piled piers (one truss can still be viewed behind the museum &quot;Te Hikoi&quot;). On 30 July 1976, it was truncated from Tuatapere back to Riverton and became known as the Riverton Branch. The railway bridges and causeway being removed in 2001.

===Historic Buildings===

Five buildings in Riverton are listed with the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga:
* Howell&#x27;s Cottage or Kohi Kohi Cottage on Napier Street dates back to 1837 or 1838. It may have been the first house built in Riverton, and is one of the few New Zealand colonial buildings pre-dating 1840.
* Daniel House on Palmerston Street is an example of a vernacular timber Georgian influenced, English-Colonial style residence.
* Palmerston Street Cottages on Palmerston Street represents mid to late nineteenth century box cottages.
* The former Riverton Court House on Palmerston Street was built in 1883 and typifies nineteenth century public works architecture. It is now incorporated into Te Hikoi, the Riverton Tourist and Heritage Centre.
* Saint Mary&#x27;s Anglican on Palmerston Street was designed by prominent Invercargill architect Edmund Richardson Fitz Wilson. It is an Anglican parish church in Carpenter Gothic style.

<doc id="307648" wikidata="Q756777" url="?curid=307648" title="Asity">
<text>The asities are a family of birds, Philepittidae, that are endemic to Madagascar. The asities consist of four species in two genera. The &quot;Neodrepanis&quot; species are known as sunbird-asities and were formerly known as false sunbirds.

&quot;Philepitta&quot; is now the type-genus of a new bird family, the Philepittidae, into which the asities of Madagascar have been placed.

==Description==
Asities are small forest birds with sexually dichromic plumage and brightly coloured wattles around the eyes of the males. These wattles, which are most conspicuous during the breeding season, get their colour from arrays of collagen fibres. This method of pigmentation is unique in the animal kingdom. Several other features separate them from the broadbills, they possess twelve tail feathers on extremely short (almost non-existent in the &quot;Philepitta&quot; species) tails, their syrinx is encased with a large bronchial ring and they have forked tongues adapted to nectivory. They have a long outer primary which buzzes in flight, possibly used in signalling during courtship. The two genera are quite distinct.

==Behavior and ecology==

===Diet and feeding===
The major component of the diet of asities is fruit. A wide range of different fruit is taken by the family, and they are among the most important avian dispersers of seeds, as there are very few other frugivorous birds in the forests of Madagascar. They will also take insects. The &quot;Neodrepanis&quot; sunbird-asities will take nectar, but do so with a long tongue rather than inserting their curved bills far into flowers.

===Breeding===
Rainforest asities breed during the Malagasy rainy season, beginning just before the rains in September to November. The velvet asity begins breeding slightly sooner in the north of its range. That species is the only one for which detailed information about breeding is available. It has a polygynous breeding system, with males holding small territories or leks where they display to passing females. Nest building, incubation, and raising the young is done solely by the females. There are reports of male yellow-bellied sunbird-asities feeding young in the nest and recently fledged chicks, so there is clearly some variation in breeding strategies in the family. The nests of the family are elaborate; pear-shaped woven structures hanging from branches, similar to those of broadbills, although uniquely amongst birds which weave nests the entrance to the nest is created by pushing through the wall after constructed (instead of the usual scenario where the entrance is weaved into the fabric of the nest).

==Status and conservation==
One species, the yellow-bellied sunbird-asity, is listed as vulnerable by BirdLife International and the IUCN. It was once considered to be an endangered species, and even possibly extinct; however this was due to a lack of ornithological surveys in its high-altitude range. Subsequent research has found it to be more abundant than previously suspected, although it is still considered threatened due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Schlegel&#x27;s asity is considered near threatened; it has a highly fragmented distribution but numerous strongholds in inaccessible ravines.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
They were thought to have been related to the pittas, hence the scientific name of the family, but a 1993 study suggested that they are actually just a subfamily of Eurylaimidae. The morphology of the syrinx is very similar to the Grauer&#x27;s broadbill of Africa. Here they are considered traditionally as a separate family. Some authors have placed the sapayoa of South America in the family, although it is now considered by many to be in its own family, the Sapayoidae.

<doc id="307649" wikidata="Q570446" url="?curid=307649" title="Sic semper tyrannis">
<text>Sic semper tyrannis is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;thus always to tyrants&quot;. In contemporary parlance, it means tyrannical leaders will inevitably be overthrown. The phrase also suggests that bad but justified outcomes should, or eventually will, befall tyrants.
It is the state motto of the U.S. state of Virginia.

==History==

Before 509 BC, Rome was ruled by kings. The last was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. The king&#x27;s son, Sextus Tarquinius, raped a noblewoman, Lucretia, who revealed the offense to various Roman noblemen and then died by suicide. The noblemen obtained the support of the aristocracy and the people to expel the king and his family and to institute the Roman Republic. The leader of the noblemen was Lucius Junius Brutus, who became one of the first consuls of the Republic. It has been suggested that the phrase was used at this event, but the suggestion is not based on any Latin surviving literature of the time.

Senator Marcus Junius Brutus, a descendant of Lucius Junius Brutus and who also took part in the assassination of Julius Caesar on 15 March 44 BC, is sometimes credited with originating the phrase. Plutarch suggests he either did not have a chance to say anything, or if he did, no one heard it:Caesar thus done to death, the senators, although Brutus came forward as if to say something about what had been done, would not wait to hear him, but burst out of doors and fled, thus filling the people with confusion and helpless fear.Mike Fontaine, professor of Classics at Cornell University, proposes that the expression is likely a Latin translation by the U.S. founding father George Wythe of what Tiberius Gracchus’ brother-in-law, the general and statesman Scipio Aemilianus, said when he heard of the assassination of Gracchus. This is also reported by Plutarch in his &quot;Life of Gracchus&quot; (21.4), where he reacted by quoting Homer’s Odyssey (1.47): ὡς ἀπόλοιτο καὶ ἄλλος, ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι. Gracchus was assassinated due to the land reforms he had made a major priority, to which Aemilianus was opposed.

The phrase has been invoked as an epithet about one allegedly abusing power, or as a rallying cry against abuse of power.

==Usage in the United States==
The phrase was recommended by George Mason to the Virginia Convention in 1776, as part of the commonwealth&#x27;s seal. The Seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia shows Virtue, spear in hand, with her foot on the recumbent form of Tyranny, whose crown lies nearby. The Seal was planned by Mason and designed by George Wythe, who signed the United States Declaration of Independence and taught law to Thomas Jefferson. A joke referencing the image on the seal that dates as far back as the Civil War, is that &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot; actually means &quot;Get your foot off my neck.&quot;

&quot;Happy While United&quot; was the slogan on a medal coined by the State of Virginia in 1780. First envisioned by Thomas Jefferson, the medal was minted and designed to be given to Indian signatories to the treaties Jefferson planned with the Indians of Virginia. The medal portrays a Virginia colonial, sitting, enjoying a peace pipe with a Native American. The obverse portrays a variation of the Virginia state seal of the state symbol standing triumphant over a slain enemy with the legend: &quot;Rebellion to Tyrants Is Obedience to God&quot;.

The phrase is the motto of the United States Navy attack submarine named for the state, the USS &quot;Virginia&quot;. Before that, it was the motto of the nuclear-powered cruiser USS &quot;Virginia&quot;.

The phrase appears on the Insignia of the 149th Fighter Squadron which is located at Joint Base Langley–Eustis, Virginia.

John Tyler&#x27;s father, John Tyler Sr., uttered the phrase to a schoolteacher who had been tied up by the younger Tyler and his fellow pupils.

In her non-fiction polemical &quot;A Key to Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, Harriet Beecher Stowe noted the irony of runaway slave ads appearing in Southern newspapers with nameplate mottos like &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot; and &quot;Resistance to tyrants is obedience to god&quot;.

During the Civil War, at least one regiment of the United States Colored Troops used it as their motto.

John Wilkes Booth wrote in his diary that he shouted &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot; after shooting U.S. President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865, in part because of the association with the assassination of Caesar. 

The phrase was also in the pro-Confederate Civil War song &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot;, which was popular at the time with Southern sympathizers in Maryland, such as Booth. The song, containing the phrase, was the official state song of Maryland from 1939 until its removal in 2021.

After Thomas Lawrence Higgins pied anti-gay activist Anita Bryant on live television in October 1977, he remarked &quot;thus always to bigots&quot; as a reference to the phrase.

Timothy McVeigh was wearing a T-shirt with this phrase and a picture of Lincoln on it when he was arrested on April 19, 1995, the day he carried out the Oklahoma City bombing.

The phrase is also the motto of Allentown, Pennsylvania, the third largest city in Pennsylvania.

<text>Telluride Regional Airport is a public airport six miles west of Telluride, in San Miguel County, Colorado, United States. It is owned by the Telluride Regional Airport Authority. At an elevation of 9,078 feet (2767 m) above sea level, it was the highest commercial airport in North America with scheduled passenger flights when Great Lakes Airlines resumed scheduled passenger service in December 2016; however, those flights ceased in March 2018. In August 2018, commercial service returned with the introduction of Boutique Air, and the airport remains the highest airfield in the U.S. with scheduled passenger flights, and the second highest overall airfield in the US behind Leadville Airport. Denver Air Connection is currently the only airline flying scheduled passenger flights from Telluride with daily nonstop flights to Denver and Phoenix. Denver Air operates the Fairchild-Dornier 328JET into Telluride. The 328JET is one of the few regional jet airliners in service capable of operating at such high field elevations as TEX.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Telluride Regional Airport covers and has one runway, 9/27, . The runway is on a plateau and still dips slightly in the center, although the dip was more pronounced prior to a renovation in 2009. It can be a challenging but beautiful approach for pilots. In the past during winter months, about 20% of the scheduled commuter airline flights were diverting to other airports because of abruptly adverse landing conditions. This is not unusual since other mountain airports like Sun Valley have similar statistics. When flying to the Telluride Regional Airport, pilots must be aware of unique issues impacting the airfield including high terrain exceeding , as well as the airport&#x27;s location on a plateau with a thousand-foot () drop to the San Miguel River below. Private business jets operate into the Telluride Regional Airport on a regular basis. Other scheduled passenger jet service is available via the Montrose Regional Airport (MTJ), the Durango-La Plata County Airport (DRO) and the Grand Junction Regional Airport (GJT).

In the year ending 2019, the airport had 9,402 aircraft operations, average 26 per day: 99% general aviation and &lt;1% scheduled commercial. 27 aircraft were then based at this airport: 67% single-engine, 11% multi-engine, 14% jet, &lt;1% helicopter and &lt;1% glider.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Historical airline service===
Mesa Airlines introduced the first commercial airline service to Telluride on December 19, 1985, with flights to Albuquerque and Denver using Beechcraft 1900C turboprops. Flights to Phoenix were added a few months later. Monarch Airlines was serving the airport in 1987 with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop flights from Aspen, Crested Butte, Grand Junction and Vail with the latter service being flown from the Eagle County Regional Airport. Rocky Mountain Airways operating as Continental Express on behalf of Continental Airlines served Telluride from 1986 through mid-1991 flying 19-passenger Beechcraft 1900C and 50-passenger de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprops nonstop to Denver (DEN). Some flights stopped in Aspen (ASE) during the 1986/1987 ski season. The four-engine, STOL capable Dash 7 was the largest aircraft ever to provide scheduled passenger service into Telluride. The Continental Express service to Denver was operated by Britt Airways from mid-1991 through March 8, 1994, then replaced with Continental Connection service operated by GP Express Airlines until January 1995.

StatesWest Airlines flew Beechcraft 1900C turboprops nonstop to Laughlin, NV/Bullhead City, AZ with continuing service to Orange County and Los Angeles on Saturdays only during the 1989/1990 ski season. SkyWest Airlines operating as the Delta Connection flew nonstop Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia service to Los Angeles (LAX) during the 1990/1991, 1991/1992, and 1992/1993 ski seasons. WestAir Commuter Airlines operating as United Express flew an Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprop nonstop to Los Angeles on Saturdays only during the 1992/1993 ski season.

In 1990 the Mesa Airlines flights to Denver began operating as United Express on behalf of United Airlines and in 1992 the Phoenix flights began operating as America West Express on behalf of America West Airlines. Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia and de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 aircraft were periodically added to the flight schedules. The Albuquerque flights ended after the 1992/1993 ski season and the Denver flights ended in early 1998 being replaced by Great Lakes Airlines. The Phoenix flights were upgraded to operate with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops in 1998 and then changed over to operate as US Airways Express in 2007 when America West Airlines and US Airways merged. All service by Mesa Airlines ended on April 4, 2011.

Great Lakes Airlines began service to Telluride in mid 1998 by taking over the United Express contract formerly held by Mesa Airlines. Great Lakes flew Beechcraft 1900Ds nonstop to Denver and changed over to operating under their own identity in early 2002 after the carrier lost its designation as a United Express code sharing air carrier. Service to Telluride continued until September 16, 2014. Great Lakes returned to the airport in December 2016 with flights to Denver and later Phoenix and Los Angeles with one stop en route; however, all service ended once again on March 30, 2018, when Great Lakes ceased all of their operations with turboprop aircraft.

Boutique Air was then recruited to reinstate commercial airline service at Telluride with flights to Denver beginning on August 29, 2018. The carrier uses 9-seat single-engine Pilatus PC-12 turboprop aircraft. Service to Cortez with continuing service to Phoenix was added in mid-2019 but all service ended on October 31, 2019.

Key Lime Air operating as Denver Air Connection began the first scheduled jet service into Telluride on May 15, 2019, with the Fairchild Dornier 328JET on a daily flight to Denver. The service will operate year-round with the exception of two short seasonal breaks in the spring and fall.

==Renovation==
Between April 7 and November 4, 2009, the Telluride runway was closed for a $24 million runway renovation. The west end of the runway was lowered 30 feet, and the east end 14 ft. The material removed was placed in the center, removing the notorious dip in the middle of the runway. In addition, 41 feet of length was added to the runway and retaining walls were built on the side. In 2010, crews widened the airfield&#x27;s safety areas from 150 feet to 250 feet, installed an Engineered Materials Arrestor System (EMAS) and finished ancillary aspects of the projects. Work on the EMAS was scheduled at night to prevent disrupting operations. This system is designed in part to allow larger aircraft to utilize the airport.

==Statistics==


== Media appearances ==
Telluride Regional Airport is the destination in the &quot;Telluride Landing&quot; mission supplied with &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X&quot;. The player must land a Bombardier Learjet 45 with passengers on board.

Part of an episode of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; was filmed at the airport, in which the presenters tried to get some Jaguar Cars up to and then stop before going over the cliff at the end of the runway.

<text>Great Lakes Airlines was an American regional airline operating domestic scheduled and charter services. Corporate headquarters were in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with a hub at Denver International Airport.

As of November 2013, Great Lakes Airlines received $58,299,575 in annual federal subsidies for Essential Air Services that they provided to rural airports in the U.S.

Great Lakes Airlines was a large United Express feeder carrier from 1992 to 2002 operating to over 100 cities.

On March 26, 2018, the airline stopped scheduled passenger flights, but continued to support Aerodynamics Inc. flights through September 1, 2018.

== History ==

The airline was established by Doug Voss and Ivan Simpson and started operations on April 5, 1977 as Spirit Lake Airways. It was reorganised and began scheduled services on October 12, 1981, as Great Lakes Airlines with flights between Spencer and Des Moines, Iowa. In February 1988, Great Lakes acquired Alliance Airlines.
 In February 1992 Great Lakes signed a codeshare agreement with United Airlines becoming a United Express feeder carrier. From 1992 through 2002 Great Lakes operated extensive United Express operations with hubs at Chicago O&#x27;Hare and Denver and also at Minneapolis where United Airlines did not have a hub operation. Other United Express operations were also flown between Phoenix and Page, Arizona; Detroit to Alpena and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan; and a shuttle operation between Springfield, Illinois and Chicago&#x27;s Meigs Field. All flights were operated with 19-seat Beechcraft 1900D and 30-seat Embraer 120 Brasilia aircraft. On June 1, 1998 the airline greatly expanded its Denver hub by adding the United Express routes formerly operated by Mesa Airlines.

Prior to the relocation of the headquarters to Cheyenne, Great Lakes was headquartered in Summit Township, Clay County, Iowa, by Spencer Municipal Airport and near the city of Spencer.

By early 1995, Great Lakes acquired Northern Star Airlines dba Midway Connection on behalf of Midway Airlines (1993-2003). 
Many routes from Chicago Midway International Airport were obtained that Great Lakes switched to operate from Chicago O&#x27;hare International Airport under the United Express banner. Northern Star/Midway Connection had previously obtained the assets of commuter airline Direct Air in mid-1993.

In late 1995, Great Lakes acquired the assets of Arizona Airways obtaining routes from a hub at Tucson International Airport to Phoenix and Page, Arizona, as well as to Albuquerque, NM, and to several points in northern Mexico. Service was also added from Phoenix to Show Low, Arizona. This operation ended on May 16, 1997.

Great Lakes&#x27; status as United Express was downgraded in early 2002 when it became an independent carrier but still maintained an indirect codeshare agreement with United Airlines as well as establishing a new code share with Frontier Airlines. Since then Great Lakes saw a steady decline in traffic and service to many cities was dropped including the entire hub operation at Chicago O&#x27;Hare. The Minneapolis hub was also closed however a small operation there was reinstated on March 17, 2012 when Essential Air Service (EAS) routes formerly flown by Northwest Airlink carriers were obtained. The Minneapolis hub closed again by 2016. The Denver hub then became the main focus for Great Lakes however routes from that hub were vanishing as well. Many cities the carrier once served as United Express no longer have any airline service.

New flights from Albuquerque to Clovis and Silver City, NM were added on April 3, 2005 after obtaining the EAS contracts for these cities formerly held by Mesa Airlines. These flights operated until November 30, 2012. EAS subsidized flights also operated from small hubs at Phoenix, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Billings during 2002 through 2018.

A hub operation at Ontario International Airport was established on April 7, 2009, with routes to Merced and Visalia, California; and to Kingman and Prescott, Arizona; both continuing onto Farmington, New Mexico. The operation was switched from Ontario to Los Angeles, California on May 15, 2011. The airline added service to a new hub serving Las Vegas, Nevada, on April 7, 2010, with routes to Ely, Nevada; Page, Arizona; Farmington, NM; and Merced and Visalia, California. The Las Vegas hub was closed in April 2013. During the years of the hub operations at Phoenix, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Ontario, Great Lakes would operate flights by way of Farmington to connect these hubs with the main hub in Denver. A maintenance base was also established at Farmington. 

In 2013, a new government ruling requiring first officers to have a minimum of 1500 flight hours and restrictions on crew rest and duty times created a severe hardship for Great Lakes as well as many other commuter airlines. The airline was then forced to pull ten seats out of most of its 19-seat Beech 1900D aircraft. Many flights had to be cancelled as well as all service to several cities including Mason City Municipal Airport. On April 1, 2015, service to Sheridan, Wyoming was dropped leaving the remote city with no air service. Sheridan had been served since the early days of aviation by many airlines, some with jets including Boeing 737s by Western Airlines. Most routes Great Lakes has served are subsidized through Essential Air Service. Through its history the airline is known to have served at least 162 cities and 164 airports (three at Chicago) but was down to only seven cities as of March 22, 2018.

Great Lakes had a rather unusual theme where many of their Beech 1900D aircraft had their tails painted advertising cities that they flew to as well as National Parks in their territory. Some of the tails advertised the cities of Laramie, Wyoming; Alamosa and Telluride, Colorado; Scottsbluff, Nebraska; Ponca City, Oklahoma; Garden City, Kansas, Dodge City, Kansas and Liberal, Kansas; Sierra Vista, Arizona; Pierre, South Dakota; Miles City, Montana, as well as the White Mountains of Arizona, the Teton Range and Devils Tower in Wyoming.

On June 2, 2016, Great Lakes Airlines, Silver Airways and Frontier Airlines announced a partnership for recruiting pilots.

On March 26, 2018, Great Lakes Airlines announced that operations would be suspended effective at midnight. Despite ceasing operations, the company didn&#x27;t file for bankruptcy and certain segments of the company continued to operate. Flights to Pierre, South Dakota and Watertown, South Dakota continued to operate through Great Lakes Jet Express.

== Destinations ==

Great Lakes Airlines was the largest Essential Air Service provider in the United States for many years but served only two of its seven destinations through the Essential Air Service program prior to ceasing operations.

===Great Lakes Jet Express===

In 2016, Great Lakes entered into a codeshare agreement named Great Lakes Jet Express where they would sell tickets: for Elite Airways to and from Denver and Houston to Branson Airport; for Aerodynamics Inc. on a route from Chicago O&#x27;Hare to Youngstown, and later an EAS route from Denver to Pierre with onward continuing service to Watertown, South Dakota. This controversial practice allows the codesharing carriers to take advantage of Great Lakes&#x27; existing distribution and interline agreements with global distribution systems and other airlines. The Chicago to Youngstown route was cancelled less than two months after it began because United Airlines refused to honor its interline agreement with Great Lakes in Chicago, stating that only connections in Denver were covered under the agreement. The service on Elite Airways from Denver and Houston to Branson, Missouri was also cancelled shortly after it began.

== Fleet ==

During the 1980s Great Lakes operated Beechcraft C99 and Beechcraft 1900C commuter turboprop aircraft. The carrier operated two types of turboprop aircraft, being the Beechcraft 1900D and the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia. Great Lakes was at one time the world&#x27;s largest operator of the Beechcraft 1900.

As of September 2017, the Great Lakes Airlines fleet included the following aircraft:

==Accidents and incidents==

* On November 19, 1996, United Express Flight 5925 operated by Great Lakes Airlines, a Beechcraft 1900, collided with a King Air during landing at Quincy Regional Airport. The ten passengers and two crew members on board were killed. The pilots of the King Air were blamed for failing to effectively monitor both the common frequency and to scan for traffic.
* On August 19, 1998, United Express Flight 1605 operated by Great Lakes Airlines, a Beechcraft 1900, was substantially damaged. Shortly after the airplane took off, the crew heard a loud noise and felt a slight vibration from the left propeller. They returned and landed. It was discovered that the propeller erosion shield had debonded and a portion had penetrated the passenger cabin just aft of the airstair door, knocked ajar Seat 1A Passenger Service Unit, ricocheted off the ceiling, and penetrated the inner window pane at Seat 2C. One passenger was injured.

<doc id="307656" wikidata="Q1172276" url="?curid=307656" title="Datapoint 2200">
<text>The Datapoint 2200 was a mass-produced programmable terminal usable as a computer, designed by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) founders Phil Ray and Gus Roche and announced by CTC in June 1970 (with units shipping in 1971). It was initially presented by CTC as a versatile and cost-efficient terminal for connecting to a wide variety of mainframes by loading various terminal emulations from tape rather than being hardwired as most contemporary terminals, including their earlier Datapoint 3300.

Dave Gust, a CTC salesman, realized that the 2200 could meet Pillsbury Foods&#x27;s need for a small computer in the field, after which the 2200 was marketed as a stand-alone computer. Its industrial designer John &quot;Jack&quot; Frassanito has later claimed that Ray and Roche always intended the Datapoint 2200 to be a full-blown personal computer, but that they chose to keep quiet about this so as not to concern investors and others.

The terminal&#x27;s multi-chip CPU (processor)&#x27;s instruction set became the basis of the Intel 8008 instruction set, which inspired the Intel 8080 instruction set and the x86 instruction set used in the processors for the original IBM PC and its descendants.

== Technical description ==

The Datapoint 2200 had a built-in full-travel keyboard, a built-in 12-line, 80-column green screen monitor, and two 47 character-per-inch cassette tape drives each with 130 KB capacity. Its size, , and shape—a box with protruding keyboard—approximated that of an IBM Selectric typewriter. Initially, a Diablo 2.5 MB 2315-type removable cartridge hard disk drive was available, along with modems, several types of serial interface, parallel interface, printers and a punched card reader. Later, an 8-inch floppy disk drive was also made available, along with other, larger hard disk drives. An industry-compatible 7/9-track (user selectable) magnetic tape drive was available by 1975. In late 1977, Datapoint introduced ARCNET local area networking. The original Type 1 2200 shipped with 2 kilobytes (KiB) of serial shift register main memory, expandable to 8 KiB. The Type 2 2200 used denser 1 kbit RAM chips, giving it a default 4 KiB of memory, expandable to 16 KiB. Its starting price was around US$5,000 (), and a full 16 KiB Type 2 2200 had a list price of just over $14,000.

The 8-bit processor architecture that CTC designed for the Datapoint 2200 was implemented in four distinct ways, all with nearly identical instruction sets, but very different internal microarchitectures: CTC&#x27;s original design that communicated data serially, CTC&#x27;s parallel design, the Texas Instruments TMC 1795, and the Intel 8008.

The 2200 models were succeeded by the 5500, 1100, 6600, 3800/1800, 8800, etc.

The fact that most laptops and cloud computers today store numbers in little-endian format is carried forward from the original Datapoint 2200. Because the original Datapoint 2200 had a serial processor, it needed to start with the lowest bit of the lowest byte in order to handle carries. Microprocessors descended from the Datapoint 2200 (the 8008, Z80, and the x86 chips used in most laptops and cloud computers today) kept the little-endian format used by that original Datapoint 2200.

==Processor==
The original design called for a single-chip 8-bit microprocessor for the CPU, rather than a processor built from discrete TTL modules as was conventional at the time. In 1969, CTC contracted two companies, Intel and Texas Instruments (TI), to make the chip. TI was unable to make a reliable part and dropped out. Intel was unable to make CTC&#x27;s deadline. Intel and CTC renegotiated their contract, ending up with CTC keeping its money and Intel keeping the eventually completed processor.

CTC released the Datapoint 2200 using about 100 TTL components (SSI/MSI chips) instead of a microprocessor, while Intel&#x27;s single-chip design, eventually designated the Intel 8008, was finally released in April 1972.

Possibly because of their speed advantages compared to MOS circuits, Datapoint continued to build processors out of TTL chips until the early 1980s.

Nonetheless, the 8008 was to have a seminal importance. It was the basis of Intel&#x27;s line of 8-bit CPUs, which was followed by their assembly language compatible 16-bit CPUs — the first members of the x86 family, as the instruction set was later to be known. Already successful and widely used, the x86 architecture&#x27;s further rise after the success in 1981 of the original IBM Personal Computer with an Intel 8088 CPU means that most desktop, laptop, and server computers in use have a CPU instruction set directly based on the work of CTC&#x27;s engineers. The instruction set of the highly successful Zilog Z80 microprocessor can also be traced back to the Datapoint 2200 as the Z80 was backwards-compatible with the Intel 8080. More immediately, the Intel 8008 was adopted by very early microcomputers including the SCELBI, Mark-8, MCM/70 and Micral N.

== Instruction set ==
Instructions are one to three bytes long, consisting of an initial opcode byte, followed by up to two bytes of operands which can be an immediate operand or a program address. Instructions operate on 8-bits only; there are no 16-bit operations. There is only one mechanism to address data memory: indirect addressing pointed to by a concatenation of the H and L registers, referenced as M. The 2200 does, however, support 13-bit program addresses. It has automatic CALL and RETURN instructions for multi-level subroutine calls and returns which can be conditionally executed, like jumps. Direct copying may be made between any two registers or a register and memory. Eight math/logic functions are supported between the accumulator (A) and any register, memory, or an immediate value. Results are always deposited in A. Most instructions are executed in 16 μs, 24 μs, or a leisurely 520 μs when accessing M. The 520 μs represents the delay of the 2200&#x27;s shift register memory to fully recirculate back to the next instruction. Branch type instructions take a variable amount of time (24 μs to 520 μs) depending on the distance of the branch.

===Performance===
Although the Datapoint 2200 version I is somewhat faster than an Intel 8008 on register instructions, any reference to the 2200&#x27;s shift-register memory incurs a large 520 μs delay. Also any JMP, CALL, or RETURN can incur a variable delay up to 520 μs depending on the distance to the new address. The parallel-architecture Datapoint 2200 version II is much faster than either.
===Code example===
The following Datapoint 2200 assembly source code is for a subroutine named MEMCPY that copies a block of data bytes from one location to another. Because the byte counter is only 8 bits, there is enough room to load all the subroutine parameters into the 2200&#x27;s register file. Datapoint 2200 version I transfers 374 bytes per second using this routine. A 500 kHz Intel 8008 executes this code almost four times faster, transferring 1,479 bytes per second. Datapoint 2200 version II is much faster than either at 9,615 bytes per second. If more than an 8-bit count is needed, a more complicated copy routine with parameters held in memory would be required.

== Credits ==
The original instruction set architecture was developed by Victor Poor and Harry Pyle. The TTL design they ended up using was made by Gary Asbell. Industrial design (how the box&#x27;s exterior looked, including the company&#x27;s logo) was done by Jack Frassanito.

<text>Serra do Bouro is a former civil parish in the municipality of Caldas da Rainha, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Caldas da Rainha — Santo Onofre e Serra do Bouro. The civil parish had an area of and had a population of 703 at the 2011 census. It the least populous &quot;freguesia&quot; of the municipality.

Localities (&quot;lugares&quot;) within Serra do Bouro include
Cidade,
Cabeço da Vela,

Casais da Boavista,
Casais da Cidade,

Serra do Bouro has cliffs overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

Principal activities of the inhabitants include agriculture and civil construction.

Serra do Bouro once belonged to the municipality of Óbidos, but the &quot;freguesia&quot; was transferred to Caldas da Rainha as this latter municipality developed economically. Two other &quot;freguesias&quot; of Caldas da Rainha were once part of Serra do Bouro, but were elevated to the status of &quot;freguesia&quot; themselves: Foz do Arelho in 1919 and Nadadouro in 1957.

== History ==

The area of Serra, as the locals know it, was first inhabited by the Veiga family in the 16th century. This freguesia changed little throughout much time. Electricity and municipal water reached Serra in the 1980s.

Throughout the 1900s most of the area&#x27;s inhabitants emigrated to other countries, particularly to the United States. One of the greatest concentrations of Serra do Bouro descendants is in the area of Perth Amboy, New Jersey &quot;(sister city to Caldas da Rainha)&quot;.

Serra has a cemetery called the &quot;Cemitério dos Ingleses&quot; (English Cemetery) where remains of two children and 6 women are buried from the October 28, 1892 shipwreck of the S.S. Roumania, an English ship.

<text>El Pollo Loco (Spanish for &quot;The Crazy Chicken&quot;) is the name of three independent restaurant chains that specialize in Mexican-style grilled chicken. The Mexican and American companies were founded by Juan Francisco Ochoa while the Filipino company began as a franchisee of the American company in 1991 that later broke free of its contract and was allowed to retain its trademarks within the Philippines in 2016.

Ochoa established the first El Pollo Loco restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico in 1974. He then expanded his chain into the United States in 1980. He later sold his U.S. restaurants in 1983 while keeping the ones in Mexico. The two North American companies have since occupied non-overlapping global territories and have offered different fare.

* [[El Pollo Loco (Mexico)]] is the chain still owned by Ochoa&#x27;s family and operates over 50 () locations within Mexico.
* [[El Pollo Loco (United States)]] operates about 500 () company-owned and franchised restaurants primarily in the Southwestern United States. Since 2014, the U.S.-based company has been publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker LOCO.
* [[El Pollo Loco (Philippines)]] is a subsidiary of Manila-based The Bistro Group that operated 10 () company-owned restaurants within the Manila metropolitan area.

<text>Andrew Dewey Kirk (May 28, 1898 – December 11, 1992) was an American jazz bandleader and saxophonist who led the Twelve Clouds of Joy, a band popular during the swing era.

==Life and career==
He was born in Newport, Kentucky, United States. Kirk grew up in Denver, Colorado, where he was tutored by Wilberforce Whiteman, Paul Whiteman&#x27;s father. Kirk started his musical career playing with George Morrison&#x27;s band, but then went on to join Terrence Holder&#x27;s Dark Clouds of Joy. In 1929, he was elected leader after Holder departed. Renaming the band Clouds of Joy, Kirk also relocated the band from Dallas, Texas, to Kansas City, Missouri. Although named the Clouds of Joy, the band has also been known as the Twelve Clouds of Joy due to the number of musicians in the band. They set up in the Pla-Mor Ballroom on the junction of 32nd Street and Main Street in Kansas City and made their first recording for Brunswick Records that same year. Mary Lou Williams came in as pianist at the last moment, but she impressed Brunswick&#x27;s Dave Kapp, so she became a member of the band.

After their first recordings in 1929–1930, they grew popular as they epitomized the Kansas City jazz sound. In mid-1936, he was signed to Decca and made scores of popular records until 1946. He presumably disbanded and reformed his band during that six-year recording layoff, as his 1929–1930 Brunswick appeared to have sold well enough to stay in the catalog through the period and 1933-34 pressings (with the mid-1930s label variations) have been seen.

In 1938, Kirk and band held the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for 12 weeks with &quot;I Won&#x27;t Tell a Soul (I Love You)&quot;, written by Hughie Charles and Ross Parker, featuring Pha Terrell on vocals. In 1942, Kirk and His Clouds of Joy recorded &quot;Take It and Git&quot;, which on October 24, 1942, became the first single to hit number one on the Harlem Hit Parade, the predecessor to the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. In 1943, with June Richmond on vocals, he had a number 4 hit with &quot;Hey Lawdy Mama&quot;.

== Clouds of Joy ==
The band at various times included Buddy Tate (tenor saxophone), Claude Williams (violin), Pha Terrell (vocals), Mary Lou&#x27;s then husband, John Williams, Bill Coleman, Ken Kersey, Dick Wilson, Don Byas, &quot;Shorty&quot; Baker, Howard McGhee, Jimmy Forrest, Ben Smith, Fats Navarro, Charlie Parker (briefly), Reuben Phillips, Ben Thigpen, Henry Wells, Milt Robinson, Floyd Smith, Hank Jones, Johnny Lynch, Joe Williams, Big Jim Lawson, Gino Murray and Joe Evans.

Their pianist, and the band&#x27;s arranger, was Mary Lou Williams, who went on to become a prominent figure in jazz.

In 1948, Kirk disbanded the Clouds of Joy and continued to work as a musician, but eventually switched to hotel management and real estate. He also served as an official in the Musicians&#x27; Union.

==Death==
He died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in New York at the age of 94.

==Discography==
He recorded 78s with Brunswick from 1930 to 1931, with Decca from 1936 to 1945, Coral in 1950.

<text>Dabbala Rajagopal &quot;Raj&quot; Reddy (born 13 June 1937) is an Indian-American computer scientist and a winner of the Turing Award. He is one of the early pioneers of artificial intelligence and has served on the faculty of Stanford and Carnegie Mellon for over 50 years. He was the founding director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. He was instrumental in helping to create Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies in India, to cater to the educational needs of the low-income, gifted, rural youth. He was the founding chairman of International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. He was the first person of Asian origin to receive the Turing Award, in 1994, sometimes known as the Nobel Prize of computer science, for his work in the field of artificial intelligence.

==Early life and education==
Raj Reddy was born in a Telugu speaking Telugu family in Katur village of Chittoor district of present-day Andhra Pradesh, India. His father, Sreenivasulu Reddy, was a landowner, and his mother, Pitchamma, was a homemaker. He was the first member of his family to attend college.

After graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil engineering from College of Engineering, Guindy (presently Anna University, Chennai, affiliated to University of Madras), he went to Australia as an intern. While a student at the University of New South Wales, he started using an English Electric Deuce Mark II computer (Vacuum Tube, Mercury Delay line memory with punch card I/O). After graduating with an MTech degree from UNSW in 1960, he joined IBM where he worked as an Applied Science representative. In 1963 he joined Stanford University, graduating in 1966 as the first PhD in AI under John McCarthy. After 3 years on the Faculty at Stanford, he joined Carnegie Mellon University to work with AI pioneers Allen Newell and Herb Simon.

==Career==
Reddy is the University Professor of Computer Science and Robotics and Moza Bint Nasser Chair at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. From 1960, he worked for IBM in Australia. He was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University from 1966 to 1969. He joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty as an associate professor of Computer Science in 1969. He became a full professor in 1973 and a university professor, in 1984.

He was the founding director of the Robotics Institute from 1979 to 1991 and the Dean of School of Computer Science from 1991 to 1999. As a dean of SCS, he helped create the Language Technologies Institute, Human Computer Interaction Institute, Center for Automated Learning and Discovery (since renamed as the Machine Learning Department), and the Institute for Software Research. He is the chairman of Governing Council of IIIT Hyderabad. He was the founding Chancellor (2008-2019) of Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT).

Reddy was a co-chair of the President&#x27;s Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) from 1999 to 2001. He was one of the founders of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence and was its president from 1987 to 1989. He served on the International board of governors of Peres Center for Peace in Israel. He served as a member of the governing councils of EMRI and HMRI which use technology-enabled solutions to provide cost-effective health care coverage to rural population in India.

==AI Research==
Reddy&#x27;s early research was conducted at the AI labs at Stanford, first as a graduate student and later as an assistant professor, and at CMU since 1969. His AI research concentrated on perceptual and motor aspect of intelligence such as speech, language, vision and robotics. Over a span of five decades, Reddy and his colleagues created several demonstrations of spoken language systems, e.g., voice control of a robot, large vocabulary connected speech recognition, speaker independent speech recognition, and unrestricted vocabulary dictation. Reddy and his colleagues have made seminal contributions to Task Oriented Computer Architectures, Analysis of Natural Scenes, Universal Access to Information, and Autonomous Robotic Systems. Hearsay I was one of the first systems capable of continuous speech recognition. Subsequent systems like Hearsay II, Dragon, Harpy, and Sphinx I/II developed many of the ideas underlying modern commercial speech recognition technology as summarized in his recent historical review of speech recognition with Xuedong Huang and James K. Baker. Some of these ideas—most notably the &quot;blackboard model&quot; for coordinating multiple knowledge sources—have been adopted across the spectrum of applied artificial intelligence.

== Technology in Service of Society ==
Reddy&#x27;s other major research interest has been in exploring the role of &quot;Technology in Service of Society&quot;. One of the early efforts, was founded by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber in France in 1981 with a technical team consisting of Nicholas Negroponte, Alan Kay, Seymour Papert, Raj Reddy, and Terry Winograd. Reddy served as the Chief Scientist for the center. The centre had as its objective the Development of Human Resource in Third World Countries using Information Technology. Several seminal experiments in providing computerized classrooms and rural medical delivery were attempted.  In 1984, President Mitterrand decorated Reddy with the Légion d&#x27;Honneur medal.

Universal Digital Library Project was started by Raj Reddy, Robert Thibadeau, Jaime Carbonell, Michael Shamos, and Gloriana S. Clair in the 1990s, to scan books and other media such as music, videos, paintings, and newspapers and to provide online access to all creative works to anyone, anywhere at any time. A larger Million Book Project was started in 2001 as a collaborative effort with China (Professors Pan Yunhe, Yuting Zhuang, Gao Wen) and India (Prof N. Balakrishnan).

Marks of a student are a result of several factors such as the quality of the teachers, the education level of the parents, the ability to pay for coaching classes and the time spent on the task of learning the subject. Rural students tend to be at a serious disadvantage along each of these dimensions. Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) was created for educating gifted rural youth in Andhra Pradesh in 2008, by Drs. Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, K. C. Reddy, and Raj Reddy, based on the premise that the current nationwide merit-based admissions, such as SAT tests, are flawed and do not provide a level playing field for gifted youth from rural areas.

Reddy proposed that a fully connected population makes it possible to think of a KG-to-PG-Online-College in every village providing personalized instruction. Assuming that all students are provided digital literacy and learning-to-learn training as part of primary education before they dropout, anyone can learn any subject at any age even if there are no qualified teachers on the subject.

AI can be used to empower the people at the bottom-of-the-pyramid, who have not benefited from the IT revolution so far. Reddy proposed that recent technological advances in AI will ultimately enable anyone to watch any movie, read any textbook, and talk to anyone independent of the language of the producer or consumer. He also proposed that the use of Smart Sensor Watches can be used to eliminate COVID lockdowns by monitoring the sensor data to identify and isolate people with symptoms.

==Awards and honors==
He is a fellow of the AAAI, ACM, Acoustical Society of America, IEEE and Computer History Museum. Reddy is a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Chinese Academy of Engineering, Indian National Science Academy, and Indian National Academy of Engineering.

He has been awarded honorary doctorates (Doctor Honoris Causa) from SV University, Universite Henri-Poincare, University of New South Wales, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, University of Massachusetts, University of Warwick, Anna University, IIIT (Prayagraj), Andhra University, IIT Kharagpur, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies, and Carnegie Mellon University. 

In 1994 he and Edward Feigenbaum received the Turing Award, &quot;for pioneering the design and construction of large scale artificial intelligence systems, demonstrating the practical importance and potential commercial impact of artificial intelligence technology.&quot; In 1984, Reddy was awarded the French Legion of Honour by French President François Mitterrand. Reddy also received Padma Bhushan, from the President of India in 2001, the Okawa Prize in 2004, the Honda Prize in 2005, and the Vannevar Bush Award in 2006.

<doc id="307670" wikidata="Q6942121" url="?curid=307670" title="Music of Indiana">
<text>The music of Indiana was strongly influenced by a large number of German and Irish immigrants who arrived in the 1830s. A prime example is &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You Home Again, Kathleen&quot; written by Thomas Westendorf, from Hendricks County, Indiana, in 1875.

Indiana was one of the first places where jazz music became popular outside of New Orleans and Chicago. In the late 1910s and through the 1920s the state had numerous bands of young musicians playing the new style for dancing.

Richmond, Indiana was home to Gennett Records, known for recording a wealth of jazz, blues, and country music in the 1920s. Gary, Indiana was home of Vee-Jay Records, known for blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll in the 1950s and early 1960s.

Indiana-born musicians and composers include John Mellencamp, Michael Jackson (also of Gary&#x27;s The Jackson 5), Janet Jackson, Kenneth &#x27;Babyface&#x27; Edmonds, John Hiatt, Steve Wariner, Hoosier Hot Shots, Harry Von Tilzer, Rich Mullins, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Hazel Harrison, May Aufderheide, Cecil Duane Crabb, Julia Lee Niebergall, Kris Roe, The Four Freshmen, The Ink Spots, The Spaniels, the Bill Gaither Trio, John Michael Talbot, Albert Von Tilzer, Cole Porter (&quot;Night and Day&quot;, d.1964, buried in Peru, IN), Hoagy Carmichael (graduate of Indiana University, buried in Bloomington), Stuart Gorrell, Carrie Newcomer, Amanda Biggs, Janie Fricke, Lonnie Mack, Tiara Thomas, Henry Lee Summer; Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, and DJ Ashba (all of Guns N&#x27; Roses); David Lee Roth of Van Halen, Shannon Hoon (d. 1995, buried in Lafayette) of Blind Melon, Travis Meeks of Days of the New, Kyle Cook of Matchbox Twenty, Mick Mars of Mötley Crüe, Ted Leo, Adam Lambert, and Michael Barber.

Additional musicians of various genres from Indiana include Bobby Helms (&quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; from &#x27;57; buried near Indianapolis), The Rivieras from South Bend (&quot;California Sun&quot; from &#x27;64, #5 on Billboard Hot 100), Junior Walker from South Bend (&quot;Shotgun&quot; &#x27;65, #4 on Billboard Hot 100 ), Junior Brown from the Bloomington area, After 7 r&amp;b group with Babyface&#x27;s brothers (&quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;), Days of the New from Charlestown (&quot;Touch, Peel and Stand&quot; &#x27;98, #1 on Mainstream Rock chart), The Ataris from Anderson (&quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; &#x27;03, #2 on Alternative Songs chart), country singer Jace Everett from Evansville (&quot;Bad Things&quot; (the theme song for &quot;True Blood&quot; &#x27;08), Houndmouth from a Louisville suburb, Umphrey&#x27;s McGee from South Bend (singer Brendan Bayliss went to the University of Notre Dame), The Ready Set from Fort Wayne (&quot;Love Like Woe&quot; &#x27;10), and Chris Wallace (&quot;Remember When (Push Rewind)&quot;) from 2012).

Van Halen (with David Lee Roth) had a #1 hit on the Hot 100 with &quot;Jump&quot;, also in 1984. Guns N&#x27; Roses (with Axl Rose) had a #1 hit on the Hot 100 with &quot;Sweet Child O&#x27; Mine.&quot; And The McCoys had a #1 Hot 100 hit in 1965 with &quot;Hang On Sloopy.&quot; All of the above (and John Cougar Mellencamp, who had a #1 hit with &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; in 1982) are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, except Deniece Williams, and The McCoys. John Mellencamp had 7 #1 songs on the Mainstream Rock chart in the 80s and early 90s. The John Mellencamp Pavilion at Indiana University was named after him.

FreshDuzIt, a hip-hop musician himself from Indianapolis, Producer of 2× Platinum single &quot;Camelot&#x27;, which reached No. 37 on Billboard magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 chart, a rare accomplishment for any tune associated with an Indianapolis hip-hop act.

==Indigenous music==

==Country music==
Country music is very thick in Southern Indiana, an area considered part of the Upland South.

The bluegrass festival Bill Monroe Memorial Festival has been held in Bean Blossom, IN every June since 1967.There were many Rock N Roll Bars Nite Clubs and Venues in the 70&#x27;s in and around the Indianapolis area. All you had to do was draw the Big crowd and Rock the House. One such band was The Dave Lady Band.

==Jazz==

Johnson, Freddie Hubbard, Carl Perkins, Cal Collins, Royce Campbell, Noble Sissle, Claude Thornhill, Larry Ridley, Gary Burton, Jane Jarvis, Leroy Vinnegar, Pete Candoli, Conte Candoli, Jamey Aebersold, Andy Simpkins, and David Baker.

==Punk rock==
In Indianapolis, a vibrant 1970s punk rock and new wave scene existed, including Latex Novelties, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Dow Jones and the Industrials (from West Lafayette). One of the most influential Indiana punk bands was The Gizmos, from Bloomington, who spawned a thriving local alternative scene that included the likes of Amoebas in Chaos and The Dancing Cigarettes. Later, a hardcore punk and alternative rock band from Indianapolis called the Zero Boys became the single most important punk band ever to arise from the state. The Zero Boys started trying to make a local hardcore scene after seeing the Dead Kennedys in Chicago. Paul Mahern of the Zero Boys led the effort, and founded Affirmation Records, releasing several compilations and recordings from Articles of Faith (from Chicago) and local band Killing Children before going out of business. Indianapolis/Bloomington is home to post-hardcore/emo band Split Lip/Chamberlain who helped influence other emo contemporaries in the midwest such as Braid and The Get Up Kids. The Ataris formed in Anderson in the mid-90s by Anderson native Kristopher Roe. 
Bloomington has a large folk punk music scene. The town is home to Chris Clavin who runs the DIY punk rock record label Plan-It-X Records and is in the band Ghost Mice. Every other year Plan-It-X Records organizes Plan-it-X Fest, a large DIY punk music festival held in Bloomington. Bloomington is also home to the record labels Secretly Canadian, Jagjaguwar, and BlueSanct. From Kokomo, another folk punk group is Harley Poe fronted by Joe Whiteford.

Lafayette is the home of Mass Giorgini&#x27;s (of Squirtgun, Screeching Weasel, and Common Rider fame) Sonic Iguana Studios. Several legendary national and international punk bands have recorded or mastered their releases at Sonic Iguana, including platinum-selling acts such as Rise Against. Lafayette / West Lafayette is home to punk rock record label Oi! the boat records whose roster includes bands from around the US and Europe. In the 1980s, the Lafayette music scene featured bands such as Rattail Grenadier (later Squirtgun), Stone Soup (featuring Carrie Newcomer), East of Eden (with Newcomer&#x27;s husband and guitarist Rob Meitus on guitar), and Styff Kytten (featuring Shannon Hoon later of Blind Melon. Izzy Stradlin and Axl Rose, both of whom went on to form Hollywood Rose and Guns N&#x27; Roses also emerged from the Lafayette music scene in the 1980s.

In Northern Indiana, South Bend is home of Plinko Productions, led by Garth Plinko who recorded many of South Bend&#x27;s punk bands throughout the 1990s. Garth is also the founding member of the Urinal Mints, who have toured all over the US and Europe. The band released four CDs: &quot;Vulgar Display of Ass&quot;, &quot;Minty Fresh and In the Flesh&quot; (Live CD), &quot;Fourteen&#x27;ll Getcha Twenty&quot;, and &quot;Own Your Soul&quot;. The Urinal Mints are the main reason the Northern Indiana punk scene prospered in the late 1990s and 2000s, by bringing in several national touring acts, hosting shows, and building a network with other Midwest bands. Plinko Productions is also responsible for the &quot;Shit Like a Champion&quot; series, the very first local punk rock compilations. Wrecked Hooligan Records came into being in 2012 and has since released compilations titled &quot;No Coast, No Problem&quot; which features many of the South Bend punk bands, as well as bands throughout the Midwest. South Bend was also home to The Aakata&#x27;s. The Aakata&#x27;s are widely credited with keeping the punk torch lit in northern Indiana. From their earliest days as a band, The Aakata&#x27;s stood apart from their punk peers with their musicianship, as well as their lyrics. The Aakata&#x27;s style often draws comparison with the Clash and Sex Pistols. The Aakata&#x27;s emerged as a response to what was perceived to be the increasingly safe and bloated punk rock, heavy metal and manufactured alternative music of the mid-1990s. The band created various controversies during their career which captivated the Indiana punk scene, but often eclipsed their music. Their shows and tours repeatedly faced difficulties from authorities, and public appearances often ended in disaster and riot. The group went on hiatus in 2004.

Music groups from the MySpace music era originated in Greenwood, Indiana such as crunkcore group Dot Dot Curve.

==Hardcore==
The Hardcore music scene has been flourishing in Indiana cities such as Indianapolis, Bloomington, Muncie, Fort Wayne, and Richmond since the 1980s, and also in other parts of the state such as Northwest Indiana.

This is due to access at one time to small independent record stores such as Hegewisch Records in Merrillville, distros at shows, tape trading, word of mouth, flyering, the tenacity of die-hard music fans and musicians and more recently the internet.

Northwest Indiana in particular was a hotbed for Hardcore due to its already established metal scene and place in the urban decay of the rust belt. It really took off in the 1990s with the bands Right Arm Death Threat from Laporte and Take A Stand from Michigan City. Having members that had lived in New York and Chicago and being influenced first hand by the scenes in those cities as well as the well established, known and thriving scene in Chesterton, its large number of bands for a small town, (Failsafe, Aberration, The Chesterton Hardcore Conspiracy, The Dan Light Quartet, The Big Red Music Company, Suicide Note, and Until I Died just to name a few) its DIY ethic, and number of National and International acts playing mainly at the Westport Community Center on their way to or from Chicago.

Being in a cover band saturated market, members of these bands started networking across the region and started booking shows for their own bands as well as bringing acts from other cities and far away places. It soon took off and there were shows every other week and bands popping up every day. Strong connections to nearby already established scenes in Chicago, South Bend, Indianapolis and Detroit were made and growth continued producing even more bands such as After The Quarrel, Shut The Fuck Up, and most notably Blood In/ Blood Out. Apathy, commercialism and violence marred the scene during the 2000s and as with any punk genre and subcultures in general people come and go, personal lives take precedence over participation, and Things change but, the majority of the stalwarts remain and the ball keeps rolling with shows in Hammond and Gary and new bands such as No Dice and All These Years and Nothing, plus strong ties to the Heavy Metal and Hip-hop communities, as well as international ties to the Punk and Hardcore scene from the years of hard work, perseverance and resistance to the powers that be.

==Hip hop music==
 In 1993, independent label Pump the Mix Productions released &quot;Firs&#x27; From tha Bend&quot; which is a 5-track EP consisting of tracks produced by DJ Machete and rapper Q-Swon, both natives of South Bend. Independent hip hop group The Mudkids hail from Indianapolis. Producer Elp-Mass and emcee Rusty Redenbacher made up the classic hip hop combo of emcee and dj/producer. Both artists are currently active in other musical endeavors. Indiana hip hop can be found mostly these days through Bringing Down The Band, a national and Indiana-based blog and brand founded in 2009. Notable Indiana-based independent hip hop artists include Freddie Gibbs, FreshDuzIt, Mark Battles and Kid Quill.

Indianapolis hip-hop act. Production team 1Mind — made up of Indianapolis natives Mac Sutphin, Sebastian Lopez and Michael Lohmeier — crafted the beat for &quot;Unforgettable,&quot; a Top 5 hit for French Montana and Swae Lee in 2017.

<text>The Ossetians ( or ; ), also known as Ossetes ( ), Ossets ( ), and [[Alans]] ( ), are an Iranian ethnic group who are indigenous to Ossetia, a region situated across the northern and southern sides of the Caucasus Mountains. They natively speak Ossetic, an Eastern Iranian language of the Indo-European language family, with most also being fluent in Russian as a second language.

Currently, the Ossetian homeland of Ossetia is politically divided between North Ossetia–Alania in Russia, and the &quot;de facto&quot; country of South Ossetia (recognized by the United Nations as Russian-occupied territory that is &quot;de jure&quot; part of Georgia). Their closest historical and linguistic relatives, the Jász people, live in the Jászság region within the northwestern part of the Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok County in Hungary. A third group descended from the medieval Alans are the Asud of Mongolia. Both the Jász and the Asud have long been assimilated; only the Ossetians have preserved a form of the Alanic language and Alanian identity.

The majority of Ossetians are Eastern Orthodox Christians, with sizable minorities professing the Ossetian ethnic religion of Uatsdin as well as Islam.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ossetians&quot; and &quot;Ossetia&quot; comes from the Russians, who borrowed the Georgian term &#x27; (ოსეთი – note the personal pronoun), which means &#x27;the land of the Osi&#x27;. In Georgian, &#x27; (ოსი, &#x27;, ოსები) has been used since the Middle Ages to refer to the only Iranian-speaking group in the Central Caucasus. The word likely derives from the old Sarmatian self-designation &quot;As&quot; (pronounced &quot;Az&quot;) or &quot;Iasi&quot; (pronounced &quot;Yazi&quot;), which is cognate to the Hungarian &#x27;. Both forms trace back to the Latin &#x27;, itself a Latinization of the Sarmatian tribal name *&quot;Yazig&quot; used by the Alans. This name comes from the Proto-Iranian root *&#x27;, meaning “&#x27;those who sacrifice&#x27;, possibly indicating a tribe associated with ritual sacrifice. Meanwhile, the broader Sarmatians apparently referred to themselves as &quot;Ariitai&quot; or &quot;Aryan&quot;, a term preserved in modern Ossetic as &quot;&quot;.

Since Ossetian speakers lacked any single inclusive name for themselves in their native language beyond the traditional Iron–Digoron subdivision, these terms came to be accepted by the Ossetians as an endonym even before their integration into the Russian Empire.

This practice was put into question by the new Ossetian nationalism in the early 1990s, when the dispute between the Ossetian subgroups of Digoron and Iron over the status of the Digor dialect made Ossetian intellectuals search for a new inclusive ethnic name. This, combined with the effects of the Georgian–Ossetian conflict, led to the popularization of &quot;Alania&quot;, the name of the medieval Sarmatian confederation, to which the Ossetians traced their origin and to the inclusion of this name into the official republican title of North Ossetia in 1994.

The root &quot;os/as&quot;- probably stems from an earlier *&quot;ows&quot;/&quot;aws&quot;-. This is suggested by the archaic Georgian root &quot;ovs&quot;- (cf. &quot;Ovsi&quot;, &quot;Ovseti&quot;), documented in the &quot;Georgian Chronicles&quot;; the long length of the initial vowel or the gemination of the consonant &quot;s&quot; in some forms (NPers. &quot;Ās&quot;, &quot;Āṣ&quot;; Lat. &quot;Aas&quot;, &quot;Assi&quot;); and by the Armenian ethnic name *&quot;Awsowrk&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Ōsur&quot;-), probably derived from a cognate preserved in the Jassic term &quot;*Jaszok&quot;, referring to the branch of the Iazyges Alanic tribe dwelling near modern Georgia by the time of Anania Shirakatsi (7th century AD).

==Subgroups==

*Iron in the east and south form a larger group of Ossetians. They speak Iron dialect, which in turn is divided into several subgroups: Alagirs, Kurtats, Tagaurs, Kudar, Tual, Urstual and Chsan.
**Kudar are the southern group of Ossetians.
**Tual are in the central part of Ossetia.
**Ksan are in the east of South Ossetia.
*Digor people in the west. Digors live in Digora district, Iraf district and some settlements in Kabardino-Balkaria and Mozdok district. They speak Digor dialect.
*Iasi, who settled in the Jászság region in Hungary during the 13th century. They spoke the extinct Jassic dialect.
*Asud, a nomadic clan from Mongolia of Alanic-Ossetian origin. They, like the Iasi, thoroughly assimilated, and it is unclear what type of Ossetic dialect they used to speak before adopting the Mongolian language.

==Culture==
===Mythology===

The native beliefs of the Ossetian people are rooted in their Sarmatian origin, which have been syncretized with a local variant of Folk Orthodoxy, in which some pagan gods have been converted into Christian saints. The Narts, the Daredzant, and the Tsartsiat, serve as the basic literature of folk mythology in the region.

===Music===
==== Genres ====
Ossetian folk songs are divided into 10 unique genres:

* Historic songs
* War songs
* Heroic songs
* Work songs
* Wedding songs
* Drinking songs
* Humorous songs
* Dance songs
* Romantic songs
* Lyrical songs

==== Instruments ====
Ossetians use the following Instruments in their music:

* String Instruments:
** Plucked strings:
*** &quot;Dyuuadæstænon&quot; – a twelve-stringed Harp
*** &quot;Fændyr&quot; – a Harp with two or three plucked strings
** Bowed strings
*** &quot;Hysyn&quot; – two or three string Fiddle
*** &quot;Hyyrnæg&quot; – is a double-bridged instrument, a kind of Cello

** Dala – Tambourine

==History==
===Pre-history (Early &quot;Alans&quot;)===
The Ossetians descend from the Iazyges tribe of the Sarmatians, an Alanic sub-tribe, which in turn split off from the broader Scythians itself. The Sarmatians were the only branch of the Alans to keep their culture in the face of a Gothic invasion (c. 200 AD) and those who remained built a great kingdom between the Don and Volga Rivers, according to Coon, &quot;The Races of Europe&quot;. Between 350 and 374 AD, the Huns destroyed the Alan kingdom and the Alan people were split in half. A few fled to the west, where they participated in the Barbarian Invasions of Rome, established short-lived kingdoms in Spain and North Africa and settled in many other places such as Orléans, France, Iași, Romania, Alenquer, Portugal and Jászberény, Hungary. The other Alans fled to the south and settled in the Caucasus, where they established their medieval kingdom of Alania.

===Middle Ages===


In the 8th century, a consolidated Alan kingdom, referred to in sources of the period as Alania, emerged in the northern Caucasus Mountains, roughly in the location of the latter-day Circassia and the modern North Ossetia–Alania. At its height, Alania was a centralized monarchy with a strong military force and had a strong economy that benefited from the Silk Road.

Alania reached its peak in the 11th century under the Alanian ruler Durgulel, who established relations with the Byzantine Empire.

After the Mongol invasions of the 1200s, the Alans migrated further into Caucasus Mountains, where they would form three ethnographical groups; the Iron, the Digoron and the Kudar. The Jassic people are believed to be a potentially fourth group that migrated in the 13th century to Hungary.

===Modern history===
In more-recent history, the Ossetians were involved in the Ossetian–Ingush conflict (1991–1992) and Georgian–Ossetian conflicts (1918–1920, early 1990s) and in the 2008 South Ossetia war between Georgia and Russia.

Key events:
*1774 — Expansion of the Russian Empire on Ossetian territory.
*1801 — After Russian annexation of the east Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, the modern-day territory of South Ossetia becomes part of the Russian Empire.
*in 1830, the Russian general Paul Andreas von Rennenkampff organized South Ossetian Expedition of 1830. 1,500 Russian troops besieged Ossetian towers in the village of Koshelta, where 30 Ossetian rebels were located.
*1922 — Creation of the South Ossetian autonomous oblast. North Ossetia remains a part of the Russian SFSR, while South Ossetia remains a part of the Georgian SSR.
*20 September 1990 – The independent Republic of South Ossetia is formed. Though it remained unrecognized, it detached itself from Georgia &quot;de facto&quot;. In the last years of the Soviet Union, ethnic tensions between Ossetians and Georgians in Georgia&#x27;s former Autonomous Oblast of South Ossetia (abolished in 1990) and between Ossetians and Ingush in North Ossetia evolved into violent clashes that left several hundred dead and wounded and created a large tide of refugees on both sides of the border.

Ever since &quot;de facto&quot; independence, there have been proposals in South Ossetia of joining Russia and uniting with North Ossetia.

==Language==
The Ossetian language belongs to the Eastern Iranian (Alanic) branch of the Indo-European language family.

Ossetian is divided into two main dialect groups: Ironian (os. – Ирон) in North and South Ossetia and Digorian (os. – Дыгурон) in Western North Ossetia. In these two groups are some subdialects, such as Tualian, Alagirian and Ksanian. The Ironian dialect is the most widely spoken.

Ossetian is among the remnants of the Scytho-Sarmatian dialect group, which was once spoken across the Pontic–Caspian Steppe. The Ossetian language is not mutually intelligible with any other Iranian language.

==Religion==

Prior to the 10th century, Ossetians were strictly pagan, though they were partially Christianized by Byzantine missionaries in the beginning of the 10th century. By the 13th century, most of the urban population of Ossetia gradually became Eastern Orthodox Christian as a result of Georgian missionary work.

Islam was introduced shortly after, during the 1500s and 1600s, when the members of the Digor first encountered Circassians of the Kabarday tribe in Western Ossetia, who themselves had been introduced to the religion by Tatars during the 1400s.

According to a 2013 estimate, up to 15% of North Ossetia’s population practice Islam.

In 1774, Ossetia became part of the Russian Empire, which only went on to strengthen Orthodox Christianity considerably, by having sent Russian Orthodox missionaries there. However, most of the missionaries chosen were churchmen from Eastern Orthodox communities living in Georgia, including Armenians and Greeks, as well as ethnic Georgians. Russian missionaries themselves were not sent, as this would have been regarded by the Ossetians as too intrusive.

Today, the majority of Ossetians from both North and South Ossetia follow Eastern Orthodoxy.

Assianism (&quot;Uatsdin&quot; or &quot;Aesdin&quot; in Ossetian), the Ossetian folk religion, is also widespread among Ossetians, with ritual traditions like animal sacrifices, holy shrines, annual festivities, etc. There are temples, known as &quot;kuvandon,&quot; in most villages. According to the research service &quot;Sreda&quot;, North Ossetia is the primary center of Ossetian Folk religion and 29% of the population reported practicing the Folk religion in a 2012 survey. Assianism has been steadily rising in popularity since the 1980s.

==Demographics==
The first data on the number of Ossetians dates back to 1742. According to the Georgian Archbishop Joseph, the number of Ossetians was approximately 200 thousand

Outside of South Ossetia, there are also a significant number of Ossetians living in Trialeti, in North-Central Georgia. A large Ossetian diaspora lives in Turkey and Syria. About 5,000–10,000 Ossetians emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, with their migration reaching peaks in 1860–61 and 1865. In Turkey, Ossetians settled in central Anatolia and set up clusters of villages around Sarıkamış and near Lake Van in eastern Anatolia. Ossetians have also settled in Belgium, France, Sweden, the United States (primarily New York City, Florida and California), Canada (Toronto), Australia (Sydney) and other countries all around the world.

===Russian Census of 2002===
The vast majority of Ossetians live in Russia (according to the Russian Census (2002)):

* North Ossetia–Alania — 445,300
* Moscow — 10,500
* Kabardino-Balkaria — 9,800
* Stavropol Krai — 7,700
* Krasnodar Krai — 4,100
* Karachay–Cherkessia — 3,200
* Saint Petersburg — 2,800
* Rostov Oblast — 2,600
* Moscow Oblast — 2,400

==Genetics==

The Ossetians are a unique ethnic group of the Caucasus, speaking an Indo-Iranian language surrounded mostly by Vainakh-Dagestani and Abkhazo-Circassian ethnolinguistic groups, as well as Turkic tribes such as the Karachays and the Balkars.

Like many other ethnolinguistic groups in the Caucasus, the genetic heritage of the Ossetians is both diverse yet distinctive. While Ossetians share genetic traits with neighboring populations, they have retained a distinct identity. With 70% of Ossetian males belonging to the Y-chromosomal haplogroup G2, specifically the G2a1a1a1a1a1b-FGC719 subclade. Among Iron people, this percentage rises to 72.6%, compared to 55.9% among Digor people.

This haplogroup has been identified in Alan burials associated with the Saltovo-Mayaki culture. In a 2014 study by V. V. Ilyinsky on bone fragments from ten Alanic burials along the Don River, DNA analysis was successfully performed on seven samples. Four of these belonged to Y-DNA Haplogroup G2, while six exhibited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup I. The shared Y-DNA and mtDNA among these individuals suggest they may have belonged to the same tribe or were close relatives. These findings strongly support the hypothesis of direct Alan ancestry for Ossetians. This evidence challenges alternative theories, such as Ossetians being Caucasian speakers assimilated by the Alans, reinforcing that Haplogroup G2 is central to their genetic lineage.

<text>Wisconsin was settled largely by European immigrants in the late 19th century. This immigration led to the popularization of galops, schottisches, waltzes, and, especially, polkas. Classical composers and conductors from Wisconsin include Hans Balatka, Hugo Kaun, Eugene Luening, and Theodore Steinmetz. Among Wisconsin&#x27;s contributions to rock music were Les Paul, an electric guitar pioneer known as the &quot;Wizard of Waukesha&quot;. The Steve Miller Band, with Milwaukee&#x27;s Steve Miller, had three #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from 1973 to 1982. The Chordettes from Sheboygan, Bon Iver from Eau Claire, and Garbage from Madison all had albums on the Billboard 200.

==Genres==

===Indigenous music===
===German- and Norwegian-American music===
The 1830s and 1840s brought European dances like the schottische, waltz, galop and, most importantly, the polka. The 1840s also saw massive immigration from Germany to Milwaukee, which became known as &quot;Deutsche Athen&quot; (&quot;German Athens&quot;). Groups formed, such as the Milwaukee Musical Society, to celebrate ethnic German music. Some important figures from this era include Christopher Bach, Hans Balatka, Eugene Luening and Hugo Kaun.

While Germans moved to Milwaukee and eastern Wisconsin, Norwegians moved &quot;en masse&quot; to southern and western Wisconsin, and surrounding areas. Norwegian musicians, such as the violinist Ole Bull, were popular in Madison.

New Glarus and Monroe saw a host of Swiss immigrants settle in the mid-1800s. Much like their German counterparts, these Swiss people established polka societies, many of which are still active today.

===Blues and jazz===
Musical output came from Grafton, Ozaukee County during the 1920s when Paramount Records released a series of blues and jazz recordings by artists from the South.

Waukesha&#x27;s Les Paul, enjoyed a long career as a blues, country, and jazz guitarist and musical innovator. known as the &quot;Wizard of Waukesha&quot; for his technological tinkering, was one of the pioneers of the solid-body electric guitar, helping to create the Gibson Les Paul and later the Gibson SG. Among the musicians he partnered with were his wife Mary Ford, with whom he recorded a version of How High the Moon in 1951. He also played with Jim Atkins, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters.

<doc id="307678" wikidata="Q191723" url="?curid=307678" title="Ferruginous duck">
<text>The ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), also known as ferruginous pochard, common white-eye or white-eyed pochard, is a medium-sized diving duck from Eurosiberia. The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek word, (), an unknown seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and the Russian word, (), the Russian word for pochard, which occurs in the bird&#x27;s Russian common name.

==Description==
The breeding male is a rich, dark chestnut on the head, breast and flanks with contrasting pure white undertail coverts. In flight the white belly and underwing patch are visible. The females are duller and browner than the males. The male has a yellow eye and the females have a dark eye.

==Habitat==
The ferruginous duck prefers quite shallow fresh waterbodies with rich submerged and floating vegetation with dense stands of emergent vegetation on the margins. In some areas it will use saline or brackish pools or wetlands. On passage and wintering will also frequent coastal waters, inland seas and large, open lagoons.

==Distribution==
The breeding range of the ferruginous duck is from Iberia and the Maghreb east to western Mongolia, south to Arabia, although in the west is now scarce and localised and locally extirpated in some countries. The duck winters throughout the Mediterranean Basin and the Black Sea, smaller number migrate into sub-Saharan Africa via the Nile Valley. Eastern birds winter in south and south-east Asia.

==Habits==
These are gregarious birds, but less social than other &quot;Aythya&quot; species but where common it can form large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks, such as tufted ducks and common pochards. Form pairs from January onwards and during courtship the male often curls his tail so that it dips into the water forming a triangular white patch of the undertail coverts. In areas where it is common it will form colonies at protected sites such as islands, often in association with gulls. Where scarce it nests singly, in dispersed and concealed sites.

Eggs are laid from the end of April or early May in a nest which is sited on the ground close to water, or sometimes a floating nest is built among emergent vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 25–27 days and the fledging period is 55–60 days.
These birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants with some molluscs, aquatic insects and small fish. They often feed at night, and will upend (dabble) for food as well as the more characteristic diving.

==Conservation==
The species is threatened by the degradation and destruction of its favoured habitats by anthropogenic causes which are very wide and varied including impoundment, drainage, pollution and mismanagement. The introduction of non-native species has also caused habitat degradation, e.g. the stocking of lakes with and accidental introduction of grass carp &quot;Ctenopharyngodon idella&quot; has caused reductions in plant and animal biomass available for the ducks to feed on. In addition, the increased threat of drought due to climate change may pose a threat to the species in the drier parts of its range. Increased disturbance by fishing boats and anglers among marginal vegetation could cause abandonment of the breeding sites or disrupt the timing of breeding particularly in populated areas, e.g. Western Europe. Ferruginous ducks are also threatened by hunting and large numbers are shot on passage in the autumn and in the wintering areas. Although protected in most European countries illegal and accidental hunting persists. It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Among recent local initiatives it should be mentioned inclusion of the breeding habitats of the species in Armenia into network of Emerald Sites protected by the Bern Convention.

<text>David Usher (born April 24, 1966) is a British-born Canadian musician, best-selling author, keynote speaker, and activist best known as the front man for the band Moist. He has also released a number of solo albums. He is the founder of Reimagine AI, an artificial intelligence creative studio.

==Early life==
David Usher was born in Oxford, England to Thai Buddhist artist Samphan Usher and Queen&#x27;s University economics professor Dan Usher. He has lived in various places such as Malaysia, New York City, California and Thailand since early childhood, before his family settled in Kingston, Ontario. He attended high school at Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute at the same time that Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip and Hugh Dillon of the Headstones attended the school. Usher attended Queen&#x27;s University for one semester before transferring to Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, majoring in political science.

==Career==
While studying in Vancouver, Usher helped form the band Moist, composed of Usher on vocals, Mark Makoway on guitars, Jeff Pearce on bass, Kevin Young, who, like Usher, had moved to Vancouver from Kingston, on keyboards, and Paul Wilcox on drums. Usher became the principal songwriter for the band.

Moist&#x27;s debut album &quot;Silver&quot; was released in 1994 and went on to achieve quadruple-platinum status, selling 400,000 copies in Canada. Their sophomore album, titled &quot;Creature&quot;, was released in 1996 and reached triple-platinum status, selling over 300,000 copies.

In 1998, Usher took a year to work on his own recordings. He released his first solo album, &quot;Little Songs&quot;. Most of the album was recorded in the kitchen of David&#x27;s apartment. The album contains a track titled &quot;Baby Skin Tattoo&quot;, which bears no relation to the song of the same name on the Moist album &quot;Creature.&quot;

In 1999, Moist released their third album, titled &quot;Mercedes 5 and Dime&quot;, once again achieving multi-platinum status. They followed this with a compilation album and DVD in 2001, titled &quot;Machine Punch Through: The Singles Collection&quot;, and thereafter entered a hiatus period that would last twelve years.

Usher continued with his solo career, releasing his second solo album, &quot;Morning Orbit&quot;, which sold 90,000 copies. The song &quot;Alone in the Universe&quot; was released as the first single, and the album featured collaborations with some members of Moist and with several figures of the Canadian music scene including Jagori Tanna and Bruce Gordon of I Mother Earth, Gord Sinclair of The Tragically Hip, and the rapper Snow. The album also included a cover of the Tracy Chapman song &quot;Fast Car&quot;. A Thai version of the record was released, and included Usher singing in Thai on two of the tracks.

Usher&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Hallucinations&quot;, came out in 2003, and includes a cover of the Manic Street Preachers song &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot;.

&quot;Hallucinations&quot; was followed by &quot;If God Had Curves&quot;, which includes collaborations with Tegan Quin of Tegan and Sara, and Bruce Cockburn.

Usher continued to release solo albums throughout the first decade of the 2000s, with &quot;Strange Birds&quot; (2007) and &quot;Wake Up and Say Goodbye&quot; (2008). &quot;Strange Birds&quot; contains themes inspired by New York City, where Usher had moved with his family. It also includes extensive collaborations with other members of Moist. &quot;Wake Up and Say Goodbye&quot; includes a bonus track featuring Quebec-based singer Marie-Mai, and the album was nominated for a Juno Award.

In the early 2010s, David Usher released two more solo albums before reforming the band Moist. &quot;The Mile End Sessions&quot; came out in 2010, and &quot;Songs from the Last Day on Earth&quot; in 2012. &quot;The Mile End Sessions&quot; is composed mostly of previously released songs re-recorded in acoustic arrangements, is produced by Moist member Jonathan Gallivan, contains Usher&#x27;s first French-language recording, and features contributions from Marie-Mai and Cœur de pirate. &quot;Songs from the Last Day on Earth&quot; is also produced by Jonathan Gallivan.

In 2013, Moist returned from a twelve-year hiatus and recorded their fourth studio album, &quot;Glory Under Dangerous Skies&quot;, the following year.

In 2016, Usher released his ninth solo studio album, titled &quot;Let It Play&quot;. The album features English translations of French-Canadian songs, re-recorded originals from Usher&#x27;s repertoire, as well as high-profile collaborations with artists such as Marie-Mai, Alex Nevsky, Monogrenade, Karim Ouellet, Dumas, Ingrid St-Pierre, Caracol, Daniel Lavoie, Dominique A, and Baden Baden.

Throughout his musical career, Usher has sold more than 1.4 million albums, won four Juno Awards and had several #1 singles singing in English, French, and Thai.

Usher is also the founder of Reimagine AI, an artificial intelligence creative studio based out of Montreal. Reimagine AI integrates interactive and AI technology to build virtual beings.

Usher is the co-creator (with Damon Matthews) of the Climate Clock. Climateclock.net 

In 2012 Usher made a presentation about the creative process at the Mesh Marketing conference in Toronto. In 2015 he published a book on creativity and the creative process, titled &quot;Let the Elephants Run • Unlock Your Creativity and Change Everything&quot;.

==Personal life==
He is featured in the 2001 MuchMusic special &quot;Musicians in the WarZone&quot;, a humanitarian documentary directed by filmmaker Liz Marshall, in which he journeys to the northern border of Thailand to visit a large Burmese refugee community.

As of 2018, he lives in Montreal, Quebec, with his family.

<doc id="307680" wikidata="Q4907518" url="?curid=307680" title="Superior (hierarchy)">
<text>In a hierarchy or tree structure of any kind, a superior is an individual or position at a higher level in the hierarchy than another (a &quot;subordinate&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot;), and thus closer to the apex. 

== General ==

A superior generally has the power to approve or deny requests from subordinates, within the scope of the relevant organization. The superior may control the careers of subordinates; for instance, they may have the authority to give raises or promotions.

Superiors are given sometimes supreme authority over others under their command. When an order is given, one must follow that order and obey it or punishment may be issued.

==By organization==
Superiors in different organizations may have different titles, roles, and responsibilities.

===Business===

In business, superiors are people who are supervisors.

===Military===

In the military, superiors are people who are higher in the chain of command (superior officer). 

===Catholic Church===

A is the person to whom a cleric is immediately responsible under canon law. For monks, it would be the abbot (or the abbess for nuns); for friars, it would be the prior, or, for Franciscans, the guardian (&quot;custos&quot;), for Minims, the corrector; for diocesan priests, it would be the local bishop. In religious orders with a hierarchy above the local community, there will also be superiors general and possibly provincial superiors above the local abbot, prior, or mother superior. The priest in charge a mission &quot;sui iuris&quot; is called an ecclesiastical superior.

<text>Host desecration is a form of sacrilege in Christian denominations that follow the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. It involves the mistreatment or malicious use of a consecrated host—the bread used in the Eucharistic service of the Divine Liturgy or Mass (also known by Protestants simply as Communion bread). It is forbidden by the Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Orthodox Churches, as well as in certain Protestant traditions (including Anglicanism, Lutheranism, and Methodism). In Catholicism, where the host is held to have been transubstantiated into the body of Jesus Christ, host desecration is one of the gravest sins. Intentional host desecration incurs the penalty of excommunication . Throughout history, a number of groups have been accused of desecrating the Eucharist, often with grave consequences due to the spiritual importance of the consecrated host.

Accusations against Jews were a common reason given for massacres and expulsions throughout the Middle Ages in Europe. Similar accusations were made against Muslims, Protestants and in witchcraft trials; witch-hunter&#x27;s guides such as the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; refer to hosts as being objects of desecration by witches. It is part of many descriptions of the Black Mass, both in ostensibly historical works and in fiction.

==Background==
In the Catholic Church, the transubstantiation of the Eucharist means the &quot;body, blood, soul, and divinity&quot; of Jesus Christ are present in the form of the consecrated host and adored. Theft, sale, or use of the host for a profane purpose is considered a grave sin and sacrilege, which incurs the penalty of excommunication, which is imposed automatically in the Latin Church (See Latin Church Code canon 1367, or Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches canon 1442.)

Some denominations, especially Lutherans, have similar beliefs regarding the Eucharist and the Real Presence, though they reject the Roman Catholic concept of transubstantiation, preferring instead the doctrine of the sacramental union, in which &quot;the body and blood of Christ are so truly united to the bread and wine of the Holy Communion that the two may be identified. They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine…in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith.&quot; Both the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Church, insist &quot;on the of the change from bread and wine into the body and the blood of Christ at the consecration of the elements&quot;, although they have &quot;never attempted to explain the of the change&quot;, thus rejecting philosophical terms to describe it.

The Methodist Church similarly holds that Jesus is truly present in the Eucharist &quot;through the elements of bread and wine&quot;, but maintains that how he is present is a Holy Mystery. Until the 19th-century Oxford Movement reintroduced the classic doctrine of the Real Presence, Anglicanism had favored receptionism — the doctrine that while the bread and wine in the Eucharist continue to exist unchanged after consecration, the faithful communicant receives together with them the body and blood of Jesus. Whatever the doctrine selected, among Anglicans the consecrated bread and hosts are reserved and treated with great reverence.

Since the publication of in 1969, the Catholic Church has allowed certain countries to allow communicants to receive the Host in the hand, rather than directly onto the tongue, reviving an &quot;ancient custom&quot;. Communion in the hand is now widespread in many parts of the world. The practice means that access to consecrated Hosts is easier than in the past, since the person receiving it in the hand may pretend to place it in their mouth for consumption. About this, Pope Benedict XVI cited: &quot;I am not opposed in principle to Communion in the hand; I have both administered and received Communion in this way myself… The idea behind my current practice of having people kneel to receive Communion on the tongue was to send a signal and to underscore the Real Presence with an exclamation point&quot; Receiving on the tongue is still the official norm of the Catholic Church, while receiving in the hand [via the indult] is, in English-speaking countries, the practical norm. Kneeling to receive communion is still the norm among Anglicans and Lutherans.

, host desecration is a crime in Spain, and in the 1983 Code of Canon Law.

==Medieval accusations against Jews==

Accusations of host desecration () leveled against Jews were a common pretext for massacres and expulsions throughout the Middle Ages in Europe. The libel of &quot;Jewish deicide&quot;—that the Jewish people were responsible for the killing of Jesus, whom Christians regard as God become man—was a generally accepted Christian belief. It was spuriously claimed that Jews stole hosts (objects to which they attached no significance, religious or otherwise), and further spuriously claimed that they abused these hosts to re-enact the crucifixion of Jesus by stabbing or burning them.

It has been asserted by modern scholars, such as the Catholic priest Gavin Langmuir, that these accusations against Jews represented profound doubt about the truth of Christianity. Although the doctrine of transubstantiation did not imply that, by consuming the host, Christians were eating flesh and drinking blood in the normal sense, the language used to describe the dogma would have been interpreted as completely alien to Judaism and Jewish law. For Jews, such a belief system would contradict their strict dietary laws, which forbid the consumption of blood, even when consuming kosher animals.

Jews in the Middle Ages were frequently victims of similar accusations, considered more serious than desecration of other revered items, such as relics or images of Jesus and the saints. The accusations were often supported only by the testimony of the accuser, who may potentially bear a prejudice against the accused Jew or the Jewish people. Despite this, some alleged perpetrators were tried and found guilty, on little evidence or through torture.

The penalties for Jews accused of defiling sacred hosts were severe. Many Jews, after accusations and torture, &quot;confessed&quot; to abusing hosts, and the accused Jews were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews in the community, as happened in Beelitz in 1243, in Prague in 1389, and in many German cities, according to Ocker&#x27;s writings in the &quot;Harvard Theological Review&quot;. According to William Nichol, over 100 instances of Jews pleading guilty to the desecration of sacred hosts have been recorded.
The first recorded accusation was made in 1243 at Beelitz, south of Potsdam. Tradition records that as a consequence the Jews of Beelitz were burned on a hill before the Mill Gate, which was subsequently, and until 1945, called the Judenberg, although there is no contemporary evidence for the burnings in documents of the 13th century. Another famous case that took place in 1290, in Paris, was commemorated in the Church of the Rue des Billettes and in a local confraternity. The case of 1337, at Deggendorf, celebrated locally as part of the until 1992, led to a series of massacres across the region. In 1370 in Brussels the charge of host desecration, linked to an actual recovered relic of desecrated hosts currently found in the Cathedral of St. Gudula and long celebrated in a special feast, and to artistic depictions also found in the cathedral, led to the burning of six Jews (other times given twenty) and, reportedly, the expulsion of the town&#x27;s Jewish population (see Brussels massacre). In 1510, at Knoblauch in Havelland 38 Jews were executed and more expelled from Brandenburg.

An alleged host desecration in 1410, at Segovia, was said to have brought about an earthquake; as a result, leading Jews in the city were executed and the local synagogue was seized and re-dedicated as the convent and Church of Corpus Christi.

Similar accusations, resulting in extensive persecution of Jews, were brought forward in 1294, at Laa, Austria; 1298, at Röttingen, near Würzburg, and at Korneuburg, near Vienna; 1299, at Ratisbon; 1306, at St. Pölten; 1330, at Güstrow; 1338, at Pulkau; 1388, at Prague; 1401, at Glogau; 1420, at Enns; 1453, at Breslau; 1478, at Passau; 1492, at Sternberg, in Mecklenburg; 1514, at Mittelberg, in Alsace; 1556, at Sochaczew, in Poland. The last Jew burned for stealing a host died in 1631, according to Jacques Basnage, quoting from Menasseh Ben Israel. In some cases host desecration legends emerged without actual accusations, as was the case of the host desecration legend of Poznan (Posen).

The accusation of host desecration gradually ceased after the Reformation as more Christian denominations no longer believe in hosts being the body and blood of Christ. However, sporadic instances of host desecration libel occurred even in the 18th and 19th century. In 1761 in Nancy, several Jews from Alsace were executed on a charge of sacred host desecration. The last recorded accusation was brought up in Berlad, Romania, in 1836.

==Medieval accusations against Muslims==
Juan Manuel included in his 1335 anthology &quot;El Conde Lucanor&quot; a tale about a treacherous priest who gave the Host to some Muslims, who then proceeded to drag it through the mud while mocking it. In 1465, Christians who opposed King Enrique IV of Castile defamed him by claiming that under his reign, &quot;some Jews and Moors sought on several occasions to obtain a consecrated host&quot; as well as other sacred objects &quot;in order to perform various evil rites to harm our Lord, his holy church, and our faith.&quot; Sixteenth-century inquisitors and polemicists likewise accused former Muslims, whom they saw as false converts, of host desecration. For example, the Inquisition of Cuenca charged one former Muslim with purchasing stolen hosts and stringing them up in a latrine (as some former Judaists supposedly did). In a similar accusation, former Muslims allegedly stole a church&#x27;s hosts and contemptuously threw them onto the ground.

==Accusations against Protestants==
Since 1549, Counter-Reformers occasionally accused Protestants of desecrating the Host. For example, a Catholic account claims that in 1561 a group of French Protestants were so irritated by a church&#x27;s bell-ringing that they responded by assaulting the church, harming and killing several parishioners, and intentionally desecrating the Host.

==2008 controversy in the US==
In his July 8 blog entry, University of Minnesota Morris biology professor Paul Zachary Myers criticized the reaction to a University of Central Florida student&#x27;s perceived act of host desecration (the student had attempted to bring the host to a friend who was curious about communion). Myers described the level of harassment against the student and expressed his intent to desecrate the host, which the Catholic Church considers a grave matter.

Myers expressed outrage that Fox News appeared to be inciting viewers to cause further problems for the student and ridiculed reports that armed guards would attend the next Mass. Myers suggested that if any of his readers could acquire some consecrated Eucharistic hosts for him, he would treat the wafers &quot;with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web.&quot;

A number of Catholics immediately reacted strongly. William A. Donohue of the Catholic League accused Myers of anti-Catholic bigotry, described his proposal as a threat to desecrate what Catholics hold to be the Body of Christ and sent a letter asking the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature to take action against Myers.

Myers pierced a host with a rusty nail, which he also used to pierce a few ripped-out pages of the Quran and &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, put them all in the trash along with old coffee grounds and a banana peel. He provided a photograph on his blog of these items in the garbage and wrote that nothing must be held sacred, encouraging people to question everything. In addition, he described the history of allegations of host desecration, emphasizing the frequent use of such allegations in medieval Europe to justify anti-Semitism.

According to Donohue, as the &quot;Pharyngula&quot; website was accessible via a link from the University of Minnesota website, it should be bound by the institution&#x27;s code of conduct which requires faculty to be &quot;respectful, fair and civil&quot; when dealing with others. Subsequently, Myers explained to the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; that while his post was &quot;satire and protest&quot;, he had received death threats regarding the incident but was not taking them too seriously. The University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) Chancellor defended Myers, and stated: &quot;I believe that behaviors that discriminate against or harass individuals or groups on the basis of their religious beliefs are reprehensible&quot; and that the school &quot;affirms the freedom of a faculty member to speak or write as a public citizen without institutional discipline or restraint.&quot;

==&quot;Al-Islam&quot; magazine==

In 2009, two Muslim reporters from &quot;Al-Islam&quot;, a small Malaysian magazine, participated in a Catholic Mass, while undercover writing an article on cases of apostasy from Islam () and received Holy Communion. The reporters afterwards spat out the host and photographed it to prove they had not apostatised themselves. The resulting photo was then published in their May 2009 edition. The magazine, which is owned by Utusan Karya, part of the Utusan Malaysia Group, sent its reporters, including Muhd Ridwan Abdul Jalil, to two churches in the Klang Valley, as part of a special investigative report. The act of desecration occurred at St Anthony&#x27;s Church in Jalan Robertson, Kuala Lumpur.

After its publication, two lay Catholics from Penang, Sudhagaran Stanley and Joachim Francis Xavier, jointly lodged a police report against the reporters. The police took no action despite a potential charge under Section 298A (1) of the Penal Code for causing disharmony, disunity or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will, or prejudicing the maintenance of harmony or unity, on grounds of religion.

The desecration caused widespread outrage and condemnation from non-Muslims as well as Muslims across the country. Parties including the Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur, Murphy Pakiam; the Catholic Lawyers Society; as well as numerous editorials in the media, criticised the government and the Attorney-General for its failure to act.

Some nine months later, in early March 2010, &quot;Al-Islam&quot; published an apology to the Catholic Church and other Christians for the article. It was posted on the website of its publisher. Archbishop Pakiam, who is also president of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, accepted the apology and said that no further (legal) action would be taken.

==During a Black Mass==
A Black Mass is a Satanic ritual designed to satirize or invert a traditional Catholic mass. Consecrated hosts are a common ingredient in black masses, becoming the subject of desecration. The hosts must first be stolen from the tabernacle of a Catholic church, and/or secreted away by people who are posing as parishioners receiving communion.

In 2014, the Dakhma of Angra Mainyu held a public Black Mass at the Oklahoma Civic Center and planned to include the desecration of a consecrated host, which was to be &quot;stomped on&quot;. Instead, the host was returned through an attorney after the archdiocese filed a lawsuit for its recovery.

== Veracity ==
The sacrilege of the host is mistakenly regarded as a fictitious crime committed primarily by pagans and fringe groups. Recent research indicates that hosts were actually desecrated, especially in connection with war crimes, which was particularly the case when the aim was to expose as idolatrous the enemy&#x27;s religious cult, whose altars and churches were demonstratively vandalized. Since the host had a very special ideological meaning within a culture of giving, the opponent was not only to be dishonored materially, but also spiritually.

<text>The red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) is a large diving duck. The scientific name is derived from Greek &quot;Netta&quot; &quot;duck&quot;, and Latin &quot;rufina&quot;, &quot;golden-red&quot; (from &quot;rufus&quot;, &quot;ruddy&quot;). Its breeding habitat is lowland marshes and lakes in southern Europe and it extends from the steppe and semi-desert areas on the Black Sea to Central Asia and Mongolia, wintering in the Indian Subcontinent and Africa. It is somewhat migratory, and northern birds winter further south into north Africa.

The adult male is unmistakable. It has a rounded orange head, red bill and black breast. The flanks are white, the back brown, and the tail black. The female is mainly a pale brown, with a darker back and crown and a whitish face. Eclipse males are like females but with red bills. They are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks, such as common pochards. They feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants, and typically upend for food more than most diving ducks.

A wheezing call can be given by the male. Series of hoarse &quot;vrah-vrah-vrah&quot; calls can also be heard from females.

Red-crested pochards build nests by the lakeside among vegetation and lay 8–12 pale green eggs. The birds&#x27; status in the British Isles is much confused because there have been many escapes and deliberate releases over the years, as well as natural visitors from the continent. However, it is most likely that they are escapees that are now breeding wild and have built up a successful feral population. They are most numerous around areas of England including Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire and also spotted in Leicestershire.

The red-crested pochard is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

Originally raised in Lincoln Heights, near Cincinnati, The Isley Brothers are an R&amp;B, soul music and funk group. They have had a notably long-running success on the Billboard charts and are the only act to chart in the Top 40 in six separate decades. In 2006, their most recent release became their ninth album to reach the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. Over the years, the act has performed in a variety of genres, including doo-wop, R&amp;B, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, soul, funk, disco, urban adult contemporary and hip-hop soul. The group has gone through several lineups, ranging from a quartet to a trio to a sextet; they are currently a duo. The original group consisted of the three elder sons of O&#x27;Kelly Isley, Sr. and Sally Bell Isley: O&#x27;Kelly Jr., Rudolph and Ronald, who formed in 1954 and recorded with small labels singing doo-wop and rock and roll. After modest success with singles such as &quot;Shout&quot;, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and the Motown single &quot;This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)&quot;, and a brief tenure with Jimi Hendrix as a background guitar player, the group settled on a brand of gritty soul and funk defined by the Grammy-winning smash &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; in 1969.

In spite of the record&#x27;s success, the group was considering quitting the music business until Gamble &amp; Huff, a team of producers and songwriters, took an interest in the group. With Gamble &amp; Huff, the O&#x27;Jays emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with &quot;Back Stabbers&quot; (1972), a pop hit, and topped the U.S. Hot 100 singles charts the following year with &quot;Love Train&quot;.

<text>Naked Lunch is a 1991 surrealist science fiction drama film written and directed by David Cronenberg and starring Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Ian Holm, and Roy Scheider. It is an adaptation of William S. Burroughs&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, and an international co-production of Canada, Britain, and Japan.

The film was released on 27 December 1991 in the United States by 20th Century Fox, and 24 April 1992 in the United Kingdom by First Independent Films. It received positive reviews from critics, but was a box office flop, grossing only $2.6million against a $17–18million budget due to a limited release. It won numerous honours, including the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Director and seven Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; has since become a cult film, acclaimed for its surrealistic visual and thematic elements.

==Plot==
In 1953, exterminator William Lee finds that his wife Joan is stealing his insecticide to use as a recreational drug. Lee is arrested by the police, and he begins hallucinating due to exposure to the insecticide. 

Lee believes he is a secret agent, and his boss, a giant talking beetle, tasks him with killing Joan, who is an agent of &quot;Interzone Incorporated.&quot; Lee dismisses the beetle&#x27;s instructions and kills it. Lee returns home to find Joan having sex with Hank, one of his writer friends. Shortly afterwards, he attempts to shoot a drinking glass off her head to emulate William Tell, and accidentally kills her.

Having inadvertently accomplished his &quot;mission,&quot; Lee flees to Interzone in North Africa. He spends his time writing reports concerning his mission; these documents are eventually compiled into the titular book. 

While Lee is addicted to assorted mind-altering substances, his replacement typewriter, a Clark Nova, becomes a talking insect. It tells him to find Dr. Benway by seducing Joan Frost, a doppelgänger of his dead wife. There is a row at gunpoint with Joan&#x27;s husband Tom, after Lee steals his typewriter, which is then destroyed by the Clark Nova insect. Lee also encounters Yves Cloquet, who is apparently an attractive young gay Swiss gentleman. Lee later discovers that Yves is merely a human disguise, and that his true form is a huge shapeshifting centipede.

Lee concludes that Dr. Benway is secretly masterminding a narcotics operation for a drug called &quot;black meat&quot; supposedly derived from the guts of giant Brazilian centipedes. He encounters Tom&#x27;s housekeeper Fadela, previously observed to be an agent of the narcotics operation. Fadela reveals herself as Dr. Benway in disguise. After being recruited as a double agent for the black meat operation, Lee completes his report and flees Interzone to Annexia with Joan Frost.

Stopped by the Annexian border patrol and instructed to prove his claim to be a writer, Lee produces a pen, but this proves insufficient for passage. Lee, having realized that accidentally murdering his wife has driven him to become a writer, demonstrates his William Tell routine using a glass atop Joan&#x27;s head. He again misses and kills Joan. The border guards cheerfully welcome him to Annexia, and his new life as a writer. Lee sheds a tear at this bittersweet accomplishment.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Filmmakers, including Stanley Kubrick and Antony Balch, using a script from Brion Gysin, attempted to adapt William S. Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; into a film, but were unsuccessful. In 1981, Cronenberg was interviewed by &quot;Omni&quot; during the release of &quot;Scanners&quot; in the United States and stated that he was interested in making a film based on Burroughs&#x27;s novel. Producer Jeremy Thomas met Cronenberg at the 1984 Toronto Festival of Festivals and discussed making a film adaption of the novel. Burroughs, Cronenberg, Thomas, James Grauerholz, and Hercules Bellville met in Tangiers in 1985. Grauerholz showed Cronenberg&#x27;s films to Burroughs and Cronenberg stated that Burroughs felt he was the only one who could properly make the film.

The screenplay for &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is based not only on Burroughs&#x27;s novel, but also on other fiction by him, and autobiographical accounts of his life. Cronenberg said it was necessary to &quot;Throw the book away&quot; as a direct adaptation would have been far too expensive and &quot;would be banned in every country in the world.&quot;

Burroughs was uninvolved with the writing of the film&#x27;s script and granted his blessing to the first draft in December 1989. This version opened the film with a short story from Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Exterminator!&quot;.

The shooting of Joan Lee is based on the 1951 death of Joan Vollmer, Burroughs&#x27;s common-law wife. Burroughs shot and killed Vollmer in a drunken game of &quot;William Tell&quot; at a party in Mexico City. He would later flee to the United States. Burroughs was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; of homicide and sentenced to two years, which were suspended. Burroughs stated in the introduction to his book &quot;Queer&quot; that Joan&#x27;s death was the starting point of his literary career, saying: &quot;I am forced to the appalling conclusion that I would have never become a writer but for Joan&#x27;s death&quot;.

The film was initially backed by Japanese investors, but they withdrew and Thomas replaced them with financing from Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation.

Peter Weller, who was working on &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;, asked Mark Irwin, who worked as the cinematographer on multiple Cronenberg films, what Cronenberg was working on. Irwin told Weller that he was adapting &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Weller was a fan of the novel since he first read it at age 18 and had read it ten times before learning of Cronenberg&#x27;s adaption. He stated that he pursued the lead role like &quot;a Pac-Man&quot;.

===Filming===
Cronenberg intended the film to be shot in Tangiers, but the Gulf War prevented him from filming in North Africa as they could not receive insurance. Cronenberg massively rewrote the script a few days before filming due to being unable to shoot in Tangiers. Cronenberg worked on the film while also starring in &quot;Nightbreed&quot;. The film was shot on a budget of around US$17 million and shooting started on 21 January 1991 in Toronto.

Chris Walas was hired to perform the special effects for the film. The film required fifty bug typewriters.

===Music===
The film score is composed by Cronenberg&#x27;s staple composer, Howard Shore, and features free jazz musician Ornette Coleman. The music of the Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar is also featured throughout the film. The use of Coleman&#x27;s composition &quot;Midnight Sunrise&quot;, recorded for his &quot;Dancing in Your Head&quot; album, is relevant, as author William S. Burroughs was present during the 1973 recording session.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Naked Lunch&quot; was released on 27 December 1991 in a limited release of 5 theaters, grossing $64,491 on its opening weekend. It went on to make $2,641,357 in North America. It was the second-highest grossing film in Canada for 1992, behind &quot;Léolo&quot;, having earned $600,000.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 70% rating based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Strange, maddening, and at times incomprehensible, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is nonetheless an engrossing experience.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;While I admired it in an abstract way, I felt repelled by the material on a visceral level. There is so much dryness, death and despair here, in a life spinning itself out with no joy&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;for the most part this is a coolly riveting film and even a darkly entertaining one, at least for audiences with steel nerves, a predisposition toward Mr. Burroughs and a willingness to meet Mr. Cronenberg halfway&quot;, but did praise Weller&#x27;s performance: &quot;The gaunt, unsmiling Mr. Weller looks exactly right and brings a perfect offhandedness to his disarming dialogue&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; gave a mixed review, calling it &quot;way too colorful - cute, in a repulsive way, with its crawly special effects - and tame compared with its source.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe criticized what he felt to be a &quot;lack of conviction&quot;.

&quot;Newsweek&quot;″s David Ansen wrote, &quot;Obviously this is not everybody&#x27;s cup of weird tea: you must have a taste for the esthetics of disgust. For those up to the dare, it&#x27;s one clammily compelling movie&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B+&quot; rating with Owen Gleiberman praising Weller&#x27;s performance: &quot;Peter Weller, the poker-faced star of &quot;RoboCop&quot;, greets all of the hallucinogenic weirdness with a doleful, matter-of-fact deadpan that grows more likable as the movie goes on. The actor&#x27;s steely robostare has never been more compelling. By the end, he has turned Burroughs&#x27;s stone-cold protagonist – a man with no feelings – into a mordantly touching hero&quot;.

In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, J. Hoberman wrote, &quot;Cronenberg has done a remarkable thing. He hasn&#x27;t just created a mainstream Burroughs on something approximating Burroughs&#x27;s terms, he&#x27;s made a portrait of an American writer&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum in his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote, &quot;David Cronenberg&#x27;s highly transgressive and subjective film adaptation of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; ... may well be &quot;the&quot; most troubling and ravishing head movie since &quot;Eraserhead&quot;. It is also fundamentally a film about writing – even &quot;the&quot; film about writing&quot;.

Burroughs scholar Timothy S. Murphy found the film to be a muddled adaptation that reflects Cronenberg&#x27;s mind more than the novel: he feels that Burroughs&#x27;s subversive, allegorically political depiction of drugs and homosexuality becomes merely aesthetic. Murphy argues that Burroughs&#x27;s social and politically situated literary techniques become in the film merely the hallucination of a junkie, and that by using the life of Burroughs himself as a framing narrative, Cronenberg turns a fragmented, unromantic, bitterly critical and satirical novel into a conventional bildungsroman.

&quot;Naked Lunch&quot; received a Criterion Collection DVD release in 2003, the first film by Cronenberg to do so.

===Accolades===
At the 13th Genie Awards, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; received 11 nominations and was perceived as being in an unusually tight competition with Jean-Claude Lauzon&#x27;s &quot;Léolo&quot;. The film also competed for the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.

==Legacy==
In 1994, English electronic musician Bomb the Bass released the single &quot;Bug Powder Dust&quot; which opens with the quote &quot;I think it&#x27;s time to discuss your, uh, philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavour&quot; and closes with the quote &quot;I think it&#x27;s time for you boys to share my last taste of the true black meat: the flesh of the giant aquatic Brazilian centipede.&quot; The song also includes various other quotes, items and themes from the film woven into the lyrics.

In a 1996 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart on the Road&quot;, Bart, Nelson, and Milhouse use Bart&#x27;s fake driver&#x27;s license to get into the theatre to see an adult film. The film they choose, based on its title and R rating, is &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. When they silently exit the theatre, Nelson looks up to the marquee and says, &quot;I can think of at least two things wrong with that title.&quot;

<doc id="307694" wikidata="Q83020448" url="?curid=307694" title="European shag">
<text>The European shag or common shag (Gulosus aristotelis) is a species of cormorant. It is the only member of the monotypic genus Gulosus. It breeds around the rocky coasts of western and southern Europe, southwest Asia and north Africa, mainly wintering in its breeding range except for the northernmost birds. In Britain this seabird is usually referred to as simply the shag. The scientific genus name derives from the Latin for glutton. The species name &quot;aristotelis&quot; commemorates the Greek philosopher Aristotle. 

== Taxonomy ==
The European shag was formerly classified within the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, but a 2014 study found it to be significantly more diverged than the clade containing &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; and &quot;Urile&quot;, but basal to the clade containing &quot;Nannopterum&quot; and &quot;Leucocarbo&quot;, and thus classified it in its own genus, &quot;Gulosus&quot;. The IOC followed this classification in 2021. &quot;Gulosus&quot; is thought to have split from the &quot;Nannopterum&quot;-&quot;Leucocarbo&quot; clade between 9.0–11.2 million years ago&quot;.&quot;

==Subspecies==
There are three subspecies:
* &quot;G. a. aristotelis&quot; – : nominate, found in northwestern Europe (Atlantic Ocean coasts)
* &quot;G. a. desmarestii&quot; – : found in southern Europe, southwest Asia (Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts)
* &quot;G. a. riggenbachi&quot; – : found in northwest African coast
The subspecies differ slightly in bill size and the breast and leg colour of young birds. Recent evidence suggests that birds on the Atlantic coast of southwest Europe are distinct from all three, and may be an as-yet undescribed subspecies.

The name shag is also used in the Southern Hemisphere for several additional species of cormorants.

==Description==
This is a medium-large black bird, long and with a wingspan. It has a longish tail and a yellow throat patch. Adults have a small crest in the breeding season. It is distinguished from the great cormorant by its smaller size, lighter build, thinner bill, and, in breeding adults, by the crest and metallic green-tinged sheen on the feathers. Among those differences are that a shag is smaller and has a lighter, narrower beak, and the juvenile shag has darker underparts. The European shag&#x27;s tail has 12 feathers, as do the great cormorant&#x27;s 14 feathers. The green sheen on the feathers results in the alternative name green cormorant sometimes being given to the European shag.

==Biology==
It feeds in the sea, and, unlike the great cormorant, is rare inland. It will winter along any coast that is well-supplied with fish.
The European shag is one of the deepest divers among the cormorant family. Using depth gauges, European shags recorded diving up to deep. European shags are preponderantly benthic zone feeders, i.e. they find their prey on the sea bottom. They will eat a wide range of fish but their commonest prey is the sand eel. Shags will travel many kilometres from their roosting sites in order to feed.

In UK coastal waters, dive times are typically around 20 to 45 seconds, with a recovery time of around 15 seconds between dives; this is consistent with aerobic diving, i.e. the bird depends on the oxygen in its lungs and dissolved in its bloodstream during the dive. When they dive, they jump out of the water first to give extra impetus to the dive.

It breeds on coasts, nesting on rocky ledges or in crevices or small caves. The nests are untidy heaps of rotting seaweed or twigs cemented together by the bird&#x27;s own guano. The nesting season is long, beginning in late February but some nests are not started until May or even later. Three eggs are laid. Their chicks hatch without down and so they rely totally on their parents for warmth, often for a period of two months before they can fly. Fledging may occur at any time from early June to late August, exceptionally to mid-October.

==Diet==
The shag is a pursuit-diving seabird that feeds predominantly in benthic habitats. Due to the relative ease with which diet samples can be collected from this species (regurgitated food or pellets) and the perceived conflict between the Phalacrocoracidae and fisheries, shag diet competition has been the subject of substantial scientific interest. Evidence collected at one colony, the Isle of May, Scotland, between 1985 and 2014, suggests that shag chick diet composition in this population has diversified in response to ocean warming. Shags also feed on fewer sandeel on windy days, presumably due to the strong effect of wind on flight in this species. The year-round diet of full-grown shags at this colony has also changed over the past 3 decades, from sandeel specialists to an increasingly diverse prey base.

==Distribution==
The European shag can be readily seen among the following locations during the breeding season, between late April and mid-July: Saltee Islands, Ireland; Farne Islands and Isles of Scilly, England; Isle of May, Deerness and Fowlsheugh, Scotland; Runde, Norway; Iceland; Denmark; Faroe Islands; Galicia, Northern Spain; Dalmatia and Istria, Croatia. In April 2017, eight new European shags were born in Monaco.

The British population was 18,000 pairs in 2015. The largest colony of European shags is in the Cíes Islands, Spain, with 2,500 pairs.

<text>Music of Missouri has a storied musical history. Missouri has had major developments in several popular music genres and has been the birthplace or career origin of many musicians. St. Louis was an important venue for early blues, jazz, country, and bluegrass. Kansas City has had famous performers such as Charlie Parker, Count Basie (New Jersey), Lester Young, and the distinct style of Kansas City jazz. Ragtime made influence in the city of Sedalia, Missouri, due to Scott Joplin and his publisher John Stark, and through Missouri native James Scott.

Rock and roll pioneers Big Joe Turner and Chuck Berry were born in Kansas City and St. Louis, respectively, and folk singer Ella Jenkins was born in St. Louis. Hillbilly music developed in the Ozarks of southern Missouri, and from 1955 to 1961, Springfield was home to some of the first national country music programs on American television. Since the 1980s, Branson, Missouri has emerged as a country music tourist mecca. In the 1990s, St. Louis area band Uncle Tupelo blended punk, rock, and country-influenced music styles with raucous performances and became pioneers of alt-country. Both St. Louis and Kansas City also have active hip-hop scenes; Tech N9ne was born in Kansas City and Eminem in St. Joseph, and Nelly and the St. Lunatics got their start in St. Louis. Sheryl Crow is from Kennett, Missouri and attended the University of Missouri School of Music. Sara Evans came from Howard County.

Country blues singer and songwriter Lottie Kimbrough was born in West Bottoms, Kansas City, Missouri.

==Classical==
The St. Louis Symphony is one of the oldest orchestras in the United States. The University of Missouri School of Music was established in 1917 in Columbia, Missouri and has thousands of alumni.

==Jazz==
Kansas City and St. Louis are &quot;cradles of jazz&quot; along with New Orleans, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York City.

Jazz artists from Missouri include Dixieland jazz and ragtime clarinetist, composer, and bandleader Wilbur Sweatman; trumpeter, saxophonist, accordionist, and bandleader Charlie Creath; bebop saxophonist and composer Charlie Parker; tenor saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, and Jimmy Forrest; pianist and bandleader Bennie Moten; trumpeters Shorty Baker, Clark Terry, Louis Metcalf, and Baikida Carroll; violinist Eddie South; alto saxophonist, arranger, and composer Lennie Niehaus; saxophonist, clarinetist, arranger, composer, and bandleader Oliver Nelson; clarinetist Pee Wee Russell; double bassist Wendell Marshall; trombonists Joseph Bowie and Melba Liston; alto saxophonists Luther Thomas and Jimmy Woods; saxophonist and composer Ahmad Alaadeen; guitarists Grant Green, Pat Metheny, and Norman Brown (Louisiana); drummer Phillip Wilson; organists Wild Bill Davis, Milt Buckner, and Charles Kynard; jazz fusion and smooth jazz musician Bob James ; and singers Anita O&#x27;Day and R&amp;B singer Oleta Adams.

St. Louis&#x27;s Gaslight Square entertainment district was an important area for jazz from the mid-1950s to 1960s. Jazz club Peacock Alley was the site of Miles Davis&#x27;s recording of &quot;Miles Davis Quintet at Peacock Alley&quot; in 1956. The Black Artists&#x27; Group was a multidisciplinary art collective in St. Louis from 1968 to 1972 that fostered jazz and the Black Arts Movement in the city. BAG inspired the foundation of Human Arts Ensemble.

By the 1920s, Kansas City was the geographical center of the vaudevillian Orpheum circuit, which included live music.

Kansas City jazz is a riff-based and blues-influenced sound developed in jam sessions in the crowded clubs of the 18th and Vine neighborhood. Many jazz musicians of the 1930s and 1940s lived or got started here, including Charlie Parker, Count Basie, and Lester Young. Kansas City jazz in the 1930s marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. The 1979 documentary &quot;The Last of the Blue Devils&quot; portrays this era in interviews and performances by local jazz figures. Kansas City Jazz Orchestra is big band style.

Due to this musical legacy, U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver said 18th and Vine is America&#x27;s third most recognized street after Broadway and Hollywood Boulevard. In 2018, UNESCO designated Kansas City its first and only City of Music in the US, in &quot;recognition of [Kansas City&#x27;s] investment and commitment to music, arts, and creativity as a driver of urban economic development&quot;, including the city&#x27;s budget for improving the 18th and Vine Jazz District in 2016.

==Soul/R&amp;B==
Ann Peebles, Fontella Bass, Angela Winbush, Barbara Carr, David Peaston, Jackie Ross, Reggie Young, Oleta Adams, Akon and SZA were from Missouri.

==Rock, heartland rock and metal==

Chuck Berry, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, James Pankow, Michael McDonald, and Sheryl Crow were from Missouri. The Urge came from St. Louis. Christofer Drew and his indie rock band Never Shout Never are from Joplin. Harlow from Kansas City signed to Greenworld records. Shaman&#x27;s Harvest is from Jefferson City. Prog metal band Anacrusis is from St. Louis. In 2005, rock band Living Things gained national attention after the release of their album &quot;Ahead of the Lions&quot;. Cavo is from St. Louis. Puddle of Mudd is from Kansas City. Story Of The Year from St. Louis is multi-platinum. Greek Fire (band) Spawning from Story Of The Year also from St. Louis.

==Hip-hop==
Tech N9ne from Kansas City helped popularize the chopper rap style in the late 1990s and co-founded the Strange Music label. Nelly from St. Louis had four #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits in the early 2000s, including &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; in 2002, and one with Murphy Lee. Metro Boomin from St. Louis has multiple #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits due to his production.

==Country==
Branson, Missouri is a popular tourist destination in the Ozarks of southwestern Missouri with an association with mainstream country music. The town&#x27;s popularity grew in the 1980s when a number of prominent country stars moved to the area, including Boxcar Willie, Sons of the Pioneers, and Roy Clark. Two major attractions had roots in the 1950s: the Shepherd of the Hills Theatre and Park, and Silver Dollar City. Modern music festivals in Branson include the Old-Time Fiddle Festival, Branson Jam, and the State of the Ozarks Fiddlers Convention. The largest music venue in Branson is the Grand Palace, which seats upwards of 4,000 people.

Prominent local attractions in Branson include entrepreneur and performer Jennifer Wilson, a regional celebrity known for her show at the Americana Theatre, the Mabe family&#x27;s Baldknobbers jamboree, which has been running for three generations, and Jim Owen of the &quot;Jim Owen Morning Show&quot;. The area&#x27;s country music broadcasting history, however, can be traced to nearby Springfield, Missouri in the mid-1930s, when Ralph D. Foster&#x27;s KWTO began carrying live performances and syndicating them to other stations across the country. The station&#x27;s most famous program was &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;, which, starting in 1955, was carried live on ABC-TV across the country. Foster became a major figure in the region&#x27;s music history; there is a museum named after him on the campus of the College of the Ozarks. Other national country music TV programs originating from Springfield included &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot; and &quot;Talent Varieties&quot;. Country singer Porter Wagoner and TV entertainer Speck Rhodes were from West Plains, Missouri. 

Branson&#x27;s place as a tourist destination was sparked in large part by the publication of the popular novel &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot; by Harold Bell Wright in 1907, which is set in the Branson area. It was the first novel in America to sell over a million copies, and readers flocked to Branson to see the places described in the book. The local music scene and a tourism industry developed as a result. Country pop singers such as Jerry Wallece, and Billy Swan were from Missouri. Other country singers from Missouri include Sara Evans, Chris Janson, Ferlin Husky, David Nail, and Billy Yates.

==Alt-country and indie rock==
===Mid-1980s===
In the mid-1980s, the Saint Louis area (and nearby southern Illinois) was home to garage rock band the Primitives and rock band the Blue Moons. The Blue Moons featured Festus native Mark Ortmann on drums and Brian Henneman.

===1990s===
The Primitives reorganized and transformed into Uncle Tupelo in the early 1990s. At the same time, Chicken Truck, an original outlaw country rock band, featuring Brian Henneman and drummer Mark Ortmann, was giving memorable performances in clubs such as Cicero&#x27;s. Chicken Truck reorganized and became the indie roots rock band the Bottle Rockets in 1992. A country cover band called Coffee Creek linked all of these upstart bands. Coffee Creek was composed of Jay Farrar, Brian Henneman, Mike Heidorn, and Jeff Tweedy.

Uncle Tupelo disbanded in 1994. Founding members of Uncle Tupelo formed Son Volt and Wilco after the split.

Bottle Rockets became known for their hit songs, &quot;Radar Gun&quot;, &quot;$1,000 Car&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Comin&#x27; Around&quot;. Their success led to appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; performing one of their original songs and being featured in a comedic sketch.

===2000s===
After extensive remodeling, Cicero&#x27;s, in the art district of University City, became what is currently known as Blueberry Hill&#x27;s Duck Room. Chuck Berry performed there frequently until 2014, and the venue hosts national touring rock music artists.

Angel Olsen is a folk and indie rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist who was raised in St. Louis. Nathaniel Rateliff was born in St. Louis and grew up in Hermann before initially relocating to Colorado to work with an evangelical ministry, after which he left religion and began pursuing music professionally.

<text>For many decades, Kansas has had a vibrant country and bluegrass scene. The Country Stampede Music Festival – one of the largest music festivals in the country – and the bluegrass/acoustic Walnut Valley Festival are testament to the continued popularity of these music genres in the state. Among current leading country artists, Martina McBride and Chely Wright are natives of Kansas.

The state has also fostered some rock acts – the one that is most associated with the state is almost certainly the band called Kansas. Some famous and pioneering jazz musicians also had roots in Kansas.

== History ==

The first music performed in the area that is now Kansas was that of the Indigenous peoples who lived there.

The earliest documented music comes after settlement by Anglo-Americans in the 1850s. One of the first musical works relating to Kansas was &quot;Ho! For the Kansas Plains&quot;, a song written by James G. Clark in the 1850s, which mythologized the territory as the site of abolitionist battles during the Bleeding Kansas era. A representative lyric was &quot;Ho! For the Kansas plains; Where men shall live in liberty; Free from the tyrant&#x27;s chains.&quot; Along the same lines, some versions of the famous Civil War marching song &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; refer to John Brown&#x27;s abolitionist activities in Kansas Territory during the same era.

Following the Civil War, as Kansas became known more for its cowboys, saloons and wide-open spaces, another notable song written in and about Kansas was &quot;Home on the Range&quot;. It was penned in the state in the 1870s, and then spread throughout the American Old West as an unofficial anthem. It is now Kansas&#x27;s official state song. The song established something of a template for Kansas music, and over the next several decades, music coming from Kansas remained in a similar folk or old-time music style, while lyrics referencing the state tended to focus on its open countryside.

Composer and musician Nathaniel Clark Smith, born at Fort Leavenworth, was an important music educator in the early 1900s. In the 1920s, the Kansas City jazz scene developed in eastern Kansas. Coleman Hawkins, who introduced the tenor saxophone to jazz, was raised in Topeka, and began touring in eastern Kansas by 1918 (at the age of 14). Singer Ada Brown was born in Kansas City. Drummer Kansas Fields was born in Chapman. Pianist, singer, and bandleader Joe Sanders was born in Thayer. Harpist Betty Glamann was born in Wellington. Singer and composer Nora Holt, a figure in the Harlem Renaissance, was born in Kansas City, Kansas. Choral conductor Eva Jessye, a contemporary of Holt, was born in Lawrence. In the following years, Kansas native Charlie Parker (d. 1955, buried near Kansas City, MO) also came to prominence in Kansas City. Around the same time, Kansan Stan Kenton likewise became notable as a jazz band leader and pianist. Pianist Jesse Stone was born in Atchison. Alto saxophonist Bobby Watson was born in Lawrence.

Outsider musician and composer Moondog was born in Marysville.

Joe Walsh of Eagles and James Gang fame is a native of Wichita, although he spent his youth in Columbus, Ohio. Melissa Etheridge and Katrina Leskanich (lead singer for Katrina and the Waves) are also native Kansans. Gene Clark, founding member of The Byrds, attended high school in Bonner Springs and began performing in the state. Dawayne Bailey, a native of Manhattan, Kansas, toured and recorded with Detroit rock legend Bob Seger. Stanley Sheldon, a bassist from Ottawa, played with UK rocker Peter Frampton at the height of his career in the mid-1970s, including the top selling &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot;. Sheldon contributed as both bassist and songwriter on Frampton&#x27;s instrumental album &quot;Fingerprints&quot;, which was a Grammy winner in 2007. Sheldon went on to perform with Mid-west rocker Warren Zevon and other famous rock musicians. Grammy and Dove Award winning guitarist Phil Keaggy was a resident of Leawood in the 1980s. Jennifer Knapp, born in Chanute, is a Grammy-nominated, Dove Award-winning Christian folk rock musician whose first album, released in 1998, was certified gold. Finally, Shooting Star, notable for being the first American act signed by Virgin Records, hailed from Overland Park.

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960s, R&amp;B, blue-eyed soul, and garage rock bands became popular with acts such as the Fabulous Flippers, The Blue Things, the Red Dogs, The Serfs, Eric &amp; The Norsemen, The Sensational Showmen of Concordia, Wade Flemons, and Mike Finnigan traveling the Midwest and releasing regional singles.

=== 1970s ===
Hard prog rock band Kansas gained hits such as &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;(1976) and &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;(1978).

=== 1980s ===
In the early 1980s, Wichita, Topeka, and Lawrence, together with Kansas City, Missouri had a significant hardcore punk scene, centered at Lawrence&#x27;s University of Kansas campus, and later at the Outhouse. Among the most popular bands were The Embarrassment, Get Smart!, and Mortal Micronotz.

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s, Kansas produced some bands that found regional and national success taking the predominant grunge aesthetic and adding a rockabilly or country music twang, a style sometimes grouped into Alternative country.

Paw, out of Lawrence became the most well-known of these bands following the 1993 release of their major-label album &quot;Dragline&quot;. Truck Stop Love, out of Manhattan, Kansas, had a somewhat similar sound and was also signed to a national label, Scotti Brothers Records, with the well-received &quot;How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot; being an appropriate swan song. The Moving Van Goghs, also from Manhattan, with a psychedelic/rock aesthetic, is also a notable band during the &quot;pre-grunge&quot; time period in the Kansas music scene. Finally, Kill Creek, a Lawrence band since the 1980s period was signed by Mammoth Recordings and achieved critical national attention with three full LPs and an EP. The sound of these bands was comparable to some Neil Young and their out-of-state contemporaries Dinosaur Jr. and Nirvana (USA). Other bands from Kansas signed during the same period included Shiner, Sin City Disciples, Season to Risk, Everywhere, and Arthur Dodge and the Horsefeathers.
Early contemporaries included The Pedaljets, a band fronted by Mike Allmayer who later formed Grither. The Pedaljets put out two LPs, &quot;Today Today&quot; (Twilight), &quot;The Pedaljets&quot; (Communion), and one 45 (Throbbing Lobster). Both albums received critical national attention. The Pedaljets toured the US extensively from 1984–1990, often opening for Hüsker Dü, The Flaming Lips, Soul Asylum, The Replacements, Meat Puppets, and other well known alternative bands of the 1980s. Late contemporaries included Grither, Zoom, Vitreous Humor, Believe it or Nots, and Stick. Notable musicians of this time to come from Kansas are Mark Hart, Danny Carey, Kliph Scurlock, and Brody Buster.

DVS Mindz was an underground hip hop group formed in Topeka in 1993.

===2000s===

Midwest hip hop artists XV from Wichita and Emcee N.I.C.E. from Topeka emerged in the early 2000s. Kansas bands that gained notoriety were Ultimate Fakebook, Pomeroy, Frogpond, Paw, Mates of State, and Appleseed Cast.

<text>Robert Elwood Bly (December 23, 1926 – November 21, 2021) was an American poet, essayist, activist and leader of the mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement. His best-known prose book is &quot;Iron John: A Book About Men&quot; (1990), which spent 62 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and is a key text of the mythopoetic men’s movement. He won the 1968 National Book Award for Poetry for his book &quot;The Light Around the Body&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Bly was born in Lac qui Parle County, Minnesota, the son of Alice Aws and Jacob Thomas Bly, who were of Norwegian ancestry. Following graduation from high school in 1944, he enlisted in the United States Navy, serving two years. After one year at St. Olaf College in Minnesota, he transferred to Harvard University, joining other young persons who became known as writers: Donald Hall, Will Morgan, Adrienne Rich, Kenneth Koch, Frank O&#x27;Hara, John Ashbery, Harold Brodkey, George Plimpton and John Hawkes. He graduated in 1950 and spent the next few years in New York.

Beginning in 1954, Bly studied for two years at the University of Iowa at the Iowa Writers Workshop, completing a master&#x27;s degree in fine arts, along with W. D. Snodgrass, Donald Justice, and others. In 1956, he received a Fulbright Grant to travel to Norway and translate Norwegian poetry into English. While there, he became acquainted with the work of a number of major international poets whose work was barely known in the United States. These included both Norwegians and writers from Spain, Latin America and elsewhere, among them Gunnar Ekelof, Harry Martinson, Georg Trakl, Antonio Machado, Pablo Neruda, Cesar Vallejo, Rumi, Hafez, Kabir, and Mirabai. He also connected with some of his family&#x27;s relations.

==Personal life==
Bly lived on a farm in Minnesota with his wife Carol (née McLean), whom he married in 1955, and their four children. Carol Bly was also a writer, winning awards for her short stories and novels. Robert and Carol divorced in 1979. Their daughter Mary Bly is a professor at Fordham University and author of romance novels under the pseudonym Eloisa James. In 1980, Robert Bly married Ruth Counsell and became the stepfather to her two children. In 2012, his daughter Mary told Minnesota Public Radio that he had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Bly died at his home in Minneapolis on November 21, 2021, at the age of 94.

==Career==
Bly&#x27;s early collection of poems, &quot;Silence in the Snowy Fields,&quot; was published in 1962. Its plain, imagistic style had considerable influence on American verse of the next two decades. The following year, he published &quot;A Wrong Turning in American Poetry&quot;, an essay in which he argued that the vast majority of American poetry from 1917 to 1963 was lacking in soul and &quot;inwardness&quot; as a result of a focus on impersonality and an objectifying, intellectual view of the world. Bly believed this approach was instigated by the Modernists and formed the aesthetic of most post-World War II American poetry. He criticized the influence of American-born Modernists such as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams, and argued that American poetry needed to model itself on the more inward-looking work of European and South American poets like Pablo Neruda, César Vallejo, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Antonio Machado, and Rainer Maria Rilke. A &quot;Selected Poems&quot; translation of Rilke from the German, with Commentary by Bly, was published in 1981. &quot;Times Alone, Selected Poems of Antonio Machado&quot;, with facing page Spanish/English translation, was published in 1983.

In 1966, Bly co-founded American Writers Against the Vietnam War and was among the leaders of the opposition to that war among writers. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war. In his speech accepting the 1968 National Book Award for &quot;The Light Around the Body&quot;, he announced that he would be contributing the $1000 prize to draft resistance organizations.

During the sixties Bly aided the Bengali Hungryalist poets who faced anti-establishment trials at Kolkata, India. Bly&#x27;s 1970 poem &quot;The Teeth Mother Naked at Last&quot;, later collected in his book &quot;Sleepers Joining Hands&quot; (1973), is a major contribution to anti-war poetry of the Vietnam War era. During the 1970s, he published eleven books of poetry, essays, and translations. He celebrated the power of myth, Indian ecstatic poetry, meditation, and storytelling. During the 1980s he published &quot;Loving a Woman in Two Worlds&quot;, &quot;The Wingéd Life: Selected Poems and Prose of Thoreau,&quot; &quot;The Man in the Black Coat Turns,&quot; and &quot;A Little Book on the Human Shadow&quot;.

Perhaps his most famous work is &quot;Iron John: A Book About Men&quot; (1990). This became an international bestseller and has been translated into many languages; it is credited with inspiring the Mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement in the United States.

Bly frequently conducted workshops for men, together with James Hillman, Michael J. Meade, and others, as well as workshops for men and women with Marion Woodman. He maintained a friendly correspondence with Clarissa Pinkola Estés, author of &quot;Women Who Run with the Wolves&quot;. Bly wrote &quot;The Maiden King: The Reunion of Masculine and Feminine&quot; with Marion Woodman. He published a poetry anthology titled &quot;The Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart&quot; (1992), with James Hillman and Michael Meade co-editing.

===Great Mother Conference===
In 1975, Bly organized a &quot;Great Mother Conference&quot;. Throughout the nine-day event, poetry, music, and dance were practiced to examine human consciousness. The conference has been held annually; since 2003 in Nobleboro, Maine. In the early years, one of its major themes was the goddess or &quot;Great Mother&quot;, as she has been known throughout human history. Much of Bly&#x27;s collection &quot;Sleepers Joining Hands&quot; (1973) is concerned with this theme. In the context of the Vietnam War, a focus on the divine feminine was seen as urgent and necessary. Since that time, the Conference has expanded its topics to consider a wide variety of poetic, mythological, and fairy tale traditions. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was much discussion among the conference community about the changes which contemporary men were going through, so &quot;The New Father&quot; was added to the Conference title. Bly stopped attending after 2010.

==Awards and legacy==
Bly was the University of Minnesota Library&#x27;s 2002 Distinguished Writer. He received the McKnight Foundation&#x27;s Distinguished Artist Award in 2000, and the Maurice English Poetry Award in 2002. He has published more than 40 collections of poetry, edited many others, and published translations of poetry and prose from such languages as Swedish, Norwegian, German, Spanish, Persian and Urdu. His book &quot;The Night Abraham Called to the Stars&quot; was nominated for a Minnesota Book Award. He also edited the prestigious &quot;Best American Poetry 1999&quot; (Scribners).

In 2006 the University of Minnesota purchased Bly&#x27;s archive, which contained more than 80,000 pages of handwritten manuscripts; a journal spanning nearly 50 years; notebooks of his &quot;morning poems&quot;; drafts of translations; hundreds of audio and videotapes, and correspondence with many writers such as James Wright, Donald Hall and James Dickey. The archive is housed at Elmer L. Andersen Library on the University of Minnesota campus. The university paid $775,000 from school funds and private donors.

In February 2008, Bly was named Minnesota&#x27;s first poet laureate. In that year he also contributed a poem and an Afterword to &quot;From the Other World: Poems in Memory of James Wright&quot;. In February 2013, he was awarded the Robert Frost Medal, a lifetime achievement recognition given by the Poetry Society of America.

==Translation==
Bly&#x27;s willingness to collaborate with others is especially evident in his extensive translation work. Working with people knowledgeable about the poet&#x27;s native language, Bly applies his craft as a poet to creating a non-literal, poetic translation. The poets that interest him most embody his idea of &quot;Leaping Poetry&quot;, explained in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Leaping Poetry: An Idea with Poems and Translations Chosen by Robert Bly&quot;. The poets he chooses in the book as examples of this leaping poetry included Federico García Lorca, Cesar Vallejo, Pablo Neruda, Rainer Maria Rilke and Tomas Tranströmer. He says:

&quot;News of the Universe: Poems of Twofold Consciousness&quot; is a collection of poetry from around the world in 1995. In the introductory note Bly explains the book was requested by Sierra Club Books, and was to be poems relating to ecology. He begins the book with seven poems he calls &quot;The Old Position&quot;, which are poems from the 18th century which &quot;dismissed nature as defective because it lacks reason&quot;. The next part is the &quot;Attack on the Old Position&quot;, followed by four more sections, and all non-English poets are translated by Bly. &quot;The Winged Energy of Delight, Selected Translations&quot; (2004) includes poets translated in &quot;Leaping Poetry,&quot; along with translations from Japanese, Spanish, Arabic and other world poets.

Bly&#x27;s interest in Eastern ecstatic poetry flowered with the publication in 1971 of &quot;The Kabir Book, Forty-four of the Ecstatic Poems of Kabir&quot;. It was a compilation of poems previously published in a variety of journals, reviews, and magazines. In 1981, Yellow Moon Press published &quot;Night and Sleep&quot;, which contained translations of Rumi by Coleman Barks and Robert Bly. Barks collaborated with John Moyne and his literal Persian translations. Bly worked with translations from the Persian original by A.J. Arberry and Reynold A. Nicholson. A book translating Mirabai followed in 2004, co-authored with Jane Hirshfield, with an afterword by John Stratton Hawley. In 2001, &quot;The Night Abraham Called to the Stars&quot; published Bly&#x27;s celebration of the &quot;ghazal&quot;, of which the cover flap says &quot;Bly offers Western readers the opportunity to experience the thrilling leaps that the ghazal allows.&quot; In 2008, &quot;The Angels Knocking on the Tavern Door&quot; gave us thirty poems by Hafez translated by Bly and noted Islamic scholar Leonard Lewisohn.

==Thought and the Men&#x27;s Movement==
Much of Bly&#x27;s prose writing focuses on what he saw as the particularly troubled situation in which many males find themselves today. He understood this to be a result of, among other things, the decline of traditional fathering which left young boys unguided through the stages of life leading to maturity. He claimed that in contrast with women who are better informed by their bodies (notably by the beginning and end of their menstrual cycle), men need to be actively guided out of boyhood and into manhood by their elders. Pre-modern cultures had elaborate myths, often enacted as rites of passage, as well as &quot;men&#x27;s societies&quot; where older men would teach young boys about these gender-specific issues. As modern fathers have become increasingly absent, this knowledge is no longer being passed down the generations, resulting in what he referred to as a Sibling Society. The &quot;Absence of the Father&quot; is a recurrent theme in Bly&#x27;s work and according to him, many of the phenomena of depression, juvenile delinquency and lack of leadership in business and politics are linked to it.

Bly therefore saw today&#x27;s men as half-adults, trapped between boyhood and maturity, in a state where they find it hard to become responsible in their work as well as leaders in their communities. Eventually they might become weak or absent fathers themselves which will cause this behaviour to be passed down to their children. In his book &quot;The Sibling Society&quot; (1997), Bly argues that a society formed of such men is inherently problematic as it lacks creativity and a deep sense of empathy. The image of half-adults is further reinforced by popular culture which often portrays fathers as naive, overweight and almost always emotionally co-dependent. Historically this represents a recent shift from a traditional patriarchal model and Bly believes that women rushed to fill the gap that was formed through the various youth movements during the 1960s, enhancing men&#x27;s emotional capacities and helping them to connect with women&#x27;s age-old pain of repression. It has, however, also led to the creation of &quot;soft males&quot; who lack the outwardly directed strength to revitalize the community with assertiveness and a certain warrior strength.

In Bly&#x27;s view, a potential solution lay in the rediscovery of the meanings hidden in traditional myths and fairytales as well as works of poetry. He researched and collected myths that concern male maturity, often originating from the &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; and published them in various books, &quot;Iron John&quot; being the best known example. In contrast to the continual pursuit of higher achievements that is constantly taught to young men today, the theme of spiritual descent (often being referred to by its Greek term &quot;κατάβασις&quot;), which is to be found in many of these myths, is presented as a necessary step for coming in contact with the deeper aspects of the masculine self and achieving its full potential. This is often presented as hero, often during the middle of his quest, going underground to pass a period of solitude and sorrow in semi-bestial mode. Bly noticed that a cultural space existed in most traditional societies for such a period in a man&#x27;s life, in the absence of which, many men today go into a depression and alcoholism as they subconsciously try to emulate this innate ritual.

Bly was influenced by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who developed the theory of archetypes, the discrete structures of the Psyche which emerge as images in dreams, myths, and art. The Powerful King, the Evil Witch and the Beautiful Maiden are, according to Jung, some of the imprints of the collective unconscious and Bly wrote extensively about their meaning and relations to modern life. As an example and in accordance with Jung, he considered the Witch to be that part of the male psyche upon which the negative and destructive side of a woman is imprinted and which first developed during infancy to store the imperfections of one&#x27;s own mother. As a consequence, the Witch&#x27;s symbols are essentially inverted motherly symbols, where the loving act of cooking is transformed into the brewing of evil potions and knitting clothes takes the form of spider&#x27;s web. The feeding process is also reversed, with the child now in danger of being eaten to feed the body of the Witch rather than being fed by the mother&#x27;s own body. In that respect, the Witch is a mark of arrested development on the part of the man as it guards against feminine realities that his psyche is not yet able to incorporate fully. Fairy tales according to this interpretation mostly describe internal battles played out externally, where the hero saves his future bride by killing a witch, as in &quot;The Drummer&quot; (Grimms tale 193). This particular concept is expanded in Bly&#x27;s 1989 talk &quot;The Human Shadow&quot; and the book it presented.

==Criticism==
In an early essay, New Formalist and New Narrative poet Dana Gioia examined the poetry career of Robert Bly, whom Gioia called &quot;one of the most famous and most influential poets writing in America.&quot; While Gioia praised some of Bly&#x27;s poetry attacking U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, he argued that Bly&#x27;s success had more to do with self promotion than with literary talent. Gioia further called Bly&#x27;s free verse translations of the work of formal poets &quot;insensitive to both the sound and nuance of the originals&quot;, and accused Bly, by encouraging &quot;this minimal kind of translation&quot;, of having &quot;done immense damage to American poetry.&quot; In conclusion, Gioia wrote, &quot;Bly insists on being judged as a major poet, but his verse cannot bear the weight of that demand.&quot;

<text>A guitar pick (American English) is a plectrum used for guitars. Picks are generally made of one uniform material, such as some kind of plastic (nylon, Delrin, celluloid), rubber, felt, tortoiseshell, wood, metal, glass, tagua, thermosetting plastic or stone. They are often shaped in an acute isosceles triangle with the two equal corners rounded and the third corner less rounded. They are used to strum chords or to sound individual notes on a guitar.

In British English, guitar picks are referred to as &quot;plectra&quot;, reserving the term &quot;pick&quot; to identify the difference between this and finger picks. 

== History ==

Musicians have used plectra to play stringed instruments for thousands of years. Feather quills were likely the first standardized plectra and became widely used until the late 19th century. At that point, the shift towards what became the superior plectrum material took place; the outer shell casing of an Atlantic hawksbill sea turtle, which would colloquially be referred to as tortoiseshell. Other alternatives had come and gone, but tortoiseshell provided the best combination of tonal sound and physical flexibility for plucking a taut string. Prior to the 1920s most guitar players used thumb and finger picks (used for the banjo or mandolin) when looking for something to play their guitar with, but with the rise of musician Nick Lucas, the use of a flat &quot;plectrum style guitar pick&quot; became popular.

There have been many innovations in the design of the guitar pick. Most of these were born out of the issue of guitar picks slipping and flying out of the hand of the player. In 1896, a Cincinnati man (Frederick Wahl) affixed two rubber disks to either side of a mandolin pick, which made it the first popular solution to the problem. Over the next two decades more innovations were made, such as corrugating the rounded surface of the pick or drilling a hole through the center to fit the pad of a player&#x27;s thumb. A more notable improvement was attaching cork to the wide part of the pick, a solution first patented by Richard Carpenter and Thomas Towner of Oakland in 1917. Some of these new designs made picks undesirably expensive. Eventually, pickers realized that all they needed was something to sink their fingerprints into so the pick wouldn&#x27;t slip, such as a high relief imprinted logo. Celluloid was a material on which this could easily be done.

Tony D&#x27;Andrea was one of the first people to use celluloid to produce and sell guitar picks. In 1902 he came upon a sidewalk sale offering some sheets of tortoise shell colored cellulose nitrate plastic and dies, and eventually he would discover that the small pieces of celluloid he punched out with the dies were ideal for picking stringed instruments. From the 1920s through the 1950s, D&#x27;Andrea Manufacturing would dominate the world&#x27;s international pick market, providing to major businesses such as Gibson, Fender, and Martin. One of the main reasons celluloid was so popular as guitar pick material was that it very closely imitated the sound and flexibility of a tortoise shell guitar pick. The practice of using Hawksbill turtles for their shells would become illegal in 1973 as a provision of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), forcing musicians to find something else to pick with.

Celluloid provided a good alternative in many ways. Tortoise shell was rare, expensive, and had a tendency to break. Celluloid was made from cellulose, one of the most abundant raw materials in the world, and nitrocellulose combined with camphor under heat and pressure produced celluloid. Though originally meant as a replacement for ivory billiard balls, celluloid began being used for many things for its flexibility, durability, and relative inexpensiveness, making it a natural candidate as a material for guitar picks. Later, other materials, such as nylon (and less commonly wood, glass, or metal) would become popular for making guitar picks for their increased grip, flexibility, or tonal qualities.

== Styles ==

D&#x27;Andrea Picks was the first company to create custom pick imprinting in 1938, allowing customers to order imprinting up to 12 block letters. One of the first to make the player imprint popular was guitarist Nick Lucas in the early 1930s.

== Sound ==
Playing guitar with a pick produces a bright sound compared to plucking with the fingertip. Picks also offer a greater contrast in tone across different plucking locations; for example, the difference in brightness between plucking close to the bridge and close to the neck is much greater when using a pick compared to a fingertip. Conversely, the many playing techniques that involve the fingers, such as those found in fingerstyle guitar, slapping, classical guitar, and flamenco guitar, can also yield an extremely broad variety of tones.

== Beveled edges ==
Most thicker guitar picks have so-called beveled edges.
While many guitarists use pick slanting for fast solo riffs, this won&#x27;t be needed when a pick has beveled edges.
With pick slanting, the pick is turned clock- or counter-clock wise to let the guitar pick glide off of the string easier when using standard thinner flat picks.
In fact, most beveled edges start at a pick thickness of 2.0mm and up.
Beveled edges make it easier to play without turning the guitar pick in a certain position.

== Materials ==
=== Plastics ===


Most common mass-manufactured picks are made out of various types of plastic. Most popular plastics include:
* Celluloid. Historically, this was the first plastic ever used to produce picks, and it is still widely used today, especially for guitarists aiming for vintage tone. Celluloid picks generally have a tortoiseshell design.
* Nylon. A popular material, it has a smooth and slick surface, so most manufacturers add a high-friction coating to nylon picks to make them easier to grip. Nylon is flexible and can be produced in very thin sheets. Most thin and extra-thin picks are made out of nylon. However, nylon loses its flexibility after 1–2 months of extensive use and eventually becomes fragile and breaks. Introduced in 1961 Herco developed the first nylon guitar pick. It became the pick of choice for many professional guitarists of the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s. Due to the unique composition of nylon it was described as a &quot;radical new idea in guitar picks&quot; by &quot;Fretts&quot; magazine. Notable users of this pick have included Ace Frehley, Joe Walsh, John Entwistle who used the Herco for the bass guitar, Jimmy Page preferred the Heavy Flex 75 variant, David Gilmour, and Tommy Bolin who favored the Herco Gold pick which he would customize by chewing on them which he said, &quot;loosens them up and gives them a feeling somewhere between a heavy and medium thickness&quot;.
* Acetal. Acetal is a highly durable class of plastics. Delrin is DuPont&#x27;s trademarked name for a type of acetal. Delrin is hard, glossy and durable, and can also be doped to produce a matte texture. The friction between a steel or nickel guitar string, and smooth, glossy acetal is very low. Glossy delrin picks literally glide across the string and therefore have a fast release, producing very little pick noise, while delivering a rounded tone emphasizing the lower order harmonics. Matte finish acetal picks like the Clayton Acetal generate a bit more pick noise, and a more aggressive attack, but the additional friction of the matte surface helps the guitarist hold the pick more securely. Delrex is a variation of Tortex, which is by itself Delrin. It was invented to replace tortoiseshell since the trade of tortoiseshell was banned in 1973. Delrex is used as the material for Dunlop&#x27;s &quot;Gator&quot; picks.
* Ultem. This plastic has one of the highest stiffness of all plastic picks. It produces a bright tone and is popular among mandolin players.
* Lexan. Glossy, glass-like, very hard, but lacking durability. Used for thick and extra-thick picks (&gt; 1 mm). Usually has a high-friction grip coating.
* Acrylic. Tough, light, clear, seamless polymer with great resistance to impact and weathering. Acrylic is not brittle and does not yellow or crack. Can be molded and cut to almost any shape and thickness. It renders a very full spectrum tonal range when used as a plectrum on stringed instruments. Some grades of acrylic have a unique gripping characteristic, and when warmed to the touch, become tacky or sticky feeling, causing the material to cling to your fingers. Acrylic can be heat tempered for strength and longevity. V-Picks are the first noted company to make acrylic guitar picks, dating as early as 1980, and are the only guitar pick manufacturer that heat tempers acrylic picks.
* Polyamide-imide is a material often used in aerospace applications as replacement for metallic alloys. Picks made of this material have low friction on the strings and high durability.
* Kirinite is very similar in sound to Acrylic, but more durable. Many pick makers prefer it over Acrylic because of its resistance to friction and impact.
* Galalith picks excel at emulating the tone received from tortoiseshell, because they are both made of high percentage of keratine
* UHMW-PE (also often referred to as UHMW, or UHMWPE) is a shorter name for Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene. This type of thermosetting plastic is characterized in warm tone and extreme durability.
* Polystyrene. Custom guitar picks may be made using sheets of shrink plastic (such as, Shrinky Dinks)

=== Metal ===

Picks made from various metals produce a harmonically richer sound than plastic, and change the sound of the acoustic and electric guitar. Some metal picks are even made from coins, which give players a unique tone as the alloys used in various coinage from around the world vary greatly.
Playing guitar with a silver pick gives a unique, rich and bright sound, very different from normal plectrums (Brian May of Queen often plays with a silver sixpence).

=== Horn, bone, leather (animal products) ===

Plectrums crafted from natural animal byproduct are the oldest materials known due to their availability and durability, and are still regularly used by plectriers to craft guitar, bass and mandolin picks. The tonality produced by each type of natural animal material varies greatly, and is further enhanced by the thickness and shaping of each material.

=== Wood ===
Each guitar pick made of wood has its own unique properties and signature sound as a result of differences in density, hardness and cellular structure. Most wood picks produce a warmer tone than plastics or metals. To withstand the rigors of picking and strumming only the hardest woods on the Janka scale are used for picks—including hardwoods like African Blackwood, Bocote, Cocobolo, Lignum vitae, Rosewood, and Zebrawood. While the thick and sometimes rough edge of a wooden pick may create a fair amount of drag at first, wooden picks are generally easy to break in and may even do so quicker than plastic picks. After a couple of hundred strokes, the metal guitar strings wear down the edge and create a smoother pass over the strings.

=== Glass ===
Glass is relatively hard and heavy in comparison to metal or plastic and therefore produces a greater range of tone than these materials. Glass can be polished to a smooth or rough texture depending on the grit of sandpaper used. Likewise, factors such as size, shape, and weight have a much more dramatic effect on the overall tone making each individual glass pick sound and feel unique. Due to the specialized tools needed to process glass, there are very few plectriers using this material. Contrary to popular belief, due to their small size and high gauge, glass guitar picks tend to be very durable and more resistant to impact (such as falling) than most stone picks.

=== Other ===
* Agate picks range in thickness from 1mm (very rare) up to 5mm, and are extremely inflexible. As they are harder than the metal guitar strings, they resonate the strings more completely.
* Felt picks are mainly used with the ukulele.
* New Tortis is an alternative to natural tortoise, made of polymerized animal protein. It is hard, smooth, thick, and has only slight tip flexibility.
* Tagua is a nut from South America grown on a Tagua Palm Tree. The material has similar properties to animal ivory so it&#x27;s also known as Vegetable Ivory. Tagua produces a very smooth clear tone as the material slides off the strings easily. Tagua guitar picks are generally hand made.
* Carbon Fiber is also used by PickHeaven, Dunlop, Timber Tone Picks and RJL guitars to make guitar picks. These picks are extremely durable and have an extremely high stiffness-to-weight ratio. The world&#x27;s thinnest guitar pick is made from carbon fiber and has a thickness of 0.2 mm.

== Shapes ==
Some picks have small protrusions to make them easier to keep hold if the fingers start to sweat, which is very common on stage due to the hot lights. Some picks have a high-friction coating to help the player hold on to them. The small perforations in the stainless steel pick serve the same function. Players often have spare picks attached to a microphone stand or slotted in the guitar&#x27;s pickguard.

The equilateral pick can be easier for beginners to hold and use since each corner may be used as a playing edge.

The shark&#x27;s fin pick can be used in two ways: normally, employing the blunt end; or the small perturbations can be raked across the strings producing a much fuller chord, or used to apply a &quot;pick scrape&quot; down the strings producing a very harsh, scratching noise.

The sharp edged pick is used to create an easier motion of picking across the strings.

Some guitar pick shapes are patented. Usually those patents claim ornamental design.

== Technique ==

Picks are usually gripped with two fingers—thumb and index—and are played with pointed end facing the strings. However, it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference and many notable musicians use different grips. For example, Eddie Van Halen held the pick between his thumb and middle finger (leaving his first finger free for his tapping technique); James Hetfield, Jeff Hanneman and Steve Morse hold a pick using 3 fingers—thumb, middle and index; Pat Metheny and The Edge also hold their picks with three fingers but play using the rounded side of the plectrum rather than the pointed end. George Lynch also uses the rounded side of the pick. Stevie Ray Vaughan also played with the rounded edge of the pick, citing the fact that the edge allowed more string attack than the tip. His manic, aggressive picking style would wear through pickguards in short order, and wore a groove in his Fender Stratocaster, Number One, over his years of playing. Noted &#x27;80s session guitarist David Persons is known for using old credit cards, cut to the correct size and thickness and using them without a tip.

The motion of the pick against the string is also a personal choice. George Benson and Dave Mustaine, for example, hold the pick very stiffly between the thumb and index finger, locking the thumb joint and striking with the surface of the pick nearly parallel to the string, for a very positive, articulate, consistent tone. Other guitarists have developed a technique known as &quot;circle picking&quot;, where the thumb joint is bent on the downstroke and straightened on the upstroke, causing the tip of the pick to move in a circular pattern, which can allow speed and fluidity. Many rock guitarists use a flourish (called a pick slide or pick scrape) that involves scraping the pick along the length of a round wound string (a round wound string is a string with a coil of round wire wrapped around the outside, used for the heaviest three or four strings on a guitar). The first use of the pick slide is attributed to Bo Diddley and can be heard in the opening of his song &quot;Road Runner&quot;.

The two chief approaches to fast picking are alternate picking and economy picking. Alternate picking is when the player strictly alternates each stroke between downstrokes and upstrokes, regardless of changing strings. In economy picking, the player uses the most economical stroke on each note. For example, if the first note is on the fifth string, and the next note is on the fourth string, the guitarist uses a downstroke on the fifth string, and continue in the same direction to execute a downstroke on the fourth string. Some guitarists learn economy picking intuitively and find it an effort to use alternate picking. Conversely, some guitarists maintain that the down-up &quot;twitch&quot; motion of alternate picking lends itself to momentum, and hence trumps economy picking at high speeds.

<text>Sheri Stewart Tepper (July 16, 1929 – October 22, 2016) was an American writer of science fiction, horror and mystery novels. She is primarily known for her feminist science fiction, which explored themes of sociology, gender and equality, as well as theology and ecology. Often referred to as an eco-feminist of science fiction literature, Tepper personally preferred the label eco-humanist. Some of her novels fall into the category of climate fiction, in which the changing environment of a planet affects the life of its colonists (or vice versa) in the form of a mystery to be solved; examples include &quot;Grass&quot; (1989), &quot;Beauty&quot; (1991), &quot;A Plague of Angels&quot; (1993), &quot;The Family Tree&quot; (1997), &quot;Six Moon Dance&quot; (1998), and &quot;Singer from the Sea&quot; (1999). Though the majority of her works operate in a world of fantastical imagery and metaphor, at the heart of her writing is real-world injustice and pain. She employed several pen names during her lifetime, including A. J. Orde, E. E. Horlak, and B. J. Oliphant. 

==Early life and education==

She was born Shirley Stewart Douglas near Littleton, Colorado. As a child, she read science fiction and fantasy by A. Merritt and C.S. Lewis, as well as Frank Baum&#x27;s &#x27;Oz&#x27; books, William Hope Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;The Night Land&quot; and &quot;Islandia&quot; by Austin Tappan Wright. She later commented, &quot;These were the books I went back to again and again.&quot;

==Career==

Tepper recalled that she &quot;spent ten years...working all kinds of different jobs&quot; as a single mother of two. This included time working as a clerical assistant for the international relief agency, CARE. From 1962 to 1986, she worked for Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood, eventually as its executive director.

She wrote poetry and children&#x27;s stories as Sheri S. Eberhart, then took a break from writing. By the mid-1980s, she was publishing science fiction novels, including &quot;The Revenants&quot; (1984), and the books of the &quot;True Game&quot; series, including &quot;King&#x27;s Blood Four&quot; (1983), &quot;Necromancer Nine&quot; (1983), and &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (1984). Other related works followed, including her ecofeminist novels &quot;The Gate to Women&#x27;s Country&quot; (1988) and &quot;Grass&quot; (1989), which were part of the Arbai Trilogy. Later novels in the 1990s and 2000s included &quot;Beauty&quot; (1991), which won a Locus Award; &quot;Shadow&#x27;s End&quot; (1994); &quot;The Family Tree&quot; (1997); &quot;Six Moon Dance&quot; (1998); &quot;Singer from the Sea&quot; (1999); &quot;The Visitor&quot; (2002); &quot;The Companions&quot; (2003); and &quot;The Margarets&quot; (2007).

As of 1998, she operated a guest ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico. That year saw her first and possibly only appearance at a science fiction convention, when she was at the 25th WisCon, the feminist science fiction convention held annually in Madison, Wisconsin.

In November 2015, she received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement.

==Personal life==
She married at 20, and divorced in her late twenties. She married Gene Tepper in the late 1960s.

She died on October 22, 2016 at age 87.

<text>The Music of Nebraska has included a variety of country, jazz, blues, ragtime, rock, and alternative rock musicians. Though many cities and towns across the state have active musical scenes, artists from Omaha and Lincoln have a particularly important musical legacy.

==Omaha==

Artists on the label Saddle Creek Records in Omaha, such as Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Cursive, are nationally renowned. The formation of the sound occurred in the mid-1990s with Commander Venus, Frontier Trust, Weak, and Matchbook Shannon, and clubs such as the Cog Factory, and Sokol Music Hall. The 2000s saw a rise in popularity of Saddle Creek Records. The label went on to build a music venue called Slowdown. The Waiting Room also opened in March 2007.

The alternative music scene has produced such popular artists as 311, Beaver &amp; the Hottage Cutch, Betsy Wells and Grasshopper Takeover, and Omaha has been a temporary home base of Midwest bands such as Tilly and the Wall, Rilo Kiley, The Urge, Pomeroy, and Blue October. Tim McMahan&#x27;s Lazy-i and SLAMOmaha.com are the main media outlets promoting Saddle Creek and other Omaha bands.

In Omaha, a mainstay of the music scene is Nils Anders Erickson. The studio houses modern equipment and has recorded with artists with local connections such as 311, but what makes the studio famous is its collection of vintage equipment. On addition to the studio, Nils heads local jam band Paddy O&#x27;Furniture. Other mainstays of the music scene in Omaha include folk artists such as Simon Joyner, Kyle Knapp, and his son, Saddle Creek artist Joe Knapp, Joe Watson, Mike Murphy, Kevin Quinn, and electronic artists Peter None and Chip Davis.

Notable jazz musicians include jazz guitarist Dave Stryker and drummer Victor Lewis.

Omaha also has many heavier rock and metal acts. In the mid to late 1990s the bands Secret Skin, Clever, and Twitch dominated the scene with their highly rhythmic and guitar-driven sound. Since the turn of the millennium, it has been a strong spot for Metalcore bands. A good amount have gone on to be National acts, such as Analog, Paria, System Failure, and I Am Legend. Also, the Power Metal band Cellador hails from Omaha. It also draws many other heavy musical acts, including many Screamo artists, including Eyes of Verotika, Caught in the Fall, and Robots Don&#x27;t Cry. Other notable groups include Noah&#x27;s Ark was a Spaceship, Back When, and Father.

Blues advocates including Terry O&#x27;Halloran and the Omaha Blues Society have brought world class blues to Omaha. Local artists like Satchel Grande, Kris Lager Band, and Funk Trek are examples of popular local blues artists. Their predecessors Electric Soul Method and Polydypsia helped set the stage for this music to grow in Omaha.

===North Omaha===
From the 1920s through the early 1960s North Omaha boasted a vibrant entertainment district featuring African American music. The main artery of North 24th Street was the heart of the city&#x27;s African-American cultural and business community with a thriving jazz and rhythm and blues scene that attracted top-flight swing, blues and jazz bands from across the country.

An important venue was the storied Dreamland Ballroom, which was opened in the Jewell Building in 1923 at 24th and Grant Streets in the Near North Side neighborhood. Dreamland hosted some of the greatest jazz, blues, and swing performers, including Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and the original Nat King Cole Trio. Whitney Young spoke there as well. Other venues included Jim Bell&#x27;s Harlem, opened in 1935 on Lake Street, west of 24th; McGill&#x27;s Blue Room, located at 24th and Lake, and Allen&#x27;s Showcase Lounge, which was located at 24th and Lake. Due to racial segregation, musicians such as Cab Calloway stayed at Myrtle Washington&#x27;s at 22nd and Willis while others stayed at Charlie Trimble&#x27;s at 22nd and Seward. The intersection of 24th and Lake was the setting of the Big Joe Williams song &quot;Omaha Blues&quot;.

===Notable North Omaha musicians===
Blues singer Wynonie Harris was born and raised in Omaha. Early North Omaha bands included Lewis&#x27; Excelsior Brass Band, Dan Desdunes Band, Simon Harrold&#x27;s Melody Boys, the Sam Turner Orchestra, the Ted Adams Orchestra, the Omaha Night Owls, Red Perkins and His Original Dixie Ramblers, and the Lloyd Hunter Band who became the first Omaha band to record in 1931. A Lloyd Hunter concert poster can be seen on display at the Community Center in nearby Mineola, Iowa.

North Omaha&#x27;s musical culture also birthed several nationally and internationally reputable African American musicians. Preston Love and drummer Buddy Miles were friends while growing up. They collaborated throughout their lives, and while they were playing with the greatest names in rock and roll, jazz, R&amp;B, and funk. Big Joe Williams and funk band leader Lester Abrams are also from North Omaha. Omaha-born Wynonie Harris, one of the founders of rock and roll, got his start at the North Omaha clubs and for a time lived in the now-demolished Logan Fontennelle projects at 2213 Charles Street.

===Surf===
One of Omaha&#x27;s most famous exports is the influential surf band The Chevrons, who were voted Omaha&#x27;s most popular band in 1966. Other 1960s bands include The Echos, 7 Legends, Velvet Haze, Little Denny Wonder, Freedom Road and The Beautiful People.

==Other places==
===Fremont===
The earliest rock and roll band from Fremont, Nebraska was The Nomads, followed by The Sneakers, The Fugitives, The Invaders, The Brakmen and The Coachmen. The long-running popular Haywood-Wakefield Band is maybe the region&#x27;s most influential. Doug Campbell from Lincoln, Little Joe &amp; the Ramrods, The Smoke Ring, Don Sohl &amp; the Roadrunners and Ron Thompson &amp; the Broughams were also influential.

===Lincoln===
Lincoln has had a thriving music scene since the 1950s. Lincoln&#x27;s Zager and Evans hit #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for six weeks with their song &quot;In the Year 2525&quot; from 1969. Zager and Evans met at Nebraska Wesleyan University. Starting in the late 1970s, with the coming of the punk movement there has been and remains an explosion in rock bands on the Lincoln scene. In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, many notable bands like 13 Nightmares, Leafy Green Things, The Gladstones, The New Brass Guns, For Against, The Millions, Charlie Burton, Sideshow, 2 Below, Matthew Sweet and Mercy Rule came from Lincoln. Current notable artists The Brigandines, The JV All*Stars, An Hobbes Stonebelly, BlackDoubt, Ideal Cleaners, Straight Outta Junior High, Nick Hardt, Brimstone Howl, The Awkwords, Josh Hoyer &amp; Soul Colossal, and Eagle*Seagull. Indie record labels that originated in Lincoln include Wild Records, Caulfield Records and -ismist Recordings. The brothers A.J. Mogis and Mike Mogis also own Presto! Recording Studios which is located in Lincoln.

The Zoo Bar in Lincoln, styled around the Chicago blues clubs, brought in many popular artists from Chicago in the 1970s such as Magic Slim, Bo Diddley and Robert Cray. The venue celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2023.

<text>Gen. José Braulio Cástulo Alemán Urquía (23 March 1866 – 15 January 1930), was a Cuban brigadier general in the Spanish–American War, promoted to major general after the war. He also worked as a politician, lawyer and journalist, and was the Governor of the province of Santa Clara (or Las Villas) and the Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts of Cuba.

General Alemán was the principal author of the Constitution of Cuba proclaimed at La Yaya in 1897. This Constitution was used as template for the 1901 Constitution of the new Republic of Cuba.

==Biography==
He studied law, but he did not graduate. He was an owner and journalist of two newspapers at Santa Clara, Cuba in the province of Las Villas, he was incarcerated several times for articles written in favor of Cuba&#x27;s independence. He was a very prominent and key player in the fight against the Spanish and the eventual liberation of Cuba. Joining the fight for liberation from Spain he was soon promoted from colonel to brigader general. It was Alemán who served as prosecutor in the famous Morote trial for espionage and treason against the burgeoning republic. Alemán is fondly and respectfully remembered as the principal author of the Cuban Constitution written at La Yaya while still at arms against the Spanish in 1897. At the end of the war during the American occupation he was one of the very few dignitaries who voted against the unfair and terribly lopsided Platt Amendment.

Promoted to Major General after the war, Alemán served first as Governor and later as Senator for the province of Las Villas. He later became the Minister of Education for the newly established Republic of Cuba. He perhaps was the best Minister of Education Cuba ever produced. As Minister of Education he founded the first Agricultural Schools, the first Institutes of Commerce, the first Sports &amp; Physical Education Institute, and the School of Fine Arts at Santiago de Cuba. He also created the first night schools for adults, the first schools for Languages, and the Technical School of Rancho Boyeros in La Habana, Cuba. He was also instrumental in the partial reorganization of the University of Havana.

Still later in his political career he was appointed as Ambassador to Mexico where he was recognized for his beliefs in helping the native Indian poor and downtrodden. Alemán was a stalwart fighter for equal civil rights for all Cubans and for the right of suffrage. A brilliant statesman he was much admired, widely respected and loved by his contemporaries and the people of Cuba.

At his passing in 1930 all flags in the nation were flown at half mast and the President of Cuba, all his Cabinet Ministers, several foreign dignitaries and more than 100,000 citizens attended his funeral procession.

<doc id="307715" wikidata="Q30587" url="?curid=307715" title="Stan Getz">
<text>Stan Getz (born Stanley Gayetski; February 2, 1927 – June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as &quot;The Sound&quot; because of his warm, lyrical tone, with his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman&#x27;s big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as &quot;one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists&quot;. Getz performed in bebop and cool jazz groups. Influenced by João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim, he also helped popularize bossa nova in the United States with the hit 1964 single &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;.

==Early life==
Stan Getz was born Stanley Gayetski on February 2, 1927, at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Getz&#x27;s father Alexander (&quot;Al&quot;) was born in Mile End, London, in 1904, while his mother Goldie (née Yampolsky) was born in Philadelphia in 1907. His paternal grandparents Harris and Beckie Gayetski were originally from Kyiv, Ukraine, but had emigrated to escape the anti-Jewish pogroms to Whitechapel, in the East End of London. While in England they owned the Harris Tailor Shop at 52 Oxford Street for more than 13 years. In 1913, Harris and Beckie emigrated to the United States with their three sons Al, Phil, and Ben, following their son Louis Gayetski who had emigrated to the US the year before. Getz&#x27;s original family name, &quot;Gayetski&quot;, was changed to Getz upon arrival in America.

The Getz family first settled in Philadelphia, but during the Great Depression the family moved to New York City, seeking better employment opportunities. Getz worked hard in school, receiving straight A&#x27;s, and finished sixth grade close to the top of his class. Getz&#x27;s major interest was in musical instruments and he played a number of them including the harmonica that he acquired at the age of twelve, before his father bought him his first saxophone, a $35 alto saxophone, when he was thirteen. He moved on quickly to play all other saxophones, as well as the clarinet, but fell in love with the sound of the tenor saxophone, and began practicing eight hours a day while studying with Bill Shiner, a well-known saxophone teacher in the Bronx. According to Getz, he only had about six months of lessons and never studied music theory or harmony.

Getz attended James Monroe High School in the Bronx. In 1941, he was accepted into the All-City High School Orchestra of New York City. This gave him a chance to receive private, free tutoring from the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s Simon Kovar, a bassoon player. He also continued playing the saxophone at dances and bar mitzvahs. He eventually dropped out of school in order to pursue his musical career but was later sent back to the classroom by the school system&#x27;s truancy officers.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
In 1943, at the age of 16, he joined Jack Teagarden&#x27;s band and, because of his youth, he became Teagarden&#x27;s ward. Getz also played along with Nat King Cole and Lionel Hampton. A period based in Los Angeles with Stan Kenton was brief. Following a comment from Kenton that his main influence, Lester Young, was too simple, Getz quit.

After performing with Jimmy Dorsey, and Benny Goodman, Getz was a soloist with Woody Herman from 1947 to 1949 in The Second Herd, and he first gained wide attention as one of the band&#x27;s saxophonists, who were known collectively as &quot;The Four Brothers&quot;; the others being Serge Chaloff, Zoot Sims and Herbie Steward. With Herman, he had a hit with &quot;Early Autumn&quot; in 1948.

After Getz left The Second Herd, he was able to launch his solo career. in 1950, he was a guest soloist with Horace Silver&#x27;s trio at the Club Sundown in Hartford, Connecticut. He subsequently hired them for touring gigs, gaining Silver his earliest national exposure. For an unknown period, he didn&#x27;t pay Silver, using the money due the pianist to buy heroin. Silver finally left in June 1952. In the same period, Getz performed with pianists Al Haig and Duke Jordan and drummers Roy Haynes and Max Roach, as well as bassist Tommy Potter, all of whom had worked with Charlie Parker. Guitarists Jimmy Raney and Johnny Smith were also associated with the saxophonist in this period. He enhanced his profile with his featured performance on Johnny Smith&#x27;s version of the song &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot;, recorded in 1952, which became a hit single and stayed on the charts for months. A &quot;DownBeat&quot; readers&#x27; poll voted the single as the second best jazz record of 1952. The later album &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot;, reconfigured from two 10-inch LPs (RLP-410 and RLP-413) for a 12-inch release (LP-2211), was issued in 1956. By 1956, Ben Selvin, bandleader and record producer known as the Dean of Recorded Music, featured Getz&#x27;s recordings on national radio networks as part of the RCA Thesaurus transcriptions library.

A 1953 line-up of the Dizzy Gillespie/Stan Getz Sextet featured Gillespie, Getz, Oscar Peterson, Herb Ellis, Ray Brown and Max Roach. He moved to Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1958. Here he performed with pianist Jan Johansson and bassist Oscar Pettiford, among others, at the Club Montmartre.
===Return to United States===
Returning to the U.S. from Europe in 1961, Getz recorded the album &quot;Focus&quot; with arrangements by Eddie Sauter, who created a strings backing for the saxophonist. In a March 2021 article for the All About Jazz website, Chris May wrote of it as &quot;one of the great masterpieces of mid-twentieth century jazz&quot; and compared it to the work of Béla Bartók.

Getz became involved in introducing bossa nova music to the American audience teaming with guitarist Charlie Byrd, who had just returned from a U.S. State Department tour of Brazil. In 1962, they recorded the album &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; featuring their cover of Antonio Carlos Jobim&#x27;s &quot;Desafinado&quot; which became a hit and won Getz the Grammy for Best Jazz Performance of 1963. It sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a gold record. His second bossa nova album, also recorded in 1962, was &quot;Big Band Bossa Nova&quot; with composer and arranger Gary McFarland. As a follow-up to &quot;Jazz Samba&quot;, Getz recorded the album &quot;Jazz Samba Encore!&quot;, with one of the originators of bossa nova, Brazilian guitarist Luiz Bonfá. It also sold more than a million copies by 1964, giving Getz his second gold disc.

He then recorded the album &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, in 1963, with João Gilberto, his wife, Astrud and Antônio Carlos Jobim. A single from the album, &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; became a hit (1964) and won a Grammy Award. &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; won two Grammys (Best Album and Best Single). Getz and producer Creed Taylor claimed that the music&#x27;s success was a result of their discovery of the talent of Astrud Gilberto, who had never recorded as a vocalist. She and Gilberto and later their son, Marcelo, disputed Getz and Taylor&#x27;s version of the story, and alleged that Getz contrived it to deprive her of the royalties she was due.

A live album, &quot;Getz/Gilberto Vol. 2&quot;, followed, as did &quot;Getz Au Go Go&quot; (1964), a live recording at the Cafe au Go Go in New York City. While working with the Gilbertos, he recorded the jazz album &quot;Nobody Else But Me&quot; (1964), with a new quartet including vibraphonist Gary Burton, but Verve Records, wishing to continue building the Getz brand with bossa nova, refused to release it until 30 years later, after Getz had died.

===Later career===
In 1972, Getz recorded the jazz fusion album &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; with Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke and Tony Williams, and in this period experimented with an Echoplex on his saxophone. He had a cameo in the film &quot;The Exterminator&quot; (1980).

In the mid-1980s, Getz worked regularly in the San Francisco Bay area and taught at Stanford University as an artist-in-residence at the Stanford Jazz Workshop until 1988. In 1986, he was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame. During 1988, Getz worked with Huey Lewis and the News on their &quot;Small World&quot; album. He played the extended solo on part 2 of the title track, which became a minor hit single.

His tenor saxophone of choice was the Selmer Mark VI.

==Personal life==

Getz married Beverly Byrne, a vocalist with the Gene Krupa band, on November 7, 1946, in Los Angeles; the couple had three children.

In 1954, Getz held up a Seattle drugstore to obtain narcotics for his heroin addiction. After his arrest he attempted to suicide by overdose. He suffered from drug and alcohol dependency on and off for decades. In 1983, he began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly.

Getz divorced Byrne in Mexico in 1956, after which, due to Byrne&#x27;s own addictions, she was unable to take care of the children. Eventually, the children were awarded by the Court to Getz&#x27;s second wife, Monica Silfverskiöld, daughter of Swedish physician and former Olympic medalist Nils Silfverskiöld and Swedish Countess Mary von Rosen. Monica had insisted on raising the family together, as children had been divided among family members, and eventually they raised five children: Steven, David, and Beverley (children of Stan and Beverly); and Pamela and Nicolaus (children of Stan and Monica). The couple lived in Copenhagen, Denmark, partly to escape the prevalence of drugs in America at the time. Monica would also become Stan&#x27;s manager and a major influence in his life.

In 1962, Monica returned with the family to Sweden after having discovered Stan&#x27;s recurring addictions. During the following period, as he was trying to persuade her to come back, he sent her two test pressings, one of which, &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; with Charlie Byrd, was pivotal to her plans for the next record, &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;. However, Getz&#x27;s association with Byrd soured, due to a lawsuit that Byrd initiated against the record company. 

After Getz promised to stay clean and sober, Monica returned from Sweden with the family. On November 21, 1962, Brazil sent scores of musicians to Carnegie Hall as a result of the bossa nova craze created by &quot;Jazz Samba&quot;. After being told by Gilberto and Jobim that Getz had been an invisible partner in their creating of the Bossa Nova by superimposing Getz&#x27;s jazz harmonies and sound on the old samba, Monica suggested a unification of the three. Jobim and Gilberto reacted with deference and enthusiasm. Getz was reluctant, at first, as he had heard the two were &quot;difficult&quot;. Getz had reportedly said that he was convinced, when Monica retorted: &quot;Well, don&#x27;t &quot;you&quot; have a reputation for being difficult?&quot; They would become very close friends during the recording of &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, and Gilberto would even move in with the Getzes, occasionally joined by the children of his own two marriages and his second wife, Miúcha.

In the early 1980s, Getz again relapsed into his addictions, resulting in an arrest with an illegal gun in the home with Monica and some of the children. This resulted in an Order of Protection, issued in her favor, which contained a clause that Getz must be sober to be allowed into the house and an Order to go to treatment. As a countermove, Getz filed for divorce from Monica in 1981, but the couple reconciled at his insistence in 1982 and signed a Reconciliation Agreement in which they agreed to jointly buy a house they had found in San Francisco. Soon after, however, Getz relapsed. After a second illegal gun and cocaine incident, Monica returned to their New York home. At this time, she discovered the need for the courts to learn about addiction and founded the National Coalition for Family Justice in 1988, around the time a divorce was finalized. In 1990, Monica Getz petitioned the United States Supreme Court to have their divorce verdict overturned, which it declined. In 1987, he was diagnosed with cancer. 

Zoot Sims, who had known Getz since their time with Herman, once described him as &quot;a nice bunch of guys&quot;, an allusion to his unpredictable personality. Bob Brookmeyer, another performing colleague, responded to speculation Getz had a heart operation with the rhetorical question &quot;Did they put one in?&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Getz died of liver cancer on June 6, 1991. His ashes were poured from his saxophone case six miles off the coast of Marina del Rey, California.

<doc id="307721" wikidata="Q6942291" url="?curid=307721" title="Music of Texas">
<text>The U.S. state of Texas has long been a center for musical innovation and is the birthplace of many notable musicians. Texans have pioneered developments in Tejano and Conjunto music, Rock &#x27;n Roll, Western swing, jazz, Piano, punk rock, country, hip-hop, electronic music, gothic industrial music, religious music, mariachi, psychedelic rock, zydeco and the blues.

== Piano ==

Van Cliburn who was raised in Kilgore, Texas was an American pianist celebrated for his extraordinary talent and numerous accomplishments. He gained international fame after winning the first International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, Soviet Union in 1958, becoming an emblem of Cold War cultural diplomacy and a symbol of American musical excellence. Cliburn&#x27;s subsequent concert tours and recordings solidified his status, making him one of the first classical musicians to achieve pop star-like fame. He received numerous accolades throughout his career, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Cliburn also founded the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, which continues to celebrate and promote young pianists worldwide, further cementing his legacy in the classical music community, and the musical legacy of Kilgore.

==Religious music==
Sacred music has a long tradition in the state of Texas. The East Texas Musical Convention was organized in 1855, and is the oldest Sacred Harp convention in Texas, and the second oldest in the United States. The Southwest Texas Sacred Harp Convention was organized in 1900.

Sacred Harp and other books in four shape notation were the forerunners of seven shape note gospel music. According to the &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot;, &quot;The first Texas community singing using the seven shape note tradition reportedly occurred in the latter part of December 1879. Itinerant teachers representing the A. J. Showalter Company of Dalton, Georgia – including company founder A. J. Showalter – ventured west to Giddings in East Texas and conducted a rural music school that lasted for several weeks.&quot; Texas has been home to several gospel music convention publishers, including the National Music Company, Stamps-Baxter Music and Printing Company (founded in 1924 by V. O. Stamps, who later partnered with J. R. Baxter), and the Stamps Quartet Music Company (founded by Frank Stamps). Convention gospel music and community singings still occur in a number of Texas towns, including Mineral Wells, Brownfield, Jacksonville, Seymour, and Stephenville.

Gospel singer, songwriter, and musician Washington Phillips was from Freestone County. Gospel singer and pianist Arizona Dranes, who introduced ragtime and barrelhouse to gospel music, was from Texas as well.

==Ragtime and vaudeville==
Ragtime composer Scott Joplin was born in 1868 near Texarkana, and later became famous playing music halls in Missouri.

Gene Austin was born in Gainesville in 1900. Austin popularized the song &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;, which sold more than 10 million copies. He is remembered as the original &quot;crooner&quot;, and was commonly known as &quot;The Voice of the Southland&quot;.

==Country music==

Texas has long been the birthplace of numerous country musicians and continues to host a vibrant country music culture. Texan honky-tonk musicians like Milton Brown and Bob Wills helped popularize Western swing, and modern artists like Asleep at the Wheel continue the genre&#x27;s distinct style. Other genres of country also evolved in Texas. Marcia Ball, born in Orange, Texas, combined country with Cajun influences. Ernest Tubb and his country song &quot;Walking the Floor Over You&quot; set the stage for the rise of stars like Lefty Frizzell and Johnny Horton. Ponty Bone, Joe Ely, Lloyd Maines, Butch Hancock, Terry Allen, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and Tommy Hancock, helped invent the 1960s Lubbock sound, based out of Lubbock, Texas. Mac Davis is a singer and songwriter from Lubbock who became one of the most successful country singers of the 1970s and 1980s.

Outlaw country is another offshoot that has its roots in Texas, with Texans like Waylon Jennings, Jerry Jeff Walker, Michael Martin Murphey, the Lost Gonzo Band, Gary P. Nunn, and Willie Nelson (attended Baylor University from 1954-1956 and studied agriculture) leading the movement, ably supported by writers like Billy Joe Shaver. It was this scene, largely based out of Austin, that inspired performers like Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt, whose poetic narratives owe much to the folk tradition and proved enormously influential on younger Texan artists such as Nanci Griffith and Steve Earle, who in turn inspired the alternative country scene. Tex Ritter and Jim Reeves both grew up in Panola County in East Texas. Bob Luman was born in Nacogdoches.

Kenny Rogers, from Houston, has a career spanning more than 50 years. His 1978 album &quot;The Gambler&quot; remains one of the most famous country albums ever released, having sold a reported 35 million copies worldwide. Also from the Houston area are Clint Black (grew up in Memorial), Robert Earl Keen (Sharpstown), and Lyle Lovett (grew up near Klein) and more recently George Ducas (grew up in Memorial).

Modern musicians like George Strait, from the San Antonio area, continue to carry on the tradition of country music in Texas. Strait &quot;The King of Country&quot; is a singer, actor, and music producer known for his unique style of western swing music, bar-room ballads, honky-tonk style, and traditional country music. He holds the world record for the most #1 hit singles by any artist in the history of music on any chart or in any genre, having recorded 60 #1 hit singles as of 2016.

Within country music, the distinct styles of singers such as The Randy Rogers Band, Robert Earl Keen, Kevin Fowler, Cory Morrow, Jack Ingram, George Ducas, Jerry Jeff Walker, Pat Green, Wade Bowen, Rich O’Toole &amp; the Eli Young Band and others are often dubbed &quot;Texas music&quot;.

The Texas Country Music Hall of Fame is located in Carthage, Texas.

==Zydeco==

Zydeco, a musical genre that evolved in Southwest Louisiana by French Creole speakers, is popular in Southeast Texas cities in Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange. It was brought to the region by early pioneers of the music like Clifton Chenier who relocated in the late 1940s and early 1950s during the region&#x27;s oil boom when many Creole and Cajun people moved seeking better employment opportunities. 

==Texas blues==
The blues originated in the Mississippi Delta and spread to Texas by the 20th century. The original audience was African-American workers at lumber camps and oilfields. When the Great Depression hit, many musicians moved to cities including Houston and Galveston, where they created a style known as Texas blues. Blind Lemon Jefferson (in and around Dallas) was the first major artist of the field, and he was followed by others such as Henry Thomas, Blind Willie Johnson (who was principally a gospel singer), Big Mama Thornton, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Mance Lipscomb, and T-Bone Walker, as well as Melvin Jackson, Alger &quot;Texas&quot; Alexander, Little Hat Jones, Buster Pickens, Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson, and Goree Carter. Freddie King, born in Gilmer, was active from the 1950s to the mid-1970s.

By the 1970s, Texas blues had lost much of its original popularity, but was eventually revived by the blues rock stylings of artists including John Nitzinger, Johnny Winter, Edgar Winter, ZZ Top, Bugs Henderson, and The Fabulous Thunderbirds, who set the stage for a 1980s blues revival led by Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert Collins.

===Boogie-woogie===

Boogie-woogie is a music genre that became popular during the late 1920s, developed in the 1870s. It was eventually extended from piano, to piano duo and trio, guitar, big band, country and western music, and gospel. While the blues traditionally expresses a variety of emotions, boogie-woogie is mainly associated with dancing.

==Rock==
Goree Carter&#x27;s &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; (1949) has been cited by several writers as the first rock and roll record. It featured an over-driven electric guitar style similar to that of Chuck Berry years later. The song was recorded in Houston, where Carter was born and lived most of his life.

One of the first major Texan musical stars was Buddy Holly, who was born in Lubbock in 1936, died in the 1959 plane crash, and is buried in Lubbock. Another rock and roll singer, Roy Orbison, from Wink, Texas, also became popular in the 1950s. He was followed by Buddy Knox, Bobby Fuller, and Dallas rockabilly stars Gene Summers, Johnny Carroll, and Ronnie Dawson. Southern soul singer Joe Tex was born in Rogers, Texas.

The 1960s witnessed many influential rock artists such as Janis Joplin, from Port Arthur; she is ranked #46 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Doug Sahm&#x27;s Sir Douglas Quintet released several influential performances, as did psychedelic rock underground legends 13th Floor Elevators, led by Roky Erickson. Garage rock band The Heart Beats, formed in 1966, were based in Lubbock. The hard rock of ZZ Top was born out of the bands American Blues and Moving Sidewalks in Houston in 1969. In 1971, Bloodrock, from Fort Worth, released &quot;D.O.A.&quot;, which became a major international hit. Don Henley of the Eagles grew up in Linden.

===Psychedelic rock===
The psychedelic rock movement of the 1960s and 1970s has deep roots in Texas. The Thirteenth Floor Elevators were an American rock band from Austin, Texas, formed by guitarist and vocalist Roky Erickson, electric jug player Tommy Hall, and guitarist Stacy Sutherland, which existed from 1965 to 1969. During their career, the band released four LPs and seven 45s for the International Artists record label. Bubble Puppy was formed in 1966 in San Antonio by Rod Prince and Roy Cox. The name &quot;Bubble Puppy&quot; was taken from &quot;Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy&quot;, a fictitious children&#x27;s game in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Bubble Puppy&#x27;s live debut was as the opening act for The Who in San Antonio.

The Sherwoods were a Corpus Christi quintet that was popular from 1968 to 1969 and made two 45s on Smash Records in 1969. They were a psychedelic pop group, patterned after the Moving Sidewalks (featuring Billy Gibbons) and the Thirteenth Floor Elevators. Red Krayola and The Golden Dawn carried the genre into the 1970s, but as George Kinney of The Golden Dawn said, &quot;when the whole Elevator/Golden Dawn mystique was gone forever, at least as an actual presence on the Austin music scene. It all disappeared like a mysterious dream of super substantial reality, like the shadows of a once and future dawn.&quot; The front man of Red Krayola, Mayo Thompson, made a respectable career as a producer of some of the underground&#x27;s biggest names ― Pere Ubu, Primal Scream, The Fall, The Raincoats, and Scritti Politti to name a few. In the 1990s, the significant influence shown by notable rock pioneer Roky Erickson was honored in the 1990 Warner Brothers release of &quot;Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye: A Tribute to Roky Erickson&quot;, on which various rockers recorded his songs.

The Black Angels from Austin formed in May 2004; the band&#x27;s name derives from the Velvet Underground song &quot;The Black Angel&#x27;s Death Song&quot;. In 2005, the Black Angels were featured on a dual-disc compilation album of psychedelic music called &quot;Psychedelica Vol.1&quot; from Northern Star Records. Smoke and Feathers were formed in Austin in 2007. Austin Psych Fest was founded in 2008 by members of the psychedelic music scene, The Reverberation Appreciation Society, to honor the legacy of Austin&#x27;s musical history as the birthplace of psychedelic rock through the creation of a music and multimedia art festival.

===Punk rock===
Texas has long had a distinctive punk rock sound emergent from a number of urban scenes, especially those of Austin and Houston. Austin in particular has been considered a significant punk city; major venues there in the late 1970s and early 1980s included Raul&#x27;s, where the Austin punk/new wave scene began, spearheaded by the Skunks and the Violators in the first weeks of 1978. Other significant venues included the Continental Club on South Congress Avenue and the (now defunct) Club Foot Fourth Street downtown. The Skunks, which featured Jesse Sublett on bass and vocals, attracted significant attention to the scene because of their loyal following and also because touring bands, including Patti Smith, Elvis Costello, the Clash, Blondie, and others dropped in at their gigs at Raul&#x27;s and the Continental Club to jam with them.

Radio played a major role in spreading the sound and creating the culture of punk. In Houston, two pioneering radio programs in particular, Marilyn Mock&#x27;s &quot;S&amp;M Show&quot; on KTRU-FM and Perry Coma&#x27;s &quot;The Funhouse Show&quot; on KPFT-FM, were instrumental in helping create the punk scene in that city, through band interviews and playing import-only records, as well as the flamboyant personalities of the DJs. Local punk zines like &quot;XLR8&quot; and music weeklies such as &quot;Public News&quot;, and independent record outlets like Real Records, Record Rack, Record Exchange, and Vinal Edge not only brought in punk and &quot;new wave&quot; sounds from across the world, but they hosted in-store concerts where fans could meet the artists. The punk scene flourished in the early 1980s, led by the Skunks, the Big Boys, The Dicks, MDC, Really Red, The Degenerates, Mydolls, The Hates, The Judy&#x27;s, the Volumatix, DRI, Sik Mentality, the Killerwatts and Culturcide; so did the scene in Dallas, with groups such as The Telefones, NCM, Bobby Soxx &amp; the Teenage Queers, Bomb Squad, The Hugh Beaumont Experience and Stick Men with Ray Guns. Some notable Houston clubs were the Island, Cabaret Voltaire (a punk rock club in the warehouse district of downtown), the Apocalypse Monster Club (in the Clear Lake area near NASA), the Axiom (in one of the old Cabaret Voltaire locations), Fitzgerald&#x27;s, The Abyss, and Numbers (a predominantly new wave club). In the mid-1990s, post-hardcore act At the Drive-In formed in El Paso, along with its two offshoots, Sparta and The Mars Volta. Among some notable horror punk and psychobilly bands that hail from Texas are The Reverend Horton Heat, Horror Cult, and The Flametrick Subs.

===Alternative rock and metalcore===
Several alternative rock bands from Texas also reached mainstream popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included bands like Toadies (whose biggest hit, &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot;, was named for a lake west of Fort Worth), Flickerstick, Fastball, Butthole Surfers (from San Antonio; formed at Trinity University), The Duckhills, Tripping Daisy, Blue October, and, by the end of the 1990s, The Polyphonic Spree and Chlorine. In the 2000s, Bowling for Soup achieved significant popularity, as well as Burden Brothers, which was co-founded by Toadies lead singer Vaden Todd Lewis. Memphis May Fire formed in Denton. The New Bohemians, Forever The Sickest Kids, Crown The Empire, and Fit for a King are from Dallas. Myka, Relocate is from Houston. Kublai Khan hails from Sherman.

===Heavy metal===
The Arlington-area band Pantera went on to become heavily influential in the metal genre. Plano band Polyphia achieved considerable popularity as a progressive metal artist, culminating in collaborations with Steve Vai and BABYMETAL. A live version of Power Trip&#x27;s song &quot;Executioner&#x27;s Tax (Swing of the Axe)&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2021.

Other notable bands include Las Cruces, Brutal Juice, Drowning Pool, The Sword, Fair to Midland, Crown the Empire, Coilback, Oh, Sleeper, Fire From the Gods, Texas Hippie Coalition, Upon A Burning Body and Element Eighty.

Dallas-area industrial acts include RivetHead, The Razorblade Dolls, Echelon High, and Koppur Thief.

Texas has also been home to experimental/avant-garde music. In Houston, Black Leather Jesus is among the state&#x27;s earliest harsh noise acts, and B L A C K I E&#x27;s fusion of noise and hip-hop is considered by some to be a precursor to Death Grips. Also from Houston, Jandek&#x27;s music has been defined by its dissonance and atonality, qualities that have drawn comparisons to avant-garde composers like John Cage and Arnold Schoenberg. Other experimental/avant-garde artists of note have also hailed from Austin, with artists like Shit and Shine and Dromez originating, and power electronics pioneer Philip Best of Whitehouse currently residing there. 

==R&amp;B==
Singer Esther Phillips and pianist and singer Camille Howard were born in Galveston. Electric blues and R&amp;B guitarist, singer, and songwriter Barbara Lynn was born in Beaumont. She is best known for her 1962 hit &quot;You&#x27;ll Lose A Good Thing&quot;. Kelly Rowland and Beyoncé are from Houston.

The Houston hip-hop scene is known for the chopped and screwed sound invented by Screwed Up Click leader DJ Screw, and remains the location most associated with the style.

Vanilla Ice was born in Dallas, and grew up moving between Dallas and Miami. The D.O.C. is from West Dallas. He worked with Dr. Dre as an artist and writer. Christian hip hop artist D-Boy Rodriguez received moderate commercial success and was part of the burgeoning christian hip hop scene in Dallas and the rest of Texas in the late 80s, until he was murdered in 1990. Other rappers such as Big Lurch, Mr. Pookie, Mr. Lucci, Big Tuck, Dorrough, and Dondria also hail from Dallas. Rappers such as legends Lil Sin, and P.K.O. as well as Worldwide, Richie Branson, Cadillac Muzik, King Kyle Lee, and Mike Dimes all hail from San Antonio. There is also a burgeoning R&amp;B scene that includes alumni such as Destiny&#x27;s Child and Gary Clark, Jr., as well as up-and-comers Leon Bridges, The Suffers, Latasha Lee, Tameca Jones, and Alesia Lani among others.

==Tejano music==
Tejano music is the fusion of several different musical influences, such as Mexican rancheras, German polka, jazz, and zydeco, among others. Lydia Mendoza, Anselmo Martinez, Isidro López, Santiago Almeida, Flaco Jiménez, Freddie Fender, Rosita Fernández, Texas Tornados, and Narciso Martínez remain some of its most influential figures. La Mafia and Else Garcia paved the way for and built a strong Tejano foundation in Texas for Selena Quintanilla helped bring the genre more attention in the 1990s with one of the first Spanish to English crossover hits ever, adding influences from Mexican cumbia to the R&amp;B trend of the day. San Angelo band Los Lonely Boys fuse Tejano with contemporary blues and jazz.

==Opera==
Barbara Smith Conrad, born in Center Point, was an internationally acclaimed operatic mezzo-soprano.

==Major music scenes==

===Austin===
Austin&#x27;s artistic community helped popularize artists such as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac, The Police, and Elvis Costello in the Southwest. Tex-Mex/new wave bands Vallejo and Joe King Carrasco &amp; the Crowns gained some national fame. Local punk and new wave bands in the late 1970s included The Huns and the Skunks, along with The Delinquents, Standing Waves, and Jack Limbo. These bands soon clashed with an influx of hardcore punk bands like The Dicks, The Offenders, and Big Boys. Other notable Austin bands, such as ambient duo Stars of the Lid, eschewed this clash all together.

Austin, especially through its central music scene in the corridors of Red River Avenue, South Congress Avenue and 6th Street, has been dubbed &quot;The Live Music Capital of the World&quot;. The Texas Music Hall of Fame and Texas Music Museum are also located here. The Austin area is home to Austin City Limits Music Festival and South by Southwest (est. 1987), one of the largest annual music festivals in the United States. Austin has long been a hub of innovative psychedelic sound, from the pioneering Roky Erikson and the 13th Floor Elevators to the Butthole Surfers, and hosts an annual festival celebrating the genre and Austin&#x27;s contributions to it called Austin Psych Fest.

Austin is currently home to a number of bands that are enjoying popularity as part of the American indie rock scene. These include Spoon (singer Britt Daniel attended the University of Texas), Ghostland Observatory, ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, I Love You But I&#x27;ve Chosen Darkness, Explosions in the Sky, Okkervil River, The Black Angels, The Bright Light Social Hour, and White Denim, among others.

The transition of the Austin music scene from the mid-seventies progressive country scene to the punk/new wave and alternative influence that followed is captured in Jesse Sublett&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Never the Same Again: A Rock n&#x27; Roll Gothic&quot;, which details Sublett&#x27;s experiences with the Skunks and other bands during that time period. Sublett has also documented the Austin music scene in his music-themed crime novels, &quot;Rock Critic Murders&quot;, &quot;Tough Baby&quot;, and &quot;Boiled in Concrete&quot;.

===Beaumont-Port Arthur===
This area on the Gulf Coast northeast of Houston is also home to many legendary musicians: George Jones (d. 2013), Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown, Janis Joplin, Barbara Lynn, Edgar and Johnny Winter (d.2014), J.P. Richardson a.k.a. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot;, country stars Mark Chesnutt, Tracy Byrd, Clay Walker, and Jimmy and David Lee Kaiser, and rappers Pimp C (d.2007) and Bun B of UGK.

===Corpus Christi===
Known primarily for Tejano star Selena Quintanilla, Corpus Christi was also home to Reverend Horton Heat singer Jim Heath and garage rock band Zakary Thaks.

===Dallas===

Dallas has a rich musical heritage. The number of prolific musicians who played in the Deep Ellum Central Track area was rivaled in the South only by Memphis&#x27; Beale Street. T-Bone Walker, Lead Belly, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Willie Johnson, and even Robert Johnson himself first recorded in this area, just as Bob Wills and the Light Crust Doughboys were leaving the studio. In the 1960s, Dallas produced notable entertainers Trini Lopez and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Other notable musicians from Dallas include Erykah Badu, Cedar Walton, Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers, Mike Nesmith of The Monkees, The Polyphonic Spree, Old 97&#x27;s, St. Vincent, Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians, LehtMoJoe, Meat Loaf, Norah Jones, Willie Hutch, Baboon, The Secret Machines, Dorrough, The Paper Chase, Devourment, Absu, Course of Empire, MC 900 Ft.

===Denton===

The music culture that exists in Denton arose with the founding of the University of North Texas College of Music Jazz studies program in 1947, the first of its kind in the country. In the last 20 years Denton&#x27;s vibrant and diverse music culture has grown beyond the collegiate world of UNT&#x27;s College of Music. In 2007 and 2008, Denton&#x27;s music scene received feature attention from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Pop Matters&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; named Denton the best music scene in the United States in 2008. The Denton music scene received the #1 rank for &quot;Top 10 under recognized music locations&quot; in the world, on a culture blog called Listverse.

===Fort Worth===
From the 1960s to the 1980s, an independent label out of Fort Worth known as Bluebonnet recorded numerous albums of high-quality material by many pioneer artists in the country music and religious genres such as Bradley Kincaid, the Girls of the Golden West, Buddy Starcher, Yodelin&#x27; Kenny Roberts, and many other country music and gospel pioneers, many of whom had been popular on radio in the first half of the 20th century.

Before this, however, Bob Wills got his start just north of Fort Worth in Saginaw at the Light Crust Flour Mill. This is where Bob Wills, Leon McAuliffe, and Tommy Duncan first started playing music together. Wills recruited the Light Crust Doughboys and they later changed their name to Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys.

Free jazz pioneer Ornette Coleman was born and raised in Fort Worth, as were fellow jazz artists Ronald Shannon Jackson, Charles Moffett, Prince Lasha, John Carter, Dewey Redman, Julius Hemphill, and Cornell Dupree, all of whom attended I.M. Terrell High School, where G.A. Baxter was the music instructor.

In 1971, Bloodrock had 3 albums at once on &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;′s top 100 charts. After 8 albums on E.M.I./Capitol, they maintain a worldwide cult following. A co-writer of Bloodrock songs and hits, Johnny Nitzinger still plays local venues and creates recordings. Toadies&#x27; debut album &quot;Rubberneck&quot; went platinum in 1996. T-Bone Burnett grew up in Fort Worth. Nintendocore band Sky Eats Airplane formed in Ft. Worth.

Also, many songwriters of note have come from Fort Worth including Townes Van Zandt, Delbert McClinton, Ray Sharpe, Johnny Redd and David Persons.

===Houston===
Houston has been home to some of the more experimental music of Texas. From Mayo Thompson&#x27;s psychedelic free music group the Red Crayola and the experimental work of composer Pauline Oliveros to the hardcore rap of the Geto Boys and the primordial sludge rock of Rusted Shut, Houston has long been home for experimental music. The Pain Teens, Charalambides, and Richard Ramirez are among the better known Houston artists. Notable rising bands include Spain Colored Orange, Southern Backtones, Jennifer Grassman, and The Ton Tons. Among the city&#x27;s most influential punk bands were the hardcore Really Red and DRI. The local scene has also included Culturcide, Verbal Abuse, Stark Raving Mad, Sik Mentality, Dresden 45, Legionnaire&#x27;s Disease, The Hates, AK-47, The Killerwatz, Free Money, Asmodeus X, The Black Math Experiment, The Recipients, 30 foot fall, Gone Rogue, and The Degenerates. Houston is known for its chopped and screwed rap music, popularized by DJ Screw and the Screwed Up Click.

Houston also is the home of lo-fi music straddling blues, folk, and antiphonal traditions, as epitomized by elusive cult hero Jandek and the slightly more visible Jana Hunter. Houston is the birthplace and final resting place of Chris Whitley (1960–2005) who won a Grammy for his &quot;Living with the Law&quot;, revolutionized the steel dobro guitar, and enjoyed a massive cult following, but died prematurely of lung cancer in 2005. Houston is home to Beyoncé, Hilary Duff, ZZ Top, Kelly Rowland, and the other original members of Destiny&#x27;s Child. Houston is the birthplace of Grammy Award Winning Gospel Artist Yolanda Adams; who in 2009 was named the #1 Gospel Artist of the last decade by &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;. Jazz artists born in Houston include saxophonists Billy Harper and Walter Smith III, pianists Robert Glasper and Jason Moran, and drummer Eric Harland. Prairie View Co-eds formed at Prairie View A&amp;M University in the 1940s. Kashmere High School was home of Kashmere Stage Band from the late 1960s to 1978. Houston has had sizable folk-country and blues scenes dating back to the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, which included many now famous performers such as Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen (Lyle Lovett and Robert Earl Keen both attended Texas A&amp;M University) and Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Albert Collins, Big Mama Thornton, and Johnny Copeland who were signed with the hometown Peacock Records.

===San Antonio===
Still known primarily for Tejano music and Heavy Metal, San Antonio throws the &quot;Tejano Conjunto Festival&quot;, an annual three-day event celebrating Conjunto music, the largest of its kind in the world. Many of the Conjunto legends lived and recorded here. Names like Valerio Longoria, Santiago Jimenez Sr. and Jr., Flaco Jimenez (who has recorded with everyone from Bob Dylan to the Rolling Stones), Steve Jordan and many others.

San Antonio was also one of the major centers for Chicano Soul along with Los Angeles, California. Sunny &amp; the Sunliners cracked the Top Ten and were the first Mexican American act to appear nationally on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. Other significant Chicano Soul bands included Rudy &amp; The Reno Bops, Royal Jesters, Dimas Garza, The Dell Tones, Joe Bravo, The Lyrics, and Sonny Ace. At first thought, San Antonio, Texas, is not immediately associated with the development of jazz, yet the city does have a long and very creditable history. In the 1920s and &#x27;30s, many of the legendary territory bands played there as they swung through south-east Texas, among them Alphonso Trent and Tenrrence T. Holder. Resident in San Antonio itself for long periods was Troy Floyd&#x27;s band, sometime home to trumpeter Don Albert, and tenor saxophonists Herschel Evans and Buddy Tate. Floyd&#x27;s band regularly played at both the Shadowland Ballroom and the Plaza Hotel; from the latter, they were broadcast over station HTSA. When Don Albert later formed his own band, which included clarinetists and saxophonists Herb Hall and Louis Cottrell plus trumpeter Alvin Alcorn, they, too, played the Shadowland. Albert, incidentally, was the first bandleader to use the word &quot;swing&quot; in his billing: &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Swing Band&quot;. And drummer Clifford &quot;Boots&quot; Douglas formed his band, Boots and his Buddies, in San Antonio in 1932 and remained based there. Among individual musicians with long associations with the city were brothers Ernie and Emilio Caceres. Clarinetist and saxophonist Ernie played with many swing-era bands, including those led by Jack Teagarden, Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, and Woody Herman. After years in New York, where he played with Eddie Condon and Bobby Hackett, he settled in San Antonio, remaining there for the rest of his life. His brothers, the violinist Emilio and trumpeter Pinero, also played in San Antonio. Another member of the Caceres family, David, was a bop altoist at nightclubs throughout the 1990s.

San Antonio also spawned the Butthole Surfers, a hardcore alternative rock band which broke into the mainstream in the mid-1990s, signing to Capitol Records and successfully charting several singles and albums. Other successful acts born and bred in San Antonio are: Boxcar Satan, Two Tons of Steel, The Union Underground, Las Cruces, Sane, Hyperbubble and Fearless Iranians from Hell. San Antonio has deep roots in America&#x27;s classical music, Jazz, with KRTU-FM representing one of the most significant jazz radio stations in the country, and the Jim Cullum Jazz Band serving as a staple act on the San Antonio Riverwalk. Fellow college radio station, KSYM-FM, features &#x27;The Best of the Beatles&#x27; with Richard Turner, relying on one of the most comprehensive collections of Beatles recordings ever amassed to spin on his weekly show.

San Antonio is also home to Local782, a musician-led, non-profit initiative seeking to educate and empower Texas-based musicians by organizing events throughout the year, including seminars, performances, mixers, showcases, and fundraisers. A slew of new rock bands started in the 2000s have joined a couple longer-running favorites, Girl In A Coma - whose song &quot;Clumsy Sky&quot; won Best Punk Song in The 7th Annual Independent Music Awards - and Buttercup, to develop a burgeoning &#x27;indie&#x27; scene. These bands include: Blowing Trees, Morris Orchids, We Leave At Midnight, Cartographers, and Education, the last of whose 2011 album, &quot;Age Cage&quot;, was produced by Gordon Raphael, producer of the Strokes&#x27; &quot;Is This It&quot; and Regina Spektor&#x27;s &quot;Soviet Kitsch&quot;. Exponential Records has helped put San Antonio Electronica on the map, catapulting artists like Diego Chavez, a.k.a. Aether and Ernest Gonzales, a.k.a. Mexicans With Guns, to much wider audiences.

San Antonio has a thriving hip hop community as well, including emcee/producer Worldwide, the R&amp;B-tinged duo Mojoe, of Classic.Ghetto.Soul fame, the rapper Question, collaborator with Talib Kweli and Bun B on the track &quot;I&#x27;m So Tall&quot;, the producer/rapper Richie Branson, born Marcus Brown, whose clientele include Def Jam Recordings and Sony Music Entertainment, and the Vultures crew, whose album &quot;Desert Eagles, Vol. 1&quot; was praised by the San Antonio Current&#x27;s Best Music Advocate of 2010 as &quot;the most complete record to ever come out of San Antonio&quot;. San Antonio is also home to Texas Death core band Upon A Burning Body. Christopher Cross from San Antonio had 2 #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including &quot;Sailing&quot; in 1980.

===San Marcos===

<text>Te Rangihaeata ( 1780s – 18 November 1855) was a Ngāti Toa chief, nephew of Te Rauparaha. He had a leading part in the Wairau Affray and the Hutt Valley Campaign.

==Early life==
Te Rangihaeata, a member of the Māori iwi Ngāti Toa, was born at Kawhia in about the 1780s. His father Te Rākaherea was a war leader of his people and died at the Battle of Hingakaka fighting the Waikato and Ngāti Maniapoto iwi. His mother was Waitohi, the elder sister of Te Rauparaha and an important chief or ariki, and his maternal grandmother was Parekōwhatu of Ngāti Raukawa. Te Rangihaeata grew up in Te Rauparaha&#x27;s shadow and became his trusted ally. Te Rangihaeata&#x27;s sister was Rangi Topeora who was also a chief of Ngāti Toa and signed the Treaty of Waitangi at Kāpiti on 14 May 1840.

==Musket wars==
Te Rangihaeata rose to prominence during the period of intertribal fighting known as the Musket Wars. In 1819 while raiding the southern North Island the Ngāti Toa attacked Ngāti Apa at Turakina, near Bulls, killing many and taking several high-ranking captives, including Te Pikinga. They took the captives with them as they raided as far south as Wellington Harbour. As they returned north, they sought peace with Ngāti Apa, and Te Rangihaeata married Te Pikinga to conclude a peace alliance thorough a chiefly marriage. This was the beginning of a long-term association between the two tribes.

Arriving back in their own tribal territories the war party found that the Waikato and Ngāti Maniapoto Māori had decided the Ngāti Toa were undesirable neighbours and for a long time a state of war existed between them. Although greatly outnumbered and outgunned, Te Rangihaeata conducted a successful defence until Te Rauparaha was able to use his diplomatic skills to extricate the tribe. This was the beginning of their migration down to the Paraparaumu and Kāpiti Coast area. They subsequently conquered most of that region and the upper parts of the South Island, occupying and claiming ownership of the land by right of conquest.

This forcible change of ownership was to be a source of much confusion and conflict when the European settlers arrived and began buying land. There were often at least two sets of putative owners, and the ones who felt they had been dispossessed were often more than willing to sell land they owned but could not occupy.

Te Rangihaeata was not initially anti-Pākehā. He encouraged the whalers and the traders and was prepared to tolerate the missionaries. He valued them for the technology they introduced and the trade goods they were offering. But he quickly recognised that permanent settlers were a different matter, posing a serious threat to the Māori and their traditional ways. Despite that he tried to avoid open conflict.

==The Wairau==

When in 1843 Arthur Wakefield and the Nelson settlers were claiming the Wairau Valley, chiefs Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata visited Nelson and made their position very clear. Te Rangihaeata promised that he would kill any settlers who tried to take his land from him. Despite this they were prepared to follow the Pākehā legal procedures and await the decision of the Land Commissioner, William Spain. It was the Nelson settlers who jumped the gun and sent surveyors to the disputed land. Te Rangihaeata had his men firmly but nonviolently remove them, being scrupulously careful to return to them all their surveying equipment and personal possessions, but burning their thatch huts.

The Nelson settlers sent out a party to arrest the two chiefs on a charge of arson. The accidental discharge of a musket precipitated a brief battle, and about a dozen of the settlers were shot. The rest either fled or surrendered to the Māori. Among those captured were Arthur Wakefield and Henry Thompson, the two leaders of the arresting party. Several Māori had been killed, including Te Rongo, one of Te Rangihaeata&#x27;s wives who was also Te Rauparaha&#x27;s daughter. The captured settlers were promptly executed in accordance with Māori law and custom. However it was Te Rangihaeata who insisted on it. This incident became known as the Wairau Affray. The subsequent Government enquiry exonerated the Māori and decided that the settlers had acted illegally.

==The Hutt Valley==

A similar situation arose about three years later in the Hutt Valley near Wellington. The settlers were pushing forward aggressively and occupying land that had disputed ownership. Several years of active immigration and the arrival of British Imperial Troops had put the settlers in a much stronger position and much less inclined to tolerate either Māori claims or legal challenges to their occupation of the land.

Once again Te Rangihaeata became involved in the resistance, destroying the farms and the possessions of the settlers on disputed land, but not injuring anyone. However, the settlers did not recognise the warning and very soon open warfare broke out: the Hutt Valley Campaign.

Had the Māori been united, the subsequent history of New Zealand could have been different. Te Rangihaeata fought the British to a stalemate until the British were able to mobilise the Te Āti Awa and other iwi to oppose him. Additionally, the abduction and dubious arrest of Te Rauparaha did a lot to discourage the Ngāti Toa. They built a strong pā near Porirua and successfully withstood a British attack. They then retreated to swamps of Poroutawhao, out of reach of the government, and the war was over.

==Later life==

Te Rangihaeata remained at Poroutawhao until his death from measles on 18 November 1855. There are conflicting stories about this period, that he fiercely resisted any Pākehā penetration into the area and, alternatively, that he made his peace with Governor Grey. In his old age he took charge of the government-funded construction of roads in his area.

== Legacy ==
The Transmission Gully Motorway, opened in 2022, is officially named &quot;Te Ara Nui o Te Rangihaeata / The Great Path of Te Rangihaeata&quot; in honour of Te Rangihaeata.

<doc id="307724" wikidata="Q3088585" url="?curid=307724" title="Morning Edition">
<text>Morning Edition is an American radio news program produced and distributed by NPR. It airs weekday mornings (Monday through Friday) and runs for two hours, and many stations repeat one or both hours. The show feeds live from 5:00 to 9:00 AM ET, with feeds and updates as required until noon. The show premiered on November 5, 1979; its weekend counterpart is &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;. &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot; are among the highest rated public radio shows.

The show was hosted by Bob Edwards from its inception until it was retooled for a two-anchor format in 2004 with the introduction of Steve Inskeep and Renée Montagne. Montagne left the show in 2016, and was replaced by Rachel Martin, who stepped down from daily hosting in early 2023. Four regular anchors, including Inskeep, currently host the show on a rotating basis. A Martínez, who hosts from NPR West, joined on July 19, 2021, replacing David Greene, who hosted from 2012 through the end of 2020. Leila Fadel joined the anchor team in Washington at the end of January 2022, following the departure of Noel King. The network announced in early March 2023 that &quot;All Things Considered&quot; weekend host Michel Martin would be joining the &quot;Morning Edition&quot; team as its fourth anchor following Rachel Martin&#x27;s departure from daily hosting duties. She joined the show on March 27, 2023.

==Background==
A typical show includes news, both newscasts and in-depth reports; features on science, arts, business, sports, and politics; interviews with and profiles of people in the news; commentaries; and human interest features. Some regional public radio networks and local stations also produce locally focused content under their &quot;Morning Edition&quot; banner.

Bob Edwards, previously a co-host of &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, hosted &quot;Morning Edition&quot; beginning with its first episode, a job he initially took on a temporary basis when a shake-up in production and on-air staff occurred ten days before the show&#x27;s premiere. Edwards was joined by Barbara Hoctor, then of &quot;Weekend All Things Considered&quot;. Hoctor departed after four months, leaving Edwards as solo host for the next quarter-century. His last day as host was April 30, 2004; this was not due to Edwards retiring, but rather a highly controversial decision from NPR to reassign him as senior correspondent, which resulted in anger and harsh criticism from many listeners. 

From May 3, 2004, through November 11, 2016, the show was co-hosted by Steve Inskeep and Renée Montagne, with David Greene joining as co-host in 2012. Inskeep reports from NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., and Montagne reported from the studios of NPR West in Culver City, California, a municipality within Los Angeles County. Montagne announced in July 2016 that she would step down as co-host to become a special correspondent for NPR. On December 5, 2016, after Montagne&#x27;s departure, David Greene began broadcasting from NPR West, and Rachel Martin, former host of &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;, joined &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, broadcasting alongside Inskeep from NPR&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, D.C. By 2018, Noel King, formerly a correspondent for &quot;Marketplace&quot; and &quot;Planet Money&quot;, joined the anchors in Washington. Greene then departed, hosting his final episode on December 29, 2020, and was succeeded by longtime KPCC journalist A Martínez, who was added to the program in July 2021, to broadcast from NPR West. King left on December 10, 2021, with correspondent Leila Fadel named to succeed her in early 2022. Rachel Martin stepped down from daily hosting duties in early February 2023, to pursue a project within NPR focused on examining religion and spirituality. Michel Martin, weekend host for &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, was named as the next addition to the anchor team, and joined on March 27, 2023. 

Arbitron ratings show that over 12 million people listen to &quot;Morning Edition&quot; weekly. It used to be the second most-listened-to national radio show, after &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;, though some sources, among them &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot;, sometimes placed the show third in audience rankings behind &quot;Limbaugh&quot; and &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot;, depending on the time (as of 2015, Hannity has fallen behind &quot;Morning Edition&quot; in the &quot;Talkers&quot; estimate).

In 1999, &quot;Morning Edition with Bob Edwards&quot; received the George Foster Peabody Award.

==Format==

&quot;The following describes the program format effective August 13, 2018.&quot;

&quot;Morning Edition&quot; begins each hour with a sixty-second &quot;billboard&quot; highlighting stories to be covered in the hour. At least one birthday or anniversary of a major event is announced as well. Some stations replace this billboard with a localized version, with a similar format, but with emphasis on local stories and read by a local announcer.

The standard NPR newscast follows for five minutes. Stations have the option to cut into the newscast at three minutes (4:00 past the hour) to deliver a local newscast. A twenty-second funding announcement is followed by a ninety-second music bed, which is typically covered by all stations to deliver news, traffic, weather, or funding credits.

The first segment, &quot;A&quot; (duration 11:29), highlights the most important stories of the day. Usually the &quot;A&quot; segments differ between hours, although when the topic is extraordinary, the &quot;A&quot; segment will cover the same topic, but in a different format between the first and second hour. Segment A ends at nineteen minutes past the hour, and is followed by a ninety-second break, a promotion for &quot;Fresh Air&quot; and a funding announcement before the start of Segment &quot;B&quot;.

Between each segment, one- to three-minute breaks occur. These breaks are filled at the local station level with promotions for other programs, sponsorship credits, and station-provided content such as local traffic and weather reports.

Returning from the break at 21:50 past the hour, the second segment, or &quot;B&quot; segment, generally contains features, commentaries, or long form interviews. Interviews can sometimes take up the entire segment. Segment &quot;B&quot; ends at 29:00 past the hour, and a promotion for &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and a short music bed lead into a second full-length newscast at half past the hour. A one-minute music bed follows for a station break. 

The &quot;C&quot; segment follows at 34:35 and is sometimes covered by stations with local reports as well. This segment features news or cultural reports, generally running the segment length.

At 42:30 past the hour a two-minute music bed is played which most stations cover with news updates or &quot;modules&quot; from other independent radio producers.

At 44:30, a short humorous news item is introduced. These segments are called &quot;returns&quot;, because many stations that air local news or announcements return to the national feed at this point. The return lasts thirty seconds, and ends with the tagline &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, from NPR News,&quot; or some variation thereon.

At 45:35 past the hour, the &quot;D&quot; segment (duration 4:00) is typically composed of two to three stories focusing on health news, international events, or short updates on national stories. At 49:35 past the hour the segment ends, and another two-minute station break begins.

The &quot;E&quot; segment begins at 51:30 (duration 7:29) and differs between hours. Originally in the first hour, the &quot;E&quot; segment was dedicated to stories and features from the world of business, while in the second hour, segment &quot;E&quot; included a cultural feature, remembrance, or softer news story, usually taking the entire segment length. Beginning in November 2014, &quot;Morning Edition&quot; moved the second hour &quot;E&quot; features to the first hour &quot;E&quot; segment, dropping the dedicated business segment to allow many NPR stations to insert broadcasts of the &quot;Marketplace Morning Report&quot;, which is separately produced and distributed by American Public Media (prior to this change, many stations would already cover one or both &quot;E&quot; segments with &quot;Marketplace Morning Report&quot;). However, some stations continue to air &quot;Marketplace Morning Report&quot; in place of the &quot;E&quot; segment for the first hour. Segment &quot;E&quot; ends at 59:00 after the hour, and leads into a music bed that takes the listener into the next hour, or the end of the program, depending on the hour and the station&#x27;s program schedule. (Every other hour during the &quot;E&quot; segment, KQED pre-empts &quot;Marketplace Morning Report&quot; to air its own production, &quot;The California Report&quot;, featuring news stories of statewide regional interest; &quot;The California Report,&quot; which has a companion 30-minute weekend edition&quot;,&quot; is syndicated to other NPR member stations in California, including KCRW and KXJZ.)

Stations receive over their computers the daily rundown of stories before each program which allows them to plan their coverage and decide what stories they wish to replace with local content. The rundown is updated as necessary until the feed ends at noon Eastern time.

NPR experimented with a modified clock from 2014 through 2018, which notably replaced the standard-length newscast at half past with two shorter newscasts at 19 and 42 past. Member stations complained the clock was &quot;choppy&quot; and &quot;disjointed&quot;, that it did not have as many opportunities to insert local content, and that the placement of the humorous return after the half-past local news break was awkward.

==Differences in pickup times==
Most stations in the Central and Eastern Time zones run &quot;Morning Edition&quot; live from 05:00 to 09:00 ET, repeating one or both hours through morning drive time. Some stations run only the two hours, others run up to seven hours. The repeats are automatically fed through the NPR satellite, and are updated as necessary by NPR anchors in the studio when breaking news events occur. In the past, Edwards would stay at his NPR office until the program feeds ended at noon in case there was anything that required an update. Today, with four people capable of regularly anchoring the program, hosts can rotate out of on-air duties to report and produce feature reports that will air on later dates.

On the West Coast, &quot;Morning Edition&quot; can run for up to seven hours running from the first live feed with the subsequent re-feeds. For example, KPCC in Pasadena, California carries &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, from 02:00 to 09:00 Pacific Time. KPCC handles the re-feeds uniquely: instead of taking the re-feed from the satellite, they &quot;roll their own&quot; by taking the tape from the feed two hours prior, so that they can run the A and B segments of &quot;Morning Edition&quot; about three minutes earlier than rival KCRW in Santa Monica, which takes the re-feed direct from the satellite. In the event of a breaking news story, KPCC runs the same feed as KCRW.

KJZZ in Phoenix, Arizona carries &quot;Morning Edition&quot; from 03:00 to 09:00 MST (two hours behind Eastern Time in the winter months, and three in the summer, as Arizona does not follow Daylight Saving Time), but uses local announcers, news updates/features and traffic/weather reports starting with the 05:00 hour.

==Satellite radio==
&quot;Morning Edition&quot; (as well as its afternoon counterpart &quot;All Things Considered&quot;) is not carried on any of the public radio channels of Sirius XM Radio, the leading US consumer satellite radio provider; this is reportedly to reduce direct competition between Sirius XM and NPR&#x27;s local member stations, almost all of whom heavily use these flagship news programs to generate pledge revenue from listeners. &quot;Tell Me More&quot;, a daytime interview show hosted by journalist Michel Martin, with a focus on African-American issues, was featured on NPR Now, channel 122, from 2007 to 2014; &quot;The Takeaway&quot;, a competing news and interview program hosted by John Hockenberry (retired in 2017, currently Melissa Harris-Perry) produced by NPR member station WNYC New York and WGBH-FM Boston and distributed by Public Radio International, is featured on SiriusXM Public Radio, channel 205.

==Independence Day tradition==
Every Independence Day (July 4), NPR staff members (including hosts, reporters, and commentators) conduct a reading of the Declaration of Independence that is broadcast on &quot;Morning Edition&quot;. NPR began the annual tradition in 1989.

<doc id="307728" wikidata="Q2347079" url="?curid=307728" title="Steve Kirsch">
<text>Steven Todd Kirsch is an American entrepreneur. He has started several companies and was one of two independent inventors of the optical mouse. Kirsch has been both a philanthropic supporter of medical research, and a promoter of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.

==Education==
Kirsch received a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1980.

== Career ==

In 1980, Kirsch and Richard F. Lyon independently invented the first versions of the optical mouse. Kirsch has started several companies. In 1993, he founded the search engine Infoseek, which in 1999 was sold to the Walt Disney Co. He co-founded Frame Technology Corp., bought by Adobe in 1995. In 2002 he was CEO of Propel Software.

In 2005 he founded Abaca, which made a spam filter.

In September 2011, he started OneID to create a user-centric Internet-scale digital identity system using public key cryptography to replace usernames and passwords with a digital identity compatible with the NSTIC goals.

Sometime before March 2021, Kirsch started M10, which markets blockchains for banks, but the board asked him to step down in the summer of 2021 amid controversy generated by his statements on COVID treatments and vaccines.

== COVID-19 ==
In April 2020, Kirsch founded the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund (CETF) to fund research into off-label treatments for COVID-19 among drugs already having FDA approval for other diseases, donating $1 million himself and also fundraising from others. He recruited what &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; called &quot;a powerhouse board&quot; of scientific advisors including Robert Siliciano and management by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. By October 2021 the fund had made grants totaling $4.5 million to various researchers.

The fund found a &quot;promising candidate&quot; for further study in fluvoxamine, according to &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot;. After funding a successful small trial which ended in November 2020, CETF provided further funding for a Phase 3 trial, which as of October 2021 was analyzing data. Kirsch, frustrated that CETF&#x27;s scientific advisory board was not willing to promote use of the drug based on results of a small preliminary study, wrote a post on Medium titled &quot;The Fast, Easy, Safe, Simple, Low-Cost Solution to COVID That Works 100% of the Time That Nobody Wants to Talk About&quot;. Medium removed his access to the site, citing misinformation concerns. Kirsch also refused to accept the outcome of a CETF-funded study on hydroxychloroquine, which had found the drug ineffective; he eventually warred with CETF&#x27;s scientific advisory board over CETF&#x27;s treatment of both drugs to the extent that in May 2021 all 12 members resigned.

===Vaccine misinformation===
In May 2021, Kirsch posted an article online claiming that COVID-19 vaccines affect fertility, while also underplaying the vaccines&#x27; ability to prevent illness and death, both statements criticized by fact checkers as being inaccurate and misleading. In September 2021, speaking at an FDA meeting and identifying himself as CETF&#x27;s executive director, Kirsch claimed that the vaccines &quot;kill twice as many as they save&quot;; the FDA responded that Kirsch had misinterpreted data and that there was no evidence his statement was true. Reuters assessed the claim as false. In March, 2023 Kirsch reported that he&#x27;d offered a woman sitting next to him on a first class Delta flight $100,000 to remove her mask for the entire flight. She refused.

In October 2021, Kirsch founded the anti-vaccine group Vaccine Safety Research Foundation (VSRF), which created ads depicting deaths the group attributed to vaccines. Foundation advisors include Robert Malone, Peter McCullough, and Stephanie Seneff. Before this, in June 2021, Kirsch had appeared with Malone on the Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying podcast, which according to &quot;MIT Technical Review&quot; &quot;introduced Kirsch to followers of the &#x27;intellectual dark web and allowed him to access a &quot;large and receptive audience to his claims about a fluvoxamine conspiracy&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Kirsch and his wife, Michele, fund a charitable foundation, which by 2007 had given $75 million to different causes. Kirsch also was a noted contributor to Democratic Party related funds. In 2007, his personal fortune was estimated at $230 million; that same year he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and funded research into experimental treatments for it, eventually refocusing the family foundation on medical research. As of 1998 the couple lived in Los Altos and had two children.

<doc id="307734" wikidata="Q728615" url="?curid=307734" title="Irving Howe">
<text>Irving Howe (né Horenstein; ; June 11, 1920 – May 5, 1993) was an American literary and social critic and a prominent figure of the Democratic Socialists of America.

==Early years==
Howe was born as Irving Horenstein in The Bronx, New York. He was the son of Jewish immigrants from Bessarabia, Nettie (née Goldman) and David Horenstein, who ran a small grocery store that went out of business during the Great Depression. His father became a peddler and eventually a presser in a dress factory. His mother was an operator in the dress trade.

Howe attended City College of New York and graduated in 1940, alongside Daniel Bell and Irving Kristol; by the summer of 1940, he had changed his name to Howe for political (as distinct from official) purposes. While at school, he was constantly debating socialism, Stalinism, fascism, and the meaning of Judaism. He served in the US Army during World War II. Upon his return, he began writing literary and cultural criticism for the CIA-backed &quot;Partisan Review&quot; and became a frequent essayist for &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;politics&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. In 1954, Howe helped found the intellectual quarterly &quot;Dissent&quot;, which he edited until his death in 1993. In the 1950s Howe taught English and Yiddish literature at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. He used the &quot;Howe and Greenberg Treasury of Yiddish Stories&quot; as the text for a course on the Yiddish story, when few were spreading knowledge or appreciation of the works in American colleges and universities.

==Political career==
Since his City College days, Howe was committed to left-wing politics. He was a committed democratic socialist throughout his life. He was a member of the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League, joining it in the 1930s when it was under the influence of the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party, remaining with YPSL when it became the youth organization of Max Shachtman&#x27;s Workers Party in 1940, which he served in a leading capacity, for a time as the editor of its paper, &quot;Labor Action&quot;; he continued his activism with this political trend when it morphed into the Independent Socialist League 1949, but left this milieu later in the mid 1950s.

At the request of his friend, Michael Harrington, he helped cofound the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee in the early 1970s. DSOC merged into the Democratic Socialists of America in 1982, with Howe a vice-chair.

He was a vociferous opponent of both Soviet totalitarianism and McCarthyism, called into question standard Marxist doctrine, and came into conflict with the New Left after he criticized their unmitigated radicalism. Later in life, his politics gravitated toward more pragmatic democratic socialism and foreign policy, a position still represented in &quot;Dissent&quot;.

He had a few famous run-ins with people. In the 1960s while at Stanford University, he was verbally attacked by a young radical socialist, who claimed Howe was no longer committed to the revolution and that he had become status quo. Howe turned to the student and said, &quot;You know what you&#x27;re going to be? You&#x27;re going to be a dentist.&quot;

==Writer==
Known for literary criticism as well as social and political activism, Howe wrote critical biographies on Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Sherwood Anderson, a booklength examination of the relation of politics to fiction, and theoretical essays on Modernism, the nature of fiction, and social Darwinism.

He was also among the first to re-examine the work of Edwin Arlington Robinson and lead the way to establishing Robinson&#x27;s reputation as one of the 20th century&#x27;s great poets. His writing portrayed his dislike of capitalist America.

He wrote many influential books throughout his career, such as &quot;Decline of the New&quot;, &quot;World of our Fathers&quot;, &quot;Politics and the Novel&quot; and his autobiography &quot;A Margin of Hope&quot;. He also wrote a biography of Leon Trotsky, who was one of his childhood heroes.

Howe&#x27;s exhaustive multidisciplinary history of Eastern European Jews in America, &quot;World of Our Fathers&quot;, is considered a classic of social analysis and general scholarship. Howe explores the socialist Jewish New York from which he came. He examines the dynamic of Eastern European Jews and the culture they created in America. &quot;World of our Fathers&quot; won the 1977 National Book Award in History and the National Jewish Book Award in the History category.

He also edited and translated many Yiddish stories and commissioned the first English translation of Isaac Bashevis Singer for the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. In that regard, he was critical of Philip Roth&#x27;s early works, &quot;Goodbye Columbus&quot; and &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, as philistine and vulgar caricatures of Jewish life that pandered to the worst anti-semitic stereotypes.

In 1987, Howe was a recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship.

==Personal life and death==
After marriages to Thalia Phillies and Alana Mack ended in divorce, Howe married Ilana Weiner. From his marriage to Phillies, a classicist, he had two children, Nina and Nicholas (1953-2006).

Howe died from cardiovascular disease at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on May 5, 1993, at the age of 72.

==Legacy==
He had strong political views that he would ferociously defend. Morris Dickstein, a professor at Queens College referred to Howe as a &quot;counterpuncher who tended to dissent from the prevailing orthodoxy of the moment, whether left or right, though he himself was certainly a man of the left.&quot;

Leon Wieseltier, who was the literary editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, said of Howe: &quot;He lived in three worlds, literary, political and Jewish, and he watched all of them change almost beyond recognition.&quot;

And Richard Rorty, American philosopher of note, dedicated his well-known work, &quot;Achieving Our Country&quot; (1999), to Howe&#x27;s memory.

He appeared as himself in Woody Allen&#x27;s mockumentary &quot;Zelig&quot;.

<doc id="307767" wikidata="Q233745" url="?curid=307767" title="Beatrice of Portugal">
<text>Beatrice (, ; 7–13 February 1373 – ) was the only surviving legitimate child of King Ferdinand I of Portugal and his wife, Leonor Teles. She became Queen consort of Castile by marriage to King John I of Castile. Following her father&#x27;s death without a legitimate male heir, she claimed the Portuguese throne but lost her claim to her uncle, who became King John I of Portugal, founder of the House of Aviz.

During her early years, Beatrice was a pawn in the changing politics of foreign alliances of her father, who negotiated successive marriages for her. She would eventually marry King John I of Castile, by whom Beatrice became Queen Consort of Castile. At the death of her father, Beatrice was proclaimed Queen regnant of Portugal and her mother assumed the regency in her name. Opposition to the regency, fear of the Castilian domination and loss of Portuguese independence led to a popular rebellion and civil war between the late King Ferdinand I&#x27;s illegitimate brother, John of Aviz, who wrested control of the regency from the dowager queen, and the supporters of Beatrice and her husband, John I of Castile, who claimed the throne of Portugal by right of his wife. In 1385, John of Aviz was proclaimed King of Portugal, and the King of Castile was definitively defeated in the Battle of Aljubarrota, effectively ending any prospects for Beatrice and her husband to assert their rights to the Portuguese crown.

From that time, Queen Beatrice took a special interest in the welfare of the Portuguese exiles in Castile who had been faithful to her dynastic claim to the Portuguese throne. After the death of her husband, she was relegated to a secondary level in the Castilian court. However, the dynastic strife continued to represent a challenge to the normalization of relations between Castile and Portugal. From the second decade of the 15th century onwards, her documentary trail became scarce until she completely disappeared about 1420.

==Life==

===Early years and betrothals===

Beatrice was born in Coimbra, during the brief siege of the city by Castilian troops during the second Fernandine War (1372–73). The siege was lifted and King Henry II of Castile continued to Santarém and then Lisbon. During the siege of Lisbon, Cardinal legate Guido of Bologna obtained an agreement between the Kings of Castile and Portugal, the Peace of Santarém. According to that treaty, King Ferdinand I of Portugal would abandon the &quot;Petrist&quot; cause, his claim to dynastic legitimacy that originated after the assassination of King Peter I of Castile in 1369. Two marriages were celebrated between the two royal families to reinforce the peace: between Sancho Alfonso, 1st Count of Alburquerque, brother of Henry, and Beatrice, half-sister of Ferdinand, and between Alfonso Enríquez, Henry&#x27;s natural son, and Ferdinand&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Isabel. In addition, a betrothal was arranged between Beatrice, Ferdinand I of Portugal&#x27;s newborn daughter, and Fadrique, created Duke of Benavente, another natural son of King Henry II of Castile.

The Cortes de Leiria of 1376 pledged to support Beatrice as heiress of the throne, accepting her betrothal with the Duke of Benavente. The betrothal was solemnized in Leiria on 24 November 1376, and on 3 January 1377 was accepted by King Henry II.

Fernando I&#x27;s will of 1378 ratified all agreements concerning Beatrice, adding that in the absence of Beatrice or any descendants, the Portuguese king&#x27;s half-brothers, the children of Inês de Castro (John, Diniz and Beatrice) were disinherited, and the throne of Portugal would pass to any hypothetical sisters of Beatrice, and after them, to Duke Fadrique of Benavente. To ensure the succession of the throne in her daughter, Queen Leonor Teles devised a plot against John of Portugal, in which the Queen&#x27;s own sister María Teles, John&#x27;s wife, was accused of adultery and killed by her husband in June 1379. Although John later obtained the royal pardon, he opted to flee to Castile, fearful of the Teles family.

In May 1379 King Henry II of Castile died and his son John I succeeded him. Once these events were known in the Portuguese court, negotiations began for the betrothal of Beatrice with the first-born son of the new King, the future Henry III of Castile, in order to counter any aspiration of John of Portugal to the throne with the political and military support of the Castilians. The 21 May 1380 agreement stipulated that the wedding would be celebrated when the 1-year-old prince reached the age of 14. It also established the succession. If Beatrice died before the marriage and her father had no more legitimate offspring, the throne would pass to John I of Castile, but if she died after her marriage and without any descendants, it would go to her widower. If Henry died first, without issue by Beatrice, she would remain Queen regnant, but were she then to die without children by a subsequent marriage, the Portuguese throne would pass to the Kings of Castile. In this way the children of Inês de Castro were again denied succession. The marriage agreement was approved in the Cortes de Soria in August 1380.

By July 1380, Ferdinand I had changed his politics by secretly allying himself in the Treaty of Estremoz with King Richard II of England and the Duke of Lancaster, defenders of the &quot;Petrist&quot; cause. The King of Portugal abandoned Antipope Clement VII and swore obedience to Pope Urban VI, while his daughter Beatrice was betrothed to Edward of Norwich, son of the Earl of Cambridge and grandson of King Peter I of Castile. The negotiations for this alliance brought to Portugal a &quot;Petrist&quot; exile, Juan Fernández de Andeiro, Count of Ourém, who would later have prominent influence at the Portuguese court. When the Castilian King heard of the agreement thanks to the exiled John of Portugal, he sealed an alliance with France through the Treaty of Vincennes, accepting obedience of his kingdom to the Antipope Clement VII, and he undertook the third Fernandine War. While King Ferdinand I and his counselors were at Elvas to discuss the war, on 19 July 1382 Queen Leonor Teles gave birth a son who lived only four days. One month later, on 10 August, the war was concluded with the Peace of Elvas, under which a betrothal was celebrated between Beatrice and the second son of John I of Castile, the future Ferdinand I of Aragon. In addition, the Kingdom of Portugal, religiously divided by the Western Schism, returned to the obedience of Antipope Clement.

John I of Castile was widowed in 1382, and the Count of Ourém, favorite of Queen Leonor Teles, negotiated a new betrothal for Beatrice, this time with the Castilian King himself. Ferdinand agonized over the proposed marriage. It would seem to secure the succession of Beatrice, because she would have a powerful neighboring monarch as an ally who could counteract the aspirations of John of Portugal and his siblings instead of supporting them, yet on the other hand the Castilian King, having to reside in Castile, would have to leave the affairs of Portugal in the hands of Queen Leonor as regent. The marriage contract was signed on 2 April 1383 in Salvaterra de Magos. The contract stipulated that at the death of Ferdinand I without sons, the crown would pass to Beatrice, and her husband would be titled King of Portugal. However, both sides agreed that the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal would not unite, and to guarantee this Queen Leonor Teles would remain as regent and in charge of the government of Portugal until Beatrice had a son who reached 14 years of age, who would then assume the government and title of King of Portugal in place of his parents. If Beatrice died without surviving children, the crown would pass to other hypothetical sisters, and if there were none it would pass to John I of Castile, and through him to his son Prince Henry, again disinheriting the children of Inês de Castro. The succession of Castile also was stipulated: in case the succession of John and of his two sons failed, the crown would pass to his sister Eleanor, and if she also died without offspring, the Castilian throne would pass to King Ferdinand I Portugal and his descendants. During the preparation of the marriage contract, the King of Castile objected to the dowry assigned to Beatrice and also disagreed that his sons by her had to be raised in Portugal, that Queen Leonor Teles could hold the regency in Portugal, and that the border fortresses had to be in Portuguese hands, but in view that it offered him the Kingdom of Portugal, these objections were viewed as secondary and he accepted the agreement.

Pedro de Luna, a pontifical legate for the Kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Portugal and Navarre, solemnized the betrothal at Elvas on 14 May 1383, and the official wedding ceremony took place on 17 May in Badajoz Cathedral. To ensure compliance with the Treaty, on 21 May a group of Castilian knights and prelates swore to denaturalize from the Kingdom and fight against their monarch if the Castilian King broke the agreements made in the marriage contract, and in the same way a group of Portuguese knights and prelates (among them the Master of Aviz) made the same oath if the Portuguese King broke the treaty with Castile. Later, Beatrice approved in her own name what was agreed at Salvaterra de Magos. Once the wedding took place, she went to live in Castile with her husband. The marriage contract was taken to the Cortes de Santarém of August and September to swear to accept Beatrice and John I of Castile as heirs of Portugal, although these acts were not conserved. For her part, Queen Leonor Teles gave birth on 27 September to a daughter who lived only a few days, so Beatrice remained the only legitimate child of King Ferdinand I.

===Crisis of 1383–1385===

King Ferdinand I of Portugal died on 22 October 1383. Leonor Teles, his widow, in accordance with the Treaty of Salvaterra and the testament of the deceased monarch, assumed the regency and government of the Kingdom in the name of her daughter. The regent maintained her clique of Castilian &quot;Petrists&quot;, which strengthened an opposition faction that demanded that the Council of the regent only included councillors of Portuguese origin.

News of the death of the Portuguese King came to John I of Castile and Beatrice in Torrijos, and they immediately closed the Cortes in Segovia. The Master of Aviz wrote to the Castilian monarch urging him to take the Portuguese crown that belonged to him through his wife, and that the Master himself be made regent on their behalf. To avoid dynastic conflicts with John of Portugal (first-born son of Inês de Castro) the Castilian King imprisoned him in the Alcázar of Toledo, and there adopted the title and the arms of King of Portugal, which was recognized by Antipope Clement VII. Later, he convened the Royal Council in Montalbán and sent Alfonso López de Tejeda to Portugal with instructions to the regent to proclaim him and his wife King and Queen of Portugal.

The proclamation was made, but in Lisbon and other places like Elvas and Santarém, a popular rejection was expressed in favour of John of Portugal. John I of Castile decided to lead troops into Portugal to take possession of the Kingdom, against the advice of some members of his Council since it represented a clear contravention of the agreements made in the Treaty of Salvaterra. He had the support of Beatrice&#x27;s chancellor, Afonso Correia, Bishop of Guarda, who promised him the surrender of the land. John I thus entered Portugal with Beatrice to ensure the obedience of Portugal and the rights of his wife.

For John I of Castile, his marriage allowed him to maintain a protectorate over the Portuguese kingdom and the ability to prevent the English from becoming established in the Iberian Peninsula. In addition, the union of Castile and Portugal would benefit the Portuguese nobility, who would have a greater expectation of receiving land, titles and positions. Faced with this, the peasants, who had improved their standing as a result of the depopulation of the countryside, feared a reinforcement of the privileges of the nobility while the merchants, artisans, public officials and large sections of the lesser nobility feared their political, social and economic annulment in the face of an increase in the power of the Portuguese high nobility and the threat of a Castilian domination that favoured agriculture over trade. Combining opposition to the regent and her &quot;Petrist&quot; clique, the expectation of a commercial monopoly, and fears of Castilian dominion and loss of Portuguese independence, uprisings began in Lisbon in late November and early December. The Master of Aviz killed the Count of Ourém, a favourite of the regent, and after that, there was the uprising of the peasants against the government instigated by Alvaro Pais, in which Martinho Anes, Bishop of Lisbon, was murdered. The uprising spread to the provinces, claiming the lives of the Abbess of the Benedictine cloister in Évora, the Prior of the collegiate church of Guimarães and Lançarote Pessanha, Admiral of Portugal, in Beja, among others. The uprising had the support of the bourgeoisie but not of the nobility, who maintained their support of the regent.

Queen Leonor Teles fled from Lisbon with the court and took refuge in Alenquer. In Lisbon, Alvaro Pais proposed the marriage of the Master of Aviz with the Queen regent so they could jointly assume the regency, but she refused, and with the news of the imminent arrival of the Castilian King, the Master of Aviz was chosen Defender and Regent of the Kingdom on 16 December 1383, invoking the rights of John of Portugal, first-born son of Inês de Castro. The Master of Aviz constituted his own Council in which João das Regras appeared as Chancellor, and requested the aid of England; he also tried to besiege Alenquer, but Leonor fled to Santarém, so he immediately returned to prepare the defence of Lisbon. In Santarém, Leonor Teles proceeded to recruit an army and sought the help of her son-in-law the King of Castile to defeat the insurgents who didn&#x27;t accept her regency or recognize her daughter Beatrice as Queen.

John I of Castile acted to control the situation in Portugal, leaving a Council of Regency in Castile consisting of Alfonso of Aragon, Marquis of Villena, Pedro Tenorio (Archbishop of Toledo) and Pedro González de Mendoza (First &quot;Mayordomo&quot; of the King). In early January 1384 John I, together with Beatrice, invaded Portugal via the road to Santarém, following Queen Leonor Teles&#x27; call, and a few days later, on 13 January, he obtained from his mother-in-law her resignation of the regency and government. Thus the Castilian King assumed control of the government, and he organized a chancellery, a court, and an army composed essentially of Castilians. After this, many knights and castle governors came to pay homage to him and his wife Beatrice, such as those of Santarém, Ourém, Leiria, Montemor-o-Velho, Feira, Penella, Óbidos, Torres Vedras, Torres Novas, Alenquer, Sintra, Arronches, Alegrete, Amieira, Campo Maior, Olivenza, Portel, Moura, Mértola, Braga, Lanhoso, Valença do Minho, Melgaço, Vila Nova de Cerveira, Viana do Castelo, Ponte de Lima, Guimarães, Caminha, Bragança, Vinhais, Chaves, Monforte, Miranda do Douro, Montalegre, Mirandela, Castelo Rodrigo, Almeida, Penamacor, Guarda, Covilhã and Celorico da Beira, among others. However, Queen Leonor began to conspire against her son-in-law, and for this she was sent to the Monastery of Tordesillas. This provided the Master of Aviz with further justification for the revolt because the terms of the Treaty of Salvaterra had been violated, and in addition, it split the nobility that had mostly supported Leonor, with several of them, such as the Chancellor of the regent, Lourenço Eanes Fogaça, allying with the Master of Aviz.

Although he counted on the support of the majority of the Portuguese aristocracy, King John I couldn&#x27;t repeat the Castilian triumphs of the Fernandine Wars and failed before Coimbra and Lisbon. On 3 September 1384, he left garrisons in the cities of his supporters, returned to Castile and asked for help from the King of France. Beatrice also left Portugal for what turned out to be the last time. Meanwhile, the Master of Aviz attempted to seize loyal cities from his adversaries, and although he took Almada and Alenquer, he failed in Sintra, Torres-Novas and Torres Vedras. He then went to Coimbra, where he had summoned Cortes for March 1385. There, Beatrice was declared illegitimate because the marriage of her parents was considered invalid, and on 6 April they proclaimed the Master of Aviz as King John I of Portugal. After the Cortes, the new sovereign undertook a campaign to control the north of the Kingdom and thus obtained Viana do Castelo, Braga and Guimarães. John I of Castile again entered Portugal, this time via Ciudad Rodrigo and Celorico, but his army&#x27;s defeats at Trancoso and Aljubarrota in May and August 1385 represented the end of any chance to impose himself as King of Portugal.

At Aljubarrota the Castilian disaster was absolute: the King fled to Santarém and from there he descended through the Tagus river until he met his fleet around Lisbon, and in September, the Castilian fleet returned to Castile. John I of Portugal then gained control of the cities that were still opposed to him. He took over the region north of the Duero where Portuguese knights still maintained fidelity to Beatrice and John I of Castile: Villareal de Pavões, Chaves and Bragança capitulated in late March 1386, and Almeida in early June.

===Legitimism and truces with Portugal===

The Castilian disaster at Aljubarrota produced an exodus towards Castile of Portuguese clerics who had remained faithful to Antipope Clement VII (their maintenance being undertaken by Queen Beatrice, who also requested benefits for them from the Antipopes at Avignon) and nobles, who initially didn&#x27;t receive substantial compensation since they were expected to return to Portugal.

Aljubarrota also renewed the aspirations of the descendants of King Peter of Castile: his daughter Constance and her husband John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. On 9 May 1386, Portugal and England signed the Treaty of Windsor, and John of Gaunt, his wife and their daughter, Catherine of Lancaster, arrived in Galicia in July. John I of Castile immediately called the Cortes in Segovia to assure the defence of the Kingdom, and in addition, rehabilitated John of Portugal, the first-born son of Inês de Castro, entrusting him the regency of Portugal in his and his wife&#x27;s names, with the goal of undermining the position of his half-brother King John I of Portugal. Given the scant results of the Anglo-Portuguese campaign and the loss of support in Galicia, John of Gaunt and John I of Castile signed the Treaty of Bayonne on 8 July 1388, under the terms of which John of Gaunt and his wife renounced to all their rights over the Castilian throne in favour of the marriage of their daughter Catherine with the first-born son and heir of John I of Castile, the future Henry III. The interruption of the Hundred Years&#x27; War with the Truce of Leulinghem motivated the Truce of Monção on 23 November 1389 between Castile and Portugal, under which cities both sides had occupied were restored, but the dynastic claims of Beatrice remained pending.

The recovery of Portugal was still on the mind of the Castilian monarch; in 1390, celebrating Cortes in Guadalajara, he proposed to his Council his abdication to dedicate himself completely to Portugal. His death on 9 October 1390, generated a power struggle to constitute the regency, so the Portugal issue was postponed with the renewal of the truce in 1393. Throughout these struggles, they preserved the dispositions King John I had made in his testament, written at Celorico da Beira in 1385, that provided for the economic maintenance of the household of the now-Dowager Queen Beatrice, on which depended the Portuguese exiles who had followed her to Castile. The testament also made reference to the doctrinal part of the inheritance rights, but there is disagreement over their intent. Olivera Serrano indicates that John I recognized his wife Beatrice as the legitimate queen of Portugal, and as she died without legitimate descendants, the rights would be passed to Henry III, according to the terms of the Treaty of Salvaterra de Magos in 1383, while the mention of Papal arbitration was merely to dictate and ratify that the rights of succession over Portugal would indeed belong to Henry III after Beatrice&#x27;s death. Oliveira Martins indicates that the Pope had to decide who should be the ruler of Portugal after the death of the Castilian King, whether it should pass to Beatrice or to her stepson Henry III. The dynastic rights of Beatrice would for decades constitute an insurmountable obstacle to the normalization of relations between the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal, a situation that could only be completely resolved in 1431 after the signing of the Treaty of Medina del Campo. Beatrice&#x27;s presence in the Kingdom of Castile was beneficial to the aspirations of the House of Trastámara over Portugal because the Dowager Queen represented the dynastic legitimacy against the illegitimacy of the House of Aviz.

During the reign of Henry III there was a greater Portuguese exodus to Castile, the common factor of which was the rejection of the House of Aviz, and the Castilian King granted the exiles some compensation for their losses in Portugal. These exiles would reject good relations between the Kingdom of Castile and the House of Aviz, and also tended to maintain networks of kinship consistent with their allegiances, and thus the exiled adherents of Beatrice settled in cities where the Dowager Queen had influence, like Toro or Valladolid.

John I of Portugal reinitiated warfare between 1396 and 1399 to force favourable clauses in a peace treaty, but his results weren&#x27;t what he expected. In the negotiations that culminated in the truce of 1402, the Castilians persisted in maintaining the rights of Beatrice and proposed a marriage between her and Afonso, the first-born son of John I of Portugal, but this union was rejected by the Portuguese king. Henry III also raised his own inheritance rights in Portugal on the basis that Kings Ferdinand I of Portugal and John I of Castile had been maternal first cousins.

The death of Henry III in 1406 marked a new direction in the relations with Portugal. While the life of Beatrice in Castile didn&#x27;t change since the testament of the King indicated that the provisions made by his father for her should be respected, the government of the Castilian kingdom was now in the hands of a co-regency in the name of the infant King John II between his mother, Catherine of Lancaster and his paternal uncle, Infante Ferdinand; however, their political differences forced the division of the Kingdom of Castile between them for his administration. As to peace with Portugal, Catherine favoured her brother-in-law, the Portuguese King, while Ferdinand favoured the position of legitimacy, which maintained the cordiality between Beatrice and Ferdinand, her youngest stepson. The disagreement between the regents prevented peace with Portugal and the truces were renewed only in 1407.

The death of King Martin of Aragon in 1410 and Ferdinand&#x27;s aspirations for the Aragonese throne made him more conciliatory toward Portugal. Ferdinand still maintained the superiority and legitimacy of his family&#x27;s dynastic rights, but in the negotiations that developed into the provisional treaty of 1411, the dynastic question and the Western Schism remained separate from the settlement in other points of friction: the Castilians promised not to wage war with Portugal for Beatrice&#x27;s rights or the Western Schism, and agreed to suppress any claims by the exiles faithful to Beatrice over their confiscated property or indemnifications prior to the year 1402.

The problem concerning the Western Schism was solved at the Council of Constance (1414–1418). The new elected Pope, Martin V, recognized the King of Portugal, and thus in the bull &quot;Sane Charissumus&quot; of April 1418 he asked the Christian sovereigns to help the Portuguese monarch in his fight against the Saracens. The death of King Ferdinand I of Aragon in 1416 and the deposition of Antipope Benedict XIII in 1417, eliminated the only remaining support that Beatrice retained.

The power struggle in Castile between Álvaro de Luna and the Infantes of Aragon, brothers of King Alfonso V of Aragon, made Portugal a factor in support of the Infantes of Aragon, so Álvaro de Luna tried to eliminate this with a lasting peace. The Treaty of Medina del Campo of 30 October 1431 established that the rights of Beatrice died with her, and King John II renounced any rights that may have fallen to him through the kinship between Ferdinand I of Portugal and John I of Castile. In addition, the Castilian king accepted the House of Aviz as part of his family by virtue of the kinship between Catherine of Lancaster, mother of the Castilian King, and her half-sister, Philippa of Lancaster, wife of the Portuguese King. The Portuguese exiles in Castile were denied any rights or compensation in Portugal.

===Life in Castile===

In 1376, when Beatrice was sworn heiress to Portugal in the Cortes de Leiria, she received a patrimony for the maintenance of her own household, though it was controlled by her mother. The Queen&#x27;s favorite, Juan Fernández de Andeiro, was Beatrice&#x27;s First &quot;Mayordomo&quot;. Following her marriage, rather than including territorial incomes, the dowry of the princess consisted of money that King John I of Castile had to accept with the prospect of obtaining the Kingdom of Portugal. As a minor, her husband retained her custody, but since 1385, when she attained her legal majority, Beatrice was able to sign and seal her own documents.

As Queen consort of Castile, she maintained her household, in which Juan Rodríguez Portocarrero served as First &quot;Mayordomo&quot;, and her Chancellor was the Bishop of Guarda, Afonso Correia, who would be succeeded by the lawyer Vicente Arias de Balboa. Beatrice&#x27;s patrimony in Castile varied over the years since the Castilian monarchs had to reward other relatives according to the political interests of the moment. Some provisions concerning the patrimony of Beatrice in the testament of John I of Castile, dated 1385, couldn&#x27;t be fulfilled in 1392 when the regency of Henry III revised the testament. Although as the wife of the Castilian King, she had jurisdiction over Tordesillas, San Esteban de Gormaz, Cuéllar, Peñafiel, Medina del Campo and Olmedo, when she became a widow she only retained Béjar and Valladolid. In 1396, Henry III exchanged Béjar for Ciudad Real and the merindad of Valladolid.

Her marriage with John I of Castile was childless, although a son called Miguel is mentioned in several genealogies of the 17th and 18th centuries and even in some modern history books, probably representing confusion with Miguel da Paz, the grandson of the Catholic Monarchs. From 1390 Beatrice, now a 17-year-old widow, remained in the shadows, distanced from the intrigues of the court. Nevertheless, she still had a visible presence in the Castilian court, maintaining a relationship in a wider social circle than the group of Portuguese exiles. During the regency of John II of Castile, she settled in Ciudad Real, and as appears from her letters, she seems to have retired to Toro after the treaty of 1411. In 1409 she received the marriage proposal of a Duke of Austria, a member of the House of Habsburg. She rejected it since it would have led to the loss of her Castilian patrimony, which would have harmed her Portuguese exile partisans, and she needed to retain the ability to make the type of political marriage that would have been necessary for a hypothetical return to Portugal. Beatrice maintained a close relationship with her stepson Ferdinand (later King of Aragon), supporting his family, and especially Infante Henry, intervening to support his election as Grand Master of the Order of Santiago in 1410.

In 1419 Beatrice sent Juan González de Sevilla, professor of the University of Salamanca and later Bishop of Cádiz, to appeal to Pope Martin V asking for the type of permissions usually granted to a person preparing to die. No documentary evidence of her death has survived, but her properties were dispersed, granted to the constable Álvaro de Luna from 1420, and in June 1420 Toro appears to have reverted to the Crown. Juan González de Sevilla, who was in charge of representing Beatrice as her ambassador before the pope, stopped referring to himself in this manner from April 1420. In April 1423 a new truce with Portugal was agreed upon that discussed the inheritance and succession of Beatrice, which suggests she had already died.

===Status as monarch===

There has been some actual debate as to whether Beatrice should be counted as a monarch or not. In recent decades, a historiographical current of Spanish and Portuguese authors defend that she was titular Queen of Portugal between 22 October and the middle of December 1383. Some historians counted Beatrice as the queen of Portugal during 1383–1385. However, the majority of the Portuguese historians have argued that during the 1383–1385 period Portugal had no monarch, and in Portugal Beatrice is not counted as a queen regnant.

The Portuguese rebellion was not the only challenge to her accession, she also faced competing claims of her own husband. Many Portuguese nobles of the pro-Castillian faction also recognized her husband, King John I of Castile, as their &quot;jure uxoris&quot; monarch, rendering him vassalage and obedience, as, for example, did Lopo Gomes de Lira in Minho. As can be read in his 21 July 1385 testament written at Celorico da Beira, John identified himself as the king of Portugal and possible effective owner of the kingdom, saying that if he predeceased his wife, the Pope should decide whether Beatrice or his son (her stepson) Henry should be the sovereign of Portugal.

<text>Legio II Traiana, ( Second Legion &quot;Trajan&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army raised by emperor Trajan, along with XXX &quot;Ulpia Victrix&quot;, for the campaigns in Dacia. Records of the II &quot;Traiana Fortis&quot; have been recovered from Egypt dating to the middle of the 5th century. The legion&#x27;s emblem was the demi-god Hercules.

==Origins==
According to Cassius Dio, it was Trajan who raised both the II &quot;Traiana&quot; and the XXX &quot;Ulpia Victrix&quot;, but the details and order are not clear. H.M.D. Parker has argued that the XXX &quot;Ulpia&quot; was raised first, at the time there were 29 legions, then after Legio XXI &quot;Rapax&quot; vanished—either destroyed in battle against barbarian invaders or in a civil disturbance—the II Traiana came into existence.

The date of the legion&#x27;s creation is also not certain, although Graham Webster assigns it to the year 101. The earliest dated inscription referring to the legion, which lists the posts Lucius Cossonius Gallus held during his career, again entangles the XXI &quot;Rapax&quot; in the origins of this legion, for Gallus was first a military tribune with the first unit, then some years later commissioned commander of the II &quot;Traiana&quot; most likely after he had distinguished himself in Trajan&#x27;s First Dacian War. About the only firm date is that Legio II &quot;Traiana&quot; was in existence by 108, the year Gallus was suffect consul.

==Campaigns==
===Parthian Campaign and Judean revolts===
In 115, Legio II &quot;Traiana Fortis&quot; was added to the large army of Trajan&#x27;s Parthian Campaign. In 117, the legion was allocated in Judaea, to ensure the peace. During a period of strife with Parthia in 123, Tiberius Claudius Quartinus led a &quot;vexillatio&quot;, or detachment, drawn from II Traiana and Legio III Cyrenaica to the banks of the Euphrates River ahead of the emperor Hadrian&#x27;s entourage. In 125, they were sent to Aegyptus for the first time, to share camp in Nicopolis (next to Alexandria), together with XXII &quot;Deiotariana&quot;. Between 132 and 136 they were again in Judaea to deal with the Bar Kokhba Revolt. An inscription dated to the reign of Marcus Aurelius attests that by that time the II &quot;Traiana&quot; was the only legion stationed in Roman Egypt.

===Siege in Alexandria===
The legion was in its base in Nicopolis when south Egypt revolted against Roman rule. In the ensuing Bucolic War, Alexandria was besieged for months. Despite plague and famine, the defenders remained resolute.

Rescue for the &quot;Traiana&quot; came when Avidius Cassius arrived with the legions of Syria in 172. The legion was awarded the cognomen &quot;Fortis&quot; (&quot;valiant&quot;) for the valiant defense of &quot;Rome&#x27;s Bread Basket&quot;. Cassius was ruler of the east for a time, while Marcus Aurelius was busy in his Marcomannic Wars.

Thinking that his emperor was dead, Cassius declared himself emperor with the blessing of Aurelius&#x27; wife; however, the legion learned that Aurelius was leading the legions of the Danube to fight the rebels. The legion, with the others, cut off Cassius&#x27; head and sent it to Aurelius, who took no punitive action against the troops.

===Syrian Rebellion===
The history of II &quot;Traiana Fortis&quot; gives an example of the political role of the legions. In 194, Pescennius Niger, governor of the province of Syria, rebelled with the support of, among others, II &quot;Traiana Fortis&quot;. His rival was Septimius Severus who would become emperor. In the days before the final battle, the legion changed sides and vowed fidelity to Severus. This would prove to be decisive for Pescennius&#x27; defeat.

===Campaign Against the Germanic Tribes===
In the beginnings of the 3rd century, the legion was involved in Caracalla&#x27;s campaign against Germanic tribes and received the cognomen Germanica.

===Move to Apollonopolis Magna===
According to &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (composed c. 400), in early 5th century II &quot;Traiana Fortis&quot; was moved to Apollonopolis Magna, in the southern part of Aegyptus, and later served, at least with some &quot;vexillationes&quot;, under the &quot;Comes limitis Aegypti&quot;.

<doc id="307775" wikidata="Q1184545" url="?curid=307775" title="Delmore Schwartz">
<text>Delmore Schwartz (December 8, 1913 – July 11, 1966) was an American poet and short story writer.

==Early life==
Schwartz was born in 1913 in Brooklyn, New York, where he also grew up. His parents, Harry and Rose, both Romanian Jews, separated when Schwartz was nine, and their divorce had a profound effect on him. He had a younger brother, Kenneth. In 1930, Schwartz&#x27;s father suddenly died at the age of 49. Though Harry had accumulated a good deal of wealth from his dealings in the real estate business, Delmore inherited only a small amount of that money as the result of the shady dealings of the executor of Harry&#x27;s estate. According to Schwartz&#x27;s biographer, James Atlas, &quot;Delmore continued to hope that he would eventually receive his legacy [even] as late as 1946.&quot;

Schwartz spent time at Columbia University and the University of Wisconsin before graduating with a B.A. from New York University in 1935. He then did some graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University, where he studied with the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, left and returned to New York without receiving a degree. He also had expressed feeling rejected by the English department at Harvard on account of his Jewish identity.

In 1937, he married Gertrude Buckman, a book reviewer for &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, whom he divorced after six years.

==Career in writing==

Soon thereafter, he made his parents&#x27; disastrous marriage the subject of his most famous short story, &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities&quot;, which was published in 1937 in &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. This story and other short stories and poems became his first book, also titled &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities&quot;, published in 1938 when Schwartz was only 25 years old. The book was well received, and made him a well-known figure in New York intellectual circles. His work received praise from some of the most respected people in literature, including T. S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams, and Ezra Pound, and Schwartz was considered one of the most gifted and promising young writers of his generation. According to James Atlas, Allen Tate responded to the book by stating that &quot;[Schwartz&#x27;s] poetic style marked &#x27;the first real innovation we&#x27;ve had since Eliot and Pound.&#x27;&quot;

For the next couple of decades, he continued to publish stories, poems, plays, and essays, and edited the &quot;Partisan Review&quot; from 1943 to 1955, as well as &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Schwartz was deeply upset when his epic poem, &quot;Genesis&quot;, which he published in 1943 and hoped would stand alongside other Modernist epics like &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and &quot;The Cantos&quot; as a masterpiece, received a negative critical response. Later, in 1948, he married the novelist Elizabeth Pollet. This relationship also ended in divorce.

In 1959, he became the youngest-ever recipient of the Bollingen Prize, awarded for a collection of poetry he published that year, &quot;Summer Knowledge: New and Selected Poems&quot;. His poetry differed from his stories in that it was less autobiographical and more philosophical. His verse also became increasingly abstract in his later years. He taught creative writing at six universities, including Syracuse, Princeton, and Kenyon College.

In addition to being known as a gifted writer, Schwartz was considered a great conversationalist and spent much time entertaining friends at the White Horse Tavern in New York City.

Much of Schwartz&#x27;s work is notable for its philosophical and deeply meditative nature, and the literary critic, R.W. Flint, wrote that Schwartz&#x27;s stories were &quot;the definitive portrait of the Jewish middle class in New York during the Depression.&quot; In particular, Schwartz emphasized the large divide that existed between his generation (which came of age during the Depression) and his parents&#x27; generation (who had often come to the United States as first-generation immigrants and whose idealistic view of America differed greatly from his own). In another take on Schwartz&#x27;s fiction, Morris Dickstein wrote that &quot;Schwartz&#x27;s best stories are either poker-faced satirical takes on the bohemians and outright failures of his generation, as in &#x27;The World Is a Wedding&#x27; and &#x27;New Year’s Eve,&#x27; or chronicles of the distressed lives of his parents&#x27; generation, for whom the promise of American life has not panned out.&quot;

A selection of his short stories was published posthumously in 1978 under the title &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories&quot; and was edited by James Atlas, who had written a biography of Schwartz, &quot;Delmore Schwartz: The Life of An American Poet&quot;, two years earlier. Later, another collection of Schwartz&#x27;s work, &quot;Screeno: Stories &amp; Poems&quot;, was published in 2004. This collection contained fewer stories than &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories&quot; but it also included a selection of some of Schwartz&#x27;s best-known poems like &quot;The Heavy Bear Who Goes With Me&quot; and &quot;In The Naked Bed, In Plato&#x27;s Cave&quot;. &quot;Screeno&quot; also featured an introduction by the fiction writer and essayist, Cynthia Ozick.

==Death==
Schwartz was unable to repeat or build on his early successes later in life as a result of alcoholism and mental illness, and his last years were spent in seclusion at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. In fact, Schwartz was so isolated from the rest of the world that when he died in his hotel room on July 11, 1966, at age 52, of a heart attack, two days passed before his body was identified at the morgue.

Schwartz was interred at Cedar Park Cemetery, in Emerson, New Jersey.

==Tributes==

One of the earliest tributes to Schwartz came from Schwartz&#x27;s friend, fellow poet Robert Lowell, who published the poem &quot;To Delmore Schwartz&quot; in 1959 (while Schwartz was still alive) in the book &quot;Life Studies&quot;. In it, Lowell reminisces about the time that the two poets lived together in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1946, writing that they were &quot;underseas fellows, nobly mad, / we talked away our friends.&quot;

Schwartz&#x27;s former student at Syracuse University, Lou Reed, was the singer and principal songwriter for the band the Velvet Underground. Wanting to dedicate a song to Schwartz on their debut album, &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot;, Reed chose &quot;European Son&quot; as it had the fewest lyrics; rock and roll lyrics were something Schwartz abhorred.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 1/3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The song was recorded in April 1966, three months before Schwartz&#x27;s death, but was not released until March 1967. According to musicologist Richard Witts, the song &quot;reads like little more than a song of loathing&quot; toward Schwartz, who refused to see Reed while living at the Chelsea Hotel. Some pressings of &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; referred to the song as &quot;European Son (to Delmore Schwartz)&quot;.

Lou Reed&#x27;s 1982 solo album &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; includes his second Schwartz homage with the song &quot;My House&quot;. A more direct tribute to Schwartz than the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;European Son&quot;, the lyrics of &quot;My House&quot; are about Reed&#x27;s relationship with Schwartz. In the song, Reed writes that Schwartz &quot;was the first great man that I ever met&quot;.

In the June 2012 issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine, Lou Reed published a short prose tribute to Schwartz entitled &quot;O Delmore How I Miss You&quot;. In the piece, Reed quotes and references a number of Schwartz&#x27;s short stories and poems including &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities&quot;, &quot;The World Is a Wedding&quot;, and &quot;The Heavy Bear Who Goes with Me&quot;. &quot;O Delmore How I Miss You&quot; was re-published as the preface to the New Directions 2012 reissue of Schwartz&#x27;s posthumously published story collection &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories&quot;.

Another musician to pay tribute to Schwartz is Bono, the lead singer of the Irish rock band U2, who was inspired by the poet&#x27;s work when writing the lyrics of U2&#x27;s &quot;Acrobat&quot;. The song, from the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, is dedicated to the poet and in its final verse is quoted the title of his book &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities&quot;.

In 1968, Schwartz&#x27;s friend and peer, fellow poet John Berryman, dedicated his book &quot;His Toy, His Dream, His Rest&quot; &quot;to the sacred memory of Delmore Schwartz&quot;, including 12 elegiac poems about Schwartz in the book. In &quot;Dream Song #149&quot;, Berryman wrote of Schwartz, In the brightness of his promise,unstained, I saw him thro&#x27; the mist of the actualblazing with insight, warm with gossipthro&#x27; all our Harvard yearswhen both of us were just becoming knownI got him out of a police-station once, in Washington, the world is trefand grief too astray for tears. 

The most ambitious literary tribute to Schwartz came in 1975, when Saul Bellow, a one-time protégé of Schwartz, published his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Humboldt&#x27;s Gift&quot;, which was based on his relationship with Schwartz. Although the character of Von Humboldt Fleischer is Bellow&#x27;s portrait of Schwartz during Schwartz&#x27;s declining years, the book is actually a testament to Schwartz&#x27;s lasting artistic influence on Bellow. Although he is a genius, the Fleischer/Schwartz character struggles financially and has trouble finding a secure university teaching position. He becomes increasingly paranoid and jealous of the success of the main character, Charlie Citrine (who is based upon Bellow himself), becoming isolated and descending into alcoholism and madness.

Charles Bukowski wrote a biographical poem about Schwartz, published in his posthumous &quot;Open All Night&quot;. He characterized Schwartz&#x27;s writing:
his criticism was brilliant in its rancor and decisiveness;
he was really more of a bitch than a bard-
his poetry too fawning and delicate.
as a critic he was a good surgeon,
as a poet he was stalled in a kind of stale whimsy.

In 1996, Donald Margulies wrote the play &quot;Collected Stories&quot;, in which an aging writer and teacher reveals to a young student that she once had a great affair in her youth with Schwartz in Greenwich Village while Schwartz was in declining health from alcoholism and mental illness. The student then controversially uses the affair revelation as the basis for a successful novel. The play was produced twice off-Broadway and once on Broadway.

In John A. McDermott&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;The Idea of God in Tennessee&quot;, he includes a poem written for and referencing Schwartz, titled &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Body, Unclaimed in the Manhattan Morgue&quot;. The poem makes mention of Schwartz&#x27;s writing, daily habits, and death.

A play by Romulus Linney about Schwartz&#x27;s friendship with Milton Klonsky, Schwartz&#x27;s protege and friend and a writer of nonfiction, was presented at Ensemble Theater Company in New York City in November and December 2005, and at The Redhouse Theatre in Syracuse, NY, during its 2004/05 season.

In the final episode (8) of True Detective season 3, Wayne Hays&#x27; (Mahershala Ali) wife, Amelia Reardon (Carmen Ejogo), reads to her students &quot;Calmly We Walk through This April&#x27;s Day&quot;.

<text>Legio II Adiutrix (&quot;Second Legion, the Rescuer&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in AD 70 by the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79), originally composed of Roman navy marines of the &quot;classis Ravennatis&quot;. There are still records of II &quot;Adiutrix&quot; in the Rhine border in the beginning of the 4th century. The legion&#x27;s symbols were a Capricorn and Pegasus.

==History==

The first assignment of II &quot;Adiutrix&quot; was in Germania Inferior, where the Batavian rebellion was at its peak. After the defeat of the rebels, II &quot;Adiutrix&quot; followed general Quintus Petillius Cerialis to Britain to deal with another rebellion led by Venutius. During the next years, the legion was to stay in the British Islands to subdue the rebel tribes of Scotland and Wales, with base camp probably at Chester.

In 87, the legion was recalled to the continent to participate in the Dacian wars of emperor Domitian. Between 94 and 95, still in Dacia, later emperor Hadrian served as military tribune in the II &quot;Adiutrix&quot;.

In the summer of 106 the legion took part to the siege of the Dacian Capital Sarmisegetusa. After Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars of 101–106, the legion was located in Aquincum (modern Budapest), which would be its base camp for the years to come. Despite this, the legion or vexillations or subunits took part in:
* Lucius Verus&#x27;s campaign against the Parthian Empire (162–166)
* Marcus Aurelius&#x27; campaign against the Marcomanni and the Quadi (171–173)
* Marcus Aurelius&#x27; campaign against the Quadi (179–180). The Legion was commanded by Marcus Valerius Maximianus in Laugaricio.
* Caracalla&#x27;s campaign against the Alemanni (213)
* Gordian&#x27;s campaign against the Sassanid Empire (238)

In 193, II &quot;Adiutrix&quot; supported emperor Septimius Severus during his struggle for the purple.

<doc id="307781" wikidata="Q152136" url="?curid=307781" title="Germania Inferior">
<text>Germania Inferior (&quot;Lower Germania&quot;) was a Roman province from AD 85 until the province was renamed Germania Secunda in the 4th century AD, on the west bank of the Rhine bordering the North Sea. The capital of the province was Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (modern-day Cologne).

==Geography==

According to Ptolemy (2.9), Germania Inferior included the Rhine from its mouth up to the mouth of the &quot;Obringa&quot;, a river identified with either the Aar or the Moselle. The territory included modern-day Luxembourg, the southern Netherlands, part of Belgium, and part of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, west of the Rhine.

The principal settlements of the province were Castra Vetera and Colonia Ulpia Traiana (both near Xanten), Coriovallum (Heerlen), Albaniana (Alphen aan den Rijn), Lugdunum Batavorum (Katwijk), Forum Hadriani (Voorburg), Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum (Nijmegen), Traiectum (Utrecht), Atuatuca Tungrorum (Tongeren), Bona (Bonn), and Colonia Agrippinensis (Cologne), the capital of Germania Inferior.

==History==

The first confrontations between a Roman army and the peoples of Germania Inferior occurred during Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars. Caesar invaded the region in 57 BC and in the next three years annihilated several tribes, including the Eburones and the Menapii, whom Caesar called &quot;Germanic&quot; but who probably were Celtic or at least mixed Celtic-Germanic. Germanic influence (mainly through the Tungri) increased during Roman times, leading to the assimilation of all Celtic peoples in the area. In fact, Germania Inferior had Roman settlements since around 50 BC and was at first part of Gallia Belgica.

It was only under Domitian (r. AD 81&quot;–&quot;96) that new territories were acquired, between the high valleys of the Rhine and the Danube, following the campaigns conducted by his generals in AD 83&quot;–&quot;85, which led to the creation of two new imperial provinces, lower and upper Germany. Although this region had been occupied since the reign of Augustus, it wasn&#x27;t formally established as a Roman province until around AD 85, with its capital at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (modern-day Cologne). It later became an imperial province. It lay north of Germania Superior; these two together made up Lesser Germania. The adjective &quot;Inferior&quot; refers to its downstream position.

The army of Germania Inferior, typically shown on inscriptions as EX.GER.INF. (&quot;Exercitus Germaniae Inferioris&quot;), included several legions at various times: of these, Legions I &quot;Minervia&quot; and XXX &quot;Ulpia Victrix&quot; were the most permanent. The Roman Navy&#x27;s &quot;Classis Germanica&quot; (Germanic fleet), charged with patrolling the Rhine and the North Sea coast, were based at Castra Vetera and later at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis.

As attested in the early 5th century document &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, the province was renamed Germania Secunda (Germania II) in the 4th century. It was administered by a &quot;consularis&quot; and formed part of the Diocese of Gaul. Up to the end of Roman control, it was an intensely garrisoned province that was inhabited by Romans and Ripuarian Franks in the 5th century. Its capital remained at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, which also became the seat of a Christian bishopric, which was in charge of an ecclesiastical province that survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

After the final abandonment of the province it became the core of the Frankish Kingdom.

<text>The Battle of Aljubarrota was fought between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Crown of Castile on 14 August 1385. Forces commanded by King John I of Portugal and his general Nuno Álvares Pereira, with the support of English allies, opposed the army of King John I of Castile with its Aragonese and French allies, as well as Genoese mercenaries at São Jorge, between the towns of Leiria and Alcobaça, in central Portugal. The result was a decisive victory for the Portuguese, ruling out Castilian ambitions to the Portuguese throne, ending the 1383–85 Crisis and assuring John as King of Portugal.

Portuguese independence was safeguarded and a new dynasty, the House of Aviz, was established. Scattered border confrontations with Castilian troops would persist until the death of John I of Castile in 1390, but these posed no real threat to the new dynasty.

==Prelude==

The end of the 14th century in Europe was a time of revolution and crisis, with the Hundred Years&#x27; War between the English and the French for Western France, the Black Death devastating the continent, and famine afflicting the poor. Portugal was no exception. In October 1383, King Ferdinand I of Portugal died with no son to inherit the crown. The only surviving child of his marriage with Leonor Telles de Meneses was a girl, Princess Beatrice of Portugal.

In April of that same year the King had signed the Treaty of Salvaterra de Magos with King Juan I of Castile. The treaty determined that Princess Beatrice was to marry Juan I, king of Castile, and the Crown of Portugal would belong to the descendants of this union. This situation left the majority of the Portuguese discontented, and the Portuguese nobility was unwilling to support the claim of the princess because that could mean the incorporation of Portugal into Castile. Also, the powerful merchants of the capital, Lisbon, were enraged at being excluded from the negotiations. Without an undisputed option, Portugal remained without a king from 1383–85, in an interregnum known as the 1383–85 Crisis.

The first clear act of hostility was carried out in December 1383 by the faction of John (João), the Grand Master of the Aviz Order (and a natural son of Peter I of Portugal), with the murder of Count Andeiro. This prompted the Lisbon merchants to name him &quot;rector and defender of the realm&quot;. However, the Castilian king would not relinquish his and his wife&#x27;s claims to the throne. In an effort to normalize the situation and secure the crown for himself or Beatrice, he forced Leonor to abdicate from the regency. In April 1384, in Alentejo, a punitive expedition was promptly defeated by Nuno Álvares Pereira, leading a much smaller Portuguese army at the Battle of Atoleiros. This was an example of the use of the defensive tactic of forming an infantry square to repel cavalry, reportedly without any casualties to the Portuguese.
A larger second expedition led by the Castilian king himself reached and besieged Lisbon for four months in the summer of 1384, before being forced to retreat by a shortage of food supplies due to harassment from Nuno Álvares Pereira, and the bubonic plague.

In order to secure his claim, John of Aviz engaged in politics and intense diplomatic negotiations with both the Holy See and England. In October 1384, Richard II wrote to John (later King John I), regent of Portugal, reporting on negotiations, conducted in England, with John&#x27;s envoys - Dom Fernando, master of the order of Santiago, and Laurence Fogaça, chancellor of Portugal saying that an agreement had been reached under which a small English contingent was to be sent to Portugal, to help defend the kingdom against its Castilian neighbor. On 6 April 1385, (the anniversary of the &quot;miraculous&quot; battle of Atoleiros, a fortuitous date), the Council of the kingdom (&quot;Cortes&quot; in Portuguese) assembled in Coimbra and declared him King John I of Portugal. After his accession to the throne, John I of Portugal proceeded to annex the cities whose military commanders supported Princess Beatrice and her husband&#x27;s claims, namely Caminha, Braga, and Guimarães among others.

Enraged by this &quot;rebellion&quot;, Juan I ordered a host of 31,000 men to engage in a two-pronged invasion in May. The smaller Northern force sacked and burnt towns along the border, before being defeated by local Portuguese nobles in the battle of Trancoso, in the first week of June. On the news of the invasion by the Castilians, John I of Portugal&#x27;s army met with Nuno Álvares Pereira, the Constable of Portugal, in the town of Tomar. There they decided to face the Castilians before they could get close to Lisbon and lay siege to it again.

Mercenaries arrived from Gascony at Easter of 1385, sent to honor the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 (still the oldest active international treaty in the world). This company was composed of about 200 English longbowmen, veterans from the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and around 500 locally recruited men-at-arms mostly of English and Gascon background, though a Florentine volunteer was also mentioned. 

The Portuguese set out to intercept the invading army near the town of Leiria. Nuno Álvares Pereira took on the task of choosing the ground for the battle. Russell notes that the two Portuguese leaders (Nuno Álvares and Antão Vasques) had already shown themselves masters of the new developments in methods of warfare, i.e. the use of archers and dismounted men-at-arms. The chosen location was São Jorge near Aljubarrota, especially suitable for the chosen military tactic, being a small flattened hill surrounded by creeks, with the very small settlement of Chão da Feira at its widest point, still present today. 

By having his army on the road to Lisbon, John de Avis effectively lured John of Castile&#x27;s attention from laying siege at the capital itself and morally forced him to offer battle there, on his own terms. As in the Battle of Agincourt, winning this pitched battle would mean a decisive victory for Avis&#x27; cause, even with smaller numbers and resources.

==Portuguese dispositions==
At around 10 o&#x27;clock in the morning of the 14th of August, the army of John I took its position at the north side of this hill, facing the road where the Castilians would soon appear. As in other defensive battles of the 14th century (Bannockburn (1314), Crécy (1346) or Poitiers (1356), for example), the dispositions were as following: dismounted cavalry and infantry in the centre with archers occupying the flanks. Notably, on the vanguard&#x27;s left wing (later covering the left flank), a company composed by some two hundred unmarried young nobles is remembered to history as the &quot;Ala dos Namorados&quot; (Lovers&#x27; Flank); the right wing, also two hundred strong, known as &quot;Ala de Madressilva&quot; or Honeysuckle Flank, didn&#x27;t achieve the same heroic fame. On either side, the army was protected by natural obstacles (in this case, creeks and steep slopes). In the rear, reinforcements were at hand, commanded by John I of Portugal himself. In this topographically high position, the Portuguese could observe the enemy&#x27;s arrival and were protected by a steep slope in their front. The rear of the Portuguese position, which was in fact its front in the final battle, was at the top of a narrow slope, which came up to a small village, and was further defended by a complex series of interlocking trenches and caltrops designed to surprise and trap the enemy cavalry. This trenching tactic was developed around this time and used extensively by both the English in France and the Portuguese in the rare set-piece battles of the Crisis of the Succession.

Contrary to previous popular belief that Portuguese men-at-arms on John de Avis&#x27; side were badly equipped, and that his foot soldiers were almost with no armor, there&#x27;s no reason to believe the Portuguese knightly class, even the ones that remained at Master de Avis&#x27; side — as most of the upper nobility supported John of Castile, were not able to afford the knightly harness expected in the same Iberian standards of its time. And while the Portuguese primary sources use the comparative inferiority of Portuguese equipment to increase the glory of their victory, this should be considered by the light that most of the action made by John of Castile&#x27;s side was enjoyed by heavily armored men-at-arms, and by jinete light cavalry armed with at least a combination of mail and padded armor.

Frei Pedro, in his sermon given at Lisbon after the battle, describes the Portuguese equipment: &quot;The Portuguese [...] were poorly and badly armed; here, the one that had mail armor didn&#x27;t have padded armor, and the one that had a cuirass didn&#x27;t have arm harness, and many of them with open-faced bascinets. So that if all their arms were matched as they should, it won&#x27;t equip a third of the people&quot;. While this equipment would be inferior to the standards expected from a man-at-arms, it would otherwise be well adequate for actual infantry, which composed most of Lisbon&#x27;s host. Other sources mention Portuguese arms as: &quot;everyone&#x27;s defensive arms were bascinets with camail, either open-faced or with visor, and coats of plates, padded armor, mail shirts, mail skirts and cuirasses; and for offensive spears and pollaxes of iron and lead, and axes for those who could have them&quot;.

==Castile arrives==

The Castilian vanguard arrived from the north around midday. Seeing the strongly defensive position occupied by the Portuguese, John of Castile decided to avoid combat on John of Portugal&#x27;s terms. Slowly, due to the numbers of his army (about 31,000 men), the Castilian army started to contour the hill where the Portuguese were. John of Castile&#x27;s scouts had noticed that the South side of the hill had a gentler slope and it was there that the Castilian king wanted to attack.

In response to this movement, the Portuguese army inverted its dispositions and headed to the South slope of the hill. Since they were fewer than the enemy and had less ground to cover, they attained their final position very early in the afternoon. To calm the soldiers&#x27; nervousness and to improve his army&#x27;s defensive position, general Nuno Álvares Pereira ordered the construction of a system of ditches, pits and caltrops. This application of typical English tactical procedures had also been used by the Portuguese in the previous battle of Atoleiros and was especially effective against cavalry (the speciality of both the Castilian and the French armies).

Around six o&#x27;clock in the afternoon the Castilian army was ready for battle. According to John of Castile, in his report of the battle, his soldiers were by then very tired from the march that had started early in the morning under a blazing August sun. There was no time to halt then, and the battle would soon begin.

==Battle==
The initiative of starting the battle was with the Castilian side. The French allied heavy cavalry charged in full strength, in order to disrupt order in the enemy lines. According to Jean Froissart, based on ocular testimonies of the battle: &quot;The French knights amounted to two thousand, as gallant lances as could be seen. The moment they perceived the enemy they formed in close order, like men of resolution who knew their business, and advanced within bow-shot&quot;. 

As was customary in many wars the French cavalry participated during this period, their impulsive advance proved catastrophic, as they were too far from the rest of the Castilian army to get any support, and were met uphill with obstacles, a narrow passage and a shower of arrows and crossbow bolts, which killed many horses, injured some men, and caused confusion. The French, however, being heavily armored, still made it into the vanguard, where heavy fighting was issued with the Portuguese and Anglo-Gascon men-at-arms. The losses of the cavalry were heavy and the effect of its attack completely null. Support from the Castilian rear was late to come and the knights that did not perish in the combat were made prisoners and sent to the Portuguese rear.

Froissart claims envy was the reason behind why the Spaniards were undisposed to help the French, held to be the best heavy cavalry of Europe, and highly prized by the King of Castile himself:

&quot;&quot;It is also true, that the battle began too soon; but they did so to acquire greater honour, and to make their words good which they had said in the presence of the king. On the other hand, as I have heard, the Castilians made no great haste to advance, for the French were not in good favour with them, and they had said, &quot;Let them begin the fight, and tire themselves: they will find enough to do. These Frenchmen are too great boasters, and too vainglorious, and our king has not any perfect confidence but in them. Since he wishes that they should have the honour of the day, it shall be so; for we will have it our own way, or not at all.&quot; Conformably to this resolution, the Spaniards kept in a large body, twenty thousand at least, in the plain, and would not advance, which vexed the king much; but he could not help it, for they said, &quot;My lord, it is all over, (though none had returned from the battle): these French knights have defeated your enemies: the honour and victory of the day are theirs.&quot;&quot;.

As few of the Frenchmen managed to escape, most were either slain or taken prisoner. When the main Castilian force entered the battle, they caused a great impression due to their order, equipment, and numbers. In order to get to the Portuguese line, however, the Castilians became disorganized, squeezing into the space between the two creeks that protected the flanks. At this time, the Portuguese reorganized. The vanguard of Nuno Álvares Pereira divided into two sectors. John of Portugal ordered the archers and crossbowmen to retire, while his rear troops advanced through the space opened between the vanguards. With all his troops needed at the front, there were no men available to guard the knight prisoners; John of Portugal ordered them to be killed on the spot and proceeded to deal with the approaching Castilians.. According to Froissart, however, Avis&#x27; war council decided to slay their prisoners before the main body of Castile arrived, after the French cavalry failure, killing many knights, esquires and non-noble men-at-arms.

Advancing uphill with the sun on their backs, squashed between the funnelling Portuguese defensive works and their own advancing rear, and under a heavy rain of English longbowmen&#x27;s arrows shot from behind the Portuguese line and crossbow quarrels from behind both the Sweethearts&#x27; and the Honeysuckle wings on their flanks, the Castilians fought to win the day. The Castilian knights in the main body were forced to dismount and break in half their four-metre-long lances in order to join the constricted melèe alongside their infantry.

At this stage of the battle, both sides sustained heavy losses, especially on the &quot;Ala dos Namorados&quot; where the Portuguese students became renowned for holding off the heavily armoured knights of the Castilian wings who, still on horseback, attempted to flank the Portuguese lines. A similar attack was more successful on the right &quot;Honeysuckle&quot; flank, though only briefly and late in the fight.

By sunset, only one hour after the battle began, the Castilian position was indefensible. When the Castilian royal standard-bearer fell, the already demoralized troops in the rear thought their King was dead and started to flee in panic; in a matter of moments this became a general rout where Juan of Castile had to run at full speed to save his life, leaving behind not only common soldiers but also many still dismounted noblemen.

The Portuguese pursued them down the hill and, with the battle won, killed many more while there was still light enough to see the enemy. 

King John de Avis, described as tall and strong, made a great impression during the battle, first mounted in a stallion covered in horse caparison with the arms of Portugal, but later described during the melee at the pass, giving hard strokes with his pollaxe and &quot;knocking down three or four of the stoutest of the enemy, insomuch that none dared to approach him&quot;. The poleaxe, which seems to have been his favorite weapon, substituted the honoured place of the longsword during his funeral procession.

==Aftermath==

During the night and throughout the next day, as many as 5000 more Castilians were killed by the neighbouring inhabitants; according to Portuguese tradition surrounding the battle, there was a woman called Brites de Almeida, the &quot;Padeira de Aljubarrota&quot; (the baker-woman of Aljubarrota), said to be very tall and strong, and to possess six fingers on each hand, who by herself killed seven Castilian soldiers as they were hiding in her bakery in the town of Aljubarrota after the battle. This story is clouded in legend and hearsay, but the popular intervention in the massacre of Castilian troops after the battle is, nevertheless, historical and typical of battles in this period, when there was no mercy toward the defeated enemy.

On the morning of the following day, the true dimension of the battle was revealed. In the field, the bodies of Castilians were enough to dam the creeks surrounding the small hill. In face of this, the Portuguese King offered the enemy survivors an amnesty and free transit home. Leading figures of the Castilian nobility perished that day, as well as complete army units (such as that of the Castilian city of Soria). An official period of mourning was decreed in Castile that would last until the Christmas of 1387.

In October 1385, Nuno Álvares Pereira led a pre-emptive attack against Mérida, in Castilian territory, defeating an even larger Castilian army than at Aljubarrota in the battle of Valverde, in Valverde de Mérida.
Scattered border skirmishes with Castilian troops would persist for five years more until the death of John I of Castile in 1390, but posed no real threat to the Portuguese crown; recognition from Castile would arrive only in 1411 with the signing of the Treaty of Ayllón (Segovia).

This victory of Aljubarrota confirmed John of Aviz as the uncontested King of Portugal and the House of Aviz ascended to the crown of Portugal. In 1386, the closeness of relations between Portugal and England resulted in a permanent military alliance with the Treaty of Windsor, the oldest still active in existence.

John&#x27;s marriage to Philippa of Lancaster in 1387 initiated the Portuguese second dynasty, and their children went on to make historically significant contributions. Duarte, or Edward of Portugal, became the eleventh King of Portugal known as &quot;The Philosopher&quot; and &quot;The Eloquent&quot;, and his brother Prince Henrique, or Henry the Navigator, sponsored expeditions to Africa.

To celebrate his victory and acknowledge divine help, John I of Portugal ordered the construction of the monastery of &quot;Santa Maria da Vitória na Batalha&quot; and the founding of the town of Batalha close to the site where the battle was fought. The monastery represents one of the best original examples of Late Gothic architecture in Portugal, intermingled with the Manueline style. The king, his wife Philippa of Lancaster, and several of his sons are buried in this monastery. 

In 1393, a chapel in honor of St. Mary and St. George was erected in the place where the standard of D. Nuno Álvares Pereira had been during the confrontation, allowing us to know the precise geographic location of the battle site.

In 1958, archeologist Afonso do Paço organized the first campaign of excavations, revealing the complex defensive system consisting of about 800 pits and dozens of defensive ditches and revealing one of the best preserved battlefields of the period of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

In March 2002, under the initiative of António Champalimaud, the Battle of Aljubarrota Foundation was created. The first of its activities was to recover the battlefield of Aljubarrota. Through a protocol established by the Ministry of Defense in August 2003, the Foundation received authorization to transform the Military Museum into a modern Interpretation Center of the Battle of Aljubarrota. This Interpretation Center was inaugurated on October 11, 2008.

On December 28, 2010, the Portuguese Official Journal published the Decret-Law n.º 18/2010, which states the legal recognition of the battlefield of Aljubarrota with the category of &quot;National Monument&quot;.
