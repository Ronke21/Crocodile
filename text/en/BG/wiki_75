<text>The Bristol Type 167 Brabazon was a large British piston-engined propeller-driven airliner designed by the Bristol Aeroplane Company to fly transatlantic routes between the UK and the United States. The type was named &quot;Brabazon&quot; after the Brabazon Committee and its chairman, Lord Brabazon of Tara, which had developed the specification to which the airliner was designed.

While Bristol had studied the prospects of developing very large aircraft as bombers prior to and during the Second World War, it was the release of a report compiled by the Brabazon Committee which led the company to adapt its proposed bomber into a large civil airliner to meet the &quot;Type I&quot; specification for the long-distance transatlantic route. Initially designated the Type 167, the proposed aircraft had a -diameter fuselage, containing full upper and lower decks on which passengers would be seated in luxurious conditions. It was powered by an arrangement of eight Bristol Centaurus radial engines which drove eight paired contra-rotating propellers set on four forward-facing nacelles.

Bristol decided to submit the Type 167 proposal to meet Air Ministry Specification 2/44. Following a brief evaluation period, a contract to build a pair of prototypes was awarded. At the time of its construction, the Brabazon was one of the largest aeroplanes ever built, being sized roughly between the much later Airbus A300 and Boeing 767 airliners. Despite its vast size, the Brabazon was designed to carry only 100 passengers, each one allowed an area about the size of the interior of a small car. On 4 September 1949 the first prototype made its maiden flight. In addition to participating in a flight test programme in support of the intended production aircraft, the prototype made high-profile public appearances at the 1950 Farnborough Airshow, Heathrow Airport, and the 1951 Paris Air Show.

However, due to the high cost per seat mile compared to the alternatives, the Brabazon did not attract any firm orders, so the aircraft was a commercial failure. On 17 July 1953 Duncan Sandys, the Minister of Supply, announced that the Brabazon had been cancelled due to a lack of military or civil orders. In the end, only the single prototype was flown, and it was broken up in 1953 for scrap, along with the incomplete, turboprop-powered Brabazon I Mk.II.

==Design and development==
===Background===

During the Second World War, the British government made the decision to dedicate its aircraft industry to the production of combat aircraft and to source the majority of its transport aircraft from manufacturers in the United States. Having foreseen that the effective abandonment of any development in terms of civil aviation would put Britain&#x27;s aviation industry at a substantial disadvantage once the conflict had come to an end, during 1943 a British government committee began meeting under the leadership of Lord Brabazon of Tara with the aim of investigating and forecasting the post-war civil aviation requirements of Britain and the Commonwealth of Nations.

The committee, which had become known simply as the Brabazon Committee, delivered its report, which was likewise known as the &quot;Brabazon Report&quot;. The report called for the construction of a total of four of five designs they had studied. Of those designs, the &quot;Type I&quot; was a very large transatlantic airliner, the &quot;Type II&quot; was a short-haul airliner, the &quot;Type III&quot; was a medium-range airliner for the multiple-hop &quot;Empire&quot; air routes, and the &quot;Type IV&quot; was an innovative jet-powered 500 mph (800 km/h) airliner. In particular, the Type I and Type IV were regarded as being of very high importance to the industry, particularly the jet-powered Type IV, which would give Britain a commanding lead in the field of jet transport. An outline of the specifications for the various envisioned aircraft, including the gigantic Type I, was issued by the Committee.

As early as 1937, the Bristol Aeroplane Company had conducted studies into very large bomber designs, one of which received the internal company designation of &quot;Type 159&quot;, and another, undesignated design that broadly resembled the eventual configuration of the Brabazon. Additionally, Bristol&#x27;s design team had already been considering the requirements of an aircraft capable of conducting routine transatlantic flights, which had led to projections of the necessary size, weight and range of such an airliner. Amongst those, it was determined that, in order to be profitable, a minimum payload of 100 passengers should be carried by the type.

In 1942, the Air Ministry issued a draft operational requirement from the Air Staff, which sought a heavy bomber design that would be capable of carrying a payload of at least 15 tons of bombs. In response, Bristol dusted off their original work and updated it to incorporate their newer and substantially more powerful Bristol Centaurus engines. The Bristol design team, led by L. G. Frise and Archibald Russell, worked with several key performance parameters. Those included a range of 5,000 mi (8,000 km), 225 ft (69 m) wingspan, eight engines buried in the wings driving four pusher propeller installations, and enough fuel for transatlantic range. The Convair B-36 was in many ways the American equivalent of that projected &quot;100-ton bomber&quot;. In addition to Bristol, many leading British manufacturers had provided several preliminary studies in response to the Air Ministry&#x27;s operational requirement. However, in expectation of long development times, and the difficulties associated with balancing the aircraft&#x27;s range, load and defensive armament, the Ministry never took up any of the British manufacturer&#x27;s designs. Instead, it was decided to continue development of the existing Avro Lancaster, which led to the production of the improved Avro Lincoln.

In 1942, the Brabazon Report was published and Bristol chose to respond, submitting a slightly modified version of their bomber to fulfil the Type I requirement. Bristol&#x27;s earlier work had demonstrated the sort of performance that the Brabazon Committee had been looking for, and so the Committee authorised the firm to begin preliminary design of such an aircraft that year, with the proviso that work on wartime aircraft should not be disrupted by the project. Bristol was soon issued with a contract to produce a pair of prototype aircraft.

===Bristol 167===
In November 1944, after further work on the design, a final concept for the Type 167 was published. The final design featured a large 177 ft (54 m) fuselage, paired with a sizable wing. The wing, which had a 230 ft (70.1 m) wingspan, possessed an enormous internal volume, to house sufficient fuel for the transatlantic flights envisioned for the type. It was powered by eight Bristol Centaurus 18-cylinder radial engines, which were the most powerful British-built piston engines available at the time, each being capable of generating . These were set in pairs in the wing, and instead of using a common crankshaft, the paired engines each had their driveshafts angled towards an enormous central gearbox. They drove a series of eight paired contra-rotating propellers, which were set on four forward-facing nacelles.

The Brabazon Report had assumed that the wealthy people flying in the aircraft would consider a long trip by air to be uncomfortable, and so designed the Type I for luxury, demanding 200 ft3 (6 m3) of space for every passenger, which was expanded to 270 ft3 (8 m3) for luxury class. If outfitted with conventionally spaced seating, the dimensions of the Type 167 could have accommodated up to 300 passengers, instead of the 60 seats opted for. Other high-comfort measures were proposed, such as an onboard cinema, a cocktail bar, and lounge area. According to author Stephan Wilkinson, the decision to focus on comfort over other qualities such as speed and payload had been a historic preoccupation of Britain operators to specifically tailor their services towards wealthy travellers, and noted that as having been a key pre-war ethos of the British airline Imperial Airways. Meanwhile, some figures within the aircraft industry were forecasting heavy demand from passengers then relying on ocean liners.

To meet these varied requirements, the Type 167 specified a huge -diameter fuselage, which was about 5 ft (1.5 m) greater than the 1970 Boeing 747 &quot;jumbo jet&quot;, with full-length upper and lower decks. That enclosed sleeping berths for 80 passengers, a dining room, 37-seat cinema, promenade and bar or, alternatively, day seats for 150 people. At one point, the Committee recommended the adoption of a narrower fuselage to house a total of 50 passengers. The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) agreed with that recommendation, and also expressed its preference for a design accommodating only 25 passengers. In August 1943, an agreement with the airline led to the selection of an interior layout which contained a forward area housing six compartments, each one for six passengers, along with a seventh compartment for just three passengers, a midsection above the wing – the wing was deep at that point – which accommodated 38 seats arranged around tables in groups of four along with a pantry and galley, and a rear area with 23 seats in an aft-facing cinema, complete with a cocktail bar and lounge. Similar to the Saunders-Roe Princess, the Brabazon concept was a fusion of prewar and postwar thinking, using highly advanced design and engineering to build an aircraft that was no longer relevant in the postwar world.

The Brabazon was the first aircraft to be outfitted with 100 per cent powered flying controls; it was also the first with electric engine controls, and the first equipped with high-pressure hydraulics. The large span and mounting of the engines close inboard, together with structural weight economies, demanded some new measure to prevent bending of wing surfaces in turbulence. One of the innovative features of the Brabazon was a purpose-developed gust-alleviation system, which used an assortment of servos that were triggered from a gust-sensing probe installed on the exterior of the aircraft&#x27;s nose; an improved version of this system, along with fully automated trimming, was to have been deployed on the Brabazon Mark II. Hydraulic power units were also designed to operate the aircraft&#x27;s giant control surfaces.

A tremendous effort was put into saving weight across the aircraft. The Type 167 used a number of non-standard gauges of skinning in order to tailor every panel to the strength required, thereby saving several tons of metal. Bristol employed revolutionary new machining and construction methods for drilling, milling, folding, and rolling many of the airframe&#x27;s components. Rivets were sealed in aircraft dope to greatly reduce the number required for airframe assembly. Significant emphasis had been placed upon simplifying the construction process and incorporating several manufacturing efficiencies. Some of the design and construction work for the aircraft was shared out to other British companies, such as Folland Aircraft.

Manufacturing the Brabazon was found to be a challenge. During the first two years of the development, the question of how and where to manufacture the aircraft was amongst the biggest issues that had preoccupied the design team and delayed progress on the project. Bristol&#x27;s existing factory at Bristol Filton Airport proved to be too small to handle what was one of the largest aircraft in the world, let alone producing the type in quantity, while the adjacent 2,000 ft (610 m) runway was too short for it to take off from. While considerations were made for developing the firm&#x27;s Banwell facility, it was eventually decided to expand the main Filton site to suit the Brabazon. Work on the project was slowed as Bristol&#x27;s wartime commitments had to be met. Amongst the early physical steps was the construction of a full-scale wooden mockup in the old No. 2 Flight Shed so that components and fittings could be applied and tested.
In October 1945, construction of the first prototype&#x27;s fuselage commenced in an existing hangar while a gigantic hall for performing final assembly of up to eight Brabazons was constructed; at the time of construction, the hall was the largest hangar in the world. the designer of the new assembly hall, T. P. O&#x27;Sullivan, was subsequently awarded the Telford Premium for the work. The runway was lengthened to 8,000 ft (2,440 m) and widened; this extension had necessitated the controversial compulsory relocation of the inhabitants of the village of Charlton to neighbouring Patchway.

===Mark II===
During the early 1940s, the only means for providing propulsion to large aircraft was to produce increasingly complex and enlarged radial engines. The emergence of jet propulsion, specifically the turboprop engine, happened to coincide with the Brabazon&#x27;s development. Accordingly, there was considerable interest in applying such an engine to the airliner as it potentially offered a simpler and more powerful alternative to the original Centaurus powerplant. Other advantages of turboprops included lower vibration levels, which would increase passenger comfort, and better performance at higher altitudes.

In 1946, it was decided to build the second prototype using eight paired Bristol Coupled Proteus turboprop engines driving four-bladed propellers through a common gearbox. This would have increased the Brabazon&#x27;s cruising speed, from 260 to 330 mph (420–530 km/h), and its ceiling, while reducing the aircraft&#x27;s empty weight by about 10,000 lb (4,540 kg). This Brabazon Mark II would have been able to cross the Atlantic from London to New York in a reduced time of 12 hours. However, by 1950, development of the Proteus engine had run into substantial difficulties, being both overweight and underpowered, and being subject to fatigue issues at one stage. Although the Proteus was slimmer than the Centaurus, the wing thickness was not to be reduced in the Mark II, but the leading edge would be extended around the engines.

Other planned changes for the Brabazon Mark II included a revised wheel arrangement which would have enabled the type to use the majority of runways on both the North Atlantic and Empire routes.

===Testing===
In December 1945, Bristol Chief Test Pilot Bill Pegg was selected to be the chief pilot for the Brabazon. In preparation for the impending flight testing, as a means of gaining experience in operating such a vast aircraft, Pegg accepted an invitation issued by Convair to travel to Fort Worth, Texas, to fly their B-36 Peacemaker, a large strategic bomber operated by the United States Air Force.

During December 1948, the Mk.I prototype, registration &quot;G-AGPW&quot;, was rolled out for engine runs. On 3 September 1949, the prototype, piloted by Pegg and co-piloted by Walter Gibb, along with a crew of eight observers and flight engineers, performed a series of trial taxi runs; these revealed no problems save for the nosewheel steering not working correctly; it was temporarily disabled. On 4 September 1949, the prototype performed its maiden flight over the Bristol area, flying for 25 minutes, captained by Pegg. Around 10,000 people had gathered at the airfield&#x27;s perimeter to witness takeoff. During this flight, it ascended to about 3,000 ft (910 m) at 160 mph (257 km/h) and landed at 115 mph (185 km/h), throttling back at 50 ft (15 m). The British press mainly reported favourably, one newspaper praising the aircraft as being &quot;the queen of the skies, the largest land-plane ever built&quot;.

Four days later, the prototype was presented at Society of British Aircraft Constructors&#x27; Airshow at Farnborough; according to author Philip Kaplan, the timing of the first flight had been chosen to enable this high-profile early appearance. The Brabazon&#x27;s appearance at Farnborough led to the adoption of a formal and deliberate company policy to carry out much of the aircraft&#x27;s test programme in the vicinity of various British cities to spread public awareness. Accordingly, the Brabazon was demonstrated at the 1950 Farnborough Airshow, at which it performed a takeoff, clean configuration flypast and a landing. In June 1950, the Brabazon made a visit to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport, during which it made a number of successful takeoffs and landings; it was also demonstrated at the 1951 Paris Air Show. Gibb, who flew the aircraft as pilot-in-command on multiple flights, summarised his flying experiences with the type: &quot;It was very comfortable. It flew very well. It was big. You didn&#x27;t whip it around like a Tiger Moth or Spitfire, but as long as you treated it like a double-decker bus or a large aeroplane, you had no trouble at all&quot;.

While the Brabazon&#x27;s flight tests were being performed, BOAC became increasingly uninterested with the prospects for operating the type. On a test flight, BOAC chairman Sir Miles Thomas briefly took the controls and found the aircraft to be underpowered and very slow to respond to the controls. BOAC quickly decided it was not for them. Bristol had been subject to financial hardship, while development of the Proteus engine intended to power the envisioned and improved Brabazon Mark II was proving troublesome. Flight tests of the aircraft itself had revealed some fatigue issues in the inner wingbox area, while the projected operating costs for the Brabazon had been revised upwards as the programme had proceeded. BOAC, being unconvinced of the aircraft&#x27;s merits, ultimately chose not to place any order for the type. Gibb stated of the situation: &quot;the spec wasn&#x27;t correct for post-war flying. The people who wrote the specs... conceived of an aeroplane with all this comfort, bunks, and a great dining room to eat in. And, of course, come the day, that wasn&#x27;t what the airlines wanted. They wanted to ram as many passengers as possible into the tube and give &#x27;em lunch on their laps.&quot;

At one point, although some interest was shown by British European Airways (BEA) for conducting operational flights using the prototype Brabazon itself, various problems that would typically be expected to be present on a prototype meant the aircraft would never receive an airworthiness certificate.

===Cancellation===
By 1952, about £3.4 million had been spent on development and there were no signs of purchase by any airline. In March, the British government announced that work on the second prototype had been postponed. The cancellation of the project was announced by the Minister of Supply (Duncan Sandys) on 17 July 1953 in the Commons, saying the programme had given all the useful technical knowledge it could but without any firm interest from either civil or military users, there was no justification for continuing to spend money on the Brabazon. By this point, roughly £6 million had been spent on the programme and a further £2 million would have been required in order to complete the Mark II. In October 1953, after 164 flights totalling 382 hours&#x27; flying time, the first prototype was broken up and sold for £10,000 in scrap value, along with the uncompleted Mk.II prototype. All that remains are a few parts at the M Shed museum in Bristol and the National Museum of Flight in Scotland.

Although considered a failure and a white elephant, the record of the Brabazon is not entirely unfavourable. At least half of the large sums spent on the project had been expended upon the construction of infrastructure, including £6 million for new large hangars and an extended runway at Filton. These improvements meant that Bristol was in an excellent position to continue production of other designs; the assembly hall was soon being used for building another transatlantic aircraft, the Britannia. The same assembly hall was later used in construction of the Concorde. In addition, many of the techniques which had been developed during the Brabazon project were applicable to any aircraft, not just airliners.

Bristol had also been awarded the contract for the Type III aircraft, for which they delivered the Britannia. By making use of the advances made during the development of the Brabazon, Bristol were able to design the Britannia to possess the best payload fraction of any aircraft up to that time, and it held that record for a number of years. Although the Britannia was delayed after problems with the separate Type IV, the jet-powered de Havilland Comet, it went on to be a workhorse for many airlines into the 1970s.

<doc id="318647" wikidata="Q5589370" url="?curid=318647" title="Government of the 26th Dáil">
<text>There were two governments of the 26th Dáil elected at the 1989 general election on 15 June 1989, both being coalition governments of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The 21st government of Ireland (12 July 1989 – 11 February 1992) was led by Charles Haughey as Taoiseach and lasted . The 22nd government of Ireland (11 February 1992 – 12 January 1993) was led by Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach and lasted from its appointment until resignation, and continued to carry out its duties for a further 29 days until the appointment of its successor, giving a total of .

==21st government of Ireland==
===Nomination of Taoiseach===
The 26th Dáil first met on 26 June 1989. In the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil leader and outgoing Taoiseach Charles Haughey, Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, and Labour Party leader Dick Spring were each proposed. Each of these proposals were lost: Haughey received 78 votes with 86 votes against, Dukes received 61 votes with 103 votes against, and Spring received 24 votes with 138 votes against. Haughey resigned as Taoiseach, continuing to serve in a caretaker capacity.

The Dáil met again on 3 July and on 6 July, but no vote was taken on the nomination of the Taoiseach. On 12 July, Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats had agreed to form a coalition government, the 21st government of Ireland (12 July 1989 – 11 February 1992). The same three leaders were proposed again for the nomination of the Dáil for appointment by the president to be Taoiseach. On this occasion, the nomination of Haughey was carried by the Dáil with 84 votes in favour and 79 against.

===Government ministers===
After his appointment as Taoiseach by the president, Haughey proposed the members of the government on 12 July and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.
;Change to Departments
===Attorney General===
On 12 July 1989 John L. Murray SC was re-appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach. Murray resigned on 25 September 1991, and Harry Whelehan SC was appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach.

===Ministers of state===
On 12 July 1989, Vincent Brady was appointed by the government on the nomination of the Taoiseach to the post of Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip. On 19 July 1989, the government appointed the other Ministers of State on the nomination of the Taoiseach.

===Presidential election===
From January to June 1990 Ireland held the presidency of the European Community. The 1990 Presidential election was held on 7 November. Mary Robinson won the election, defeating the Fianna Fáil candidate Brian Lenihan and the Fine Gael candidate Austin Currie. During the campaign, Lenihan was obliged to correct the record on whether he had contacted president Patrick Hillery in January 1982 to advise against the dissolution of the Dáil. Alan Dukes proposed a motion of no confidence in the government. This was debated as a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and the government, proposed by Taoiseach Charles Haughey. It was approved by a vote of 83 to 80.

===Challenge to leadership and aftermath===
In October 1991, the Dáil debated a motion of confidence in the government. On 18 October, confidence in the government was approved by a vote of 84 to 81.

On 6 November 1991, Seán Power proposed a motion of no confidence in Haughey as leader of Fianna Fáil. Albert Reynolds and Pádraig Flynn, who supported the motion, were sacked from government. On 10 November, the motion was defeated.

In the reshuffle that followed, Jim McDaid was proposed as Minister for Defence on 13 November 1991, but his name was withdrawn later that day.

===Resignation===
In early 1992 Seán Doherty, who as Minister for Justice had taken the blame for the phone-tapping scandal of the early 1980s, claimed on RTÉ that Haughey had known and authorised it. Haughey denied this but the Progressive Democrats stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach.

On 30 January 1992, Haughey resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil. Following a leadership election, he was succeeded by Albert Reynolds who formed the 22nd government of Ireland.

==22nd government of Ireland==

Charles Haughey resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil on 30 January, and Albert Reynolds won the party leadership election on 6 February. The 22nd government of Ireland (11 February 1992 – 12 January 1993) was formed by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties with Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach.

===Nomination of Taoiseach===
On 11 February, Albert Reynolds and John Bruton were proposed for the nomination of the Dáil for appointment by the president to be Taoiseach. The nomination of Reynolds was carried and he was appointed by the president.

===Government ministers===
After his appointment as Taoiseach by the president, Albert Reynolds proposed the members of the government and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.

Reynolds did not re-appoint Ray Burke, Mary O&#x27;Rourke and Gerry Collins, while promoting critics of Haughey like David Andrews, Séamus Brennan, and Charlie McCreevy into senior ministerial positions. Reynolds also promoted a number of younger TDs from rural constituencies like Noel Dempsey and Brian Cowen, to cabinet position. Bertie Ahern remained as Minister for Finance.

===Attorney General===
On 12 January 1993 Harry Whelehan SC was appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach.

===Ministers of state===
On 11 February 1992, the government on the nomination of the Taoiseach appointed Noel Dempsey, TD to the post of Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip, and Mary Harney as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with special responsibility for the office for the Protection of the Environment. On 13 February 1992, the government on the nomination of the Taoiseach appointed the other Ministers of State.

===Constitutional referendums===
The Eleventh Amendment was approved in a referendum held on 18 June 1992, allowing the state to ratify the Maastricht Treaty.

In March 1992, the Supreme Court held in the X Case that there was a right to access abortion in Ireland where there was a risk to the mother&#x27;s life, including from a risk of suicide. The government responded with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1992, which would have amended the Constitution to prevent a risk of suicide as a ground for an abortion. This proposal was rejected in a referendum. The Thirteenth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment were approved, providing respectively that the right to life of the unborn did not limit freedom to travel or to obtain information about services available outside the jurisdiction of the state. These three referendums were held on 25 November 1992, the date of the general election following the dissolution of the 26th Dáil.

===Confidence in the government===
A tribunal of inquiry into irregularities in the beef industry, referred to as the Beef Tribunal, was established to examine the relationship between successive Irish governments and the beef industry. Evidence at the tribunal revealed a substantial conflict of opinion between the two government party leaders. At the tribunal Desmond O&#x27;Malley severely criticised Reynolds, in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, for an export credit scheme. When Reynolds gave evidence he referred to O&#x27;Malley as &quot;dishonest&quot;, the Progressive Democrats left the government on 4 November 1992. On 5 November 1992, Reynolds proposed a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and the government.

Following the defeat of the motion of confidence, Reynolds sought a dissolution of the Dáil, which was granted by the Presidential Commission, and the 1992 general election was held on 25 November.

===Resignation and succession===
The 27th Dáil first met on 14 December 1992. The Dáil did not successfully nominate anyone for the position of Taoiseach on that day, with Albert Reynolds, John Bruton and Dick Spring being defeated. Reynolds resigned as Taoiseach but under the provisions of Article 28.11 of the Constitution, the members of the government continued to carry out their duties until their successors were appointed. The 23rd government of Ireland was formed on 12 January 1993 as a coalition between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, with Albert Reynolds again serving as Taoiseach.

<text>The musica universalis (literally universal music), also called music of the spheres or harmony of the spheres, is a philosophical concept that regards proportions in the movements of celestial bodies—the Sun, Moon, and planets—as a form of music. The theory, originating in ancient Greece, was a tenet of Pythagoreanism, and was later developed by 16th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler. Kepler did not believe this &quot;music&quot; to be audible, but felt that it could nevertheless be heard by the soul. The idea continued to appeal to scholars until the end of the Renaissance, influencing many schools of thought, including humanism.

== History ==


The concept of the &quot;music of the spheres&quot; incorporates the metaphysical principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or &quot;tones&quot; of energy that manifests in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds—all connected within a pattern of proportion. Pythagoras first identified that the pitch of a musical note is an inverse proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios. Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution, and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear. Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as &quot;twinned&quot; studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.

Aristotle characterized the theory as follows:

Aristotle rejected the idea, however, as incompatible with his own cosmological model, and on the grounds that &quot;excessive noises ... shatter the solid bodies even of inanimate things&quot;, and therefore any sounds made by the planets would necessarily exert a tremendous physical force upon the body.

Boethius, in his influential work &quot;De Musica&quot;, described three categories of music:

* &quot;musica mundana&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;musica universalis&quot;)
* &quot;musica humana&quot; (the internal music of the human body)
* &quot;musica quae in quibusdam constituta est instrumentis&quot; (sounds made by singers and instrumentalists)
Boethius believed that &quot;musica mundana&quot; could only be discovered through the intellect, but that the order found within it was the same as that found in audible music, and that both reflect the beauty of God.

== &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot; ==

&quot;Musica universalis&quot;—which had existed as a metaphysical concept since the time of the Greeks—was often taught in quadrivium, and this intriguing connection between music and astronomy stimulated the imagination of Johannes Kepler as he devoted much of his time after publishing the &quot;Mysterium&quot; &quot;Cosmographicum&quot; (Mystery of the Cosmos), looking over tables and trying to fit the data to what he believed to be the true nature of the cosmos as it relates to musical sound. In 1619, Kepler published &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot; (literally Harmonies of the World), expanding on the concepts he introduced in &quot;Mysterium&quot; and positing that musical intervals and harmonies describe the motions of the six known planets of the time. He believed that this harmony—while inaudible—could be heard by the soul, and that it gave a &quot;very agreeable feeling of bliss, afforded him by this music in the imitation of God.&quot; In &quot;Harmonices&quot;, Kepler—who took issue with Pythagorean observations—laid out an argument for a Christian-centric creator who had made an explicit connection between geometry, astronomy, and music, and that the planets were arranged intelligently.

&quot;Harmonices&quot; is split into five books, or chapters. The first and second books give a brief discussion on regular polyhedra and their congruences, reiterating the idea he introduced in &quot;Mysterium&quot; that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits of the planets and their distances from the sun. Book three focuses on defining musical harmonies, including consonance and dissonance, intervals (including the problems of just tuning), their relations to string length which was a discovery made by Pythagoras, and what makes music pleasurable to listen to in his opinion. In the fourth book, Kepler presents a metaphysical basis for this system, along with arguments as to why the harmony of the worlds appeals to the intellectual soul in the same manner that the harmony of music appeals to the human soul. Here, he also uses the naturalness of this harmony as an argument for heliocentrism. In book five, Kepler describes in detail the orbital motion of the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies. Finally, after a discussion on astrology in book five, Kepler ends &quot;Harmonices&quot; by describing his third law, which states that—for any planet—the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the square of its orbital period.

In the final book of &quot;Harmonices&quot;, Kepler explains how the ratio of the maximum and minimum angular speeds of each planet (i.e., its speeds at the perihelion and aphelion) is very nearly equivalent to a consonant musical interval. Furthermore, the ratios between these extreme speeds of the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies. These speeds explain the eccentricity of the orbits of the planets in a natural way that appealed to Kepler&#x27;s religious beliefs in a heavenly creator.

While Kepler did believe that the harmony of the worlds was inaudible, he related the motions of the planets to musical concepts in book four of &quot;Harmonices&quot;. He makes an analogy between comparing the extreme speeds of one planet and the extreme speeds of multiple planets with the difference between monophonic and polyphonic music. Because planets with larger eccentricities have a greater variation in speed they produce more &quot;notes.&quot; Earth&#x27;s maximum and minimum speeds, for example, are in a ratio of roughly 16 to 15, or that of a semitone, whereas Venus&#x27; orbit is nearly circular, and therefore only produces a singular note. Mercury, which has the largest eccentricity, has the largest interval, a minor tenth, or a ratio of 12 to 5. This range, as well as the relative speeds between the planets, led Kepler to conclude that the Solar System was composed of two basses (Saturn and Jupiter), a tenor (Mars), two altos (Venus and Earth), and a soprano (Mercury), which had sung in &quot;perfect concord,&quot; at the beginning of time, and could potentially arrange themselves to do so again. He was certain of the link between musical harmonies and the harmonies of the heavens and believed that &quot;man, the imitator of the Creator,&quot; had emulated the polyphony of the heavens so as to enjoy &quot;the continuous duration of the time of the world in a fraction of an hour.&quot;

Kepler was so convinced of a creator that he was convinced of the existence of this harmony despite a number of inaccuracies present in &quot;Harmonices&quot;. Many of the ratios differed by an error greater than simple measurement error from the true value for the interval, and the ratio between Mars&#x27; and Jupiter&#x27;s angular velocities does not create a consonant interval, though every other combination of planets does. Kepler brushed aside this problem by making the argument, with the math to support it, that because these elliptical paths had to fit into the regular solids described in &quot;Mysterium&quot; the values for both the dimensions of the solids and the angular speeds would have to differ from the ideal values to compensate. This change also had the benefit of helping Kepler retroactively explain why the regular solids encompassing each planet were slightly imperfect. Philosophers posited that the Creator liked variation in the celestial music.

Kepler&#x27;s books are well-represented in the Library of Sir Thomas Browne, who also expressed a belief in the music of the spheres:
For there is a musicke where-ever there is a harmony, order or proportion; and thus farre we may maintain the musick of the spheres; for those well ordered motions, and regular paces, though they give no sound unto the eare, yet to the understanding they strike a note most full of harmony. Whatsoever is harmonically composed, delights in harmony.

==Orbital resonance==

In celestial mechanics, orbital resonance occurs when orbiting bodies exert regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually because their orbital periods are related by a ratio of small integers. This has been referred to as a &quot;modern take&quot; on the theory of &quot;musica universalis&quot;. This idea has been further explored in a musical animation, created by an artist at the European Southern Observatory, of the planetary system TOI-178, which has five planets locked in a chain of orbital resonances.

==Cultural influence==
William Shakespeare makes reference to the music of the spheres in &quot;The Merchant of Venice:&quot;

In the 1910s, Danish composer Rued Langgaard composed a pioneering orchestral work titled &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;.

Paul Hindemith also made use of the concept in his 1957 opera, &quot;Die Harmonie der Welt&quot; (&quot;The Harmony of the World&quot;), based upon the life of Johannes Kepler.

A number of other modern compositions have been inspired by the concept of &quot;musica universalis&quot;. Among these are &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; by Neil Ardley, live-only track &quot;La musique des sphères&quot; by Magma/VanderTop, &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; by Mike Oldfield, &quot;The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi&quot; by The Receiving End of Sirens, &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; by Ian Brown, &quot;Cosmogony&quot; by Björk, and the Coldplay album &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;.

&quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; was also the title of a companion piece to the video game &quot;Destiny&quot;, composed by Martin O&#x27;Donnell, Michael Salvatori, and Paul McCartney.

A concert band arrangement by Philip Sparke has also used the name &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; and is often used as a set test piece, with a notable studio performance recorded by the YBS Band while led by maestro Professor David King.

Reference is made to the music of the spheres in the short story &quot;The Horror in the Museum&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft.

In the video game &quot;Overwatch&quot;, the playable character Sigma often claims the universe is singing to him.

During the 2008 BBC Proms Doctor Who segment, a short interactive mini-episode starring David Tennant and written by showrunner Russell T Davies titled &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; was played. This sees the Doctor attempting to compose &quot;Ode to the Universe&quot;, basing his works on the Music of the Spheres. This piece continues the metaphysical theories of the &quot;musica universalis&quot; by arguing that the audience themselves are part of the composition.

<doc id="318651" wikidata="Q6679961" url="?curid=318651" title="Lord Snooty">
<text>Lord Snooty is a fictional character who stars in the British comic strip &quot;Lord Snooty and his Pals&quot; from the British comic anthology &quot;The Beano&quot;. The strip debuted in issue 1, illustrated by DC Thomson artist Dudley D. Watkins, who designed and wrote Snooty&#x27;s stories until 1968, but the stories would continue featuring in &quot;Beano&quot; issues until 1991, with occasional revivals and character cameos.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Lord Snooty&quot; starred a wealthy Eton schoolboy named Marmaduke, the bored Earl of Bunkerton who often sneaked out of his home to bond with the working-class children on the other side of town. His friends knew he was a wealthy child and affectionately nicknamed him &quot;Snooty&quot;, but he donned a disguise to hide from his family and the Bunkerton Castle staff. Other stories followed misadventures in Snooty&#x27;s life, such as him outsmarting or helping the residents of the castle, causing or running into mayhem with his friends, visiting Professor Screwtop to help with his new invention, or rivalling the Gasworks Gang.

==Publication history==
===Original run===
&quot;Lord Snooty and His Pals&quot; first appeared in issue 1 of &quot;The Beano&quot;, debuting with the comic strips &quot;Wee Peem&quot;, &quot;Morgyn the Mighty&quot;, &quot;Wild Boy of the Woods&quot;, &quot;Here Comes Ping the Elastic Man&quot; and cover star Big Eggo. It was one of the notable few in the first issue inspired by the &quot;funny pages&quot; from American newspapers, whereas the rest of the magazine contained adventure stories written in prose. Dudley D. Watkins illustrated, an in-house DC Thomson artist known for creating stories for Oor Wullie and &quot;The Dandy&quot;″s Desperate Dan. The strip ended in issue 367, returning December 1950 in issue 440. Upon return, many of Snooty&#x27;s friends were replaced with characters from discontinued &quot;Beano&quot; strips. Watkins continued illustrating many stories throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but Leo Baxendale illustrated strips from issues 691 to 718. Robert Nixon became the new artist in 1968 from issue 1343, followed by Jimmy Glen from issue 1594, and Ken H. Harrison from issue 2379. Harrison&#x27;s last story would appear in 1991 in issue 2565, making Lord Snooty the last series from the first issue to feature in &quot;The Beano&quot;.

There were two hiatuses in the comic strip&#x27;s run: the first from August 1949 to December 1950, and the second between March 1958 and November 1959. The latter hiatus did not remove Snooty&#x27;s appearances entirely, helped by six-issued, Albert Holroyd-illustrated series &quot;A Funny Thing Happened the Other Day—&quot;described as &quot;a coda&quot; to the second series. Secretly, the hiatus was longer than advertised: &quot;Lord Snooty and His Pals&quot; reprints filled the third series run until 1964; some panels redrawn to replace Lord Snooty&#x27;s old pals with the crossover characters.

===Subsequent appearances===
Due to a loss of popularity, Lord Snooty&#x27;s stories petered away in 1991, but he would still cameo in other comic strips or feature in short revivals. A notable one was in 2001, in issue 3093&#x27;s &quot;Lord Snooty&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, which revealed Snooty and many popular comic strip stars of previous generations now lived in the Beano Retirement Home. He also guest-starred in the 65th anniversary issue alongside The Bash Street Kids, and starred in Kev F. Sutherland&#x27;s &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; in 2005 where he tries to become the newest hip-hop artist Snoot Doggy-Dogg. In the 2010s, Lord Snooty received more appearances and new stories, often authored and illustrated by Lew Stringer: a feature in the &quot;Funsize Funnies&quot;, and a revival series in 2014. For the 80th anniversary, he appeared in issue 3945 in a flashback with other characters from 1938. Snooty&#x27;s last appearance was a background cameo in 2021 in issue 4111.

Outside of the weekly comic, Snooty featured heavily through the franchise, with exclusive stories in The Beano Annual throughout the years—often coinciding with his comic strip runs, and appeared with Snitch and Snatch in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Bash Street Kids Book&quot;. He also appeared in the inner cover artwork of the 2019 Beano Annual with 254 other characters from The Beano&#x27;s history and was in the time-travelling comic feature &quot;Doctor Whoops!&quot; On 9 September 1998, a book entitled &quot;The Legend of Lord Snooty and his Pals&quot; was published, containing a history of the comic strip and reprints from the first 30 years of the strip&#x27;s life.

=== In other DC Thomson comics ===
Lord Snooty also featured throughout DC Thomson&#x27;s other comic magazines. Hoot featured short three frame strips involving the character drawn by George Martin. Reprints featured in &quot;Classics from the Comics&quot;, &quot;The Best of The Beezer&quot; and &quot;The Best of The Topper&quot;.

==Characters==
===Regular characters===
*Marmaduke &quot;Lord Snooty&quot;, Earl of Bunkerton – main character. The son of the Duke, according to the first issue&#x27;s tagline, who is uninterested in his responsibilities and wants to have a normal life like his working-class friends. He would wear a disguise (patchy dungarees, a flat cap and scuffed shoes) to hide from his family and the castle staff until story 6. Despite his uninterest in taking charge so young, stories are usually about Snooty using his connections to humble adults in authority who use rules to boss him or his friends around (e.g. the mayor, his staff, teachers, police).
*Aunt Matilda – Snooty&#x27;s strict guardian who means well, nicknamed Aunt Mat. She meets Snooty&#x27;s friends in story 5 believing they rescued him after he collapsed in a wooded area and allows them to visit him at Bunkerton Castle. Bunkerton staff&#x27;s appearances diminish throughout the stories so Matilda frequently relies on her nephew and his friends to help her with repairs, decorating and cleaning the castle.
*Samuel – the castle guard.

===Ash Can Alley kids===
First described as &quot;the Beezer kids of Ash-Can Alley&quot;, Snooty&#x27;s friends lived in Bunkerton Castle&#x27;s nearby working-class neighbourhood of Ash Can and attended Ash Can Council School. From 1938 to the story&#x27;s first hiatus, (excluding Snooty) there were six members, including a goat, and then identical toddlers joined the group later. When &quot;Lord Snooty and His Pals&quot; returned in 1950, the only remaining original members were the identical twins, Scrapper and Rosie, whilst the rest of Snooty&#x27;s friends would leave and be replaced by other characters who had already been established in their own &quot;Beano&quot; comic strips.

====Original friends====
*Skinny Lizzie – thin girl with a dark, messy bob hairstyle, who wears a bobble hat
*Hairpin Huggins – a skinny boy almost as tall as some of the adults.
*&quot;Happy&quot; Hutton – a boy with light-coloured hair (later revealed in coloured &quot;Beano&quot; issues) whose resting face looks tired, wrinkled and sulky. Seemingly nicknamed &quot;happy&quot; for irony, Hutton has often been shown in panels smiling or laughing with the rest of his friends.
*Gertie the Goat – a goat the children use for transport or as an honorary human who helps them in sports or with chores.
*Scrapper Smith – boy with a shaggy side-part with dimpled cheeks who loves fighting; stayed on to live in the castle. He received a two-series spin-off in 1955.
*Rosie – short girl with curly blonde hair who loves cooking
*Snitch and Snatch – identical twins in babygrows who cause mischief and mayhem. They were the last members to join, first appearing in issue 18.

====The new friends from 1950 onwards====
*Joe – the dapper, overweight boy from &quot;Big Fat Joe&quot;, which was also a first issue &quot;Beano&quot; comic strip (ended issue 35). Like Snooty, he featured in the 65th anniversary issue, starring alongside Billy Whizz.
*Liz – former star of &quot;Swanky, Lanky Liz&quot; (issue 336 to 368) by Charles Holt. Liz continued her traits of being snobbish and vain.
*Thomas – innocent, large-eyed former star of &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; (ran from issues 90 to 174) by James Crighton.
*Polly – former star of &quot;Polly Wolly Doodle and her Great Big Poodle&quot; by George Drysdale, which appeared between issues 286 and 306. It was about the misadventures of Polly and her poodle Pongo, who also joins her in the crossover.
*Mary – the stubborn mule from &quot;Contrary Mary&quot; by Roland Davies. The series was also in the first issue of &quot;The Beano&quot; (ended issue 97) that was reprinted as &quot;Neddy the Cuddy&quot; in &quot;The People&#x27;s Journal&quot;.

===Other characters===
*Professor Screwtop – inventor who always has a new invention ready for trial tests; first appeared in issue 40. He occasionally appeared in other Beano strips such as the Bash Street Kids. Since 2017, he has appeared in the TV series &quot;Dennis &amp; Gnasher: Unleashed!&quot; along with his daughter, Rubidium &quot;Rubi&quot;.
*Angus – Snooty&#x27;s pet stag. First appeared in issue 1536.
*Cyril – the Castle Jackdaw.
*The Gasworks Gang – sworn enemies of Snooty and his pals. First appeared in issue 11, dubbed the &quot;Toughs from Gas Lane&quot;.
*Dudley D. Watkins cameoed in issue 170 to teach the children how to draw, but when the Ash-Can kids discover Watkins is creating a comic starring the boys from Gasworks, Snooty uses his drawing practice to modify the story, leading to the offended Gasworks boys attacking Watkins.

==Reception and legacy==
Lord Snooty is often regarded as part of the golden age of comic characters and has become one of few to earn his own collection of strips. It was a popular strip upon its release with Wee Peem and Little Dead-Eye Dick, possibly because the working-class children would relate to Snooty venturing with children from their family background. The media wrote of its shock when the series was cancelled in 1991: Mr Pepys called it &quot;[an] occasion for nationwide mourning&quot;; &quot;The Guardian&quot; implied its inference of paranoia and cowardice in Dr John Casey&#x27;s article about the event in &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; because of Casey comparing it to &quot;John Major&#x27;s drive for a classless society, a concept which does not go down very well in the sort of Scrutonian circles to which John Casey belongs.&quot; The new editor, Euan Kerr, admitted being apathetic towards the series, mostly because 1990s&#x27; children were far removed from a story about characters from the early 20th century. &quot;The sad truth is that he regularly came at the bottom of readers&#x27; popularity polls,&quot; he explained. &quot;His top hat and Eton collar must baffle today&#x27;s kids. At the time he was created in 1938, it was a more divided society and children at that stage would like to have been like him and live in a castle.&quot;

Lord Snooty was name checked on the 1967 Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band recording, &quot;The Intro and the Outro.&quot; Pop art company Art &amp; Hue featured Snooty as a member of their &quot;Beano&quot; 80th anniversary portraits.

=== &quot;Lord Snooty&quot; as slang ===
In popular British culture, &quot;Lord Snooty&quot; is pejorative to describe a high-profile person (usually a politician) from an upper middle class family who is too privileged to relate to the rest of the United Kingdom, despite how hard they try to. In 1995, Craig Brown criticised Roy Hattersley for claiming Eton College was the wrong school to send teenaged Prince William because Lord Snooty attended it, writing in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;: &quot;I doubt the creators at the Dundee firm of DC Thomson ever intended [Snooty and the children of Ash-Can Alley] to be thought of as Etonians.&quot;

When Charles Moore was announced as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s new editor, some critiques believed his &quot;sobriquet of Lord Snooty&quot; would bring a conservative agenda to the newspaper, according to Stephen Clover, who ended his overview with: &quot;Lord Snooty does know what they are thinking in the suburbs and market towns rather better than most of [Charles Moore&#x27;s] metropolitan critics.&quot; Moore would later write about David Cameron in 2009, theorising that Cameron shared similarities to friend-to-the-poor Lord Snooty, as well as Snooty&#x27;s &quot;repulsive&quot; grandson, in his attempt to befriend the poor like both boys. Alex Salmond also called the Cameron-led Conservative government &quot;a bunch of incompetent Lord Snootys&quot; in 2012.

Shona McIsaac used the comic strip to describe her doubts that hereditary peers would still have power in The House of Lords: &quot;If &quot;The Beano&quot;, which is a far more loved institution than the House of Lords, can get rid of Lord Snooty, the parliamentary Bash Street Kids can certainly get rid of hereditary peers.&quot;

A by-election leaflet depicting Edward Timpson photoshopped wearing a top hat in 2008 did not have explicit ties to the comic strip character, but alleged Labour Party campaigns to make voters draw comparisons were nicknamed such.

== Spin-offs ==
=== &quot;Scrapper&quot; (1955–1957, 1959) ===

George Drysdale and Albert Holroyd alternated as illustrators for the &quot;Lord Snooty and His Pals&quot; spin-off &quot;Scrapper&quot;. Starring Snooty&#x27;s friend Scrapper Smith, the comic strip documents Scrapper&#x27;s desire to have physical altercations with others and going to extreme lengths to do so. Being one of the only original friends from Ash Can Alley to still feature in &quot;The Beano&quot;, Smith had noticeably changed appearance since his debut, becoming curly-haired, taller and with broad shoulders, despite Snooty never changing appearance or an implication in Snooty&#x27;s universe that significant time passed for a drastic transformation.

There were two series between 1955 and 1959. Due to DC Thomson keeping published works uncredited, it is unknown how many or which comic strips were illustrated by Drysdale or Holroyd, but documents credit Holroyd as the sole designer for the second series. 
===&quot;Lord Snooty the Third&quot; (2008–2011)===

Issue 3439 introduced &quot;Lord Snooty the Third&quot;, illustrated by Nigel Parkinson. It stars a mischievous boy who lives in a castle, establishing this by showing him jetskiing on Lake Snooty. Although it was originally entered as part of the New Bash Street Kid competition, the following issue reveals this new character is Marmaduke&#x27;s grandson, showing a distinctive and recognisable &quot;Grandad&quot; in the family portrait gallery. Later on, Snooty the Third became a spy, parodying James Bond.

Snooty III also has a long-suffering and sarcastic butler named Parkinson. He has also formed his own gang, consisting of an adolescent named Naz, a young girl named Frankie, Emo, and One and Three the triplets (who claim that Two does not &quot;hang out&quot; with them much). The strip did not prove popular among readers and the comic series officially ended in 2011 after making less frequent appearances.

<doc id="318662" wikidata="Q76471" url="?curid=318662" title="Long-billed curlew">
<text>The long-billed curlew (Numenius americanus) is a large North American shorebird of the family Scolopacidae. This species was also called &quot;sicklebird&quot; and the &quot;candlestick bird&quot;. The species breeds in central and western North America, migrating southward and coastward for the winter.

==Description==

The long-billed curlew is the largest sandpiper of regular occurrence in North America. It is long, across the wing and weighs . Its disproportionally long bill curves downward and measures , and rivals the bill of the larger-bodied Far Eastern curlew as the longest bill of any shorebird. Individuals have a long neck and a small head. The neck and underparts are a light cinnamon in color, while the crown is streaked with brown. This species exhibits reversed sexual dimorphism, as in many sandpipers, the female being larger and having a much longer bill than the male&#x27;s.

==Breeding==

The breeding habitat is grasslands in west-central North America. The species displays an elaborate courtship dance, with fast and looping display flights also being common. A small hollow is lined with various weeds and grasses to serve as the nest. The species is a determinant layer, a characteristic of shorebirds, laying four eggs, which vary in hue from white to olive. The young of the Long-billed curlew are precocial, the chicks leaving the nest soon after hatching. Though both parents look after the young, females usually abandon the brood to the male 1–3 weeks after hatching and depart for winter grounds. Adults whose nest fails often depart immediately (or nearly so) for winter grounds.

==Feeding==
Long-billed curlews often feed in flocks. Using the long bill, an individual probes the mud or other substrate for suitable food. The usual food consists of crabs and various other small invertebrates. The species also feeds on grasshoppers, beetles, and other insects. This bird has been known to occasionally eat the eggs of other birds.

==Conservation status==
The population was significantly reduced at the end of the 19th century by hunting, though numbers have rebounded somewhat in more-recent times. The species was formerly classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN, but new research has confirmed that the long-billed curlew is again common and widespread. Consequently, it has been downlisted to Least Concern status in 2008.

Candlestick Point in San Francisco was named after this indigenous bird, and subsequently Candlestick Park stadium inherited the name. The species had dramatically declined in the San Francisco area by the early 20th century already, being &quot;practically extinct&quot; in San Mateo County in 1916. By the time the stadium was constructed in the 1950s, there was no remnant of the huge, local flocks of &quot;candlestick birds&quot; left.

The long-billed curlew was also formerly a plentiful wintering bird on the East Coast of the United States, and John James Audubon&#x27;s painting of the species was in fact of individuals he sighted near Charleston, South Carolina. However, market hunting and breeding habitat loss nearly wiped out this population, and presently only a small &quot;ghost&quot; or relict population of less than a hundred birds still winters on the East Coast, and this population has yet to recover. It is possible that this wintering population may have consisted largely of now-extirpated birds that bred on the eastern Great Plains, and the disappearance of those birds may tie in to the near disappearance of the Atlantic wintering population, with the present Atlantic wintering population being the descendants of the last survivors of the eastern Great Plains breeders. In December 2015, one such &quot;ghost bird&quot; was successfully captured off the coast of Georgia and fitted with a satellite tag with plans to analyze its migration routes, with it taking flight in April 2016.

Cross Hills is in Airedale at a point where the River Aire bends east from its north–south course. The village lies on the south bank of the river just above the flood plain, which is wholly agricultural. As its name implies, Cross Hills is surrounded by the hills of the eastern Pennines including Steeton Moor (south-east), Cowling Moor (south-west), White Hill (north-west) and Kildwick Moor (north-east). There are views along the Aire Valley itself to the north and east. Rombalds Moor, between Silsden and Ilkley, is about six miles east of Cross Hills. Skipton is about four miles north and the hills of the Yorkshire Dales can be seen beyond it.

Immediately south-west of Cross Hills is Glusburn. Due north, on the other side of the River Aire is Kildwick. Sutton-in-Craven is less than a mile to the south-west and Eastburn less than a mile to the south-east. Cross Hills is separated from Sutton-in-Craven and Eastburn by the beck which flows into the Aire just east of Cross Hills. The beck is known by various names: Surgill Beck, Holme Beck and Eastburn Beck. It forms part of the county boundary between North and West Yorkshire as it approaches the Aire, Eastburn being in West Yorkshire.

Cross Hills is split by the Airedale Line of the former Midland Railway. The biggest part is south of the railway and is largely residential with most of the shops and restaurants on or near Main Street (the A6068). North of the railway, former farmland has been given over to light industry and commerce but with some residential property on Station Road which connects the A6068 and the A629.

==History==
The village originated as an outgrowth of the much older Glusburn (which is mentioned in the Domesday Book).

Cross Hills is overlooked by two monuments known as The Pinnacles, which take the form of small towers, standing on Earl Crag above Cowling Moor:
* Wainman&#x27;s Pinnacle or Sutton&#x27;s Spare Pinnacle, is an obelisk built reportedly by a local man named Richard or William Wainman, some time between 1816 and 1830. There are varying accounts of the date and reasons for its construction: one anecdote claims that it was a memorial to Wainman&#x27;s son, who had been killed during the Napoleonic Wars, while another account suggests that it commemorates the Allied victory at the Battle of Waterloo (1815).
* Lund&#x27;s Tower, or Sutton Pinnacle was built in 1896 by James Lund of Malsis Hall, to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee; it is square with an internal staircase and topped by a crenelated parapet.
The Pinnacles are known colloquially as the &quot;Salt Pot&quot; and &quot;Pepper Pot&quot;; both stand in the parish of Sutton.

==Transport==
The village is close to the main A629, connecting Keighley and Skipton. The A6068 trans-Pennine route from Colne forms the village&#x27;s Main Street and joins the A629 at the large roundabout between Cross Hills and nearby Kildwick. The A6068 forms Colne Road through Glusburn and becomes Main Street at the junction with Wheatlands Lane. It joins Park Road, which climbs due west out of the village and provides routes to Cononley and Lothersdale.

There are regular bus services between Keighley, Skipton, Burnley and Colne that serve the village.

The local Kildwick and Crosshills railway station, opened in 1847, was closed in 1965. It was just off Station Road where the humpback bridge crosses the railway. The nearest station is now Steeton and Silsden, two miles to the east.

==Amenities==
The village has a large health centre on Holme Lane and is only a mile or so from the Airedale NHS Trust hospital at Steeton with Eastburn in West Yorkshire. There is a public library and a police station. South Craven School, a secondary and sixth form college, is located in Cross Hills off Holme Lane, which is the road from Cross Hills to Sutton-in-Craven. The local primary schools are in Sutton-in-Craven, Glusburn and Kildwick.

Cross Hills has no Church of England parish church of its own and is part of the parish of St Andrew&#x27;s Church across the Aire in Kildwick. Cross Hills contains St Peter&#x27;s Methodist Church, St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church and South Craven Evangelical Church.

Cross Hills Football Club plays in the Craven and District Football League and Glusburn Cricket Club is also located in the area. The Cross Hills tennis and bowling club has three tennis courts and one bowling green.

==Commerce==
Cross Hills was the original home of chocolatier Whitakers, now based in Skipton, which was established in 1889. Ida Whitaker began making chocolates in 1903, taught by the wife of the vicar of Kildwick.

==Notable people==
The Yorkshire and England cricketer Herbert Sutcliffe died in a Cross Hills nursing home on 22 January 1978, aged 83.

J. Arthur Dixon (1897–1958), founder of the eponymous manufacturer of greetings cards and postcards, was born at Cross Hills.

<text>The Metabetchouan River (French: Métabetchouane) is a tributary of Lac Saint-Jean in the centre of the province of Quebec, Canada. The course of this river successively crosses the regional county municipalities (MRC) of:
* La Jacques-Cartier Regional County Municipality (administrative region of Capitale-Nationale): in the unorganized territory of Lac-Croche;
* La Tuque (administrative region of Mauricie):
* Lac-Saint-Jean-Est Regional County Municipality (administrative region of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean): in the unorganized territory of Lac-Moncouche;
* Le Domaine-du-Roy Regional County Municipality (administrative region of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean): in the municipality of Saint-André-du-Lac-Saint-Jean.

It ends at Desbiens, where a cave called Le trou de la Fée is located. Its source are the Mâles and Bouteille Lakes in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve and it is long.

The river has been dammed for hydroelectric power. Now, it is also a tourist river with rafting, canoeing, and fishing opportunities. It is known for its reserve of fresh-water salmon. In the region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, this fish is known as &quot;Ouananiche&quot;.

This watercourse begins in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. The course of this river constitutes:
* the western limit of the territory of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, between Lac Long and Métabetchouane Lake;
* the eastern limit of the controlled harvesting zone Zec Kiskissink and the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve;
* the boundary between the municipalities of Lac-Bouchette and Saint-André-du-Lac-Saint-Jean.

The Métabetchouane river valley is mainly accessible by:
* intermediate part: forest road R0279 passing north of Saint-Henri Lake;
* lower part: route 169 along the south shore of lac Saint-Jean, the Trou-de-la-Fée road, the Chambord road, the rang path Saint-Hilaire.

The surface of the Métabetchoune River (except the rapids zones) is usually frozen from the end of November to the beginning of April, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to the end of March.

== Geography ==
With an average flow of 47 m3/s, it takes its source in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. It has several falls, including the &quot;chute à l&#x27;Épouvante&quot; (Fall to the Horror) and the Martine Fall.

The main watersheds neighboring the Métabetchouane River are:
* north side: lac Saint-Jean;
* east side: Métabetchouane East River, rivière aux Écorces, Pikauba River, Saguenay River;
* south side: Batiscan River, Jacques-Cartier River;
* west side: Bouchette Lake, Lac des Commissaires, Ouiatchouan River, Ouellet River.

The Métabetchouane river rises at the mouth of Lac des Mâles (length: ; altitude: ). This lake is enclosed between mountains, one peak of which to the east and another to in the southwest. This lake is mainly fed by the outlet (coming from the west) of lakes Hansel, Gretel, Petit lac Matteau and lac Matteau. Its mouth is located north at: south-east of lac aux Rognons, west of Petit lac Jacques-Cartier, northeast of Batiscan Lake, east of Lac-Édouard, northeast of Beaudet station on the Canadian National railway, northwest of fire tower which was built at the top of Mont McKinney and west of the course of the Jacques-Cartier River.

From its source, the course of the Métabetchouane river descends on , with a drop of , according to the following segments:

Upper course of the Métabetchouane river (from its source) (segment of )

* first towards the north, then on towards the east by crossing the south-eastern part of Lac de la Bouteille (length: ; altitude: ), to its mouth;
* towards the north by collecting (coming from the south-east) the outlet of Lac Gazaille, up to the outlet (coming from the east) of Lac Compagnay and Petit Lac Compagnay;
* first towards the west while winding, then towards the northwest, and crossing lac aux Rognons (length: ; altitude: ) on to the north, bypassing a peninsula from the east, to its mouth;

* to the north by collecting the discharge (coming from the west) from Lac de la Place, crossing Clairière lake in the marsh area, and crossing on north-west the southern part of Petit lac Métascouac (length: ; altitude: ), up to its mouth. Note: The small Métascouac lake receives from the north the Métascouac River;

Upper course of the Métabetchouane river (downstream of Petit lac Métascouac) (segment of )

* towards the northwest by forming a loop towards the south at the beginning of the segment, then crossing Hugh Lake (length: ; altitude: ) over its full length, to its mouth;
* northwards crossing Saint-Henri Lake (length: ; altitude: ), to its mouth;
* first towards the north passing under the bridge of the forest road R0279, then curving towards the west, and the northwest crossing Lake Long (length: ; altitude: ) to its mouth;
* towards the northwest by bending to the east at the end of the segment, until the confluence of the Rivière aux Montagnais (coming from the northeast);
* to the west by forming two detours to the north, up to Naquagami bay (eastern part of Métabetchouane Lake);
* towards the northwest by crossing Métabetchouane Lake (altitude: ) over its full length, up to its mouth;

Intermediate course of the Métabetchouane river (downstream of Métabetchouane lake) (segment of )

* to the north by collecting the discharge (coming from the northwest) from Lac du Vison, Georgette and Muskrat, forming a loop to the north to go around a mountain by crossing rapids, and a second loop where it collecting the discharge (coming from the east) of the lake of Félins, and collecting at the end of the segment the discharge (coming from the southwest) of the lakes Honorat and the Mares, up to the confluence of the rivière à la Chute (coming from the northwest);
* towards the south-east by forming a curve towards the north to bypass a mountain, then curving towards the north-east by forming a detour towards the west where it crosses rapids, making a curve towards the east, to the confluence of the Rivière de la Chaîne (coming from the northwest);
* first towards the north, then by bending towards the northeast, collecting at the end of the segment the discharge (coming from the west) from Lake Pichou and the discharge from Lac des Two Clubs, up to the outlet of Lake Huard (coming from the southeast);
* northwards to Rivière aux Canots (coming from the east);

Intermediate course of the Métabetchouane river (downstream of the Rivière aux Canots) (segment of )

* towards the northwest by collecting the Black stream (coming from the southwest) at the beginning of the segment, curving towards the west crossing a long series of rapids and forming a loop towards the north, up to the Carcajou stream (coming from the south);
* towards the northwest by forming a hook towards the north crossing the White Fall and several rapids, up to the Louise stream (coming from the northeast);
* towards the northwest by forming a loop towards the southwest at the start of the segment, up to the outlet (coming from the northeast) from Petit lac à la Carpe;
* north-west until the confluence of the Carpe River;

Lower course of the Métabetchouane river (segment of )

* north-east passing in front of the village of Saint-André-du-Lac-Saint-Jean, up to the Prudent River (coming from South);
* first towards the north-east until mid-segment, then towards the north passing in front of the hamlet &quot;La Martine&quot; and bypassing Île à Ringuette, to the confluence of the Grande Rivière Désir (coming from the west);
* to the east by crossing a dike, then a few rapids, to a bend in the river;
* to the north in a deep valley crossing Martine Falls, forming a detour west to go around a mountain, passing on the east side of the Twin Mountains and crossing on the bay of Villa-des-Érables, passing under the bridge of route 169 and under the railway bridge of Canadian National, up to at its mouth. Note: The MacDonald River flows onto the east shore of this bay.

At its mouth on the south shore of lac Saint-Jean, the Métabetchouane river forms a small lake, between the village of Chambord to the west and Desbiens to the east.

From the mouth of the Métabetchouane river on the south shore of lac Saint-Jean, the current crosses the latter on towards the northeast, then follows the course of the Saguenay River via La Petite Décharge on until Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.

== Toponymy ==
Its name is of Innu origin, but cognates exist in other Cree and Anishinabe dialects. From the roots &quot;matabi&quot; and &quot;djiwan&quot; (spelled matapetshuan in the modern Innu orthography), it can be translated as &quot;river that empties into a lake&quot;.

== History ==
The mouth of the river may have been a seasonal Innu camp for thousands of years and the river itself was used as a route between Lake Saint-Jean and the Quebec City region. Important archaeological excavations on the banks of the river led, in the 1960s, to the discovery of a site frequented by the Amerindians since approximately 5000 years. In 1647, Jean de Quen was the first European to visit the place but his report did not make mention of the river. Some two decades later in 1676, the first reference was made of this river as &quot;Metabeki8an&quot; in the second register of Tadoussac. A French trading post was erected at its mouth in 1676. That same year, Jesuits established the Saint-Charles Mission at the river&#x27;s mouth. In the mid 19th century, William Price began logging along the length of the river and it was used for a long time for log driving.

==United States==
Many state police agencies in the United States take the name of &quot;highway patrol&quot; rather than &quot;state police&quot;. State police agencies may fulfil the role of highway patrol, and vice versa. For instance, the Arizona Highway Patrol is actually a state police agency, meaning that it is a police body having statewide authority to conduct law enforcement activities and criminal investigations. In addition to its highway patrol duties, it performs functions outside the normal purview of the city police or the county sheriff, such as enforcing traffic laws on state highways and interstate expressways, overseeing the security of the state capitol complex and other state buildings, protecting the governor, providing technological and scientific support services, and helping to coordinate multi-jurisdictional task force activity in serious or complex cases. The California Highway Patrol serves as bailiffs and courtroom deputies for certain state courts, such as the appellate courts and the California Supreme Court building in San Francisco. The state traffic enforcement agency retained the name &quot;California Highway Patrol&quot; after the merger of the smaller California State Police with the larger and better-known CHP and the combination of their functions into one agency. On Long Island, New York, along with neighboring New York City, an unusual arrangement exists in which the city and county highway patrols conduct everyday enforcement on the limited-use highways, with the New York State Police acting in a support role on the limited-access highways within NYC, especially when NYPD Highway Patrol officers call for assistance or are unavailable due to limited manning and deployment elsewhere in NYC.

Some highway patrol organizations, such as the Florida Highway Patrol and North Carolina State Highway Patrol, are specifically charged with the enforcement of traffic laws, and while able to enforce other laws, they are &quot;not&quot; an official &quot;state police&quot; agency, yet retain their statewide jurisdiction in the same vein as the California Highway Patrol or the New Jersey State Police. States like Texas have a bona fide and appropriately named state police department such as the Texas Department of Public Safety, of which only one arm is a highway patrol division. In addition, the police departments of Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Nassau and Suffolk counties in New York have highway patrol bureaus. These units have special uniforms for their highway duty- service caps with the wire grommet removed, giving the classic &quot;crusher&quot; look, leather jackets, riding breeches, riding boots, Sam Browne-style belts and lanyards for their service pistols. A privately compiled list of Highway Patrol organizations and similar state police agencies is available on the web. The Iowa State Patrol maintains a list of phone numbers and cell phone dialing codes for non-emergency calls to the dispatchers of the Highway Patrol organizations in all 50 states. These numbers are useful for motorists who want to report aggressive driving, driving under the influence, or other dangerous but not life-threatening situations that do not require a 9-1-1 call.

Highway patrol and state police officers are often referred to as a &quot;state trooper&quot;. Historically, a troop was a small cavalry unit. Many state police forces originated as mounted paramilitary forces who were stationed in barracks like soldiers, hence the term &quot;trooper.&quot; Some agencies, particularly on the East Coast, refer to their state police offices as &quot;barracks&quot;, although troopers generally do not reside there. Other state police forces, particularly highway patrols as in California, have always modeled themselves after police officers who simply commute to work like ordinary civilians. Like police officers, they use the title &quot;officer.&quot; Other states use the term &quot;Patrolmen&quot; in reference to members of the State Police or Highway Patrol.

Many states and their Departments of Transportation have organized government-run freeway service patrols, Highway Assistance Patrols, or Highway Safety Patrols, to assist with highway emergencies as needed. While not law enforcement personnel, these persons provide free service to motorists in distress, and secure lanes of traffic, provide emergency medical assistance, request tow trucks for vehicles in inconvenient or dangerous locations, remove debris from the roadway after a crash, and resolve minor disabled vehicle problems, such as flat tires, jumpstarts, or pushing a disabled vehicle out of travel lanes. Many of these patrols work directly with the State Police and Highway Operations departments of their state, and respond to assistance when a citizen calls 911 for minor roadside assistance duties.

<text>The IBM 1013 Card Transmission Terminal was a device manufactured by IBM in 1961 which transmitted the data held on 80-column cards to a remote computer or another 1013.
The speed was generally considered 100 cards per minute but could be faster if programmed to send/receive only a portion of the cards if all 80 columns were not used. It needed a full-duplex circuit to operate but at any given time could only transmit or receive.

<text>Schizosaccharomyces pombe, also called &quot;fission yeast&quot;, is a species of yeast used in traditional brewing and as a model organism in molecular and cell biology. It is a unicellular eukaryote, whose cells are rod-shaped. Cells typically measure 3 to 4 micrometres in diameter and 7 to 14 micrometres in length. Its genome, which is approximately 14.1 million base pairs, is estimated to contain 4,970 protein-coding genes and at least 450 non-coding RNAs.

These cells maintain their shape by growing exclusively through the cell tips and divide by medial fission to produce two daughter cells of equal size, which makes them a powerful tool in cell cycle research.

Fission yeast was isolated in 1893 by Paul Lindner from East African millet beer. The species name &quot;pombe&quot; is the Swahili word for beer. It was first developed as an experimental model in the 1950s: by Urs Leupold for studying genetics, and by Murdoch Mitchison for studying the cell cycle.

Paul Nurse, a fission yeast researcher, successfully merged the independent schools of fission yeast genetics and cell cycle research. Together with Lee Hartwell and Tim Hunt, Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work on cell cycle regulation.

The sequence of the &quot;S. pombe&quot; genome was published in 2002, by a consortium led by the Sanger Institute, becoming the sixth model eukaryotic organism whose genome has been fully sequenced. S. pombe researchers are supported by the PomBase MOD (model organism database). This has fully unlocked the power of this organism, with many genes orthologous to human genes identified — 70% to date, including many genes involved in human disease. In 2006, sub-cellular localization of almost all the proteins in &quot;S. pombe&quot; was published using green fluorescent protein as a molecular tag.

&quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; has also become an important organism in studying the cellular responses to DNA damage and the process of DNA replication.

Approximately 160 natural strains of &quot;S. pombe&quot; have been isolated. These have been collected from a variety of locations including Europe, North and South America, and Asia. The majority of these strains have been collected from cultivated fruits such as apples and grapes, or from the various alcoholic beverages, such as Brazilian Cachaça. &quot;S. pombe&quot; is also known to be present in fermented tea, kombucha. It is not clear at present whether &quot;S. pombe&quot; is the major fermenter or a contaminant in such brews. The natural ecology of &quot;Schizosaccharomyces&quot; yeasts is not well-studied.

== History ==
&quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; was first discovered in 1893 when a group working in a Brewery Association Laboratory in Germany was looking at sediment found in millet beer imported from East Africa that gave it an acidic taste. The term schizo, meaning &quot;split&quot; or &quot;fission&quot;, had previously been used to describe other Schizosaccharomycetes. The addition of the word pombe was due to its isolation from East African beer, as pombe means &quot;beer&quot; in Swahili. The standard &quot;S. pombe&quot; strains were isolated by Urs Leupold in 1946 and 1947 from a culture that he obtained from the yeast collection in Delft, The Netherlands. It was deposited there by A. Osterwalder under the name &quot;S. pombe&quot; var. &quot;liquefaciens&quot;, after he isolated it in 1924 from French wine (most probably rancid) at the Federal Experimental Station of Vini- and Horticulture in Wädenswil, Switzerland. The culture used by Urs Leupold contained (besides others) cells with the mating types h90 (strain 968), h- (strain 972), and h+ (strain 975). Subsequent to this, there have been two large efforts to isolate &quot;S. pombe&quot; from fruit, nectar, or fermentations: one by Florenzano et al. in the vineyards of western Sicily, and the other by Gomes et al. (2002) in four regions of southeast Brazil.

== Ecology ==
The fission yeast &quot;S. pombe&quot; belongs to the division Ascomycota, which represents the largest and most diverse group of fungi. Free-living ascomycetes are commonly found in tree exudates, on plant roots and in surrounding soil, on ripe and rotting fruits, and in association with insect vectors that transport them between substrates. Many of these associations are symbiotic or saprophytic, although numerous ascomycetes (and their basidiomycete cousins) represent important plant pathogens that target myriad plant species, including commercial crops. Among the ascomycetous yeast genera, the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces&quot; is unique because of the deposition of α-(1,3)-glucan or pseudonigeran in the cell wall in addition to the better known β-glucans and the virtual lack of chitin. Species of this genus also differ in mannan composition, which shows terminal d-galactose sugars in the side-chains of their mannans. &quot;S. pombe&quot; undergo aerobic fermentation in the presence of excess sugar. &quot;S. pombe&quot; can degrade L-malic acid, one of the dominant organic acids in wine, which makes them diverse among other &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; strains.

==Comparison with budding yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;)==
The yeast species &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; and &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; are both extensively studied; these two species diverged approximately 300 to 600 million years before present, and are significant tools in molecular and cellular biology. Some of the technical discriminants between these two species are:

* &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has approximately 5,600 open reading frames; &quot;S. pombe&quot; has approximately 5,070 open reading frames.
* Despite similar gene numbers, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has only about 250 introns, while &quot;S. pombe&quot; has nearly 5,000.
* &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has 16 chromosomes, &quot;S. pombe&quot; has 3.
* &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is often diploid while &quot;S. pombe&quot; is usually haploid.
* &quot;S. pombe&quot; has a shelterin-like telomere complex while &quot;S. cerevisiae &quot; does not. 
* &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is in the G1 phase of the cell cycle for an extended period (as a consequence, G1-S transition is tightly controlled), while &quot;S. pombe&quot; remains in the G2 phase of the cell cycle for an extended period (as a consequence, G2-M transition is under tight control).
* Both species share genes with higher eukaryotes that they do not share with each other. &quot;S. pombe&quot; has RNAi machinery genes like those in vertebrates, while this is missing from &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; also has greatly simplified heterochromatin compared to &quot;S. pombe&quot;. Conversely, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has well-developed peroxisomes, while &quot;S. pombe&quot; does not.
* &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has small point centromere of 125 bp, and sequence-defined replication origins of about the same size. On the converse, &quot;S. pombe&quot; has large, repetitive centromeres (40–100 kb) more similar to mammalian centromeres, and degenerate replication origins of at least 1kb.

==S. pombe pathways and cellular processes==
&quot;S. pombe&quot; gene products (proteins and RNAs) participate in many cellular processes common across all life. The fission yeast GO slim provides a categorical high level overview of the biological role of all &quot;S. pombe&quot; gene products.

==Life cycle==

The fission yeast is a single-celled fungus with simple, fully characterized genome and a rapid growth rate. It has long been used in brewing, baking, and molecular genetics. &quot;S. pombe&quot; is a rod-shaped cell, approximately 3 μm in diameter, that grows entirely by elongation at the ends. After mitosis, division occurs by the formation of a septum, or cell plate, that cleaves the cell at its midpoint.

The central events of cell reproduction are chromosome duplication, which takes place in S (Synthetic) phase, followed by chromosome segregation and nuclear division (mitosis) and cell division (cytokinesis), which are collectively called M (Mitotic) phase. G1 is the gap between M and S phases, and G2 is the gap between S and M phases. In the fission yeast, the G2 phase is particularly extended, and cytokinesis (daughter-cell segregation) does not happen until a new S (Synthetic) phase is launched.

Fission yeast governs mitosis by mechanisms that are similar to those in multicellular animals. It normally proliferates in a haploid state. When starved, cells of opposite mating types (P and M) fuse to form a diploid zygote that immediately enters meiosis to generate four haploid spores. When conditions improve, these spores germinate to produce proliferating haploid cells.

== Cytokinesis ==
The general features of cytokinesis are shown here. The site of cell division is determined before anaphase. The anaphase spindle (in green on the figure) is then positioned so that the segregated chromosomes are on opposite sides of the predetermined cleavage plane.

== Size control ==
In fission yeast, where growth governs progression through G2/M, a wee1 mutation causes entry into mitosis at an abnormally small size, resulting in a shorter G2. G1 is lengthened, suggesting that progression through Start (beginning of cell cycle) is responsive to growth when the G2/M control is lost. Furthermore, cells in poor nutrient conditions grow slowly and therefore take longer to double in size and divide. Low nutrient levels also reset the growth threshold so that cell progresses through the cell cycle at a smaller size. Upon exposure to stressful conditions [heat (40 °C) or the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide] &quot;S. pombe&quot; cells undergo aging as measured by increased cell division time and increased probability of cell death. Finally, wee1 mutant fission yeast cells are smaller than wild-type cells, but take just as long to go through the cell cycle. This is possible because small yeast cells grow slower, that is, their added total mass per unit time is smaller than that of normal cells.

A spatial gradient is thought to coordinate cell size and mitotic entry in fission yeast.
The Pom1 protein kinase (green) is localized to the cell cortex, with the highest concentration at the cell tips. The cell-cycle regulators Cdr2, Cdr1 and Wee1 are present in cortical nodes in the middle of the cell (blue and red dots). a, In small cells, the Pom1 gradient reaches most of the cortical nodes (blue dots). Pom1 inhibits Cdr2, preventing Cdr2 and Cdr1 from inhibiting Wee1, and allowing Wee1 to phosphorylate Cdk1, thus inactivating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and preventing entry into mitosis. b, In long cells, the Pom1 gradient does not reach the cortical nodes (red dots), and therefore Cdr2 and Cdr1 remain active in the nodes. Cdr2 and Cdr1 inhibit Wee1, preventing phosphorylation of Cdk1 and thereby leading to activation of CDK and mitotic entry. (This simplified diagram omits several other regulators of CDK activity.)

==Mating-type switching==

Fission yeast switches mating type by a replication-coupled recombination event, which takes place during S phase of the cell cycle. Fission yeast uses intrinsic asymmetry of the DNA replication process to switch the mating type; it was the first system where the direction of replication was shown to be required for the change of the cell type. Studies of the mating-type switching system lead to a discovery and characterization of a site-specific replication termination site RTS1, a site-specific replication pause site MPS1, and a novel type of chromosomal imprint, marking one of the sister chromatids at the mating-type locus mat1. In addition, work on the silenced donor region has led to great advances in understanding formation and maintenance of heterochromatin.

==Responses to DNA damage==
&quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; is a facultative sexual microorganism that can undergo mating when nutrients are limiting. Exposure of &quot;S. pombe&quot; to hydrogen peroxide, an agent that causes oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage, strongly induces mating and formation of meiotic spores. This finding suggests that meiosis, and particularly meiotic recombination, may be an adaptation for repairing DNA damage. Supporting this view is the finding that single base lesions of the type dU:dG in the DNA of &quot;S. pombe&quot; stimulate meiotic recombination. This recombination requires uracil-DNA glycosylase, an enzyme that removes uracil from the DNA backbone and initiates base excision repair. On the basis of this finding, it was proposed that base excision repair of either a uracil base, an abasic site, or a single-strand nick is sufficient to initiate recombination in S. pombe. Other experiments with &quot;S. pombe&quot; indicated that faulty processing of DNA replication intermediates, i.e. Okazaki fragments, causes DNA damages such as single-strand nicks or gaps, and that these stimulate meiotic recombination.

==As a model system==

Fission yeast has become a notable model system to study basic principles of a cell that can be used to understand more complex organisms like mammals and in particular humans. This single cell eukaryote is nonpathogenic and easily grown and manipulated in the lab. Fission yeast contains one of the smallest numbers of genes of a known genome sequence for a eukaryote, and has only three chromosomes in its genome. Many of the genes responsible for cell division and cellular organization in fission yeast cell are also found in the human&#x27;s genome. Cell cycle regulation and division are crucial for growth and development of any cell. Fission yeast&#x27;s conserved genes has been heavily studied and the reason for many recent biomedical developments. Fission yeast is also a practical model system to observe cell division because fission yeast&#x27;s are cylindrically shaped single celled eukaryotes that divide and reproduce by medial fission. This can easily be seen using microscopy. Fission yeast also have an extremely short generation time, 2 to 4 hours, which also makes it an easy model system to observe and grow in the laboratory Fission yeast&#x27;s simplicity in genomic structure yet similarities with mammalian genome, ease of ability to manipulate, and ability to be used for drug analysis is why fission yeast is making many contributions to biomedicine and cellular biology research, and a model system for genetic analysis.

===Genome===

&quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; is often used to study cell division and growth because of conserved genomic regions also seen in humans including: heterochromatin proteins, large origins of replication, large centromeres, conserved cellular checkpoints, telomere function, gene splicing, and many other cellular processes. &quot;S. pombe&quot;″s genome was fully sequenced in 2002, the sixth eukaryotic genome to be sequenced as part of the Genome Project. An estimated 4,979 genes were discovered within three chromosomes containing about 14Mb of DNA. This DNA is contained within 3 different chromosomes in the nucleus with gaps in the centromeric (40kb) and telomeric (260kb) regions. After the initial sequencing of the fission yeast&#x27;s genome, other previous non-sequenced regions of the genes have been sequenced. Structural and functional analysis of these gene regions can be found on large scale fission yeast databases such as PomBase.

Forty-three percent of the genes in the Genome Project were found to contain introns in 4,739 genes. Fission yeast does not have as many duplicated genes compared to budding yeast, only containing 5%, making fission yeast a great model genome to observe and gives researchers the ability to create more functional research approaches. &quot;S. pombe&quot;″s having a large number of introns gives opportunities for an increase of range of protein types produced from alternative splicing and genes that code for comparable genes in human.
81% of the three centromeres in fission yeast have been sequenced. The lengths of the three centromeres were found to be 34, 65, and 110 kb. This is 300–100 times longer than the centromeres of budding yeast. An extremely high level of conservation (97%) is also seen over 1,780-bp region in the DGS regions of the centromere. This elongation of centromeres and its conservative sequences makes fission yeast a practical model system to use to observe cell division and in humans because of their likeness.

PomBase reports over 70% of protein coding genes have human orthologs and over 1500 of these are associated with human disease . This makes &quot;S. pombe&quot; a great system to use to study human genes and disease pathways, especially cell cycle and DNA checkpoint systems.

The genome of &quot;S. pombe&quot; contains meiotic drivers and drive suppressors called wtf genes.

===Genetic diversity===

Biodiversity and evolutionary study of fission yeast was carried out on 161 strains of &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; collected from 20 countries. Modeling of the evolutionary rate showed that all strains derived from a common ancestor that has lived since ~2,300 years ago. The study also identified a set of 57 strains of fission yeast that each differed by ≥1,900 SNPs, and all detected 57 strains of fission yeast were prototrophic (able to grow on the same minimal medium as the reference strain). A number of studies on S.pombe genome support the idea that the genetic diversity of fission yeast strains is slightly less than budding yeast. Indeed, only limited variations of S.pombe occur in proliferation in different environments. In addition, the amount of phenotypic variation segregating in fission yeast is less than that seen, in S. cerevisiae. Since most strains of fission yeast were isolated from brewed beverages, there is no ecological or historical context to this dispersal.

===Cell cycle analysis===

DNA replication in yeast has been increasingly studied by many researchers. Further understanding of DNA replication, gene expression, and conserved mechanisms in yeast can provide researchers with information on how these systems operate in mammalian cells in general and human cells in particular. Other stages, such as cellular growth and aging, are also observed in yeast in order to understand these mechanisms in more complex systems.

&quot;S. pombe&quot; stationary phase cells undergo chronological aging due to production of reactive oxygen species that cause DNA damages. Most such damages can ordinarily be repaired by DNA base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair. Defects in these repair processes lead to reduced survival.

Cytokinesis is one of the components of cell division that is often observed in fission yeast. Well-conserved components of cytokinesis are observed in fission yeast and allow us to look at various genomic scenarios and pinpoint mutations. Cytokinesis is a permanent step and very crucial to the wellbeing of the cell. Contractile ring formation in particular is heavily studied by researchers using &quot;S. pombe&quot; as a model system. The contractile ring is highly conserved in both fission yeast and human cytokinesis. Mutations in cytokinesis can result in many malfunctions of the cell including cell death and development of cancerous cells. This is a complex process in human cell division, but in &quot;S. pombe&quot; simpler experiments can yield results that can then be applied for research in higher-order model systems such as humans.

One of the safety precautions that the cell takes to ensure precise cell division occurs is the cell-cycle checkpoint. These checkpoints ensure any mutagens are eliminated. This is done often by relay signals that stimulate ubiquitination of the targets and delay cytokinesis. Without mitotic check points such as these, mutagens are created and replicated, resulting in multitudes of cellular issues including cell death or tumorigenesis seen in cancerous cells. Paul Nurse, Leland Hartwell, and Tim Hunt were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2001. They discovered key conserved checkpoints that are crucial for a cell to divide properly. These findings have been linked to cancer and diseased cells and are a notable finding for biomedicine.

Researchers using fission yeast as a model system also look at organelle dynamics and responses and the possible correlations between yeast cells and mammalian cells. Mitochondria diseases, and various organelle systems such as the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, can be further understood, by observing fission yeast&#x27;s chromosome dynamics and protein expression levels and regulation.

===Meiotic recombination===

RecA and RecA-like proteins are required for recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Five RecA-like proteins have been described in &quot;S. pombe&quot; that are linked to meiotic recombination, and all five RecA homologs appear to be required for normal levels of meiotic recombination.

===Biomedical tool===

However, there are limitations with using fission yeast as a model system: its multidrug resistance. &quot;The MDR response involves overexpression of two types of drug efflux pumps, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family... and the major facilitator superfamily&quot;. Paul Nurse and some of his colleagues have recently created &quot;S. pombe&quot; strains sensitive to chemical inhibitors and common probes to see whether it is possible to use fission yeast as a model system of chemical drug research.

For example, Doxorubicin, a very common chemotherapeutic antibiotic, has many adverse side-effects. Researchers are looking for ways to further understand how doxorubicin works by observing the genes linked to resistance by using fission yeast as a model system. Links between doxorubicin adverse side-effects and chromosome metabolism and membrane transport were seen. Metabolic models for drug targeting are now being used in biotechnology, and further advances are expected in the future using the fission yeast model system.

===Experimental approaches===

Fission yeast is easily accessible, easily grown and manipulated to make mutants, and able to be maintained at either a haploid or diploid state. &quot;S. pombe&quot; is normally a haploid cell but, when put under stressful conditions, usually nitrogen deficiency, two cells will conjugate to form a diploid that later form four spores within a tetrad ascus. This process is easily visible and observable under any microscope and allows us to look at meiosis in a simpler model system to see how this phenomenon operates.

Virtually any genetics experiment or technique can, therefore, be applied to this model system such as: tetrad dissection, mutagens analysis, transformations, and microscopy techniques such as FRAP and FRET. New models, such as Tug-Of-War (gTOW), are also being used to analyze yeast robustness and observe gene expression. Making knock-in and knock-out genes is fairly easy and with the fission yeast&#x27;s genome being sequenced this task is very accessible and well known.

<doc id="318672" wikidata="Q2355473" url="?curid=318672" title="Whakapapa">
<text>Whakapapa (, ), or genealogy, is a fundamental principle in Māori culture. Reciting one&#x27;s &quot;whakapapa&quot; proclaims one&#x27;s Māori identity, places oneself in a wider context, and links oneself to land and tribal groupings and their &quot;mana&quot;.

Experts in &quot;whakapapa&quot; can trace and recite a lineage not only through the many generations in a linear sense, but also between such generations in a lateral sense.

==Link with ancestry==
Raymond Firth, an acclaimed New Zealand economist and anthropologist during the early 20th century, asserted that there are four different levels of Māori kinship terminology that are as follows:

Some scholars have attributed this type of genealogical activity as being tantamount to ancestor worship. Most Māori would probably attribute this to ancestor reverence. Tribes and sub-tribes are mostly named after an ancestor (either male or female): for example, Ngāti Kahungunu means &#x27;descendants of &quot;Kahungunu&quot;&#x27; (a famous chief who lived mostly in what is now called the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region).

According to Atholl Anderson, &quot;[the] intensely pactical value of whakapapa that guaranteed their general accuracy&quot;. Ethnographer Walter Ong said of European dismissiveness of the accuracy of oral history like whakapapa: &quot;Oral cultures must invest great energy in saying over and over again what has been learnt arduously over the ages&quot;.

==Word associations==
Many physiological terms are also genealogical in &#x27;nature&#x27;. For example, the terms &#x27;iwi&#x27;, &#x27;hapu&#x27;, and &#x27;whānau&#x27; (as noted above) can also be translated in order as &#x27;bones&#x27;, &#x27;pregnant&#x27;, and &#x27;give birth&#x27;. The prize winning Māori author, Keri Hulme, named her best known novel as &quot;The Bone People&quot;: a title linked directly to the dual meaning of the word &#x27;iwi as both &#x27;bone&#x27; and &#x27;tribal people&#x27;.

Most formal orations (or whaikōrero) begin with the &quot;nasal&quot; expression - &quot;Tihei Mauriora&quot;! This is translated as the &#x27;Sneeze of Life&#x27;. In effect, the orator (whose &#x27;sneeze&#x27; reminds us of a newborn clearing his or her airways to take the first breath of life) is announcing that &#x27;his&#x27; speech has now begun, and that his &#x27;airways&#x27; are clear enough to give a suitable oration.

==Whakapapa in the mental health system==

Whakapapa is defined as the &quot;genealogical descent of all living things from God to the present time. &quot;Since all living things including rocks and mountains are believed to possess whakapapa, it is further defined as &quot;a basis for the organisation of knowledge in the respect of the creation and development of all things&quot;.

Hence, whakapapa also implies a deep connection to land and the roots of one&#x27;s ancestry. In order to trace one&#x27;s whakapapa it is essential to identify the location where one&#x27;s ancestral heritage began; &quot;you can’t trace it back any further&quot;. &quot;Whakapapa links all people back to the land and sea and sky and outer universe, therefore, the obligations of whanaungatanga extend to the physical world and all being in it&quot;. 

While some family and community health organisations may require details of whakapapa as part of client assessment, it is generally better if whakapapa is disclosed voluntarily by whānau, if they are comfortable with this. Usually details of a client&#x27;s whakapapa are not required since sufficient information can be obtained through their iwi identification. Cases where whakapapa may be required include adoption cases or situations where whakapapa information may be of benefit to the client&#x27;s health and well-being.

Whakapapa is also believed to determine an individual&#x27;s intrinsic tapu. &quot;Sharing whakapapa enables the identification of obligations...and gaining trust of participants&quot;. Additionally, since whakapapa is believed to be &quot;inextricably linked to the physical gene&quot;, concepts of tapu would still apply. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that appropriate cultural protocols are adhered to.

Misuse of such private and privileged information is of great concern to Māori. While whakapapa information may be disclosed to a &quot;kaimatai hinengaro&quot; in confidence, this information may be stored in databases that could be accessed by others. While most health professions are embracing technological advances of data storage, this may be an area of further investigation so that confidential information pertaining to a client&#x27;s whakapapa cannot be disclosed to others.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to find out if the client is comfortable with whakapapa information being stored in ways that have the potential to be disclosed to others. To combat such issues, a Māori Code of Ethics has been suggested. A Māori Code of Ethics may prevent &quot;the mismanagement or manipulation of either the information or the informants&quot;.

==Sport==
Although this rule was not rigorously applied in the past, people today have to prove whakapapa to become members of the international Māori All Blacks rugby union team, New Zealand Māori rugby league team and New Zealand Māori cricket team to qualify.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1981 with the song &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot;, composed by John Danter, with lyrics by Andy Hill, and performed by Bucks Fizz. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final titled &quot;A Song for Europe 1981&quot;. The entry eventually won the Eurovision Song Contest.

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1981&quot;===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reduced the number of finalists from twelve to eight in 1981. Terry Wogan hosted the national final on 11 March at the BBC Television Theatre in London. 581 songs were submitted to the Music Publisher&#x27;s Association to pick eight songs. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of John Coleman as conductor accompanied all the songs, but all the music was pre-recorded. The show was the 16th most watched programme of the week with a rating of 12.4 million viewers, the highest for three years. Johnny Logan was scheduled to appear as a guest on the programme, but had to cancel shortly before the air date.

Seven regional juries voted on the songs. The regional juries voted internally and awarded 15 points to their favourite song, 12 points to the second, 10 points to the third and then 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 points in order of preference for the songs from 4th to 8th. Before the reprise, Terry Wogan incorrectly read the title of the winning song as &quot;Where Are You Now.&quot; The prizes were presented by Wogan to John Danter, one of the songwriters, and to Mike Nolan, one of the performers.



=== UK Discography ===
Unusually for the UK competition, three of the finalists reached the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; spent three weeks at number one, whilst the runner-up, &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic!&quot; reached number 42 at more-or-less the same time. &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love?&quot; was a UK no.10 hit for Leo Sayer in 1982, also reaching no.4 in Australia. The track was covered by many other artists, including Peter Cetera and Westlife. &quot;For Only A Day&quot; was later used as the theme song for Miss World 1983, performed live by all the contestants during the broadcast.

<doc id="318677" wikidata="Q520275" url="?curid=318677" title="George W. Romney">
<text>George Wilcken Romney (July 8, 1907 – July 26, 1995) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served as chairman and president of American Motors Corporation from 1954 to 1962, the 43rd governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969, and 3rd secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1969 to 1973. He was the father of Mitt Romney, who served as one of the United States senators from Utah and formerly was a governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee; the husband of 1970 U.S. Senate candidate Lenore Romney; and the paternal grandfather of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel.

Romney was born to American parents living in the polygamist Mormon colonies in Mexico; events during the Mexican Revolution forced his family to flee back to the United States when he was a child. The family lived in several states and ended up in Salt Lake City, Utah, where they struggled during the Great Depression. Romney worked in a number of jobs, served as a Mormon missionary in the United Kingdom, and attended several colleges in the U.S. but did not graduate from any of them. In 1939, he moved to Detroit and joined the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, where he served as the chief spokesman for the automobile industry during World War II and headed a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share production improvements. He joined Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in 1948, and became the chief executive of its successor, American Motors, in 1954. There he turned around the struggling firm by focusing all efforts on the compact Rambler car. Romney mocked the products of the &quot;Big Three&quot; automakers as &quot;gas-guzzling dinosaurs&quot; and became one of the first high-profile, media-savvy business executives. Devoutly religious, he presided over the Detroit stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Having entered politics in 1961 by participating in a state constitutional convention to rewrite the Michigan Constitution, Romney was elected Governor of Michigan in 1962. Re-elected by increasingly large margins in 1964 and 1966, he worked to overhaul the state&#x27;s financial and revenue structure, greatly expanding the size of state government and introducing Michigan&#x27;s first state income tax. Romney was a strong supporter of the American Civil Rights Movement. He briefly represented moderate Republicans against conservative Republican Barry Goldwater during the 1964 U.S. presidential election. He requested the intervention of federal troops during the 1967 Detroit riot.

Initially a front runner for the Republican nomination for president of the United States in the 1968 election cycle, he proved an ineffective campaigner and fell behind Richard Nixon in polls. After a mid-1967 remark that his earlier support for the Vietnam War had been due to a &quot;brainwashing&quot; by U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Vietnam, his campaign faltered even more and he withdrew from the contest in early 1968. After being elected president, Nixon appointed Romney as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Romney&#x27;s ambitious plans, which included housing production increases for the poor and open housing to desegregate suburbs, were modestly successful but often thwarted by Nixon. Romney left the administration at the start of Nixon&#x27;s second term in 1973. Returning to private life, he advocated volunteerism and public service and headed the National Center for Voluntary Action and its successor organizations from 1973 through 1991. He also served as a regional representative of the Twelve within his church.

==Early life and background==
Romney&#x27;s grandparents were polygamous Mormons who fled the United States to Mexico with their children owing to the federal government&#x27;s prosecution of polygamy. His maternal grandfather was Helaman Pratt (1846–1909), who presided over the Mormon mission in Mexico City before moving to the Mexican state of Chihuahua and who was the son of original Mormon apostle Parley P. Pratt (1807–1857). In the 1920s, Romney&#x27;s uncle Rey L. Pratt (1878–1931) played a major role in the preservation and expansion of the Mormon presence in Mexico and in its introduction to South America. A more distant kinsman was George Romney (1734–1802), a noted portrait painter in Britain during the last quarter of the 18th century.

Romney&#x27;s parents, Gaskell Romney (1871–1955) and Anna Amelia Pratt (1876–1926), were United States citizens and natives of the Territory of Utah. They married in 1895 in Mexico and lived in Colonia Dublán in Nuevo Casas Grandes in the state of Chihuahua (one of the Mormon colonies in Mexico), where George was born on July 8, 1907. They practiced monogamy (polygamy having been abolished by the 1890 Manifesto, although it persisted in places, especially Mexico). George had three older brothers, two younger brothers, and a younger sister. Gaskell Romney was a successful carpenter, house builder, and farmer who headed the most prosperous family in the colony, which was situated in an agricultural valley below the Sierra Madre Occidental. The family chose U.S. citizenship for their children, including George.

The Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910 and the Mormon colonies were endangered in 1911–1912 by raids from marauders, including &quot;Red Flaggers&quot; Pascual Orozco and José Inés Salazar. Young George heard the sound of distant gunfire and saw rebels walking through the village streets. The Romney family fled and returned to the United States in July 1912, leaving their home and almost all of their property behind. Romney later said, &quot;We were the first displaced persons of the 20th century.&quot;

In the United States, Romney grew up in humble circumstances. The family subsisted with other Mormon refugees on government relief in El Paso, Texas, benefiting from a $100,000 fund for refugees that the U.S. Congress had set up. After a few months they moved to Los Angeles, California, where Gaskell Romney worked as a carpenter. In kindergarten, other children mocked Romney&#x27;s national origin by calling him &quot;Mex&quot;.
In 1913, the family moved to Oakley, Idaho, and bought a farm, where they grew and subsisted largely on Idaho potatoes. The farm was not sustainable and failed when potato prices fell. The family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1916, where Gaskell Romney resumed construction work, but the family remained generally poor. In 1917, they moved to Rexburg, Idaho, where Gaskell became a successful home and commercial builder in a growing area due to high World War I commodities prices.

George started working in wheat and sugar beet fields at the age of eleven and was the valedictorian at his grammar school graduation in 1921 (by the sixth grade he had attended six schools). The Depression of 1920–1921 brought a collapse in prices, and local building was abandoned. His family returned to Salt Lake City in 1921, and while his father resumed construction work, George became skilled at lath-and-plaster work. The family was again prospering when the Great Depression hit in 1929 and ruined them. George watched his parents fail financially in Idaho and Utah and having to take a dozen years to pay off their debts. Seeing their struggles influenced his life and business career.

In Salt Lake City, Romney worked while attending Roosevelt Junior High School and, beginning in 1922, Latter-day Saints High School. There he played halfback on the football team, guard on the basketball team, and right field on the baseball team, all with more persistence than talent, but in an effort to uphold the family tradition of athleticism, he earned varsity letters in all three sports. In his senior year, he and junior Lenore LaFount became high school sweethearts; she was from a more well-assimilated Mormon family. Academically, Romney was steady but undistinguished. He graduated from high school in 1925; his yearbook picture caption was &quot;Serious, high minded, of noble nature – a real fellow&quot;.

Partly to stay near Lenore, Romney spent the next year as a junior college student at the co-located Latter-day Saints University, where he was elected student body president. He was also president of the booster club and played on the basketball team that won the Utah–Idaho Junior College Tournament.

==Missionary work==
After becoming an elder, Romney earned enough money working to fund himself as a Mormon missionary. In October 1926, he sailed to Great Britain and was first assigned to preach in a slum in Glasgow, Scotland. The abject poverty and hopelessness he saw there affected him greatly, but he was ineffective in gaining converts and temporarily suffered a crisis of faith.

In February 1927, he was shifted to Edinburgh and in February 1928 to London, where he kept track of mission finances. He worked under renowned Quorum of the Twelve Apostles intellectuals James E. Talmage and John A. Widtsoe; the latter&#x27;s admonitions to &quot;Live mightily today, the greatest day of all time is today&quot; made a lasting impression on him. Romney experienced British sights and culture and was introduced to members of the peerage and the Oxford Group.

In August 1928, Romney became president of the Scottish missionary district. Operating in a whisky-centric region was difficult, and he developed a new &quot;task force&quot; approach of sending more missionaries to a single location at a time; this successfully drew local press attention and several hundred new recruits. Romney&#x27;s frequent public proselytizing – from Edinburgh&#x27;s Mound and in London from soap boxes at Speakers&#x27; Corner in Hyde Park and from a platform at Trafalgar Square – developed his gifts for debate and sales, which he would use the rest of his career. Three decades later, Romney said that his missionary time had meant more to him in developing his career than any other experience.

==Early career, marriage and children==
Romney returned to the U.S. in late 1928 and studied briefly at the University of Utah and LDS Business College. He followed LaFount to Washington, D.C., in fall 1929, after her father, Harold A. Lafount, had accepted an appointment by President Calvin Coolidge to serve on the Federal Radio Commission. He worked for Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Senator David I. Walsh during 1929 and 1930, first as a stenographer using speedwriting, then, when his abilities at that proved limited, as a staff aide working on tariffs and other legislative matters. Romney researched aspects of the proposed Smoot-Hawley tariff legislation and sat in on committee meetings; the job was a turning point in his career and gave him lifelong confidence in dealing with Congress.

With one of his brothers, Romney opened a dairy bar in nearby Rosslyn, Virginia, during this time. The business soon failed, in the midst of the Great Depression. He also attended George Washington University at night. Based upon a connection he made working for Walsh, Romney was hired as an apprentice for Alcoa in Pittsburgh in June 1930.

When LaFount, an aspiring actress, began earning bit roles in Hollywood movies, Romney arranged to be transferred to Alcoa&#x27;s Los Angeles office for training as a salesman. There he took night classes at the University of Southern California. Romney did not attend for long, or graduate from, any of the colleges in which he was enrolled, accumulating only 2½ years of credits; instead he has been described as an autodidact. LaFount had the opportunity to sign a $50,000, three-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, but Romney convinced her to return to Washington with him as he was assigned a position there with Alcoa as a lobbyist. She later said she had never had a choice of both marriage and an acting career, because the latter would have upstaged him, but expressed no regrets about having chosen the former. Romney would later consider wooing her his greatest sales achievement.

The couple married on July 2, 1931, at Salt Lake City Temple. They would have four children: Margo Lynn (born 1935), Jane LaFount (born 1938), George Scott (born 1941), and Willard Mitt (born 1947). The couple&#x27;s marriage reflected aspects of their personalities and courtship. George was devoted to Lenore, and tried to bring her a flower every day, often a single rose with a love note. George was also a strong, blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will, but the more self-controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him. The couple quarreled so much as a result that their grandchildren would later nickname them &quot;the Bickersons&quot; (after the radio comedy sketches), but in the end, their closeness would allow them to settle arguments amicably.

As a lobbyist, Romney frequently competed on behalf of the aluminum industry against the copper industry, and defended Alcoa against charges of being a monopoly. He also represented the Aluminum Wares Association. In the early 1930s, he helped get aluminum windows installed in the U.S. Department of Commerce Building, at the time the largest office building in the world.

Romney joined the National Press Club and the Burning Tree and Congressional Country Clubs; one reporter watching Romney hurriedly play golf at the last said, &quot;There is a young man who knows where he is going.&quot; Lenore&#x27;s cultural refinement and hosting skills, along with her father&#x27;s social and political connections, helped George in business, and the couple met the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, and other prominent Washington figures. He was chosen by Pyke Johnson, a Denver newspaperman and automotive industry trade representative he met at the Press Club, to join the newly formed Trade Association Advisory Committee to the National Recovery Administration. The committee&#x27;s work continued even after the agency was declared unconstitutional in 1935. During 1937 and 1938, Romney was also president of the Washington Trade Association Executives.

==Automotive industry representative==
After nine years with Alcoa, Romney&#x27;s career had stagnated; there were many layers of executives to climb through and a key promotion he had wanted was given to someone with more seniority. Pyke Johnson was vice president of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, which needed a manager for its new Detroit office. Romney got the job and moved there with his wife and two daughters in 1939. An association study found Americans using their cars more for short trips and convinced Romney that the trend was towards more functional, basic transportation. In 1942, he was promoted to general manager of the association, a position he held until 1948. Romney also served as president of the Detroit Trade Association in 1941.

In 1940, as World War II raged overseas, Romney helped start the Automotive Committee for Air Defense, which coordinated planning between the automobile and aircraft industries. Immediately following the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor that drew the U.S. into the war, Romney helped turn that committee into, and became managing director of, the Automotive Council for War Production. This organization established a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share machine tools and production improvements, thus maximizing the industry&#x27;s contribution to the war production effort. It embodied Romney&#x27;s notion of &quot;competitive cooperative capitalism&quot;.

With labor leader Victor Reuther, Romney led the Detroit Victory Council, which sought to improve conditions for Detroit workers under wartime stress and deal with the causes of the Detroit race riot of 1943. Romney successfully appealed to the Federal Housing Administration to make housing available to black workers near the Ford Willow Run plant. He also served on the labor-management committee of the Detroit section of the War Manpower Commission.

Romney&#x27;s influence grew while he positioned himself as chief spokesman of the automobile industry, often testifying before Congressional hearings about production, labor, and management issues; he was mentioned or quoted in over 80 stories in &quot;The New York Times&quot; during this time. By war&#x27;s end, 654 manufacturing companies had joined the Automotive Council for War Production, and produced nearly $29 billion in output for the Allied military forces. This included over 3 million motorized vehicles, 80 percent of all tanks and tank parts, 75 percent of all aircraft engines, half of all diesel engines, and a third of all machine guns. Between a fifth and a quarter of all U.S. wartime production was accounted for by the automotive industry.

As peacetime production began, Romney persuaded government officials to forgo complex contract-termination procedures, thus freeing auto plants to quickly produce cars for domestic consumption and avoid large layoffs. Romney was director of the American Trade Association Executives in 1944 and 1947, and managing director of the National Automobile Golden Jubilee Committee in 1946. From 1946 to 1949, he represented U.S. employers as a delegate to the Metal Trades Industry conference of the International Labor Office. By 1950, Romney was a member of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, and criticized racial segregation in Detroit&#x27;s housing program when speaking before the Detroit City Council. Romney&#x27;s personality was blunt and intense, giving the impression of a &quot;man in a hurry&quot;, and he was considered a rising star in the industry.

==American Motors Corporation chief executive==
As managing director of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, Romney became good friends with then-president George W. Mason. When Mason became chairman of the manufacturing firm Nash-Kelvinator in 1948, he invited Romney along &quot;to learn the business from the ground up&quot; as his roving assistant, and the new executive spent a year working in different parts of the company. At a Detroit refrigerator plant of the Kelvinator appliance division, Romney battled the Mechanics Educational Society of America union to institute a new industrial–labor relations program that forestalled the whole facility being shut down. He appealed to the workers by saying, &quot;I am no college man. I&#x27;ve laid floors, I&#x27;ve done lathing. I&#x27;ve thinned beets and shocked wheat.&quot; As Mason&#x27;s protégé, Romney assumed executive assignment for the development of the Rambler.

Mason had long sought a merger of Nash-Kelvinator with one or more other companies, and on May 1, 1954, it merged with Hudson Motor Car to become the American Motors Corporation (AMC). It was the largest merger in the history of the industry, and Romney became an executive vice president of the new firm. In October 1954, Mason suddenly died of acute pancreatitis and pneumonia. Romney was named AMC&#x27;s president and chairman of the board the same month.

When Romney took over, he canceled Mason&#x27;s plan to merge AMC with Studebaker-Packard Corporation (or any other automaker). He reorganized upper management, brought in younger executives, and pruned and rebuilt AMC&#x27;s dealer network. Romney believed that the only way to compete with the &quot;Big Three&quot; (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) was to stake the future of AMC on a new smaller-sized car line. Together with chief engineer Meade Moore, by the end of 1957 Romney had completely phased out the Nash and Hudson brands, whose sales had been lagging. The Rambler brand was selected for development and promotion, as AMC pursued an innovative strategy: manufacturing only compact cars. The company struggled badly at first, losing money in 1956, more in 1957, and experiencing defections from its dealer network. Romney instituted company-wide savings and efficiency measures, and he and other executives reduced their salaries by up to 35 percent. In sticking with his decision to focus on smaller cars, Romney exhibited a stubbornness that was common across several generations of Romneys.

Though AMC was on the verge of being taken over by corporate raider Louis Wolfson in 1957, Romney was able to fend him off. Then sales of the Rambler finally took off, leading to unexpected financial success for AMC. It posted its first quarterly profit in three years in 1958, was the only car company to show increased sales during the recession of 1958, and moved from thirteenth to seventh place among worldwide auto manufacturers.
In contrast with the Hudson&#x27;s NASCAR racing success in the early 1950s, the Ramblers were frequent winners in the coast-to-coast Mobil Economy Run, an annual event on U.S. highways. Sales remained strong during 1960 and 1961; the Rambler was America&#x27;s third most popular car both years.

A believer in &quot;competitive cooperative consumerism&quot;, Romney was effective in his frequent appearances before Congress. He discussed what he saw as the twin evils of &quot;big labor&quot; and &quot;big business&quot;, and called on Congress to break up the Big Three. As the Big Three automakers introduced ever-larger models, AMC undertook a &quot;gas-guzzling dinosaur fighter&quot; strategy, and Romney became the company spokesperson in print advertisements, public appearances, and commercials on the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television program. Known for his fast-paced, short-sleeved management style that ignored organizational charts and levels of responsibility, he often wrote the ad copy himself.

Romney became what automotive writer Joe Sherman termed &quot;a folk hero of the American auto industry&quot; and one of the first high-profile media-savvy business executives. His focus on small cars as a challenge to AMC&#x27;s domestic competitors, as well as the foreign-car invasion, was documented in the April 6, 1959, cover story of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which concluded that &quot;Romney has brought off singlehanded one of the most remarkable selling jobs in U.S. industry.&quot; A full biography of him was published in 1960; the company&#x27;s resurgence made Romney a household name. The Associated Press named Romney its Man of the Year in Industry for four consecutive years, 1958 through 1961.

The company&#x27;s stock rose from $7 per share to $90 per share, making Romney a millionaire from stock options. However, whenever he felt his salary and bonus was excessively high for a year, he gave the excess back to the company. After initial wariness, he developed a good relationship with United Automobile Workers leader Walter Reuther, and AMC workers also benefited from a then-novel profit-sharing plan. Romney was one of only a few Michigan corporate chiefs to support passage and implementation of the state Fair Employment Practices Act.

==Local church and civic leadership==

Religion was a paramount force in Romney&#x27;s life. In a 1959 essay for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; he said, &quot;My religion is my most precious possession. ... Except for my religion, I easily could have become excessively occupied with industry, social and recreational activities. Sharing personal responsibility for church work with my fellow members has been a vital counterbalance in my life.&quot; Following LDS Church practices, he did not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages, smoke, or swear. His favorite piece of Mormon scripture was from Doctrine and Covenants: &quot;Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good.&quot; Romney and his wife tithed, and from 1955 to 1965, gave 19 percent of their income to the church and another 4 percent to charity.

Romney was a high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood of the LDS, and beginning in 1944 he headed the Detroit church branch (which initially was small enough to meet in a member&#x27;s house). By the time he was AMC chief, he presided over the Detroit stake, which included not only all of Metro Detroit, Ann Arbor, and the Toledo area of Ohio but also the western edge of Ontario along the Michigan border. In this role, Romney oversaw the religious work of some 2,700 church members, occasionally preached sermons, and supervised the construction of the first stake tabernacle east of the Mississippi River in 100 years. Because the stake covered part of Canada, he often interacted with Canadian Mission President Thomas S. Monson. Romney&#x27;s rise to a leadership role in the church reflected the church&#x27;s journey from a fringe pioneer religion to one that was closely associated with mainstream American business and values. Due in part to his prominence, the larger Romney family tree would become viewed as &quot;LDS royalty&quot;.

Romney and his family lived in affluent Bloomfield Hills, having moved there from Detroit around 1953. He became deeply active in Michigan civic affairs. He was on the board of directors of the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Michigan and the United Foundation of Detroit, and was chairman of the executive committee of the Detroit Round Table of Catholics, Jews, and Protestants. In 1959, he received the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai&#x27;s Americanism award.

Starting in 1956, Romney headed a citizen-based committee for improved educational programs in Detroit&#x27;s public schools. The 1958, final report of the Citizens Advisory Committee on School Needs was largely Romney&#x27;s work and received considerable public attention; it made nearly 200 recommendations for economy and efficiency, better teacher pay, and new infrastructure funding. Romney helped a $90-million education-related bond issue and tax increase win an upset victory in an April 1959 statewide referendum. He organized Citizens for Michigan in 1959, a nonpartisan group that sought to study Detroit&#x27;s problems and build an informed electorate. Citizens for Michigan built on Romney&#x27;s belief that assorted interest groups held too much influence in government, and that only the cooperation of informed citizens acting for the benefit of all could counter them.

Based on his fame and accomplishments in a state where automobile making was a central topic of conversation, Romney was seen as a natural to enter politics. He first became directly involved in politics in 1959, when he was a key force in the petition drive calling for a constitutional convention to rewrite the Michigan Constitution. Romney&#x27;s sales skills made Citizens for Michigan one of the most effective organizations among those calling for the convention. Previously unaffiliated politically, Romney declared himself a member of the Republican Party and gained election to the convention. By early 1960, many in Michigan&#x27;s somewhat moribund Republican Party were touting Romney as a possible candidate for governor, U.S. senator, or even U.S. vice president.

Also in early 1960, Romney served on the Fair Campaign Practices Committee, a group also having Jewish, Catholic, mainline and evangelical Protestant, and Orthodox Christian members. It issued a report whose guiding principles were that no candidate for elected office should be supported or opposed due to their religion and that no campaign for office should be seen as an opportunity to vote for one religion against another. This statement helped pave the way for John F. Kennedy&#x27;s famous speech on religion and public office later that year. Romney briefly considered a run in the 1960 Senate election, but instead became a vice president of the constitutional convention that revised the Michigan constitution during 1961 and 1962.

==Governor of Michigan==

After a period of pained indecision and a 24-hour prayer fast, Romney stepped down from AMC in February 1962 to enter electoral politics (given an indefinite leave of absence, he was succeeded as president of AMC by Roy Abernethy).
Romney&#x27;s position as the leader of the moderate Republicans at the constitutional convention helped gain him the Republican nomination for governor of Michigan.
He ran against the incumbent Democratic Governor John B. Swainson in the general election. Romney campaigned on revising the state&#x27;s tax structure, increasing its appeal to businesses and the general public, and getting it &quot;rolling again&quot;. Romney decried both the large influence of labor unions within the Democratic Party and the similarly large influence of big business within the Republican Party. His campaign was among the first to exploit the capabilities of electronic data processing.

Romney won by some 80,000 votes and ended a fourteen-year stretch of Democratic rule in the state executive spot. His win was attributed to his appeal to independent voters and to those from the increasingly influential suburbs of Detroit, who by 1962 were more likely to vote Republican than the heavily Democratic residents of the city itself. Additionally, Romney had found a level of support among labor union members that was unusual for a Republican. Democrats won all the other statewide executive offices in the election, including Democratic incumbent T. John Lesinski in the separate election for lieutenant governor of Michigan. Romney&#x27;s success caused immediate mention of him as a presidential possibility for 1964, and President John F. Kennedy said privately in 1963 that, &quot;The one fellow I don&#x27;t want to run against is Romney.&quot;

Romney was sworn in as governor on January 1, 1963. His initial concern was the implementation of the overhaul of the state&#x27;s financial and revenue structure that had been authorized by the constitutional convention. In 1963, he proposed a comprehensive tax revision package that included a flat-rate state income tax, but general economic prosperity alleviated pressure on the state budget and the Michigan Legislature rejected the measure. Romney&#x27;s early difficulties with the legislature helped undermine an attempted push that year of Romney as a national political figure by former Richard Nixon associates. One Michigan Democrat said of Romney, &quot;He has not yet learned that things in government are not necessarily done the moment the man at the top gives an order. He is eager and sometimes impatient.&quot; But over his first two years in office, Romney was able to work with Democrats – who often had at least partial control of the legislature – and an informal bipartisan coalition formed which allowed Romney to accomplish many of his goals and initiatives.

Romney held a series of Governor&#x27;s Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public services professionals and community activists who attended. He opened his office in the Michigan State Capitol to visitors, spending five minutes with every citizen who wanted to speak with him on Thursday mornings, and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol. He almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday, the Mormon Sabbath. His blunt and unequivocal manner sometimes caused friction, and family members and associates used the idiom &quot;bull in a china shop&quot; to describe him. He took a theatrical approach to governance, staging sudden appearances in settings where he might be politically unwelcome. One former aide later said that &quot;willful&quot; was too weak a word to describe him, and chose &quot;messianic&quot; instead. Romney saw a moral dimension in every issue and his political views were held with as much fervor as religious ones; writer Theodore H. White said &quot;the first quality that surfaced, as one met and talked with George Romney over a number of years, was a sincerity so profound that, in conversation, one was almost embarrassed.&quot;

Romney supported the American Civil Rights Movement while governor. Although he belonged to a church that did not allow black people in its lay clergy, Romney&#x27;s hardscrabble background and subsequent life experiences led him to support the movement. He reflected, &quot;It was only after I got to Detroit that I got to know Negroes and began to be able to evaluate them and I began to recognize that some Negroes are better and more capable than lots of whites.&quot; During his first State of the State address in January 1963, Romney declared that &quot;Michigan&#x27;s most urgent human rights problem is racial discrimination—in housing, public accommodations, education, administration of justice, and employment.&quot; Romney helped create the state&#x27;s first civil rights commission.
When Martin Luther King Jr. came to Detroit in June 1963 and led the 120,000-strong Great March on Detroit, Romney designated the occasion Freedom March Day in Michigan, and sent state senator Stanley Thayer to march with King as his emissary, but did not attend himself because it was on Sunday. Romney did participate in a much smaller march protesting housing discrimination the following Saturday in Grosse Pointe, after King had left.

Romney supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964 then under consideration by Congress, and his support for it and advocacy of civil rights, in general, brought him criticism from some in his own church. In January 1964, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles member Delbert L. Stapley wrote him that a proposed civil rights bill was &quot;vicious legislation&quot; and told him that &quot;the Lord had placed the curse upon the Negro&quot; and men should not seek its removal. Romney refused to change his position and increased his efforts towards civil rights. Regarding the church policy itself, Romney was among those liberal Mormons who hoped the church leadership would revise the theological interpretation that underlay it, but Romney did not believe in publicly criticizing the church, subsequently saying that fellow Mormon Stewart Udall&#x27;s 1967 published denunciation of the policy &quot;cannot serve any useful religious purpose&quot;.
In the 1964 U.S. presidential election, Senator Barry Goldwater quickly became the likely Republican Party nominee. Goldwater represented a new wave of American conservatism, of which the moderate Romney was not a part. Romney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in all the other races that year, including Romney&#x27;s own (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor). Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater&#x27;s views on civil rights; he would later say, &quot;Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, have &quot;got&quot; to learn to know each other. Barry Goldwater didn&#x27;t have any background to understand this, to fathom them, and I couldn&#x27;t get through to him.&quot; Romney declared at a dinner held in his honor at Salt Lake City that by appealing to the Southerners who supported racial segregation in order to win the presidency, the Republican Party would forever lose its association as the party of Abraham Lincoln.

During the June 1964 National Governors&#x27; Conference, 13 of 16 Republican governors present were opposed to Goldwater; their leaders were Jim Rhodes of Ohio, Nelson Rockefeller of New York (whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary), William Scranton of Pennsylvania, and Romney. In an unusual appearance at a Sunday press conference, Romney declared that the nomination of Goldwater could lead to the &quot;suicidal destruction of the Republican Party&quot;, and that &quot;If [Goldwater&#x27;s] views deviate as indicated from the heritage of our party, I will do everything within my power to keep him from becoming the party&#x27;s presidential nominee.&quot; Romney had, however, previously vowed to Michigan voters that he would not run for president in 1964. Detroit newspapers indicated they would not support him in any such bid, and Romney quickly decided to honor his pledge to stay out of the contest. Scranton entered instead, but Goldwater prevailed decisively at the 1964 Republican National Convention. Romney&#x27;s name was entered into nomination as a favorite son by U.S. Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan (who had not wanted to choose between candidates during the primary campaign) and he received the votes of 41 delegates in the roll call (40 of Michigan&#x27;s 48 and one from Kansas).
At the convention, Romney fought for a strengthened civil rights plank in the party platform that would pledge action to eliminate discrimination at the state, local, and private levels, but it was defeated on a voice vote. He also failed to win support for a statement that condemned both left- and right-wing extremism without naming any organizations, which lost a standing vote by a two-to-one margin. Both of Romney&#x27;s positions were endorsed by former President Dwight Eisenhower, who had an approach to civic responsibilities similar to Romney&#x27;s. As the convention concluded, Romney neither endorsed nor repudiated Goldwater and vice presidential nominee William E. Miller, saying he had reservations about Goldwater&#x27;s lack of support for civil rights and the political extremism that Goldwater embodied.

For the fall 1964 elections, Romney cut himself off from the national ticket, refusing to even appear on the same stage with them and continuing to feud with Goldwater privately. He campaigned for governor in mostly Democratic areas, and when pressed at campaign appearances about whether he supported Goldwater, he replied, &quot;You know darn well I&#x27;m not!&quot; Romney was re-elected in 1964 by a margin of over 380,000 votes over Democratic Congressman Neil Staebler, despite Goldwater&#x27;s landslide defeat to President Lyndon B. Johnson that swept away many other Republican candidates. Romney won 15 percent of Michigan&#x27;s black vote, compared to Goldwater&#x27;s two percent.

In 1965, Romney visited South Vietnam for 31 days and said that he was continuing his strong support for U.S. military involvement there.
During 1966, while son Mitt was away in France on missionary work, George Romney guided Mitt&#x27;s fiancée Ann Davies in her conversion to Mormonism. Governor Romney continued his support of civil rights; after violence broke out during the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965, he marched at the front of a Detroit parade in solidarity with the marchers. In 1966, Romney had his biggest electoral success, winning re-election again by some 527,000 votes over Democratic lawyer Zolton Ferency (this time to a four-year term, after a change in Michigan law). His share of the black vote rose to over 30 percent, a virtually unprecedented accomplishment for a Republican.

By 1967, a looming deficit prompted the legislature to overhaul Michigan&#x27;s tax structure. Personal and corporate state income taxes were created while business receipts and corporation franchise taxes were eliminated. Passage of an income levy had eluded past Michigan governors, no matter which party controlled of the legislature. Romney&#x27;s success convincing Democratic and Republican factions to compromise on the details of the measure was considered a key test of his political ability.

The massive 12th Street riot in Detroit began during the predawn hours of July 23, 1967, precipitated by a police raid of a speakeasy in a predominantly black neighborhood. As the day wore on and looting and fires got worse, Romney called in the Michigan State Police and the Michigan National Guard. At 3 a.m. on July 24, Romney and Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanagh called U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark and requested that federal troops be sent. Clark indicated that to do so, Romney would have to declare a state of civil insurrection, which the governor was loath to do from fear that insurance companies would seize upon it as a reason to not cover losses owing to the riot. Elements of the 82nd and 101st U.S. Army Airborne Divisions were mobilized outside of the city.
As the situation in Detroit worsened, Romney told Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, &quot;We gotta move, man, we gotta move.&quot; Near midnight on July 24, President Johnson authorized thousands of paratroopers to enter Detroit. Johnson went on national television to announce his actions and made seven references to Romney&#x27;s inability to control the riot using state and local forces. Thousands of arrests took place and the rioting continued until July 27. The final toll was the largest of any American civil disturbance in fifty years: forty-three dead, over a thousand injured, 2,500 stores looted, hundreds of homes burned, and some $50 million overall in property damage.

There were strong political implications in the handling of the riot, as Romney was seen as a leading Republican contender to challenge Johnson&#x27;s presidential re-election the following year; Romney believed the White House had intentionally slowed its response and he charged Johnson with having &quot;played politics&quot; in his actions. The riot notwithstanding, by the end of Romney&#x27;s governorship the state had made strong gains in civil rights related to public employment, government contracting, and access to public accommodations. Lesser improvements were made in combating discrimination in private employment, housing, education, and law enforcement. Considerable state and federal efforts were made during this time to improve the situation of Michigan&#x27;s migrant farm workers and Native Americans, without much progress for either.

Of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, Romney said it was &quot;a great national tragedy at a time when we need aggressive nonviolent leadership to peacefully achieve equal rights, equal opportunities and equal responsibilities for all. This is indeed a cause for general mourning and rededicated effort by everyone to eliminate racial prejudice in all of its ugly and repressive forms.&quot; The King assassination riots affected many cities across the United States over the next few days. There was some rioting in Detroit and Romney ordered the National Guard deployed and imposed a curfew; but the situation was calmer there than in the worst-affected cities and much less violent than the 1967 riots had been. Romney and his wife Lenore attended the funeral of King on April 9.

Romney greatly expanded the size of state government while governor. His first state budget, for fiscal year 1963, was $550 million, a $20 million increase over that of his predecessor Swainson. Romney had also inherited an $85 million budget deficit, but left office with a surplus. In the following fiscal years, the state budget increased to $684 million for 1964, $820 million for 1965, $1 billion for 1966, $1.1 billion for 1967, and was proposed as $1.3 billion for 1968. Romney led the way for a large increase in state spending on education, and Michigan began to develop one of the nation&#x27;s most comprehensive systems of higher education. There was a significant increase in funding support for local governments and there were generous benefits for the poor and unemployed. Romney&#x27;s spending was enabled by the post–World War II economic expansion that generated continued government surpluses and by a consensus of both parties in Michigan to maintain extensive state bureaucracies and expand public sector services. During his time as governor, Romney also signed the Public Employment Relations Act, which granted collective bargaining rights for public sector employees, reduced strike-related penalties to public employees, and prevented agencies from engaging in unfair practices against unions. It was one of the first state laws in the country that obligated governmental entities to negotiate with public employee unions.

The bipartisan coalitions that Romney worked with in the state legislature enabled him to reach most of his legislative goals. His record as governor continued his reputation for having, as White said, &quot;a knack for getting things done&quot;. Noted University of Michigan historian Sidney Fine assessed him as &quot;a highly successful governor&quot;.

==1968 presidential campaign==

Romney&#x27;s wide margin of re-election as governor in November 1966 thrust him to the forefront of national Republicans. In addition to his political record, the tall, square-jawed, handsome, graying Romney matched what the public thought a president should look like. His voice, with its reverbating cadences and Midwestern accent, was also an asset. Republican governors were determined not to let a Goldwater-sized loss recur, and neither Rockefeller nor Scranton wanted to run again; the governors quickly settled on Romney as their favorite for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1968 U.S. presidential election.
Former Congressman and Republican National Committee chair Leonard W. Hall became Romney&#x27;s informal campaign manager. A Gallup Poll after the November elections showed Romney as favored among Republicans over former Vice President Richard Nixon for the Republican nomination, 39 percent to 31 percent; a Harris Poll showed Romney besting President Johnson among all voters by 54 percent to 46 percent. Nixon considered Romney his chief opponent. Romney announced an exploratory phase for a possible campaign in February 1967, beginning with a visit to Alaska and the Rocky Mountain states.

Romney&#x27;s greatest weakness was a lack of foreign policy expertise and a need for a clear position on the Vietnam War. The press coverage of the trip focused on Vietnam, and reporters were frustrated by Romney&#x27;s initial reluctance to speak about it. The qualities that helped Romney as an industry executive worked against him as a presidential candidate; he had difficulty being articulate, often speaking at length and too forthrightly on a topic and then later correcting himself while maintaining he was not changing what he had said. Reporter Jack Germond joked that he was going to add a single key on his typewriter that would print, &quot;Romney later explained ...&quot; &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote that Romney &quot;manages to turn self-expression into a positive ordeal&quot; and that he was no different in private: &quot;nobody can sound more like the public George Romney than the real George Romney let loose to ramble, inevitably away from the point and toward some distant moral precept.&quot; Romney had the image of a do-gooder and reporters began to refer to him as &quot;Saint George&quot;.

The perception grew that Romney was gaffe-prone. The campaign, beset by internal rivalries, soon went through the first of several reorganizations. By then, Nixon had already overtaken Romney in Gallup&#x27;s Republican preference poll, a lead he would hold throughout the rest of the campaign. The techniques that had brought Romney victories in Michigan, such as operating outside established partisan formulas and keeping a distance from Republican Party organizational elements, proved ineffective in a party nominating contest.
Romney&#x27;s national poll ratings continued to erode, and by May he had lost his edge over Johnson. The Detroit riots of July 1967 did not change his standing among Republicans, but did give him a bounce in national polls against the increasingly unpopular president.

Questions were occasionally asked about Romney&#x27;s eligibility to run for U.S. president owing to his birth in Mexico, given the ambiguity in the United States Constitution over the phrase &quot;natural-born citizen&quot;. Romney would depart the race before the matter could be more definitively resolved, although the preponderance of opinion then and since has been that he was eligible.

Romney was also the first Mormon to stage a credible run for the presidency. By this time, he was well known as a Mormon, especially through profiles in national magazines dating back to his years in business. Indeed, he was perhaps the most nationally visible Mormon since Brigham Young. However, his membership in the LDS Church was not heavily mentioned during the campaign. What indirect discussion there was helped bring to national attention the church&#x27;s policy regarding blacks, but the contrast of Romney&#x27;s pro-civil rights stance deflected any criticism of him and indirectly benefited the image of the church. Some historians and Mormons suspected then and later that had Romney&#x27;s campaign lasted longer and been more successful, his religion might have become a more prominent issue. Romney&#x27;s campaign did often focus on his core beliefs; a Romney billboard in New Hampshire read &quot;The Way To Stop Crime Is To Stop Moral Decay&quot;. Dartmouth College students gave a bemused reaction to his morals message, displaying signs such as &quot;God Is Alive and Thinks He&#x27;s George Romney&quot;. A spate of books were published about Romney, more than for any other candidate, and included a friendly campaign biography, an attack from a former staffer, and a collection of Romney&#x27;s speeches.

On August 31, 1967, in a taped interview with locally influential (and nationally syndicated) talk show host Lou Gordon of WKBD-TV in Detroit, Romney stated: &quot;When I came back from Viet Nam [in November 1965], I&#x27;d just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get.&quot; He then shifted to opposing the war: &quot;I no longer believe that it was necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia.&quot; Decrying the &quot;tragic&quot; conflict, he urged &quot;a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time&quot;. Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was &quot;morally right and necessary&quot;.

The &quot;brainwashing&quot; reference had been an offhand, unplanned remark that came at the end of a long, behind-schedule day of campaigning. By September 7, it found its way into prominence at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Eight other governors who had been on the same 1965 trip as Romney said no such activity had taken place, and one of them, Philip H. Hoff of Vermont, said Romney&#x27;s remarks were &quot;outrageous, kind of stinking ... Either he&#x27;s a most naïve man or he lacks judgment.&quot; The overtones of brainwashing, following the experiences of American prisoners of war (highlighted by the 1962 film &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;), made Romney&#x27;s comment devastating, especially as it reinforced the negative image of Romney&#x27;s abilities that had already developed. The topic of brainwashing quickly became the subject of critical newspaper editorials, as well as television talk show fodder, and Romney bore the brunt of the topical humor. Senator Eugene McCarthy, running against Johnson for the Democratic nomination, said that in Romney&#x27;s case, &quot;a light rinse would have been sufficient.&quot; Republican Congressman Robert T. Stafford of Vermont sounded a common concern: &quot;If you&#x27;re running for the presidency, you are supposed to have too much on the ball to be brainwashed.&quot; After the remark was aired, Romney&#x27;s poll ratings nosedived, going from 11 percent behind Nixon to 26 percent behind.

He nonetheless persevered, staging a three-week, 17-city tour of the nation&#x27;s ghettos and disadvantaged areas that none of his advisors thought politically worthwhile. He sought to engage militants in dialogue, found himself exposed to the harsh realities and language of ghetto areas, and had an unusual encounter with hippies and the Diggers in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury.

Romney formally announced on November 18, 1967, at Detroit&#x27;s Veterans Memorial Building, that he had &quot;decided to fight for and win the Republican nomination and election to the Presidency of the United States&quot;. His subsequent release of his federal tax returns – twelve years&#x27; worth going back to his time as AMC head – was groundbreaking and established a precedent that many future presidential candidates would have to contend with. He spent the following months campaigning tirelessly, focusing on the New Hampshire primary, the first of the season, and doing all the on-the-ground activities known to that state: greeting workers at factory gates before dawn, having neighborhood meetings in private homes, and stopping at bowling alleys. He returned to Vietnam in December 1967 and made speeches and proposals on the subject, one of which presaged Nixon&#x27;s eventual policy of Vietnamization. For a while, he got an improved response from voters.
Two weeks before the March 12 primary, an internal poll showed Romney losing to Nixon by a six-to-one margin in New Hampshire. Rockefeller, seeing the poll result as well, publicly maintained his support for Romney but said he would be available for a draft; the statement made national headlines and embittered Romney (who would later claim it was Rockefeller&#x27;s entry, and not the &quot;brainwashing&quot; remark, that doomed him). Seeing his cause was hopeless, Romney announced his withdrawal as a presidential candidate on February 28, 1968. Romney wrote his son Mitt, still away on missionary work: &quot;Your mother and I are not personally distressed. As a matter of fact, we are relieved. ... I aspired, and though I achieved not, I am satisfied.&quot;

Nixon went on to gain the nomination. At the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Romney refused to release his delegates to Nixon, something Nixon did not forget. Romney finished a weak fifth, with only 50 votes on the roll call (44 of Michigan&#x27;s 48, plus six of Utah&#x27;s eight). When party liberals and moderates and others expressed dismay at Nixon&#x27;s choice of Spiro Agnew as his running mate, Romney&#x27;s name was placed into nomination for vice president by Mayor of New York John Lindsay and pushed by several delegations. Romney said he did not initiate the move, but he made no effort to oppose it. Nixon saw the rebellion as a threat to his leadership and actively fought against it; Romney lost to Agnew 1,119–186. Romney, however, worked for Nixon&#x27;s eventually successful campaign in the fall, which did earn him Nixon&#x27;s gratitude.

Presidential historian Theodore H. White wrote that during his campaign Romney gave &quot;the impression of an honest and decent man simply not cut out to be President of the United States&quot;. Governor Rhodes more memorably said, &quot;Watching George Romney run for the presidency was like watching a duck try to make love to a football.&quot;

==Secretary of Housing and Urban Development==

After the election, Nixon named Romney to be secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The president-elect made the announcement as part of a nationally televised presentation of his new cabinet on December 11, 1968. Nixon praised Romney for his &quot;missionary zeal&quot; and said that he would also be tasked with mobilizing volunteer organizations to fight poverty and disease within the United States. In actuality, Nixon distrusted Romney politically, and appointed him to a liberally oriented, low-profile federal agency partly to appease Republican moderates and partly to reduce Romney&#x27;s potential to challenge for the 1972 Republican presidential nomination.

Romney was confirmed by the Senate without opposition on January 20, 1969, the day of Nixon&#x27;s inauguration, and was sworn into office on January 22, with Nixon at his side. Romney resigned as governor that same day, and was succeeded by his lieutenant governor, William G. Milliken. Milliken continued Romney&#x27;s model of downplaying party label and ideology, and Republicans held onto the governorship for three more terms until 1983, though Michigan was one of the nation&#x27;s most blue-collar states.

As secretary, Romney conducted the first reorganization of the department since its 1966 creation. The changes were intended to make the department more business-like with fewer independent bureaucracies. His November 1969, plan brought programs with similar functions together under unified, policy-based administration at the Washington level, and created two new assistant secretary positions. At the same time, he increased the number of regional and area offices and decentralized program operations and locality-based decisions to them, moves that were in keeping with Nixon&#x27;s &quot;New Federalism&quot;. In particular, the Federal Housing Administration underwent wholesale changes to make it less autonomous. During his tenure, Romney believed his reorganization made the department more efficient and able to withstand some, but not all, of the budget cuts that Nixon imposed on it.

The Fair Housing Act of 1968 mandated a federal commitment towards housing desegregation, and required HUD to orient its programs in this direction. Romney, filled with moral passion, wanted to address the widening economic and geographic gulf between whites and blacks by moving blacks out of inner-city ghettos into suburbs. Romney proposed an open housing scheme to facilitate desegregation, dubbed &quot;Open Communities&quot;; HUD planned it for many months without keeping Nixon informed.
When the open housing proposal became public, local reaction was often hostile. Such was the reaction of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, many of whom were ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. Now the secretary said, &quot;The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for &#x27;nature to take its course.&#x27; What is really at issue here is responsibility – moral responsibility.&quot;

Romney visited Warren in July 1970, where he addressed leaders from it and around 40 nearby suburbs. He emphasized that the government was encouraging affirmative action rather than forced integration, but the local populace saw little difference and Romney was jostled and jeered as a police escort took him away from the meeting place. Nixon saw what happened in Warren and had no interest in the Open Communities policy in general, remarking to domestic adviser John Ehrlichman that, &quot;This country is not ready at this time for either forcibly integrated housing or forcibly integrated education.&quot; The Open Communities policy conflicted with Nixon&#x27;s purported use of the Southern strategy of gaining political support among traditionally white southern Democrats, and his own views on race. Romney was forced to back down on Warren and release federal monies to them unconditionally.

When Black Jack, Missouri, subsequently resisted a HUD-sponsored plan for desegregated lower- and middle-income housing, Romney appealed to U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell for Justice Department intervention. In September 1970, Mitchell refused and Romney&#x27;s plan collapsed. Under Romney, HUD did establish stricter affirmative racial guidelines in relation to new public housing projects, but overall administration implementation of the Fair Housing Act was lacking. Some of the responsibility lay with Romney&#x27;s inattentiveness to gaining political backing for the policy, including the failure to rally natural allies such as the NAACP. Salisbury University historian Dean J. Kotlowski writes that, &quot;No civil rights initiative developed on Nixon&#x27;s watch was as sincerely devised or poorly executed as open communities.&quot;

Another of Romney&#x27;s initiatives was &quot;Operation Breakthrough&quot;, launched in June 1969. It was intended to increase the amount of housing available to the poor and it initially had Nixon&#x27;s support. Based on his automotive industry experience, Romney thought that the cost of housing could be significantly reduced if in-factory modular construction techniques were used, despite the lack of national building standards. HUD officials believed that the introduction of this technique could help bring about desegregation; Romney said, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to put an end to the idea of moving to suburban areas and living only among people of the same economic and social class&quot;. This aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well. Over half of HUD&#x27;s research funds during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough, and it was modestly successful in its building goals. It did not revolutionize home construction, and was phased out once Romney left HUD. But it resulted indirectly in more modern and consistent building codes and introduction of technological advances such as the smoke alarm.

In any case, using conventional construction methods, HUD set records for the amount of construction of assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families. Toward the end of his term, Romney oversaw the demolition of the infamous Pruitt–Igoe housing project in St. Louis, which had become crime-ridden, drug-infested, and largely vacant.
Romney was largely outside the president&#x27;s inner circle and had minimal influence within the Nixon administration. His intense, sometimes bombastic style of making bold advances and awkward pullbacks lacked adequate guile to succeed in Washington. Desegregation efforts in employment and education had more success than in housing during the Nixon administration, but HUD&#x27;s many missions and unwieldy structure, which sometimes worked at cross-purposes, made it institutionally vulnerable to political attack. Romney also failed to understand or circumvent Nixon&#x27;s use of counsel Ehrlichman and White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman as policy gatekeepers, resulting in &quot;de facto&quot; downgrading of the power of cabinet officers. Romney was used to being listened to and making his own decisions; he annoyed Nixon by casually interrupting him at meetings. At one point, Nixon told Haldeman, &quot;Just keep [Romney] away from me.&quot; A statement by Romney that he would voluntarily reduce his salary to aid the federal budget was viewed by Nixon as an &quot;ineffective grandstand play&quot;.

By early 1970, Nixon had decided he wanted Romney removed from his position. Nixon, who hated to fire people and was, as Ehrlichman later described, &quot;notoriously inadept&quot; at it, instead hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the 1970 U.S. Senate race in Michigan. Instead, Romney proposed that his wife Lenore run, and she received the backing of some state Republicans. There was also resistance to her candidacy and an initial suspicion that it was just a stalking horse for keeping his options open. She barely survived a primary against a conservative opponent, then lost badly in the general election to incumbent Democrat Philip A. Hart. Romney blamed others for his wife having entered the race, when he had been the major force behind it.

In late 1970, after opposition to Open Communities reached a peak, Nixon again decided that Romney should go. Still reluctant to dismiss him, Nixon tried to get Romney to resign by forcing him to capitulate on a series of policy issues. Romney surprised both Nixon and Haldeman by agreeing to back off his positions, and Nixon kept him as HUD secretary. Nixon remarked privately afterwards, &quot;[Romney] talks big but folds under pressure.&quot; Puzzled by Nixon&#x27;s lack of apparent ideological consistency across different areas of the government, Romney told a friend, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the president believes in. Maybe he doesn&#x27;t believe in anything&quot;, an assessment shared by others both inside and outside the administration. For his work as Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development, in March 1972 Romney was awarded the Republican of the Year Award by the centrist Republican organization Ripon Society.
In spring 1972, the FHA was struck by scandal. Since the passage of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 and the creation of the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), it had been responsible for helping the poor buy homes in inner-city areas via government-backed mortgages. These were financed by mortgage-backed securities, the first issues of which Romney had announced in 1970. A number of FHA employees, along with a number of real estate firms and lawyers, were indicted for a scheme in which the value of cheap inner-city homes was inflated and they were sold to black buyers who could not really afford them, based on using those government-backed mortgages. The government was stuck for the bad loans when owners defaulted, as the properties were overvalued and could not be resold at inflated prices. Assessments of the overall cost of the scandal were as high as $2 billion. Romney conceded that HUD had been unprepared to deal with speculators and had not been alert to earlier signs of illegal activity at the FHA. The FHA scandal gave Nixon the ability to shut down HUD&#x27;s remaining desegregation efforts with little political risk; by January 1973, all federal housing funds had been frozen.

In August 1972, Nixon announced Romney would inspect Hurricane Agnes flood damage in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, but neglected to tell Romney first. Much of the area lacked shelter six weeks after the storm, residents were angry, and Romney got into a three-way shouting match with Governor Milton J. Shapp and a local citizens&#x27; representative. Romney denounced Shapp&#x27;s proposal that the federal government pay off the mortgages of victims as &quot;unrealistic and demagogic&quot;, and the representative angrily said to Romney, &quot;You don&#x27;t give a damn whether we live or die.&quot; The confrontation received wide media attention, damaging Romney&#x27;s public reputation. Feeling very frustrated, Romney wanted to resign immediately, but Nixon, worried about the fallout to his 1972 re-election campaign among moderate Republican voters, insisted that Romney stay on. Romney agreed, although he indicated to the press that he would leave eventually.

Romney finally turned in his resignation on November 9, 1972, following Nixon&#x27;s re-election. His departure was announced on November 27, 1972, as part of the initial wave of departures from Nixon&#x27;s first-term cabinet. Romney said he was unhappy with presidential candidates who declined to address &quot;the real issues&quot; facing the nation for fear they would lose votes, and said he would form a new national citizens&#x27; organization that would attempt to enlighten the public on the most vital topics. He added that he would stay on as secretary until his successor could be appointed and confirmed, and did stay until Nixon&#x27;s second inauguration on January 20, 1973. Upon his departure, Romney said he looked forward &quot;with great enthusiasm&quot; to his return to private life. Romney later said of Nixon: &quot;He was a crook, but he was no dummy.&quot;

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; later termed Romney&#x27;s conflicts with Nixon a matter that &quot;played out with Shakespearean drama&quot;. Despite all the setbacks and frustrations, University at Buffalo political scientist Charles M. Lamb concludes that Romney pressed harder to achieve suburban integration than any prominent federal official in the ensuing 1970s through the 1990s. Lehman College sociology professor Christopher Bonastia assesses the Romney-era HUD as having come &quot;surprisingly close to implementing unpopular antidiscrimination policies&quot; but finally being unable to produce meaningful alterations in American residential segregation patterns, with no equivalent effort having happened since then or likely to in the foreseeable future. In contrast, Illinois State University historian Roger Biles has termed Romney&#x27;s tenure as secretary &quot;disastrous&quot; while allowing that none of the secretaries who followed him have done any better.

==Public service, volunteerism, and final years==
Romney was known as an advocate of public service, and volunteerism was a passion of his. He initiated several volunteer programs while governor, and at the beginning of the Nixon administration chaired the Cabinet Committee on Voluntary Action. Out of this the National Center for Voluntary Action was created: an independent, private, non-profit organization intended to encourage volunteerism on the part of American citizens and organizations, to assist in program development for voluntary efforts, and to make voluntary action an important force in American society. Romney&#x27;s long interest in volunteerism stemmed from the Mormon belief in the power of institutions to transform the individual, but also had a secular basis. At the National Center&#x27;s first meeting on February 20, 1970, he said:

Americans have four basic ways of solving problems that are too big for individuals to handle by themselves. One is through the federal government. A second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create. The third is through the private sector – the economic sector that includes business, agriculture, and labor. The fourth method is the independent sector – the voluntary, cooperative action of free individuals and independent association. Voluntary action is the most powerful of these, because it is uniquely capable of stirring the people themselves and involving their enthusiastic energies, because it is their own – voluntary action is the people&#x27;s action. ... As Woodrow Wilson said, &quot;The most powerful force on earth is the spontaneous cooperation of a free people.&quot; Individualism makes cooperation worthwhile – but cooperation makes freedom possible.

In 1973, after he left the cabinet, Romney became chair and CEO of the National Center for Voluntary Action. In 1979, this organization merged with the Colorado-based National Information Center on Volunteerism and became known as ; Romney headed the new organization. The organization simplified its name to VOLUNTEER: The National Center in 1984 and to the National Volunteer Center in 1990. Romney remained as chair of these organizations throughout this time. Nonetheless, the transaction away from being a significant figure in the political world was difficult for him and led to several years where he felt dispirited.

Within the LDS Church, Romney remained active and prominent, serving as patriarch of the Bloomfield Hills stake and holding the office of regional representative of the Twelve, covering Michigan and northern Ohio. He joined the Church in opposing the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, claiming in 1979 that it was intended to support &quot;perverted and improper sexual conduct.&quot; During the early part of the Reagan administration, Romney served on the President&#x27;s Task Force for Private Sector Initiatives along with LDS leader Monson. As part of a longtime habit of playing golf daily, he had long ago concocted a &quot;compact 18&quot; format in which he played three balls on each of six holes, or similar formulations depending upon the amount of daylight. In 1987, he held a four-generation extended family reunion in Washington, where he showed the places and recounted the events of his life which had occurred there. Looking back on his and some other failed presidential bids, he once concluded, &quot;You can&#x27;t be right too soon and win elections.&quot;

President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s Points of Light Foundation was created in 1990, also to encourage volunteerism. Romney received the Points of Light Foundation&#x27;s inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award from President Bush in April 1991. The Bush administration wanted to tap Romney to chair the new foundation, but he reportedly refused to head two organizations doing the same thing and suggested they merge. They did so in September 1991, and Romney became one of the founding directors of the Points of Light Foundation &amp; Volunteer Center National Network.
In the early 1990s, Romney was also involved in helping to set up the Commission on National and Community Service, one of the predecessors to the later Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). He gave speeches emphasizing the vital role of people helping people, and in 1993 inspired the first national meeting of volunteer centers.

For much of his final two decades, Romney had been out of the political eye, and but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney&#x27;s bid to unseat Senator Ted Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son&#x27;s house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events, which on the whole benefited the campaign. When Kennedy&#x27;s campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church&#x27;s past policy on blacks, Romney interrupted Mitt&#x27;s press conference and said loudly, &quot;I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture.&quot; The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.

That same year, Ronna Romney, Romney&#x27;s ex-daughter-in-law (formerly married to G. Scott Romney), decided to seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate from Michigan. While Mitt and G. Scott endorsed Ronna Romney, George Romney had endorsed her opponent and the eventual winner, Spencer Abraham, during the previous year when Ronna was considering a run but had not yet announced. A family spokesperson said that George Romney had endorsed Abraham before knowing Ronna Romney would run and could not go back on his word, although he did refrain from personally campaigning on Abraham&#x27;s behalf.

By January 1995, amid press criticism of the Points of Light Foundation engaging in ineffective, wasteful spending, Romney expressed concern that the organization had too high a budget. Active to the end, in July 1995, four days before his death, Romney proposed a presidential summit to encourage greater volunteerism and community service, and the night before his death he drove to a meeting of another volunteer organization.

On July 26, 1995, Romney died of a heart attack at the age of 88 while he was doing his morning exercising on a treadmill at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan; he was discovered by his wife Lenore but it was too late to save him. He was buried at the Fairview Cemetery in Brighton, Michigan. In addition to his wife and children, Romney was survived by 23 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.

==Legacy==
The Presidents&#x27; Summit For America&#x27;s Future took place in Philadelphia in 1997, manifesting Romney&#x27;s last volunteerism proposal, with the organization America&#x27;s Promise coming out of it. For many years, the Points of Light Foundation (and its predecessor organization) has given out an annual Lenore and George W. Romney Citizen Volunteer Award (later retitled the George and Lenore Romney Citizen Volunteer Award); the inaugural award in 1987 went to George Romney himself. The Points of Light Foundation and the CNCS also give out a George W. Romney Volunteer Center Excellence Award (later the George W. Romney Excellence Award) at the annual National Conference on Community Volunteering and National Service (later the National Conference on Volunteering and Service). The George W. Romney Volunteer Center itself is sponsored by the United Way for Southeastern Michigan, and began during Romney&#x27;s lifetime.

The Automotive Hall of Fame of Dearborn, Michigan honored Romney with its Distinguished Service Citation award in 1956. He was then inducted into the hall of fame itself in 1995.

Founded in 1998 with a grant from Romney&#x27;s immediate family, the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management in the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University (BYU) honors the legacy left by Romney. Its mission is to develop people of high character who are committed to service, management, and leadership in the public sector and in non-profit organizations throughout the world.

The building housing the main offices of the governor of Michigan in Lansing is known as the George W. Romney Building following a 1997 renaming. The Governor George Romney Lifetime Achievement Award is given annually by the State of Michigan, to recognize citizens who have demonstrated a commitment to community involvement and volunteer service throughout their lifetimes. In 2010, Adrian College in Michigan announced the opening of its George Romney Institute for Law and Public Policy. Its purpose is to explore the interdisciplinary nature of law and public policy and encourage practitioners, academics, and students to work together on issues in this realm.

On January 4, 2025, president Joe Biden posthumously honored him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, whom his son, Mitt Romney, accepted on his behalf.

<doc id="318678" wikidata="Q2740340" url="?curid=318678" title="Making Your Mind Up">
<text>&quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; is a song by the British pop group Bucks Fizz with music composed by John Danter and lyrics written by Andy Hill. Released in March 1981, it was Bucks Fizz&#x27;s debut single, the group having been formed just two months earlier. It in the Eurovision Song Contest 1981, held in Dublin, winning the contest.

Following its win in the contest, the song reached No. 1 in the UK and several other countries, eventually selling in excess of four million copies. It launched the career of the group, who went on to become one of the biggest selling acts of the 1980s and featured on their debut, self-titled album. From 2004 to 2007 the BBC used the name &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; for their Eurovision selection show in honour of the song.

== Background ==
=== Origins ===
In late 1980, songwriter Andy Hill composed &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; with an eye to entering it into the &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; finals the following year. Working with his then girlfriend, Nichola Martin, a singer and music publisher, she encouraged him to collaborate with musician John Danter, who she could sign up to her publishing company, therefore owning half the rights of the song (Hill was already signed to another publisher). Martin claims that Danter&#x27;s input was minimal, the song being essentially a Hill composition. In October 1980, they set about recording a demo of the song featuring the vocals of Hill, Martin and Mike Nolan, a singer Martin had worked with before. In December, the song was chosen out of 591 submitted entries to be one of the eight songs performed in the contest. Martin then realised she had to quickly assemble a group to perform the song for the contest, based around her and Nolan. With the song already entered under the name Bucks Fizz, Martin and future group manager, Jill Shirley recruited Cheryl Baker, Bobby G and Jay Aston to the line-up, with Martin herself dropping out. The song was alongside another Hill/Danter composition, &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot;, which would be performed by Martin and Hill under the name Gem.

Martin and Shirley secured a recording deal with RCA Records and Hill spent a week at Mayfair Studios in London with the group recording the song and its B-side. Backing vocals on the record were supplied by Alan Carvell, who also went on to be one of two backing singers in the Eurovision performance. The song was co-published by Paper Music, which was a year-old publishing company owned by Billy Lawrie – himself a songwriter and brother of singer Lulu. Choreographer Chrissie Whickham, a former member of dance troupe Hot Gossip, spent two days with the group working on the dance routine.

The lyrics of the song are largely meaningless, although it can be argued that they are about making the decision to commit to a serious relationship.

=== Eurovision ===
On 11 March 1981, Bucks Fizz performed &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; at &quot;&quot;, the national final organised by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to select its song and performer for the of the Eurovision Song Contest. Despite being up against favourites and current chart group Liquid Gold, it won the competition with ease, becoming the for Eurovision.

From this point, the group undertook much promotion of the song around the UK, including an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, whereby the single entered the UK charts at 24. It rose to No.5 the following week. As Martin recalls, RCA records were rather indifferent to the group up until now (even releasing the single without a picture sleeve in the UK), but once it entered the charts highly, their attitudes changed suddenly with them agreeing to release an album before they had even won the Eurovision. The BBC filmed a promotional video for the Eurovision previews as they had done in previous years. The video depicts the group walking around Harrods department store in London. In line with other previous preview videos, the group do not lipsynch any of the words. This video has never been released on any official Bucks Fizz video or DVD release, being usually substituted by the group&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.
On 4 April 1981, the Eurovision Song Contest was held at the RDS Simmonscourt in Dublin hosted by (RTÉ) and broadcast live throughout the continent. Bucks Fizz performed &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; fourteenth on the evening. John Coleman conducted the event&#x27;s live orchestra in its performance. In a close contest throughout the voting procedure with no less than five different songs taking the lead at various stages, &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; managed to secure a victory with 136 points, beating second-placed by a small margin of four.

The song is held in affectionate regard by many Eurovision fans, and is generally considered to be a classic example of a pop song from the Contest. Reaction was less favourable to the group&#x27;s performance of the song, which was considered to be off-key, and led to much criticism that the members were chosen more for their appearance than vocal ability. In addition, the performance is best remembered for the startling moment when the two male members of the group whipped off the skirts of the two girls, only to reveal shorter skirts underneath, a shrewd touch generally considered to have just swung the balance in their favour, and to be a defining moment in the competition&#x27;s history. Member Cheryl Baker has since commented on their poor performance, stating that she sang the song in a higher key to the rest of the group due to nerves. Mike Nolan has said that on the night the microphones got mixed up, with Baker and Jay Aston singing on the lead microphones, which had a higher volume.

=== Aftermath ===
&quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; went to No. 1 in the UK following the victory and remained there for three weeks, becoming one of the best-selling songs of the year. It also saw the group in high demand throughout Europe, with the single hitting No. 1 in many countries and charting in the top ten in Australia. The record eventually sold four million copies worldwide. The single began a run of 20 UK hits for Bucks Fizz and was quickly followed up by the single &quot;Piece of the Action&quot; and the debut album &quot;Bucks Fizz&quot;. At the end of the decade, &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; was No. 47 in the UK top-selling singles of the 1980s. Despite the success of the song, fans of the group do not consider it to be a good representation of their work, while member Cheryl Baker does not rate it as one of their best songs. The song is still well-liked by members of the general public and remains the group&#x27;s best-remembered song. In 2013, BBC Radio 2 listeners voted &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; as the best British Eurovision entry ever.

Bucks Fizz performed their song in the Eurovision twenty-fifth anniversary show &quot;Songs of Europe&quot; held on 22 August 1981 in Mysen. It was succeeded as the British entrant in Eurovision by &quot;One Step Further&quot; by Bardo, who were managed by the same team as Bucks Fizz. As a winner, it was succeeded by &quot;Ein bißchen Frieden&quot;, sung by Germany&#x27;s Nicole. The song title has also given the name to the for the Eurovision Song Contest.

The now famous skirt rip of the dance routine (which was mirrored by Mick Jagger and Tina Turner at 1985&#x27;s Live Aid) has appeared in many contests since that time – most notably as part of &#x27;s Marie N&#x27;s performance of &quot;I Wanna&quot;, which won for Latvia, in 2002.

The song was featured in the British soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; in May 2023 during that year&#x27;s edition of the Eurovision Song Contest which was being hosted in the United Kingdom on behalf of Ukraine. Cheryl Baker guest starred in the episode, which saw her help some of the characters who performed the song on stage at a Eurovision-themed party.

<doc id="318682" wikidata="Q61857" url="?curid=318682" title="Eskimo curlew">
<text>The Eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis), also known as northern curlew, is a species of curlew in the family Scolopacidae. It was one of the most numerous shorebirds in the tundra of western Arctic Canada and Alaska. Thousands of birds were then killed per year in the late 1800s. As there has not been a reliable sighting since 1987 or a confirmed sighting since 1963, the Eskimo curlew is considered Critically Endangered or possibly extinct. The bird is about long and fed mostly on insects and berries.

==Taxonomy==

The Eskimo curlew is one of eight species of curlew, and is classed with them in the genus &quot;Numenius&quot;. It used to be placed in the separate genus &quot;Mesoscolopax&quot;. &quot;Numenius&quot; is classed in the family Scolopacidae. Other species in that family include woodcocks, phalaropes, snipes, and sandpipers. Scolopacidae is a Charadriiform lineage.

The species was described by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1772. The generic name has three possible etymologies. One is that it comes from the Greek &quot;&quot;noumenios&quot;. &quot;Noumenios&quot;&quot; means &quot;of the new moon&quot;, the thin beak of this curlew being compared to a thin crescent moon. A second possibility is that the genus name is derived from the word &quot;numen&quot;, meaning &quot;nod&quot;, and referring to this species head being bent forward and down. The final possibility is that &quot;Numenius&quot; is a Latinized form of the Greek &quot;noumenios&quot;, which was the word Diogenes Laërtius used to refer to a species of curlew. The specific name &quot;borealis&quot; is Latin for &quot;northern&quot;.

This species has many common names. It has been named the prairie pigeon, fute, little curlew, doe-bird, and doughbird. These last two names come from its fatness during early migration south.

==Description==

Eskimo curlews are small curlews, about 30 centimeters in length, weighing approximately 360 g, and having a wingspan of 70 cm. Adults have long dark greyish legs and a long bill curved slightly downward. The upperparts are mottled brown and the underparts are light brown. They show cinnamon wing linings in flight. They are similar in appearance to the Hudsonian whimbrel, the American subspecies of the whimbrel, but smaller in size.

In the field, the only certain way to distinguish the Eskimo curlew is confirmation of its unbarred undersides of the primaries. The call is poorly understood, but includes clear whistling sounds.

The Eskimo curlew forms a species pair with the Asian little curlew (&quot;Numenius minutus)&quot;, but is slightly larger, longer-winged, shorter legged, and warmer in plumage tone than its Asian relative.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Eskimo curlew is a New World bird. Members of this species bred on the tundra of western Arctic Canada and Alaska.

Eskimo curlews migrated to the Pampas of Argentina in the late summer and returned in February. They used to be very rare vagrants to western Europe, but there have been no recent records. In Britain, there are four records, all from the nineteenth century.

A comparison of dates and migratory patterns has led some to conjecture that Eskimo curlews and American golden plover are the shorebirds that attracted the attention of Christopher Columbus to nearby land after 65 days at sea and out of sight of land on his first voyage. In the 1800s, millions of Eskimo curlews followed migration routes from the present Yukon and Northwest Territories, flying east along the northern shore of Canada, then south over the Atlantic Ocean to South America in the winter. When returning to North America, they would fly north through the Great Plains.

==Ecology and behavior==
===Diet===
Eskimo curlews picked up food by sight, as well as feeding by probing. They ate mostly berries while on the fall migration in Canada. During the rest of their migration and on the breeding grounds, they ate insects. Snails and other invertebrates (including the extinct Rocky Mountain locust) also were part of their diet during migration.

===Reproduction===
Nesting probably occurred in June. Nests were in open areas on the ground and are difficult to find. They were made of wisps of dried grass or leaves. The eggs were green with brown splotches.

The specific incubation behavior of this species is unknown. It is not certain which sex if not both incubated, nor what the specific timeline is. These birds evidently did not attack intruders approaching their nests, which provides reason to believe that their nests were far apart from each other.

==Probable extinction==

At one time, the Eskimo curlew may have been one of the most numerous shorebirds in North America, with a population in the millions. As many as 2 million birds per year were killed near the end of the nineteenth century. The last confirmed sightings were in 1962 on Galveston Island, Texas (where it was photographed) and on Barbados in 1963 (where a specimen was collected). There was a reliable report of 23 birds in Texas in 1981, and a few dozen additional unconfirmed reports from scattered locales (the Northwest Territories, Texas, Ontario, Manitoba, Massachusetts, Alaska, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Argentina, Guatemala, Labrador, New Jersey, and North Carolina) between 1964 and 2006. No confirmed record of this species has been reported in South America since 1939. It has been suggested that the species not be treated as extinct until all possible remaining habitats have been surveyed and incidental sightings have ceased, and an assessment of critically endangered (possibly extinct) be adopted in the meantime. Full details on all sightings up to 1986 are included in the online edition of &quot;Eskimo Curlew: A Vanishing Species?&quot;

This species is fully protected in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Hunting has been outlawed since around 1916.

==In popular culture==

The plight of this bird inspired the novel (and subsequent Emmy Award-winning 1972 ABC Afterschool Special) &quot;Last of the Curlews&quot;.

The Esquimaux Curlew appears as plate CCCLVII of Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot;.

<doc id="318684" wikidata="Q2504465" url="?curid=318684" title="World Party">
<text>World Party was a musical group, predominantly the solo project of its sole consistent member, the songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist Karl Wallinger. Wallinger started the band in 1986 in London after leaving the Waterboys. At various times, World Party also featured Guy Chambers, David Catlin-Birch, future Oasis drummer Chris Sharrock, Jeff Trott, Amanda Kramer and John Turnbull.

World Party produced several hit singles during the late 1980s and early 1990s including &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, &quot;Way Down Now&quot;, &quot;Put the Message in the Box&quot; and &quot;Is It Like Today?&quot;. The band also released the original version of &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, written (like virtually all World Party material) by Karl Wallinger but best known due to the 1999 cover version by Robbie Williams, a UK number one hit single.

==Career==

===Pre-World Party===
Wallinger was born in Prestatyn. He received classical music training in piano and oboe as a child at both Eton College and Charterhouse School, before switching his allegiance fully to pop and rock music. Following initial stints in Prestatyn with the short-lived bands Pax and Quasimodo, he moved to London in the late 1970s and entered a five-year &quot;lost period&quot; during which he worked in music publishing, had a stint as musical director of a West End production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, and played in a funk band called The Out. By the end of this period, he&#x27;d also mastered all of the instruments needed for him to become a one-man rock band, as well as the arts of record production and synthesizer programming.

In 1983, Wallinger joined his first notable band, the Waterboys, initially as a keyboard player. Having contributed one organ part to the band&#x27;s debut album, and many more piano and organ parts to the second (&quot;A Pagan Place&quot;) as well as playing on tour, his additional skills made him the perfect ally for Waterboys leader Mike Scott when Scott wished to expand the sound of the band for their third album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;. Wallinger co-produced many of the album tracks, adding assorted synthesizer and sampler arrangements as well as backing vocals, synth bass, percussion, and piano and organ. He also wrote the original music for the opening track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bang the Drum&quot;.

Despite the productivity of the sessions for &quot;This is the Sea&quot;, growing rivalry between Scott and Wallinger led to tensions between the two on the subsequent tour, exacerbated by the fact that Wallinger had been writing his own songs from an early age and saw no opportunity to be able to play and sing them while in The Waterboys, which was entirely dominated by Scott&#x27;s artistic vision. Now armed with his own record contract with the Waterboys&#x27; record label, Ensign, Wallinger left the band at the end of the &quot;This is the Sea&quot; tour in 1985.

=== &quot;Private Revolution&quot; ===
The first World Party album, &quot;Private Revolution&quot;, was recorded in a dilapidated former rectory in Woburn, which Wallinger had moved into after quitting both London and The Waterboys. Inspired by Prince, Wallinger recorded the majority of the instruments (guitars, bass, keyboards, drums, samplers) by himself, as well as singing lead vocals and handling programming and production. There were guest appearances on the record by two Waterboys members, saxophonist Anthony Thistlethwaite and fiddle player Steve Wickham. To create the illusion of a full band, Wallinger credited his own instrumental parts to a variety of imaginary players with whimsical names, including &quot;Millennium Mills&quot;, &quot;Rufus Dove&quot; and &quot;Will Towyn&quot;. During this time, he also worked on Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot;, and she in turn sang backing vocals on the song &quot;Hawaiian Island World&quot; as well as appearing in the promotional video for the album&#x27;s title track.

Wallinger&#x27;s efforts rapidly drew further music business attention. &quot;They&#x27;d heard there was a dumb kid in Woburn writing hits,&quot; Wallinger recalled in 2021. &quot;There was this beauty-parade of visiting managers.&quot; Wallinger signed a management deal with Prince&#x27;s manager Steve Fargnoli: &quot;I was a sucker for Prince. I was like, &quot;Take me to Minneapolis. Take me to your leader.&quot;

&quot;Private Revolution&quot; was released in 1986 and displayed Wallinger&#x27;s eclectic mastery of rock, pop, folk, and funk. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, reached a modest number 42 in the British charts but did much better outside the UK – it reached No. 4 in Australia, No. 21 in New Zealand, and No. 27 in the US, in the process becoming the act&#x27;s only major international hit. &quot;Private Revolution&quot; was also issued as a single, but only charted in the UK (at No. 107).

===Breakthrough and peak years – &quot;Goodbye Jumbo&quot; and &quot;Bang!&quot;===
Relocating to a 32-track studio in London (which he called &quot;Seaview&quot;), Wallinger began work on the second World Party album, &quot;Goodbye Jumbo&quot;. As with &quot;Private Revolution&quot;, he played almost all of the instruments himself. In 2000, recalling his songwriting aims at the time, Wallinger explained &quot;I wanted to personify the world and sing about her. I always thought it would have been great if Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; had been about the planet. Plus, if I stand on top of a mountain Julie Andrews-style, the hills do seem to be alive with the sound of music. You can say whatever you like about eco whatever, but if you fuck up the environment you’re going to die.&quot;

On some of the tracks, Wallinger collaborated with fellow former Waterboy and songwriter Guy Chambers, who had originally joined the project in 1986 for live and studio work. Sessions were lengthy, carried out during the night and fuelled by copious amounts of marijuana, with Chambers later remembering &quot;if you worked with Karl you had to get into his headspace. Everything was very slow and you had to be extremely patient. I was one of Karl’s principal cheerleaders at that point. We laughed a lot and I learned a lot from him, particularly about lyrics, but he was a terrible procrastinator and still is now.&quot; For his part, Wallinger would credit Chambers as being &quot;the pushy guy who would cue me into the corner pocket. I’ve got to thank him for that.&quot;

Released on 24 April 1990, &quot;Goodbye Jumbo&quot; was voted &quot;album of the year&quot; by &quot;Q&quot; magazine and was nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;best alternative music performance&quot; in the US. The album contained the minor UK hit singles &quot;Way Down Now&quot; and &quot;Put the Message in the Box&quot; (the latter going on to be covered by Brian Kennedy on his 1996 album &quot;A Better Man&quot;, and becoming a top 40 hit in the UK and a top 20 hit in Ireland). After the 1991 EP &quot;Thank You World&quot;, World Party recruited former Bootleg Beatles member David Catlin-Birch as guitarist and ex-Icicle Works member Chris Sharrock on drums, with intentions to play more live dates. Instead, Ensign label boss Nigel Grainge cancelled a planned tour support slot with Neil Young in favour of further recording.

Looking back on the events twenty-two years later, Wallinger reflected &quot;nowadays you would tour the fuck out of the Q Award thing, but (Grainge) was like, &quot;No, you can’t go and support Neil Young in America – get back in the studio,&quot; and for me that meant three more years out of sight.&quot; He would consider this to be the decisive moment in the band&#x27;s career which damaged its long-term chances. (&quot;That was it. There was a moment there: door open, door closes.&quot;)

With touring plans shelved, World Party began work on a third album, &quot;Bang!&quot;. During the lengthy recording process, Chambers set up his own band The Lemon Trees in 1992, continuing with them in parallel to his World Party work until 1995.

Released in 1993, &quot;Bang!&quot; reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart, A single, &quot;Is It Like Today?&quot; (described by Wallinger as &quot;a précis of Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot; in four verses&quot;), reached No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart as well as becoming a moderately successful single in Europe. Following the success of &quot;Bang!&quot;, World Party appeared at the Glastonbury Festival in 1994, at which they had previously played in 1987 and 1990. The album generated two further singles, &quot;&#x27;Give It All Away&quot; and &quot;All I Gave&quot;.

In 1994, World Party recorded &quot;When You Come Back to Me&quot; for the &quot;Reality Bites&quot; soundtrack, influenced by David Bowie&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;Young Americans&quot;.

===&quot;Egyptology&quot; (and &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;), &quot;Dumbing Up&quot;, Wallinger&#x27;s aneurysm and hiatus===

Written following the death of Wallinger&#x27;s mother, World Party&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Egyptology&quot;, was released in 1997. A single, &quot;Beautiful Dream&quot;, only reached No. 31 in the British charts; and the album itself was commercially unsuccessful. Wallinger severed ties with his record label, regained his back catalogue in 1998, and began a three-year break.

Wallinger&#x27;s discouragement with being shuffled from label to label (Ensign to Charisma to EMI) due to corporate takeovers had a lot to do with the break and his desire for practical independence. In 2012, he explained &quot;basically my last fax or whatever it was to EMI was literally just like &quot;fuck off&quot;... At that point I just said &quot;tell them we don’t want any more money, just say give me back the catalogue and I&#x27;ll walk and we&#x27;ll call it a day&quot;. Just to demonstrate how little it mattered to them, they said yes. It ended up on the front cover of &quot;Music Week&quot;... It was great to get my music back because otherwise they can do anything with it, they can just put it on a shelf, anything. Getting control of that back was the essence of being able to survive really, because since then I&#x27;ve had tracks in films and in television programmes and the money&#x27;s come to me instead of a black hole as it was with EMI. And also when you&#x27;re doing your own thing, it&#x27;s much nicer because you can surround yourself with people you want to be surrounded with.&quot;

Meanwhile, in January 1997, Chambers had departed the band in order to accept the role of musical director for Robbie Williams. This, in turn, led to Williams re-recording an &quot;Egyptology&quot; track, &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; (which had won Wallinger an Ivor Novello Award in 1997), and releasing it as a single in November 1999. The Williams version reached No. 1 in the UK charts. Chris Sharrock, plus World Party&#x27;s touring bassist of the time, performed on the new version, which was very similar to the World Party original apart from the addition of string orchestra parts. Wallinger was not informed about either the recording of the cover version or the involvement of members of his own band, later commenting &quot;it was very strange. Nobody phoned me to say they were doing it, and they used the band I’d just been on the road with to record it. It also annoyed me that Robbie didn’t sing the right words. It was a weird one: you lose your friends but you make loads of money.&quot;

Wallinger was further annoyed when Sharrock subsequently quit World Party to join Chambers in Williams&#x27; live band.
He would later admit to having experienced &quot;ongoing bitterness&quot; and that &quot;the song had a much better time than me, popping off to the Brits while I was at home eating crackers dipped in water&quot;. In 2012, he recalled &quot;at the time it seemed horribly clandestine and then Robbie stole my band and I was like, &quot;What are you doing, guys?&quot;...&quot;

With Catlin-Birch still on board, Wallinger released a fifth World Party album, &quot;Dumbing Up&quot;, in 2000 (which peaked at No. 64 on the UK Albums Chart). A lone single, &quot;Here Comes the Future&quot;, was released the same year, pointedly featuring the original version of &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; as a B-side.

Plans were made for touring in spring 2001, only to be cut short by Wallinger sufferering a brain aneurysm in February 2001 while cycling with his son on a Center Parcs holiday in Suffolk. He was left with damaged eyesight plus a prolonged (if temporary) inability to speak, play instruments or carry out any other musical activities.

All World Party activity was put on hold for five years while Wallinger recuperated and painstakingly learned how to play music again. During this time, he was sustained by royalties from the Williams cover of &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;. In 2012, he admitted &quot;thank God they did record it. It kept me and the family in spaghetti when I was ill and couldn’t work.&quot;

===Later period and final years===

In 2006 Wallinger re-emerged onto the scene. With his back catalogue reclaimed from EMI, a distribution deal was agreed (via his own Seaview label) with Universal, and he played his first live show in a decade at the South by Southwest festival in Texas, US. He played additional US dates in 2006 including the Bonnaroo Festival in Tennessee. &quot;Big Blue Ball&quot;, a joint project with Peter Gabriel with production work by Stephen Hague was also released.

Subsequent World Party activity was intermittent. In September 2007, World Party supported Steely Dan in their first tour of Australia. The &quot;Best in Show&quot; compilation was released to celebrate the Australian tour. In 2009, World Party toured the west coast of the US, and appeared at Seattle&#x27;s Bumbershoot Festival and San Francisco&#x27;s Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival.

In 2012, World Party released a new five-CD/70-song collection of new songs, live recordings and cover versions titled &quot;Arkeology&quot; to critical acclaim. The band toured extensively in America in 2012, and toured England for the first time in twelve years, ending with an appearance in November 2012 in London at the Royal Albert Hall. Live dates and tours followed through 2015, and a 2013 UK show was issued as a 2-CD set called &quot;World Party – Live!&quot;.

Following the end of their 2015 North American tour World Party no longer toured, released new material, or updated their website. Wallinger moved to Hastings and continued working on music while keeping a low profile. An interview with &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2021 revealed that Warlinger still hoped that &quot;a 63-year-old Welshman can say something relevant, post-apocalypse. Who knows how close it is to a parting shot?&quot; but also warned &quot;it&#x27;s useless to try to find out what I&#x27;m up to... (I&#x27;m) just a guy who makes noises in a room and plays them to as few people as possible.&quot;

In 2021 the World Party vinyl reissue campaign started with &quot;Egyptology&quot; receiving an expanded edition in 2022. 

In late 2022 interview with &quot;The Big Takeover&quot; Wallinger claimed to be close to finishing a new album, aiming to release it in early 2023. He claimed &quot;I’ve got twenty-odd years of material... What I’m trying to do is make everything the most contemporary version of things, rather than go back and just say, &quot;How can I finish these songs off and put them out?&quot; I want everything to be from around now, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m heading toward... I&#x27;m really looking forward to it. It&#x27;ll be just like rolling the stone away from the front of the cave and coming out again into the sunlight. I&#x27;ll be so happy to have an album out.&quot;

Karl Wallinger died on 10 March 2024 at the age of 66.

An expanded edition of World Party best of compilation &quot;Best in Show&quot; was released in 2025.

<text>Karl Edmond De Vere Wallinger (19 October 1957 – 10 March 2024) was a Welsh musician, songwriter and record producer. He was best known for leading the band World Party and for his mid-1980s membership of the Waterboys (contributing in particular to the arrangement and recording of their hit single &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;).

Wallinger&#x27;s songwriting credits include the World Party songs &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, which was a Top 40 hit in the United States, &quot;Way Down Now&quot;, which reached number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, and &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, which was later covered by Robbie Williams and became a hit single.

Wallinger was a multi-instrumentalist, which enabled him to demo and record the bulk of World Party material as a one-man band. Although he was right-handed, he played a right-handed guitar upside-down and left-handed.

==Early life and early musical work==
Wallinger was born on 19 October 1957, in Prestatyn, Wales, to Julian and Phyllis Wallinger, and was one of six children. His father was an architect. He showed musical promise from an early age, immersing himself in the music of the Beatles (notably studying &quot;Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and attempting not only to sing the words but to vocally recreate all of the sounds on the record), the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, the Kinks, Buddy Holly and the Motown label. This was followed by classical training in piano (from the age of nine) and oboe (from the age of ten). Having spent time at choir school at Eton College, his musical skills then won him a music scholarship to another public school, Charterhouse in Surrey. 

Wallinger&#x27;s musical career began in Prestatyn in 1977 as a keyboard player with Pax, before forming the short-lived band Quasimodo with Dave Sharp and Nigel Twist (who both went on to be in the Alarm). Having moved to London, he then had a job in music publishing working for Northern Songs. He played keyboards for Peter Straker and was featured on the album &quot;Changeling&quot;, on which he received a writing credit for the song &quot;Believer&quot;. In the same period he became musical director of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

==The Waterboys==
Answering a &quot;guitarist wanted&quot; advertisement for Mike Scott&#x27;s band the Waterboys, Wallinger instead persuaded Scott that the band needed a keyboard player. Joining in 1983, Wallinger played in the live band touring the first Waterboys album and contributed to the second album, &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;. 

Though Wallinger was initially hired to play piano and organ (and to sing occasional backing vocals), his multi-instrumental and production skills impressed Scott and ensured that he played a far greater role on the third Waterboys album, &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;, significantly contributing to the band&#x27;s &#x27;Big Music&#x27; sound. While Scott concentrated on Steve Reichian orchestrations of the songs using multitracked pianos and guitar, Wallinger fleshed out the material with a variety of synthesised orchestrations, synth bass and percussion instruments. Wallinger also wrote the original music for &quot;Don&#x27;t Bang the Drum&quot; (the opening track for &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;). Wallinger was particularly key to the final form of the best-known Waterboys song, &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, having taken Scott&#x27;s original voice/piano/guitar structure and introduced polyphonic synthesizer parts, synth bass, upbeat and off-beat cymbal accents (all of these influenced by Prince) and a final tumbling backing vocal (influenced by David Bowie), as well as bringing in drummer Chris Whitten. 

Musical rivalry and desire for control over creative credit made the relationship between Scott and Wallinger increasingly difficult and fractious, and in subsequent years the two would occasionally bicker publicly about who was responsible for the success of the music they created together. However, in 2012, Scott would remember, more generously, that &quot;Karl was always there for me. He was a great engineer, got great sounds, [and] was very patient while I would play nine different guitars. Reefers may have been involved, and some all-nights. We had a lot of laughs and philosophical discussions.&quot;&quot;This is The Sea&quot; producer Mick Glossop also spoke approvingly of Wallinger&#x27;s contributions: &quot;Karl&#x27;s a very giving person. He gave a lot to the Waterboys, certainly.&quot;

Aware that his own musical ambitions were bringing him into conflict with Scott, Wallinger opted to leave the Waterboys in late 1985 towards the end of their &#x27;This is the Sea&#x27; tour. He was replaced as Waterboys keyboard player by Guy Chambers. Many years later, Mike Scott commented that &quot;from the day I met (Karl) he was always writing his own songs... The label I was with, Ensign, gave him a record deal and he deserved it, of course, but it wasn&#x27;t the smartest move if they&#x27;d wanted to keep him in The Waterboys.&quot;

Leaving London, Wallinger relocated to Woburn and took up residence in a dilapidated former rectory in which to work on solo material (which would eventually emerge as World Party). During this time, Wallinger also worked on Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 1987 debut album &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot;.

==World Party==

World Party began as a solo studio project with Wallinger as a one-man-band (plus guests) exploring rock, pop, folk and funk ideas plus elements of other genres. In 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Graeme Thomson would summarise the band&#x27;s best work as &quot;sound(ing) like a man trying to cram all the love and joy of his own fandom into four minutes, to distil the essence of Bob Dylan, Prince, The Rolling Stones, Sly Stone, Van Morrison, The Beach Boys, perhaps above all The Beatles, into one bubbling, funky, heartfelt and slightly ramshackle homebrew.&quot; Thompson also noted that &quot;the big hitters in the World Party canon... sound like the best kind of pop music: ageless, beyond genre. Turn to them at any time and they will brighten any room.&quot;

Despite its solo origins, World Party would later become a successful live band, albeit with Wallinger as the lone consistent member. Other significant World Party contributors over the years included Guy Chambers, Jeff Trott and Dave Catlin-Birch (with guest appearances including Waterboys saxophonist Anthony Thistlethwaite, violinist Steve Wickham, and vocalist Sinéad O&#x27;Connor returning favours owed for Wallinger&#x27;s work on &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot;). In practise, however, Wallinger wrote nearly all of the songs alone as well as playing most of the instruments on the studio albums.

The first release under the World Party banner, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Private Revolution&quot;, was strongly keyboard-based, diverse in stylistic focus and Prince-influenced (coinciding with Wallinger signing a deal with Prince manager Steve Fargnoli), and spawned a hit single, &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;. The second album, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Jumbo&quot;, has been hailed as Wallinger&#x27;s masterpiece and as &quot;a restoration of ’60s pop values&quot;, consolidating Wallinger&#x27;s pop interests into a more organic live-band sound while maintaining his diversity of approach. It was voted &quot;album of the year&quot; by &quot;Q&quot; magazine, was nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;best alternative music performance&quot; in the US. and produced two hit singles, &quot;Way Down Now&quot; and &quot;Put the Message in the Box&quot;.

Three further well-received World Party studio albums were released over the following decade - &quot;Bang!&quot; (1993), &quot;Egyptology&quot; (1997) and &quot;Dumbing Up&quot; (2000). The band also scored one more hit single - &quot;Is It Like Today?&quot; - and released two compilation albums (the greatest hits set &quot;Best in Show&quot; and the &quot;Arkeology&quot; box set), as well as premiering the original version of &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; (a song written by Wallinger but later a Number One hit single for Robbie Williams). Shortly before his death, Wallinger had been working on a long-delayed sixth World Party album, although this has yet to be confirmed as being complete or ready for release.

World Party records were notable for their persistent commitment to green and environmentalist issues, initially at a time when this was unfashionable. 
This eventually extended to the no-frills, no-waste, communitarian-based packaging for &quot;Arkaeology&quot;, assembled by Wallinger and his own family and friends at home. Wallinger&#x27;s perspective on these matters has been labelled &quot;prescient and heartfelt, a fervent post-script to ’80s consumerism,&quot; and &quot;well ahead of the times.&quot; Wallinger himself has commented &quot;I wanted to personify the world and sing about her. I always thought it would have been great if Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; had been about the planet. Plus, if I stand on top of a mountain Julie Andrews-style, the hills do seem to be alive with the sound of music. You can say whatever you like about eco whatever, but if you fuck up the environment you&#x27;re going to die.&quot;

==Soundtracking, other songwriting and collaborations==
Throughout his career Wallinger continued to collaborate with others, including the aforementioned Sinead O&#x27;Connor while he also featured on the Bob Geldof album &quot;The Happy Club&quot; released in 1992. 

He was musical director on the 1994 film &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, composing an instrumental score and contributing the end title song &quot;When You Come Back to Me&quot; to the hit soundtrack album. He also contributed a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; to the &quot;Clueless&quot; soundtrack in 1995. His song &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; (originally released by World Party) was a hit for Robbie Williams. Wallinger also acted as a member of Bob Geldof&#x27;s backing band.

Two tracks by Wallinger are included on the 1997 compilation album &quot;Now and in Time to Be&quot;, a musical celebration of the works of Irish poet W. B. Yeats. The poem &quot;Politics&quot; was credited as having been interpreted by Wallinger, while World Party is acknowledged as a contributing artist on &quot;The Four Ages of Man&quot;.

In 2008, Real World Records released the album &quot;Big Blue Ball&quot; – the culmination of work begun by Wallinger and Peter Gabriel during the summers of 1991, 1992, and 1995, in which they coordinated recordings by dozens of international artists at Real World Studios. When Gabriel learned of Wallinger&#x27;s death in 2024, he referred to the 2008 project in a social media post: &quot;I had admired his work from afar but it was when we did a Real World Recording Week together that I had the most creative and fun week I have ever had in the studio. Karl was overflowing with wonderful musical ideas that blew us all away, all delivered with terrible jokes that had us laughing uncontrollably all day and night. He was such a gifted, natural writer and player, it was a tap that he could turn on at will, effortlessly.&quot;

==Personal life==
Wallinger was married to sculptor Suzie Zamit, who survives him. The two lived in Crouch End, north London, for many years before relocating to Hastings in 2017. Wallinger and Zamit had two children, Louis Wallinger and Nancy Zamit, and two grandchildren. Their daughter Nancy is a founding member of the comedy troupe Mischief Theatre.

In an interview with &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; freelancer Jay Hedblade, Wallinger revealed that he suffered a brain aneurysm in February 2001. After several months of writing for the band, he felt unwell, and asked his friends to call an ambulance to take him to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. He subsequently required surgery wherein the doctors had to block fibers near the optic nerve. Despite what would appear to be a full recovery, he lost his peripheral vision on the right side of both eyes. Although the aneurysm meant that he had to suspend all work for nearly five years, he eventually resumed touring in 2006.

Wallinger died from a stroke at his home in Hastings on 10 March 2024, at the age of 66.

<text>The Hell Gate Bridge (originally the New York Connecting Railroad Bridge) is a railroad bridge in New York City, New York, United States. The bridge carries two tracks of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and one freight track between Astoria, Queens, and Port Morris, Bronx, via Randalls and Wards Islands. Its main span is a steel through arch across Hell Gate, a strait of the East River that separates Wards Island from Queens. The bridge also includes several approach viaducts and two spans across smaller waterways. Including approaches, the bridge is long. It is one of the few rail connections from Long Island, of which Queens is part, to the rest of the United States.

The New York Connecting Railroad (NYCR) was formed in 1892 to build the bridge, linking New York and the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) with New England and the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad (NH). A cantilever bridge across Hell Gate was proposed in 1900, but the plan was changed to a through-arch bridge after repeated delays. Construction was overseen by the engineers Gustav Lindenthal, Othmar Ammann, and David B. Steinman and architect Henry Hornbostel. The bridge was dedicated on March 9, 1917, and was the world&#x27;s longest steel arch bridge until the Bayonne Bridge opened in 1931. Various proposals to modify the bridge in the 1920s were unsuccessful. The bridge was renovated in the 1990s following three decades of deterioration.

The main span is a two-hinged arch flanked by stone towers on either bank of Hell Gate. Northwest of the Hell Gate span, the viaduct is carried on plate-girder spans along the east side of Wards and Randalls Islands. A four-span inverted bowstring truss bridge, measuring , carries the railroad tracks across Little Hell Gate, a former stream between Randalls and Wards Islands. Further north is a , two-span truss bridge across Bronx Kill, a small strait separating Randalls Island from the Bronx. There are also steel-and-concrete approach viaducts in the Bronx and Queens. In addition to the three existing tracks on the bridge, there was a fourth track used by freight trains until the 1970s. The passenger tracks have been electrified since 1918, and the freight tracks also had electrification from 1927 to 1969. The Hell Gate Bridge has received commentary both for its design and its impact on Long Island&#x27;s commerce, and its design inspired that of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

==Development==

=== Planning ===
At the end of the 19th century, there was no direct rail connection between New England and New Jersey, nor between Long Island and the rest of the continental United States. Trains traveling between any of these locations had to use barges, which traversed New York City&#x27;s congested waterways. This spurred efforts to link the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), which operated to New Jersey and other states, with the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad (New Haven; NH), which operated to New England. At the time, the NH had a freight terminal in Port Morris, Bronx, where car floats transported railroad cars down the East River to Manhattan or New Jersey. Although the PRR&#x27;s North River Tunnels and East River Tunnels (completed in 1910) allowed passenger trains to travel between Long Island and New Jersey, no railroad line yet existed between Long Island and New England. Passengers traveling along the modern-day Northeast Corridor had to take a ferry from New Jersey and walk across Manhattan to Grand Central Terminal, or vice versa, to continue their journey.

==== 1890s progress ====
The New York Connecting Railroad (NYCR), headed by Oliver W. Barnes, was incorporated in April 1892 to build the bridge. Throughout the 1890s, the New York State Legislature considered various bills that would give the NYCR a franchise to construct a bridge from Long Island to the U.S. mainland, but to no avail. The NYCR planned for the bridge to carry a line from Manhattan to Brooklyn. In March 1898, U.S. representative John H. Ketcham proposed legislation to allow the NYCR to erect a bridge with two or more tracks across the Bronx Kill, Little Hell Gate, and Hell Gate waterways, connecting the Bronx (on the U.S. mainland) with Randalls Island, Wards Island, and Long Island. Although the federal government of the United States required that the clearance below any bridge across the East River (of which the Hell Gate was part) be above mean high water, the bill permitted a bridge as low as above mean high water.

By the beginning of 1899, the NYCR had received estimates for a bridge connecting Port Morris in the Bronx, Randalls Island, Wards Islands, and Astoria in Long Island. The , bridge was to connect the New York Central Railroad and NH lines in the Bronx with the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and South Brooklyn Railway lines on Long Island. A state senator introduced a bill in February 1899 to incorporate the Wards Island Bridge Company to construct the bridge. The following month, the NYCR&#x27;s directors held a meeting with New York Central&#x27;s directors about the construction of the line. The New York Central expressed interest in the planned Hell Gate Bridge, as the railroad intended to use it for both passenger and freight traffic.

==== Cantilever plan ====
The New York State Legislature passed a bill in April 1900, authorizing the NYCR to build a bridge from the Port Morris station in the Bronx to the Bushwick Junction station in Queens, and New York governor Theodore Roosevelt signed the bill the next month. Alfred P. Boller drew up plans for a cantilever bridge. The cantilever span was to measure long, wide, and high; the project, including of approach tracks, was to cost $5.5 million. The cantilever design was selected because it was cheaper than a suspension bridge of the same length. Construction of the bridge was to have begun in September 1900 and be completed in five years. Merchants from Brooklyn supported the bridge, saying it would reduce the cost of delivering goods to that borough. The bridge would also enable passenger trains from upstate New York and New England to travel to New Jersey via the East River and North River tunnels. Freight traffic would still be required to use car floats, as trains would not be able to fit into the tunnels; the car-float operation would be shifted south to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where trains would be floated across the New York Bay to Greenville, Jersey City.

By October 1900, grading of land for the bridge and its approach viaducts had commenced, and public hearings about the bridge were being hosted. Initially, the PRR did not intend to use the bridge, and the crossing was to connect with the trackage of the LIRR. After the PRR&#x27;s acquisition of the LIRR in 1900, the PRR began contemplating taking control of the Hell Gate Bridge. Ultimately, in 1901, the PRR and NH bought the NYCR. This was part of a larger plan to improve rail infrastructure in the New York City area, including a &quot;belt line&quot; for freight (now the Fremont Secondary and Bay Ridge Branch), of which the bridge was to be a part.

Work on the belt line was about to begin by early 1902, and surveys for the proposed bridge&#x27;s piers had been made by the end of the year. The PRR announced in February 1903 that it would build a double-tracked cantilever bridge, and it drew up a contract to order of steel from United States Steel. The bridge&#x27;s central span would have been the world&#x27;s longest cantilever span. &quot;The Port Chester Journal&quot; described the planned crossing as &quot;an unusual bridge in point of engineering skill&quot;. The PRR requested a perpetual franchise for the bridge from the New York City Rapid Transit Commission that June. PRR vice president Samuel Rea requested in March 1904 that the Rapid Transit Commission approve the bridge and belt line, and charge the PRR rent, so work could commence as soon as possible. That June, the Rapid Transit Commission granted a perpetual franchise for the bridge and belt line to the NYCR. The connecting railroad was to pay the New York City government a fee to cross the East River.

==== Arch plan ====
The PRR hired New York City bridge commissioner Gustav Lindenthal as its consulting structural engineer in 1904. To avoid hospitals on Wards Island, the viaduct needed to curve north immediately upon reaching Wards Island; this ruled out the original cantilever design, which required a straight &quot;anchor span&quot;. Instead, Lindenthal first considered a continuous truss bridge, a suspension bridge, and a cantilever bridge across Hell Gate. After rejecting all three designs, Lindenthal studied designs for a spandrel arch and a cantilever arch, both of which would be cheaper than either the suspension or cantilever proposals. The crescent-arch design would be thicker at its crown than at either end, while the spandrel-arch design would be thicker at its ends than at the crown. Although the crescent-arch design required less steel, Lindenthal liked the design of the spandrel arch because it appeared sturdier and because it complemented his designs for masonry towers at either end. Ultimately, he chose a modified form of the spandrel-arch design. His assistant Othmar Ammann wrote that the arch design would allow the bridge to serve as a figurative portal to the Port of New York and New Jersey.

In early 1905, the PRR sent engineers and workers to make borings for the bridge&#x27;s foundation in Astoria. Work on the bridge&#x27;s superstructure was delayed because the New York City Board of Aldermen would not approve several aspects of the franchise, prompting an unsuccessful proposal to remove the aldermen&#x27;s ability to grant franchises. Among other things, the aldermen wanted trains on the bridge to use electric power exclusively, provide space for vehicles and pedestrians, and the city to be allowed to add utility wires to the bridge. New York Governor Frank W. Higgins signed a bill in mid-1905, allowing the start of construction to be postponed by several months. That November, the NYCR asked the Rapid Transit Commission to renew its application for a franchise, citing delays from the Board of Aldermen. The negotiations over the franchise sometimes turned contentious, but the PRR ultimately was promised a franchise from the city in December 1906. By then, the bridge was planned to fit four tracks, though only two would be used initially. The original two-track plan had been changed after the architects found that the cost of converting a two-track bridge to four tracks would be much higher than the upfront cost of a four-track bridge.

The New York City Board of Estimate approved the NYCR&#x27;s franchise in February 1907. Rea submitted plans for the arch bridge in May 1907 to the city&#x27;s Municipal Art Commission. The arch would have a clear span of , the longest of its kind in the world, and would carry two passenger tracks and two freight tracks. The remainder of the bridge would be a viaduct made of reinforced concrete and steel plate girders. The plans were drawn up by consulting engineer Gustav Lindenthal and architects Palmer and Hornbostel. That June, the Rapid Transit Commission voted to amend the NYCR&#x27;s franchise. The franchise allowed the NYCR to construct a viaduct across Wards Island, placing the railroad in possible conflict with the New York State Hospital Commission, which had leased the island from the city, although the hospital commission ultimately did allow engineers to survey the island. The Municipal Art Commission rejected the original bridge plans in July 1907 as &quot;not artistic&quot;.

==== Land acquisition and finalization of plans ====

During the late 1900s, the NH and PRR acquired land for the bridge&#x27;s right-of-way. The first house in the bridge&#x27;s right-of-way was relocated at the beginning of 1908. The Pennsylvania Railroad announced in December 1908 that, as soon as Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan was completed, the railroad would begin constructing the bridge. The bridge was to cost up to $20 million. By early 1909, the NH had acquired all of the necessary land for the Bronx approach, while the PRR was still acquiring land in Queens for both the passenger and freight lines. The PRR agreed to buy the last piece of land for the Queens approach that July, at which point the cost of the bridge had increased to $25 million. The NYCR&#x27;s engineers prepared new plans for the main span&#x27;s piers the same year. That December, the PRR and NH agreed to share the cost of the bridge&#x27;s construction. The Hell Gate Bridge was to be the fifth bridge across the East River (after the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Queensboro bridges), as well as the first built by a private company rather than the city government.

By early 1910, the plans for the arch&#x27;s piers were being revised, and surveyors were studying the route of the bridge and its approaches. The plans for the steelwork were revised the same year to accommodate a heavier type of trackbed. The PRR, NH, and LIRR were concurrently finalizing contracts for the construction of the NYCR line, which had commenced in mid-1910. The revised plans for the main span were not submitted to the Municipal Art Commission until early 1911, and a contract for the bridge&#x27;s steel had still not been awarded. The PRR took title to the last remaining land lots in Queens in June 1911. By the end of the year, the designs for the Bronx Kill and Little Hell Gate spans were still being revised, and land condemnation for the bridge was nearly finished. Lindenthal estimated in late 1911 that the bridge would cost $18 million and be completed in 1914. The Municipal Art Commission ultimately approved the revised plans.

=== Construction ===
==== Initial contracts ====
Excavations for the Astoria end of the main span, across Hell Gate, commenced in March 1911, and were nearly completed by the end of the year. The American Bridge Company received a contract for the steelwork on the Hell Gate span, Wards Island viaduct, and Queens approach viaduct, while the McClintic-Marshall Company was hired to manufacture steel for the other parts of the bridge. The Carnegie Steel Company was hired in early 1912 to roll the steel plates for the bridge. Later that year, Patrick Ryan, the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s main contractor, received a $2 million contract to build the bridge&#x27;s foundation, while John A. Gray received a contract to complete test borings for the bridge. Masonry contracts were awarded to Patrick Ryan (who partnered with U.S. Realty to build the Hell Gate spans&#x27; towers), as well as Arthur McMullin and T. A. Gillespie. Harold W. Hudson was the chief construction engineer.

Work formally commenced on the Bronx and Queens approach viaducts in July 1912, and work on the foundations of the main span&#x27;s towers began that September, though no above-ground work had commenced. By October 1912, workers were preparing to lower caissons for the main span&#x27;s Wards Island tower, as the underlying layer of rock was over deep and was covered by layers of sand, coarse gravel, and boulders. Twenty-one caissons were used to excavate the Wards Island tower&#x27;s foundation. The caissons were larger and deeper than those used in the construction of the tallest buildings in New York City at the time. The caisson-sinking process was further complicated by the discovery of a diagonal fissure in the underlying rock. It ultimately took seven months to sink the caissons and ensure that the tower would not be susceptible to settlement.

In November 1912, a New York Supreme Court justice enjoined the contractors from erecting abutments on Wards Island. The operators of the Manhattan Psychiatric Center claimed that patients would be disturbed by loud noises, both during construction and after the bridge opened, but the city government claimed that the hospital&#x27;s lease of the island had expired. The injunction was lifted in January 1913, when the State Supreme Court ruled that the law permitting the bridge&#x27;s construction overrode the law that restricted railroads above the grounds of a hospital.

==== Pier construction ====
The construction of piers on Randalls and Wards Islands and in Queens began in February 1913. Derricks were used to construct the concrete piers under the Bronx Kill, Randalls Island, Little Hell Gate, and Wards Island spans. The foundations of the Bronx Kill span&#x27;s piers were constructed using caissons, since the underlying layer of rock was nearly deep. The foundations of the Little Hell Gate span&#x27;s piers were built in open cofferdams due to the shallowness of that strait. The contractor built a dock on Wards Island to load and unload material. Derricks carried solid materials from the dock to a conveyor belts, which in turn led to covered storage bins, while cement was poured down a chute to a cement house next to the storage bins. Sand, stone, and cement from the bins were dumped into &quot;charging cars&quot; and carried to a mixing plant, where the material was mixed into concrete. Elevators were used to transport concrete to the top of each pier.

By July 1913, some of the piers and retaining walls for the Bronx and Queens viaducts had been constructed, and contractors had installed temporary plants on Randalls and Wards Islands. The next month, the PRR and NH announced that the NYCR would issue a $30 million mortgage and $11 million in bonds to fund the construction of the Hell Gate Bridge and associated lines; the railroads had spent $8.6 million to date on the bridge. The bonds were issued later that year. During a site visit in mid-1914, a local civic group noted that a temporary span had been finished across Bronx Kill and that piers were being built within the riverbed of Little Hell Gate. The main span&#x27;s towers had reached the height of the deck by the end of 1914, while almost all of the other piers had been completed by then.

==== Steelwork and completion ====
Steel girders and plates for the Little Hell Gate and Bronx Kill spans were being installed by late 1914. The girders under the two center tracks were installed first. Afterward, the center tracks were laid, and a derrick car and a locomotive crane were placed on opposite spans. The derrick car delivered girders that had already been riveted together, and the locomotive crane installed the girders for the outer tracks. The arched main span above Hell Gate was technically challenging because Hell Gate was a navigable waterway, and the arch could not be constructed using falsework. Consequently, massive temporary backstays were built behind both of the Hell Gate towers to cantilever the two pieces of the arch. To accommodate the backstays, the tops of the towers and some adjacent piers could not be completed until after the Hell Gate span was finished. After the backstays were constructed, movable derricks were installed atop the backstays.

One thousand workers and 40 engineers began installing the steelwork of the arch in November 1914; many of the laborers were Mohawk Native American ironworkers from Quebec and upstate New York. Work proceeded in two sections from either shore toward the middle of Hell Gate. The main span consisted of 23 panels, which were installed by the derricks atop the backstays. The panels were composed of steel pieces that weighed as much as . The steel pieces were manufactured off-site and, at the time, were among the heaviest steel pieces ever manufactured. Each piece was delivered to the site via car floats, then transported up via derricks. To counteract sagging caused by the weight of the panels, both halves of the bridge occasionally had to be adjusted. The project as a whole was declared half-finished in July 1915. The last pieces of the lower chord were installed during the week of September 28 to October 4, 1915, and both halves were officially joined on October 1. The gap between the two parts of the arch was just . The extreme precision was attributed to the level of detail in the engineering drawings, as well as the use of highly precise surveying tools made by the W. &amp; L. E. Gurley Company.

The completion of the arch made the Hell Gate span the longest steel arch in the world. The hydraulic jacks were removed from the towers, and the backstays were disassembled and reused in the approach viaducts. Workers began driving 400,000 rivets into the arched span; Lindenthal claimed that they were among the largest rivets ever used. Due to cold weather, the upper chord of the arch could not be riveted together until May 1916. Locomotive cranes constructed the remaining portions of the viaducts. By mid-October 1916, the PRR and NH anticipated that passenger service would commence at the beginning of 1917. Finishing touches were placed on the bridge during late 1916. In total, the bridge cost $18.5 million. Before the bridge&#x27;s official opening, police forces patrolled it to prevent sabotage during World War I.

== Operational history ==

=== Opening ===
The first train ran across the bridge at a dedication ceremony on March 9, 1917, on a track constructed for the occasion. The Hell Gate Bridge was not complete; workers were still laying tracks, and the line was not electrified. Intercity passenger trains began running on April 1 with the rerouting of the NH&#x27;s &quot;Federal Express&quot; via the bridge. The Hell Gate span was the world&#x27;s longest steel arch bridge until the Bayonne Bridge, between New York and New Jersey, was completed in 1931. Its completion enabled passengers to travel the length of the Northeast Corridor without having to transfer to a ferry. Ammann initially estimated that the bridge would be mostly used by freight trains, because capacity constraints at Pennsylvania Station limited the bridge&#x27;s two passenger tracks to 80 trains a day, and because most NH trains were planned to continue running to Grand Central.

In mid-1917, NYCR applied for permission to issue $1.5 million in bonds to finish the bridge. The bridge started carrying other routes in late 1917, such as the PRR&#x27;s &quot;Colonial Express,&quot; the &quot;Washington-Bar Harbor Express&quot;, and a short-lived St. Louis–Pittsburgh–Boston route. Commuter services continued to run to Grand Central Terminal. Though the bridge only carried rail traffic when it opened, it could also be adapted for pedestrian and car traffic. By the end of 1917, all four tracks were complete, and freight trains began running across the bridge in January 1918. At the time, the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; wrote that the bridge would be able to accommodate 240 freight cars daily. The passenger tracks were also electrified by 1918.

During World War I, when the federal government took control of railroad lines in the U.S., the New York Central began using the Hell Gate Bridge, allowing Long Island merchants to send products directly to the mainland via any railroad. The bridge was carrying only four passenger trains per day by September 1918, amid the war. The media wrote that, due to its low use, the bridge&#x27;s construction cost was unlikely to be recouped. As late as 1919, the bridge was still carrying very limited passenger service because of wartime restrictions that diverted train traffic. The New York Central stopped using the bridge in November 1920 after the PRR and NH raised the bridge&#x27;s freight-transport fees, and the New York Central began using car floats to Long Island instead.

=== 1920s proposals ===

When the Triborough (now RFK) Bridge nearby was first proposed in 1920, Lindenthal suggested that the Hell Gate Bridge&#x27;s main span could be retrofitted with an upper deck for vehicular and pedestrian use, a proposal that he repeated in 1924. Civic organizations across the city supported the extra deck, and the engineering firm of Robinson and Steinman conducted a study, finding that it was feasible to add the deck. In late 1926, mayor Jimmy Walker appointed a committee to consider the plan. Albert Goldman, the Commissioner of Plant and Structures, estimated that the Hell Gate Bridge only had enough space for five lanes of roadway, so a new bridge would have to be constructed parallel to it. Accordingly, the Triborough Bridge was proposed as an entirely new bridge in March 1927, and that span would open in 1936.

Meanwhile, the Port of New York Authority, which sought to increase the number of freight trains that used the Hell Gate Bridge, hosted hearings in late 1924 to determine whether New York Central freight trains should be allowed to use the bridge, The Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and Long Island shippers endorsed the proposal, while the LIRR, NH, and PRR opposed it. The Port Authority ordered the PRR and NH to allow New York Central trains on the bridge in February 1925. The order was modified to exclude freight to and from New England, but the PRR and NH still refused to allow the New York Central to use the bridge after thirty days. A spur route from the bridge, which would have allowed trains from the Bronx to travel to a new terminal in Long Island City, was proposed the same year. PRR officials opposed the plan because it would strain the capacity of the bridge&#x27;s two western tracks, and ultimately the spur was canceled. By the end of 1925, the bridge was carrying 1,200 freight cars per day.

In early 1926, the Port Authority asked the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to allow all freight trains on the bridge. The PRR and NH again opposed the move, and the PRR argued that allowing other railroads&#x27; trains on the bridge would discourage railroads from improving routes used by competitors. ICC examiners recommended opening the bridge only to freight trains toward Long Island; at the time, traffic to Long Island constituted 88 percent of the island&#x27;s freight traffic volume. The Port Authority continued to advocate for allowing all railroads to use the bridge in both directions. The freight tracks were electrified in 1927. The Port Authority also asked the ICC to lower the fees charged on freight trains using the bridge. The ICC ruled in 1928 that the railroads were not required to lower their rates but that they were required to allow other railroads to use the bridge during emergencies or when other routes were congested.

=== 1930s to 1960s ===

By 1932, residents of Long Island were advocating for the construction of a second rail link between their island and the Bronx, due to the lack of direct freight service to eastern Long Island via the Hell Gate Bridge. The same year, the ICC hosted hearings over whether to run passenger trains over the bridge between eastern Long Island and New England; the ICC ultimately rejected a Long Island–New England passenger train as impractical, inconvenient, and of little benefit. In 1934, the NH put up its share of the bridge as collateral for a $6 million loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The NH was allowed to take back its portion of the bridge even if the RFC foreclosed on the loan; the NH declared bankruptcy the next year, remaining under trusteeship until 1947.

During World War II, in 1940, officials disarmed a live bomb under the Hell Gate Bridge. The bridge&#x27;s economic value made it a target of Operation Pastorius, a Nazi sabotage plan, which was thwarted in 1942. The NYCR began leasing out land around the bridge&#x27;s approach viaducts to nearby property owners in the 1940s. The property owners paid an annual fee and were obliged to maintain the land. Additionally, passengers had to pay a surcharge on tickets for train trips that used the bridge, unless they were traveling to or from New York City; the surcharge had resulted an estimated $20.9 million in revenue for the bridge from 1920 to 1950. The surcharge prompted investigations from the ICC in the mid-1940s and again in 1951, but the surcharge was upheld both times.

Train traffic in the U.S. started to decrease in the mid-20th century as a result of increased automobile usage. This adversely affected both of the NYCR&#x27;s co-owners and caused the bridge to fall into disrepair. The NH had declared bankruptcy in 1961 but continued to own a 50% stake in the bridge. A feasibility study on the possible liquidation of the NH found that the bridge&#x27;s salvage value was equal to the theoretical cost of demolition. The PRR&#x27;s own issues compelled it to merge with New York Central in 1968, forming the Penn Central Transportation Company, which also included the NH. Penn Central itself filed for bankruptcy in 1970 and was absorbed by Conrail in 1976.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, there were suggestions to transfer ownership of the bridge to the New York City Transit Authority and to run commuter rail across the bridge. In addition, there had been concerns about the bridge&#x27;s upkeep as early as 1967, when debris from the bridge fell to the ground near Astoria Park. The freight tracks were de-electrified in 1969.

=== 1970s to 1990s ===

The New Jersey car float was closed for an extended period during the 1970s, making the Hell Gate Bridge the only way for freight trains to get to and from Long Island during that time. One of the bridge&#x27;s freight tracks was abandoned during that decade as well. The lack of rail crossings of the Hudson River, to the west, also meant that freight trains from Long Island had to detour to upstate New York just to travel west or south. Freight trains from the west also had to make several tight turns to reach the Hell Gate Bridge. New York state voters approved a bond issue in 1974, which provided $250 million for numerous upgrades to New York City&#x27;s railroads. The upgrades included modifications to allow double-stack freight trains to use the Hell Gate Bridge, thereby reducing the need for cargo trucks to travel through the city.

Amtrak took over the bridge itself, and the passenger services that used it, by 1975, while Conrail began operating additional freight trains over it during the same decade. Vandals frequently threw rocks from the bridge and set fires, which had prompted Penn Central, and later Amtrak, to increase security on the bridge. By the late 1970s, debris was falling from the approach viaducts. Due to poor drainage, water had seeped through the viaducts, causing rocks to come loose. City councilman Peter Vallone Sr. and U.S. representative Mario Biaggi advocated for Amtrak to repair the viaducts, saying the conditions threatened local residents&#x27; lives. Amtrak started repairing the viaducts in 1978 but paused the repairs the next year. When the project resumed in 1980, workers added welded steel plates on the trackbeds to prevent objects from falling. Even after the repairs were finished, local residents continued to express concerns about the viaduct&#x27;s structural integrity. Additionally, the bridge&#x27;s paint was peeling off by the late 1980s. Sources disagree on whether the bridge had last been repainted in 1939 or whether it had never been repainted at all; in either case, Amtrak&#x27;s own vice president said the bridge should have been repainted three times in the previous half-century.

Vallone asked the federal government to fix the bridge after falling debris broke a car&#x27;s window in 1988. Vallone and U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan requested that Amtrak devise a plan for repairing the bridge, though Amtrak officials denied that there was deterioration. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the bridge in 1991 as &quot;a flaking and crumbling symbol of urban decay and decline&quot;. Moynihan convened a United States Senate hearing in 1990 after attempting to contact Amtrak officials about the bridge; at the hearing, Amtrak officials testified that the bridge did not need repainting. The officials also estimated the cost of repainting at $43 million, though Moynihan disputed these estimates. By then, city officials had issued several warnings to pedestrians and drivers about the bridge&#x27;s safety. The United States Congress allocated $55 million to renovate the bridge in late 1991, which included $42 million for repainting and $13 million for structural improvements. In exchange, the New York State Department of Transportation had to provide matching funds for 20 percent of the federal allocation. At the time, 20 Amtrak trains used the bridge every day.

Workers began renovating the bridge in April 1992; at Moynihan&#x27;s request, the Municipal Art Society asked six architects and artists to decide the color in which the bridge should be painted. The bridge was repainted a deep red hue known as Hell Gate Red. The paint consisted of two layers of epoxy coating, a urethane layer, and a clear layer to protect against ultraviolet rays and corrosion. Due to a flaw in the paint, the red color began to fade before the work was completed. The repainting was completed in 1996, and graffiti began to appear on the viaducts shortly afterward. Beginning in the 1990s, local residents and students painted several murals under the Queens approach viaduct. Providence and Worcester Railroad freight trains carrying stone from quarries in Connecticut began using the bridge in 1996 to reach Long Island. The Oak Point Link near the bridge&#x27;s Bronx end was completed in 1998, allowing freight trains from the Hudson Line (to the west) to access the bridge without having to make multiple tight turns. In addition, as part of the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Congress allocated $15 million to repaint the bridge. By then, 34 Amtrak trains used the bridge daily.

=== 2000s to present ===
In the first decade of the 21st century, the bridge carried around 41 passenger trains per weekday, as well as less frequent freight-train service. Debris still fell from the bridge&#x27;s approach viaducts due to both vandalism and general neglect, and Vallone said in 2001 that the paint had started to peel off. Security on the bridge was increased following the September 11 attacks. In 2002, state government officials announced plans to spend $11.8 million to replace the bridge&#x27;s freight track so it could support heavier trains. After Peter Vallone Jr. was elected to his father&#x27;s city council seat, the younger Vallone also unsuccessfully requested that Amtrak repaint the bridge throughout much of the 2000s. Following further reports of cracks and falling debris, Amtrak workers installed steel plates on the trackbed in the mid-2000s. Amtrak proposed raising rental fees for the land under the bridge&#x27;s approach viaducts in 2006, in some cases as much as 100,000 percent. After further lobbying from the younger Vallone, Amtrak agreed to repair parts of the approach in 2008.

The bridge&#x27;s paint continued to fade during the 2010s. Local residents also requested that Amtrak add more lighting to the bridge, which was illuminated at night by a small number of lights below the deck. By early 2016, several local politicians were advocating for Amtrak to repaint the bridge in advance of its centennial, citing the fact that various parts of the spans had become discolored. That year, Amtrak increased rental fees for the land under the bridge from tens of dollars to as much as $40,000 a year. The railroad reversed the rent increases following outcry from local residents. The Greater Astoria Historical Society, in conjunction with Amtrak, celebrated the centennial of the bridge&#x27;s opening in 2017. As part of Penn Station Access, in the 2020s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) began upgrading the Hell Gate Line to accommodate the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line.

==Description==

The Hell Gate Bridge was originally known as the New York Connecting Railroad Bridge or as the East River Bridge Division. It consists of five spans, which connect the New York City boroughs of the Bronx to the north with Queens to the south. Three of the spans cross the Hell Gate, Little Hell Gate, and the Bronx Kill waterways, while the other two spans run above Randalls and Wards Islands. Including approach viaducts in the Bronx and Queens, the Hell Gate Bridge is composed of seven sections. Together with approaches, the bridge has been cited as being , more than , or long. Gustav Lindenthal was the chief engineer for the bridge; he was assisted by the engineers Othmar Ammann and David B. Steinman. In addition, Henry Hornbostel was the bridge&#x27;s architect.

The Hell Gate Bridge is used exclusively as a railroad bridge, carrying passenger trains traveling between New York Penn Station and the Bronx, as well as freight trains heading between Queens and the Bronx. The Hell Gate Bridge parallels the Hell Gate and Bronx Kill legs of the Robert F. Kennedy (formerly Triborough) Bridge to the west. The span across Hell Gate is oriented roughly from northwest to southeast, while the other two spans are oriented from northeast to southwest. The bridge was built with provisions for an upper level if the need arose. The entire bridge required of steel and of concrete. The decks of each span are all made of concrete panels, which carry track beds with ballast; this was intended to reduce noise pollution and is unusual for a railroad bridge. The February 2005 issue of &quot;Discover&quot; magazine estimated that, if humans were to disappear, the bridge could last for at least a millennium; most other bridges would fall in about 300 years.

=== Main span ===
The main span is a spandrel arch across the Hell Gate strait, flanked by large stone towers on either bank of the strait. When the main span was completed, it was sometimes referred to specifically as the Hell Gate Bridge or as the East River Arch Bridge.

==== Arch and deck ====
The main span measures long between the outer faces of the masonry &quot;towers&quot; on either side of Hell Gate. The clear span (between the inner faces) is , while the distance between the centers of these towers is . At the center of the main span, the deck reaches its maximum height, above mean high water, with a clearance below of . The main span was intended to carry a total load of approximately 76,000 pounds per lineal foot, or kilograms per lineal meter. The span uses high-carbon steel because it was cheaper than nickel steel at the time of construction. In total, the main span required between of rolled steel.

The span is a two-hinged arch; there are hinges at the springing points of the arch (at the bases of the towers on either side of Hell Gate). The arch&#x27;s beams run along the north and south sides of a deck. On either side of the deck is an upper chord, with an inverted U-shaped cross section, and a lower chord, with a box-shaped cross section. The two chords are apart at either shore of Hell Gate, narrowing to apart at the middle of the river. Each lower chord ranges in thickness from approximately , and the thickest sections of the lower chord are divided into two compartments. The upper chord is thinner and functions like a stiffening truss; it is shaped like a hump, both for structural reinforcement and for esthetic purposes. It reaches a maximum height of or above mean high water. Beams run vertically and diagonally between the upper and lower chords. There is also transverse bracing between the upper chords and lower chords on either side of the bridge.

Eight stringers, or girders, run parallel to and under the tracks for the entire length of the deck. Four additional stringers were intended to support unbuilt walkways or trolley tracks on either side. These are intersected by 24 transverse floor beams. Sixteen of the transverse beams are suspended from the lower chord, while the other eight beams are riveted to the vertical trusses between the lower and upper chords. Additional girders are used to stabilize the floor of the deck.

==== Towers ====
Hornbostel was responsible for the towers on either shore of Hell Gate, which were designed to resemble castle keeps. They measure high and are made of concrete; the towers are clad with Maine granite above ground level. At the bases of each tower are two cast-steel hinges, one for each of the lower chords. The Queens tower sits atop a layer of rock below the ground. The layer of rock on the Wards Island side is substantially deeper, descending more than , and so the Wards Island tower sits atop a deep caisson foundation. At ground level, the towers have a cross section of . Each tower has a &quot;shoulder&quot;, upon which the lower chords rest, and the towers&#x27; dimensions shrink above this shoulder.

The upper portions of each tower are hollow and contain staircases. Steel girders inside the towers support the tracks, but the towers are otherwise largely ornamental. The upper section of each tower contains archways on all four sides. There are also loophole-like openings flanking the tracks. The tops of the towers are surrounded by parapets. Space for railroad equipment, such as switch tower machinery, was provided on the roof of each tower.

=== Randalls and Wards Islands viaducts ===
Northwest of the Hell Gate span, the viaduct curves about 90 degrees to the northeast, running along the east side of Wards and Randalls Islands. The viaduct above Wards Island is about long and consists of 30 plate girder sections, which are each between long. Each pier consists of a concrete arch measuring up to high and around across at its base. The arches are composed of two legs connected by an arched girder. North of the Wards Island viaduct, trains cross the former Little Hell Gate strait to reach the Randalls Island viaduct. The viaduct across Randalls Island is about long and measures about high. It is supported by concrete arches similar to those on Wards Island. The arches support 24 plate-girder sections that measure between long.

The viaduct ramps down as it continues north from Wards Island to Randalls Island. The original plans for the piers called for them to be made for steel lattices. The metal piers were changed to concrete both because the Municipal Art Commission disapproved of the steel-lattice design, and because there were concerns that the islands&#x27; prisoners and psychiatric patients could escape by climbing the trestles. In addition, when the plans for the piers were changed in 1914, metal had become more expensive than concrete.

==== Little Hell Gate Bridge ====
Between the Randalls and Wards Islands viaducts is the Little Hell Gate Bridge, an inverted bowstring truss bridge. The inverted bowstring truss span is long, as measured from the centers of the abutments on either side. The Little Hell Gate Bridge consists of four sections of nearly equal length, although two are slightly longer than the others. Each section is composed of linked eyebars measuring wide.

The bridge is supported by three piers, which are skewed because they follow the former course of Little Hell Gate. Each pier is composed of a reinforced concrete arch held up by two circular columns. The portion of each pier below the former strait&#x27;s water level is made of granite. Because Little Hell Gate was never a navigable waterway, the United States Department of War had allowed the builders to construct the piers within the strait itself. Little Hell Gate was infilled in the 1960s.

=== Bronx Kill span ===

A fixed truss bridge crosses the Bronx Kill strait. It consists of two truss sections that are each long. The span is supported by a central pier between the two trusses, as well as by &quot;tower piers&quot; at either end. The piers are clad with granite below the mean water level and concrete above. Although the center and south piers are placed on solid rock, the north pier is placed on spread footings because the underlying layer of rock descends sharply to the north. The north pier measures high and wide, with a large arched opening underneath. Originally, the Bronx Kill passed diagonally under the truss spans.

The Bronx Kill span was planned as a double-leaf bascule drawbridge, although the Bronx Kill was not a navigable waterway even at the time of the bridge&#x27;s construction. As such, the piers under the span had space for drawbridge machinery, and the span had a clearance below of . Underneath the Bronx Kill span is the Hell Gate Pathway, which continues underneath the Randalls and Wards Islands viaducts.

=== Approach viaducts ===
The height of the arch above Hell Gate required that the line be placed on an elevated viaduct between Long Island City and Port Morris. The viaduct is almost entirely composed of steel and concrete, except for small segments at either end, where the line is carried on an embankment with retaining walls. The steel viaduct is carried on approximately 150 concrete piers.

==== Bronx viaduct ====
In the Bronx, the Hell Gate Bridge has an approach viaduct measuring long and descends at a grade of up to 1.2 percent. The NH used helper locomotives during the 20th century to assist freight trains traversing the approach viaduct&#x27;s grade. The Bronx viaduct merges with the former four-track Port Morris Branch (now the one-track Oak Point Link) at 142nd Street in Port Morris. Separate ramps carry the western and eastern pairs of tracks down to the level of the Port Morris Branch. As built, the western ramp descended between the Port Morris Branch&#x27;s western and eastern pairs of tracks, while the eastern ramp descended to the east of the Port Morris Branch. Two sets of piers carry the ramps northward from the Bronx Kill span to 132nd Street.

From the Bronx Kill north to 132nd Street, the four-track-wide viaduct consists of plate girders, which rest on concrete piers. Each pier is less than tall and has an arched opening at the base. The Hell Gate Pathway runs underneath the arches. The viaduct splits into two ramps north of 132nd Street, each with space for two tracks. Between 132nd and 138th Street, the ramps are largely supported by rectangular concrete piers. The plate girders run parallel to each other, under the tracks, and are intersected perpendicularly by I-beams, which support the concrete-and-ballast trackbeds above. The western ramp crosses over the Port Morris Branch&#x27;s former eastern pair of tracks from 132nd to 133rd Street and is supported by large steel cross-girders. Between 138th and 142nd streets, the line is carried on an embankment measuring long.

==== Queens viaduct ====
The Queens approach viaduct descends at a grade of no more than 0.72 percent and is carried over local streets. It ranges from above ground. The section west of 29th Street measures long and was originally known as the Long Island viaduct. The western viaduct is very similar to those above Randalls and Wards Islands, but the piers of the Queens viaduct use shallow foundations due to the presence of gravel and sand under the viaduct. The gravel and sand could not accommodate loads of more than , so the Queens viaduct is supported by especially wide concrete piers.

The section from 29th to 44th Street measures long and was originally called the eastern viaduct. Reinforced concrete round arches carry the line over several streets in Astoria. The approach viaduct crosses above the New York City Subway&#x27;s elevated Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard station at 31st Street, and three-centered arches were used at two locations where a flatter arch was required. Warren truss bridges carry the line diagonally above intersections. The truss-bridge segments typically measure long and consist of heavy box-section columns that are made of built-up I-beams. Along the remainder of the eastern viaduct, the tracks run atop compacted land fill, which is enclosed by retaining walls. The retaining walls are made of slabs that are bolted together, while the fill came from the excavation of Sunnyside Yard.

East of 44th Street, the viaduct ends, and the line descends onto an embankment. The passenger and freight tracks branch off in western Queens, past the end of the viaduct.

==Usage==
The bridge carries two passenger rail tracks, which are part of Amtrak&#x27;s electrified Northeast Corridor line, and one freight rail track, which is part of the New York Connecting Railroad&#x27;s Fremont Secondary line. The Northeast Corridor tracks comprise one of Long Island&#x27;s few railroad connections to the continental U.S. The bridge uses a track gauge of , the U.S. standard gauge. The passenger tracks are electrified by overhead wire, and the freight tracks were electrified until 1969. Amtrak owns the bridge.

===Services===

==== Passenger rail ====
The bridge&#x27;s two western tracks are part of the Hell Gate Line and are used for &quot;Acela Express&quot; and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; service between New York and Boston. The speed limit for passenger trains is on the bridge itself and on the approach viaducts. Past the bridge, the Hell Gate Line continues north to New Rochelle, where it merges with the mainline portion of Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line, and south to Harold Interlocking, where it merges with the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Main Line. The bridge has traditionally been used by long-distance trains. It has also hosted occasional commuter services, such as special Metro-North services from Connecticut to the Meadowlands station in New Jersey. Before the opening of the Empire Connection in 1991, all Amtrak trains traveling from New York Penn Station to upstate New York and New England had to use the bridge.

In 1962, a regional transportation committee proposed running commuter rail trains from Connecticut to New York Penn Station via the Hell Gate Bridge, in advance of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The proposal was again studied in 1969 and 1973, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) initially dismissed the commuter-rail plan as infeasible. A plan to run some New Haven Line trains over the bridge was again proposed in the 1990s; the main obstacle to the plan was a lack of track space at Penn Station. The MTA studied the plan in 2000s as part of the Penn Station Access project, along with new stations on the Hell Gate Line in the Bronx. Amtrak and the MTA reached an agreement regarding track usage rights in 2019, and construction on Penn Station Access commenced in 2022, after the completion of East Side Access freed up space at Penn Station. , New Haven Line trains were expected to begin running to Penn Station in 2028.

There have been proposals for the bridge to carry rapid transit as well. In 1950 and again in 1954, Bronx borough president James J. Lyons proposed running a subway line between Manhattan and the Bronx via the bridge. The Triboro RX subway line, between the Bronx and Brooklyn, was proposed in the 1990s and would have used the Hell Gate Bridge. The Triboro RX plan was scaled down after the MTA determined that it would not be feasible to operate rapid transit on the bridge when Penn Station Access was finished.

==== Freight rail ====
On the eastern side of the bridge is the New York Connecting Railroad&#x27;s single-track line, which links New York City and Long Island to the North American mainland. The track forms part of the Fremont Secondary. It carries trains of the CSX, Canadian Pacific, and Providence &amp; Worcester railroads from Oak Point Yard in the Bronx to Fresh Pond Yard in Queens, where they connect with the New York and Atlantic Railway to Long Island. Another track was abandoned in the 1970s and totally removed in the late 1990s. The speed limit for freight trains is .

=== Electrification ===
As completed, none of the bridge&#x27;s four tracks had electrification. Although the passenger tracks were electrified by 1918, some steam locomotives continued to travel across the bridge through the 1920s. Freight trains had to switch between electric and steam-powered locomotives at Oak Point Yard. The New York State Legislature passed the Kaufman Act in 1923, mandating the electrification of all railways in New York City, including the freight routes on the Hell Gate Bridge, by January 1, 1926. The freight tracks were still not electrified in late 1925, but the NH was allowed to continue using the bridge and was given until mid-1928 to fully electrify the line. Electric freight service began in July 1927. As a result of electrification, freight trains from Bay Ridge could travel as far east as Cedar Hill Yard in New Haven, Connecticut, without stopping. The freight route was de-electrified in 1969, and the overhead wire above the freight tracks was removed.

The passenger tracks were originally electrified using a 11 kV, 25 Hz overhead catenary traction power system, as they were part of the NH&#x27;s electrification system. Freight trains used the same 11 kV, 25 Hz traction power system when the freight tracks were electrified. After Amtrak took over the Northeast Corridor in the 1970s, it announced plans to upgrade the line to a 25 kV, 60 Hz traction power system. Ultimately, the section of track over the Hell Gate Bridge was upgraded to 12.5 kV, 60 Hz electric traction. Just south of the bridge&#x27;s Queens terminus, the Hell Gate Line transitions to Amtrak&#x27;s 12 kV, 25 Hz traction power system, as that part of the route was electrified by the PRR.

While NH trains were capable of operating on third rail power through the East River Tunnels to Penn Station, there was no third rail on the bridge. Overhead catenary poles are instead installed along the length of the Hell Gate Bridge. Power is supplied by substations along the Hell Gate Line. During the winter, the catenary wires could be defrosted by increasing the current coming from the substations.

===Fees and surcharges===
Fees were originally charged on freight trains that used the Hell Gate Bridge. For instance, in the 1910s, the New Haven Railroad charged a fee of three cents for every of cargo that was transported via the bridge, a fee that was raised to five cents after World War I.

During World War I, passengers began paying a fee on trips that used the bridge. The surcharge, imposed on all passengers who were not departing or arriving at New York Penn Station, was originally 75 cents but was raised to 90 cents in 1920. To avoid the surcharge, passengers transiting through New York City frequently chose to buy a ticket from their original departure point to Penn Station, then another from Penn Station to their destination. This prompted a complaint in 1945, in which a traveler claimed that the fee was discriminatory; an ICC examiner recommended that the PRR and NH stop charging the fee, but the ICC rejected the recommendation. The ICC launched another inquiry into the surcharge in 1951. ICC commissioner J. Monroe Johnson recommended in 1954 that the surcharge either be applied to all rail trips or be abolished entirely, but the ICC also rejected the proposal.



== Impact ==

=== Critical reception ===
When the bridge was being built, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the bridge&#x27;s abutments would dwarf the buildings on Wards Islands but that &quot;it will give the idea of lightness and symmetry as well as almost immovable strength&quot;. Hornbostel said the main span would &quot;form a veritable triumphal arch at the northerly entrance of the Port of New York&quot;, while the &quot;Railway Gazette&quot; called the project &quot;second in interest only to the Quebec Bridge&quot; due to its length. After the main arch was completed, a writer for the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; said: &quot;Perhaps never in human history has a mechanical triumph of such magnitude been launched with so little fanfare&quot;, while &quot;Outlook&quot; magazine described it as being &quot;of interest in both the scientific world and in the world of transportation&quot;. A writer for &quot;The American Architect&quot; magazine said in 1920 that &quot;there is something picturesque about the long viaduct leading to Hell Gate Bridge&quot;.

A 1972 almanac described the Hell Gate Bridge as one of 84 &quot;notable modern bridges&quot; across the world. Jeffrey Kroessler and Nina Rappaport, the authors of the 1990 book &quot;Historic Preservation in Queens&quot;, described the Hell Gate Bridge as one of 35 structures in Queens that they believed were worth designating as official New York City landmarks. At the end of the 20th century, the &quot;Engineering News-Record&quot; wrote that, &quot;Its name notwithstanding, Hell Gate Bridge over the East River in New York City is considered to be one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful bridges.&quot;

In 2004, Joe Greenstein of &quot;Trains&quot; magazine described Amtrak passengers&#x27; view from the bridge as the &quot;spectacular reward for enduring the cramped chaos of Penn Station&quot;, but that the bridge was rarely noticed by those on the ground. A writer for the same magazine called the Hell Gate Bridge &quot;one of the most impressive and important railroad structures in America&quot; in 2007. At the bridge&#x27;s centennial, Greater Astoria Historical Society director Bob Singleton called the Hell Gate Bridge &quot;a school for 20th-century bridge making&quot; and attributed the bridge&#x27;s relative obscurity to the fact that it did not accommodate vehicles or pedestrians. According to Amtrak&#x27;s deputy chief structural engineer, Jim Richter, the bridge was &quot;a great symbol of the railroad&quot;.

=== Effect on development and commerce ===

When the Hell Gate Bridge and the NYCR line were proposed, the &quot;Brooklyn Times&quot; reported that the bridge and line would shift New York City&#x27;s freight rail traffic from Manhattan to Brooklyn, and PRR president Alexander Cassatt said the project would be second only to the Panama Canal in its impact on trade. The bridge would also enable residents of towns along the New Haven railroad to commute to Penn Station, at a time when the railroad used Grand Central Terminal to access Manhattan. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; wrote in 1908 that, &quot;for the first time in the history of this city, [there will be] an all-rail route through New York between New England and the South&quot;. After work had begun, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the bridge and the NYCR line &quot;one of the greatest improvements under way toward the industrial development of Queens&quot;, while the &quot;Sun&quot; said the bridge would increase Long Island&#x27;s population and economy by making Queens into an industrial hub. The &quot;Times&quot; also predicted in 1913 that the bridge&#x27;s completion would increase real-estate values in western Queens and the South Bronx.

When the bridge was completed, various houses and other buildings were constructed underneath the bridge&#x27;s approach viaduct, particularly in Queens. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; predicted that the completion of the bridge, along with the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, would reduce shipping times to and from Brooklyn by a full day. The &quot;Railway Age Gazette&quot; similarly predicted that freight rail would benefit most from the Hell Gate Bridge. When the bridge opened, business owners negotiated for space near LIRR yards in western Queens, owing to these yards&#x27; proximity to the bridge.

=== Influence and media ===
&quot;Railway Age&quot; wrote in 1955 that the Hell Gate Bridge had signified &quot;the advent of steel arch construction&quot; for railroad bridges. Its design influenced the designs of others around the world. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, was heavily influenced by the Hell Gate Bridge. The engineer in charge of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, John Bradfield, had surveyed the Hell Gate Bridge while trying to come up with designs for the Sydney crossing. The design of the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, was derived from the Sydney Harbour Bridge and, by extension, the Hell Gate Bridge. The McKees Rocks Bridge near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was also modeled on the Hell Gate Bridge.

When the bridge was completed, the architect Hugh Ferriss drew a cover for the Queens Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s monthly magazine &quot;Queensborough&quot;, which depicted the main span. The main span was depicted in movies such as the 1973 film &quot;Serpico&quot; and the 1991 film &quot;Queens Logic&quot;, as well as TV shows such as &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;. The bridge&#x27;s name inspired the name of the 2000 film &quot;Under Hellgate Bridge&quot; by Michael Sergio. In addition, the bridge has inspired works of art such as &quot;Hell Gate&quot;, a model of the main span by the artist Chris Burden. The New York Botanical Garden&#x27;s annual Christmas train show also includes a replica of the Hell Gate Bridge. The cooperatively-owned local news site &quot;Hell Gate NYC&quot; takes its name and visual identity from the bridge.

<doc id="318698" wikidata="Q1147016" url="?curid=318698" title="Labialization">
<text>Labialization is a secondary articulatory feature of sounds in some languages. Labialized sounds involve the lips while the remainder of the oral cavity produces another sound. The term is normally restricted to consonants. When vowels involve the lips, they are called rounded.

The most common labialized consonants are labialized velars. Most other labialized sounds also have simultaneous velarization, and the process may then be more precisely called labio-velarization. The &quot;labialization&quot; of bilabial consonants often refers to protrusion instead of a secondary articulatory feature velarization. [pʷ] doesn&#x27;t mean [pˠ] although [w] refers to a labial–velar approximant. 

In phonology, labialization may also refer to a type of assimilation process.

== Occurrence ==

Labialization is the most widespread secondary articulation in the world&#x27;s languages. It is phonemically contrastive in Northwest Caucasian (e.g. Adyghe), Athabaskan, and Salishan language families, among others. This contrast is reconstructed also for Proto-Indo-European, the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages; and it survives in Latin and some Romance languages. It is also found in the Cushitic and Ethio-Semitic languages.

American English labializes to various degrees.

A few languages, including Arrernte and Mba, have contrastive labialized forms for almost all of their consonants.

In many Salishan languages, such as Klallam, velar consonants only occur in their labialized forms (except /k/, which occurs in some loanwords). However, uvular consonants occur abundantly labialized and unrounded.

==Types==
Out of 706 language inventories surveyed by , labialization occurred most often with velar (42%) and uvular (15%) segments and least often with dental and alveolar segments. With non-dorsal consonants, labialization may include velarization as well. Labialization is not restricted to lip-rounding. The following articulations have either been described as labialization or been found as allophonic realizations of prototypical labialization:

* Labiodental frication, found in Abkhaz
* Complete bilabial closure, , found in Abkhaz and Ubykh
* &quot;Labialization&quot; (, , and ) without noticeable rounding (protrusion) of the lips, found in the Iroquoian languages. It may be that they are compressed.
* Rounding without velarization, found in Shona and in the Bzyb dialect of Abkhaz.

Eastern Arrernte has labialization at all places and manners of articulation; this derives historically from adjacent rounded vowels, as is also the case of the Northwest Caucasian languages. Marshallese also has phonemic labialization as a secondary articulation at all places of articulation except for labial consonants and coronal obstruents.

In North America, languages from a number of families have sounds that sound labialized (and vowels that sound rounded) without the participation of the lips. See Tillamook language for an example.

=== Prelabialization ===
In Slovene, sounds can be prelabialized. Furthermore, the change is phonemic and all phonemes have prelabialized pairs (though not all of their allophones can have pairs). Compare &#x27;stand&#x27; and &#x27;stand up&#x27; . The prelabialization part, however, is usually not considered as being part of the same phoneme as prelabialized sound, but rather as an allophone of as it changes depending on the environment, e. g. &#x27;take&#x27; and &#x27;summarize&#x27; . See Slovene phonology for more details.

==Transcription==
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, labialization of velar consonants is indicated with a raised w modifier (Unicode U+02B7), as in . (Elsewhere this diacritic generally indicates simultaneous labialization and velarization.) There are also diacritics, respectively , to indicate greater or lesser degrees of rounding. These are normally used with vowels but may occur with consonants. For example, in the Athabaskan language Hupa, voiceless velar fricatives distinguish three degrees of labialization, transcribed either or .

The extensions to the IPA has two additional symbols for degrees of rounding: Spread and open-rounded (as in English). It also has a symbol for labiodentalized sounds, .

If precision is desired, the Abkhaz and Ubykh articulations may be transcribed with the appropriate fricative or trill raised as a diacritic: , , , .

For simple labialization, resurrected an old IPA symbol, , which would be placed above a letter with a descender such as . However, their chief example is Shona &quot;sv&quot; and &quot;zv,&quot; which they transcribe and but which actually seem to be whistled sibilants, without necessarily being labialized. Another possibility is to use the IPA diacritic for rounding, distinguishing for example the labialization in English &quot;soon&quot; and &quot;swoon&quot;. The open rounding of English is also unvelarized.

==Assimilation==
Labialization also refers to a specific type of assimilatory process where a given sound become labialized due to the influence of neighboring labial sounds. For example, may become in the environment of , or may become in the environment of or .

In the Northwest Caucasian languages as well as some Australian languages rounding has shifted from the vowels to the consonants, producing a wide range of labialized consonants and leaving in some cases only two phonemic vowels. This appears to have been the case in Ubykh and Eastern Arrernte, for example. The labial vowel sounds usually still remain, but only as allophones next to the now-labial consonant sounds.

<text>The Ganaraska River is a river in Northumberland County and the Regional Municipality of Durham in Southern Ontario, Canada. It is part of the Great Lakes Basin, and is a tributary of Lake Ontario, which it reaches at the central community of the municipality of Port Hope. The river&#x27;s name is thought to be derived from &quot;Ganaraske&quot;, the Cayuga name for the village this Iroquoian nation had established in this area in 1779. 

Together with other nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, they had migrated from New York, forced to cede their homelands because of having allied with the British in the American Revolutionary War. The Crown provided additional lands to the Iroquois peoples, including what is now called the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve.

Later the Crown granted land here to United Empire Loyalists, in compensation for their losses in the Northeast colonies, especially New York. They were the first European Americans to settle here in any number.

==Course==
The river begins on the Oak Ridges Moraine in the Ganaraska Forest in the municipality of Clarington, about southeast of the junction of Ontario Highway 35 and Ontario Highway 115. It flows southeast past the community of Kendal, takes in the left tributary North Ganaraska River, and turns south to its mouth on the north shore of Lake Ontario.

==Watershed==
Portions of the Ganaraska River drainage basin of extend into the City of Kawartha Lakes; the Township of Cavan–Monaghan, Peterborough County; and the Township of Hamilton, Northumberland County.

==Natural history==
There have been major conservation efforts in recent years.

It attracts anglers for salmon and trout. The Ganaraska River Fishway, a fish ladder, allows rainbow trout to travel up river to spawn.

==Flood of 1980==
The river had a flood in 1980, that caused considerable damage to the Port Hope downtown area.

<doc id="318702" wikidata="Q3328740" url="?curid=318702" title="Music of Pakistan">
<text>The Music of Pakistan () is a fusion of Turko-Persian, Arab, North Indian, and contemporary Western influences, creating a distinct musical tradition often referred to as &quot;Pakistani Music.&quot; The genre has adapted and evolved over time in response to shifting cultural norms and global influences. It has also been deeply shaped by Pakistan&#x27;s tumultuous political and geopolitical landscape. The Islamization policies of the 1980s, which sought to align Pakistani culture with conservative ideals of Wahhabism, imposed strict censorship on music and musical expression. This period of repression was further fueled by the ongoing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, during which Wahhabism was aggressively promoted with backing from the United States and Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to counter Soviet influence.

Although Pakistan as a nation emerged in 1947, the region it occupies has served as a historical crossroads for millennia. The Persian Empire, Turko-Persian dynasties, the Afghan Empire, Arab Caliphates, Indian dynasties, and British colonial rule, each era left defining imprints on the country&#x27;s musical traditions, leading to classical forms like &quot;qawwali&quot; and &quot;ghazal&quot;, as well as vibrant folk music reflecting the country’s ethnic diversity—Punjabis, Pashtuns, Balti, Baloch, Hazaras, Sindhis, Wakhi, Shina and more.

In the late 20th century and beyond, globalization significantly influenced Pakistani music, with elements of Western popular music merging with local traditions to create contemporary genres. Diaspora Pakistanis in the West, such as Nazia Hassan, Zayn Malik (One Direction), Nadia Ali, and Annie Khalid, played a crucial role in introducing modern music to the Pakistani music scene. Their music resonated with younger Pakistani audiences, who saw in their success a representation of their own identity on the global stage, particularly at a time when that identity was under threat during the period of Islamization in Pakistan.

As of 2015, EMI Pakistan is the country&#x27;s biggest record label, holding the licenses of some 60,000 Pakistani artists and around 70% of the total music of the country, while streaming service Patari has the largest independent digital collection, with some 3,000 artists and 50,000 songs.

== Pre-history ==

Pakistan boasts a rich and ancient history of music, with some of the earliest evidence traced back to the Indus Valley civilisation (c. 3300–1300 BCE), one of the world&#x27;s oldest urban cultures. Among the notable artifacts from this period is the Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daro (2300–1751 BC), a bronze sculpture discovered in the ancient city of Mohenjo-daro, located in present-day Pakistan. The sculpture, depicting a young female figure poised mid-motion, is widely believed by scholars to symbolize ritualistic or celebratory dance, likely performed to the accompaniment of music.

Other archaeological findings, including seals depicting musical instruments like flutes, drums, and stringed instruments, indicate that the Indus Valley people likely had a rich musical tradition. The legacy of this early musical culture continued to evolve through various dynasties and empires that ruled the region.

==Traditional music==
Pakistan, located in South-Central Asia, is home to a wide array of ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups. The country’s traditional music reflects this diversity, with each ethnic group contributing unique styles and forms. At the same time, Pakistan&#x27;s music scene has also seen the development of musical forms born from the fusion of various influences, such as &quot;Qawwali&quot; and &quot;Ghazal&quot;, which blend traditional, regional, and Sufi elements.

=== Folk Music ===
Pakistan has diverse folk traditions, with each region reflecting its local culture and language through its musical traditions. These folk traditions are passed down through generations and often form the core of community events, rituals, and festivals, typically celebrating themes of village life, nature, bravery, spirituality, love, longing and separation. Some of the famous folk singers/bands of Pakistan include Zarsanga, Sanam Marvi, Nazia Iqbal, Gul Panra, Raheem Shah, Saieen Zahoor, Abida Parveen, Ghazala Javed, Tina Sani, Musarrat Nazir, Tahira Syed, Laila Khan, Naheed Akhtar, Zeb Bangash, Suraiya Multanikar, Allan Fakir, Alam Lohar, Hadiqa Kiani, Ali Zafar, Haroon Bacha, and Khumarian.

In Pakistan&#x27;s rural areas and ethnic communities, bards continue to perform traditional folk music, preserving ancient songs and cultural customs. In the Pashtun community, &quot;ashiqs&quot; or &quot;barkhurdars&quot; are traditional bards who sing epic tales of &quot;Pashtunwali&quot; (the Pashtun code of honor), recounting historical battles, and the lives of famous warriors. In Balochistan, &quot;Ghazaks&quot; (Balochi bards) perform songs about historical figures, social struggles, and regional issues, often accompanied by the &quot;dambura&quot;, a stringed instrument. Similarly, in Sindh, bards continue to preserve and perform the poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai and other Sufi mystics, traveling between shrines and festivals.

Some of the major folk traditions of Pakistan include:

==== Pashto music ====
Pashto music is predominantly found in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and in major urban centers of Pakistan, including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Karachi. There is a long oral tradition of Pashto folk music, which includes genres such as the Tappa, Charbeta, Neemkai, Loba, Shaan and Badala.

The Tappa is considered one of the oldest forms of Pashto poetry, consisting of two unequal meters, with the second being longer than the first. Charbeta is another highly popular form of Pashto poetry, often epic in nature, focusing on heroic figures and events. It is typically performed at a fast tempo by two or more singers. Neemkai is a type of folk song usually composed by Pashto women, expressing themes drawn from daily life and personal experiences.

Loba is a dramatic form of Pashto folk song, often a dialogue that tells romantic stories or allegorical tales. Shaan is a celebratory song performed during significant life events, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Badala, is an epic poem set to music and accompanied by instruments like the harmonium, drums, and tabla. Although it is a form of folk music, it is typically performed by professional musicians.

==== Sindhi music ====

Sindhi music is traditionally performed in two primary styles: Baits and Waee. The Baits style is a form of vocal music, characterized by two variations: Sanhoon (low voice) and Graham (high voice). On the other hand, Waee is primarily instrumental and often involves the use of string instruments. Waee music is also referred to as Kafi and is widely found in the surrounding regions of Balochistan and Punjab. Common instruments used in Sindhi regional music include the Yaktaro (a one-string instrument), Narr (a type of flute), and Naghara (a drum). The themes in Sindhi music often center around Sufism and mysticism.

==== Balti music ====
According to Balti folklore, Mughal princess Gul Khatoon (known in Baltistan as Mindoq Gialmo—Flower Queen) brought musicians and artisans with her into the region and they propagated Mughal music and art under her patronage. Musical instruments such as the &quot;surnai&quot;, &quot;karnai&quot;, &quot;dhol&quot; and &quot;chang&quot; were introduced into Baltistan. Classical and other dances are classified as sword dances, &quot;broqchhos&quot; and Yakkha and &quot;ghazal&quot; dances. &quot;Chhogho Prasul&quot; commemorates a victory by the Maqpon &quot;rajas&quot;. As a mark of respect, the musician who plays the drum (&quot;dang&quot;) plays for a long time. A Maqpon princess would occasionally dance to this tune. &quot;Gasho-Pa&quot;, also known as &quot;Ghbus-La-Khorba&quot;, is a sword dance associated with the Gasho Dynasty of Purik (Kargil). &quot;Sneopa&quot;, the marriage-procession dance by &quot;pachones&quot; (twelve &quot;wazirs&quot; who accompany the bride), is performed at the marriage of a &quot;raja&quot;.

==== Balochi music ====
Balochi music, primarily found in the Pakistani province of Balochistan, is a diverse and rich tradition shaped by the region&#x27;s variety of languages, including Balochi, Persian, Pashto, Brahui, Sindhi, Dari and Saraiki. Common instruments used in Balochi music include the Suroz, Donali, and benju. Notable musical forms in Balochi culture include Sepad, Shabtagi, Vazbad, Lullaby, and Zayirak, which are performed in various rituals, such as those following the birth of a child, while lullabies are sung to soothe infants and children.

==== Shina music ====
Shina is the predominant language found in Pakistan&#x27;s northern areas of Gilgit and Baltistan. The language has an extensive oral history which dates back several thousand years. With the increase in tourism to the northern areas and increased domestic as well as international awareness of the local folk music, the Shina folk traditions have managed to stay alive and vibrant. Folk music in this region has remained relatively pure and unscathed by modern influences due to the relative isolation of this area. The arrival of many refugees from the adjacent Nuristan province of Afghanistan and the subsequent increase in commercial activity in Chitrali bazaars allowed this local form of music to furthernflourish in the past few decades.

==== Punjabi music ====

Folk music from the Punjab province is rich and varied, showcasing a range of instruments such as the dhol (a large drum), flute, dholak (a smaller drum), and tumbi (a single-stringed instrument). The folk music invokes the traditions and tells stories of agricultural life, love, and joy. Famous folklores, such as that of &quot;Sassi Punnu&quot; set in the historic city of Bhanbhore (Sindh) and the coastal regions of Makran (Balochistan), are often the poetic content of Punjabi folk music.

=== Qawwali ===

One of the most notable genres of traditional Pakistani music is &quot;Qawwali (, , )&quot;, a devotional musical form primarily performed in Urdu, Persian, or Punjabi. A key characteristic of Qawwali is its emphasis on improvisation and lyrics derived from Sufi poetry, often expressing themes of divine love, longing, and spiritual devotion. In recent decades, however, Qawwali has increasingly incorporated secular themes into its repertoire.

Amir Khusrau, a prominent figure of the Chisti order of Sufis, is credited with creating Qawwali by blending Turkish, Persian, Arabic, and North Indian musical traditions in the late 13th century. The word &quot;Qawwali&quot; is derived from the Arabic term &quot;Qawl&quot; (), meaning &quot;saying&quot; or &quot;utterance.&quot; A session of Qawwali is formally referred to as &quot;&quot;Mehfil-e-Sama,&quot; as it is considered a form of Sama (Turkish: &quot;Sema&quot;;  Persian, Urdu and Persian: سَماع, &quot;samā‘un&quot;), a Sufi tradition performed as part of the meditation and prayer practice known as dhikr. In Central Asia and Turkey, the word &quot;Sama&quot;&quot; is used (or is preferred) for musical forms that closely resemble Qawwali.

Qawwali music is performed by a group of about nine musicians, called &quot;Humnawa&quot; () led by a principal singer. The performance incorporates various musical instruments alongside hand clapping by the singers. Common instruments used in Qawwali include the Harmonium, Tabla, Rubab, Sitar, Sarangi, and Tanpura.

Qawwali gained international acclaim through the legendary artist Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, often hailed as &quot;Shahenshah-e-Qawwali&quot; (). In 2016, LA Weekly ranked Khan as the fourth greatest singer of all time. One of his most celebrated albums, Night Song, produced in collaboration with Michael Brook, reached number 4 on the Billboard Top World Music Albums chart in 1996 and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album in 1997.

===Ghazal ===
The &quot;ghazal&quot; (, ) is a form of poetry consisting of couplets which share a rhyme and a refrain, with both lines of the opening couplet and the second line of each subsequent couplet adhering to the same meter. Etymologically, the word &quot;ghazal&quot; () originates from Arabic, where it means &quot;to flirt,&quot; and often denotes themes of love and longing in Arabic poetry. In the Persianate world, the term acquired additional symbolic meaning, being associated with the &quot;mortal cry of a gazelle&quot;—based on the Persian word &quot;ghazāl&quot; (), from which the English word &quot;gazelle&quot; stems. The cry of a gazelle when hunted became a metaphor for the pain, separation, and yearning central to the ghazal&#x27;s themes. The name &quot;ghazal&quot; encapsulates its dual essence: the tender, often melancholic exploration of love, loss, and existential musings, alongside its lyrical and rhythmic beauty, evoking the elegance and grace of the gazelle.While traditionally rooted in poetry, the ghazal in Pakistan has evolved to become closely associated with music. This transformation began in the early 20th century when the recording industry played a key role in popularizing the musical adaptation of Urdu and Persian ghazals, making the works of renowned poets like Rumi, Hafez, Mirza Ghalib, Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Ahmed Faraz, and Parveen Shakir accessible to a wider audience. Ghazal music originally adhered to the Hindustani (North Indian) classical tradition, employing ragas (melodic modes) and talas (rhythmic cycles), typically at a slow, contemplative tempo. In modern times, however, ghazals have seen a fusion with genres such as light classical, jazz, rock, or pop music, resulting in a more contemporary sound that retains the lyrical beauty of its origins.
==Modern music==
The song &quot;Ko Ko Korina&quot; (Urdu: کوکوکورینا) sung by Ahmed Rushdi in 1966 is considered to be the first pop song of Pakistan. Rushdi was born in present day India in 1934, where he started his musical career, but later migrated to Pakistan in 1954. Pop music in Pakistan truly gained momentum during the 1980s with the brother-sister duo Nazia and Zoheb Hassan. Their debut album, &quot;Disco Deewane&quot; (), released in 1981, broke sales records in Pakistan and became the best-selling Asian pop album at the time. It topped charts in India, Russia, South Africa, Latin America, and Philippines, and earned international acclaim.

Another popular act of the 1980s was the pop and rock band &quot;Vital Signs&quot;, with Junaid Jamshed as the vocalist and Rohail Hyatt as the keyboardist. From the 1980s to the 1990s, they produced many of their highly successful and critically praised albums. Their song &quot;Dil Dil Pakistan&quot; was voted as the third most popular song of all time by a BBC World poll in 2003.

However, the 1980s were also the time of rapid political change in Pakistan, driven by the Islamization policies of President Muhammad Zia Ul Haq, who came to power through a coup d&#x27;état in 1977. Under the banner of Nizam-e-Mustafa (), Zia&#x27;s regime sought to implement a conservative Islamic agenda, which came with strict bans and restrictions on musical expression across the country. Even the song &quot;Dil Dil Pakistan&quot; by Vital Signs, despite being a patriotic anthem—typically the kind of music that thrives under autocratic regimes—got censored for showing young men in Western clothing. President Zia Ul Haq had strongly denounced &quot;western ideas&quot; such as jeans and rock music. The regime also banned music for reasons such as &quot;endorsing alcohol consumption&quot; if lyrics mentioned alcohol, or &quot;obscenity&quot; if a male and female were shown standing close or dancing. This period also saw the closure of all bars, nightclubs, and theater halls in the country, depriving aspiring musicians and bands of venues to perform and earn a living.

The Islamization regime of Zia Ul Haq in Pakistan coincided with the broader rise of conservative movements across the Greater Middle East, including the Islamic Revolution (1979) in neighboring Iran, the Soviet invasion of neighboring Afghanistan (1979), and the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990)—all of which strengthened the role of the clergy and fueled sectarian tensions throughout the region. Of particular relevance to Pakistan was the Soviet-Afghan War, in which Pakistan played a direct role as an ally in the U.S.-led &quot;Operation Cyclone&quot; to expel Soviet forces from Afghanistan. As part of this operation, Saudi Arabia arranged the transport of thousands of young, indoctrinated volunteers, known as &quot;Afghan Arabs,&quot; from across the Middle East to Pakistan. There, they were trained and equipped with U.S.-provided arms before being sent into Afghanistan to fight against Soviet forces. Additionally, Saudi Arabia funded the establishment of thousands of madrassahs in Pakistan, with their number growing from about 900 in 1971 to over 33,000 in 1988. These madrassahs promoted Wahhabi ideology, seeking to radicalize Afghan refugees and impoverished local populations to join the &quot;jihad&quot; () against the Soviets in Afghanistan. However, these radicalized youths also launched a campaign inside Pakistan against music, which is considered impermissible under Wahhabi doctrine. Many musicians were threatened with violence unless they abandoned their craft or left the country. This fervor escalated into acts of violence, including the burning of record shops and attacks on art exhibitions and musical performances.

=== Pop music ===
Despite the crackdown on music during the Islamization regime, Pakistani music continued to evolve, often thriving in underground performances, through the efforts of diaspora communities, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, and through artists at home who continued to defy the regime. In the 1980s and 1990s, pop acts like Nazia Hassan, Zoheb Hassan, Vital Signs, Strings, and Nermin Niazi gained widespread popularity, defining a new era of Pakistani pop music. The 1990s also saw the rise of rock and fusion bands such as Junoon, Aaroh, and Noori, which became household names and enjoyed immense popularity. By the early 2000s, a fresh wave of pop acts has emerged, including Ali Zafar, Momina Mustehsan, Zoe Viccaji, Hadiqa Kiani, Aima Baig, Awaz (Haroon, Faakhir Mehmood), and Jal.

=== Rock music ===
The rise of rock music in Pakistan began in the 1980s when cassettes first came into Pakistan bringing in a wave of Western rock music, particularly groups such as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and AC/DC. Despite the restrictive environment of the Islamization era, which sought to suppress Western cultural influences, underground rock concerts began to flourish across the country. Rock bands Vital Signs and Strings rose in defiance of the regime and gained immense popularity amongst the youth. Vital Signs is widely regarded as Pakistan&#x27;s first and most successful pop rock band. Strings gained widespread acclaim following the release of their second album in 1992, eventually selling over 25 million albums worldwide. The 1990s saw the rise of other notable bands, including Junoon, Aaroh, and Noori. Junoon pioneered the genre of Sufi rock, combining the poetry of famous Sufi poets such as Rumi, Hafez, and Bulleh Shah with the hard rock brand of Led Zeppelin and Santana and classical instruments such as the tabla. Junoon is one of Pakistan&#x27;s and South-Central Asia&#x27;s most successful bands with over 30 million albums sold worldwide; the New York Times called Junoon &quot;the U2 of Pakistan&quot; and Q magazine dubbed them as &quot;One of the biggest bands in the world&quot;. Junoon became the first rock band to perform at the United Nations General Assembly Hall and only the second Pakistani act to perform at a Nobel Peace Prize Concert.
The early 2000s saw the arrival of progressive metal, progressive rock, and psychedelic rock with bands such as Entity Paradigm and Mizraab. Qayaas, Call, Roxen, Jal, Mizmaar, Karavan, and Mekaal Hasan Band also exploded onto the music scene with different brands of rock including alternative and soft rock. The television series Pepsi Battle of the Bands was instrumental in launching Entity Paradigm, Aaroh, and the Mekaal Hasan Band, all of whom competed in the inaugural edition of the show in 2002. After a 15-year hiatus, the series resumed in 2017, introducing new bands to the rock scene, such as Kashmir, Bayaan, and Badnaam.

Although the heavy metal genre began to rise in popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, its roots can be traced back to the influence of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) of the late 1970s and 1980s. Early pioneers of Pakistani heavy metal included bands like &quot;Black Warrant&quot;, &quot;Final Cut&quot;, and &quot;Barbarians&quot;. Since then, a number of heavy and black metal bands have emerged, including Overload, Saturn, Saakin, Karakoram, Burq - The Band, Taarma, The Nuke, and Aag.
=== Patriotic and political music ===

Patriotic music in Pakistan has long played a significant role in shaping the national identity and reflecting the country’s spirit. Early iconic songs, such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan&#x27;s &quot;Mera Paigham Pakistan&quot;, Vital Signs&#x27; &quot;Dil Dil Pakistan&quot;, Awaz&#x27;s &quot;Ay Jawan&quot;, and Shabana Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Aye Gul-e-Yasmeen&quot;, became anthems that resonated with the nation&#x27;s pride and sense of unity.

Political music in Pakistan also extends beyond fostering national pride, frequently veering into propaganda. Pakistani military&#x27;s media arm, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), colloquially referred to as the &quot;propaganda house&quot; in the country, regularly produces and sponsors music that glorifies the military. The military has a long history of overthrowing democratic governments, which has contributed to civilian mistrust, with confidence in the institution remaining among the lowest in the world. ISPR uses music and other forms of media to shape and whitewash the military’s image, and deflect attention from ongoing allegations of corruption, election rigging, human rights abuses, and oppression. ISPR productions frequently use emotional imagery and lyrics to frame dissent and criticism of the military as an attack on personnel who are on the frontlines, sacrificing their lives for the nation’s security and well-being.

In addition to state-sponsored patriotic music, political parties in Pakistan have also harnessed the power of music to rally their supporters. Political songs are regularly featured during rallies, gatherings, and protests to energize crowds. At the same time, music serves as a powerful tool for activism and resistance. Songs such as &quot;Intebah&quot; by Saakin, &quot;Mori Araj Suno&quot; by Tina Sani (based on Faiz Ahmed Faiz&#x27;s poetry), and &quot;Wajood-e-Zan&quot; by Natasha Noorani (based on Allama Iqbal&#x27;s poetry) have become iconic in Pakistan&#x27;s activism culture, representing dissent and resistance to political injustice.

== Loss of musical identity and attempts at revival ==

In the decades following the Islamization regime, restrictions on music in Pakistan eased somewhat, and the rise of the internet opened new avenues for sharing and accessing music. This shift has contributed to a considerable resurgence in the country’s domestic music scene. However, many feel that the music of today diverges significantly from its pre-Islamization roots, with much of Pakistan’s distinctive musical identity—a fusion of Turko-Persian, Western, North Indian, and Arab influences—now largely absent.

The erosion of this identity began during the Islamization period, when local music industries were systematically dismantled. This created a cultural void that foreign music sought to fill. However, at the same time, music industries throughout the Greater Middle East, particularly in Iran, Lebanon, and Afghanistan, were also being dismantled by Islamization movements and ongoing conflicts, leaving these industries unable to fill the gap. Meanwhile, Western music was heavily censored to prevent the spread of Western values, which left the Pakistani music market wide open for India’s rapidly growing Bollywood industry to dominate.

With limited exposure to other musical traditions, generations of Pakistanis grew up immersed largely in Bollywood’s melodies, leading to a gradual cultural shift. By the 2000s, as Pakistan’s domestic music industry began to reemerge, it found itself catering to an audience attuned to Bollywood&#x27;s sound and style. As a result, many Pakistani artists and studios embraced a process of “Bollywood-ification” to remain relevant, often at the expense of the rich musical heritage that once defined the country’s unique sound.

=== Coke Studio Pakistan ===

Coke Studio Pakistan, a music television series, aimed to revive the blended identity of Pakistani music. The first season mainly featured live-recorded performances of pop and rock songs. From Season 2 onward, the show began emphasizing Pakistan&#x27;s original musical identity, while also evolving by fusing in more contemporary Western influences—a trend that became more prominent in Seasons 3, 5, and 6. As the show&#x27;s founder and director, Rohail Hyatt, described, the aim was to &quot;promote Pakistan&#x27;s folk, classical, and indigenous music by merging it with more popular or mainstream music.&quot; However, after Hyatt&#x27;s departure at the end of Season 6, the show took a different direction. From Season 7 onward, Coke Studio shifted to a more mainstream style, increasingly incorporating more visual communicating and Lollywood influences to attract a wider audience. This shift also expanded Coke Studio’s appeal in India, with viewership from Indian audiences surpassing that of Pakistan on platforms like YouTube and streaming services.

<text>The K Foundation was an art foundation set up by Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond, formerly of The KLF, in 1993, following their &#x27;retirement&#x27; from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo&#x27;s post-retirement KLF income. Between 1993 and 1995, they spent this money in a number of ways, including on a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world, focusing in particular on the Turner Prize. Most notoriously, when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through, they burned a million pounds in cash.

The K Foundation announced a 23-year on all projects from November 1995. They further indicated that they would not speak about the burning of the million pounds during the period of this moratorium.

==Context==
In the early 1980s, British musician and artist Jimmy Cauty was the guitarist in an underachieving pop/rock band, Brilliant. Brilliant had been signed to WEA Records by A&amp;R man Bill Drummond, formerly a member of the Liverpool group Big in Japan, the manager of The Teardrop Explodes and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and co-founder of the independent record label Zoo Records. In 1986, Brilliant released their one and only album - &quot;Kiss The Lips Of Life&quot; - before splitting up. In the same year, Drummond left WEA Records to record a solo album. Whilst out walking on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1987, Drummond hit upon an idea for a hip-hop record but, he said, knowing &quot;nothing, personally, about the technology&quot;, he needed a collaborator. Drummond called Jimmy Cauty who agreed to join him in a new band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu (The JAMs).

The JAMs&#x27; debut release, the single &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, was released as an underground white label on 9 March 1987. By 1991, the duo—now calling themselves The KLF—had become the best-selling singles band in the world and, according to the &quot;Allmusic&quot;, were &quot;on the verge of becoming superstars&quot;. Instead, in May 1992 they machine-gunned a music industry audience at the BRIT Awards (albeit with blanks) and quit the music business.

By their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money that they made as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions. Cauty told an Australian &quot;Big Issue&quot; writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent, and that the royalties they accrued post-retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds:
Although the duo had deleted their back catalogue in the UK with immediate effect, international licensees retained the contractual right to distribute KLF recordings for a number of years. The KLF, like any other artist, were also entitled to Performing Right Society royalties every time one of their songs was played on the radio or television. Rather than spend these earnings or invest them for personal gain, the duo decided the money would be used to fund a new art foundation - The K Foundation. &quot;Having created an artistic machine that created money&quot;, said &quot;GQ&quot; Magazine, &quot;they [then] invented a machine for destroying it.&quot; Quite what the Foundation, this money-destroying machine, would do with the million pounds plus was still undecided.

Music journalist Sarah Champion pointed out (prior to the million pound fire) that, &quot;Being &#x27;in the money&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll ever be rich. [Drummond and Cauty will] always be , but their pranks will get more extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they&#x27;d blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned.&quot; &quot;There are things we&#x27;d like to do which we haven&#x27;t done.&quot;, Drummond told a journalist in 1991. &quot;Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, but I feel confident that in the event of us selling ten million albums we would definitely go out and buy a submarine...Just to be able to say &#x27;Look we&#x27;ve got a submarine and 808 State haven&#x27;t&#x27;.&quot;

==K Foundation adverts==
The first manifestation of the K Foundation was a series of adverts in UK national newspapers in 1993. The first adverts, in July 1993, were cryptic, referring to &quot;K Time&quot; and advising readers to &quot;Kick out the clocks&quot;. There was also an advert for their single &quot;K Cera Cera&quot; which was &quot;Available nowhere ... no formats&quot; and which was not planned for release until world peace was established. The single was eventually released, but only in Israel.

&quot;When the first in a strange series of full-page ads appeared in The Independent on July 4&quot;, said &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;people started whispering. The cultish rhetoric, the unfathomable &quot;Divide and Kreate&quot; slogans, the K symbols, all suggested that the kings of cultural anarchy were back.&quot; Each advert cost between £5,000 and £15,000.

==Turner Prize subversion==
The 1994 K Foundation award was an award given by the K Foundation to the &quot;worst artist of the year&quot;.
The Foundation commissioned more press adverts, instructing readers to &quot;Abandon all art now&quot; and then inviting them to vote for the worst artist of the year. The 1993 Turner Prize was being judged at the same time, and, perhaps not coincidentally, both awards had the same shortlist of four artists. The prize being offered by Drummond and Cauty was £40,000 which was double the £20,000 offered for the Turner Prize.

Channel 4 Television broadcast coverage of the Turner Prize, during which three more K Foundation adverts were broadcast — these announced the &quot;amending of art history&quot;. During the evening, Rachel Whiteread was announced as the winner of both the Turner Prize and the K Foundation award. Whiteread initially refused to accept the K Foundation prize, but after being told that the money would be incinerated, she reluctantly accepted, with the intention of donating £30,000 to artists in financial need and the other £10,000 to the housing charity, Shelter.

==&quot;Money: A Major Body of Cash&quot;==
During the buildup to the presentation of the K Foundation art award to Rachel Whiteread on 23 November 1993, the K Foundation presented their first artwork to the press. &quot;Nailed To A Wall&quot;, &quot;the first of a series of K Foundation art installations that will also include one million pounds in a skip, one million pounds on a table and several variants on the theme of Tremendous Amounts Of Folding&quot;, consisted of one million pounds in £50 notes, nailed to a large framed board. &quot;Nailed To A Wall&quot; had a reserve price of £500,000, half the face value of the cash used in its construction, which &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;&#x27;s reporter Robert Dawson Scott was &quot;fairly confident... really was £1 million [in cash]&quot;. The catalogue entry for the artwork stated: &quot;Over the years the face value will be eroded by inflation, while the artistic value will rise and rise. The precise point at which the artistic value will overtake the face value is unknown. Deconstruct the work now and you double your money. Hang it on a wall and watch the face value erode, the market value fluctuate, and the artistic value soar. The choice is yours.&quot;

Collectively, the K Foundation&#x27;s money-as-art works were titled &quot;Money: A Major Body Of Cash&quot;, &quot;seven pieces, all involving various amounts of cash nailed to, tied to or simply standing on inanimate objects&quot;. &quot;The Face&quot; magazine neatly summed up the concepts behind the art project:

During the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging &quot;Money: A Major Body Of Cash&quot;. However, even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. &quot;&#x27;The Tate, in Liverpool, wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I&#x27;m involved with,&#x27; says Casey. &#x27;I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.&#x27; A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation&#x27;s exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly&quot;, leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. Then an exhibition at Dublin&#x27;s Kilmainham Jail was considered. No sooner had a provisional date of August been set for the exhibition, however, when the duo changed their minds yet again. &quot;Jimmy said: &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we just burn it?&#x27; remembers Drummond. &#x27;He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I&#x27;d say: &#x27;No, we can&#x27;t do that, let&#x27;s do this...&#x27; But it seemed the most powerful thing to do.&quot; Cauty: &quot;We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare.&quot;

==&quot;The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot;==

On 23 August 1994, in a boathouse on the Scottish island of Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated £1,000,000 in cash. The burning was witnessed by an old friend of Drummond&#x27;s, freelance journalist Jim Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the ceremony for &quot;The Observer&quot;. It was filmed on Hi-8 by their friend Gimpo.

Reid admitted to first feeling shock and guilt about the burning, which quickly turned to boredom. The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £50 notes into the fire. Drummond later said that only about £900,000 of the money was actually burnt – the rest flew straight up the chimney. The press reported that an islander handed £1,500 into the police; the money had not been claimed and would be returned to the finder.

On 23 August 1995, exactly one year after the burning, Drummond and Cauty returned to Jura for the premiere screening of the film, now known as &quot;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot;. The film was then toured around the UK over the next few months (plus one showing in Belgrade), with a Q&amp;A session at the end of each screening where members of the audience asked Drummond and Cauty why they burnt the money and also offered their own interpretations.

==K Cera Cera and The Magnificent==
The only music release to bear the name of the K Foundation was &quot;K Cera Cera&quot;, released as a limited edition single in Israel and Palestine in November 1993. An amalgam of &quot;Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)&quot; and John Lennon/Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;, it was credited to the &quot;K Foundation presents The Red Army Choir&quot;. Originally intended for release when &quot;world peace [is] established&quot; (i.e. never) and in &quot;no formats&quot;, the Israeli release was made &quot;In acknowledgement of the recent brave steps taken by the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO)&quot;. Said Drummond: &quot;Our idea was to create awareness of peace in the world. Because we were worried it would be interpreted by the public as an attempt by The KLF to return to the music world on the back of a humanist gimmick, we decided to hide behind the Foundation.&quot;

Also made by the duo during the K Foundation&#x27;s existence, reported by the &quot;NME&quot; as a K Foundation work, but officially attributed to &quot;The One World Orchestra featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children&#x27;s Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards&quot;, was &quot;The Magnificent&quot;, their contribution to the charity album &quot;Help&quot;. The song, a drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass version of the theme tune from &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92, was recorded on 4 September 1995. On 5 September 1995, Drummond and Cauty claimed they would &quot;never make any more records&quot;. Drummond said, &quot;What do you expect us to do, go and make a jungle record?&quot;; Cauty added &quot;Yeah, like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something. It would just be sad wouldn&#x27;t it? We&#x27;re too old.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; gleefully informed their readers, &quot;The K Foundation&#x27;s contribution to the &#x27;Help&#x27; LP is a jungle track.&quot; &quot;Help&quot; was released on 9 September 1995.

==Moratorium==
Drummond and Cauty announced a on K Foundation activities in the obscure &quot;The Workshop for Non-linear Architecture&quot; bulletin of November 1995. The duo had signed a &quot;contract&quot;, agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years. The document was signed on the bonnet of a rented car which, they claim, they then pushed over the cliffs at Cape Wrath. This was followed on 8 December 1995 by an advertisement in &quot;The Guardian&quot;:

The final act of the K Foundation was distributing a van load of Tennent&#x27;s Super - a high-alcohol-content lager - to London&#x27;s street drinkers on Christmas Day 1995. However, the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near Waterloo station on the South Bank — was unusually devoid of homeless people, many of whom were in homeless shelters for the day. &quot;That was a pity&quot;, said Jimmy Cauty. &quot;If you are down-and-out, would you rather have a bowl of soup or a can of Tennent&#x27;s?&quot; &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; later called the scheme &quot;ethically dubious&quot;.

Drummond and Cauty - reunited as The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu under the auspices of K2 Plant Hire Ltd - ended the moratorium on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning. &quot;Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?&quot; was debated during a three-day festival celebrating the launch of their novel &quot;2023: A Trilogy&quot;. In the intervening period, the duo had worked together in 1997, when they attempted to &quot;Fuck the Millennium&quot; as 2K (music) and K2 Plant Hire (conceptual art).

==&quot;Omnibus&quot; documentary==
In November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the &quot;Omnibus&quot; documentary series about The K Foundation entitled &quot;A Foundation Course in Art&quot;.

<text>Northumberland County is a county situated on the north shore of Lake Ontario, east of Toronto in Central Ontario, Canada. The Northumberland County headquarters are located in Cobourg.

==Municipalities==
Northumberland County consists of seven municipalities:
The Alderville First Nation is geographically located within the County and is a part of the Northumberland census division, but, as an Indian reserve, it is independent of county administration.

==History==
The County was first established in 1792, and was organized alongside neighbouring Durham County into the Newcastle District of Upper Canada in 1802. The County was initially settled by a mix of Irish, Scottish, and English immigrants, as well as by Americans immigrating north from New England.

In 1850, the Newcastle District was reorganized into the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham, an arrangement which lasted until 1973. Effective January 1, 1974, the majority of Durham County was amalgamated with Ontario County to create the Regional Municipality of Durham. The Township of Hope and the Town of Port Hope were transferred to Northumberland, which reverted to a standalone county.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Northumberland County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Recreation==

There are two provincial parks in Northumberland County: Presqu&#x27;ile Provincial Park in Brighton, and Ferris Provincial Park in Campbellford. There are also several other protected natural areas and forests, including Ganaraska Forest, Northumberland County Forest, Goodrich-Loomis Conservation Area, and Peter&#x27;s Woods. Waterfront campsites and cottages are located along Lake Ontario and Rice Lake.

Northumberland County has various cycling, hiking and other outdoor trails. The Waterfront Trail along Lake Ontario passes through Northumberland County, as does the Trans-Canada Trail. The Northumberland portion of the Trans-Canada Trail spans from Hastings to Hoard&#x27;s Station in Campbellford, following an abandoned rail line. Halfway through Campbellford, the trail joins the 6 km long Rotary Trail situated alongside the Trent River. There are five signed bike routes: Glorious Ganaraska, Rice Lake Ramble, Shelter Valley, Presqu’ile Promise and Trent River Truckin&#x27;. The Northumberland County Forest offers various trails available for hiking, cycling, horseback riding, ATVing, off-road motorcycling, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, snowshoeing as well as a 3.2 km, accessible Universal Trail. The Ganaraska Hiking Trail starts in Port Hope and goes north towards the Bruce Trail.

There are three theatres in Northumberland County: Westben in Campbellford, the Capitol Theatre in Port Hope, and the Park Theatre &amp; Performing Arts Centre in Cobourg. Festivals in Northumberland include the Warkworth Maple Syrup and Float Your Fanny Down the Ganny festivals in early spring, the Cobourg Sandcastle Festival and Incredible Edibles Festival in the summer, and the Cultivate Food and Vintage Film Festivals in the fall.

<doc id="318711" wikidata="Q1136714" url="?curid=318711" title="Scott Base">
<text>Scott Base is a New Zealand Antarctic research station at Pram Point on Ross Island near Mount Erebus in New Zealand&#x27;s Ross Dependency territorial claim. It was named in honour of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, RN, leader of two British expeditions to the Ross Sea area of Antarctica. The base was set up as support to field research and the centre for research into earth sciences, and now conducts research in many fields, operated by Antarctica New Zealand.

The base is from the larger U.S. McMurdo Station via Willy Field road, the main road to Williams Field.

==History==


Scott Base was originally constructed in support of the UK inspired and privately managed Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (TAE). The New Zealand government provided support for the TAE and also for the International Geophysical Year (IGY) project of 1957, five of whose members were attached to the Expedition. In February 1956, 10 months before the TAE and IGY parties were due to head to the Antarctic, Frank Ponder, an architect at the Ministry of Works (New Zealand), was given the task of designing the base. Ponder&#x27;s design consisted of six main buildings and three smaller scientific labs. The main buildings were to be placed at least 7 metres apart because of fire risk but were linked to one another by a covered way of galvanised iron. Three New Zealand observers who were also given the task of selecting the site for a base went to McMurdo Sound with the United States &quot;Operation Deep Freeze I&quot; in the summer of 1955. After evaluating possible sites, a location near Butter Point was chosen. This was later changed to Pram Point as it provided better access for offloading supplies from the Expedition ship HMNZS &quot;Endeavour&quot; and also allowed for the operation of the critical RNZAF Antarctic Flight on a nearby ice runway. The base looks out over what is now known as Haskell Strait. Scott Base passed over to New Zealand Government ownership via the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), on 5 March 1958, at the conclusion of the TAE.
During the IGY the United States facility at Hut Point did not operate as a scientific base. It was the New Zealand expedition’s responsibility to furnish the important scientific data (auroral, ionospheric, seismic, etc.), linking the McMurdo area research activities with those of the United States Pole Station and the joint United States–New Zealand station at Cape Hallett, Victoria Land.

===Scientific research and expansion===
In 1958, following completion of the TAE and IGY, New Zealand made the decision to continue to operate Scott Base for scientific research, much of which depends upon the continuity of recorded data over a period of years. In order to maintain operations, a base rebuilding programme began in 1976. As of 2008, the only original building is the TAE &#x27;A&#x27; mess hut, which contains material recording New Zealand&#x27;s involvement in Antarctica since 1957. In 2005 the two-story high Hillary Field Centre was commissioned, increasing the floor area of Scott Base by 1800 square metres and providing work areas to support field parties as well as additional office space. The building was officially opened by then-Foreign Minister Phil Goff and Sir Edmund Hillary.

The leader of Scott Base for the 1964–65 season, Adrian Hayter, published a personal memoir of his experience. He was preceded as Leader by Russell Rawle and followed by Mike Prebble. These three leaders are commemorated with Rawle Glacier, Mount Hayter and Prebble Glacier, assuming the leader in 1965–66 was on the base support party of 1961–62.

From 1957 until 1986, dogs played a part in base operations. Initially, they were an essential means of transport, but with better technology, their importance dwindled until they were removed in line with environmental treaties.

Scientific diving operations began in 1985. Between 1985 and 2006, a total of 1,296 had been logged.

===21st century redevelopment===

In support of the future of New Zealand’s Antarctic science programme, the base will be redeveloped. In June 2019 the Government committed NZ$18.5 million (US$12.4 million) for the next phase of the Scott Base Redevelopment project, which will see the base&#x27;s 12 separate buildings replaced by three large interconnected buildings. Jasmax and Hugh Broughton Architects came up with the architectural design. Since then the New Zealand Government has committed $344 million to rebuild the base.

On 5 November 2021, Antarctica New Zealand confirmed that PrimePort Timaru will host the redevelopment of the prefabricated Scott Base facilities. Besides the three interconnected buildings, the project also involves upgrading the Ross Island wind farm. The redevelopment project will create an estimated 700 jobs over the next six years.

===Historic site===
The A Hut of Scott Base is the only existing Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1956–1957) building in Antarctica. It has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 75), following a proposal by New Zealand to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

The base is made up of a collection of Chelsea Cucumber green&lt;ref name=&quot;artyclick/chelsea-cucumber&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; buildings which are linked by all-weather corridors. These buildings can accommodate 86 people over summer, with a &quot;skeleton staff&quot; of between 10 and 14 people remaining over the winter.

Like nearby McMurdo Station, Scott Base is connected to the global telephone network via a Satellite Earth Station operated by Spark New Zealand, located approximately away at Arrival Heights. Spark NZ also provide phone services to McMurdo for calls to New Zealand as well as to the Italian Programme at Terra Nova Bay. McMurdo Station has an independent communications infrastructure located at Black Island and linked to Ross Island via microwave.

Scott Base is today operated by Antarctica New Zealand. 

=== Wind turbines ===
Three Enercon E-33 wind turbines ( each) were installed in 2009 to co-power Scott Base and McMurdo Station, reducing diesel consumption by 11%: per year. Battery failures have reduced power capacity by 66%.

&quot;the small battery component that we have within our grid which we called the power store unfortunately has failed, and that was due to the failure of a non-replaceable part, so that has significantly limited our ability to use our wind turbines to the fullest capacity, so in 2019 we&#x27;ve had to curtail our Wind Farm to about 33% of its full potential&quot;Three new wind turbines were planned for the 2023-4 season, with great capacity: one new one will be greater then previous three combined. The strong winds make wind power a practical alternative, and the new wind system should supply 90% of the power at Scott Base.

==Climate==

A polar ice cap climate with evenly-distributed precipitation (Köppen &quot;EFf&quot;) prevails at Scott Base. The base has fairly typical weather conditions for coastal Antarctica, with minimum temperatures around and summer maximum only occasionally above freezing point. It is exposed to the full strength of southerly blizzards, although overall it is less windy than McMurdo Station. The maximum wind velocities experienced have been gusts up to with steady velocities under blizzard conditions of . The highest recorded temperature was , the coolest and the mean temperature .

<text>In the mathematical field of representation theory, a Lie algebra representation or representation of a Lie algebra is a way of writing a Lie algebra as a set of matrices (or endomorphisms of a vector space) in such a way that the Lie bracket is given by the commutator. In the language of physics, one looks for a vector space formula_1 together with a collection of operators on formula_1 satisfying some fixed set of commutation relations, such as the relations satisfied by the angular momentum operators.

The notion is closely related to that of a representation of a Lie group. Roughly speaking, the representations of Lie algebras are the differentiated form of representations of Lie groups, while the representations of the universal cover of a Lie group are the integrated form of the representations of its Lie algebra.

In the study of representations of a Lie algebra, a particular ring, called the universal enveloping algebra, associated with the Lie algebra plays an important role. The universality of this ring says that the category of representations of a Lie algebra is the same as the category of modules over its enveloping algebra.

==Formal definition==
Let formula_3 be a Lie algebra and let formula_1 be a vector space. We let formula_5 denote the space of endomorphisms of formula_1, that is, the space of all linear maps of formula_1 to itself. Here, the associative algebra formula_5 is turned into a Lie algebra with bracket given by the commutator: formula_9 for all &quot;s,t&quot; in formula_5. Then a representation of formula_3 on formula_1 is a Lie algebra homomorphism
:formula_13.
Explicitly, this means that formula_14 should be a linear map and it should satisfy
:formula_15
for all &quot;X, Y&quot; in formula_3. The vector space &quot;V&quot;, together with the representation &quot;ρ&quot;, is called a formula_3-module. (Many authors abuse terminology and refer to &quot;V&quot; itself as the representation).

The representation formula_14 is said to be faithful if it is injective.

One can equivalently define a formula_3-module as a vector space &quot;V&quot; together with a bilinear map formula_20 such that
:formula_21
for all &quot;X,Y&quot; in formula_3 and &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot;. This is related to the previous definition by setting &quot;X&quot; ⋅ &quot;v&quot; = &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)(&quot;v&quot;).

==Examples ==

===Adjoint representations===

The most basic example of a Lie algebra representation is the adjoint representation of a Lie algebra formula_23 on itself:
:formula_24
Indeed, by virtue of the Jacobi identity, formula_25 is a Lie algebra homomorphism.

===Infinitesimal Lie group representations===
A Lie algebra representation also arises in nature. If formula_26: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; is a homomorphism of (real or complex) Lie groups, and formula_3 and formula_28 are the Lie algebras of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; respectively, then the differential formula_29 on tangent spaces at the identities is a Lie algebra homomorphism. In particular, for a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;, a representation of Lie groups
:formula_30
determines a Lie algebra homomorphism
:formula_31
from formula_3 to the Lie algebra of the general linear group GL(&quot;V&quot;), i.e. the endomorphism algebra of &quot;V&quot;.

For example, let formula_33. Then the differential of formula_34 at the identity is an element of formula_35. Denoting it by formula_36 one obtains a representation formula_37 of &quot;G&quot; on the vector space formula_23. This is the adjoint representation of &quot;G&quot;. Applying the preceding, one gets the Lie algebra representation formula_39. It can be shown that formula_40, the adjoint representation of formula_3.

A partial converse to this statement says that every representation of a finite-dimensional (real or complex) Lie algebra lifts to a unique representation of the associated simply connected Lie group, so that representations of simply-connected Lie groups are in one-to-one correspondence with representations of their Lie algebras.

===In quantum physics===
In quantum theory, one considers &quot;observables&quot; that are self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. The commutation relations among these operators are then an important tool. The angular momentum operators, for example, satisfy the commutation relations
:formula_42.
Thus, the span of these three operators forms a Lie algebra, which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3) of the rotation group SO(3). Then if formula_1 is any subspace of the quantum Hilbert space that is invariant under the angular momentum operators, formula_1 will constitute a representation of the Lie algebra so(3). An understanding of the representation theory of so(3) is of great help in, for example, analyzing Hamiltonians with rotational symmetry, such as the hydrogen atom. Many other interesting Lie algebras (and their representations) arise in other parts of quantum physics. Indeed, the history of representation theory is characterized by rich interactions between mathematics and physics.

== Basic concepts ==
===Invariant subspaces and irreducibility===
Given a representation formula_45 of a Lie algebra formula_23, we say that a subspace formula_47 of formula_1 is invariant if formula_49 for all formula_50 and formula_51. A nonzero representation is said to be irreducible if the only invariant subspaces are formula_1 itself and the zero space formula_53. The term &quot;simple module&quot; is also used for an irreducible representation.

===Homomorphisms===
Let formula_23 be a Lie algebra. Let &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; be formula_23-modules. Then a linear map formula_56 is a homomorphism of formula_23-modules if it is formula_23-equivariant; i.e., formula_59 for any formula_60. If &quot;f&quot; is bijective, formula_61 are said to be equivalent. Such maps are also referred to as intertwining maps or morphisms.

Similarly, many other constructions from module theory in abstract algebra carry over to this setting: submodule, quotient, subquotient, direct sum, Jordan-Hölder series, etc.

===Schur&#x27;s lemma===

A simple but useful tool in studying irreducible representations is Schur&#x27;s lemma. It has two parts:
*If &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; are irreducible formula_23-modules and formula_56 is a homomorphism, then formula_64 is either zero or an isomorphism.
*If &quot;V&quot; is an irreducible formula_23-module over an algebraically closed field and formula_66 is a homomorphism, then formula_64 is a scalar multiple of the identity.

===Complete reducibility===

Let &quot;V&quot; be a representation of a Lie algebra formula_23. Then &quot;V&quot; is said to be completely reducible (or semisimple) if it is isomorphic to a direct sum of irreducible representations (cf. semisimple module). If &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional, then &quot;V&quot; is completely reducible if and only if every invariant subspace of &quot;V&quot; has an invariant complement. (That is, if &quot;W&quot; is an invariant subspace, then there is another invariant subspace &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;V&quot; is the direct sum of &quot;W&quot; and &quot;P&quot;.)

If formula_23 is a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero and &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional, then &quot;V&quot; is semisimple; this is Weyl&#x27;s complete reducibility theorem. Thus, for semisimple Lie algebras, a classification of irreducible (i.e. simple) representations leads immediately to classification of all representations. For other Lie algebra, which do not have this special property, classifying the irreducible representations may not help much in classifying general representations.

A Lie algebra is said to be reductive if the adjoint representation is semisimple. Certainly, every (finite-dimensional) semisimple Lie algebra formula_3 is reductive, since &quot;every&quot; representation of formula_3 is completely reducible, as we have just noted. In the other direction, the definition of a reductive Lie algebra means that it decomposes as a direct sum of ideals (i.e., invariant subspaces for the adjoint representation) that have no nontrivial sub-ideals. Some of these ideals will be one-dimensional and the rest are simple Lie algebras. Thus, a reductive Lie algebra is a direct sum of a commutative algebra and a semisimple algebra.

===Invariants===

An element &quot;v&quot; of &quot;V&quot; is said to be formula_23-invariant if formula_73 for all formula_74. The set of all invariant elements is denoted by formula_75.

==Basic constructions==
===Tensor products of representations===

If we have two representations of a Lie algebra formula_23, with &quot;V&quot;1 and &quot;V&quot;2 as their underlying vector spaces, then the tensor product of the representations would have &quot;V&quot;1 ⊗ &quot;V&quot;2 as the underlying vector space, with the action of formula_23 uniquely determined by the assumption that

:formula_78
for all formula_79 and formula_80.

In the language of homomorphisms, this means that we define formula_81 by the formula 
:formula_82. This is called the Kronecker sum of formula_83 and formula_84, defined in Matrix addition#Kronecker_sum and Kronecker product#Properties, and more specifically in Tensor product of representations. 

In the physics literature, the tensor product with the identity operator is often suppressed in the notation, with the formula written as
:formula_85,
where it is understood that formula_86 acts on the first factor in the tensor product and formula_87 acts on the second factor in the tensor product. In the context of representations of the Lie algebra su(2), the tensor product of representations goes under the name &quot;addition of angular momentum.&quot; In this context, formula_88 might, for example, be the orbital angular momentum while formula_89 is the spin angular momentum.

===Dual representations===

Let formula_23 be a Lie algebra and formula_91 be a representation of formula_23. Let formula_93 be the dual space, that is, the space of linear functionals on formula_1. Then we can define a representation formula_95 by the formula
:formula_96
where for any operator formula_97, the transpose operator formula_98 is defined as the &quot;composition with formula_99&quot; operator:
:formula_100
The minus sign in the definition of formula_101 is needed to ensure that formula_101 is actually a representation of formula_23, in light of the identity formula_104

If we work in a basis, then the transpose in the above definition can be interpreted as the ordinary matrix transpose.

===Representation on linear maps===

Let formula_61 be formula_23-modules, formula_23 a Lie algebra. Then formula_108 becomes a formula_23-module by setting formula_110. In particular, formula_111; that is to say, the formula_23-module homomorphisms from formula_1 to formula_47 are simply the elements of formula_108 that are invariant under the just-defined action of formula_23 on formula_108. If we take formula_47 to be the base field, we recover the action of formula_23 on formula_93 given in the previous subsection.

== Representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras ==
See Representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras.

== Enveloping algebras ==

To each Lie algebra formula_23 over a field &quot;k&quot;, one can associate a certain ring called the universal enveloping algebra of formula_23 and denoted formula_123. The universal property of the universal enveloping algebra guarantees that every representation of formula_23 gives rise to a representation of formula_123. Conversely, the PBW theorem tells us that formula_23 sits inside formula_123, so that every representation of formula_123 can be restricted to formula_23. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between representations of formula_23 and those of formula_123.

The universal enveloping algebra plays an important role in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras, described above. Specifically, the finite-dimensional irreducible representations are constructed as quotients of Verma modules, and Verma modules are constructed as quotients of the universal enveloping algebra.

The construction of formula_123 is as follows. Let &quot;T&quot; be the tensor algebra of the vector space formula_23. Thus, by definition, formula_134 and the multiplication on it is given by formula_135. Let formula_123 be the quotient ring of &quot;T&quot; by the ideal generated by elements of the form 
:formula_137. 
There is a natural linear map from formula_23 into formula_123 obtained by restricting the quotient map of formula_140 to degree one piece. The PBW theorem implies that the canonical map is actually injective. Thus, every Lie algebra formula_23 can be embedded into an associative algebra formula_142in such a way that the bracket on formula_23 is given by formula_144 in formula_99.

If formula_23 is abelian, then formula_123 is the symmetric algebra of the vector space formula_23.

Since formula_23 is a module over itself via adjoint representation, the enveloping algebra formula_123 becomes a formula_23-module by extending the adjoint representation. But one can also use the left and right regular representation to make the enveloping algebra a formula_23-module; namely, with the notation formula_153, the mapping formula_154 defines a representation of formula_23 on formula_123. The right regular representation is defined similarly.

== Induced representation ==
Let formula_23 be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero and formula_158 a subalgebra. formula_159 acts on formula_123 from the right and thus, for any formula_161-module &quot;W&quot;, one can form the left formula_123-module formula_163. It is a formula_23-module denoted by formula_165 and called the formula_23-module induced by &quot;W&quot;. It satisfies (and is in fact characterized by) the universal property: for any formula_23-module &quot;E&quot;
:formula_168.
Furthermore, formula_169 is an exact functor from the category of formula_161-modules to the category of formula_23-modules. These uses the fact that formula_123 is a free right module over formula_159. In particular, if formula_165 is simple (resp. absolutely simple), then &quot;W&quot; is simple (resp. absolutely simple). Here, a formula_23-module &quot;V&quot; is absolutely simple if formula_176 is simple for any field extension formula_177.

The induction is transitive: formula_178
for any Lie subalgebra formula_179 and any Lie subalgebra formula_180. The induction commutes with restriction: let formula_158 be subalgebra and formula_182 an ideal of formula_23 that is contained in formula_161. Set formula_185 and formula_186. Then formula_187.

==Infinite-dimensional representations and &quot;category O&quot;==
Let formula_23 be a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. (in the solvable or nilpotent case, one studies primitive ideals of the enveloping algebra; cf. Dixmier for the definitive account.)

The category of (possibly infinite-dimensional) modules over formula_23 turns out to be too large especially for homological algebra methods to be useful: it was realized that a smaller subcategory category O is a better place for the representation theory in the semisimple case in zero characteristic. For instance, the category O turned out to be of a right size to formulate the celebrated BGG reciprocity.

== (g,K)-module ==
One of the most important applications of Lie algebra representations is to the representation theory of real reductive Lie groups. The application is based on the idea that if formula_190 is a Hilbert-space representation of, say, a connected real semisimple linear Lie group &quot;G&quot;, then it has two natural actions: the complexification formula_23 and the connected maximal compact subgroup &quot;K&quot;. The formula_23-module structure of formula_190 allows algebraic especially homological methods to be applied and formula_194-module structure allows harmonic analysis to be carried out in a way similar to that on connected compact semisimple Lie groups.

==Representation on an algebra==
If we have a Lie superalgebra &quot;L&quot;, then a representation of &quot;L&quot; on an algebra is a (not necessarily associative) Z2 graded algebra &quot;A&quot; which is a representation of &quot;L&quot; as a Z2 graded vector space and in addition, the elements of &quot;L&quot; acts as derivations/antiderivations on &quot;A&quot;.

More specifically, if &quot;H&quot; is a pure element of &quot;L&quot; and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are pure elements of &quot;A&quot;,

:&quot;H&quot;[&quot;xy&quot;] = (&quot;H&quot;[&quot;x&quot;])&quot;y&quot; + (−1)&quot;xH&quot;&quot;x&quot;(&quot;H&quot;[&quot;y&quot;])

Also, if &quot;A&quot; is unital, then

:&quot;H&quot;[1] = 0

Now, for the case of a representation of a Lie algebra, we simply drop all the gradings and the (−1) to the some power factors.

A Lie (super)algebra is an algebra and it has an adjoint representation of itself. This is a representation on an algebra: the (anti)derivation property is the superJacobi identity.

If a vector space is both an associative algebra and a Lie algebra and the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra on itself is a representation on an algebra (i.e., acts by derivations on the associative algebra structure), then it is a Poisson algebra. The analogous observation for Lie superalgebras gives the notion of a Poisson superalgebra.

<text>The Northumbrian smallpipes (also known as the Northumbrian pipes) are bellows-blown bagpipes from Northeastern England, where they have been an important factor in the local musical culture for more than 250 years. The family of the Duke of Northumberland have had an official piper for over 250 years. The Northumbrian Pipers&#x27; Society was founded in 1928, to encourage the playing of the instrument and its music; Although there were so few players at times during the last century that some feared the tradition would die out, there are many players and makers of the instrument nowadays, and the Society has played a large role in this revival. In more recent times the Mayor of Gateshead and the Lord Mayor of Newcastle have both established a tradition of appointing official Northumbrian pipers.

In a survey of the bagpipes in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford University, the organologist Anthony Baines wrote: &quot;It is perhaps the most civilized of the bagpipes, making no attempt to go further than the traditional bagpipe music of melody over drone, but refining this music to the last degree.&quot;

The instrument consists of one chanter (generally with keys) and usually four drones.
The cylindrically bored chanter has a number of metal keys, most commonly seven, but chanters with a range of over two octaves can be made which require seventeen or more keys, all played with either the right hand thumb or left little finger. There is no overblowing employed to get this two octave range, so the keys are therefore necessary, together with the length of the chanter, for obtaining the two octaves.

The Northumbrian smallpipes&#x27; chanter having a completely closed end, combined with the unusually tight fingering style (each note is played by lifting only one finger or opening one key) means that traditional Northumbrian piping is staccato in style. Because the bores are so narrow, (typically about 4.3 millimetres for the chanter), the sound is far quieter than most other bagpipes.

A detailed account of the construction of Northumbrian smallpipes written by William Alfred Cocks and Jim F. Bryan
was published in 1967 by the Northumbrian Pipers&#x27; Society; it was very influential in promoting a revival of pipemaking from that time. This is now out of print, however. Another description, by Mike Nelson, is currently available. Nelson&#x27;s designs also include the &quot;School Pipes&quot;, G-sets with plastic components, made to be used in schools in Northumberland. These two accounts differ rather in their objectives, as Cocks and Bryan was based on descriptions of existing sets, notably by Robert Reid, Nelson being a description of his own design.

==Early development==
The earliest known description of such an instrument in Britain is in the Talbot manuscript from about 1695. The descriptions of bagpipes mentioned in this early source are reproduced in One of these instruments was a bellows-blown &#x27;Bagpipe, Scotch&#x27;, with three drones, whose keyless chanter had a one-octave range from G to g, with each note being sounded by uncovering a single hole, as in the modern instrument. This seems to have been a closed-ended chanter, for the lowest note is sounded by uncovering the lowest finger-hole – there was no bell-note, sounding with all holes covered; further, Talbot did not give the bore of the chanter, suggesting that it could not easily be measured. The three drones were in unison with the lowest note, G, of the chanter, the D a fourth below it, and G, an octave below. It has been argued that such instruments were derived from mouth-blown German three-drone bagpipes. These instruments seem to have been well-established in Northumberland by the early 18th century; many of the tunes in the William Dixon manuscript are suitable for such simple sets, and a painting of &quot;Joseph Turnbull, Piper to the Duchess of Northumberland&quot;, in Alnwick Castle, shows him with such a set. When Thomas Doubleday published an open letter in 1857, to the Duke of Northumberland about the &quot;ancient music of Northumberland&quot;, he wrote that &quot;The Northumbrian pipe is played upon by means of the method called &#x27;close fingering&#x27;, for which it is calculated. This method of stopping allows only of one finger being lifted at a time. Thus this instrument is limited to a single octave; and this (little as it is) admits of all the airs, to which it is really suited, being executed by its means; with the additional improvement that it may be played perfectly in tune, whilst the tones it produces being staccato and of a clear, ringing, pearly and brilliant character, gives the instrument a power which its appearance by no means promises, and which is really surprising when the diminutive size of its chanter or melody-pipe is considered&quot;. This is still a valid description of the unkeyed instrument, its repertoire, and proper playing style.

==Chanter==
Although keyless chanters seem to have been common for much of the 18th century, the earliest evidence of the introduction of a keyed chanter is the illustration and fingering chart in John Peacock&#x27;s tunebook, &quot;A Favorite Collection of Tunes with Variations Adapted for the Northumberland Small Pipes, Violin, or Flute&quot;, first published by William Wright, of Newcastle, in about 1800. 
The first of these were probably made by John Dunn. The instrument depicted in Peacock&#x27;s tunebook had only four keys, for F sharp, E and D below the octave G-g range of the unkeyed instrument, and another for the an above it. Two early pipe tunes written for such an instrument are &quot;Lamshaw&#x27;s Fancy&quot;, and &quot;Shields Fair&quot;. Lamshaw died in 1806, but is known to have played the &#x27;improved smallpipes&#x27;; although only one of these tunes bears his name, the other probably commemorates the Tynemouth and North Shields Fair, inaugurated in 1804. Lamshaw played there in his capacity as the Duke&#x27;s piper.

In subsequent years, the design was developed and refined further by Robert Reid and his son James; in particular, more keys were added.

In practice, beginning players find that the seven key chanter, with a range of D to b, is sufficient for playing most of the traditional piping repertoire. Such a chanter, made by Robert Reid, is shown below – the four views show respectively:

*from the front, the fingerholes (for G, A, B, c, d, e, f sharp),
*from the player&#x27;s left, the keys (for low E and high a) operated by the left little finger,
*from the back, the thumbhole (for high g) and two keys operated by the right thumb (for low F sharp and for d sharp),
*from the right, the other keys operated by the right thumb (for low D, c sharp, and high b).

Chanters with more keys permit the playing of tunes with a wider range or with more chromatic notes, and allow access to much of the fiddle repertoire.

The chanter has a double reed, similar in construction to an oboe reed. This leads to a distinctive sound, rich in higher harmonics.
As the bore is cylindrical, the odd harmonics are greatly predominant.

Traditionally, the chanter has been pitched somewhere between F and F sharp, older instruments often being close to modern F sharp. Several modern makers prefer to produce pipes pitched at what Northumbrian pipers refer to as F+, a pitch where the nominal G sounds approximately twenty cents sharp of F natural. This nominal G, however, is always notated as G. Nowadays, chanters are available anywhere from D to G, F+ being the commonest for solo or ensemble piping, but G being the most popular for playing ensemble with other instruments. Pipes with a tonic of F# are used for solo performance by several pipers now, being brighter in tone than those in F+, without being &#x27;squeaky&#x27;.

==Drones==

There are usually four drones on a set of Northumbrian pipes, mounted in parallel in a common stock. These are tunable, and three will usually be tuned to the tonic, dominant and octave tonic, the other one being shut off. Like the chanter, these have a narrow cylindrical bore. Unlike the chanter, though, the reeds have a single blade; they are either cut from a single tube of cane, or else a strip of cane in a metal body. Current pipe-makers have also experimented with plastic blades (Richard Evans) and carbon fibre blades (Mike Nelson) on metal bodies.

As well as a tuning slide for precise adjustment of tuning, each drone will usually possess one or two &#x27;bead holes&#x27; allowing its pitch to be raised by a tone or two, therefore allowing the piper to play in different musical keys, but still generally using the tonic, dominant and octave tonic combination of drone harmony.

Sets with five or even six drones have been made since the 19th century (to allow ease of retuning); however these are not common and generally specifically commissioned.

Only three drones are usually sounded at once, tuned for instance to G, D and g if the tonic of the tune is G. Sets sometimes have thumb-operated drone switches, allowing players to change key without stopping playing. Occasionally, though rarely, other tunings have been used, for example Tom Clough recommended G, c, g, suitable for tunes in C major, or D, A, d, a, for some tunes in D major.

==Repertoire==
The earliest bagpipe tunes from Northumberland, or indeed from anywhere in the British Isles, are found in William Dixon&#x27;s manuscript from the 1730s. Some of these can be played on Border pipes or an open-ended smallpipe like the modern Scottish smallpipes, but about half the tunes have a single octave range and sound well on the single-octave, simple, keyless Northumbrian pipe chanter. These tunes are almost all extended variation sets on dance tunes in various rhythms – reels, jigs, compound triple-time tunes (now known as slip jigs), and triple-time hornpipes.

At the beginning of the 19th century the first collection specifically for Northumbrian smallpipes was published, John Peacock&#x27;s &quot;Favorite Collection&quot;. Peacock was the last of the Newcastle Waits (musical watchmen), and probably the first smallpiper to play a keyed chanter. The collection contains a mixture of simple dance tunes, and extended variation sets. The variation sets, such as &quot;Cut and Dry Dolly&quot; are all for the single octave keyless chanter, but the dance tunes are often adaptations of fiddle tunes – many of these are Scottish, such as &quot;Money Musk&quot;. A pupil of Peacock, Robert Bewick, the son of Thomas Bewick the engraver, left five manuscript notebooks of pipetunes; these, dated between 1832 and 1843, are from the earliest decades in which keyed chanters were common, and they give a good early picture of the repertoire of a piper at this stage in the modern instrument&#x27;s development. Roughly contemporary with this is Lionel Winship&#x27;s manuscript, dated 1833, which has been made available in facsimile on ; it contains copies of the Peacock tunes, together with Scottish, Irish, and ballroom dance tunes. Both these sources include tunes in E minor, showing the d sharp key was available by this date.

The Northumbrian Minstrelsy, published in 1882, aimed to serve as a historical repository of Northeastern folk songs and pipe music, covering an area from Durham City to just north of the Scottish border. The book is divided into two sections: the first section presents the lyrics (accompanied by some music) of local, now-historical songs, while the second part provides the music for many Northumbrian smallpipe tunes, with very few lyrics. The Minstrelsey drew upon a number of antecedent sources, including Joseph Ritson&#x27;s Bishopric Garland and Northumberland Garland, John Bell&#x27;s Rhymes of Northern Bards, and Joseph Crawhall II&#x27;s Tunes for the Northumbrian Small Pipes.

As keyed chanters became more common, adaptations of fiddle music to be playable on smallpipes became more feasible, and common-time hornpipes such as those of the fiddler James Hill became a more significant part of the repertoire. &quot;The High Level&quot; is one. Many dance tunes in idioms similar to fiddle tunes have been composed by pipers specifically for their own instrument – &quot;The Barrington Hornpipe&quot;, by Thomas Todd, written in the late 19th century, is typical. Borrowing from other traditions and instruments has continued – in the early-to-mid 20th century, Billy Pigg, and Jack Armstrong (The Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s Piper) for instance, adapted many tunes from the Scottish and Irish pipe and fiddle repertoires to smallpipes, as well as composing tunes in various styles for the instrument.

Although many pipers now play predominantly dance tunes and some slow airs nowadays, extended variation sets have continued to form an important part of the repertoire. Tom Clough&#x27;s manuscripts contain many of these, some being variants of those in Peacock&#x27;s collection. Other variation sets were composed by Clough, such as those for &quot;Nae Guid Luck Aboot the Hoose&quot; which uses the extended range of a keyed chanter.

===Modern orchestral pieces for the smallpipes===
Primarily known as a virtuoso player of the English concertina, Alistair Anderson also plays Northumbrian smallpipes and has composed many tunes on and for the instrument. His compositions for groups of instruments have explored a greater range of harmonies than was traditionally associated with the smallpipes&#x27; repertoire, and he has collaborated with musicians such as jazz trombonist Annie Whitehead as well as writing the &quot;Shivering Stone&quot; suite which he performed with the Lindsay String Quartet.

Kathryn Tickell (a protégée of Anderson&#x27;s in her youth) has composed many virtuoso pieces for the smallpipes and has explored an even wider range of collaborations; besides The Chieftains and The Boys of the Lough, she has worked with the Penguin Café Orchestra, percussionist Evelyn Glennie, jazz saxophonist Andy Sheppard and Sting, as well as having had a modern classical piece, &quot;Kettletoft Inn&quot;, composed for her by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies.

In 2008 she composed a suite for the BBC Promenade Concerts for the London Sinfonietta, Muzsikas and Folkestra. More recently, Tickell has collaborated with pianist Joanna MacGregor and the Nash Ensemble, playing new compositions based on traditional Northumbrian tunes by Howard Skempton, Peter Maxwell Davies and Michael Finnissy.

==Playing style==
The traditional style of playing on the instrument is to play each note slightly staccato. Each note is only sounded by lifting one finger or operating one key. The aim is to play each note as full length as possible, but still separate from the next – &#x27;The notes should come out like peas&#x27;. The chanter is closed, and thus briefly silent, between any two notes, and there is an audible transient &#x27;pop&#x27; at the beginning and end of a note.

For decoration, it is common to play short grace notes preceding a melody note. Some pipers allow themselves to play these open-fingered rather than staccato, and Billy Pigg was able to get great expressive effects in this way – &#x27;You should be able to hear the bairns crying&#x27;. But &#x27;choyting&#x27; (the complex open-fingered gracing after the manner of Highland piping) is generally frowned on, and Tom Clough made a point of avoiding open-fingered ornament altogether, considering open-fingering &#x27;a grievous error&#x27;. Several pipers play in highly close-fingered styles, Chris Ormston and Adrian Schofield among them; even among those such as Kathryn Tickell who use open fingering for expression, the close-fingered technique is the basis of their playing.

<doc id="318715" wikidata="Q157873" url="?curid=318715" title="Third Battle of Kharkov">
<text>The Third Battle of Kharkov was a series of battles on the Eastern Front of World War II, undertaken by Nazi Germany&#x27;s Army Group South against the Soviet Red Army, around the city of Kharkov between 19 February and 15 March 1943. Known to the German side as the Donets Campaign, and in the Soviet Union as the Donbass and Kharkov operations, the German counterstrike led to the recapture of the cities of Kharkov and Belgorod.

As the German 6th Army was encircled in the Battle of Stalingrad, the Red Army undertook a series of wider attacks against the rest of Army Group South. These culminated on 2 January 1943 when the Red Army launched Operation Star and Operation Gallop, which between January and early February broke German defenses and led to the Soviet recapture of Kharkov, Belgorod, Kursk, as well as Voroshilovgrad and Izium. These victories caused participating Soviet units to over-extend themselves. Freed on 2 February by the surrender of the German 6th Army, the Red Army&#x27;s Central Front turned its attention west and on 25 February expanded its offensive against both Army Group South and Army Group Center. Months of continuous operations had taken a heavy toll on the Soviet forces and some divisions were reduced to 1,000–2,000 combat-effective soldiers. On 19 February, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein launched his Kharkov counterstrike, using the fresh II SS Panzer Corps and two panzer armies. Manstein benefited greatly from the massive air support of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen&#x27;s Luftflotte 4, whose 1,214 aircraft flew over 1,000 sorties per day from 20 February to 15 March to support the German ground troops, a level of airpower equal to that during the Case Blue strategic offensive a year earlier.

The Wehrmacht flanked, encircled, and defeated the Red Army&#x27;s armored spearheads south of Kharkov. This enabled Manstein to renew his offensive against the city of Kharkov proper on 7 March. Despite orders to encircle Kharkov from the north, the SS Panzer Corps instead decided to directly engage Kharkov on 11 March. This led to four days of house-to-house fighting before Kharkov was recaptured by the SS Division Leibstandarte on 15 March. The German forces recaptured Belgorod two days later, creating the salient which in July 1943 would lead to the Battle of Kursk. The German offensive cost the Red Army an estimated 90,000 casualties. The house-to-house fighting in Kharkov was also particularly bloody for the German SS Panzer Corps, which had suffered approximately 4,300 men killed and wounded by the time operations ended in mid-March.

==Background==
At the start of 1943, the German Wehrmacht faced a crisis as Soviet forces encircled and reduced the German 6th Army in the Battle of Stalingrad and expanded their Winter Campaign towards the Don River. On 2 February 1943 the 6th Army&#x27;s commanding officers surrendered, and an estimated 90,000 men were taken prisoner by the Red Army. Total German losses at the Battle of Stalingrad, excluding prisoners, were between 120,000 and 150,000. Throughout 1942 German casualties totaled around 1.9 million personnel, and by the start of 1943 the Wehrmacht was around 470,000 men below full strength on the Eastern Front. At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht was equipped with around 3,300 tanks; by 23 January only 495 tanks, mostly of older types, remained operational along the entire length of the Soviet–German front. As the forces of the Don Front were destroying the German forces in Stalingrad, the Red Army&#x27;s command (&quot;Stavka&quot;) ordered the Soviet forces to conduct a new offensive, which encompassed the entire southern wing of the Soviet–German front from Voronezh to Rostov.
On 2 February, the Red Army launched Operation Star, threatening the cities of Belgorod, Kharkov and Kursk. A Soviet drive, spearheaded by four tank corps organized under Lieutenant-General Markian Popov, pierced the German front by crossing the Donets River and pressing into the German rear. On 15 February, two fresh Soviet tank corps threatened the city of Zaporizhia on the Dnieper River, which controlled the last major road to Rostov and housed the headquarters of Army Group South and &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; (Air Fleet Four). Despite Adolf Hitler&#x27;s orders to hold the city, Kharkov was abandoned by German forces and the city was recaptured by the Red Army on 16 February.
Hitler immediately flew to Manstein&#x27;s headquarters at Zaporizhia. Manstein informed him that an immediate counterattack on Kharkov would be fruitless, but that he could successfully attack the overextended Soviet flank with his five Panzer corps, and recapture the city later.
On 19 February Soviet armored units broke through the German lines and approached the city. In view of the worsening situation, Hitler gave Manstein operational freedom. When Hitler departed, the Soviet forces were only some away from the airfield.
In conjunction with Operation Star the Red Army also launched Operation Gallop south of Star, pushing the Wehrmacht away from the Donets, taking Voroshilovgrad and Izium, worsening the German situation further. By this time Stavka believed it could decide the war in the southwest Russian SFSR and eastern Ukrainian SSR, expecting total victory.

The surrender of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad freed six Soviet armies, under the command of Konstantin Rokossovsky, which were refitted and reinforced by the 2nd Tank Army and the 70th Army. These forces were repositioned in the junction between German Army Groups Center and South. Known to the Soviet forces as the Kharkov and Donbass operations, the offensive sought to surround and destroy German forces in the Orel salient, cross the Desna River and surround and destroy German Army Group Center. Originally planned to begin between 12 and 15 February, deployment problems forced Stavka to push the start date back to 25 February. Meanwhile, the Soviet 60th Army pushed the German Second Army&#x27;s 4th Panzer Division away from Kursk, while the Soviet 13th Army forced the Second Panzer Army to turn on its flank. This opened a breach between these two German forces, shortly to be exploited by Rokossovsky&#x27;s offensive. While the Soviet 14th and 48th Armies attacked the Second Panzer Army&#x27;s right flank, making minor gains, Rokossovsky launched his offensive on 25 February, breaking through German lines and threatening to surround and cut off the German Second Panzer Army and the Second Army, to the south. Unexpected German resistance began to slow the operation considerably, offering Rokossovsky only limited gains on the left flank of his attack and in the center. Elsewhere, the Soviet 2nd Tank Army had successfully penetrated of the German rear, along the left flank of the Soviet offensive, increasing the length of the army&#x27;s flank by an estimated .

While the Soviet offensive continued, Field Marshal von Manstein was able to put the SS Panzer Corps – now reinforced by the 3rd SS Panzer Division – under the command of the 4th Panzer Army, while Hitler agreed to release seven understrength panzer and motorized divisions for the impending counteroffensive. The 4th Air Fleet, under the command of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen, was able to regroup and increase the number of daily sorties from an average of 350 in January to 1,000 in February, providing German forces strategic air superiority. On 20 February, the Red Army was perilously close to Zaporizhia, signaling the beginning of the German counterattack, known to the German forces as the Donets Campaign.

==Comparison of forces==
Between 13 January and 3 April 1943, an estimated 210,000 Red Army soldiers took part in what was known as the Voronezh–Kharkov Offensive. In all, an estimated 6,100,000 Soviet soldiers were committed to the entire Eastern Front, with another 659,000 out of action with wounds. In comparison, the Germans could account for 2,988,000 personnel on the Eastern Front. As a result, the Red Army deployed around twice as many personnel as the Wehrmacht in early February. As a result of Soviet over-extension and the casualties they had taken during their offensive, at the beginning of Manstein&#x27;s counterattack the Germans could achieve a tactical superiority in numbers, including the number of tanks present – for example, Manstein&#x27;s 350 tanks outnumbered Soviet armor almost seven to one at the point of contact, and were far better supplied with fuel.

===German forces===
At the time of the counterattack, Manstein could count on the 4th Panzer Army, composed of XLVIII Panzer Corps, the SS Panzer Corps and the First Panzer Army, with the XL and LVII Panzer Corps. The XLVIII Panzer Corps was composed of the 6th, 11th and 17th Panzer Divisions, while the SS Panzer Corps was organized with the 1st SS, 2nd SS and 3rd SS Panzer Division. In early February, the combined strength of the SS Panzer Corps was an estimated 20,000 soldiers. The 4th Panzer Army and the First Panzer Army were situated south of the Red Army&#x27;s bulge into German lines, with the First Panzer Army to the east of the 4th Panzer Army. The SS Panzer Corps was deployed along the northern edge of the bulge, on the northern front of Army Group South.

The Germans were able to amass around 160,000 men against the 210,000 Red Army soldiers. The German Wehrmacht was understrength, especially after continuous operations between June 1942 and February 1943, to the point where Hitler appointed a committee made up of Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Martin Bormann and Hans Lammers, to recruit 800,000 new able-bodied men – half of whom would come from &quot;nonessential industries&quot;. The effects of this recruitment were not seen until around May 1943, when the German armed forces were at their highest strength since the beginning of the war, with 9.5 million personnel.

By the start of 1943 Germany&#x27;s armored forces had sustained heavy casualties. It was unusual for a Panzer division to field more than 100 tanks, and most averaged only 70–80 serviceable tanks at any given time. After the fighting around Kharkov, Heinz Guderian embarked on a program to bring Germany&#x27;s mechanized forces up to strength. Despite his efforts, a German panzer division could only count on an estimated 10,000–11,000 personnel, out of an authorized strength of 13,000–17,000. Only by June did a panzer division begin to field between 100 and 130 tanks each. SS divisions were normally better equipped, with an estimated 150 tanks, a battalion of self-propelled assault guns and enough half-tracks to motorize most of its infantry and reconnaissance soldiers – and these had an authorized strength of an estimated 19,000 personnel. At this time, the bulk of Germany&#x27;s armor was still composed of Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, although the SS Division Das Reich had been outfitted with a number of Tiger I tanks.

The 4th Panzer Army was commanded by General Hermann Hoth, while the First Panzer Army fell under the leadership of General Eberhard von Mackensen. The 6th, 11th and 17th Panzer Divisions were commanded by Generals Walther von Hünersdorff, Hermann Balck and Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin, respectively. The SS Panzer Corps was commanded by General Paul Hausser, who also had SS Division Totenkopf under his command.

===Red Army===
Since the beginning of the Red Army&#x27;s exploitation of Germany&#x27;s Army Group South&#x27;s defenses in late January and early February, the fronts involved included the Bryansk, Voronezh and Southwestern Fronts. These were under the command of Generals M. A. Reiter, Filipp Golikov and Nikolai Vatutin, respectively. On 25 February, Marshal Rokossovsky&#x27;s Central Front also joined the battle. These were positioned in such a way that Reiter&#x27;s Briansk Front was on the northern flank of Army Group South, while Voronezh was directly opposite of Kursk, and the Southwestern Front was located opposite their opponents. Central Front was deployed between the Briansk and Voronezh Fronts, to exploit the success of both of these Soviet units, which had created a gap in the defenses of the German Second Panzer Army. This involved an estimated 500,000 soldiers, while around 346,000 personnel were involved in the defense of Kharkov after the beginning of the German counterstroke.

Like their German counterparts, Soviet divisions were also seriously understrength. For example, divisions in the 40th Army averaged 3,500–4,000 men each, while the 69th Army fielded some divisions which could only count on 1,000–1,500 soldiers. Some divisions had as little as 20–50 mortars to provide fire support. This shortage in manpower and equipment led Vatutin&#x27;s Southwestern Front to request over 19,000 soldiers and 300 tanks, while it was noted that the Voronezh Front had only received 1,600 replacements since the beginning of operations in 1943. By the time Manstein launched his counteroffensive, the Voronezh Front had lost so much manpower and had overextended itself to the point where it could no longer offer assistance to the Southwestern Front, south of it. The 1st Czechoslovak Independent Field Battalion, commanded by Ludvík Svoboda, was also attached to the Soviet forces and subsequently participated in fighting alongside Soviet forces at Sokolov.

==Manstein&#x27;s counterattack==
What was known to the Germans as the Donets Campaign took place between 19 February and 15 March 1943. Originally, Manstein foresaw a three-stage offensive. The first stage encompassed the destruction of the Soviet spearheads, which had over-extended themselves through their offensive. The second stage included the recapture of Kharkov, while the third stage was designed to attack the Soviet forces at Kursk, in conjunction with Army Group Center – this final stage was ultimately called off due to the advent of the Soviet spring thaw (&quot;Rasputitsa&quot;) and Army Group Center&#x27;s reluctance to participate.

===First stage: 19 February – 6 March===
On 19 February, Hausser&#x27;s SS Panzer Corps was ordered to strike southwards, to provide a screen for the 4th Panzer Army&#x27;s attack. Simultaneously, Army Detachment Hollidt was ordered to contain the continuing Soviet efforts to break through German lines. The 1st Panzer Army was ordered to drive north in an attempt to cut off and destroy Popov&#x27;s Mobile Group, using accurate intelligence on Soviet strength which allowed the Wehrmacht to pick and choose their engagements and bring about tactical numerical superiority. The 1st and 4th Panzer Armies were also ordered to attack the overextended Soviet 6th Army and 1st Guards Army. Between 20 and 23 February, the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) cut through the 6th Army&#x27;s flank, eliminating the Soviet threat to the Dnieper River and successfully surrounding and destroying a number of Red Army units south of the Samara River. The SS Division Das Reich advanced in a northeastern direction, while the SS Division Totenkopf was put into action on 22 February, advancing parallel to Das Reich. These two divisions successfully cut the supply lines to the Soviet spearheads. First Panzer Army was able to surround and pocket Popov&#x27;s Mobile Group by 24 February, although a sizable contingent of Soviet troops managed to escape north. On 22 February, alarmed by the success of the German counterattack, the Soviet &quot;Stavka&quot; ordered the Voronezh Front to shift the 3rd Tank Army and 69th Army south, in an effort to alleviate pressure on the Southwestern Front and destroy German forces in the Krasnograd area.
The Red Army&#x27;s 3rd Tank Army began to engage German units south of Kharkov, performing a holding action while Manstein&#x27;s offensive continued. By 24 February, the Wehrmacht had pulled the Großdeutschland Division off the line, leaving the 167th and 320th infantry divisions, a regiment from the Totenkopf division and elements from the Leibstandarte division to defend the Western edge of the bulge created by the Soviet offensive. Between 24 and 27 February, the 3rd Tank Army and 69th Army continued to attack this portion of the German line, but without much success. With supporting Soviet units stretched thin, the attack began to falter. On 25 February, Rokossovky&#x27;s Central Front launched their offensive between the German Second and 2nd Panzer Armies, with encouraging results along the German flanks, but struggling to keep the same pace in the center of the attack. As the offensive progressed, the attack on the German right flank also began to stagnate in the face of increased resistance, while the attack on the left began to over-extend itself.

In the face of German success against the Southwestern Front, including attempts by the Soviet 6th Army breaking out of the encirclement, &quot;Stavka&quot; ordered the Voronezh Front to relinquish control of the 3rd Tank Army to the Southwestern Front. To ease the transition, the 3rd Tank Army gave two rifle divisions to the 69th Army, and attacked south in a bid to destroy the SS Panzer Corps. Low on fuel and ammunition after the march south, the 3rd Tank Army&#x27;s offensive was postponed until 3 March. The 3rd Tank Army was harassed and severely damaged by continuous German aerial attacks with Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers. Launching its offensive on 3 March, the 3rd Tank Army&#x27;s 15th Tank Corps struck into advancing units of the 3rd SS Panzer Division and immediately went on the defensive. Ultimately, the 3rd SS was able to pierce the 15th Tank Corps&#x27; lines and link up with other units of the same division advancing north, successfully encircling the Soviet tank corps. The 3rd Tank Army&#x27;s 12th Tank Corps was also forced on the defensive immediately, after SS divisions Leibstandarte and Das Reich threatened to cut off the 3rd Tank Army&#x27;s supply route. By 5 March, the attacking 3rd Tank Army had been badly mauled, with only a small number of men able to escape northwards, and was forced to erect a new defensive line.

The destruction of Popov&#x27;s Mobile Group and the Soviet 6th Army during the early stages of the German counterattack created a large gap between Soviet lines. Taking advantage of uncoordinated and piecemeal Soviet attempts to plug this gap, Manstein ordered a continuation of the offensive towards Kharkov. Between 1–5 Panzer Army, including the SS Panzer Corps, covered and positioned itself only about south of Kharkov. By 6 March, the SS Division Leibstandarte made a bridgehead over the Mosh River, opening the road to Kharkov. The success of Manstein&#x27;s counterattack forced Stavka to stop Rokossovsky&#x27;s offensive.

Richthofen&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; played a decisive role in the success of the German counteroffensive. While simultaneously carrying out airlift operations in the Kuban bridgehead, it increased its daily sortie average from 350 in January to 1,000 in February, providing the army with excellent close air support and air interdiction. It relentlessly attacked Soviet troop columns, tanks, fortified positions, as well as supply depots and columns. On 22 February, Richthofen noted with satisfaction that the number of sorties flown that day was 1,500. On 23 February the number was 1,200. Richthofen personally directed the major air attacks in consultation with the army generals and his subordinate air corps commanders. In order to avoid dissipating his strength, he concentrated all available forces in a single &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot;, including the concentration of multiple air commands on the same target at the same time. A British government analysis in 1948 praised Richthofen&#x27;s skill during the Third Battle of Kharkov, singling out his constant use of the principles of &quot;extreme flexibility, coordination and concentration&quot;.

===Advance towards Kharkov: 7–10 March===
While Rokossovsky&#x27;s Central Front continued its offensive against the German Second Army, which had by now been substantially reinforced with fresh divisions, the renewed German offensive towards Kharkov took it by surprise. On 7 March, Manstein made the decision to press on towards Kharkov, despite the coming of the spring thaw. Instead of attacking east of Kharkov, Manstein decided to orient the attack towards the west of Kharkov and then encircle it from the north. The &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; Panzergrenadier Division had also returned to the front, and threw its weight into the attack, threatening to split the 69th Army and the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army. Between 8–9 March, the SS Panzer Corps completed its drive north, splitting the 69th and 40th Soviet Armies, and on 9 March it turned east to complete its encirclement. Despite attempts by the &quot;Stavka&quot; to curtail the German advance by throwing in the freshly released 19th Rifle Division and 186th Tank Brigade, the German drive continued.

On 9 March, the Soviet 40th Army counterattacked against the &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; Division in a final attempt to restore communications with the 3rd Tank Army. This counterattack was caught by the expansion of the German offensive towards Kharkov on 10 March. That same day, the 4th Panzer Army issued orders to the SS Panzer Corps to take Kharkov as soon as possible, prompting Hausser to order an immediate attack on the city by the three SS Panzer divisions. &quot;Das Reich&quot; would come from the West, LSSAH would attack from north, and &quot;Totenkopf&quot; would provide a protective screen along the north and northwestern flanks. Despite attempts by General Hoth to order Hausser to stick to the original plan, the SS Panzer Corps commander decided to continue with his own plan of attack on the city, although Soviet defenses forced him to postpone the attack until the next day. Manstein issued an order to continue outflanking the city, although leaving room for a potential attack on Kharkov if there was little Soviet resistance, but Hausser decided to disregard the order and continue with his own assault.

===Fight for the city: 11–15 March===
Early morning 11 March, the LSSAH launched a two-prong attack into northern Kharkov. The 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment, advancing from the Northwest, split up into two columns advancing towards northern Kharkov on either side of the Belgorod-Kharkov railroad. The 2nd Battalion, on the right side of the railroad, attacked the city&#x27;s Severnyi Post district, meeting heavy resistance and advancing only to the Severnyi railway yard by the end of the day. On the opposite side of the railroad, the 1st Battalion struck at the district of Alexeyevka, meeting a T-34-led Soviet counterattack which drove part of the 1st Battalion back out of the city. Only with aerial and artillery support provided by Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers and StuG assault guns were the German infantry able to battle their way into the city. A flanking attack from the rear finally allowed the German forces to achieve a foothold in that area of the city. Simultaneously, the 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, with armor attached from a separate unit, attacked down the main road from Belgorod, fighting an immediate counterattack produced over the Kharkov&#x27;s airport, coming on their left flank. Fighting their way past Soviet T-34s, this German contingent was able to lodge itself into Kharkov&#x27;s northern suburbs. From the northeast, another contingent of German infantry, armor and self-propelled guns attempted to take control of the road exits to the cities of Rogan and Chuhuiv. This attack penetrated deeper into Kharkov, but low on fuel the armor was forced to entrench itself and turn to the defensive.
&quot;Das Reich&quot; division attacked on the same day, along the west side of Kharkov. After penetrating into the city&#x27;s Zalyutino district, the advance was stopped by a deep anti-tank ditch, lined with Soviet defenders, including anti-tank guns. A Soviet counterattack was repulsed after a bloody firefight. A detachment of the division fought its way to the southern approaches of the city, cutting off the road to Merefa. At around 15:00, Hoth ordered Hausser to immediately disengage with &quot;SS Das Reich&quot;, and instead redeploy to cut off escaping Soviet troops. Instead, Hausser sent a detachment from SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; division for this task and informed Hoth that the risk of disengaging with &quot;SS Das Reich&quot; was far too great. On the night of 11–12 March, a breakthrough element crossed the anti-tank ditch, taking the Soviet defenders by surprise, and opening a path for tanks to cross. This allowed &quot;Das Reich&quot; to advance to the city&#x27;s main railway station, which would be the farthest this division would advance into the city. Hoth repeated his order at 00:15, on 12 March, and Hausser replied as he had replied on 11 March. A third attempt by Hoth was obeyed, and &quot;Das Reich&quot; disengaged, using a corridor opened by LSSAH to cross northern Kharkov and redeploy east of the city.

On 12 March, the LSSAH made progress into the city&#x27;s center, breaking through the staunch Soviet defenses in the northern suburbs and began a house to house fight towards the center. By the end of the day, the division had reached a position just two blocks north of Dzerzhinsky Square. The 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion was able to surround the square, after taking heavy casualties from Soviet snipers and other defenders, by evening. When taken, the square was renamed &quot;Platz der Leibstandarte&quot;. That night, 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, under the command of Joachim Peiper linked up with the 2nd Battalion in Dzerzhinsky Square and attacked southwards, crossing the Kharkiv River and creating a bridgehead, opening the road to Moscow Avenue. Meanwhile, the division&#x27;s left wing reached the junction of the Volchansk and Chuhuiv exit roads and went on the defensive, fighting off a number of Soviet counterattacks.

The next day, the LSSAH struck southwards towards the Kharkov River from Peiper&#x27;s bridgehead, clearing Soviet resistance block by block. In a bid to trap the city&#x27;s defenders in the center, the 1st Battalion of the 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment re-entered the city using the Volchansk exit road. At the same time, Peiper&#x27;s forces were able to breakout south, suffering from bitter fighting against a tenacious Soviet defense, and link up with the division&#x27;s left wing at the Volchansk and Chuhuiv road junction. Although the majority of &quot;Das Reich&quot; had, by now, disengaged from the city, a single Panzergrenadier Regiment remained to clear the southwestern corner of the city, eliminating resistance by the end of the day. This effectively put two-thirds of the city under German control.

Fighting in the city began to wind down on 14 March. The day was spent with the LSSAH clearing the remnants of Soviet resistance, pushing east along a broad front. By the end of the day, the entire city was declared to be back in German hands. Despite the declaration that the city had fallen, fighting continued over the next two days, as German units cleared the remnants of resistance in the tractor works factory complex, in the southern outskirts of the city.

==Aftermath==
Army Group South&#x27;s Donets Campaign had cost the Red Army over 80,000 personnel casualties. Of these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 were killed or went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces in the area and prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties are more difficult to come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.

As the SS Panzer Corps began to emerge from the city, they engaged Soviet units positioned directly southwest of the city, including the 17th NKVD Brigade, 19th Rifle Division and 25th Guards Rifle Division. Attempts by the Red Army to re-establish communication with the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army continued, although in vain. On 14–15 March, these forces were given permission to withdraw to the northern Donets River. The Soviet 40th and 69th armies had been engaged since 13 March with the &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; Panzergrenadier Division, and had been split by the German drive. After the fall of Kharkov, the Soviet defense of the Donets had collapsed, allowing Manstein&#x27;s forces to drive to Belgorod on 17 March, and take it by the next day. Muddy weather and exhaustion forced Manstein&#x27;s counterstroke to end soon thereafter.

The military historian Bevin Alexander wrote that the Third Battle of Kharkov was &quot;the last great victory of German arms in the eastern front&quot;, while the military historian Robert Citino referred to the operation as &quot;not a victory at all&quot;. Borrowing from a chapter title of the book &quot;Manstein&quot; by Mungo Melvin, Citino described the battle as a &quot;brief glimpse of victory&quot;. According to Citino, the Donets Campaign was a successful counteroffensive against an overextended and overconfident enemy and did not amount to a strategic victory.

Following the German success at Kharkov, Hitler was presented with two options. The first, known as the &quot;backhand method&quot; was to wait for the inevitable renewal of the Soviet offensive and conduct another operation similar to that of Kharkov – allowing the Red Army to take ground, extend itself and then counterattack and surround it. The second, or the &quot;forehand method&quot;, encompassed a major German offensive by Army Groups South and Center against the protruding Kursk salient. Because of Hitler&#x27;s obsession with preserving the front, he chose the &quot;forehand method&quot;, which led to the Battle of Kursk.

<text>Berenice IV Epiphaneia (; 77–55 BC, born and died in Alexandria, Egypt) was ruling Ptolemaic queen and Hellenistic pharaoh of the Ptolemaic kingdom. From 58 to 55 BC, Berenice IV ruled Egypt during the political exile of her father Ptolemy XII Auletes to Rome. It is unclear if she was co-ruler of Egypt with her mother Cleopatra V or a possible sister Cleopatra VI from 58 to 57 BC, but became sole ruler in 57 BC. On the return of Ptolemy XII to Egypt with Roman military aid and an army led by Aulus Gabinius, Berenice IV was overthrown and executed by her rival father, who later bequeathed his throne to his daughter Cleopatra VII and son Ptolemy XIII as co-rulers.

==Biography==

Berenice was the daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes and Cleopatra V Tryphaena, and sister to three pharaohs - Cleopatra VII, Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV - as well to princess and claimant to the Egyptian throne, Arsinoe IV.

In 59 BC Julius Caesar was one of the consuls of Rome. It was believed that the annexation of Egypt was part of his own political programme, the excuse being that the king of Egypt, Ptolemy XII Auletes, was illegitimate and had no right to rule. Ptolemy Auletes responded by buying Caesar&#x27;s support at huge expense, and the Romans passed a law to recognise Ptolemy Auletes as legitimate king of Egypt. The treaty however said nothing about Cyprus, where another Ptolemy, the brother of Ptolemy Auletes, was king.

In 58 BC the Romans annexed Cyprus, forcing the deposed king and brother of Auletes into suicide. The loss of Cyprus, and the poor state of the Egyptian economy following the bribes to Caesar, triggered civil unrest in Ptolemy Auletes&#x27; capital Alexandria. Unable to quash the unrest on his own, Ptolemy Auletes went in 58 BC to Rome to ask for military support, leaving his family behind in Egypt. In his absence, the Alexandrines declared him deposed, and in his place nominated his daughter Berenice IV Epiphaneia and (according to the ancient historian Porphyry) &quot;[Auletes&#x27;] eldest daughter&quot; Cleopatra VI Tryphaena as joint monarchs. Some, though not all, modern historians believe Porphyry made an error here, and that Cleopatra VI Tryphaena was in fact Ptolemy XII Auletes&#x27; wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena.

Unable to muster up immediate support from the Romans, Ptolemy Auletes was initially unable to take his kingdom back from the two queens. From 58 till the end of 57 he resided in Rome or at Pompey&#x27;s villa in the Alban hills, busily working upon the senators by bribes or promises, and procuring the assassination of envoys sent from Alexandria to Rome; he then left Rome and went to Ephesus, and lived in the sacred precinct of Artemis. In the meantime Cleopatra Tryphaena is believed to have died in 57 B.C. of unknown causes, leaving the young Berenice sole queen in Alexandria.

As a lone woman ruling Egypt, she was expected to marry and have a man as a co-regent. Her advisors first tried to arrange a marriage with two Seleucid princes, both descended from Ptolemy VIII. The first was a son of Cleopatra Selene of Syria: he died whilst negotiations were in progress. The second was a grandson of Tryphaena and Antiochus VIII Grypus called Philip (possibly Philip II Philoromaeus): he was forbidden by the Roman governor of Syria Aulus Gabinius to accept the invitation. The Alexandrines then, thirdly, arranged a marriage with a man called Seleucus, connected to the Seleucid royal house. He may have been another son of Cleopatra Selene of Syria, perhaps Seleucus VII Philometor; alternatively he may have been an illegitimate son of one of the Seleucid kings. When he arrived in Alexandria, the Alexandrines were shocked by his vulgar appearance and manners, and nicknamed him Kybiosaktes, &quot;Salt-fish-monger&quot;. Berenice, after a few days of marriage, found she was unable to bear his coarseness and vulgarity, and felt that he could not command the respect of the populace: she had him strangled. The court then arranged a marriage with a Greek called Archelaus. Archelaus had been appointed prince-pontiff at the temple of the Great Mother at Comana in Pontus by Pompey, and claimed to be a son of King Mithridates VI of Pontus (and, if so, to be distantly related in blood to the Ptolemies). Strabo instead says his father was Archelaus, one of the chief marshals of Mithridates VI in the First Mithridatic War who defected to the Romans. At that time Archelaus was an associate of Aulus Gabinius, and had hoped to join with him on an expedition against the Parthians. Gabinius furthermore had become suspicious of Archelaus&#x27;s associations with the Egyptians, and had him arrested. Persuaded though that Archelaus was no threat, and perhaps bribed, Gabinius voluntarily released him. In the winter 56‑55 Archelaus came to Egypt, married Berenice, and was given a title of king, although he is not known to be mentioned in documents as his wife&#x27;s formal co-ruler, and it&#x27;s presumed she never allowed him to become one.

In the spring of 55 Ptolemy Auletes and a Roman force invaded Egypt. Berenice and Archelaus were defeated, and Archelaus died in battle. Ptolemy Auletes was installed once more as king in Alexandria by the Romans. One of Ptolemy Auletes&#x27; first acts after his restoration was to execute his daughter Berenice, for the crime of usurping his throne. 
 He would later bequeath his throne to two siblings of Berenice IV: Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy XIII.

<doc id="318718" wikidata="Q3328743" url="?curid=318718" title="Music of the Philippines">
<text>The music of the Philippines () includes the musical performance arts in the Philippines and the music of Filipinos composed in various local and international genres and styles. Philippine musical compositions are often a mixture of Indigenous styles, and various Asian styles, as well as Spanish/Latin American and (US) American influences through foreign rule from those countries.

== Indigenous music ==
Notable indigenous musicians include Ukà of Lange-Lange who specialized in the kutiyapi, the most difficult of all indigenous Philippine instruments, Masino Intaray who specialized in the basal, aroding, and babarak, and Samaon Solaiman, who specializes as well in the kutiyapi. Notable folk song composers include the National Artist for Music Lucio San Pedro, who composed the famous &quot;Sa Ugoy ng Duyan&quot; that recalls the loving touch of a mother to her child. Another composer, the National Artist for Music Antonino Buenaventura, is notable for notating folk songs and dances. Buenaventura composed the music for &quot;Pandanggo sa Ilaw&quot;.

===Gong music===

Philippine gong music today can be geographically divided into two types: the flat gongs commonly known as &quot;gangsà&quot; unique to the groups in the Cordillera mountains and the bossed gongs of Muslim and animist groups spanning the Sulu archipelago, much of Mindanao, Palawan, and the inlands of Panay and Mindoro. The latter were once ubiquitous throughout coastal, lowland Philippine societies before widespread Christianization, and less frequently imports of flat &quot;chau&quot; gongs from China.

&quot;Kulintang&quot; refers to a racked gong chime instrument played in the southern islands of the Philippines, along with its varied accompanying ensembles. Different groups have different ways of playing the &quot;kulintang&quot;. Two major groups seem to stand out in &quot;kulintang&quot; music. These are the Maguindanaon and the Maranao. The kulintang instrument itself could be traced to either the introduction of gongs to Southeast Asia from China before the 9th century CE or more likely, to the introduction of bossed gong chimes from Java in the 16th century. Nevertheless, the kulintang ensemble is the most advanced form of ensemble music with origins in the pre-colonial epoch of Philippine history and is a living tradition in southern parts of the country.

The musical traditions involving the &quot;kulintang&quot; ensemble consist of regional musical styles and varying instrumentation transcending the present national borders of maritime Southeast Asia, comprising Buddhist, animist, Muslim, and Christian peoples around Borneo, lesser Sunda islands, Sulawesi, Maluku, Sulu, and Mindanao. It is distantly related to the &quot;gamelan&quot; ensembles of Java, Bali, Sumatra &amp; the Malay peninsula, and south Borneo, even moreso the ensembles of mainland Southeast Asia, primarily because of the usage for the same racked bossed gong chimes that play melody and/or percussion

== Hispanic-influenced music ==

Philippine folk music has some Spanish and Latin American influence, derived from the period the country, along with Guam and the Mariana islands, was ruled from Mexico City and Madrid by the Spanish viceroyalty. It is seen in folk and traditional music, of coastal lowland regions of Luzon, Visayas, and the predominantly Visayan north and east Mindanao alongside the westernmost tip of Zamboanga.

Hispanic music in the Philippines derived from Iberian and some Mexican traditions, owing to the Philippine colony&#x27;s orientation as a distant entrepôt for resale of primarily Chinese and other Asian luxury goods across the Pacific to mainland New Spain (present-day Acapulco, Mexico). Aside from standardized genres are many precolonial musical forms syncretized with Catholic and general Hispanic idioms, typically involving in religious folk rituals. The Pasyon chants ubiquitous among Christian Filipinos preserve prehispanicized vocal styles, and invocations of patron saints throughout many towns inherited precolonial forms of ancestor and spirit worship. Examples include &quot;subli&quot; (Batangas), &quot;sinulog&quot; (Cebu), &quot;tinikling&quot; (Leyte), and &quot;bolibong kingking&quot; (Bohol).

=== Rondalla ===

The &quot;rondalla&quot; is a traditional string orchestra comprising four-string, mandolin-type instruments such as the banduria and laud; a guitar; a double bass; and often a drum for percussion. The rondalla has its origins in the Iberian &quot;rondalla&quot; tradition and is used to accompany several Hispanic-influenced song forms and dances.
=== Harana and kundiman ===

The &quot;harana&quot; and &quot;kundiman&quot; are popular lyrical songs dating back to the Spanish period and are customarily used in courtship rituals. The &quot;harana&quot; is rooted in the Mexican-Spanish from Spain, traditional and based on the rhythmic patterns of the habanera. The &quot;kundiman&quot;, meanwhile, has precolonial origins from the Tagalophone parts of the country, uses a triple meter rhythm, and is characterized by beginning in a minor key and shifting to a major one in the second half. Harana and kundiman are stylistically different. Whereas harana is in 2/4 time, kundiman is in 3/4. The formula is verse 1 on minor key followed by verse 2 on parallel major key midway through.

In the 1920s, &quot;harana&quot; and &quot;kundiman&quot; became more mainstream after performers such as Atang de la Rama, Jovita Fuentes, Conching Rosal, Sylvia La Torre, and Ruben Tagalog introduced them to a wider audience.

==Classical music==

Introduced during the Spanish colonial period, classical music was highly enjoyed by the wealthy elite class. From the latter part of the 19th century, the rise of the &quot;illustrados&quot; or the &quot;educated natives&quot; began to dominate the classical music scene. Such native composers include Julián Felipe Jose Canseco, Jr., Marcelo Adonay, Simplicio Solis, Fulgencio Tolentino, Bonifacio Abdon and .

The theatrical Spanish zarzuela was later adapted and localized in Philippine music. It was first introduced in 1879 and appeared in 1900. During the aftermath of the American invasion, the colonizers view the music form as &quot;seditious&quot; due to its use to promote nationalistic sentiments. Composers who specialized in zarzuela include Jose Estella and Bonifacio Abdon. The zarzuela was considered to be the predecessor of kundiman.

Formal classical music training appeared during the 1900s. Because of the new public school system, music was included in the curriculum. The establishment of music conservatories and colleges were implemented for tertiary education. The earlier schools include the Scholastica&#x27;s College (1906) and the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music (1916). Most of the graduates of these schools became leading classical composers such as Franscisco Buencamino, Nicanor Abelardo, Francisco Santiago, and Antonio Molina. 

Centro Scholar University founded in 1907 as Centro Escolar de las Señoritas had a Music department under the direction of the famous composer Francisco Buencamino, Sr. In 1930 the department was elevated to a Conservatory of Music with Buencamino as its first director. It was at this time that the CEU Rondalla and the CEU Choir were organized. 

Inspired by American neoclassism, contemporary methods were employed by Lucrecia Kasilag and Eliseo Pajaro in their classical works. However, it was Jose Maceda that made a Filipino expressionism that is distinct from the traditional European forms of classical music.

Between the late 20th century and the 21st century, notable classical composers include Ramon Pagayon Santos and Francisco Feliciano. Groups who specialized in classical music include the Philippine Youth Orchestra, Manila Symphony Orchestra, and the U.P. Symphony Orchestra.

== Choral music ==

Choral music has become an important part of Philippine music culture. It dates back to the choirs of churches that sung during mass in the old days. In the middle of the 20th century, performing choral groups started to emerge and increasingly become popular as time goes by. Aside from churches, universities, schools, and local communities have established choirs.

Philippine choral arrangers like Robert Delgado, Fidel Calalang, Lucio San Pedro, Eudenice Palaruan among others have included in the vast repertoires of choirs beautiful arrangements of OPM, folk songs, patriotic songs, novelty songs, love songs, and even foreign songs.

The Philippine Madrigal Singers (originally the University of the Philippines Madrigal Singers) is one of the most famous choral groups not only in the Philippines, but also worldwide. Winning international competitions, the group became one of the most formidable choral groups in the country. Other award-winning choral groups are the University of Santo Tomas Singers, the Philippine Meistersingers (Former Adventist University of the Philippines Ambassadors), the U.P. Singing Ambassadors, and the U.P. Concert Chorus, among others.

== Popular music ==

=== Manila sound ===
Manila sound is a musical genre that began in the mid-1970s in the city of Manila. The genre flourished and peaked in the mid to late-1970s. It is often considered the &quot;bright side&quot; of the Philippine martial law era and has influenced most of the modern genres in the country, being the forerunner to OPM.

=== Original Pilipino Music (OPM) ===

Original Pilipino Music, more commonly referred to as OPM, a commercial acronym coined by Danny Javier of the APO Hiking Society, originally referred only to the pop genre of music from the Philippines, predominantly ballads and novelty numbers, that became popular after the wane of its direct 1970s commercial predecessor, Manila sound. The term &quot;OPM&quot; became a catch-all description for all popular music of any genre composed, performed and recorded by Filipinos in the Philippines, originating from the Philippines.

Before the emergence of OPM in the 1970s, Philippine popular music through the 1950s and 1960s encompassed songs, mostly with vernacular lyrics and frequently with cinematic themes as recorded by artists such as Sylvia La Torre, Diomedes Maturan, Ric Manrique Jr., Ruben Tagalog, Helen Gamboa, Vilma Santos, Edgar Mortiz, and Carmen Camacho, among many others. There were exceptions, however, such as Pilita Corrales, dubbed &quot;Asia&#x27;s Queen of Song&quot;, whose popular releases included Cebuano, Tagalog, English and Spanish adaptations. From its heyday, OPM was entrenched in Manila, as Tagalog and English stood as the dominant languages. It was also heavily influenced from American country music. 

The country&#x27;s first songwriting competition, Metro Manila Popular Music Festival, was first established in 1977 and launched by the Popular Music Foundation of the Philippines. The event featured many prominent singers and songwriters during its time. It was held annually for seven years until its discontinuation in 1985. It was later revived in 1996 as the &quot;Metropop Song Festival&quot;, running for another seven years before being discontinued in 2003 due to the decline of its popularity. Another variation of the festival had been established called the Himig Handog contest which began in 2002, operated by ABS-CBN Corporation and its subsidiary music label Star Music (formerly Star Records).

Five such competitions were staged between 2000 and 2003 and was revived in 2013. Unlike their predecessors, the contest had different themes which reflect the type of song entries chosen as finalists each year. In 2012, the Philippine Popular Music Festival was launched and is said to be inspired by the first songwriting competition. Another songwriting competition for OPM music being held annually is the Bombo Music Festival, being conducted by the radio network Bombo Radyo, first conceived in 1985.

=== OPM in other Philippine languages ===

Recording artists of other regional languages, such as Cebuano, Kapampangan, Ilocano and others languages of the Philippines rarely broke into national prominence until the 1970s and after, particularly in the emergence of Bisrock (Visayan rock music); exemplified by &quot;1017&quot;, a Davao-based band and &quot;Maldita&quot;, a Zamboanga-based Chavacano band. 

The debut music video of &quot;Oras&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;) by Tarlac-based band Mernuts penetrated MTV Pilipinas, making it the first-ever Kapampangan music video to join the ranks of other mainstream Filipino music videos. &quot;RocKapampangan: The Birth of Philippine Kapampangan Rock&quot;, an album of modern remakes of Kapampangan folk extemporaneous songs by various Kapampangan bands was also launched in February 2008, and was regularly played via Kapampangan cable channel Infomax-8 and via one of Central Luzon&#x27;s biggest FM radio stations, GVFM 99.1. Inspired by what the locals call &quot;Kapampangan cultural renaissance&quot;, Angeles City-born balladeer Ronnie Liang rendered Kapampangan translations of some of his popular songs such as &quot;Ayli&quot; (Kapampangan version of &quot;Ngiti&quot;), and &quot;Ika&quot; (Kapampangan version of &quot;Ikaw&quot;) for his repackaged album.

Despite the growing clamor for non-Tagalog and non-English music and the greater representation of other Philippine languages, the local Philippine music industry, which is centered in Manila, is unforthcoming in venturing investments to other locations. Some of the major reasons for this include the language barrier, small market size, and socio-cultural emphasis away from regionalism in the Philippines. An example would be the Ilokano group The Bukros Singers, who swept through Ilocandia in the 1990s and became a precursor for other Ilokano performers into the 2000s, but rarely broke through other music markets in the Philippines.
=== Pinoy pop (P-pop) ===
From the 2010s to the present day, Philippine pop music or P-pop went through a huge resurgence, with increased quality, budget, investment and variety, mirroring that of the country&#x27;s rapid economic growth, and an accompanying social and cultural resurgence of its Asian identity. Heavy influence from K-pop and J-pop, Asian style ballads, idol groups, and EDM can be heard, with less reliance on Western genres, mirroring the Korean wave and similar Japanese wave popularity among young Filipinos and mainstream culture. Notable P-pop music artists who define the growth of this now mainstream genre include Regine Velasquez, Sarah Geronimo, Yeng Constantino, Erik Santos, KZ Tandingan, Moira Dela Torre, Morissette, SB19, and BINI.

== Pinoy rock ==
The United States occupied the Islands from 1898 until 1946 and introduced American blues, folk music, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll which became popular.  In the late 1950s, native performers adapted Tagalog lyrics for North American rock &amp; roll music, resulting in the seminal origins of Philippine rock. The most notable achievement in Philippine rock of the 1960s was the hit song &quot;Killer Joe&quot;, which propelled the group Rocky Fellers, reaching number 16 on the American radio charts.

===1970s===
Up until the 1970s, popular rock musicians wrote and produced songs primarily in English. In the early 1970s, rock music began to be written using local languages, with bands like the Juan Dela Cruz Band being among the first popular bands to do so. Mixing Tagalog and English lyrics within the same song was also popular, an example of which includes the song &quot;Ang Miss Universe Ng Buhay Ko (&quot;The Miss Universe of My Life&quot;) by the band Hotdog, who was a primary innovator in the Manila sound scene. The mixing of the two languages (known as &quot;Taglish&quot;), while common in casual speech in the Philippines, was seen as a bold move, but the success of Taglish in popular songs, including Sharon Cuneta&#x27;s first hit, &quot;Mr. DJ&quot;, broke the barrier.

Philippine rock musicians&#x27; acts were influenced by folk music and other various cultures, helping to lead to the 1978 breakthrough success of Freddie Aguilar. Aguilar&#x27;s &quot;Anak&quot; (&quot;Child&quot;), his debut recording, is the most commercially successful Filipino recording, and was popular throughout Asia and Europe, and has been translated into numerous languages by singers worldwide. Asin also broke into the music scene in the same period and was popular. Other similar artists included Sampaguita, Coritha, Florante, Mike Hanopol, and Heber Bartolome.

===1980s===
Folk rock became the Philippine protest music of the 1980s, and Aguilar&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; (&quot;My Country&quot;) became popular as an anthem during the 1986 EDSA Revolution. At the same time, a counterculture rejected the rise of politically focused lyrics. In Manila, an underground Do-It-Yourself hardcore punk, punk rock scene developed, led by bands like Betrayed, the Jerks, Urban Bandits, and Contras. The influence of new wave was also felt during these years, spearheaded by the Dawn.

===1990s===
The 1990s saw the emergence of Eraserheads, considered by many Filipinos as the number one Filipino musical artist. The wake of their success saw the emergence of a string of influential Filipino rock bands such as True Faith, Yano, Siakol, the Youth, Introvoys, After Image, Teeth, Parokya ni Edgar and Rivermaya, each of which mixed the influence of a variety of rock sub-genres into their style. A 1990s death metal emergence (Skychurch, Genital Grinder, Death After Birth, Disinterment, Kabaong ni Kamatayan, Mass Carnage, Apostate, Murdom, Exhumed, Sacrilege, Rumblebelly, Disinterment, Dethrone, Aroma) had bands as prominent fixtures at Club Dredd of the &quot;tunog kalye&quot; era.

By the 1990s, the hardcore punk scene had begun to die down in Manila. &quot;All the punks disappeared,&quot; recalls Jep Peligro, creator of &quot;Konspirazine&quot;, a zine published in the late 1990s and early 2000s documenting the local DIY music scene. Still, there were hubs of activity, such as in Laguna, a province southeast of Manila with a rich DIY punk culture, and the neighboring Cavite region, which is jointly called Strong South known as the punk capital of the Philippines.

===2000s===
Filipino rock in the 2000s also developed to include punk rock, hardcore punk, emo, hard rock, heavy metal, and alternative rock, with acts like Razorback, Wolfgang, Greyhoundz, Slapshock, Queso, Typecast, PILEDRIVER, Chicosci, Kamikazee, Bamboo, Franco, Urbandub, Tanya Markova, Kiko Machine, and the progressive bands Paradigm, Fuseboxx, Earthmover, and Eternal Now.

===2010s===
The 2010s saw the rise of various unsigned acts of different subgenres from another format of rock, independent music which included indie acts such as Autotelic, Ang Bandang Shirley, the Ransom Collective, Ben&amp;Ben, December Avenue, IV of Spades, Munimuni, and the Purplechickens among others.

Rock festivals have emerged, becoming annual events for rock and metal enthusiasts. One big event is the Pulp Summer Slam where local rock/metal bands and international bands such as Lamb of God, Anthrax, Death Angel, and Arch Enemy have performed. Another all-local annual event, Rakrakan Festival, is one where over 100 Pinoy rock acts perform.

The neo-traditional genre in Filipino music is also gaining popularity, with artists such as Joey Ayala, Grace Nono, Bayang Barrios, Kadangyan, and Pinikpikan reaping relative commercial success while utilizing the traditional musical sounds of Indigenous peoples in the Philippines.

===2020s===
The 2020s gave birth of new breed of rock and indie artists/bands: Magnus Haven, Bandang Lapis, the Vowels They Orbit and Nobita. Zild Benitez, who previously played for IV of Spades, also made his solo recordings.

== Pinoy jazz ==

===Early jazz by Filipinos===

Jazz music in the Philippines originated during the American occupation of the Philippines between 1910s and 1920s. At this period, Filipinos began experimenting with Afro-American and Hispano-Filipino music. One of the notable musicians of this age was the self-proclaimed &quot;King of Jazz&quot;, Luis Borromeo. The music produced by Borromeo was ragtime which was common among his contemporaries. Other composers such as classical composers like Francisco Santiago and Jose Estella began fusing jazz elements, which was considered &quot;modern music&quot; at the time, and created new genres of dance music such as &quot;himno one-step&quot;, &quot;Filipino foxtrot&quot;, and &quot;‘Filipino tango-foxtrots&quot;. During the 1920s, with the arrival of recording companies such as Parlophone and with the gained momentum of the aforementioned hybrid dance genres, many department stores and shopping streets especially at Escolta, Manila began selling and advertising for new &quot;Filipino Dance Records&quot;. Furthermore, the original compositions of Filipino bassist Angel Peña in the 1950s became a catalyst for the &quot;Jazz Friends&quot; to converge, consisting of alto saxophonist Lito Molina, pianist Emil Mijares, drummer Tony Velarde and other jazz orchestra professionals. 

===Adobo Jazz===
According to the Filipinas Heritage Library, &quot;Pinoy Jazz&quot; became a unique genre because it mixed Filipino folk music elements with the emerging modern jazz jazz trends of the 70s and onwards, with the &quot;JEM Records&quot; albums of Eddie Munji and Ryan Cayabyab music in the mid-1970s. A renewed interest in their recordings caused a resurgence of Pinoy Jazz, reinvented as &quot;Adobo Jazz&quot; in the late 1990s and after. The initial impetus was provided by groups such as &quot;JRCOBB Jazz Chamber&quot;; and bands such as &quot;WDOUJI&quot; ( Witch Doctors of Underground Jazz Improvization) that released an award-winning album in 2002 entitled &quot;Ground Zero&quot; (under the now-defunct N/A Records label); and &quot;Buhay&quot; (under the now-defunct Star Records label), led by saxophonist Tots Tolentino. After-hours jazz jams became a norm in venues such as Freedom Bar (located along Anonas Street in Cubao, Quezon City) during the early 2000s; and Tago Jazz Cafe in the 2010s, (also located in Cubao) that became incubators for emerging jazz groups and recording talent.

Pinoy Jazz paved the way for post-modern innovations, most notably the Filipino jazz &quot;supergroup&quot; Johnny Alegre Affinity, releasing its eponymous debut album in 2005 under the UK-based Candid Records. Other notables were guitarist Bob Aves with his ethno-infused jazz recordings, and the spoken-word fusion ensemble Radioactive Sago Project also displayed jazz underpinnings. The Kapampangan singer likewise cultivated his persona as a Filipino jazz vocalist to win the London International Jazz Competition for Vocalists in 2006. Among the female jazz singer-songwriters, the British-Filipino Mishka Adams became very popular as a flagship artist of Candid Records, releasing two well-received albums. The multi-awarded music of In the new millennium, &quot;Humanfolk&quot; became a cause for fusing genuine indigenous music rhythms and instrumentation with urban folk music and jazz harmonization.

== Other genres ==
Many other genres are growing in popularity in the Philippine music scene, including several alternative groups and tribal bands promoting cultural awareness in the Philippines.

=== Hip hop ===

Filipino hip-hop is hip hop music performed by musicians of Filipino descent, both in the Philippines and overseas, especially by Filipino-Americans. The Philippines is known to have the first hip-hop music scene in Asia, emerging in the early 1980s, largely due to the country&#x27;s historical connections with the United States where hip-hop originated. Rap music released in the Philippines has appeared in different languages such as Tagalog, Chavacano, Cebuano, Ilocano, and English. In the Philippines, Francis M, Andrew E., Vincent Daffalong, Michael V., Denmark, and Gloc-9 are cited as the most influential rappers in the country, being the first to release mainstream rap albums. A new breed of hip hop/rap/trap artists like Abra, Bassilyo, Curse 1, Flict-G, Smugglaz, Dello, Loonie, Shehyee, Shanti Dope, 1096 Gang, Al James, Because, Bugoy na Koykoy, Nik Makino, Honcho, Skusta Clee, Flow G, Ex Battalion, ALLMO$T, O.C. Dawgs and Ez Mil would later follow in the early 2010s to present.

=== Novelty pop ===
Pinoy novelty songs became popular in the 1970s up to the early 1980s. Popular novelty singers around this time were Reycard Duet, Fred Panopio and Yoyoy Villame. Novelty pop acts in the 1990s and 2000s included Michael V., Bayani Agbayani, Grin Department, Masculados (&quot;Lagot Ka!&quot;), Blakdyak, Vhong Navarro, Lito Camo, Sexbomb Girls, Joey de Leon (&quot;Itaktak Mo&quot;), Viva Hot Babes, and Willie Revillame.

=== Latin and bossa-nova ===

Afro-Cuban a.k.a. &quot;latin and bossa-nova rhythms in Philippine popular music became pervasive through the Philippines&#x27; post-Liberation years and onwards. Performers such as Annie Brazil and her son Richard Merk, the Katindig family of musicians (), Bo Razon, Eileen Sison and Sitti, achieved popularity and commercial success with latin and bossa-nova inflected live performances and recordings.

=== Reggae ===

While there has long been a flourishing underground reggae and ska scene, particularly in Baguio, it was only recently that such genres were accepted into the mainstream scene. Acts like Tropical Depression, Brownman Revival, Put3ska, Roots Revival of Cebu, and the Brown Outfit Bureau of Tarlac City have been instrumental in popularizing what is called &quot;Island Riddims&quot;. There is also a burgeoning mod revival, spearheaded by Juan Pablo Dream and a large indie-pop scene.

=== Electronica and ambient ===
Electronic music began in the mid-1990s in the Manila underground spearheaded by such acts as Manolet Dario of the Consortium. In 2010, local artists started to create electropop songs themselves. As of now, most electronic songs are used in commercials. The only radio station so far that purely plays electronic music is 107.9 U Radio. The 2010s also saw the rise of budots, popularly known as &quot;bombtech&quot; from Davao City, regarded as the first &quot;Filipino-fied&quot; EDM, as well as high-profile nightclub venues such as The Palace Manila (BGC, Taguig) and Cove Manila (Okada Manila in Parañaque). Indie electronic producers, DJs, and artists like that of Somedaydream, Borhuh, Kidwolf, Zelijah, John Sedano, MVRXX, MRKIII, Bojam, CRWN, NINNO, Kidthrones, and Jess Connelly have also gained popularity. Some mainstream club DJs, including the likes of Ace Ramos, Mars Miranda, Marc Marasigan, Martin Pulgar, Katsy Lee, Patty Tiu, and David Ardiente, has also made their names on popular club concerts and festivals which featured international DJs. Ato Mariano, an adherent of what he describes as &quot;earth music&quot;, released a digital album containing sound samples of indigenous instruments that included various percussion.

=== Bangsamoro pop ===
Centered in Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur and Soccsksargen, an underground pop music scene known as Bangsamoro pop (B-pop; also called Moropop) emerged in the late 2000s, gaining local radio listeners and fans in the area, but also attracted some worldwide following among Maguindanaon diaspora thanks to YouTube. Notable B-pop artists include Datu Khomeini Camsa Bansuan (dubbed as the &quot;King of Moro Songs&quot;), Tamtax, Shaira (dubbed as the &quot;Queen of Bangsamoro Pop&quot;, known for her song &quot;Selos&quot;), and Johnson Ampatuan, among others who perform in such venues as barangay basketball courts, residential neighborhoods, birthday or wedding parties and even remotest areas such as forest villages rather than clubs. Similar to a dangdut music scene in Indonesia, the genre&#x27;s lyrics are mainly written in both Maguindanaon and Tagalog, and has influences from other genres, especially EDM. Because Bangsamoro is a Muslim-populated region in the Philippines, female Bangsamoro pop artists often faced criticisms from ultra-conservative Muslim communities in the region especially from its religious scholars called ulamas, for showing sexual forms of dance such as twerking onstage and for wearing just shirts and jeans (even torn jeans) performing on public, instead of including hijab and abaya, concerning religious morality.

== Music as protest in the Philippines ==
The Philippines has had a long history of songs associated with associated with protest and social change, dating back to the days of the Philippine Revolution, during which important protest music included patriotic marches and the traditional Filipino kundiman. One of the most notable examples of protest songs from this early period were Julián Felipe&#x27;s 1898 composition &quot;Marcha Nacional Filipina&quot;, which was combined with José Palma&#x27;s 1899 poem &quot;Filipinas&quot; to create Lupang Hinirang, now the Philippines&#x27; official National anthem. Another song that nearly became the Philippines&#x27; national anthem was Julio Nakpil&#x27;s 1896 composition Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan (&quot;Honorable Hymn of the Tagalog Nation/People&quot;) which was commissioned by Andres Bonifacio as the anthem of the revolutionary Tagalog Republic.

The song &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; was an important protest song from the American Occupation period, with the Tagalog version composed in 1929 by Constancio de Guzmán with lyrics attributed to José Corazón de Jesús based on a Spanish piece attributed to &quot;Propaganda Movement&quot; hero José Alejandrino. It was later banned by Marcos when it was deemed seditious under Martial Law, but it became an important rallying cry when protesters chose to sing it at funeral after the 1983 Assassination of Ninoy Aquino.

The use of music as protest became more widespread and began to incorporate popular, folk, and rock music during the years of the Marcos dictatorship, especially after the human rights abuses that came after the 1972 proclamation of Martial Law. The trend towards the popular use of music as protest continued until Marcos was deposed during the 1986 People Power revolution, after which the use of songs as protest or as a means of advocating social change became a constant feature of Filipino musical culture.

<text>The County of Victoria, or Victoria County, was a county in the Canadian province of Ontario. It was formed in 1854 as &quot;The United Counties of Peterborough and Victoria&quot;, and separated from Peterborough in 1863. In 2001, the county was dissolved and reformed as the city of Kawartha Lakes. While British settlement began in 1821, the area that was encompassed by Victoria County had already been inhabited by First Nations, including by the Wendat.

== History ==
The history of Victoria County began with the passing of the Constitutional Act in 1791, dividing Canada into two provinces: Upper Canada (present day Ontario) and Lower Canada (present day Québec); and appointing a lieutenant-governor for each.

The first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada was Colonel John Graves Simcoe, who surveyed the province and set out tracts of land for immigrants with genuine interests. Before the land that became Victoria County could be surveyed, however, speculators had Simcoe removed from office in 1796, and the land was secured from settlement for over 20 years.

Following the War of 1812, a large wave of immigration prompted the province to purchase more land from local Indian tribes. On 5 November 1818, six Mississauga chiefs, Buckquaquet of the Eagles, Pishikinse of the Reindeers, Paudash of the Cranes, Cahgahkishinse of the Pike, Cahgageewin of the Snakes, and Pininse of the White Oaks, met in Port Hope. There they surrendered the rights to over four thousand square kilometres of land, known as the &quot;Mississauga Tract&quot;. In exchange, the Indians (numbering about 400) were to receive $750 per year in goods. However, the government later changed this to $10 per year for each living person born before the deal was signed.

The Mississauga Tract included all of Victoria and Peterborough counties, as well as parts of 28 adjacent townships. Following the purchase, the land became Newcastle District in 1802. In 1845, it was renamed Colborne District consisting of the County of Peterborough. In 1851, Peterborough County was divided into the counties of Peterborough and Victoria, which were united for municipal purposes as the United Counties of Peterborough and Victoria.


A plebiscite was authorized in 1856 to facilitate the creation of a provisional county council for Victoria, but, as the united counties council delayed conducting it, a further Act was passed in 1861 to compel its being held, following which the provisional council was formed. and its formal separation took place in 1863.

Further townships were surveyed in the following years that were attached to the County, extending its reach northwards. In 1868, the townships of Ryde, Draper, Macaulay, Stephenson, Brunel, McLean and Oakley were detached from the County and transferred to the new District of Muskoka, and the townships of Stisted, Chaffey, Franklin and Ridout were detached in a similar manner in 1873. They were not withdrawn for municipal purposes until their annexation to Simcoe County in 1877. The townships of Anson, Hindon and Lutterworth were also withdrawn from the County in 1874 and transferred to the new Provisional County of Haliburton.

In 1974, as a result of the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham, Manvers Township was withdrawn from Durham County and transferred to Victoria County.

On 1 January 2001, Victoria County was dissolved, and its townships and incorporated communities were amalgamated to form the City of Kawartha Lakes, a name chosen because of the prominence of the lakes in the geography of the region.

==Organization before amalgamation in 2001==
It encompassed 

=== Townships ===
Victoria County consisted of 13 separate townships and 6 incorporated villages with their own local governments.

== Demographics ==

The population is mostly rural, with only 34% living in urban areas.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Colonization roads ===
Victoria County was first opened up to settlement in the 1821.
At this time, the primary routes for entering the county-to-be were narrow trails. Settlers were offered land on the condition that they help further the progress of concession roads into the region. This was often met with the bare minimum, and progress was slow.

The Land Act of 1853 provided funding for the development of roads throughout the wilderness of Upper Canada. Grants were administered by the Department of Agriculture to survey and build the new roads. The roads followed the tradition of old Roman roads, and cut through the wilderness in a straight line, veering only when the terrain was impassable, but cutting through swamps and hills otherwise. Four primary roads were built: the Cameron Road, the Bobcaygeon Road, the Monck Road, and the Portage Road.

http://www.ontariogenealogy.com/Victoria/history/victoriacountypioneers2.html

The Cameron road, now mostly encompassed by Highway 35, provided access from Lake Ontario to the northern limits of Victoria;

The Bobcaygeon Road, begun in 1853, traversed north and south along the present-day eastern boundary of the region, and is mostly encompassed by former Highway 121;

The Monck Road, which connected Lake Couchiching to Bancroft, encompassed partially by former Highway 503, now City Road 45;

The Portage Road, connecting Lake Simcoe to Balsam Lake, encompassed entirely by former Highway 48, now City Road 48

==Education==
At one time the Victoria County Board of Education provided educational services. In 1999 it was amalgamated into the Trillium Lakelands District School Board.

<text>Peterborough County is a county and census division located in Southern Ontario, Canada. The county seat is the City of Peterborough, which is independent of the county.

The southern section of the county is mix of agriculture, urban and lakefront properties. The northern section of the county is mostly sparsely populated wilderness, with numerous rivers and lakes mostly within Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park.

The county contains the Kawarthas, a major tourist region.

== History ==
===Origins and evolution===
In 1615, Samuel de Champlain was one of the first western explorers who traveled through the area, coming down from Lake Chemong and portaging down a trail, which is approximated by present-day Chemong Road, to the Otonabee River and stayed for a brief time near the present-day site of Bridgenorth, just north of Peterborough.

The area was initially part of Northumberland County, which was formed by proclamation of the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe in 1792, and defined by statute in 1798. In 1802, Northumberland was included in the Newcastle District. In 1841, the northern part of the District was detached to form the Colborne District, with the northern portion of Northumberland county made into the new County of Peterborough. It consisted of the following territory:

The county was named in honor of Col. Peter Robinson, who in 1825 brought 2,000 settlers from Ireland. The route taken was by way of Port Hope, Rice Lake and the Otonabee River, the same route used by the first settlers that entered this region in 1818.

The centre of the County was originally the courthouse, which is still considered an important historical site.

In 1851, Peterborough County was divided into the counties of Peterborough and Victoria, which were united for municipal purposes as the United Counties of Peterborough and Victoria.


A plebiscite was authorized in 1856 to facilitate the creation of a provisional county council for Victoria, but, as the united counties council delayed conducting it, a further Act was passed in 1861 to compel its being held, following which the provisional council was formed. and its formal separation took place in 1863.

Further townships were surveyed, thus extending the reach of the County northwards. In 1874, the townships of Bruton, Cardiff, Dysart, Dudley, Glamorgan, Guilford, Harburn, Harcourt, Minden, Monmouth, Snowden and Stanhope were withdrawn from the County and transferred to the new Provisional County of Haliburton.

After the transfer of the northern townships to Haliburton, the remainder of the County consisted of the following:

The Town of Peterborough became a City in 1905, and was subsequently withdrawn from the County for municipal purposes.

In 1974, as a result of the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham, the township of Cavan and the village of Millbrook were withdrawn from Durham County, and the township of South Monaghan was withdrawn from Northumberland County, to be transferred to Peterborough County.

===Current municipalities===
As a consequence of the Common Sense Revolution in Ontario, the County was restructured into the following municipalities during the period 1997-2004:

* Township of Douro-Dummer
* Township of Havelock-Belmont-Methuen
* Township of North Kawartha
* Township of Otonabee-South Monaghan

<doc id="318739" wikidata="Q2034742" url="?curid=318739" title="Athenian League">
<text>The Athenian League was an English amateur football league for clubs in and around London. The league was originally to be called the Corinthian League, but this name was rejected by the Football Association. It was formed in 1912 with ten clubs, but had to close down in 1914 due to the onset of World War I. When it reformed in 1920, only three of the previous teams rejoined. Clubs left and joined the league at a rate of about one a year, with a number leaving to join the Isthmian League, the strongest amateur league in the London area. Total membership remained fairly stable at between twelve and sixteen clubs until 1963, when it absorbed most of the clubs from two rival leagues, the Corinthian League (most of whose former clubs formed Division One) and the Delphian League (most of whose former clubs formed Division Two). The existing division was renamed the Premier Division.

Over the following years it lost many clubs to stronger leagues, particularly the Isthmian League and Southern League, and successive waves of Isthmian League expansion in 1973, 1977 and 1984 finally forced the league to disband. The league was amongst the first in England to be sponsored by an external company when, in the late 1970s, it was billed as the Kingsmead Athenian League.

==Champions==
The champion clubs were as follows:
In 1963 the league expanded to three divisions

In 1973 the league was reduced to two divisions

In 1977 the league was reduced to a single division

In mathematics, hyperbolic space of dimension &quot;n&quot; is the unique simply connected, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature equal to −1. It is homogeneous, and satisfies the stronger property of being a symmetric space. There are many ways to construct it as an open subset of formula_1 with an explicitly written Riemannian metric; such constructions are referred to as models. Hyperbolic 2-space, H2, which was the first instance studied, is also called the hyperbolic plane. 

It is also sometimes referred to as Lobachevsky space or Bolyai–Lobachevsky space after the names of the author who first published on the topic of hyperbolic geometry. Sometimes the qualificative &quot;real&quot; is added to distinguish it from complex hyperbolic spaces. 

Hyperbolic space serves as the prototype of a Gromov hyperbolic space, which is a far-reaching notion including differential-geometric as well as more combinatorial spaces via a synthetic approach to negative curvature. Another generalisation is the notion of a CAT(−1) space.

== Formal definition and models ==

=== Definition ===
The formula_2-dimensional hyperbolic space or hyperbolic formula_2-space, usually denoted formula_4, is the unique simply connected, formula_2-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold with a constant negative sectional curvature equal to −1. The unicity means that any two Riemannian manifolds that satisfy these properties are isometric to each other. It is a consequence of the Killing–Hopf theorem.

=== Models of hyperbolic space ===

To prove the existence of such a space as described above one can explicitly construct it, for example as an open subset of formula_1 with a Riemannian metric given by a simple formula. There are many such constructions or models of hyperbolic space, each suited to different aspects of its study. They are isometric to each other according to the previous paragraph, and in each case an explicit isometry can be explicitly given. Here is a list of the better-known models which are described in more detail in their namesake articles:
* Poincaré half-space model: this is the upper-half space formula_7 with the metric formula_8
* Poincaré disc model: this is the unit ball of formula_1 with the metric formula_10. The isometry to the half-space model can be realised by a homography sending a point of the unit sphere to infinity. 
* Hyperboloid model: In contrast with the previous two models this realises hyperbolic formula_2-space as isometrically embedded inside the formula_12-dimensional Minkowski space (which is not a Riemannian but rather a Lorentzian manifold). More precisely, looking at the quadratic form formula_13 on formula_14, its restriction to the tangent spaces of the upper sheet of the hyperboloid given by formula_15 are definite positive, hence they endow it with a Riemannian metric that turns out to be of constant curvature −1. The isometry to the previous models can be realised by stereographic projection from the hyperboloid to the plane formula_16, taking the vertex from which to project to be formula_17 for the ball and a point at infinity in the cone formula_18 inside projective space for the half-space. 
* Beltrami–Klein model: This is another model realised on the unit ball of formula_1; rather than being given as an explicit metric it is usually presented as obtained by using stereographic projection from the hyperboloid model in Minkowski space to its horizontal tangent plane (that is, formula_20) from the origin formula_21.
* Symmetric space: Hyperbolic formula_2-space can be realised as the symmetric space of the simple Lie group formula_23 (the group of isometries of the quadratic form formula_24 with positive determinant); as a set the latter is the coset space formula_25. The isometry to the hyperboloid model is immediate through the action of the connected component of formula_23 on the hyperboloid.

== Geometric properties ==

=== Parallel lines ===
Hyperbolic space, developed independently by Nikolai Lobachevsky, János Bolyai and Carl Friedrich Gauss, is a geometric space analogous to Euclidean space, but such that Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate is no longer assumed to hold. Instead, the parallel postulate is replaced by the following alternative (in two dimensions):
* Given any line &quot;L&quot; and point &quot;P&quot; not on &quot;L&quot;, there are at least two distinct lines passing through &quot;P&quot; that do not intersect &quot;L&quot;.
It is then a theorem that there are infinitely many such lines through &quot;P&quot;. This axiom still does not uniquely characterize the hyperbolic plane up to isometry; there is an extra constant, the curvature , that must be specified. However, it does uniquely characterize it up to homothety, meaning up to bijections that only change the notion of distance by an overall constant. By choosing an appropriate length scale, one can thus assume, without loss of generality, that .

=== Euclidean embeddings ===
The hyperbolic plane cannot be isometrically embedded into Euclidean 3-space by Hilbert&#x27;s theorem. On the other hand the Nash embedding theorem implies that hyperbolic n-space can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space of larger dimension (5 for the hyperbolic plane by the Nash embedding theorem). 

When isometrically embedded to a Euclidean space every point of a hyperbolic space is a saddle point.

=== Volume growth and isoperimetric inequality ===
The volume of balls in hyperbolic space increases exponentially with respect to the radius of the ball rather than polynomially as in Euclidean space. Namely, if formula_27 is any ball of radius formula_28 in formula_4 then:formula_30
where formula_31 is the total volume of the Euclidean formula_32-sphere of radius 1.

The hyperbolic space also satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality, that is there exists a constant formula_33 such that any embedded disk whose boundary has length formula_28 has area at most formula_35. This is to be contrasted with Euclidean space where the isoperimetric inequality is quadratic.

=== Other metric properties ===

There are many more metric properties of hyperbolic space that differentiate it from Euclidean space. Some can be generalised to the setting of Gromov-hyperbolic spaces, which is a generalisation of the notion of negative curvature to general metric spaces using only the large-scale properties. A finer notion is that of a CAT(−1)-space.

== Hyperbolic manifolds ==
Every complete, connected, simply connected manifold of constant negative curvature −1 is isometric to the real hyperbolic space H&quot;n&quot;. As a result, the universal cover of any closed manifold &quot;M&quot; of constant negative curvature −1, which is to say, a hyperbolic manifold, is H&quot;n&quot;. Thus, every such &quot;M&quot; can be written as H&quot;n&quot;/Γ, where Γ is a torsion-free discrete group of isometries on H&quot;n&quot;. That is, Γ is a lattice in .

=== Riemann surfaces ===
Two-dimensional hyperbolic surfaces can also be understood according to the language of Riemann surfaces. According to the uniformization theorem, every Riemann surface is either elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic. Most hyperbolic surfaces have a non-trivial fundamental group ; the groups that arise this way are known as Fuchsian groups. The quotient space H2/Γ of the upper half-plane modulo the fundamental group is known as the Fuchsian model of the hyperbolic surface. The Poincaré half plane is also hyperbolic, but is simply connected and noncompact. It is the universal cover of the other hyperbolic surfaces.

The analogous construction for three-dimensional hyperbolic surfaces is the Kleinian model.

<doc id="318744" wikidata="Q224002" url="?curid=318744" title="Édouard Lalo">
<text>Édouard-Victoire-Antoine Lalo (27 January 182322 April 1892) was a French composer, violist, violinist, and academic teacher. His most celebrated piece is the &quot;Symphonie Espagnole&quot;, a five-movement concerto for violin and orchestra that remains a popular work in the standard repertoire.

== Biography ==
Lalo was born in Lille, in the northernmost part of France. He attended the conservatoire in that city in his youth. Beginning at age 16, he studied at the Paris conservatoire under François Antoine Habeneck. Habeneck conducted student concerts at the conservatoire from 1806 and became the founding conductor of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire in 1828.

For several years, Lalo worked as a string player and teacher in Paris. In 1848, he joined with friends to found the Armingaud Quartet, in which he played the viola and later, second violin. His earliest surviving compositions are songs and chamber works. Two early symphonies were destroyed.

In 1865, Lalo married Julie Besnier de Maligny, a contralto from Brittany. She encouraged Lalo&#x27;s early interest in opera and led him to compose works for the stage, most notably the opera, &quot;Le Roi d&#x27;Ys&quot;. Despite their originality, these works were never really popular and incurred criticism for being &quot;too progressive&quot; and &quot;Wagnerian&quot;. This reception led Lalo to dedicate most of his career to the composition of chamber music, which was gradually coming into vogue in France, as well as to composing works for orchestra.

Lalo&#x27;s distinctive style has earned him a degree of popularity. &quot;Symphonie Espagnole&quot; for violin and orchestra still enjoys a prominent place in the repertoire of violinists. Cello Concerto in D minor is revived occasionally. His Symphony in G minor was a favourite of Sir Thomas Beecham and has occasionally been championed by later conductors. 

His music is notable for its strong melodies and colourful orchestration, with a Germanic solidity that distinguishes him from other French composers of his era. Such works as the &quot;Scherzo in D minor&quot;, one of his most colourful pieces, embody his distinctive style and strong expressive bent.
&quot;Le Roi d&#x27;Ys&quot;, an opera based on the Breton legend of Ys, is Lalo&#x27;s most complex and ambitious creation. (This same legend inspired Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La cathédrale engloutie&quot;.) Lalo became a member of the Legion of Honour in 1873. &quot;Le Roi d&#x27;Ys&quot; was not initially considered performable and was not staged until 1888, when Lalo was 65 years old.

Lalo died in Paris in 1892, leaving several unfinished works, including his opera, &quot;La Jacquerie&quot;, that was completed by Arthur Coquard. He was interred at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Lalo&#x27;s son Pierre (6 September 18669 June 1943) was a music critic who wrote for &quot;Le Temps&quot; and other French periodicals from 1898 until his death.

== Compositions ==
== References in modern culture ==
In 1962, composer Maurice Jarre used a theme from Lalo&#x27;s &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; for the exotic score to &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.

English progressive rock group The Nice used a melody from Lalo&#x27;s Symphonie espagnole for its recording &quot;Diary of an Empty Day&quot; that is found on its third album &quot;Nice&quot;. Most of the lyrics are concerned with the inability of the writer to &quot;find words for this music&quot;.

Part of Lalo&#x27;s Cello Concerto in D minor was used in the second season of Mozart in the Jungle.

<text>Ripley&#x27;s Game (1974) is a psychological thriller by Patricia Highsmith, the third in her series about the con artist and murderer Tom Ripley.

==Plot summary==
Tom Ripley continues enjoying his wealthy lifestyle in France with his wife, Heloïse. He spends his days living comfortably at his estate, Belle Ombre, until an associate, American criminal Reeves Minot, asks him to commit murder for him. Ripley—who &quot;detest[s] murder, unless absolutely necessary&quot;—turns down the offer of $96,000 for two hits, and Minot goes back to Hamburg.

The previous month, Ripley had gone to a party in Fontainebleau, where he was insulted by the host, Jonathan Trevanny, a poor British picture framer suffering from myeloid leukemia. As revenge, Ripley suggests to Minot that he might try to persuade Trevanny to commit the murders. To ensure that the plan will work, Ripley starts a rumor that Trevanny has only months to live and suggests that Minot fabricate evidence that Trevanny&#x27;s leukemia has worsened, though Minot does not. Trevanny, who fears his death will leave his wife and son destitute, accepts Minot&#x27;s offer of a visit to a medical specialist in Hamburg. There, he is persuaded to commit a murder in exchange for money.

After carrying out the contract—a shooting in a crowded U-Bahn station—Trevanny insists that he is through as a hired gun. Minot invites him to Munich, where he visits another doctor. Minot persuades Trevanny to kill a Mafia boss, this time on a train using either a garrotte or a gun. Trevanny reluctantly gives in and gets on the train. He resolves to shoot the &quot;mafioso&quot; and commit suicide before he can be caught, asking Minot to ensure that his wife gets the money. But before he can go through with the hit, Ripley, who is fascinated by the whole situation, shows up and executes the &quot;mafioso&quot; himself. He asks Trevanny not to tell Minot that he has &quot;assisted&quot; with the assassination.

Trevanny&#x27;s wife, Simone, discovers a Swiss bank book with a large sum in his name and suspects that he is hiding something. She links the rumor about her husband&#x27;s condition to Ripley and asks Trevanny to tell her how he has been making so much money. Trevanny is unable to explain and asks Ripley to help concoct a credible story. Ripley acknowledges his role in Trevanny&#x27;s dilemma and promises to shepherd him through the ordeal. The Mafia become suspicious of Minot and bomb his house, prompting him to flee. Ripley begins to fear Mafia revenge when he receives suspicious phone calls. After sending Heloïse and their housekeeper away, Ripley asks Trevanny to help him deal with any reprisals at Belle Ombre.

When two Mafia hitmen turn up, Ripley kills one and forces the other to phone his boss in Milan and say that Ripley is not the man they are after before being executed. Simone then shows up at the house demanding answers, discovers the corpses and is sent away in a taxi. Ripley and Trevanny drive to a remote village to burn the corpses in their own car. A few days later, Ripley visits Trevanny&#x27;s house, where a quartet of Mafia gunmen appear. One of them opens fire on Ripley, but Trevanny steps in front of him and is mortally wounded; he dies in Ripley&#x27;s car on the way to hospital. Ripley is unsure whether Trevanny&#x27;s action was by accident or design.

A few months later, Ripley encounters Simone in Fontainebleau, and she spits at him. He realizes that Simone has accepted her husband&#x27;s blood money and in doing so has remained silent about her suspicions of Ripley&#x27;s instigation of the entire affair.

==Reception==
In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote that the novel &quot;gets off to a very strong beginning&quot; and described how he appreciated the plot once Ripley set it in motion and stood back. He concluded:

<text>Sir Dennis Holme Robertson (23 May 1890 – 21 April 1963) was an English economist who taught at Cambridge and London Universities.

== Biography ==
Robertson, the son of a Church of England clergyman, was born in Lowestoft and educated as a scholar of Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read Classics and Economics, graduating in 1912.

Robertson worked closely with John Maynard Keynes in the 1920s and 1930s, during the years when Keynes was developing many of the ideas that later were incorporated in his &quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;. Keynes wrote that at that time, working with Robertson, it was good to work with someone who had a &quot;completely first class mind&quot;. Robertson was the first to use the term &quot;liquidity trap&quot;. Ultimately however, differences of temperament and views about economic theory and practice (especially in the 1937 debate over the savings-investment relationship in the General Theory) led to some estrangement between the two men.

Robertson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1945 and the American Philosophical Society in 1949.

Robertson died of a heart attack at Cambridge on 21 April 1963.

<doc id="318749" wikidata="Q5718406" url="?curid=318749" title="Henry Botterell">
<text>Henry John Lawrence Botterell (November 7, 1896 – January 3, 2003) was a Canadian fighter pilot who served in the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and then in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during World War I. When he died at the age of 106, the Canadian Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs, among others, believed he was the last surviving pilot in the world to have seen action in the Great War.

==Pre-war life and career==
Henry Botterell was born in Ottawa to Henry and Annie Botterell. His father, a civil servant, died of pneumonia when Botterell was still a young boy. He attended Lisgar Collegiate Institute before beginning a career in banking. Prior to his war service, Botterell worked as a clerk at the Bank of North America (now the Bank of Montreal).

==World War I service==

===Entry and training===
In 1916, he joined the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) as a civilian flying trainee. His entry was facilitated by his sister Edith, who worked in the office of Admiral Charles Kingsmill. Botterell was sent to England for training. Around this time, his older brother Edward, who had played football for the Toronto Argonauts, was killed in action in France while serving with the 48th Highlanders of Canada.

On May 16, 1917, Botterell became a Probationary Flight Officer with the RNAS, where he was given the nickname &quot;Nap&quot; because of his supposed resemblance to Napoleon. He received his wings on August 15, 1917, and was awarded Royal Aero Club certificate number 5093.

===No. 8 Naval Squadron===
In September, Botterell joined No. 8 Naval Squadron. The squadron, which was usually referred to as Naval 8, was soon posted to France in support of the Royal Flying Corps. Botterell&#x27;s immediate superior was also a Canadian, the flying ace Flight Commander James White. The squadron was commanded by another ace, Squadron Commander Christopher Draper, who was later known as the &quot;Mad Major&quot; for his habit of flying under bridges.

On September 18, 1917, Botterell&#x27;s second operational flight as a pilot ended in a crash at Dunkirk when the engine of his Sopwith Pup failed. He sustained head injuries, a fractured leg and broken teeth. After six months in hospital, he was discharged and sent back to Canada.

En route, Botterell ran into some of his former colleagues from Naval 8 in London. They arranged for him to be sent to Manston in Kent to try to re-qualify as a pilot. After 10 hours of refresher training, he was approved to start flying once more and was sent to Serny on the Western Front, where he rejoined No. 8 Naval Squadron, now renamed No. 208 Squadron RAF. He served with them from May 11 to November 27, 1918, flying a variety of missions in different aircraft. He flew patrols and fought over Serny, Tramecourt, Arras, Foucaucourt and Estrées. In 60 days between June and August 1918, he flew 91 sorties.

Botterell&#x27;s sole air victory was a German observation balloon, which was well-defended by anti-aircraft guns, on August 29, 1918, near Arras. He was returning from dropping four bombs on the railway station at Vitry when he saw the balloon. Putting his Sopwith Camel into a dive, he fired 400 machine-gun rounds at the balloon, setting it aflame. The German observer parachuted to safety.

During his service, Botterell flew a variety of planes, including several Sopwith types (Pup, Camel and Snipe), the RE8, the SE5, the Claude Grahame-White and the Maurice Farman. He logged 251 combat hours.

At the end of the war, Botterell was a flight lieutenant with the Royal Air Force (the Royal Flying Corps and RNAS had been combined on April 1, 1918, to form the RAF).

After his return to Canada, Botterell never flew again except on commercial flights.

==Post-war life and honours==
Botterell returned to work at the Bank of Montreal as Assistant Chief Accountant, initially in rural Quebec and then in Montreal, eventually retiring in 1970.

In 1929, he married Maud Goater (died 1983). They had two children, Edward and Frances.

During the Second World War, he was an Air Cadet Squadron Commander, in Lachine (now Montreal).

In 1998, Botterell celebrated his 102nd birthday at a hotel in Lille, where he and 16 other Canadian veterans marked the 80th anniversary of the war&#x27;s end. In 1999, he was guest of honour at a dinner to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 2001, he received a visit from members of the present-day 208 Squadron.

The Canadian War Museum in Ottawa now houses a fence post that was caught in the wing of Botterell&#x27;s Sopwith Camel during a low-level sortie.

During an interview about his wartime exploits Botterell once said: &quot;I had good hands. I didn&#x27;t have the fighting acumen of some, like Billy Bishop. I was just a bank clerk. I wasn&#x27;t one of the very best, but I had my share of action.&quot;

Botterell died in a Toronto nursing home of causes associated with aging. He was 106.

His portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

<doc id="318751" wikidata="Q595012" url="?curid=318751" title="Ephebophilia">
<text>Ephebophilia is the primary sexual interest in mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19. The term was originally used in the late 19th to mid-20th century. It is one of a number of sexual preferences across age groups subsumed under the technical term &quot;chronophilia.&quot; &quot;Ephebophilia&quot; strictly denotes the &quot;preference&quot; for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners, not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction. It is not a psychiatric diagnosis. 

In research environments, specific terms are used for chronophilias: for instance, &quot;ephebophilia&quot; to refer to the sexual preference for mid-to-late adolescents, &quot;hebephilia&quot; to refer to the sexual preference for earlier pubescent individuals, and &quot;pedophilia&quot; to refer to the primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children.

==Etymology and definitions==
The term &quot;ephebophilia&quot; comes from the &quot;ephebos&quot; (from epi &quot;upon&quot; + hebe &quot;youth&quot;, &quot;early manhood&quot;) defined as &quot;a youth of eighteen to twenty, particularly one who underwent his &quot;dokimasia&quot; and was registered as a citizen (Athens)&quot;, and &quot;-philia&quot; . It has been used in publications by Dutch psychologist Frits Bernard in 1950, and reprinted in 1960 in the gay support magazine &quot;Vriendschap&quot; under the pseudonym Victor Servatius, crediting the origin of the term to Magnus Hirschfeld with no exact date given. The word was in fact first published in French (), from Georges Saint-Paul&#x27;s 1896 book, &quot;Tares et Poisons: Perversion et Perversité Sexuelles&quot;.

The term was described by Frenchman Félix Buffière in 1980, and Pakistani scholar Tariq Rahman, who argued that &quot;ephebophilia&quot; should be especially used with regard to homosexuality when describing the aesthetic and erotic interest of adult men in adolescent boys in classical Persian, Turkish, or Urdu literature. The term was additionally revived by Ray Blanchard to denote men who sexually prefer 15- to 19-year-olds. The typical ephebophilic age range has also been given as ages 15–16. Women&#x27;s sexual interest in adolescents has been studied significantly less than men&#x27;s sexual interest in adolescents.

Although ephebophilia is not a psychiatric diagnosis, the term &quot;pedophilia&quot; is commonly used by the general public and the media, at least in the English-speaking world, to refer to any sexual interest by significantly older adults in minors below the local age of consent, regardless of their level of physical or mental development.

==Characteristics==
Mid-to-late adolescents typically have physical characteristics near or identical to that of legal adults. Because of this, scholars Skye Stephens and Michael C. Seto argue that ephebophilia contrasts what a paraphilia entails since &quot;older adolescents are reproductively viable and the fact that typically men are sexually attracted to older adolescents, as reflected in self-report, psychophysiological, and pornography use studies.&quot; Psychiatrist and sexologist Fred Berlin states that most men can find persons in this age group sexually attractive, but that &quot;of course, that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re going to act on it. Some men who become involved with teenagers may not have a particular disorder. Opportunity and other factors may have contributed to their behaving in the way they do&quot;. According to psychologist and sexologist James Cantor, it is &quot;very common for regular men to be attracted to 18-year-olds or 20-year-olds. It&#x27;s not unusual for a typical 16-year-old to be attractive to many men and the younger we go the fewer and fewer men are attracted to that age group.&quot;

&quot;Ephebophilia&quot; is used only to describe the &quot;preference&quot; for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners, not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction. Generally, the preference is not regarded by psychologists as a pathology, as long as it does not interfere with other major areas of one&#x27;s life. It is not included in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition&quot; (DSM-5) or the ICD-10. 

Blanchard &quot;et al.&quot; stated that &quot;hebephilia&quot;, erotic interest which centers on young pubescents, has not come into widespread use, even among professionals who work with sex offenders, and may have been confused with the term &quot;ephebophilia&quot;, which denotes a preference for older adolescents. They reasoned that &quot;few would want to label erotic interest in late—or even mid—adolescents as a psychopathology, so the term hebephilia may have been ignored along with ephebophilia&quot;. Although Stephens and Seto argue that, in contrast to ephebophilia, &quot;conceptually, hebephilia is a paraphilia, reflecting an atypical (statistically rare) sexual age interest in pubescent children&quot;, they also state hebephilia has not been widely accepted as a paraphilia or mental disorder and that there is significant academic debate as to whether it should be classified as either.

<doc id="318752" wikidata="Q585247" url="?curid=318752" title="Alexei Yashin">
<text>Alexei Valeryevich Yashin (; born 5 November 1973) is a Russian former professional ice hockey centre who played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Ottawa Senators and New York Islanders, serving as captain of both teams. He also played nine seasons in the Russian Superleague (RSL) and Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for Dynamo Moscow, CSKA Moscow, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, and SKA Saint Petersburg. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Playing career==

===Ottawa Senators (1993–2001)===
Yashin received his initial fame for being the first draft pick in the history of the expansion Ottawa Senators (second overall in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft). After remaining in Russia for the 1992–93 season with Dynamo Moscow, Yashin arrived in Ottawa for the 1993–94 NHL season, along with Ottawa&#x27;s other highly touted young draft selection, Alexandre Daigle. Yashin soon eclipsed Daigle as the team&#x27;s brightest young star, scoring 79 points in his rookie season and earning a nomination for the Calder Memorial Trophy.

Subsequent seasons saw him emerge as a star player in the NHL, helping Ottawa make the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 1997. In the 1998 playoffs, he scored a key overtime goal against the New Jersey Devils that helped the Senators win their first ever playoff series.

Yashin was eventually named team captain of the Senators, and the pinnacle of his career came in the 1998–99 season when he scored 94 points. At the conclusion of the season, Yashin was runner-up for the Hart Memorial Trophy for the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player, and named an NHL Second Team All-Star. Yashin&#x27;s regular season success did not carry over into the 1999 playoffs, and the Senators were swept in the first round by the Buffalo Sabres.

====Contract disputes====
Off the ice, Yashin&#x27;s time in Ottawa was tumultuous. Senators&#x27; management initially viewed Daigle, who had been selected first overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, as the franchise&#x27;s cornerstone player. While they hesitated in offering Yashin a five-year, $4 million contract, they signed Daigle to one of the largest rookie contracts in history and touted him over Yashin for the Calder Memorial Trophy at the conclusion of the 1993–94 season. Several nasty contract disputes later developed between Yashin and the team, beginning when Yashin refused to honour his contract at the onset of the 1995–96 season, unless the terms were renegotiated to make him the team&#x27;s highest-paid player. Some commentators have sympathized with Yashin&#x27;s position in the initial disputes, as Daigle had struggled to live up to his billing while Yashin&#x27;s offensive numbers exceeded Daigle&#x27;s in every season they played together on the Senators, yet the team inexplicably paid Daigle a higher salary.

In 1998, Yashin initially pledged to give $1 million to the National Arts Centre (NAC) in Ottawa, the Centre&#x27;s largest ever donation. The Senators had earlier collaborated with the NAC to produce the 1998–99 season program titled &quot;Symphony on Ice&quot;, which featured Senators head coach Jacques Martin on the front cover wearing a tuxedo and waving a conductor&#x27;s baton, while NAC music director Pinchas Zukerman was shown in the Senators&#x27; locker room with a #00 Senators jersey. When the NAC learned that one of the conditions of this donation was for them to pay Yashin&#x27;s parents $425,000 in consulting fees for &quot;loosely defined&quot; services, they balked and Yashin cancelled the donation. The failed arrangement was a public relations disaster for Yashin and his family, and served to further damage Yashin&#x27;s already strained relationship with the Ottawa public. 

Yashin&#x27;s relationship with the Senators reached a new low after the 1998–99 season. He refused to honour the final year of his contract and demanded a pay raise (he would have earned $3.6 million that year, compared to other star centremen in the NHL such as Steve Yzerman and Joe Sakic, who each made $6–7 million). When the Senators refused, Yashin demanded a trade on the advice of his agent, Mark Gandler. This was the third time that Yashin demanded a new contract during his five years with the team. The Senators refused to trade Yashin, instead stripping him of his captaincy and issuing it to Daniel Alfredsson. When Yashin still refused to report, the Senators suspended him for the remainder of the 1999–2000 season on 10 November, with the full support of the NHL. Yashin attempted to sign with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) suspended him from playing internationally until the dispute was resolved. After the season, an NHL arbitrator refused to grant Yashin the free agent status he claimed to have earned, instead tolling his contract for another season on the grounds that Yashin owed the Senators the final year of his contract if he ever returned to the NHL. In contrast to earlier contract disputes where many sympathized with his situation, the latest holdout caused many journalists and Senators&#x27; fans to sour on him. 

Yashin returned to the Senators for the 2000–01 season. Despite being jeered by the crowd in every NHL arena, including Ottawa, Yashin had a solid regular season offensively. The Senators won the Northeast Division and made the playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference. They were paired against the seventh-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs. Yashin had a poor series and did not attend the final team meeting, held after the Senators&#x27; early playoff exit.

===New York Islanders (2001–2007)===

On draft day, 2001, Yashin was sent to the New York Islanders in exchange for defenceman Zdeno Chára, forward Bill Muckalt and the second overall draft selection, which the Senators used to draft highly touted centre Jason Spezza. Islanders&#x27; general manager Mike Milbury promptly re-signed Yashin to an enormous ten-year, $87.5 million contract. Although his contract was reduced by 24% due to the new NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) signed in 2005, Yashin was widely considered to be grossly overpaid and virtually untradeable.

After joining the Islanders, Yashin&#x27;s point production declined. While he helped his new team make the playoffs for the first time in eight years in 2001–02, the Islanders were still unable to advance beyond the first round. The Isles lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in a hard-fought seven game series in 2001–02 and then lost in five games to Ottawa in 2002–03 and the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning in 2003–04. Yashin&#x27;s play was generally praised in 2001–02, as he carried the team&#x27;s offence for stretches during the season. The following years, his mediocre point production led people both inside and outside the Islanders organization to question his effort and salary.

Prior to the 2005–06 season, the Islanders lost several key players to free agency or retirement and significantly retooled their roster. Captain Michael Peca was traded to free up room to sign free agents such as high-scoring wing Miroslav Šatan and Yashin became team captain. Journalists suggested that the team had finally been built around Yashin and would sink or swim with his performance. A common defence of Yashin&#x27;s decreased offensive output had been the lack of a legitimate first line winger to play with him. Šatan and Yashin showed signs of chemistry early in the season, but generally produced disappointing results. When Šatan was moved off Yashin&#x27;s line, his offensive output increased markedly. After the season ended with the Islanders out of the playoffs for the first time since his arrival, Yashin acknowledged that he needed to score more. After the season ended, there had been speculation that the Islanders would buy out his contract and rebuild in a different image, but the team decided to retain him.

An October 2006 article in &quot;Newsday&quot; suggested that Yashin must &quot;make a difference&quot; in 2006–07 or he will be bought out at the end of the season. By the 20-game mark, Yashin was earning praise in the local media for the first time in recent memory, and his point totals were among the league leaders. On 25 November 2006, Yashin suffered a knee sprain after taking a knee-to-knee hit. He initially returned after a few weeks, but his effectiveness was reduced, and the team revealed that the knee was not 100%. Early in February, Islanders head coach Ted Nolan decided to rest Yashin until his knee was completely healthy, which prompted questions about whether the team still had faith in Yashin and whether the re-injury was legitimate or a pretext for benching him.

Yashin finally returned to the line-up on 8 March 2007, recording 13 points (five goals and eight assists) in 16 games which helped the Islanders clinch the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round series against the Buffalo Sabres, Yashin registered no points in five games and at times was demoted to the fourth line by head coach Ted Nolan. The Islanders decided to buy-out the remainder of Yashin&#x27;s contract in June 2007, according to a report in &quot;Newsday&quot;. The contract was bought-out for $17.63 million, or two-thirds of the amount left on the contract, to be paid out over eight years at a rate of $2.2 million per year.

===Return to Russia (2007–2012)===
Perhaps surprisingly, Yashin&#x27;s agent, Mark Gandler, claimed that Yashin was keen on a return to Ottawa once his contract had been bought-out by the Islanders. &quot;It&#x27;s a new chapter and we&#x27;ll be calling Ottawa for sure,&quot; Gandler was quoted in the &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot; as saying, adding, &quot;He&#x27;d love to return to Ottawa, in fact.&quot; However, the Senators showed little to no interest in bringing Yashin back into the fold, and Gandler was subsequently &quot;not happy with&quot; contract offers from various NHL teams, resulting in threats of his client returning to Russia to resume his hockey career. On 20 July 2007, Yashin signed a one-year contract with Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Russian Superleague (RSL).

On 29 May 2009, it was announced that Yashin had signed with SKA Saint Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). This news came several months after he helped Lokomotiv Yaroslavl reach the seventh game of the Gagarin Cup final, which they lost 1–0. That season, he also led the team in both regular season as well playoff scoring, with 47 points (21 goals and 26 assists) in 56 regular season games, and 18 points (7 goals and 11 assists) in 19 playoff games.

During the summer of 2011, the New York Islanders and Yashin discussed the possibility of Yashin returning to play for the team in the 2011–12 season. Ultimately, the two sides failed to come to terms and Yashin subsequently signed a one-year deal with CSKA Moscow for the 2011–12 season. Following the 2011–12 season, Yashin retired.

<text>The Lord Chamberlain of the Household is the most senior officer of the Royal Household of the United Kingdom, supervising the departments which support and provide advice to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom while also acting as the main channel of communication between the Sovereign and the House of Lords. The office organises all ceremonial activity such as garden parties, state visits, royal weddings, and the State Opening of Parliament. They also oversee the Royal Mews and royal travel, as well as the ceremony around the awarding of honours.

From 1737 to 1968, the Lord Chamberlain had the power to decide which plays would be granted a licence for performance; this meant that he had the capacity to censor theatre at his pleasure.

The Lord Chamberlain is always sworn of the Privy Council, is usually a peer and before 1782 the post was of Cabinet rank. The position was a political one until 1924. The office dates from the Middle Ages when the King&#x27;s Chamberlain often acted as the King&#x27;s spokesman in Council and Parliament.

The current Lord Chamberlain is Richard Benyon, Baron Benyon, who has been in office since 4 November 2024.

==Historic role==
During the early modern period, the Lord Chamberlain was one of the three principal officers of the Royal Household, the others being the Lord Steward and the Master of the Horse. The Lord Chamberlain was responsible for the &quot;chamber&quot; or the household &quot;above stairs&quot;: that is, the series of rooms used by the Sovereign to receive increasingly select visitors, terminating in the royal bedchamber (although the bedchamber itself came to operate semi-autonomously under the Groom of the Stool/Stole). His department not only furnished the servants and other personnel (such as physicians and bodyguards, the Yeomen of the Guard and Gentlemen Pensioners) in intimate attendance on the Sovereign but arranged and staffed ceremonies and entertainments for the court. He also had (secular) authority over the Chapel Royal. Under the terms of the Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 (22 Geo. 3. c. 82), the Lord Chamberlain took on direct responsibility for items kept and maintained by the Great Wardrobe and the Jewel House (whereby these formerly semi-independent sub-departments were abolished).

As other responsibilities of government were devolved to ministers, the ordering of the Royal Household was largely left to the personal taste of the Sovereign. To ensure that the chamber reflected the royal tastes, the Lord Chamberlain received commands directly from the sovereign to be transmitted to the heads of subordinate departments.

In 1594, the Lord Chamberlain, Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, founded the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, for which William Shakespeare was a part (and later a shareholder in the company) and for whom he wrote most of his plays during his career. Carey served under Elizabeth I at the time and was in charge of all court entertainment, a duty traditionally given to the Master of the Revels, a deputy of the Lord Chamberlain. Later, in 1603, James I, elevated the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men to royal patronage and changed the name to the King&#x27;s Men.

=== Theatre censorship ===
==== The Licensing Act 1737 ====

In 1737, Sir Robert Walpole officially introduced statutory censorship with the Licensing Act 1737 by appointing the Lord Chamberlain to act as the theatrical censor. The Licensing Act 1737 gave the Lord Chamberlain the statutory authority to veto the performance of any new plays: he could prevent any new play, or any modification to an existing play, from being performed for any reason, and theatre owners could be prosecuted for staging a play (or part of a play) that had not received prior approval.

Historically though, the Lord Chamberlain had been exercising a commanding authority on London&#x27;s theatre companies under the royal prerogative for many decades already. But by the 1730s the theatre was not controlled by royal patronage anymore. Instead it had become more of a commercial business. Therefore, the fact the Lord Chamberlain still retained censorship authority for the next 200 years gave him uniquely repressive authority during a period where Britain was experiencing &quot;growing political enfranchisement and liberalization&quot;.

Even further confusion rested in the fact that Members of Parliament could not present changes to the censorship laws because although the Lord Chamberlain exercised his authority under statute law, he was still an official whose authority was derived from the royal prerogative.

==== Theatres Act 1843 ====
By the 1830s, it started to become clear that the theatre licensing system in England needed an upgrade. Playwrights, instead of representatives of minor theatres, actually initiated the final push for reform as they felt that their livelihoods were being negatively affected by the monopoly the larger theatres had on the industry, backed by the laws in the Licensing Act 1737.

A select committee was formed in 1832 with the purpose of examining the laws that affected dramatic literature. Their main complaints were the lack of copyright protection for their work and more importantly that only two patent theatres in London could legitimately perform new plays. After more pressure from playwrights and theatre managers, the findings of the committee were finally presented to Parliament.

It was the proposals of this committee that Parliament implemented in the Theatres Act 1843. The act still confirmed the absolute powers of censorship enjoyed by the Lord Chamberlain but still slightly restricted his powers so that he could only prohibit the performance of plays where he was of the opinion that &quot;it is fitting for the preservation of good manners, decorum or of the public peace so to do&quot;. The Act, however, did abolish the monopoly that the patent houses had in London, providing a minor win for playwrights and theatre managers wishing to produce new work.

==== Theatres Act 1968 ====
In 1909, a Joint Select Committee on Stage Plays (Censorship) was established and recommended that the Lord Chamberlain should continue to act as censor but that it could be lawful to perform plays without a licence from the Lord Chamberlain. However, King Edward VII refused to accept these recommendations. The outbreak of both World Wars put an end to any parliamentary initiatives to change the laws regarding theatre censorship for many years. In 1948, the first British Theatre Conference recommended the termination of theatre censorship with the plan to pursue parliamentary action to ratify this.

In the 1960s the debate to abolish theatre censorship rose again as a new generation of young playwrights came on the scene. They gained popularity with their new plays in local establishments, but since many were refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain, they could not transfer to the West End. In the case of John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;A Patriot for Me&quot;, the Lord Chamberlain at the time, Cameron Cobbold, 1st Baron Cobbold, was irritated that the play was so widely publicized even though he had banned it and therefore pursued legal action. In the end, the play was allowed to continue as it was. At this point, several widely regarded authors had all been censored by the Lord Chamberlain at one time or another, including playwrights Henrik Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw. Sometimes censorship was self-serving. A comedy written for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the early 1960s had, as its plot, a jocular scheme to steal the crown jewels. The Lord Chamberlain issued a one-line letter requiring the excision of that plot element. As Michael Palin, one of its authors and performers notes, that meant banning the entire production. Another joint select committee was founded to further debate on the issue and present a solution. This time the argument largely centered around this issue on the portrayal of living and recently dead individuals, particularly in reference to the monarchy as well as politicians.

After much debate, the Theatres Act 1968 was finally passed; it officially abolished the censorship of the stage and repealed the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s power to refuse a licence to a play of any kind. The first London performance of the musical &quot;Hair&quot; was actually delayed until the act was passed after a licence had been refused.

==== Aftermath ====
The battle regarding the abolition of censorship was largely a political one, fought on principle. Those who opposed the termination of this particular duty of the Lord Chamberlain were mostly concerned about how to protect the reputation of the royal family and the government instead of controlling obscenity and blasphemy on stage. However, this concern has largely been unfounded. Since the termination of censorship, British drama has flourished and produced several prominent playwrights and new works since. The abolition of censorship opened a floodgate of theatrical creativity.

==== The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s plays ====

The long standing role of the Lord Chamberlain as theatrical censor resulted in an extensive archive of both licensed and unlicensed play scripts being preserved. The collection held at the British Library also includes correspondence and administrative documents related to the censorship process.

==Duties of the office==

The Lord Chamberlain is the most senior official of the Royal Household and oversees its business, including liaising with the other senior officers of the Household, chairing Heads of Department meetings, and advising in the appointment of senior Household officials. The Lord Chamberlain also undertakes ceremonial duties and serves as the channel of communication between the Sovereign and the House of Lords. 

Under David Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie, the Lord Chamberlain’s ceremonial and non-executive role was altered to that of chief executive. Airlie initiated changes in the early 1990s under the auspices of &quot;The Way Ahead Group&quot;. Under these plans the Queen agreed to pay tax, greater transparency for the public subsidy of the monarchy began and a greater emphasis on public relations started. In 1986, he produced a 1,393-page report recommending 188 changes for smoother operations of the Royal Household.

The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office is a department of the Royal Household and its day-to-day work is headed by the Comptroller. It is responsible for organizing ceremonial activities including state visits, investitures, garden parties, the State Opening of Parliament, weddings and funerals.

On State and ceremonial occasions, the Lord Chamberlain carries specific symbols that represent his office: a white staff and a key (which is worn at the hip pocket). These insignia are returned to the monarch when the Lord Chamberlain retires from office; but if the monarch dies, the white staff is symbolically broken by the Lord Chamberlain and placed on the coffin of the deceased Sovereign at the end of the State Funeral service. This was last done by Andrew Parker, Baron Parker of Minsmere, who broke his staff over the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.

The Lord Chamberlain is &quot;ex-officio&quot; the Chancellor of the Royal Victorian Order, having possession of a Badge corresponding to that office. As such, they are often appointed to the said Order either upon appointment as Lord Chamberlain, or later in their career. The Lord Chamberlain also regulates the design and the wearing of court uniform and dress and how insignia are worn.

<text>École de technologie supérieure (, &quot;Higher Technology School&quot;, ÉTS), founded in 1974, is a public research university in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and affiliated to the Université du Québec system. The school specializes in applied teaching and research in engineering as well as transferring advanced technologies to companies. 

In any given year, 25% of all engineers receiving a diploma from an engineering school or faculty in the province of Quebec graduate from the ÉTS. The school ranks second in Canada for the number of bachelor&#x27;s degrees in engineering awarded at the undergraduate level. 

== History ==
ÉTS opened in 1974 on Rue Sainte-Catherine, in Montreal, and received 28 undergraduate students in technology (mechanics and electricity). The ÉTS Student Association (AEETS) was created the following year. In 1977, the diploma (B. Tech.) was awarded to the first 14 graduates. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in construction technology and automated production were added later on.

The first student club (Mini-Baja ÉTS) was created in 1989. The same year, ÉTS opened its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees in engineering: construction engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and automated production engineering. In 1990, they were accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (BCAPI). In 1991, the master&#x27;s program (systems technology) was offered. The Center for Technological Entrepreneurship (Centech) was created in 1994. The same year, the students created the Student Grouping Program for International Cooperation (PRÉCI).

In 1998, ÉTS inaugurated the first student residences and several phases were added over the decades. The first doctoral degrees in engineering were awarded in 2000. The first research chair was created in 2001 (in wireless telecommunications). The same year, the Sports Center created the Les Piranhas club. In 2004, the Department of Software Engineering and Information Technology Engineering was opened and a new pavilion was inaugurated (Pavilion B). In 2007, a major expansion of the main pavilion was completed. In 2008, ÉTS adopted a sustainable development policy. Many study programs are added over the years, as well as student clubs.

In 2015, the campus expanded further with the opening of the Student House (Pavilion E). In 2018, the former Dow Planetarium was renovated, and the technology business accelerator Centech moved there. ÉTS adopts an urban development plan for the campus in order to integrate it harmoniously into the neighborhood. The Formula ÉTS student club is moving from the combustion engine to the electric motor starting in 2019. In 2020 a new pavilion was opened (Pavilion D). In 2021, ÉTS achieved carbon neutrality.

<doc id="318772" wikidata="Q694781" url="?curid=318772" title="The American Friend">
<text>The American Friend () is a 1977 neo-noir film written and directed by Wim Wenders, adapted from the 1974 novel &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; by Patricia Highsmith. It stars Dennis Hopper as career-criminal Tom Ripley and Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Zimmermann, a terminally ill picture framer whom Ripley coaxes into becoming an assassin. The film uses an unusual &quot;natural&quot; language concept: Zimmermann speaks German with his family and his doctor, but English with Ripley and while visiting Paris.

==Plot==
Tom Ripley is a wealthy American living in Hamburg, Germany. He is involved in an artwork forgery scheme, in which he drives up auction prices of supposedly newly-found—but really newly-produced—paintings by an artist who has faked his own death. At an auction he is introduced to Jonathan Zimmermann, a picture framer who is dying of leukemia. Zimmermann refuses to shake Ripley&#x27;s hand when introduced, coldly saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard of you,” before walking away.

Raoul Minot, a French criminal, asks Ripley to murder an American gangster. Ripley declines, but, to get even for Zimmermann&#x27;s slight, suggests Minot use Zimmermann for the job. Ripley spreads rumors that Zimmermann&#x27;s illness has suddenly worsened, and Minot offers Zimmermann a great deal of money to kill the gangster. Zimmermann initially turns Minot down, but fearing that he might not have long to live, he joins Minot on a trip to France to get a second medical opinion. Minot has the results falsified to make Zimmermann expect the worst, and Zimmermann agrees to shoot the gangster in a Paris Métro station to provide for his wife Marianne and his son Daniel. Ripley visits Zimmermann in his shop before and after the shooting, ostensibly to get a picture framed. Zimmermann is unaware of Ripley&#x27;s involvement in the murder plot, and the two begin to form a bond, after Zimmermann apologizes for being rude to Ripley when they first met.

Minot visits Ripley to report his satisfaction with Zimmermann&#x27;s performance. Ripley, who has grown to like Zimmermann, is appalled when Minot wants Zimmermann to kill another American gangster in order to trigger a gang war among his rivals. This time, however, he will be on an international express train, using a garrote. This gangster gets the jump on Zimmermann, but Ripley appears out of the shadows and overpowers the man. Zimmermann and Ripley jointly execute the target and his bodyguard and throw the bodies from the train. Back in Hamburg, Ripley confesses to suggesting Zimmermann to Minot. When Zimmermann offers him the money for the second hit, he declines and asks Zimmermann not to divulge his involvement.

Leading a double life causes tension in Zimmermann&#x27;s marriage, as Marianne does not believe his cover stories of traveling and getting paid for experimental treatments. Marianne eventually leaves with Daniel, causing him to collapse. Minot arrives to find out if Zimmermann knows why his flat was recently bombed. When Zimmermann mentions that &quot;we&quot; killed the man on the train, he suspects Ripley has turned on him.

Zimmermann calls Ripley, who takes Zimmermann to his mansion to wait for the assassins that he expects will soon appear. He and Zimmermann ambush and kill the American gangsters that arrive. Minot, who has been captured and beaten by the Americans, escapes in the chaos. Ripley piles the bodies into the ambulance the gangsters brought, but before he and Zimmermann can leave to dispose of them, Marianne arrives and tells Zimmermann that the French medical reports are fake. Ripley says there will be plenty of time to settle everything later, but he and Zimmermann could use her help with their current situation. The trio head to the sea, Ripley in the ambulance, and Marianne driving her exhausted husband in their car. On an isolated beach, Ripley douses the ambulance with gasoline and sets it on fire. Zimmermann gets in the driver&#x27;s seat of his car and speeds away with Marianne, abandoning Ripley. Moments later, he dies at the wheel and the car goes out of control, but Marianne pulls the emergency brake and survives. At the beach, Ripley says to himself, &quot;Oh well. We made it anyway, Jonathan. Be careful.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
Wenders was a fan of Patricia Highsmith and wanted to make a film based on one of her novels, especially &quot;The Cry of the Owl&quot; or &quot;The Tremor of Forgery&quot;. When he learned that the rights to these novels, and Highsmith&#x27;s others, had been sold, he met with the author, and she offered him the unpublished manuscript of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot;, which was published in 1974. Although he did not have the rights to do so, Wenders also incorporated elements from the previous &quot;Ripley&quot; novel, &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;, in the film.

Disliking the title &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot;, Wenders shot the film under the title &quot;Framed&quot;. Another title considered was &quot;Rule Without Exception&quot;. Wenders credits Hopper&#x27;s performance and onscreen relationship with Ganz with inspiring the title &quot;The American Friend&quot;.

Initially, Wenders wanted to cast John Cassavetes as Ripley, but he declined, suggesting Hopper for the part. After casting Hopper, an experienced director, Wenders decided to cast all of the gangster roles with directors, including Gérard Blain, Samuel Fuller, Peter Lilienthal, and Daniel Schmid. Additionally, Nicholas Ray was cast as the artist, and Jean Eustache was cast as a friendly Frenchman.

American popular music is heard or referenced at several points in the film. Ripley quotes the song &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; from &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), a film Hopper directed and starred in, and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; and &quot;I Pity the Poor Immigrant&quot;. Zimmermann plays or sings the songs &quot;Too Much on My Mind&quot; and &quot;Nothin&#x27; in the World Can Stop Me Worryin&#x27; &#x27;Bout That Girl&quot;, both by the Kinks, in his shop; &quot;Summer in the City&quot; (1970), Wenders&#x27;s first full-length feature film, was dedicated to the Kinks. Also, Ripley tells Zimmermann that he is &quot;bringing the Beatles back to Hamburg,&quot; and Zimmermann quotes the band&#x27;s song &quot;Drive My Car&quot; later in the film.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 25 critics&#x27; reviews of the film are positive, with an average score of 7.3/10; the site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus: reads: &quot;&quot;The American Friend&quot; is a slow burning existential thriller that does justice to the Patricia Highsmith source novel.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing: &quot;[Wenders] challenges us to admit that we watch (and read) thrillers as much for atmosphere as for plot. And then he gives us so much atmosphere we&#x27;re almost swimming in it.&quot; David Nusair of &quot;Reel Film Reviews&quot; had a more mixed reaction, calling the film &quot;occasionally thrilling&quot; and praising &quot;Ganz&#x27;s subtle, thoroughly compelling performance&quot;, but criticizing what he called a &quot;disastrous final half hour.&quot;

In &quot;A Girl and a Gun: The Complete Guide to Film Noir&quot;, David N. Meyer says of the film: &quot;Though the plot may not make a whole lot of sense the first time around—and the thick European accents of a couple of the major actors doesn&#x27;t help—&quot;The American Friend&quot; is worth the effort. Few movies from any era or genre offer such rich characters, realistic human relationships, gripping action sequences, or sly humor.&quot; In &quot;Out of the Past: Adventures in Film Noir&quot;, Barry Gifford writes: &quot;Of all the &#x27;homage&#x27; films made since the 1940s and &#x27;50s meant to evoke noir, &quot;The American Friend&quot; succeeds more than most because of the spaces, the sputters, and sudden shifts of energy that allow the characters to achieve veracity.&quot;

Highsmith initially disliked the film, but later changed her mind. Joan Schenkar&#x27;s biography of the author, &quot;The Talented Miss Highsmith: The Secret Life and Serious Art of Patricia Highsmith&quot;, quotes Wenders as saying: &quot;I was really happy with the picture and couldn&#x27;t wait to have Patricia see it. But then, to my great disappointment, she was quite disturbed by it, didn&#x27;t conceal that either and didn&#x27;t have anything good to say about it after the screening. I left utterly frustrated. Months later, I got a letter from her. She said she had seen the film a second time, this time in a public screening on the Champs-Élysées during a visit in Paris. And she had much better feelings about it now. ... And she was full of praise for Dennis Hopper, too, whom she had flat-out rejected the first time. She now wrote that my film had captured the essence of that Ripley character better than any other films. You can guess how relieved I was!&quot; In an interview in 1988, Highsmith praised the film&#x27;s &quot;stylishness&quot; and said the scenes on the train were &quot;terrific.&quot;

The film was entered into the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. It was selected as the West German entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 50th Academy Awards, but was not chosen as one of the five final nominees. The film was also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film by the U.S. National Board of Review.

==Other &quot;Ripley&quot; films==
&quot;The American Friend&quot; is the second big-screen adaptation of one of Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;Ripley&quot; novels, after &quot;Purple Noon&quot; (1960). It was followed by &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; in 1999, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; in 2005. These films (all written and directed by different people) do not form an official series, and none were made with the intention of explicitly preceding or following the others.

<text>The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the largest livestock exhibition and rodeo in the world. It includes one of the richest regular-season professional rodeo events. It has been held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, since 2003, with the exception of 2021 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was previously held in the Astrodome. It is considered to be the city&#x27;s &quot;signature event&quot;, much like New Orleans&#x27;s Mardi Gras, Dallas&#x27;s Texas State Fair, San Diego&#x27;s Comic-Con and New York City&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve at Times Square.

In 2017, attendance reached a record high of 2,611,176 people and 33,000 volunteers. In 2007, the rodeo was deemed &quot;the year of the volunteer.&quot; The event is 20 days long. It is kicked off by the Downtown Rodeo Roundup held near Houston City Hall, the Downtown Rodeo parade, and the ConocoPhillips Rodeo Run – a 10k and 5k walk &amp; run and the World&#x27;s Championship Bar-B-Que Contest. The show features championship rodeo action, livestock competitions, concerts, a carnival, pig racing, barbecue and the Rodeo Uncorked! International Wine Competition, shopping, sales and livestock auctions. Traditional trail rides, which start in different areas of Texas and end in Houston, precede the Rodeo events. The City of Houston celebrates this event with Go Texan Day, where residents are encouraged to dress in western wear the Friday before the rodeo begins.

The rodeo has drawn some of the world&#x27;s biggest recording artists, including Gene Autry, Beyoncé, blink-182, Selena Gomez, Keith Urban, Ariana Grande, Selena, Reba McEntire, Kiss, Kelly Clarkson, Demi Lovato, Charley Pride, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Alan Jackson, REO Speedwagon, Brooks &amp; Dunn, George Strait, Janet Jackson, Garth Brooks, Willie Nelson, Kenny Chesney, Los Tigres del Norte, Bon Jovi, ZZ Top, Chris Stapleton, John Legend, Taylor Swift, Gwen Stefani, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

==History==
===Early years===
In the early part of the 20th century, Houston-area ranchers developed a new breed of cattle, the American Brahman, which was a blend of four breeds of cattle from India. The cattle were well-adapted to the hot, swampy conditions of the Texas Gulf Coast. In the early 1920s, James W. Sartwelle, a manager from Sealy, Texas, founded the American Brahman Breeders Association. Ranchers had no opportunities to show their cattle and raise awareness of the breed. Some attempted to show at the Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in Fort Worth, Texas, but they weren&#x27;t allowed into the main arena.

In January 1932, Sartwelle invited six other businessmen to a lunch at the Texas State Hotel. They decided to host a livestock exposition in Houston. Sartwelle was named the first president of the new Houston Fat Stock Show. Their inaugural event was held in late April 1932 at the Democratic Convention Hall in downtown Houston. It was primarily a regional event, designed to showcase the agriculture and livestock, including Brahmans, in the area around Houston. The show lasted one week and ran a deficit of $2,800. Approximately 2,000 people attended the exposition, where they were also entertained by the Future Farmers Band, comprising 68 high school students from around the state. The Grand Champion Steer was purchased by a local restaurant owner for $504.

The Fat Stock Show was held annually for the next four years. Realizing they had outgrown the space, organizers began looking for a larger venue. Shortly after the 1936 show ended, Sam Houston Hall was torn down. Sam Houston Coliseum, a 10,000-seat arena, would take its place. To allow for construction time, the 1937 exposition was cancelled. The year off allowed Fat Stock show organizers to solidify plans for a larger event. When the show resumed in 1938, it included a parade through downtown Houston, a carnival and midway, and a rodeo with a total purse of $640.50.

In the 1940s, despite World War II, organizers added musical entertainment. Local talent was invited to perform after the rodeo on some evenings. In 1942, singing cowboy Gene Autry became the first nationally recognized entertainer to perform at the show.

Attendance flagged in the early 1950s. To attract more attention to the event, organizers decided to hold a cattle drive. In 1952, the media were invited to join cowboys on a trek from Brenham, Texas to the Fat Stock Show. The publicity stunt was well received. The following year, the Salt Grass Trail Association again held the cattle drive. Other areas of the state organized their own trail rides to the show. This began the transition from a smaller regional event to larger, statewide notice.

Archer Romero, one of the key proponents of the trail ride, took over as president of the Fat Stock Show in 1954. That year, he founded the Go Texan Committee to further publicize the show. The committee would designate a day shortly before the show commenced as Go Texan Day. They encouraged Houston residents to dress in Western wear. The day had the dual purpose of celebrating Texas culture and advertising the show.

In 1957, Myrtis Dightman organized the first trail ride for African-Americans. He led 10 other cowboys in a ride from Prairie View, Texas to Houston. Because of their color, they were not welcomed in Memorial Park, where trail riders typically spent the night. Armed guards were there to ensure that the men could enter safely.

That same year, the show granted its first major scholarship. Ben Dickerson was given $2,000 ($16,000 in 2016) towards his education. This was the first step a major shift in the show&#x27;s purpose. Over the next few decades, the show placed an increasing emphasis on education and scholarships.

===Astrodome era===
Throughout the 1950s, influential local leaders had been advocating that the city acquire a professional sports team. In 1957, the Texas State Legislature granted Harris County the ability to issue bonds to finance a new stadium, so that the city could attract a team. The county put together a commission to formulate a plan. Romero stepped down as Fat Stock Show president to join the commission. They visited stadiums in several large cities, as well as a fairgrounds in Oklahoma. After several years of research, the commission recommended that the county build both a stadium and a connected, air-conditioned coliseum. The presentation to the county commissioners listed four main uses for the new facility: 1) Major league baseball, 2) football, 3) the Fat Stock Show, and 4) various other activities.

County commissioners approved the project, sending it to a vote of Harris County residents. Just before the election, Fat Stock Show organizers announced that the show would donate near South Main for the project, provided the show have input into the design. Voters approved the new stadium, and the Fat Stock Show became one of the focal residents of the new Astrodome. 

The show was renamed the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in 1961. The show had continued to grow, and organizers realized that Sam Houston Coliseum would not be a viable alternative for much longer. The number of exhibitors had declined because many activities were held outside in tents. The chicken, rabbit, and hog shows were cancelled because organizers could not find space for them. Construction began on the Astrohall, next to the Astrodome, in 1965. The following year, the Livestock Show and Rodeo officially moved to the Astrodome. To mark their new location, the organizing committee introduced a new logo, the Bowlegged H. The first night of the rodeo featured entertainment by the stars of the television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Some locals scoffed at the idea that the rodeo and concert could fill a 45,000-seat stadium, but more than 40,000 fans attended the rodeo the night Jimmy Dean performed that year.

Elvis Presley performed at the 1970 show, held in the Astrodome.

Louis Pearce Jr served sixty years as a board member of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. He served on the executive committee as president and CEO, and remained an active executive committee member until his death in 2012. As a result of his dedication and significant contributions to the event, Pearce became known as &quot;Mr. Houston Livestock Show&quot;.

The first Hispanic trail ride commenced in 1973. Calling themselves Los Vaqueros Rio Grande Trail Ride, the group journeyed from the border crossing at Reynosa, Mexico to Houston.

The Go Texan committee launched the World&#x27;s Championship Bar-B-Que Contest in 1974. Seventeen teams entered the competition, which was held in the Astrodome parking lot. Teams were asked to barbecue a minimum of on a wood fire. The inaugural judges included actor Ben Johnson. The competition grew in popularity; by 1981 it had grown to over 200 teams, with 45,000 people visiting.

In 1988, the show added a 5k run and 10k fun run through downtown Houston. Participants would pay an entry fee, with proceeds going to the scholarship fund.

===1990s===
By the 1990s, the show had been expanded to 20 days. Each evening featured a rodeo, sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). The rodeo offered hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money, second only to the National Finals Rodeo. After the rodeo, attendees would see a concert, usually by a famous entertainer. Tickets were relatively inexpensive. For $10 or a little more, a person could buy a ticket to see the livestock shows, wild west shows, the rodeo and concert, and enjoy the carnival. The livestock show was billed as the largest of its kind, with more animals shown by adolescents than anywhere else in the country. Winning livestock were auctioned at the end of the judging, and in the 1990s the combined auction take was usually over $7 million. This was far beyond market value.

The rodeo was generally limited to the top PRCA contestants, based on prize money earned throughout the year. It was popular with cowboys; Houston won the inaugural Indoor Rodeo Committee of the Year award from the PRCA in 1992 and then won each of the next four years as well. The facility had huge screens hanging from the ceiling. Attendees could watch the competition live, then see an instant replay on the screens.

In 1996, the rodeo was halted one evening. The crew on the space shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; appeared live on the big screens to address the crowd. Later that year, country singer George Strait set a record, having played to more than 1 million Houston rodeo attendees. The 1996 rodeo earned a net profit of $16.8 million and gave more than $7.9 million away in scholarships, assistantships, and research grants.

The Hideout was created in 1997 to give attendees more entertainment options after the rodeo and concert had ended. It is a nightclub for adults over 21 to dance and drink.

===21st century===
A new venue, Reliant Stadium (now NRG Stadium), was built on the Astrodome grounds in 2002. The rodeo marked its last night in the Astrodome on March 3, 2002, with a performance by country legend George Strait. The show was recorded and became Strait&#x27;s first official live album, &quot;For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome&quot;. Following the show, the Astrohall was torn down. A new exhibition space, Reliant Center, was constructed on the grounds, expanding exhibition capacity to 1.4 million square feet. Rodeo executives moved their offices into the second floor of the center. When the rodeo opened in 2003 in its new homes, Strait performed on opening night. In the first two seasons at Reliant, the Hideout was cancelled, but it resumed in 2005, now located within the Astrodome.

In 2004, show organizers added a new event, Rodeo Uncorked! International. Vintners from around the world entered their wines into a competition. These were then auctioned, raising $313,700. The following year, the wine auction raised more than $500,000. To give livestock show attendees the opportunity to taste the wines, the show launched the Wine Garden in 2008.

Attendance at the rodeo began falling. Attendees would purchase a ticket and arrive just before the concert, leaving a largely empty stadium for the rodeo itself. Joe Bruce Hancock, then the general manager of the rodeo, theorized that the audience was more urban and less familiar with rodeo events. The current show structure moved slowly and made it difficult for this type of audience to follow what was happening. As one of the PRCA-sanctioned rodeos, show organizers had little ability to make changes. The PRCA required that certain events be held, dictated the general structure of the rodeo, and insisted that each organizing committee use the PRCA national registration system. This meant that rodeos did not know which contestants were going to be appearing, or on which days.

The Houston rodeo committee requested a waiver from the PRCA in 2008. Houston would still remit 6% of the rodeo purse to the PRCA, but they would change the format and the registration system. Now, the rodeo knew who would be competing on which days and could market those individual appearances. The rodeo was restructured into a playoff format. Attendance at the rodeo skyrocketed. Champion bareback rider Bobby Mote said competitors appreciated the changes: &quot;It was exciting to be a part of because people were really getting into it. Finally, we were performing for a real crowd in Houston.&quot; The finale of the 2008 rodeo was the PRCA&#x27;s Xtreme Bulls tour. The same year, HLSR was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame along with 15 other PRCA rodeos that had previously been granted special recognition.

During the 2009 state legislative session, local state senator Mario Gallegos filed a bill that would require the livestock show organizing committee to comply with the state open records rules. The bill would also encourage the rodeo to contract with more minority-owned business and to add minorities to the livestock show&#x27;s executive committee. At the time, the 19-member executive committee composed entirely of men, without a single Hispanic or African-American representative. Livestock show President Leroy Shafer insisted that the legislation was unprecedented, and that non-profits should not be held to the same standards as public entities. Shafer maintained that the executive committee membership was determined in large part by length of volunteer service, with the members having served, on average, for 37.5 years. According to Shafer, in time minorities and women would accumulate the years of service required to be on the committee. Minority leaders in Houston advocated a boycott. The controversy caused new Harris County sheriff Adrian Garcia to decline an invitation to be co-grand marshal of the rodeo parade, although Garcia still marched in the parade as part of the sheriff&#x27;s office mounted patrol.

When the Astrodome was permanently closed in 2009, the Hideout moved to a giant tent on the grounds of the facility.

The rodeo&#x27;s waiver from the PRCA expired in 2011. Houston applied for a renewal but were denied. The PRCA was under new management, who insisted that all of their rodeos should abide by the same rules. The show ended its contract with the organization, making the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo an independent rodeo. As an unsanctioned rodeo, none of the prize money would count towards competitors&#x27; world standings, and thus qualification for the National Finals Rodeo. Some competitors were upset with the change, as winning the RodeoHouston $50,000 prize had generally been enough to qualify a cowboy for the National Finals Rodeo. However, because the $1.75 million purse was the largest one in rodeo at that time, there was little difficulty in attracting cowboys. Because they were now independent, the show could now invite specific competitors who might not otherwise have qualified to appear, such as local cowboy, 8-time world champion calf roper Fred Whitfield. Of the 280 competitors invited to attend in 2012, all but one accepted.

In an additional change, the rodeo dropped the PRCA&#x27;s Xtreme Bulls tour from its last evening. As a replacement, they offered the Cinch RodeoHouston Super Shootout, inviting the champions from the top 10 rodeos in North America to compete in bull riding, saddle-bronc and bareback riding, and barrel racing. Two of the rodeos represented, the Calgary Stampede and the Ponoka Stampede, were also non-PRCA sanctioned invitational rodeos. Total attendance in 2011 topped 2.26 million, an increase of almost 119,000 people over 2010.

In 2019 &amp; 2020 and resuming in 2022, RodeoHouston has been sanctioned by the PRCA again. The Super Series is PRCA-sanctioned and money won here by contestants counts toward the world standings for the National Finals Rodeo. However, the Super Shootout was unsanctioned and money won here did not count toward the PRCA world standings. Also in 2019, RodeoHouston won the PRCA Large Indoor Rodeo of the Year Award.

On March 11, 2020 after running for 8 of 20 planned days, the rodeo was shut down by the city of Houston after evidence emerged of community spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Montgomery County constable deputy in his 40s who tested positive for COVID-19 had attended a barbeque cookoff at the rodeo. The man was hospitalized and at least 18 rodeo attendees tested positive for coronavirus, though it is unclear whether they all contracted it at the event. It was the only time in the event&#x27;s history the rodeo got shut down.

The 2021 edition of the rodeo was originally rescheduled to May due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but after several weeks, it was cancelled altogether, making it the event&#x27;s first cancellation in 84 years, with the 89th edition instead being deferred to 2022.

In the 2022 spring season, the Houston rodeo was officially reopened to the public, celebrating its second-highest attended record since 2017, with over 2.4 million reported guests in attendance. An official 2023 season was announced.

It was announced that as of 2023, the Super Shootout would no longer be a part of the rodeo.

==Events==
===Rodeo Uncorked! RoundUp and Best Bites Competition===
Almost 3,000 bottles of wine are submitted each year for judging in the Rodeo International Wine Competition. High scoring wines are served to the public at the Rodeo Uncorked! RoundUp and Best Bites Competition before the HLSR begins. More than 5,000 people purchase tickets to attend the event. There, they can sample food from more than 100 local restaurants and vote on their pick for tastiest food.

During the livestock show, attendees can purchase glasses of these wine entries at the Wine Garden, an outdoor area comprising six tents that shelter 30,000 square feet of space. Live music is offered in the Wine Garden area each evening.

===Go Texan Day===
The unofficial kickoff of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is Go Texan Day. Traditionally held the Friday before the rodeo begins, the day is meant to encourage the Houston community to celebrate Western culture. Houston-area residents are encouraged to wear Western attire, such as jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. The day is an unofficial holiday, and local school districts and many businesses encourage their students and employees to participate. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, journalist Manny Fernandez described Go Texan Day as &quot;&quot;the one day of the year on which people in Houston dress the way people outside Houston think people in Houston dress&quot;.

===Trail rides===
From 1952 to 2020 &amp; since 2022, traditional trail rides have been a part of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. As of 2017, there were 13 official trail rides, totaling over 3,000 riders. The trail rides range in size from a dozen to over one thousand people who ride on horseback or in horse-drawn wagons from various areas of the state to Houston. They make their way at about per hour, covering up to each day. Many of the routes take place in part along major highways and busy city streets, making safety a major concern.

The trail rides last from a few days to three weeks, depending on the distance they cover. Some of the participants are able to join only on weekends or at the end of the trip. The days start very early, and often end with live music or a small celebration. Many riders choose to camp in recreational vehicles rather than in the open. Each morning, they drive their vehicles and horse trailers to the next camping spot, then have a bus or convoy take them back so they can retrace their path on horseback. Participants can bring their own provisions, or, in some cases, purchase meals at a chuck wagon that is also following the trail.

The rides converge at Memorial Park in Houston on Go Texan Day, the Friday before the livestock show and rodeo begins. The city closes some roads downtown to allow the riders to reach their destination safely. The resulting traffic interruption cause annual complaints from those who work downtown. The following day, all of the trail riders participate in the parade.
===Rodeo Parade and Rodeo Run===
The official kickoff of the show is the annual Rodeo Parade. It is held the Saturday before the show begins and runs through downtown Houston. The parade features members of the 13 trail rides, influential Houstonians, bands, and floats.

Preceding the parade is the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Run. More than 10,000 people compete annually in 5k and 10k fun runs. All proceeds go to the show&#x27;s scholarship fund. The run generally begins near Bagby Street and ends at Eleanor Tinsley Park.

When the Rodeo was cancelled in 2021, the fun runs went virtual.

===World&#x27;s Championship Bar-B-Que Contest===
The Thursday, Friday, and Saturday before the livestock show begins, the World&#x27;s Championship Bar-B-Que Contest, established in 1974, is held on the grounds of NRG Park. It is one of the largest barbecue cookoffs in the United States, but it is not sanctioned by the Kansas City Barbecue Society. More than 250 teams, including a handful from outside of the United States, compete to be named best entry in several categories, including brisket, chicken, and ribs. The barbecue must be cooked on a wood fire; electric or gas fires are prohibited.

Entries are judged on a 50-point scale, with the most points gained for taste and tenderness, and lesser amounts available for smell and the look and feel of the entry. Winners are named in each category, and then an overall Grand Champion is named. Teams can also compete for non-food-related awards, such as cleanest area, most unique pit, and most colorful team.

Each barbecue team has their own tent on the grounds. Many offer their own entertainment, generally cover bands or djs. Entrance into each tents is by invitation only. Many teams sell sponsorships that provide access to their tent, with the money often going to charity. Attendees without an invitation to a specific tent can congregate in one of the three general admission areas, each with its own live entertainment. A record 264,132 people attended the World&#x27;s Championship Barbecue Contest in 2013.

The 51st is scheduled for 28 February–2 March 2025.

===Rodeo and concert===

One of the largest draws for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the 20 consecutive evenings of rodeo and concert, held in NRG Stadium. Tickets are relatively inexpensive, averaging about $29 in 2016, and also grant admission to the livestock show and fairgrounds. More than 43,000 season tickets are sold every year, with the remaining seats 30,000 seats available for individual-show sale. Members of the HLSR are given an opportunity to buy individual tickets before the general public.

RodeoHouston is sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). It offers one of the largest prize purses in North America, over $2 million, which count for the PRCA&#x27;s National Finals Rodeo. RodeoHouston features 280 of the top professional cowboys. They compete in a playoff format, with the ultimate champion in each event earning $50,000. For one day, contestants compete in the RodeoHouston SuperShootout. Champions from each of the top 10 rodeos in North America are invited to compete as teams in a subset of rodeo events. In 2020 &amp; since 2022, the entire rodeo has been televised live on The Cowboy Channel.

After the professional rodeo concludes, children are given an opportunity to compete. Each evening, 30 high school students from across the state compete in the calf scramble. They are given the opportunity to chase down (on foot) and catch one of 15 calves, put a halter on them, and drag them back to the center of the stadium. Winners are given money to purchase their own heifer or steer to show the following year. Immediately following the calf scramble is mutton busting. Five- and six-year-olds wearing protective gear try to ride a sheep across a portion of the arena. On the last night of the rodeo, the winners from each of the previous evenings compete again to see who will become grand champion.

A rotating stage is then brought into the arena for the nightly concert. The majority of evenings are performances by country music singers, although several nights are dedicated to pop or rock music. The annual Go Tejano Day generally draws the largest crowds. The winner of the annual Mariachi Invitational competition is invited to perform onstage with the Tejano acts.

===Grounds===
Visitors who are not attending the rodeo and concert can purchase a lower-cost general admission ticket to gain access to all of NRG Park except the stadium.

According to livestock show CEO Joel Cowley, &quot;if we can draw people here for a concert or a carnival or a rodeo and teach them something about agriculture, it’s a win in regard to our mission.&quot; NRG Center contains AgVenture, which provides educational displays about agriculture and the origins of the food for sale at grocery stores. More than 61,000 school children visited AgVenture in 2015 on official tours. Displays include an area where attendees can see cows, pigs, and sheep give birth or see chickens hatch. There are also displays with live rabbits and honeybees. NRG Center also hosts a large vendor area.

The grounds feature an area where children can do pretend farm chores and compete in races using pedal-driven tractors. There is also a petting zoo, pony and camel rides, and a full carnival and midway. 

Other competitions are held throughout the three weeks at NRG Center and NRG Arena. These include open cattle shows and a paint horse competition. Children with mental and physical disabilities are invited to compete in the Lil&#x27; Rustlers Rodeo, which offers imitation rodeo events, such as riding a stick horse.

Free educational seminars are available throughout the three weeks of the livestock show. They are open to the public and cover topic related to wildlife, agricultural in general, and farming and hunting.

Adults can visit The Hideout, a temporary dance hall located in a large tent near NRG Arena. After the show in NRG Stadium concludes, The Hideout features live music from new artists. Several past performers at The Hideout, including the Dixie Chicks, Blake Shelton, Keith Urban, and the Eli Young Band, later became headliners at the main rodeo show. Approximately 2,000-3,000 people visit The Hideout each evening.

===Livestock show===
HLSR is the largest indoor livestock show in the world. For a full week, cattle auctions are held in NRG Arena for professional breeders to sell their stock. The livestock show has a larger international presence than any other. In 2017, the Ministers of Agriculture from Russia and Colombia made official visits to HLSR, joining more than 2,600 other international businessmen representing 88 countries. The HLSR International Committee estimated that they facilitated more than $2.6 million in agriculture sales between livestock show participants and international visitors in 2016.

Junior market auctions are also held. Children from around the state show the livestock that they have raised, including cattle, market barrow, market goats, market lambs, market broilers, market turkeys, and rabbits. The livestock are judged, with the winners auctioned off. It is the largest set of animals to be shown and judged of any livestock show. Most champion animals sell for well over market value. Winning children are guaranteed a certain amount of scholarship money; if the bid is larger than that amount, the excess funds are directed to the general scholarship fund. The 2024 Livestock and Horse Show competitions drew 37,510 entries, with junior auction sales totaling $26,198,052. 

==Impact==
HLSR is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization and ranks as the 7th-largest Better Business Bureau accredited charity in Houston. Its primary source of revenue is an annual livestock show and rodeo and the events leading up to it. HLSR has 85 full-time employees and over 35,000 volunteers, divided into 109 committees. Volunteers provide over 2.1 million hours (about 239 and a half years) of service, representing a total of $51 million dollars. All of them are required to pay a minimum fee of $50, and some committees require a larger donation. The most popular committees have a wait list.

In 2024, the total attendance for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo was 2.5 million people, with the overall total attendance record being over 2.6 million in 2017. It is the largest cultural event in Houston, and its attendance numbers dwarf those of annual attendance for most professional sports teams and most major cultural events in other cities. In comparison, New Orleans&#x27; Mardi Gras generally draws about 1.4 million visitors.

In 2024, the organization reported operating revenue of $223,676,691. The Corral Club, which covers the sale of much of the alcohol on the grounds, but not that within the stadium, sold more alcohol in the three weeks of the HLSR than any other mixed-beverage permit holder in the state for the month of March 2016, and in the year prior was only outsold by the stadium where the Dallas Cowboys play.

A 2010 economic impact analysis estimate that the HLSR funneled $220 million into the Houston economy, with almost half of that coming from visitors outside of the Houston metro region. HLSR and its suppliers and vendors paid over $27 million in taxes to local entities. The study&#x27;s author estimates that by 2017, the HLSR would be contributing almost $500 million to the local economy each year, the equivalent of hosting the Super Bowl every year.

HLSR awarded $26.07 million in scholarships, grants, and graduate assistantships in 2017. More than 750 students received scholarships, many of them worth $20,000 over four years. Recipients can pursue any field of study but are required to attend a university or college in Texas. Eleven different colleges were awarded funds to pay for graduate assistants. The remainder of the money was allocated for grants to other nonprofits or educational facilities to provide programs to help educate youth about agriculture or pioneer heritage. Since 1932, HLSR boasts that it has given away over $430 million.

<text>A science fair or engineering fair is an event hosted by a school that offers students the opportunity to experience the practices of science and engineering for themselves. In the United States, the Next Generation Science Standards makes experiencing the practices of science and engineering one of the three pillars of science education. Students perform some sort of research and then present their experiment in a poster session or other display format.

==History==
Science fairs began in the United States in New York City in the 1930s under the auspices of a civic organization called the American Institute of the City of New York with the effort led in New York City by Morris Meister who later founded the Bronx High School of Science. Meister believed in the educational ideas of John Dewey that focused on doing rather than just learning what already had been done. The goals of the after-school science club federation were twofold: &quot;to aid in the development of the scientific leaders of the next generation and at the same time foster a better understanding of science among its laymen&quot;.

Initially, science fairs were mostly exhibits and demonstration projects or mere displays of projects. This changed after the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Increasingly, science and engineering fairs became viewed by many as a way to encourage and help students find their way into science and engineering career paths. Popularity of science fairs in the United States increased in the 1950s along with interest in the sciences after the world witnessed the use of the first two atomic weapons and the dawn of television. As the decade progressed, science stories in the news, such as Jonas Salk&#x27;s vaccine for polio and the launch of Sputnik, brought science fiction to reality and attracted increasing numbers of students at every level to fairs.

==Goals==
Science and engineering fairs attract students at every level—elementary, middle and high school—to compete in science and technology activities. Science fairs also can allow for students with intense interest in the sciences to be paired with mentors from nearby colleges and universities, so that the students have access to instruction and equipment that the local schools do not provide. This mentoring, along with coaching students for their science fair interviews, has been shown to be very important for student success.

==International events==
Most countries have regional science fairs in which interested students can freely participate. Winners of these regional fairs send students to national fairs such as the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) and Canada-Wide Science Fair (CWSF). National science fairs typically send winners to international fairs such as ISEF (which is a national and an international science fair) and EUCYS. Currently, the biotechnology company-sponsored Regeneron Science Talent Search offers a grand prize of a $250,000 scholarship. The 2018 documentary &quot;Science Fair&quot; chronicles the competition.
