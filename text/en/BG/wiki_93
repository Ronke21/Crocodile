<text>The trains were the first generation Shinkansen trainsets built to run on Japan&#x27;s Tōkaidō Shinkansen high-speed line which opened in 1964. The last remaining trainsets were withdrawn in 2008 after 44 years of service.

==History==
The 0 series trains (which were not originally classified, as there was no need to distinguish classes of trainset until later) entered service with the start of Tōkaidō Shinkansen operations in October 1964. These units were white with a blue stripe along the windows and another at the bottom of the car body, including the front pilot.

Unlike previous Japanese trains on the national network, the Tōkaidō Shinkansen and all subsequent Shinkansen lines are between the rails. The trains were powered by 25 kV AC electricity at 60 Hz with all axles of all cars powered by traction motors, giving a operation top speed.

The original trains were introduced as 12-car sets, with some sets later lengthened to 16 cars. Later, shorter trains of six cars and even four cars were assembled for lesser duties. Production of 0 series units continued from 1963 until 1986.

Shinkansen sets are generally retired after fifteen to twenty years. The final remaining 0 series sets were six-car sets used on JR-West &quot;Kodama&quot; services on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen between and , and on the Hakata-Minami Line until their retirement on 30 November 2008.

Following retirement from regular service, JR-West ran a number of special commemorative &quot;Hikari&quot; runs in December 2008. &quot;Hikari&quot; 347, powered by set R61, arrived at Hakata Station at 6:01 pm on 14 December 2008, bringing to an end the 44 years of service of the 0 series trains.

==Set formations==

===Original 12-car H/K/N/R/S sets===

The initial shinkansen fleet delivered for use on &quot;Hikari&quot; and &quot;Kodama&quot; services on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen from 1 October 1964 consisted of 30 12-car sets formed of 1st- and 2nd-batch cars. Six sets, H1 to H6, were built by Hitachi between April and August 1964, six sets, K1 to K6, were built by Kisha between July and September 1964, six sets, N1 to N6, were built by Nippon Sharyo between March and September 1964, six sets, R1 to R6, were built by Kawasaki Sharyo between July and September 1964, and six sets, S1 to S6, were built by Kinki Sharyo between April and August 1964. These sets were allocated to Tokyo and Osaka depots.

A further 10 12-car sets (H7/8, K7/8, N7/8, R7/8, S7/8) were delivered between April and July 1965, formed of 120 3rd-batch cars, five 4th-batch sets were delivered between June and July 1966, and five 5th-batch sets were delivered between October and November 1966.

The original 12-car sets were formed as follows, with two first-class cars (type 15 and 16) and two buffet cars (type 35).

===12-car H/K/N/R/S/T &quot;Kodama&quot; sets===
A further 21 6th- to 9th-batch 12-car sets were delivered between 1967 and 1969 with only one first-class car (type 16) for use on &quot;Kodama&quot; services. The &quot;T&quot; sets were built by Tokyu Car Corporation.

These sets were formed as follows.

===16-car H/K/N/R/S &quot;Hikari&quot; sets===
The original 30 12-car sets were lengthened to 16 cars between December 1969 and February 1970 with the inclusion of new 10th-batch cars for &quot;Hikari&quot; services to handle the increased number of passengers travelling to and from Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka in 1970. From the opening of the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen in 1972, these sets were renumbered H1 to H30.

===16-car K &quot;Kodama&quot; sets===
Between 1972 and 1973, the earlier 12-car &quot;Kodama&quot; sets were lengthened to 16 cars with the inclusion of new 13th- and 15th-batch cars, and were renumbered K1 to K47.

===16-car H &quot;Hikari&quot; restaurant car sets===
With the opening of the Sanyo Shinkansen extension to Hakata, the fleet of 16-car H &quot;Hikari&quot; sets was reformed and increased between 1973 and 1974 with the inclusion of new 16th- and 17th-batch cars, including new restaurant cars (type 36) in addition to the buffet car (type 35). The fleet as of 10 March 1975 consisted of 64 sets, numbered H1 to H64.

===16-car NH &quot;Hikari&quot; sets===

Between 1977 and 1980, 35 new 16-car NH sets were formed of −1000 subseries cars (batches 22 to 29) for &quot;Hikari&quot; services on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen and San&#x27;yō Shinkansen lines. The introduction of 100 series and later 300 series trains reduced the number of 0 series trains used on &quot;Hikari&quot; services, with 0 series &quot;Hikari&quot; services operated by JR Central ending in 1995. A small fleet was subsequently maintained by JR-West for use on additional holiday period &quot;Hikari&quot; services, with the last remaining unit, NH32, being disbanded in December 1999.

The NH sets had two Green (first class) cars and a restaurant car in addition to a buffet car, although use of the restaurant cars was discontinued from the mid-1990s.



===16-car YK sets===

The 16-car YK sets were operated by JR Central on the all-stations &quot;Kodama&quot; services. These sets had upgraded reserved seat cars with 2+2 seating employing 100 series style seats, but only one Green car per 16-car set. Standard seating was 3+2 in standard class, and 2+2 in Green cars.

The fleet was operated by JR Central on the Tokaido Shinkansen until the last units were withdrawn on 18 September 1999. In the last two months of service, they ran with &quot;Arigatō 0 Series&quot; stickers on the front ends.

===12-car SK sets===
These 12-car SK sets based at Hakata Depot were operated by JR-West on Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;West Hikari&quot; services between Shin-Osaka and Hakata. Sets were formed of upgraded 5000 and 7000 subseries vehicles with improved seating, and buffet cars were refurbished with a special seating area. All standard class cars had upgraded 2+2 seating. The sets were recognizable externally by the addition of an extra thin blue line below the windows (similar to 100 series) and by the large &quot;West&quot; decals near the doors. Some sets originally included specially converted cinema cars, but these were withdrawn in 1996. Following the end of the &quot;West Hikari&quot; services on 21 April 2000, the remaining SK units were reformed into new 6-car R60 sets to replace unrefurbished sets on Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; services.

===4-car Q sets===

4-car Q sets were formed from March 1997 for use on &quot;Kodama&quot; shuttle services running between Hakata and /, and also for use on some Hakata-Minami Line duties. These sets had no Green car and are not newly built. Instead they are reformed from original sets. Due to them being life-expired quickly, 100 series 4-car P sets replaced them from 2000 onwards. The last remaining unit was withdrawn in September 2001. Set Q3 remained as a static training set at Shin-Shimonoseki Station until 2009, when it was replaced by 100 Series set P2.

===6-car R sets===
The 6-car R units with no Green car were first formed in June 1985, and were used on JR-West &quot;Kodama&quot; services between Shin-Osaka and Hakata. They were also used to operate services on the short Hakata-Minami Line from Hakata Station.

The no. 3 cars of sets R2 and R24 were rebuilt as &quot;Children&#x27;s Saloons&quot; with the former buffet counter area converted into a children&#x27;s soft play area. These sets ran branded as &quot;Family Hikari&quot; during holiday periods. From March 1997 a refurbishment programme was commenced on the R sets, with new internal trim, rotating seats and new toilets/washing facilities. The refurbished units were recognisable externally by an extra thin blue line below the windows (as with &quot;West Hikari&quot; SK sets), and new &quot;W&quot; decals near the doors.

From April 2000, 6-car &quot;WR&quot; sets were created from former SK unit cars and renumbered in the R60 series. These retained the larger buffet area (disused) and 2+2 seating of the former &quot;West Hikari&quot; trains, and gradually replaced the remaining unrefurbished R sets. These units initially retained their &quot;West Hikari&quot; branding, but were gradually repainted into the new JR-West &quot;Kodama&quot; livery from May 2002. Initially scheduled to be withdrawn in 2006, the last three remaining sets (R61/R67/R68) remained in service until 30 November 2008. By June 2008 they had been repainted into their original ivory and blue livery with silver roofs.

==Preserved examples==
There are 25 preserved units of the 0 Series Shinkansen:
* 23 former vehicles are preserved or stored in museums and various other locations around Japan
* The leading vehicle from car 4 of set Q2 is preserved at the National Railway Museum in York, England. It was donated to the museum by JR-West in 2001 
* The leading vehicle from car 4 of set R1 is preserved at Tainan HSR station in Tainan, Taiwan. It was formerly used as a structure gauging car from 2004, during construction of the Taiwan High Speed Rail, and was formally donated to Taiwan in 2012. Restoration work was completed from 2018 to 2019, before the car was put on display on December 22, 2023.

<text>The Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), also known as the northern sparrowhawk or simply the sparrowhawk, is a small bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. Adult male Eurasian sparrowhawks have bluish grey upperparts and orange-barred underparts; females and juveniles are brown above with brown barring below. The female is up to 25% larger than the male – one of the greatest size differences between the sexes in any bird species. Though it is a predator which specialises in catching woodland birds, the Eurasian sparrowhawk can be found in any habitat and often hunts garden birds in towns and cities. Males tend to take smaller birds, including tits, finches and sparrows; females catch primarily thrushes and starlings but are capable of killing birds weighing or more.

The Eurasian sparrowhawk is found throughout the temperate and subtropical parts of the Old World; whilst birds from the northern parts of the range migrate south for winter, their southern counterparts remain resident or make dispersive movements. Eurasian sparrowhawks breed in suitable woodland of any type, with the nest, measuring up to across, built using twigs in a tree. Four or five pale blue, brown-spotted eggs are laid; the success of the breeding attempt is dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male brings her food. The chicks hatch after 33 days and fledge after 24 to 28 days.

The probability of a juvenile surviving its first year is 34%, with 69% of adults surviving from one year to the next. Mortality in young males is greater than that of young females and the typical lifespan is four years. This species is now one of the most common birds of prey in Europe, although the population crashed after the Second World War. Organochlorine insecticides used to treat seeds before sowing built up in the bird population, and the concentrations in Eurasian sparrowhawks were enough to kill some outright and incapacitate others; affected birds laid eggs with fragile shells, which broke during incubation. However its population recovered after the chemicals were banned, and it is now relatively common, classified as being of least concern by BirdLife International.

The Eurasian sparrowhawk&#x27;s hunting behaviour has brought it into conflict with humans for hundreds of years, particularly racing pigeon owners and people rearing poultry and gamebirds. It has also been blamed for decreases in passerine populations. Studies of racing- pigeon deaths found that Eurasian sparrowhawks were responsible for less than 1%. Falconers have utilised the Eurasian sparrowhawk since at least the 16th century; although the species has a reputation for being difficult to train, it is also praised for its courage. The species features in Teutonic mythology and is mentioned in works by writers including William Shakespeare, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Ted Hughes.

== Taxonomy ==
Within the family Accipitridae, the Eurasian sparrowhawk is a member of the large genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;, which consists of small to medium-sized woodland hawks. Most of the Old World members of the genus are called sparrowhawks or goshawks. The species&#x27; name dates back to the Middle English word &quot;sperhauk&quot; and Old English &quot;spearhafoc&quot;, a hawk which hunts sparrows. The Old Norse name for the Eurasian sparrowhawk, &quot;sparrhaukr&quot;, was thought to have been coined by Vikings who encountered falconry in England. English folk names for the Eurasian sparrowhawk include &quot;blue hawk&quot;, referring to the adult male&#x27;s colouration, as well as &quot;hedge hawk&quot;, &quot;spar hawk&quot;, &quot;spur hawk&quot; and &quot;stone falcon&quot;.

The Eurasian sparrowhawk was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 landmark 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Falco nisus&quot;, but moved to its present genus by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The current scientific name is derived from the Latin &quot;accipiter&quot;, meaning &#x27;hawk&#x27;, and &quot;nisus&quot;, the sparrowhawk. According to Greek mythology Nisus, the king of Megara, was turned into a sparrowhawk after his daughter, Scylla, cut off his purple lock of hair to present to her lover (and Nisus&#x27; enemy), Minos.

The Eurasian sparrowhawk forms a superspecies with the rufous-chested sparrowhawk of eastern and southern Africa, and possibly the Madagascar sparrowhawk. Geographic variation is clinal, with birds becoming larger and paler in the eastern part of the range compared to the western part. Within the species itself, six subspecies are generally recognised:
* &quot;A. n. nisus&quot;, the nominate subspecies, was described by Linnaeus in 1758. It breeds from Europe and West Asia to western Siberia and Iran; northern populations winter south to the Mediterranean, Northeast Africa, Arabia and Pakistan.
* &quot;A. n. nisosimilis&quot; was described by Samuel Tickell in 1833. It breeds from central and eastern Siberia east to Kamchatka and Japan, and south to northern China. This subspecies is wholly migratory, wintering from Pakistan and India eastwards through Southeast Asia and southern China to Korea and Japan; some even reach Africa. It is very similar to, but slightly larger than, the nominate subspecies.
* &quot;A. n. melaschistos&quot; was described by Allan Octavian Hume in 1869. It breeds in mountains from Afghanistan through the Himalayas and southern Tibet to western China, and winters in the plains of South Asia. Larger and longer-tailed than &quot;nisosimilis&quot;, it has dark slate-coloured upperparts, and more distinct rufous barring on the underparts.
* &quot;A. n. wolterstorffi&quot;, described by Otto Kleinschmidt in 1900, is resident in Sardinia and Corsica. It is the smallest of all the subspecies, darker on the upperparts and more barred below than the nominate subspecies.
* &quot;A. n. granti&quot;, described by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1890, is confined to Madeira and the Canary Islands. It is small and dark.
* &quot;A. n. punicus&quot;, described by Erlanger in 1897, is resident in Northwest Africa north of the Sahara. It is very similar to &quot;nisus&quot;, being large and pale.

== Description ==
The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey with short, broad wings and a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. Marked size difference in this direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt other birds.

The adult male is long, with a wingspan of and a mass of . He has slate-grey upperparts (sometimes tending to bluish), with finely red-barred underparts, which can look plain orange from a distance; his irides are orange-yellow or orange-red. The female is much larger at long, with a wingspan of , and a mass of . She has dark brown or greyish-brown upperparts, brown-barred underparts and bright yellow to orange irides. The juvenile is warm brown above, with rusty fringes to the upperparts, and coarsely barred or spotted brown below, with pale yellow eyes; its throat has dark streaks and lacks a mesial (midline) stripe.

The Eurasian sparrowhawk&#x27;s pale underparts and darker upperparts are an example of countershading, which helps to break up the bird&#x27;s outline. Countershading is exhibited by birds of prey that hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds and the adult male&#x27;s bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other &quot;Accipiters&quot;.

A study using stuffed bird models found that small birds are less likely to approach common cuckoos (a brood parasite), which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk (mimicry) helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.

The Eurasian sparrowhawk&#x27;s small bill is used for plucking feathers and pulling prey apart rather than killing or cutting. Its long legs and toes are an adaptation for catching and eating birds. The outer toe is fairly long and slender; the inner toe and back toe are relatively short and thick. The middle toe is very long and can be used to grasp objects, and a protuberance on the underside of the toe means that the digit can be closed without leaving a gap, which helps with gripping.

The flight is a characteristic flap-flap-glide, with the glide creating an undulating pattern. This species is similar in size to the Levant sparrowhawk, but larger than the shikra (the calls are however different); the male is only slightly larger than the merlin. Because of the overlap in sizes, the female can be confused with the similarly sized male Eurasian Goshawk, but lacks the bulk of that species. Eurasian sparrowhawks are smaller, more slender and have shorter wings, a square-ended tail and fly with faster wingbeats. A confusion species in China is the besra, although &quot;A. n. melaschistos&quot; is considerably larger.

In Great Britain, Eurasian sparrowhawks living further north are bigger than their more southerly counterparts, with wing length (the most reliable indicator of body size) increasing by an average of in males, and in females, for each degree further north.

== Lifespan and demography ==
The oldest known wild Eurasian sparrowhawk lived more than two decades; it was found dead in Denmark 20 years and 3 months after having been ringed. The typical lifespan is four years. Data analysis by the British Trust for Ornithology shows that the proportion of juveniles surviving their first year of life is 34%; adult survival from one year to the next is 69%. Birds in their first year of life weigh less than adults, and are especially light in the first two months after reaching independence. There is probably high mortality, especially for young males, during this time. A study in southern Scotland suggested that the greater mortality in young male birds may be due to their smaller size and the smaller size of their prey, which means that they can &quot;last less long between meals&quot;. Their size also means that their range of prey is restricted. It has been estimated that a female Eurasian sparrowhawk of average weight could survive for seven days without feeding – three days longer than a male of average weight.

A study of female Eurasian sparrowhawks found &quot;strong evidence&quot; that their rate of survival increased for the first three years of life, and declined for the last five to six years. Senescence (ageing) was the cause of the decline as the birds became older.

== Distribution and habitat ==

A widespread species throughout the temperate and subtropical parts of the Old World, the Eurasian sparrowhawk is resident or breeds in an estimated global range of and had an estimated population of 1.5 million birds in 2009. Although global population trends have not been analysed, numbers seem to be stable, so it has been classified as being of least concern by IUCN. The race &quot;granti&quot;, with 100 pairs resident on Madeira and 200 pairs on the Canary Islands, is threatened by loss of habitat, egg-collecting and illegal hunting, and is listed on Annex I of the European Commission Birds Directive. It is one of the most common birds of prey in Europe, along with the common kestrel and common buzzard. The Norwegian and Albanian populations are declining and, in many parts of Europe, Eurasian sparrowhawks are still shot. However, this low-level persecution has not affected the populations badly. In the UK, the population increased by 108% between 1970 and 2005, but saw a 1% decline over 1994–2006. In Ireland it is the most common bird of prey, breeding even near the city centre of Dublin, where it frequents parks and large gardens.

This species is prevalent in most woodland types in its range, and also in more open country with scattered trees. Eurasian sparrowhawks prefer to hunt the edges of wooded areas, but migrant birds can be seen in any habitat. The increased proportion of medium-aged stands of trees created by modern forestry techniques have benefited &quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;, according to a Norwegian study. Unlike its larger relative the Eurasian Goshawk, it can be seen in gardens and in urban areas and will even breed in city parks if they have a certain density of tall trees.

Eurasian sparrowhawks from colder regions of northern Europe and Asia migrate south for the winter, some to north Africa (some as far as equatorial east Africa) and India; members of the southern populations are resident or disperse. Juveniles begin their migration earlier than adults and juvenile females move before juvenile males. Analysis of ringing data collected at Heligoland, Germany, found that males move further and more often than females; of migrating birds ringed at Kaliningrad, Russia, the average distance moved before recovery (when the ring is read and the bird&#x27;s whereabouts reported subsequently) was for males and for females.

A study of Eurasian sparrowhawks in southern Scotland found that ringed birds which had been raised on &quot;high grade&quot; territories were recovered in greater proportion than birds which came from &quot;low grade&quot; territories. This suggested that the high grade territories produced young which survived better. The recovery rate also declined with increased elevation of the ground. After the post-fledging period, female birds dispersed greater distances than did males.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Diet and predation ===

The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a major predator of smaller woodland birds, though only 10% of its hunting attacks are successful. It hunts by surprise attack, using hedges, tree-belts, copses, orchards and other cover near woodland areas; its choice of habitat is dictated by these requirements. It also makes use of gardens in built-up areas, taking advantage of the prey found there.

It waits, hidden, for birds to come near, then breaks cover and flies out fast and low. A chase may follow, with the hawk even flipping upside-down to grab the victim from below or following it on foot through vegetation. It can &quot;stoop&quot; onto prey from a great height. Ian Newton describes seven modes of hunting used by Eurasian sparrowhawks:
* Short-stay-perch-hunting
* High soaring and stooping
* Contour-hugging in flight
* Still-hunting
* Low quartering
* Hunting by sound
* Hunting on foot

The sparrowhawk bears numerous adaptations that allow it to fly at speed low to the ground and hunt in confined spaces; these include its blunted wings, which allow it to fly through narrow gaps in hedges and fences, and its long, square-edged tail, which the bird uses to aid itself in carrying out tight turns, such as those required to negotiate close stands of trees.

Male Eurasian sparrowhawks regularly kill birds weighing up to and sometimes up to or more; females can tackle prey up to or more. A recent study found that on average, female sparrowhawk prey were two and a half times heavier than that of the male. The weight of food consumed by adult birds daily is estimated to be for males and for females. During one year, a pair of Eurasian sparrowhawks could take 2,200 house sparrows, 600 common blackbirds or 110 wood pigeons. Species that feed in the open, far from cover, or are conspicuous by their behaviour or coloration, are taken more often by Eurasian sparrowhawks. For example, great tits and house sparrows are vulnerable to attack. Eurasian sparrowhawks may account for more than 50% of deaths in certain species, but the extent varies from area to area.

Males tend to take tits, finches, sparrows and buntings; females often take thrushes and starlings. More than 120 bird species have been recorded as prey and individual Eurasian sparrowhawks may specialise in certain prey. The birds taken are usually adults or fledglings, though chicks in the nest and carrion are sometimes eaten. Small mammals, including mice, bats, voles, squirrels, shrews, and young rabbits, are sometimes caught but insects are eaten only very rarely.

Small birds are killed on impact or when squeezed by the Eurasian sparrowhawk&#x27;s foot, especially the two long claws. Larger quarry (such as doves and magpies) may not die immediately but succumb during feather plucking and eating. Victims which struggle are &quot;kneaded&quot; by the hawk, using its talons to squeeze and stab. When dealing with large prey species which peck and flap, the hawk&#x27;s long legs help in restraining the prey. It stands on top of its prey to pluck and pull it apart. The feathers are plucked and usually the breast muscles are eaten first. The bones are left, but can be broken using the notch in the bill. Like other birds of prey, Eurasian sparrowhawks produce pellets containing indigestible parts of their prey. These range from long and wide and are round at one end and more narrow and pointed at the other. They are usually composed of small feathers, as the larger ones are plucked and not consumed.
During hunting, this species can fly per day. It rises above tree level mostly to display, soar above territory and to make longer journeys. A study in a forested area of Norway found that the mean size of the home ranges was for males, and for females, which was larger than studies in Great Britain had found, &quot;probably due to lower land productivity and associated lower densities of prey species in the [Norwegian study area]&quot;.

A study looked at the effect on the population of blue tits in an area where a pair of Eurasian sparrowhawks began to breed in 1990. It found that the annual adult survival rate for the tits in that area dropped from 0.485 to 0.376 (the rate in adjacent plots did not change). The size of the breeding population was not changed, but there were fewer non-breeding blue tits in the population. In woodland, Eurasian sparrowhawks account for the deaths of a third of all young great tits; the two alarm calls given by great tits when mobbing a predator, and when fleeing from a nearby hawk, are within the optimum hearing range of both prey and predator; however, the high-pitched alarm call given when a distant flying Eurasian sparrowhawk is seen &quot;can only be heard well by the tit&quot;. In Sussex, the impact of Eurasian sparrowhawk predation on grey partridges was highest when the partridge density was lowest. A 10-year study in Scotland showed that Eurasian sparrowhawks did not select the common redshanks they predated according to the waders&#x27; size or condition, probably because of the hawks&#x27; surprise-attack hunting technique. In Britain, the increase in population of the Eurasian sparrowhawk coincides with the decline of the house sparrow population.

Another study found that the risk of predation for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or Eurasian Goshawk increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite &quot;Leucocytozoon&quot;, and birds with avian malaria were 16 times more likely to be killed.

=== Predators ===
Natural predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk include the barn owl, the tawny owl, the Eurasian Goshawk, the peregrine falcon, the golden eagle, the eagle owl, the red fox, the stone marten and the pine marten.

=== Breeding ===

The Eurasian sparrowhawk breeds in well-grown, extensive areas of woodland, often coniferous or mixed, preferring forest with a structure neither too dense nor too open, to allow a choice of flight paths. The nest can be located in the fork of a tree, often near the trunk and where two or three branches begin, on a horizontal branch in the lower canopy, or near the top of a tall shrub. If available, conifers are preferred. A new nest is built every year, generally close to the nest of the previous year, and sometimes using an old wood pigeon (&quot;A. n. melaschistos&quot; frequently uses the old nests of jungle crows) nest as a base; the male does most of the work. The structure, made of loose twigs up to long, has an average diameter of . When the eggs are laid, a lining of fine twigs or bark chippings is added.

During the breeding season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses a small amount of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after the breeding cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.

Sexual maturity is reached at between 1–3 years. Most Eurasian sparrowhawks stay on the same territory for one breeding season, though others keep the same one for up to eight years. A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory. Older birds tend to stay in the same territory; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely. The birds which kept the same territories had higher nest success, though it did not increase between years; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory.

=== Eggs ===

The eggs are pale blue with brown spots and each measure x , and weigh about of which 8% is shell in a healthy egg. Usually a clutch of four or five eggs is laid. The eggs are generally laid in the morning with an interval of 2–3 days between each egg. If a clutch is lost, up to two further eggs may be laid that are smaller than the earlier eggs.

=== Young ===
The altricial, downy chicks hatch after 33 days of incubation. After hatching, the female cares for and feeds the chicks for the first 8–14 days of life, and also during bad weather after that. The male provides food, up to six kills per day in the first week increasing to eight per day in the third and 10 per day in the last week in the nest, by which time the female is also hunting.

By 24–28 days after hatching, the young birds start to perch on branches near the nest and take their first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30 days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive the same amount of food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite &quot;Leucocytozoon toddi&quot; can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly because of the number of birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.

== Threats ==
=== Pollutants ===

The Eurasian sparrowhawk population in Europe crashed in the second half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and &#x27;70s.

In the United Kingdom, the species almost became extinct in East Anglia, where the chemicals were most widely used; in western and northern parts of the country, where the pesticides were not used, there were no declines. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds bought its Coombes Valley nature reserve in Staffordshire because it was the only Eurasian sparrowhawk breeding site left in the English Midlands.

In the UK, the use of cyclodienes as seed dressings for autumn-sown cereals was banned in 1975 and the levels of the chemicals present in the bird population began to fall. The population has largely recovered to pre-decline levels, with an increase seen in many areas, for example northern Europe. In Sweden, the population also decreased drastically from the 1950s, but recovered again once organochlorines were banned in the 1970s.

In the UK, the failure rate at the egg stage had decreased from 17% to 6% by the year 2000, and the population had stabilised after reaching a peak in the 1990s. A study of the eggs of Dutch Eurasian sparrowhawks found that contamination with Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) – a &quot;very persistent compound&quot; produced when DDT breaks down – continued into the 1980s, though a decline in the number of clutches with broken eggs during the 1970s suggested decreasing levels of the chemical.

Body tissue samples from Eurasian sparrowhawks are still analysed as part of the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme conducted by the UK government&#x27;s Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Although the average liver concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Eurasian sparrowhawks were lower in birds that died in 2005 compared to those that died in 2004, there was not a significant or consistent decline in residues between 2000 and 2005.

=== Conflict with humans ===
The Eurasian sparrowhawk&#x27;s adaptation for feeding on birds has brought it into conflict with humans; in the 19th century it was described as &quot;the great enemy of small quadrupeds and birds, and often very destructive to young chicks in poultry-yards in the breeding season&quot; and &quot;very destructive to partridges&quot;. Writing for gamekeepers in 1851, T. B. Johnson recommended that: &quot;The nest of this bird should be diligently sought ... and destroyed, shooting the parent birds first, if possible.&quot;
It was written in 1870 that &quot;The sparrowhawk is perhaps only the true enemy of the game-preserver; though at the same time it is probable that if the good and evil it does were justly weighed, the balance would be in favour of the hawk, its favourite quarry being the wood pigeon, which is now increasing to an extent injurious to agriculture.&quot; Parish records of the 18th century for Aldworth, Berkshire, in southern England, show that payments were made for 106 Eurasian sparrowhawks&#x27; heads, at the same time as efforts were being made to control the numbers of sparrows.

The species suffered heavy persecution by 18th-century European landowners and gamekeepers, but withstood attempts to eradicate it. For example, on the estate at Sandringham in Norfolk, 1,645 &#x27;hawks&#x27; were killed between 1938 and 1950, with 1,115 taken between 1919 and 1926 at Langwell and Sandside in Caithness, Scotland.

The population was able to quickly replace lost birds – there is a high proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers&#x27; more successful efforts to wipe out the Eurasian Goshawk and pine marten – predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk – may have benefited it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.

In the United Kingdom, research into the effect of predators on bird populations has been &quot;a contentious issue&quot;, with &quot;perceived conflict between the interests of nature conservationists and those involved in game shooting&quot;. Declines in the populations of some British songbirds since the 1960s have coincided with considerable changes in agricultural practices and also large increases in the numbers of Eurasian sparrowhawks and European magpies. When the Eurasian sparrowhawk population declined because of organochlorine use, there was no great increase in the populations of songbirds. In a 1949–1979 study of 13 passerine species breeding in a 40-acre (16-hectare) oakwood at Bookham Commons, Surrey, England, none was present in significantly greater numbers when Eurasian sparrowhawks were absent from the wood.

Many studies, mostly short-term, failed to find an effect on songbird populations caused by predatory birds such as Eurasian sparrowhawks. But analysis of long-term, large-scale national data from the UK&#x27;s Common Bird Census demonstrated that the declines in farmland songbird populations since the 1960s are unlikely to have been caused by increased predation by Eurasian sparrowhawks and magpies. The results of the study indicated that patterns of year-to-year songbird population change were the same at different sites, whether the predators were present or not. Another study, which examined the effects of predators – including the Eurasian sparrowhawk and introduced grey squirrel – on UK passerine populations, found that &quot;whilst a small number of associations may suggest significant negative effects between predator and prey species, for the majority of the songbird species examined there is no evidence that increases in common avian predators or grey squirrels are associated with large-scale population declines.&quot;

Racing pigeon owners in Great Britain have said for many years that Eurasian sparrowhawks and peregrine falcons &quot;cause serious and escalating losses&quot; of pigeons and some have called for these birds of prey to be killed or removed from areas surrounding homing pigeon lofts.

In Scotland, a two-year study published in 2004, and funded by Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Homing Union (SHU), found there was &quot;no evidence that birds of prey cause major losses of racing pigeons at lofts or during races.&quot; It reported that 56% of racing pigeons were lost each year but that the proportion taken by Eurasian sparrowhawks – &quot;often blamed for major losses&quot; – was less than 1%, with at least 2% taken by peregrine falcons. The study was carried out by the Central Science Laboratory; researchers worked with SHU members who provided data, information on pigeon rings found at peregrine falcon nests and pigeon carcasses.

From January to April 2009, the Scottish Government conducted a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost £25,000, was supported by the Scottish Homing Union, representing the country&#x27;s 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds&#x27; breeding season. It was criticised by the government&#x27;s own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The findings, released in January 2010, showed that only seven Eurasian sparrowhawks had been removed from the area from five pigeon lofts. One hawk returned twice to the area of the loft, while new birds began to visit two other lofts. The report found that &quot;The quantity and quality of the observational data collected meant that it was impossible to draw any firm conclusions&quot; and the government stated that &quot;no further research involving the trapping or translocation of raptors&quot; would take place, while the SHU maintained that it was &quot;very optimistic that licensed trapping and translocation could at last provide some protection.&quot;

Eurasian sparrowhawks are an effective urban adapter species in the UK and are thus non-threatened, however, recent search has suggested that they are prone to colliding with man-made structures such as buildings when hunting.

=== Falconry ===

The Eurasian sparrowhawk has been used in falconry for centuries and was favoured by Emperor Akbar the Great (1542–1605) of the Mughal Empire. There is a tradition of using migrant Eurasian sparrowhawks to catch common quail in Tunisia and Georgia, where there are 500 registered &quot;bazieri&quot; (sparrowhawkers) and a monument to &quot;bazieri&quot; in the city of Poti. Eurasian sparrowhawks are also popular in Ireland. At Cap Bon in Tunisia, and in Turkey, thousands are captured each year by falconers and used for hunting migrant common quails. Although they were formerly released at the end of the season, many are now kept because of the scarcity of migrants.

In 17th century England, the Eurasian sparrowhawk was used by priests, reflecting their lowly status; whereas in the Middle Ages, they were favoured by ladies of noble and royal status because of their small size. The falconer&#x27;s name for a male Eurasian sparrowhawk is a &quot;musket&quot;; this is derived from the Latin word &quot;musca&quot;, meaning &#x27;a fly&#x27;, via the Old French word &quot;moschet&quot;.

&quot;An austringer [falconer] undertaking to train a sparrowhawk should be in no doubt that he is taking on one of the most difficult hawks available.&quot; A female Eurasian sparrowhawk is considered a bad choice for a novice and the male is very difficult and demanding, even for an experienced handler. They have been described as &quot;hysterical little hawks&quot; but are also praised as courageous and providing &quot;sport of the highest quality&quot;. Philip Glasier describes Eurasian sparrowhawks as &quot;in many ways superior to hunting with a larger short-wing [hawk]&quot; and &quot;extremely hard to tame&quot;. They are best suited for small quarry such as common starlings and common blackbirds but are also capable of taking common teal, Eurasian magpies, pheasants and partridges. A 19th century author remarked that this species was &quot;the best of all hawks for landrails&quot;, now known as corn crakes. In 1735, the &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; noted that &quot;... she will serve in the winter as well as in the summer, and will fly at all kind of game more than the falcon. If a winter sparrowhawk prove good, she will kill the pye, the chough, the jay, woodcock, thrush, black-bird, fieldfare, and divers[e] other birds of the like nature.&quot;

== In culture ==

In Slavic mythology, the sparrowhawk, known as &quot;krahui&quot; or &quot;krahug&quot;, is a sacred bird in Old Bohemian songs and lives in a grove of the gods. Holy sparrowhawks perch on the branches of an oak tree that grows from the grave of a murdered man, and &quot;publish the foul deed&quot;. The South Slavic name for this bird, &quot;kobac&quot; or &quot;skobec&quot;, comes from Proto-Slavic &quot;kob&quot; (doom), indicating that omens were read from its flight. It also features in Teutonic mythology. In some areas of England, it was believed that the common cuckoo turned into a Eurasian sparrowhawk in winter. The surname &quot;Spearhafoc&quot;, later Sparhawk, Sparrowhawk was in use as a personal name in England before the Norman conquest of England in 1066.

In 1695, John Aubrey wrote in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;:
Not long before the Death of King Charles II a sparrow-hawk escaped from the Perch, and pitched on one of the Iron Crowns of the White Tower, and entangling its string in the Crown, hung by the heels and died. T&#x27;was considered very ominous, and so it proved.

The musket, or musquet, originally a kind of crossbow bolt, and later a small cannon, was named after the male Eurasian sparrowhawk because of its size. The British Gloster Aircraft Company named one of their Mars series craft the Sparrowhawk.

In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, Mrs Ford greets Robin, Falstaff&#x27;s page, with the words &quot;How now, my eyas musket&quot;, &quot;eyas musket&quot; meaning a lively young man (an eyas is a hawk nestling). The British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes wrote a poem entitled &quot;A Sparrow-Hawk&quot; which refers to this species. Hermann Hesse mentioned this bird in his book &quot;Demian&quot; and the bird is also referred to in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; by Richard Francis Burton:
Good sooth my bones, wheneas they hear thy name
Quail as birds quailed when Nisus o&#x27;er them flew

The Eurasian sparrowhawk was written about by Alfred, Lord Tennyson:

A sparhawk proud did hold in wicked jail
Music&#x27;s sweet chorister, the Nightingale
To whom with sighs she said: &#x27;O set me free,
And in my song I&#x27;ll praise no bird but thee.&#x27;
The Hawk replied: &#x27;I will not lose my diet
To let a thousand such enjoy their quiet.&#x27;

It also appears in Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;.

<doc id="321590" wikidata="Q1087869" url="?curid=321590" title="100 Series Shinkansen">
<text>The was a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed electric multiple unit which operated between 1985 and 2012 on the Tokaido Shinkansen and Sanyo Shinkansen high-speed lines. They were introduced after the 200 series trains, but their numbering is such because in the days of Japanese National Railways (JNR), Shinkansen types running east of Tokyo were given even numbers and those west of Tokyo odd numbers, hence they were given the next odd number in line after 0, 100. The last remaining examples of the type were withdrawn from service following the last runs on 16 March 2012.

==Overview==
As a full-scale redesign of the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen, a total of 1,056 cars were manufactured and put into service between 1985 and 1992, consisting of 66 16-car sets. The train was the first to incorporate the double-decker cars used in Kintetsu Railway&#x27;s Vista Cars and in railways in Europe and the United States, and was the first to be used in JNR and Shinkansen trains, leading to increased seating capacity and improved service, which helped promote the Shinkansen and improved its image. In terms of interior and technology, many of the equipment and technologies were later installed in Shinkansen trains produced thereafter.

The train capacity and manufacturing costs were set to be the same as those of the 0 Series, and the aim was to shorten travel times while minimizing improvements to ground facilities. In addition, it was developed with the intention of being a &quot;symbol of JNR reform,&quot; and the development goal was set to be &quot;customers first, crew members second&quot;.

This model was the mainstay on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines from the end of the JNR era until the launch of JR, but with the introduction of successor vehicles, it was withdrawn from service on the Tokaido Shinkansen on September 16, 2003, and from service on the Sanyo Shinkansen on March 16, 2012.

==Design==

They differed visibly from the earlier 0 series in that the nose profile was more pointed. Another less obvious difference with the 16-car sets was that not all the cars were powered; the driving cars on each end were unpowered, as were the two bi-level centre cars. Some later production sets had powered driving cars and four unpowered bi-level trailers in the middle instead. The bi-level trailer cars contained a combination of restaurant cars, and first class compartments, or open-plan first class seating and first class compartments, or open-plan first class seating and refreshment cars. The arrangement of the lights in the signal lights has been changed from two vertical lights in the 0-series to two horizontal lights, giving it a long, narrow shape. This design was proposed by Kinki Sharyo and adopted. When the front signal lights are on, they remain on, and when the rear signal lights are on, a red filter is automatically attached, making them appear to be on in red.

The external livery was white (White No. 3) and blue (Blue No. 20).

Following their removal from front-line service, 100 series sets were later reformed into shorter four- and six-car sets for the slower &quot;Kodama&quot; services on the Sanyo Shinkansen line. These four- and six-car trains did not have bi-level cars.

==Variants==

===Pre-series unit===
Originally numbered X0, the pre-series set X1 was delivered in 1985, with test running commencing from 27 March that year. The X1 set entered revenue service for passenger evaluation trials on the &quot;Hikari&quot; services from 1 October 1985. This unit differed externally from later production units in having small windows aligned with each seating bay, and also had a slanting headlight arrangement. The type 116 Green (first class) car formed as car 10 initially included one two-seat and two single-seat compartments, but these were removed when the set was modified to full-production standard in 1986.

Set X0 was formed as shown below, with car 1 at the end.

Set X1 was withdrawn in March 2000.

===16-car X sets===

Following passenger evaluation trials with the pre-series set X1, a total of seven X sets were built for use on Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;Hikari&quot; services. The first four production units entered service from 13 June 1986 as 12-car sets without bilevel trailer cars, numbered G1 to G4, and were used on Tokaido &quot;Kodama&quot; services until October in the same year. These sets were formed as shown below.

Cars 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 were each fitted with cross-arm pantographs.

These units were subsequently renumbered as 16-car sets X2 to X5 with the inclusion of bilevel trailer cars, and were introduced on &quot;Hikari&quot; services from November 1986.

The noticeable difference over previous (0 series and 200 series) shinkansen designs was the inclusion of two bilevel trailer cars in the centre of the formation. The type 168 car had a restaurant area on the upper deck with kitchen facilities and a small buffet counter on the lower deck. The adjacent type 149 car provided private compartments for Green class passengers on the lower deck, with open-plan green car accommodation on the upper deck.

From March 1998, the X sets were redeployed to Tokaido &quot;Kodama&quot; services. The restaurant cars were no longer used, and fittings were subsequently removed. The fleet of X sets contained the oldest members of the 100 series fleet, and the first withdrawals started in August 1999. From the new timetable change of 2 October 1999, X sets were no longer assigned to regular workings, with the remaining examples subsequently limited to holiday period extra trains. The last remaining units were withdrawn by April 2000.

====Formation====
The 16-car X sets were formed as follows.
Cars 2, 6, and 12 were equipped with cross-arm pantographs. (The pantographs on cars 4, 10, and 14 were removed in 1995.)

===16-car G sets===
The G sets were officially classified as &quot;100 series&quot;, and 50 units were built from 1988. They differed from the initial X sets in having a type 148 bilevel trailer car in place of the type 168 restaurant car. This had open-plan Green car accommodation on the upper deck, and a self-service cafeteria area on the lower deck. While originally used exclusively on &quot;Hikari&quot; services, in later years, these units were more commonly seen on Tokaido &quot;Kodama&quot; services. The last remaining sets owned by JR Central and JR-West were withdrawn in September 2003 before the start of the new Tokaido Shinkansen timetable the following October.

====Formation====
The 16-car G sets were formed as follows.
Cars 2, 6, and 12 were equipped with cross-arm pantographs.

===16-car V sets (100-3000 series)===

The nine V sets (also referred to as &quot;100N&quot;) operated by JR-West included four bilevel trailer cars, which provided 2+2 standard class reserved seating accommodation on the lower decks, and restaurant and Green class accommodation on the upper decks. These sets originally ran under the marketing name &quot;Grand Hikari&quot;, but from May 2002 onwards were limited to use on the Sanyo Shinkansen only. The restaurant cars in these units were decommissioned from March 2000. Two V sets (V1, V6) were reformed as new 4-car P sets in 2000 to replace life-expired 0 series Q sets on Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; services, and the remaining sets were subsequently used to donate cars as they were withdrawn. The last operational set, V2 (with four bilevel trailer cars from set V9), was withdrawn after being used on special &quot;Sayonara Grand Hikari&quot; runs in November 2002.

====Formation====
The 16-car V sets were formed as follows.
Cars 4, 6, 12, and 14 were equipped with cross-arm pantographs.

===4-car P sets===
The first of two reformed 4-car P sets was introduced on Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; services from October 2000. P1 was reformed from set V1, with the traction motors in the two end cars (renumbered in -5000 series) replaced by those from surplus JR-West G set cars. P2 was reformed from unit V6 in October 2000. Subsequent sets P3 and P4 were formed in 2001 by transplanting the cab sections of surplus non-powered G set cars onto powered intermediate cars renumbered into the 121-5050 and 122-5050 series. Set P1 was the first to be repainted into the new JR-West &quot;fresh green&quot; &quot;Kodama&quot; livery, in August 2002, and the entire fleet of twelve sets (P1–P12) had been similarly treated by March 2005.

====Formation====
Cars 2 and 4 were equipped with cross-arm pantographs.

====Interior====
The first three sets (P1 to P3) were refurbished in February and March 2002 with 2+2 abreast seating using former &quot;West Hikari&quot; seats. Sets from P4 onward (formed in August 2001) had 2+2 seating from the outset.

Set P2 was withdrawn on 9 February 2009, and moved to the JR-West training centre at Shimonoseki, where it replaced the former 0 series set Q3 as a static training set. P2&#x27;s role as a training set ended in March 2013.

The last P sets in revenue service were withdrawn by 11 March 2011.

===6-car K sets===
The first six-car K set (K51) was formed in January 2002 for use on Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; services from February 2002. These sets feature 2+2 abreast seating throughout, utilizing former Green class seats from withdrawn 100 series cars. Sets started appearing in the new JR-West &quot;Kodama&quot; livery from August 2002, with all ten sets (K51–K60) similarly treated by August 2004.

Three K sets were returned to the original white/blue livery from July 2010. The first set treated, K53, was returned to traffic on 14 July 2010.

These sets were withdrawn from service on 16 March 2012.

====Formation====
Cars 2 and 6 were equipped with cross-arm pantographs.

<text>Sir Gordon Wu Ying-sheung (; born 1935, Hong Kong) is a Hong Kong businessman. He is the chairman of the board of Hong Kong-listed Asian infrastructure firm Hopewell Holdings Ltd.

==Background==

Wu studied engineering at the University of Manitoba in 1953, then transferred to Princeton University. Wu graduated from Princeton with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering (BSc.Eng.) in 1958, and currently serves as a trustee for the university. Before that, he attended Wah Yan College, a Jesuit secondary school in Hong Kong.

As one of the founders of Hopewell, he was the managing director from 1972 to 2002. In January 2002, he retired as the managing director of the company but remains as chairman of the board. He was responsible for Hopewell&#x27;s infrastructure projects in mainland China and Southeast Asia and has been involved in the design and construction of many buildings and development projects in Hong Kong and mainland China. He is also the chairman of Hopewell Highway Infrastructure Limited, subsidiary of Hopewell listed in August 2003, and an independent non-executive director of i-Cable Communications Limited.

In 1984, Wu donated US$5 million worth of his company shares to Princeton University and formed a charity fund. Wu also pledged US$100 million to the university, a sum he planned to make available for university use in 2008, on the occasion of his 50th reunion. In a talk given in October 2006, however, Wu revealed intentions of making the contribution available to the university sooner. He completed this pledge, with the last payment in 2006–2007.

He is Chairman of the Council of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

==Business==
Wu has been an advocate for more than two decades for the construction of Asia&#x27;s largest bridge project linking Hong Kong, Macau, and China&#x27;s Zhuhai city. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project was given support by the PRC government in August 2003. The bridge traverses two man-made islands, allowing it to go through an undersea tunnel and let shipping pass. The concept is based on the existing Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia, United States.

Since the 1980s, Wu has steered Hopewell Holdings towards developing his vision of creating an advanced transport system for China&#x27;s manufacturing powerhouse in the Pearl River Delta, which includes much of Guangdong Province and makes use of its proximity to Hong Kong to access professional services and logistics.

Wu has predicted that commercial development in Hong Kong will focus upon the growth of four major pillar industries including retailing, tourism, and logistics. He predicts a diminishing role for the property and textiles industries.

Gordon Wu designed the first build-operate-transfer (BOT) project for the China Hotel in 1979, thus &quot;leading the way&quot; into China. Wu and Hopewell went on to build power plants (Shajiao B and C) and other infrastructure projects in China, using the BOT structure.

==Political stance==
Gordon Wu has spoken out in opposition to the development of democracy in Hong Kong. He joined more than 80 of Hong Kong&#x27;s richest business tycoons and their heirs apparent headed for Beijing on 26 September 2003 on an annual pilgrimage. The same year, he told the Chinese University of Hong Kong executive MBA programme that he opposed direct elections in Hong Kong which, he believed, would cause many problems. Noting that only 10 per cent of Hong Kong citizens pay taxes, with the remaining 90 per cent receiving subsidies in various forms, e.g., public housing, healthcare, and education, if direct elections were introduced, this group would, with the help of the politicians they had voted in, &quot;get not only free lunches, but free dinners and breakfasts.&quot;

In the run up to the December 2005 protest for democracy in Hong Kong, he said that demonstrators are mobs, and democracy is mobocracy. At a meeting attended by then Vice President Xi Jinping in 2010, he stated, &quot;A small number of people ... are against everything the SAR government wants to do and against everything that&#x27;s from the central government. They are also using such slogans as &#x27;uprising&#x27; and &#x27;liberation&#x27;. These show they have hidden purposes.&quot;

<text>The was a Shinkansen high-speed train type introduced by Japanese National Railways (JNR) for the Tohoku Shinkansen and Joetsu Shinkansen high-speed rail lines in Japan, and operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) until 2013. They actually predated the 100 series trains, having been built between 1980 and 1986. It was one of the two recipients of the 23rd Laurel Prize presented by the Japan Railfan Club, the first Shinkansen type to receive that award. The last remaining sets were retired from regular service in March 2013, and were completely withdrawn from service in April 2013.

==Design==
The 200 Series Shinkansen trains resembled the earlier 0 series trains in styling (some later units had the pointed &#x27;shark nose&#x27; of the 100 series), but were lighter and more powerful, since these two lines are mountain routes and have steeper gradients. These lines are also prone to snowfall and the trains had small snowplows fitted, as well as protection of equipment against snow.

They were originally painted in ivory with a green window band and lower bodyside band, but a number of sets were refurbished and painted into a white-upper/dark blue-lower scheme with new wrap-around cab windows from 1999.

The first units were capable of but later ones can do , and four were converted to be capable of . Some units were also modified with retractable couplers in the nose for coupling with Yamagata Shinkansen &quot;Tsubasa&quot; and Akita Shinkansen &quot;Komachi&quot; Mini-shinkansen sets. In addition, some of the later 200 series Shinkansen trains were fitted with double-deck cars, which had semi-open standard-class compartments on the lower deck and green class (first class) seating on the upper deck. These too have been removed from service.

Withdrawal of the earlier units began in 1997, and the last remaining unrefurbished set was withdrawn in May 2007.

==Variants==
Since their introduction in 1982, the 200 series sets have been operated in a number of different formations as described below.

===E sets (1982–1993)===
12-car sets for Tōhoku Shinkansen &quot;Yamabiko&quot; and &quot;Aoba&quot; services, and for Jōetsu Shinkansen &quot;Asahi&quot; and &quot;Toki&quot; services. These had a maximum speed of , and remained in service until early 1993.

The 12-car E sets were formed as follows.
===F sets (1983–2007)===
12-car 200-1000 series sets with a maximum speed of which were introduced in November 1983.

From March 1990, four selected 12-car F sets (F90–F93, formerly F54, F59, F14, F16) were upgraded allowing them to run at a maximum of on a small number of down &quot;Asahi&quot; services. services were discontinued on the Jōetsu Shinkansen from 1998, with the introduction of E2 series trains, and the F90 sets were subsequently used interchangeably with other F sets.

Some F sets are similar to the H sets in that the driving trailer cars were built with a pointed nose, just like the latter. These trains however, feature a solid green line unlike the H sets, where they have two green lines, one thick and one thin, separated by a thin white section near the bottom.

====Formations====
The 12-car F sets were formed as follows, with car 1 at the Tokyo end. Car 11 was a Green (first class) car, and car 9 had a buffet counter.
Cars 2, 4, 10, and 12 were each fitted with one cross-arm pantograph. (3, 5, 7, and 9 for sets F90-93)

====Interior====

====Set F80====

One F set, F17, was specially modified at Sendai Depot between August 1997 and January 1998 for use on additional Nagano Shinkansen &quot;Asama&quot; services in February 1998 during the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano. The train was renumbered F80, and modifications included ability to operate on both 25 kV AC 50 Hz and 60 Hz overhead power supplies, weight-saving measures to comply with the 16 tonne axle load restriction, and additional control equipment to cope with the 30‰ gradient of the Nagano Shinkansen. Maximum speed was limited to when operating on the Nagano Shinkansen.

Seats in the end cars, cars 1 and 12, were replaced with 
E2 series-style seats to reduce weight.

The train was formed as follows, with car 1 at the Tokyo end. Car 11 was a Green (first class) car, and car 9 had a buffet counter.

Cars 2, 4, 8, and 10 were each fitted with one cross-arm pantograph.

After February 1998, set F80 was used interchangeably with other F sets, and remained in operation until 2004.

===G sets (1987–1999)===

10-car, and later 8-car, sets formed from the earlier 12-car E sets, with a maximum speed of . These entered service from 18 April 1987.

====Formations====
The initial 10-car G sets were formed as follows.
The 8-car G sets were formed as follows.
Cars 2, 4, 6, and 8 were equipped with cross-arm pantographs. Some sets had an &quot;Mpk&quot; car (numbered 225-400) in place of the 237 buffet car for car 11.

===H sets (1990–2005)===
Six 13-car and later 16-car sets (H1–H6) with a maximum speed of 240 km/h for use on &quot;Yamabiko&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Super Yamabiko&quot;) services, incorporating two bilevel Green cars (cars 9 and 10) These sets entered service from 23 June 1990.

Regular operations using 16-car H sets ended from the start of the revised timetable on 13 March 2004, but sets H4 and H5 were reinstated as 12-car sets from the summer of 2004 for seasonal use with their Green cars removed. These two sets survived until mid-2005.

====Formations====
The initial 13-car H sets were formed as follows.
The 16-car H sets were formed as follows.
Cars 2, 4, 8, 12, and 14 were each fitted with one cross-arm pantograph.

The 12-car H sets (H4 &amp; H5) were formed as follows.
Cars 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 were each fitted with one cross-arm pantograph.

===K sets (1992–2013)===
8-car and later 10-car sets with a maximum speed of modified with nose-end couplers to operate in conjunction with 400 series Yamagata Shinkansen sets and E3 series Akita Shinkansen sets.

The remaining sets in use on the Tōhoku Shinkansen were withdrawn from 19 November 2011, but 200 series sets continued to be used on the Jōetsu Shinkansen. The last remaining sets were withdrawn from regular service by the start of the revised timetable on 16 March 2013.

====Formations====
The K sets are formed as follows.

==Special event train services==

===Tohoku Shinkansen 25th anniversary===

On 23 June 2007, 10-car set K47 was used for a special &quot;Yamabiko&quot; 931 service from Omiya to Morioka to mark the 25th anniversary of the opening of the Tohoku Shinkansen. Set K47 was specially repainted back into its original ivory and green livery for this event.

===Tohoku Shinkansen 30th anniversary===
On 23 June 2012, 10-car set K47 was used for a special &quot;Yamabiko&quot; 235 service from Omiya to Morioka to mark the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Tohoku Shinkansen.

===Joetsu Shinkansen 30th anniversary===
On 17 November 2012, 10-car set K47 was used for a special service, running as &quot;Toki&quot; 395, from Omiya to Niigata.

===&quot;Sayonara 200 series Yamabiko&quot;===
On 30 March 2013, 10-car set K47 was used for a special train operated from Morioka to Tokyo, following the withdrawal of 200 series trains from regular scheduled services on 16 March.

===&quot;Arigato 200 series&quot;===
On 13 April 2013, a special service ran from Sendai to Ueno in Tokyo.

===&quot;Sayonara 200 series&quot;===
On 14 April 2013, 10-car set K47 was used for two final services from Niigata to Tokyo and from Omiya to Niigata, marking the last public operation of the 200 series trains.

==Derailment==

A refurbished 200 series train (set K25 on the &quot;Toki&quot; 325 service) derailed on the Jōetsu Shinkansen line while travelling at a speed of approximately between Nagaoka Station and Urasa Station on 23 October 2004 during the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake. Eight of the ten cars were derailed. This was the first derailment of a Shinkansen train in service. None of the 155 passengers on board were injured. Set K25 was officially withdrawn on 25 March 2005.

<doc id="321599" wikidata="Q1088154" url="?curid=321599" title="300 Series Shinkansen">
<text>The was a Japanese high-speed Shinkansen train type, with a top operational speed of 270 km/h (170 mph), which operated on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines in Japan between 1992 and 2012. When first introduced, they were used on the fastest &quot;Nozomi&quot; services, being capable of . As more were delivered (66 trains by 1998) they replaced earlier units on &quot;Hikari&quot; service and allowed the thus displaced 100 series units to finally in turn displace 0 series units on almost all services.

With the introduction of newer 700 series and N700 series equipment, the 300 series sets were gradually demoted to slower &quot;Hikari&quot; and &quot;Kodama&quot; services, and were completely withdrawn from Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen services by the start of the revised timetable on 17 March 2012.

==Design==
The front-end styling of these units consisted of a &#x27;curved wedge&#x27;, replacing the aircraft-style nose-cones of previous Shinkansen trains. The furthest forward point was the very bottom of the pilot. They were painted brilliant white with a medium-thick blue stripe beneath the windows.

They were only formed as sixteen-car sets and had no restaurant cars, though they did originally feature two refreshment counters (later removed).

Technically, they are notable for being the first Shinkansen sets to employ three-phase AC traction motors instead of direct current units, as well as new bolsterless bogies to reduce weight.

The 300 series was awarded the Laurel Prize in May 1993.

==Variants==
* 300-9000 series: 16-car pre-series set
* 300-0 series: 16-car &quot;J&quot; sets owned by JR Central, introduced from March 1992
* 300-3000 series: 16-car &quot;F&quot; sets owned by JR-West

==Pre-series 300-9000 series set==

The pre-series unit, J0, numbered in the 300-9000 series, was delivered on 8 March 1990, and underwent extensive testing and endurance running before the start of the new &quot;Nozomi&quot; services in March 1992. In the early hours of 1 March 1991, this set recorded a speed of 325.7 km/h on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen between and , a Japanese national speed record at the time.

The set was modified to production standards in March 1993, becoming set &quot;J1&quot;, but it differed from the production units in a number of ways. Visually, the driving cab had a different windscreen design, different headlight arrangement, and flared side panels over the front bogies. The prototype set was initially fitted with five pantographs, but this was later reduced to two in line with modifications to the production fleet. Limited water tank capacity meant that the unit was not capable of running return trips from Tokyo to Hakata, and was normally restricted to Tokyo to Osaka/Okayama/Hiroshima workings.

From 2001 onwards, this unit was converted for use as a JR Central test train for testing new digital ATC equipment on the Tokaido Shinkansen. It was finally withdrawn in March 2007. All cars except one end car, 322-9001, were cut up.

==JR Central J sets==

60 16-car sets (excluding pre-series set J1) operated by Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central). These sets were delivered between February 1992 and October 1998.

In December 1998, set J59 was fitted experimentally with new 700 series style single-arm pantographs and fairings to reduce noise and air resistance. Following testing, JR Central subsequently fitted new pantographs to all of its sets, with modifications completed by late 2002.

In October 2004, JR Central announced plans for ride improvement modifications to its 300 series fleet involving the addition of semi-active vibration control units to seven cars out of the total of sixteen in each set (end cars 1 and 16, pantograph cars 6 and 12, and Green cars 8 to 10), and also new non-linear air suspension on all cars in each set. The new secondary suspension offered firmer support against lateral movement. The entire fleet operated by JR Central received the modifications by February 2007.

With the entry into service of new N700 series trains, withdrawals of production 300 series sets began in July 2007 with the withdrawal of set J14.

The remaining fleet of JR Central 300 series sets were removed from regular scheduled services from 1 February 2012, and were completely withdrawn following the final runs on 16 March 2012.

===Formation===
The 16-car J sets were formed as follows, with car 1 at the Hakata end.
Cars 6 and 12 each had one single-arm pantograph.

===Interior===
==JR-West F sets (300-3000 series)==
These were 16-car 300 series sets operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR-West). A total of nine sets were delivered between December 1992 and September 1993.

Withdrawals of the JR-West F sets began in July 2011, with the withdrawal of set F5. The last remaining sets were withdrawn by spring 2012 and replaced by eight 700 series &quot;C&quot; sets transferred from JR Central.

===Formation===
The 16-car F sets were formed as follows, with car 1 at the Hakata end.
Cars 6 and 12 each had one single-arm pantograph.

<doc id="321602" wikidata="Q1087880" url="?curid=321602" title="400 Series Shinkansen">
<text>The was a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed train type operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) between 1992 and 2010 on &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services on Japan&#x27;s first mini-shinkansen line, the Yamagata Shinkansen branch from the main Tohoku Shinkansen.

The fleet of 400 series trains was leased by JR East from the owning company, , a third-sector company jointly owned by JR East and Yamagata Prefecture.

They were originally six-car sets, but a seventh car (type 429) was added in 1995 to each set due to the popularity of the new &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services.

==Pre-series set==
The pre-series set, S4, was delivered in October 1990, and shown off to the press on 26 October 1990. This was a six-car set arranged as shown below with all cars motored.

The unit featured three different types of bolster less bogies: DT9028 on cars 1 and 3, DT9029 on cars 2 and 4, and DT9030 on cars 5 and 6. The Green car seats featured seat-back TV screens, a feature not used on the subsequent production sets.

Test running began on the Ōu Main Line between and on 14 November 1990. From 23 January 1991, test running began in conjunction with a newly converted 200 series 8-car K set on the Tōhoku Shinkansen between and . On 26 March 1991, the 400 series set S4 established a new Japanese speed record of on the Jōetsu Shinkansen in the Yuzawa Tunnel between and . On 19 September 1991, the train set a new speed record of on the same stretch of track.

Test running continued into 1992, with set S4 reaching Tokyo for the first time on 20 May 1992. The pre-series set was then modified to bring it up to production batch standards, becoming set L1 on 29 June 1992.

==History==
===Introduction===
The fleet of 12 six-car sets entered service on the new &quot;Tsubasa&quot; shinkansen services from 1 July 1992. The six-car sets were all lengthened to seven cars due to the popularity of the &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services that they ran. This changed occured between November and December 1995 with the addition of a new type 429 trailer car as car 15.

===Withdrawal===
Withdrawals started in December 2008, with the first set, L1. The entire fleet was scheduled to be withdrawn by summer 2009 and replaced by new E3-2000 series trains. However, one set, L3, remained in service until 18 April 2010, with the date chosen to mark 18 years of service.This last 400 series Shinkansen was coupled to an E4 series during it&#x27;s last run.

===Preservation===
The first eleven sets to be withdrawn were all cut up at Sendai General Depot, but one car (Green car 411-3) of the last set to be withdrawn, L3, was stored at the former Fukushima depot before being moved to Omiya in Saitama Prefecture in December 2017 where it&#x27;s preserved at the Railway Museum.

==Formation==
The production 400 series sets were configured as shown below following the addition of a trailer car (car 15) in late 1995.

Cars 1 and 2 were built by Tokyu Car Corporation, cars 3 to 4 were built by Hitachi, and cars 5 to 6 were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Cars 12 and 14 were equipped with pantographs.

==Fleet details==
&quot;Source:&quot;

==Exterior==

In terms of style, the 400 series were originally painted a medium silver grey with a darker roof and area around the cab windows and underframe. However they were refurbished and repainted between 1999 and 2001, with a higher area of dark bluish-grey on the underside, coming up almost to the side windows, and separated from the silver grey with a green stripe. The dark grey on the roof and around the cab windows was removed.
Clearances were significantly reduced compared to previous Shinkansen lines, and thus the 400 series units were much narrower than previous Shinkansen trains. At shinkansen stations (i.e. high-speed line stations), steps extended from beneath the doors to bridge the gap between the trains and platforms.

==Interior==
Green car (first class) accommodations had 2+1 abreast seating, unlike the E3 series trains which replaced them, which featured 2+2 seating in both standard class and Green cars. Seat pitch was in Green class (car 11), in reserved-seating cars (12 to 15), and in non-reserved cars (16 and 17).

When the fleet received life-extension refurbishment between 1999 and 2001, the interiors were also refurbished with new seats moquette. The reserved seating cars received red moquette, while the non-reserved seating cars received turquoise moquette.

<text>Ron Kurtenbach (born January 6, 1943) is a Lincoln, Nebraska Communist. A community activist, he is one of the original group which founded local Lincoln radio station KZUM and the local grocery co-op Open Harvest. He is also one of the group which founded the short-lived Lincoln Communist music venue, The Red and Black Café, in the early 1990s, a spin-off to another talk program he produced with ex-wife Sally Herrin, noted Lincoln author and teacher, and a number of others called &quot;Zero Street&quot; (from the Allen Ginsberg poem &quot;Wichita Vortex Sutra&quot; in which Ginsburg called Lincoln&#x27;s main drag, O Street, &quot;Zero Street&quot;). Many Lincoln bands, including Plastik Trumpet and Hour Slave played at the Red and Black.

He was a long-time custodian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He received his Ph.D. in English in May 2000, and taught briefly at both the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and at Kearney.

Kurtenbach is most well known for his long-running controversial Public-access television call-in comedy show, &quot;Ron&#x27;s World&quot;, that was seen nightly on local Lincoln cable TV. On the program, he explained the basics of Marxist thinking, read poetry and spent most of the time discussing his politics with the general public.

Prior to cable television, Kurtenbach was the editor/publisher of the &quot;Lincoln Gazette&quot;. His &quot;free or donation&quot; weekly paper featured everything from political perspectives to poetry to the cartoons of the talented, local cartoonist Scott Stewart (most notable among Stewart&#x27;s creations was &quot;Telegram Sam,&quot; the bomb-toting anarchist). By the late &#x27;70s, the &quot;Lincoln Gazette&quot; was available in Lincoln, Omaha and communities across Nebraska. A group dissatisfied with Kurtenbach left the &quot;Gazette&quot; to form the short-lived &quot;Nebraska Dispatch&quot;.

Kurtenbach&#x27;s stature as a local cult figure grew to the point that he once was invited to be the host of a public school &quot;celebrity&quot; basketball charity event.

Kurtenbach is married to wife Maria, and moved to China to teach English. Ron now lives in Portugal. Kurtenbach is the Father of two sons, and has three grandchildren.

<text>The is a Shinkansen high-speed train type operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR-West) in Japan on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen line from 1997 until 2010, and the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen line since 1997. They were designed to be capable of but operated at , until they were retired from the primary &quot;Nozomi&quot; service in 2010. The trainsets were then refurbished and downgraded to the all-stations &quot;Kodama&quot; service between and .

==Overview==
The general design concept was overseen by German industrial designer Alexander Neumeister. The running gear utilizes computer-controlled active suspension for a smoother, safer ride, and yaw dampers are fitted between cars for improved stability. All sixteen cars in each original trainset were powered, giving a maximum of . Each train cost an estimated 5 billion yen, and only nine were built. It used biomimicry to reduce energy consumption by 15%, increase speeds by 10% and reduce noise levels while increasing passenger comfort. This was done by designing the train&#x27;s front to mimic the shape of a kingfisher&#x27;s beak.

JR West developed the 500 Series with the aim of further increasing the speed of its Sanyo Shinkansen line, as part of efforts to strengthen its competitiveness against aircraft. The car body strength, bogie strength, and powering performance were all designed and planned for a speed of , and a total of 144 cars were manufactured between January 1996 and December 1998, in nine 16-car sets. 

One set was produced in January 1996, and eight sets were produced between July 1997 and December 1998, totalling nine sets, and 144 cars, by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (former cars 1-6), Kinki Sharyo (former cars 7 and 8), Hitachi Kasado Works (former cars 9, 10, 13-16), and Nippon Sharyo (former cars 11 and 12). At the time of manufacturing, each set consisted of 16 cars, and was designated W. They were produced in three batches (W1: first batch (pre-production), W2-W6: second batch, W7-W9: third batch).

It won the 41st (1998) Railway Friendship Club Blue Ribbon Award. In 1996, it was selected in the product design category of the Good Design Product Selection (now the Japan Design Promotion Organization Good Design Award) by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (now the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry). Even now that it is used on the Sanyo Shinkansen, it remains extremely popular and well-known, and is one of the most representative models of Japanese railway cars and JR West.

As of 2023, this is the only Shinkansen train developed by JR West alone. From 2024, the N700 series will be converted to eight-car trains at the Hakata General Rolling Stock Depot, and the remaining six trains of this type will be phased out by 2027.

==6-car 500-900 WIN350 set==

This was a prototype for the Series 500.

==16-car W sets==
First announced by JR-West in September 1994, the first set was delivered for testing in 1995, entering passenger service in March 1997. The entire fleet of nine sets was delivered by 1998. It was the first Shinkansen train in Japan to operate at a maximum speed of in regular passenger service. Besides the premium &quot;Nozomi&quot; services, 16-car trains were also used on &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; services during the busy holiday periods.

With the steady increase in the number of N700 Series Shinkansen since 2007, the 500 series were gradually retired from the &quot;Nozomi&quot; services. The last 500 series &quot;Nozomi&quot; run took place on 28 February 2010.

===Formation===
Cars 8 to 10 were &quot;Green&quot; (first class) cars. Cars 5 and 13 each had one &quot;T&quot;-style current collector.

===Interior===


==8-car V sets (500-7000 series)==

Eight of the original nine 500 series sets were modified and shortened to eight cars between 2008 and 2010, and were cascaded to Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; workings, replacing the earlier 0 series sets (V2 to V9). The first reformed eight-car set was unveiled to the press on 28 March 2008, and the trains entered service on twelve daily &quot;Kodama&quot; runs from 1 December 2008.

The maximum operating speed of these trains has been reduced to .

===Formation===
, the fleet consists of six eight-car sets (V2–V4, V7–V9) formed as follows, with car 1 at the Hakata end.

Cars 2 and 7 each have one single-arm pantograph.

===Interior===
Passenger accommodation consists of 3+2 abreast unidirectional seating, with 2+2 abreast seating in car 6 (former Green car). Between October and December 2013, cars 4 and 5 are also scheduled to have the original seating removed and replaced with new 2+2 abreast seating, the same as used in the &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; 700 series trainsets.

All passenger saloons on the 8-car 500 series trains are no-smoking, with new smoking compartments installed in cars 3 and 7. Cars 1, 3, 5, and 7 are equipped with toilets.

=== Future plans ===
In announcement made on 14 February 2024, JR West outlined plans to retire four of the six remaining 500 series sets from revenue service by the end of 2026. The plan is to shorten four existing 16-car N700 series sets into eight-car sets to replace the 500 series sets. On 24 July 2024, JR West announced plans to retire the last two 500 series sets by 2027.

==Special liveries==
=== 500 Type Eva ===
Since 7 November 2015, set V2 runs in a special &quot;500 Type Eva&quot; livery as part of the &quot;Shinkansen:Evangelion Project&quot; tie-up project to mark the 40th anniversary of the Sanyo Shinkansen and the 20th anniversary of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. Initially planned to operate until March 2017, this livery was extended until 13 May 2018. From 24 February until 7 May 2018, the 500 series car preserved at the Kyoto Railway Museum was exhibited in the &quot;500 Type Eva&quot; livery.

==== Interior ====
=== Hello Kitty ===
In March 2018, JR West announced the launch of a special &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; themed 500 series train on Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; services. The train entered service on 30 June 2018.

==Preserved examples==


As of 2023, two 500 Series cars have been preserved, both from the same set. Car 521–1, formerly the front car of set W1, is preserved at the Kyoto Railway Museum, which opened in April 2016. This car was exhibited in the &quot;500 Type Eva&quot; livery between 24 February and 7 May 2018.
Car 522–1, formerly the end car of set W1, is preserved at the Hitachi Rail Kasado factory in Kudamatsu, Yamaguchi, in Autumn 2015.

== In popular culture ==
The 500 Series Shinkansen served as basis for Liner Gao in Japanese mecha anime series &quot;The King of Braves GaoGaiGar&quot;.

The &quot;Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion&quot; franchise would feature the 500 series as one of its many titular mecha. In addition to the standard livery, the &quot;Evangelion&quot; and &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;-wrapped versions also appeared in both the toyline and anime.

The anime features the Autobot character Railspike, who transforms into a 500 Series Shinkansen.

<doc id="321610" wikidata="Q582205" url="?curid=321610" title="Northumberland National Park">
<text>Northumberland National Park is the northernmost national park in England. It covers an area of more than between the Scottish border in the north to just south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The park lies entirely within Northumberland, covering about a quarter of the county.

Of the thirteen National Parks in England and Wales, Northumberland is the most remote from large urban areas, the least populated, and the least visited.

The park covers several distinct areas. In the north are the Cheviot Hills, a range of hills that mark the border between England and Scotland. Further south, the hills give way to areas of rolling moorland, some of which have been covered by forestry plantations to form Kielder Forest. The southernmost part of the park covers the dramatic central section of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, dating from the Roman occupation.

The 10,000-year history of human habitation of the region is explored through the many archaeological sites, ranging from prehistoric monuments and Roman remains to Pele towers, constructed as a defence against invading Scots and Border Reivers.

The Park&#x27;s official symbol is the curlew.


==Etymology==
The Northumberland National Park takes its name from the English county of Northumberland. Northumberland means &quot;country north of the River Humber&quot; and is related to the name &quot;Northumbria&quot;, referring to the former Anglo-Saxon kingdom which once covered much of Northern England. The national park lies totally within the boundaries of Northumberland.

==Geography==
The Northumberland National Park covers a large area of Western Northumberland and borders the English county of Cumbria and the Scottish council area of The Scottish Borders. The national park encompasses much of the Cheviot Hills and adjoins the Southern Uplands of Scotland, which the hills are sometimes considered a part of. Since the Pennine Way runs through the national park, the Cheviot Hills are also considered a part of the northern Pennines although they are separated from the Cheviot Hills by the Tyne Gap, part of which lies within the southern extent of the national park. Part of Kielder Forest lies within the park, and in other areas forms a forest park. Kielder Forest is the largest man-made forest in Europe and surrounds Kielder Water.

==Otterburn Training Area==
The Ministry of Defence in the United Kingdom owns much of the land in the national park as the Otterburn Training Area. Some parts of this training area are off-limits; others can be accessed only at certain times or with permission. The training area accounts for 23% of the Northumberland National Park.

==Dark Sky Park status==
In December 2013 the International Dark Sky Association conferred Dark Sky Park status on an area including Northumberland National Park and Kielder; it is the largest protected Dark Sky Park in Europe.

<text>Carl Jonas Love Ludvig Almqvist (28 November 1793 – 26 September 1866) was a Swedish author, romantic poet, romantic critic of political economy, realist, composer and social critic.
==Biography==
Carl Jonas Love Almqvist was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of War Commissioner Karl Gustav Almqvist (1768–1846) and Birgitta Lovisa Gjörwell (1768–1806), daughter of journalist and editor Carl Christoffer Gjörwell Sr. (1731–1811). Almqvist&#x27;s younger half-brother was Director-General Gustavus Fridolf Almquist (1814–1886), who was the father of Agnes Hammarskjöld.

He studied at Uppsala University and then worked as a clerk in Stockholm. In 1823 he gave up his post, and in the autumn of the following year moved to Adolfsfors-Köla in northern Värmland where he and some friends, inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, intended to live out a rural idyll. It was there in 1824, that he married Anna Maria Andersdotter Lundström (1799–1868) and had two children. In 1828, he became a teacher at the experimental school Nya Elementar in Stockholm, where he was rector there from 1829 to 1841. Almqvist was ordained as a pastor in 1837, but could not find work, and after publishing &quot;Det går an&quot; in 1839 gave up that career altogether; supporting himself by working for various newspapers (including &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; and &quot; Jönköpingsbladet&quot;).

In June 1851 Almqvist fled Sweden on suspicion of fraud and poisoning attempts against an elderly usurer named Johan Jacob von Scheven, to whom he owed 18000 riksdaler. He arrived in the United States at the end of August and traveled widely under the name Lewis Gustawi. In Philadelphia, on the third anniversary of his departure from Stockholm, he bigamously married a 69-year-old guest-house proprietress, Emma Nugent. In 1865 Almqvist tried to return to Sweden, but only got as far as Bremen, where he lived under the name of E. Westerman and died in 1866.

He wrote many books and poems. Some dealt with his radical views on society and politics; in his novel &quot;Drottningens juvelsmycke&quot;, his main character, Tintomara, is neither male nor female, and arouses both men and women to fall in love, and in his novel &quot;Det går an&quot;, a woman lives with a man without being married to him. These books caused the church and state to condemn him and call him a dangerous revolutionary. However, he still maintained influence with his writings, and he is counted as one of the foremost Swedish social reformers of the 19th century.
==Works==

Many of his writings are included in the long series &quot;Törnrosens bok&quot; (1832–1851). Some of his musical compositions have been recorded.
* &quot;Parjumouf Saga ifrån Nya Holland&quot; (Stockholm, 1817), an early novel, published anonymously. It is the first Swedish novel set in Australia (which is termed Nya Holland, or New Holland, and also Ulimaroa)
* &quot;Amorina&quot; (1822, rev. 1839), novel
* &quot;Drottningens juvelsmycke&quot; (1834), novel.
** Translated as &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Diadem&quot; by Yvonne Sandstroem (1992)
* &quot;Ormus och Ariman&quot; (1839)
* &quot;Om poesi i sak&quot; (1839), essay on poetics
* &quot;Amorina eller historien om de fyra&quot; 1839
* &quot;Det går an&quot; (1838), novel. 
** Translated as &quot;Sara Videbeck and the Chapel&quot; by Adolph B. Benson (1919)
* &quot;Songes&quot; (1849), poetry.
* &quot;Svensk Språklara&quot; (1854)

===&quot;Sara Videbeck&quot;===
&quot;Sara Videbeck and the Chapel&quot; is the English translation of Almqvist&#x27;s most famous work, whose Swedish title is &quot;Det går an&quot;. In it, sergeant Albert falls in love with Sara Videbeck, a glazier&#x27;s daughter, during a steamboat trip between Stockholm and Lidköping. Sara is interested but outlines an egalitarian marriage without a formal wedding ceremony and without shared property. The novel ends with her asking, &quot;Will this all do, Albert?&quot; (&#x27;), and his answer, &quot;It will do&quot; (&#x27; ). The novel is primarily an attack on lifelong marriage as an institution and the inability of women to become financially independent. The book&#x27;s social tendency aroused lively debate and &quot;&quot;&quot; literature&quot; became a concept. (Fredrika Bremer&#x27;s contribution was the 1843 &quot;A Diary&quot;.) The controversy over the work, however, forced Almqvist out of his post as rector at the New Elementary School, Stockholm.

<doc id="321614" wikidata="Q1259963" url="?curid=321614" title="Supervised injection site">
<text>Supervised injection sites (SIS) or drug consumption rooms (DCRs) are a health and social response to drug-related problems. They are fixed or mobile spaces where people who use drugs are provided with sterile drug use equipment and can use illicit drugs under the supervision of trained staff. They are usually located in areas where there is an open drug scene and where injecting in public places is common. The primary target group for DCR services are people who engage in risky drug use.

The geographical distribution of DCRs is uneven, both at the international and regional levels. In 2022, there were over 100 DCRs operating globally, with services in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain, as well as in Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the USA. 

Primarily, DCRs aim to prevent drug-related overdose deaths, reduce the acute risks of disease transmission through unhygienic injecting, and connect people who use drugs with addiction treatment and other health and social services. They can also aim to minimise public nuisance. 

Proponents say they save lives and connect users to services, while opponents believe they promote drug use and attract crime to the community around the site. Supervised injection sites are part of a harm reduction approach towards drug problems.

==Terminology==
Supervised injection sites are also known as &quot;overdose prevention centers (OPCs)&quot;, &quot;supervised injection facilities&quot;, &quot;safe consumption rooms&quot;, &quot;safe injection sites&quot;, &quot;safe injection rooms&quot;, &quot;fix rooms&quot;, &quot;fixing rooms&quot;, &quot;safer injection facilities (SIF)&quot;, &quot;drug consumption facilities (DCF)&quot;, &quot;drug consumption rooms (DCRs)&quot;, &quot;medically supervised injecting centres (MSICs)&quot; and &quot;medically supervised injecting rooms (MSIRs)&quot;.

== Facilities ==
=== Australia ===

The legality of supervised injection is handled on a state-by state basis. New South Wales trialed a supervised injection site in Sydney in 2001, which was made permanent in 2010. After several years of community activism, Victoria agreed to open a supervised injection site in Melbourne&#x27;s North Richmond neighbourhood in 2018 on a trial basis. In 2020 the trial was extended for a further three years, and the site remains open as of 2024. 

A second site for Melbourne&#x27;s CBD was approved and was to be placed in a building on Flinders Street which had previously housed Yooralla. However, as of 2024, the site has been rejected by Premier Jacinta Allan who cited disagreements over location, preferring to set up a new community health and pharmacotherapy centre instead. 

=== Europe ===
During the 1990s legal facilities emerged in cities in Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. In the first decade of 2000, facilities opened in Spain, Luxembourg, and Norway.
Whereas injection facilities in Europe often evolved from something else, such as different social and medical outreaches or perhaps a homeless shelter, the degree and quality of actual supervision varies. The history of the European centers also mean that there have been no or little systematic collection of data needed to do a proper evaluation of effectiveness of the scheme. At the beginning of 2009 there were 92 facilities operating in 61 cities, including 30 cities in the Netherlands, 16 cities in Germany and 8 cities in Switzerland. Denmark passed a law allowing municipalities to run &quot;fix rooms&quot; in 2012, and by the end of 2013 there were three open.

To date in July 2022, according to European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction Belgium has one facility, Denmark five, France two, Germany 25, Greece one, Luxembourg two, Netherlands 25, Norway two, Portugal two, Spain 13, and Switzerland 14.

====Ireland====
Ireland has legislation to permit the opening of a service (as of May 2017) in the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017; however, it has been halted by planning concerns.

====Netherlands====
The first professionally staffed service where drug injection was accepted emerged in the Netherlands during the early 1970s as part of the &quot;alternative youth service&quot; provided by the St. Paul&#x27;s church in Rotterdam. At its peak it had two centers that combined an informal meeting place with a drop-in center providing basic health care, food and a laundering service. One of the centers was also a pioneer in providing needle-exchange. Its purpose was to improve the psychosocial function and health of its clients. The centers received some support from law enforcement and local government officials, although they were not officially sanctioned until 1996.
====Switzerland====
The first modern supervised consumption site was opened in Bern, Switzerland in June, 1986. Part of a project combatting HIV, the general concept of the café was a place where simple meals and beverages would be served, and information on safe sex, safe drug use, condoms and clean needles provided. Social workers providing counselling and referrals were also present. An injection room was not originally conceived, however, drug users began to use the facility for this purpose, and this soon became the most attractive aspect of the café. After discussions with the police and legislature, the café was turned into the first legally sanctioned drug consumption facility provided that no one under the age of 18 was admitted.

====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom opened one (officially unsanctioned) facility in Glasgow in September 2020. It was opened by Peter Krykant, a local drugs worker; however, lack of funding and support led to its closure in May 2021. In nine months of operation, 894 injection events were recorded at the facility and volunteers reported attending to nine overdose events, seven opioid overdoses, and two involving powder cocaine; but there were no fatalities.

In 2023, the Lord Advocate—Scotland&#x27;s chief legal officer—announced that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service would institute a policy of not criminally prosecuting those using approved supervised drug consumption sites. Police Scotland have also confirmed they will exercise discretion in not prosecuting those using such a facility. An official facility is planned to open in Glasgow in October, 2024. 

=== Latin America ===
The first site opened in Latin American was in Bogota, Colombia during October 2024.

===North America===
==== Canada ====

There are 39 government authorized SCS in Canada as of July 2019: 7 in Alberta, 9 in British Columbia, 19 in Ontario, and 4 in Quebec. An exemption to controlled substances law under Canadian Criminal Code is granted inside the facilities, but drug possession remains illegal outside the facility and there is no buffer zone around the facility. Canada&#x27;s first SCS, Insite in Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, commenced operation in 2003.

===== Alberta =====
In August 2020, ARCHES Lethbridge in Lethbridge, Alberta, the largest SCS in North America, closed shortly after Alberta revoked their grant for misuse of grant funds. Shortly after opening in February 2018, ARCHES Lethbridge found itself repetitively necessitating police intervention and/or emergency medical services for opioid-related issues; indeed, three weeks after its closure, the city noted a 36% decline in opioid-related EMS requests.
The average per-capita operating cost of government sanctioned sites are reported to be CAD$600 per unique-client, with the exception of the ARCHES Lethbridge which had a disproportionately high cost of CAD $3,200 per unique client.

In September 2020, a group in Lethbridge, Alberta led by an ARCHES employee started hosting an unauthorized SCS in public places in a tent. The group did not have authorizations to operate an SCS or a permit to pitch a tent in the park. The organizer was issued citations for the tent; and the Lethbridge Police Service advised that users utilizing the unauthorized SCS would be arrested for drug possession, because exemptions do not apply to unauthorized sites. This opening of this illegal drug consumption tent was controversial and became a subject of discussion at the City Council meeting.

===== Ontario =====
Ontario has scheduled to close ten drug SCS by end of March 2025 and further establishment of SCS is now banned.

==== United States ====

Clandestine injection sites have existed for years. A &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; study from July 2020 reports that an illegal supervised consumption site has been operating at an &quot;undisclosed&quot; city in the U.S. since 2014 where over 10,000 doses of illegal drugs have been injected over a five-year period. Supervised consumption sites with some degree of official sanction from a state or local government have been contemplated, but are rare due to the federal regulation of drugs and the explicit opposition of federal law enforcement to any form of decriminalization.

Local governments in Seattle, Boston, Vermont, Delaware, and Portland, Oregon have considered opening safe injection sites as well. Plans to open an injection site in Somerville, Massachusetts in 2020 were delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The governors of California and Vermont both vetoed supervised consumption site bills in 2022, and Pennsylvania&#x27;s Senate voted for a ban on them in 2023.

===== Denver (2018) =====
In November, 2018, Denver city council approved a pilot program for a safe injection site with a 12-to-1 vote. The Drug Enforcement Administration&#x27;s Denver field office and the United States Attorney&#x27;s office for the District of Colorado issued a statement together on the proposed site stating that &quot;the operation of such sites is illegal under federal law. 21 U.S.C. Sec. 856 prohibits the maintaining of any premises for the purpose of using any controlled substance.&quot;
===== New York City (2021) =====
The first government-authorized supervised injection sites in the US (operated by OnPoint NYC) began operating in New York City in November 2021.

A peer-reviewed study of the first two months of the OPC&#x27;s operation has been published in JAMA. 

Public criticism of the New York City OPC&#x27;s has so far been limited. One problem brought up by the leadership of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is how use migrates from the centers to nearby New York City Subway stations when the OPC&#x27;s are closed. In response Mayor Eric Adams called for the centers to be funded to operate continuously.

Though sanctioned by the city, the sites arguably remain illegal under federal law, and rely on non-enforcement by federal officials to keep operating. The United States Department of Justice, during the Presidency of Joe Biden, has signaled some openness and stated that it is &quot;evaluating supervised consumption sites, including discussions with state and local regulators about appropriate guardrails for such sites, as part of an overall approach to harm reduction and public safety.&quot;

===== Pennsylvania =====
An organization called Safehouse was hoping to open a safe consumption site in Philadelphia in February 2020 with the support of the city government. Immediate neighbors strongly objected to the site, and the owner of the first proposed location withdraw a lease offer under pressure. United States District Attorney William McSwain sued to stop the Safehouse project, losing in district court in October 2019, but winning an injunction in January 2021 from a 3-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Safehouse said its proposed operation was &quot;a legitimate medical intervention, not illicit drug dens&quot; and claimed protection under the Free Exercise Clause because &quot;religious beliefs compel them to save lives at the heart of one of the most devastating overdose crises in the country&quot;.

In May 2023, Pennsylvania senate passed a bill to ban supervised injection sites anywhere within the State of Pennsylvania with a 41-9 vote and it is pending house approval. The Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro expressed support for the bill.

===== San Francisco, California =====
For 11 months between January and December 2022, there had been drug addicts using within the center established by the health department. The center &quot;morphed&quot; from a social services linking service to a drug usage site.

=== Virtual overdose monitoring services / non physical site ===
Virtual overdose monitoring services are similar to safe consumption rooms. These programs use phone lines or smartphone apps to monitor clients while they use drugs, contacting emergency services if the caller becomes unresponsive. These services include the National Overdose Response Service in Canada and Never Use Alone in the US, as well as the smartphone apps Canary and Brave.

== Evaluations ==

In the late 1990s there were a number of studies available on consumption rooms in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. &quot;The reviews concluded that the rooms contributed to improved public and client health and reductions in public nuisance but stressed the limitations of the evidence and called for further and more comprehensive evaluation studies into the impact of such services.&quot; To that end, the two non-European injecting facilities, Australia&#x27;s Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) and Canada&#x27;s Vancouver Insite Supervised Injection Site have had more rigorous research designs as a part of their mandate to operate.

The NSW state government has provided extensive funding for ongoing evaluations of the Sydney MSIC, with a formal comprehensive evaluation produced in 2003, 18 months after the centre was opened. Other later evaluations studied various aspects of the operationservice provision (2005), community attitudes (2006), referral and client health (2007) and a fourth (2007) service operation and overdose related events. Other evaluations of drug-related crime in the area were completed in 2006, 2008 and 2010, the SAHA International cost-effectiveness evaluation in 2008 and a final independent KPMG evaluation in 2010.

The Vancouver Insite facility was evaluated during the first three years of its operation by researchers from the BC Center for Excellence in HIV/AIDS with published and some unpublished reports available. In March 2008 a final report was released that evaluated the performance of the Vancouver Insite against its stated objectives.

Some posit that safe injection sites help reduce improperly discarded needles in public. This was found to be the case in a report by the Canadian Mental Health Association in 2018. Prior to the establishment of a supervised injection site in Vesterbro, Copenhagen in Denmark in 2012, up to 10,000 syringes were found on its streets each week. Within a year of the supervised injection site opening this number fell to below 1,000.

There has been some attempt to standardise evaluation reporting across supervised injection sites in a type of Core outcome set with researchers from the United States funded by Drug Policy Alliance available; however, the intermediary process of how this consensus set was generated is unpublished.

The Expert Advisory Committee found that Insite had referred clients such that it had contributed to an increased use of detoxification services and increased engagement in treatment. Insite had encouraged users to seek counseling. Funding has been supplied by the Canadian government for detoxification rooms above Insite.

=== SIS sites and social disorder ===

A longitudinal studyUrban Social Issues Study (USIS)from January 2018 and February 2019undertaken by University of Lethbridge&#x27;s professor Em M. Pijl and commissioned by the City of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada explore &quot;any unintended consequences&quot; of supervised consumption services (SCS) within the &quot;surrounding community&quot;. The USIS study was undertaken in response to a drug crisis in Lethbridge that impacted &quot;many neighbourhoods in many different ways.&quot; Researchers studied the &quot;perceptions and observations of social disorder by business owners and operators&quot; in a neighborhood where SCS was introduced. The report cautioned, that drug abuse-related antisocial behavior in Lethbridge, in particular, and in cities, in general, has increased, as the &quot;quantity and type of drugs in circulation&quot; increases. As the use of crystal meth eclipses the use of opiates, users exhibit more &quot;erratic behavior&quot;. Crystal meth and other &quot;uppers&quot; also &quot;require more frequent use&quot; than &quot;downers&quot; like opiates. The report also notes that not all social disorder in communities that have a SCS, can be &quot;unequivocally and entirely attributed&quot; to the SCS, partly because of the &quot;ongoing drug epidemic.&quot; Other variables that explain increased anti-social behaviour includes an increase in the number of people aggregating outdoors as part of seasonal trends with warmer temperatures.

Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;WPVI-TV&quot; Action News team traveled to Toronto, Canada in 2018 to make first hand field observations of several safe consumption sites already in operation. A drug addict interviewed by the reporter said she visits the site to obtain supply, but did not stick around and used the supplies to shoot up drugs elsewhere and acknowledged the site attracts drug users and drug dealers. A neighbor interviewed by the reporter said there was drug use before, but he reports it has increased since the site opened.

WPVI-TV&#x27;s Chad Pradelli narrated the news team&#x27;s observation as: Over the two days we sat outside several of Toronto&#x27;s safe injection facilities, we witnessed prevalent drug use out front, drug deals, and even violence. We watched as one man harassed several people passing by on the sidewalk, even putting one in a chokehold. One guy decided to fight back and security arrived.

==== Sydney, Australia ====
The Sydney MSIC client survey conducted in 2005, found that public injecting (defined as injecting in a street, park, public toilet or car), which is a high risk practice with both health and public amenity impacts, was reported as the main alternative to injecting at the MSIC by 78% of clients. 49% of clients indicated resorting to public injection if the MSIC was not available on the day of registration with the MSIC. From this, the evaluators calculated a total 191,673 public injections averted by the centre.

==== Vancouver, Canada ====
Observations before and after the opening of the Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Insite facility indicated a reduction in public injecting. &quot;Self-reports&quot; of INSITE users and &quot;informal observations&quot; at INSITE, Sydney and some European SISs suggest that SISs &quot;can reduce rates of public self-injection.&quot;

==== Alberta, Canada ====
In response to the opioid epidemic in the province of Alberta, the Alberta Health Services&#x27;s (AHS), Alberta Health, Indigenous Relations, Justice and Solicitor General including the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta met to discuss potential solutions. In the November 2016 Alberta Health report that resulted from that meeting, the introduction of supervised consumption services, along with numerous other responses to the crisis, was listed as a viable solution. The 2016 Alberta Health report stated that, SIS, &quot;reduce overdose deaths, improve access to medical and social supports, and are not found to increase drug use and criminal activity.&quot;

According to January 2020 &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; editorial, by 2020 Alberta had seven SIS with a &quot;100-per-cent success rate at reversing the more than 4,300 overdoses&quot; that occurred from November 2017when the first SIS opened in the provinceuntil August 2019.

===== Calgary: Safeworks Supervised Consumption Services (SCS) =====
Safeworks was located at the Sheldon M. Chumir Health Centre, which operated for several months, as a temporary facility, became fully operational starting April 30, 2018 with services available 24 hours, 7 days a week. From the day it initially launched in October 30, 2017 to March 31, 2019, 71,096 people had used its services The staff &quot;responded to a total of 954 overdoses.&quot; In one month alone, &quot;848 unique individuals&quot; made 5,613 visits to the SCS. Its program is monitored by the Province of Alberta in partnership with the Institute of Health Economics.

In the City of Lethbridge&#x27;s commissioned 2020 102-page report, the author noted that &quot;Calgary&#x27;s Sheldon Chumir SCS has received considerable negative press about the &quot;rampant&quot; social disorder around the SCS, a neighbourhood that is mixed residential and commercial.&quot; According to a May 2019 &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; article, the 250 meter radius around the safe consumption site Safeworks in Calgary located within the Sheldon M. Chumir Centre has seen a major spike in crime since its opening and described in a report by the police as having become &quot;ground zero for drug, violent and property crimes in the downtown.&quot; Within this zone, statistics by the police in 2018 showed a call volume increase to the police by 276% for drug related matters 29% overall increase relative to the three-year average statistics. In May 2019, the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, said that Health Canada announced in February 2019 of approval for Siteworks to operate for another year, conditional to addressing neighborhood safety issues, drug debris and public disorder. There has been a plan for mobile safe consumption site intending to operate in the Forest Lawn, Calgary, Alberta, however in response to the statistics at the permanent site at the Sheldon M. Chumir Centre, community leaders have withdrawn their support.

By September 2019, the number of overdose treatment at Safeworks spiked. The staff were overwhelmed and 13.5% of their staff took psychological leave. They have had dealt with 134 overdose reversals in 2019 which was 300% more than the same time period from the previous year. The center&#x27;s director reported they&#x27;re dealing with an average of one overdose reversal every other day.

===== Lethbridge: ARCHES (Closed August 2020) =====
In response to the mounting death toll of drug overdose in Lethbridge, the city opened its first SCS in February, 2018. The controversial SCS, known as ARCHES was once the busiest SCS in North America.

The province defunded ARCHES after an audit ordered by government discovered misuse and mismanagement of public monies. Around 70% of ARCHES funding comes from the province, and it chose to shut it down on August 31, 2020 after the funding was revoked. The audit found “funding misappropriation, non-compliance with grant agreement [and] inappropriate governance and organizational operations.” The Alberta government requested that the site be investigated for possible criminal misuse of funds. Shortly afterwards, Lethbridge Police Service announced that the funds, which had previously been reported as missing, had been present and accounted for in bank accounts belonging to the SCS. Acting Inspector Pete Christos stated that the initial auditors did not have the means to determine whether money was missing, and confirmed that, during police interviews with Arches staff, all spent funds had been accounted for. Police Chief Shahin Mehdizadeh told reporters that the Alberta Justice Specialized Prosecutions Branch supported the police&#x27;s findings and were not recommending criminal charges.

The City of Lethbridge commissioned a report that included an Urban Social Issues Study (USIS) which examined unintended consequences of the SIS site in Lethbridge. The research found that in smaller cities, such as Lethbridge, that in communities with a SCS, social disorder may be more noticeable. The report&#x27;s author, University of Lethbridge&#x27;s Em M. Pijl, said that news media tended to the &quot;personal experiences of business owners and residents who work and/or live near an SCS&quot;, which contrasts with &quot;scholarly literature that demonstrates a lack of negative neighbourhood impacts related to SCSs.&quot;

=== Impact on community levels of overdose ===

Over a nine-year period the Sydney MSIC managed 3,426 overdose-related events with not one fatality while Vancouver’s Insite had managed 336 overdose events in 2007 with not a single fatality.

The 2010 MSIC evaluators found that over 9 years of operation it had made no discernible impact on heroin overdoses at the community level with no improvement in overdose presentations at hospital emergency wards.

Research by injecting room evaluators in 2007 presented statistical evidence that there had been later reductions in ambulance callouts during injecting room hours, but failed to make any mention of the introduction of sniffer dog policing, introduced to the drug hot-spots around the injecting room a year after it opened.

=== Site experience of overdose ===
While overdoses are managed on-site at Vancouver, Sydney and the facility near Madrid, German consumption rooms are forced to call an ambulance due to naloxone being administered only by doctors. A study of German consumption rooms indicated that an ambulance was called in 71% of emergencies and naloxone administered in 59% of cases. The facilities in Sydney and Frankfurt indicate 2.2-8.4% of emergencies resulting in hospitalization.

Vancouver’s Insite yielded 13 overdoses per 10,000 injections shortly after commencement, but in 2009 had more than doubled to 27 per 10,000. The Sydney MSIC recorded 96 overdoses per 10,000 injections for those using heroin. Commenting on the high overdose rates in the Sydney MSIC, the evaluators suggested that,
: “In this study of the Sydney injecting room there were 9.2 (sic) heroin overdoses per 1000 heroin injections in the centre. This rate of overdose is higher than amongst heroin injectors generally. The injecting room clients seem to have been a high-risk group with a higher rate of heroin injections than others not using the injection room facilities. They were more often injecting on the streets and they appear to have taken greater risks and used more heroin whilst in the injecting room.

===People living with HIV/AIDS===
The results of a research project undertaken at the Dr. Peter Centre (DPC), a 24-bed residential HIV/AIDS care facility located in Vancouver, were published in the Journal of the International AIDS Society in March 2014, stating that the provision of supervised injection services at the facility improved health outcomes for DPC residents. The DPC considers the incorporation of such services as central to a &quot;comprehensive harm reduction strategy&quot; and the research team concluded, through interviews with 13 residents, that &quot;the harm reduction policy altered the structural-environmental context of healthcare services and thus mediated access to palliative and supportive care services&quot;, in addition to creating a setting in which drug use could be discussed honestly. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medication adherence and survival are cited as two improved health outcomes.

=== Crime ===

The Sydney MSIC was judged by its evaluators to have caused no increase in crime and not to have caused a ‘honey-pot effect’ of drawing users and drug dealers to the Kings Cross area.

Observations before and after the opening of Insite indicated no increases in drug dealing or petty crime in the area. There was no evidence that the facility influenced drug use in the community, but concerns that Insite ‘sends the wrong message’ to non-users could not be addressed from existing data. The European experience has been mixed.

==== Financial impropriety by SCS service providers ====
An audit of Lethbridge ARCHES SCS by accounting firm Deloitte, ordered by the Alberta provincial government, found the SCS had $1.6 million in unaccounted funds between 2017 and 2018; additionally they found that led $342,943 of grant funds had been expended on senior executive compensation despite the grant agreement allowing only $80,000. Beyond this, an additional $13,000 was spent on parties, staff retreats, entertainment and gift cards, and numerous other inappropriate expenditures.

The Lethbridge Police Service and Alberta Justice Specialized Prosecutions Branch later contradicted these findings, stating that all funds were present and accounted for in accounts belonging to the agency. When asked why these funds had previously been reported as missing, LPS Acting Inspector Pete Christos stated that the initial auditors did not have the means to investigate the agency&#x27;s finances, and that all spending had been accounted for during the criminal probe.

Premier Jason Kenney did not dispute the results of the investigation, but declined to reinstate funding, claiming that the site&#x27;s management had lost the confidence of his government.

=== Community perception ===

The Expert Advisory Committee for Vancouver’s Insite found that health professionals, local police, the local community and the general public have positive or neutral views of the service, with opposition decreasing over time.

=== Predicted cost effectiveness ===

The cost of running Insite per annum is CA$3 million. Mathematical modeling showed cost to benefit ratios of one dollar spent ranging from 1.5 to 4.02 in benefit. However, the Expert Advisory Committee expressed reservation about the certainty of Insite’s cost effectiveness until proper longitudinal studies had been undertaken. Mathematical models for HIV transmissions foregone had not been locally validated and mathematical modeling from lives saved by the facility had not been validated.

<doc id="321617" wikidata="Q6557901" url="?curid=321617" title="Lisa Crystal Carver">
<text>Lisa Crystal Carver (born November 9, 1968, Dover, New Hampshire), also known as Lisa Suckdog, is an American writer known for her writing in &quot;Rollerderby&quot;. Through her interviews, she introduced the work of Vaginal Davis, Dame Darcy, Cindy Dall, Boyd Rice, Costes (her ex-husband with whom she performed as Suckdog), Nick Zedd, GG Allin, and Liz Armstrong to the public. A collection of notable articles from the zine was published as &quot;Rollerderby: The Book&quot;.

She started touring with the performance art band Psycodrama when she was 18 years old. It was also at this time that she began doing sex work, which has been a major theme in her writings over the years. She began touring with Costes a year later, and would also tour without him when he was in France. She toured the U.S. and Europe six times, the last time in 1998. The noise music soap operas included audience interaction including dancing and mock-rape of audience members.

Carver is also the author of &quot;Dancing Queen: a Lusty Look at the American Dream&quot;, in which she expounds upon various relics of pop culture past, including Lawrence Welk, roller rinks, and Olivia Newton-John. In 2005, Soft Skull Press released &quot;Drugs Are Nice&quot;, detailing her early childhood and later romantic relationships with Costes, Boyd Rice (with whom she has a son) and Smog&#x27;s Bill Callahan. In addition to writing her own zines and books, Carver has also written for various magazines (including Peter Bagge&#x27;s comic book &quot;Hate&quot;) and kept a fictionalized journal about her sex life for the website Nerve. Although Carver no longer writes her journal for the site, she is still a semi-regular contributor. The online journal at Nerve was subsequently published in book form as &quot;The Lisa Diaries: Four Years in the Sex Life of Lisa Carver and Company.&quot;

2012 saw the release of Carver&#x27;s treatise on the artistic career of Yoko Ono titled &quot;Reaching Out with No Hands: Reconsidering Yoko Ono&quot; (Backbeat Books). As of 2015, Carver has written a handful of pieces for website The Recoup. Her book, &quot;The Jaywalker&quot;, is a short story collection illustrated by long-time friend and collaborator Dame Darcy. Lisa, Dame Darcy, Maddie Kuzak, and Genevieve Kuzak toured parts of the world in 2016 to promote the book—a performance art show reminiscent of the early 1990s Suckdog.

She also interviewed mixed martial arts fighter Brent Bergeron for an article that appeared in &quot;Vice&quot; magazine.

In 2017, Carver released &quot;Suckdog: A Ruckus&quot; (self published). This book, including 80+ photos and illustrations, looks back at Carver&#x27;s wild past onstage and behind-the-scenes.

In 2023, she published an essay in The Paris Review contrasting French and American culture and discussing her relationship with her husband Bruno.

In her personal life, she has &quot;been married four times and divorced three,&quot;, and lives in Montmorency, France.

<doc id="321623" wikidata="Q607807" url="?curid=321623" title="Slim Dusty">
<text>Slim Dusty, AO MBE (born David Gordon Kirkpatrick; 13 June 1927 – 19 September 2003) was an Australian country music singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer. He was an Australian cultural icon, referred to universally as Australia&#x27;s King of Country Music and one of the country&#x27;s most awarded stars, with a career spanning nearly seven decades and producing numerous recordings. He was known to record songs in the legacy of Australia genre, particularly of bush life, including works by renowned Australian bush poets Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, who represented the lifestyle. The music genre was coined the &quot;bush ballad&quot;, a style first made popular by Buddy Williams. Dusty was also known for his many trucking songs.

Slim Dusty &quot;released more than a hundred albums, selling more than seven million records and earning over 70 gold and platinum album certifications&quot;. He was the first Australian to have a No. 1 international hit song, with a version of Gordon Parsons&#x27; &quot;A Pub with No Beer&quot;. He received 38 Golden Guitars and an Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) award. He was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and Australian Roll of Renown. At the time of his death, age 76, Dusty had been working on his 106th album for EMI Records. In 2007, his domestic record sales in Australia surpassed seven million. During his lifetime, Dusty was considered an Australian National Treasure. He performed &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, a very famous song in Australia, at the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.

==Family and career==
===Childhood and early career===
David Gordon Kirkpatrick was born on 13 June 1927 in Nulla Nulla Creek west of Kempsey, New South Wales, the son of a cattle farmer. His childhood home, &quot;Homewood&quot;, survives and is now heritage-listed. He was known by his middle name, Gordon. He wrote his first song, &quot;The Way the Cowboy Dies&quot;, in 1937 and adopted the stage name &quot;Slim Dusty&quot; in 1938 at age 11. His earliest musical influences included American Jimmie Rodgers, New Zealander Tex Morton, and Australia&#x27;s Buddy Williams. In 1945, Dusty wrote &quot;When the Rain Tumbles Down in July&quot; and released his first record that year at age 18. In 1946, he signed his first recording contract with Columbia Graphophone for the Regal Zonophone label.

===Influential wife, and children===

In 1951, Dusty married singer-songwriter Joy McKean and, with her help, achieved great success around Australia. In 1954, the two launched a full-time business career, including the Slim Dusty Travelling Show. McKean was Dusty&#x27;s wife and manager for over 50 years. 

McKean&#x27;s sister Heather, half of the McKean Sisters music duo that preceded Joy&#x27;s association with Dusty, was married to Australian country singer Reg Lindsay, before separating and later divorcing in the 1980s, whereupon the McKean sisters re-started their music duo.

Together Dusty and Joy McKean had two children, Anne Kirkpatrick and David Kirkpatrick, who are also accomplished singer-songwriters.

===Dusty hits written by Joy McKean===
McKean wrote several of Dusty&#x27;s most popular songs, including &quot;Lights On The Hill&quot;, &quot;Walk a Country Mile&quot;, &quot;Indian Pacific&quot;, &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Offsider&quot;, &quot;The Angel of Goulburn Hill&quot; and &quot;The Biggest Disappointment&quot;.

===Other songwriters&#x27; contributions===
Although himself an accomplished writer of songs, Dusty had a number of other songwriters, including Mack Cormack, Gordon Parsons, Stan Coster, and Kelly Dixon, who were typically short on formal education but big on personal experience of the Australian bush. Drawing on his travels and such writers over a span of decades, Dusty chronicled the story of a rapidly changing postwar Australian nation.

===First megahit===
Dusty&#x27;s 1957 hit &quot;A Pub with No Beer&quot; was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go gold and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc. (The &quot;Pub with No Beer&quot; is a real place, in Taylors Arm, not far from Kempsey, where Slim was born.) In 1959 and 1960, Dutch and German cover versions of the song became number one hits (even evergreens) in Belgium, Austria and Germany, brought by the Flemish country singer-guitarist and amusement park founder Bobbejaan Schoepen.
In 1964 the annual Slim Dusty Australia-round tour, a journey that went on for ten months, was started. This regular event was the subject of a feature film, &quot;The Slim Dusty Movie&quot;, in 1984.

===Contributions of other songwriters===
Dusty recorded not only songs written by himself and other fellow Australian performers but also classic Australian poems by Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, with new tunes to call attention to the old &quot;bush ballads&quot;. An example is &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; by Paterson. The 1980 album and songs &quot;The Man Who Steadies the Lead&quot; and &quot;The Pearl of Them All&quot; were the works of Paterson&#x27;s rival for the title of Australia&#x27;s bush balladeer, Scottish-Australian poet Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963). In 1970, Dusty was made a member of the Order of the British Empire for services to music.

==Awards and honors==
In 1973, Dusty won Best Single at the inaugural Country Music Awards of Australia at the Tamworth Country Music Festival (McKean won Song of the Year as writer of &quot;Lights on the Hill&quot;). By March 1976, Dusty had achieved 37 gold and two platinum records, more than any other Australian artist.

Dusty and his wife were patrons of the National Truck Drivers&#x27; Memorial, located in Tarcutta, New South Wales.

The general manager of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, Bob Whitaker, invited Dusty and his wife to perform in 1997, recognising 50 years of contributing to country music. 

The following January, Dusty was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for his service to the entertainment industry.

Dusty recorded and released his 100th album, &quot;Looking Forward, Looking Back&quot;, in 2000 and became the first artist in worldwide commercial recording history to do so; second was Cliff Richard. All 100 albums were recorded with the same record label, EMI, making Dusty the first music artist in the world to record 100 albums with the same label. 

Dusty was appointed to sing &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics; the whole stadium (officially 114,714 in attendance, the largest in Olympic history) sang along with him.

===ARIA Music Awards (ARIA)===
The Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards (commonly known informally as ARIA Music Awards or ARIA Awards) is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the Australian music industry, put on by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).
Slim Dusty has won one award from 10 nominations. 
Additionally, Dusty was awarded two achievement awards and inducted into the Hall of Fame.

==Country gospel music interest==
Dusty&#x27;s repertoire included country gospel music, with which he liked to finish his shows. His live albums usually carried the theme, and in 1971 he released the Gospel album &quot;Glory Bound Train&quot; featuring the eponymous hit &quot;Glory Bound Train&quot; and other songs of a Christian theme. &quot;Glory Bound Train&quot; was in turn the song selected to conclude the tribute concert held at Tamworth after his death. The &quot;Concert for Slim&quot; was recorded live on 20 January 2004, at the Tamworth Regional Entertainment Centre, and an all-star cast of Australian musicians sang out the show with Slim&#x27;s &quot;Glory Bound Train&quot;. The DVD was certified 3× Platinum in Australia.

==Death==
He died at his home in St Ives, New South Wales, on 19 September 2003 at the age of 76 after a protracted battle with Colorectal cancer.

Eminent figures, including the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, and the federal opposition leader, Simon Crean, attended a state funeral at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney on 26 September 2003, where thousands had gathered. In the funeral, the Anglican Dean of Sydney, Phillip Jensen paid tribute by leading the congregation of family, statesmen, fans and musicians in the singing of &quot;A Pub With No Beer&quot;. Several tributes were featured from Dusty&#x27;s children as well as words from other national musicians (Peter Garrett and John Williamson) and music from Graeme Connors, Kasey Chambers and Troy Cassar-Daley. Around Australia, thousands of fans gathered to stand outside the cathedral; Dusty was later cremated.

Dusty had been working on his 106th album for EMI at the time of his death. On 8 March 2004 the album, &quot;Columbia Lane – the Last Sessions&quot;, debuted at number five on the Australian album charts and number one on the country charts. Gold status was achieved after being on sale for less than two weeks.

&quot;Columbia Lane&quot; is a tribute to the laneway juxtaposed to Parramatta Road in Strathfield (near the railway bridge link), where the EMI studios once stood (now a Kennards Self Storage store), and where he began his music career.

In 2004, Tamworth hosted the &quot;Concert for Slim&quot; as a memorial tribute featuring more than 30 Australian musical artists including Joy McKean, Paul Kelly, Keith Urban, Lee Kernaghan and Kasey Chambers.

In 2005, in tribute to the iconic song &quot;Cunnamulla Fella&quot; performed by Dusty with lyrics by Stan Coster, an eponymous statue was unveiled in the Queensland town of Cunnamulla.

EMI Records&#x27; Australian sales of Dusty&#x27;s records surpassed seven million in 2007.

<doc id="321624" wikidata="Q927319" url="?curid=321624" title="700 Series Shinkansen">
<text>The is a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed train type built between 1997 and 2006, and entering service in 1999. Originally designated as &quot;N300&quot; during the development phase, they formed the next generation of Shinkansen vehicles jointly designed by JR Central and JR-West for use on the Tokaido Shinkansen, Hakata Minami Line and the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen. Though it has since been withdrawn from service on the Tokaido Shinkansen, it continues to operate on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen and Hakata Minami Line.

==Design==
The 700 series is characterized by its flat &#x27;duck-bill&#x27; nose designed to reduce the piston effect as the trains enter tunnels. 16-car units are painted white with blue stripes beneath the windows, and are used for &quot;Nozomi&quot;, &quot;Hikari&quot;, and &quot;Kodama&quot; services on the Tokaido and San&#x27;yō Shinkansen lines, while 8-car units used for the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; services have a darker livery (grey with black window areas and a yellow stripe beneath the windows) which also acts to visually deemphasize the units&#x27; nose area, resulting in a more streamlined impression.

As with the 500 series trains, yaw dampers are fitted between vehicles, and all cars feature semi-active suspension to ensure smooth ride characteristics at high speed. Compared with the small fleet of high-performance, high-cost 500 series trains built for JR-West, these trains were designed to give improved ride comfort and interior ambience over the earlier 300 series trains at a lower cost than the 500 series trains. The cost of a 16-car 700 series unit is approximately 4 billion yen compared with around 5 billion yen for a 16-car 500 series train.
==Operations==
700 series trainsets were scheduled to be withdrawn from Tokaido Shinkansen services by the end of fiscal 2019. The last 700 series Tokaido Shinkansen run took place on 1 March 2020. However, the 700 series still operates on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen.

==Variants==
* 700-9000 series: 16-car pre-series set
* 700-0 series: 16-car &quot;C&quot; sets owned by JR Central, introduced from March 1999. Retired from service on 28 February 2020. ( Originally scheduled to be 8 March 2020)
* 700-3000 series: 16-car &quot;B&quot; sets owned by JR-West, introduced from 2001. Retired from service in August 2020.
* 700-7000 series: 8-car &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; &quot;E&quot; sets owned by JR-West, introduced from 11 March 2000

==Pre-series unit (700-9000 series)==
The pre-series set, C0, was delivered in October 1997, and underwent endurance running mainly between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka until early 1999, including a short period of testing as an 8-car formation on the Sanyo Shinkansen. New single-arm current collectors were fitted from the start, and these initially featured the distinctive &quot;wine-glass&quot; pantograph shrouds of the 300X train. These were later changed to a design resembling the 500 series arrangement with additional side fences, which was used on the subsequent production trains. Unit C0 was modified to full production standard in September 1999 and renumbered as C1, and was officially withdrawn in January 2013.

==16-car C sets==

These units were ordered by JR Central for use on Tokyo to Hakata &quot;Nozomi&quot; services, displacing the 300 series trains previously used on these services. Interior layout and accommodation is similar to that of the 300 series trains, with three Green class (first class) vehicles, and the same seat pitch in standard class, and in Green class. The central gangways were widened by to , and ceilings were raised by to . The refreshment counters of the 300 and 500 series trains were discontinued and replaced by vending machines selling drinks, located in cars 3, 7, 11, and 15.

Specifications permit running on the Sanyo Shinkansen with speed restricted to on the Tokaido Shinkansen between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka. The initial batch ordered by JR Central consisted of 17 units, with the first 4 units delivered in time for introduction on three daily return &quot;Nozomi&quot; services from March 1999. Services featuring 700 series stock were increased to five daily from July 1999, and further increased from October 1999. With continuing deliveries, 700 series trains were also introduced on Tōkaidō Shinkansen &quot;Hikari&quot; services from late 2000.

Set numbers C25 onwards introduced from May 2001 incorporate minor interior design improvements, including power outlets at the ends of cars for PC users, and hand-grabs on the edge of aisle seats. An order for an additional batch of six units was placed by JR Central in December 2003, with delivery scheduled for the end of 2004. These sets (C55 to C60) provided additional capacity for services connected with the Aichi Expo in 2005.
Before entering passenger service, JR Central set C46 was used on a series of test runs from late January 2003 fitted with streamlined bogie covers on all cars and flush diaphragm covers between cars 16/15 and 15/14. These modifications were removed before the unit entered revenue service. Flush diaphragm covers were used on future trains, such as the N700 series.

Between October 2008 and June 2009, JR Central&#x27;s fleet of 60 700 series sets underwent modifications to increase the acceleration from the original on the Tokaido Shinkansen to improve timetable planning flexibility.

During fiscal 2011, eight JR Central &quot;C&quot; sets (C11 to C18) were transferred to JR-West to replace its fleet of nine 300 series sets scheduled to be withdrawn by spring 2012.

Withdrawals of 700 series sets began in July 2011 with the withdrawal of set C4. It continued in 2013 (sets C1, C2, C3, C5 - C8) and in 2014 (C9, C10, C20 - C24).

The remaining 700 series sets were removed from regularly scheduled Tokaido Shinkansen services from 1 December 2019. The last Tokaido Shinkansen 700 series run from Tokyo to Shin-Osaka had been scheduled to take place on 8 March 2020, but was cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Japan. This cancellation resulted in the last 700 series Tokaido Shinkansen run taking place a week earlier on 1 March 2020.

===Formation===
The 16-car C sets are formed as follows, with car 1 at the Hakata (west) end.
Cars 5 and 12 each have one single-arm pantograph.

===Interior===
==16-car B sets (700-3000 series)==

These are the units owned by JR-West for use on through &quot;Hikari&quot; services from Tokyo, displacing the 100 series V &quot;Grand Hikari&quot; stock previously used on these services. With the timetable revision following the opening of Shinagawa Station in October 2003, the number of Nozomi trains increased significantly, and they were also used for the Nozomi service. A total of 15 units were delivered from June 2001 to January 2006. These trains use the same bogies as the JR-West 500 series sets. Other differences include LED destination indicator panels, white pantograph side fences, &quot;JR 700&quot; logos on the cab sides, and also different seat designs.

The 16-car B sets are formed as follows, with car 1 at the Hakata (west) end.
Cars 5 and 12 each have one single-arm pantograph.

===Interior===
==8-car E sets (700-7000 series)==
8-car E units were introduced by JR-West for use on new limited-stop Sanyo Shinkansen &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; services between Shin-Osaka and Hakata from 11 March 2000, replacing the former 0 series &quot;West Hikari&quot; services. The first units were delivered at the beginning of December 1999, with a total of 16 units built. Externally, these units differ noticeably from their JR Central sisters in having a variation of the 500 series livery with the blue waistline band replaced by a band of &quot;sunny yellow&quot;. &quot;Rail Star&quot; logos are applied to the sides of alternate cars as well as on the cab sides. Each 8-car train has two single-arm pantographs of a similar design to the JR Central 16-car sets. It was originally planned that sets would be able to operate coupled together, enabling 16-car formations to be run in busy periods, but this feature has never been utilized. With the discontinuation of &quot;Hikari&quot; services running solely on the San&#x27;yo Shinkansen, replaced by &quot;Sakura&quot; services from 2011, these sets are primarily used on &quot;Kodama&quot; services between Shin-Osaka and Hakata.

===Formation===
The 8-car E sets are formed as follows, with car 1 at the Hakata (west) end).
Cars 2 and 7 each have one single-arm pantograph.

===Interior===
The trains feature four 4-seat compartments in car 8, and the seats at the ends of each car have power supply outlets for mobile PC users. Unlike the 0 series SK sets which they replaced, these sets are completely monoclass without Green class accommodation. However, the five reserved standard class cars, cars 4 to 8, have club class style 2+2 abreast seating compared to the normal 2+3 seating arrangement in the non-reserved cars. Seat pitch is throughout. Car 4 was also designated as a &quot;Silence car&quot;, in which onboard announcements were omitted, but this was discontinued from March 2011.

==Fleet history==
The annual totals for the fleet sizes (number of vehicles as of 1 April each year) owned by JR Central and JR West are as follows.


==Derivatives==
Two Class 923 &quot;Doctor Yellow&quot; trains based on the 700 series design are used for track and overhead wire diagnostic work on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines. Both the 800 series and Taiwan High Speed 700T were directly developed from the 700 series. The N700 series and N700S series are also developed from the 700 series.
==Accidents and incidents==
* On June 14, 2018, the &quot;Nozomi&quot; Superexpress No. 176, operated by 16-car JR West 700 series set B8, collided with a man trespassing on the tracks between Hakata Station and Kokura Station on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen, killing the trespasser instantly and dismembering their body from the impact force. The lead power car sustained substantial damage to its nose. The driver of the train reported hearing an unusual sound at the time of the collision, but continued onward, believing that he had hit an animal and that the incident was too minor to immediately report. The driver of another bullet train service noticed the damage to the train after it had stopped at Kokura, reporting the train&#x27;s condition to the operation center, but the train continued on its route eastward, departing from the station as normal shortly afterwards. The driver of Superexpress No. 176 was contacted, and the train was brought to a stop and taken out of service for inspection at Shin-Shimonoseki Station in Yamaguchi Prefecture. A visual investigation of the power car found bloodstains on its front, as well as human remains that had been forced inside the damaged area from the force of the collision. Additional remains of the trespasser were found in the vicinity of the Ishisaka tunnel in Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu. Following the incident, JR West reiterated its policy that drivers of bullet trains were to immediately bring the train to a stop and contact the operation center upon the occurrence of any unusual noises, regardless of how severe they believed the cause to be.

<text>Cyclooxygenase (COX), officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS), is an enzyme (specifically, a family of isozymes, ) that is responsible for biosynthesis of prostanoids, including thromboxane and prostaglandins such as prostacyclin, from arachidonic acid. A member of the animal-type heme peroxidase family, it is also known as prostaglandin G/H synthase. The specific reaction catalyzed is the conversion from arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 via a short-living prostaglandin G2 intermediate.

Pharmaceutical inhibition of COX can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, exert their effects through inhibition of COX. Those that are specific to the COX-2 isozyme are called COX-2 inhibitors. The active metabolite (AM404) of paracetamol is a COX inhibitor, a fact to which some or all of its therapeutic effect has been attributed.

In medicine, the root symbol &quot;COX&quot; is encountered more often than &quot;PTGS&quot;. In genetics, &quot;PTGS&quot; is officially used for this family of genes and proteins because the root symbol &quot;COX&quot; was already used for the cytochrome c oxidase family. Thus, the two isozymes found in humans, PTGS1 and PTGS2, are frequently called COX-1 and COX-2 in medical literature. The names &quot;prostaglandin synthase (PHS)&quot;, &quot;prostaglandin synthetase (PHS)&quot;, and &quot;prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthetase (PES)&quot; are older terms still sometimes used to refer to COX.

== Biology ==
In terms of their molecular biology, COX-1 and COX-2 are of similar molecular weight, approximately 70 and 72 kDa, respectively, and having 65% amino acid sequence homology and near-identical catalytic sites. Both proteins have three domains: an N-terminal EGF-like domain, a small 4-helical membrane anchor, and a core heme-peroxidase catalytic domain. Both form dimers. The membrane anchor fixes the proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and microsome membrane.

== Pharmacology ==

COX is a common target for anti-inflammatory drugs. The most significant difference between the isoenzymes, which allows for selective inhibition, is the substitution of isoleucine at position 523 in COX-1 with valine in COX-2. The smaller Val523 residue in COX-2 allows access to a hydrophobic side-pocket in the enzyme (which Ile523 sterically hinders). Drug molecules, such as DuP-697 and the coxibs derived from it, bind to this alternative site and are considered to be selective inhibitors of COX-2.

=== Classical NSAIDs ===
The main COX inhibitors are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The classical COX inhibitors are not selective and inhibit all types of COX. The resulting inhibition of prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis has the effect of reduced inflammation, as well as antipyretic, antithrombotic and analgesic effects. The most frequent adverse effect of NSAIDs is irritation of the gastric mucosa as prostaglandins normally have a protective role in the gastrointestinal tract. Some NSAIDs are also acidic which may cause additional damage to the gastrointestinal tract.

=== Newer NSAIDs ===
Selectivity for COX-2 is the main feature of celecoxib, etoricoxib, and other members of this drug class. Because COX-2 is usually specific to inflamed tissue, there is much less gastric irritation associated with COX-2 inhibitors, with a decreased risk of peptic ulceration. The selectivity of COX-2 does not seem to negate other side-effects of NSAIDs, most notably an increased risk of kidney failure, and there is evidence that indicates an increase in the risk of heart attack, thrombosis, and stroke through an increase of thromboxane unbalanced by prostacyclin (which is reduced by COX-2 inhibition). Rofecoxib (brand name Vioxx) was withdrawn in 2004 because of such concerns. Some other COX-2 selective NSAIDs, such as celecoxib, and etoricoxib, are still on the market.

=== Natural COX inhibition ===
Culinary mushrooms, like maitake, may be able to partially inhibit COX-1 and COX-2.

A variety of flavonoids have been found to inhibit COX-2.

Fish oils provide alternative fatty acids to arachidonic acid. These acids can be turned into some anti-inflammatory prostacyclins by COX instead of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins.

Hyperforin has been shown to inhibit COX-1 around 3-18 times as much as aspirin.

Calcitriol (vitamin D) significantly inhibits the expression of the COX-2 gene.

Caution should be exercised in combining low dose aspirin with COX-2 inhibitors due to potential increased damage to the gastric mucosa. COX-2 is upregulated when COX-1 is suppressed with aspirin, which is thought to be important in enhancing mucosal defense mechanisms and lessening the erosion by aspirin.

=== Cardiovascular side-effects of COX inhibitors ===

COX-2 inhibitors have been found to increase the risk of atherothrombosis even with short-term use. A 2006 analysis of 138 randomised trials and almost 150,000 participants showed that selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with a moderately increased risk of vascular events, mainly due to a twofold increased risk of myocardial infarction, and also that high-dose regimens of some traditional NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen, but not naproxen) are associated with a similar increase in risk of vascular events.

This evidence, however, has been contradicted by the 2016 PRECISION (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen or Naproxen) trial of 24,081 participants, which shows a lower incidence of cardiovascular death (including hemorrhagic death), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke for Celecoxib as compared to both Naproxen and Ibuprofen.

Fish oils (e.g., cod liver oil) have been proposed as a reasonable alternative for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions as a consequence of the fact that they provide less cardiovascular risk than other treatments including NSAIDs.

=== Effects of COX on the immune system ===
Inhibition of COX-2 using celecoxib has been shown to reduce the immunosuppressive TGFβ expression in hepatocytes attenuating EMT in human hepatocellular carcinoma

<doc id="321630" wikidata="Q567982" url="?curid=321630" title="E1 Series Shinkansen">
<text>The was a high-speed Shinkansen train type operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Japan from July 1994 until September 2012. They were the first double-deck trains built for Japan&#x27;s Shinkansen. They were generally, along with their fellow double-deck class the E4 series, known by the marketing name &quot;Max&quot; (Multi-Amenity eXpress). The fleet was withdrawn from regular service on 28 September 2012.

Originally intended to be classified as 600 series, the E1 series trains were introduced specifically to relieve overcrowding on services used by commuters on the Tohoku Shinkansen and Joetsu Shinkansen.

==Operations==
E1 series sets were used on the following services.

* Joetsu Shinkansen 
** &quot;Max Asahi&quot; (July 1994 – November 2002)
** &quot;Max Tanigawa&quot; (until September 2012)
** &quot;Max Toki&quot; (until 28 September 2012)
* Tohoku Shinkansen
** &quot;Max Nasuno&quot; (until December 1999)
**&quot;Max Yamabiko&quot; (July 1994 – December 1999)

==Interior==
The E1 series was the first revenue-earning shinkansen to feature 3+3 abreast seating in standard class for increased seating capacity. The upper deck saloons of non-reserved cars 1 to 4 were arranged 3+3 with no individual armrests, and did not recline. The lower decks of these cars, and the reserved-seating saloons in cars 5 to 12 had regular 2+3 seating. The Green car saloons on the upper decks of cars 9 to 11 had 2+2 seating. The trains had a total seating capacity of 1,235 passengers.

===Pre-refurbishment===
===Post-refurbishment===

==Formation==
The fleet of 12-car sets, numbered M1 to M6, were formed as follows, with car 1 at the Tokyo end.
Cars 6 and 10 were each equipped with a PS201 scissors-type pantograph.

==Fleet details==
(Sources:)

==History==

The first E1 series set, M1, was delivered to Sendai Depot on 3 March 1994, sporting &quot;DDS E1&quot; logos (DDS standing for double-deck shinkansen).
ローカル鉄道途中下車の旅 The first two E1 series sets delivered entered revenue-earning service on the Tohoku Shinkansen on 15 July 1994, with the original &quot;DDS&quot; logos replaced by &quot;Max&quot; logos. The original livery was &quot;sky grey&quot; on the upper body side and &quot;silver grey&quot; on the lower body side, separated by a &quot;peacock green&quot; stripe.

From 4 December 1999, all six trainsets were transferred from Sendai Depot to Niigata Depot, with operations limited to use on Joetsu Shinkansen &quot;Max Asahi&quot; and &quot;Max Tanigawa&quot; services only.

===Refurbishment===

From late 2003, the fleet underwent refurbishment, which included the installation of new seating and repainting in a new livery of &quot;stratus white&quot; on the upper body side and &quot;aster blue&quot; on the lower body side, separated by a &quot;ibis pink&quot; stripe.

All cars were made no-smoking from the start of the revised timetable on 18 March 2007.

===Withdrawal===

The first two sets were officially withdrawn in April 2012: M1 on 2 April, and M2 on 14 April. The remaining fleet was withdrawn from service from the start of the revised timetable on 29 September 2012.

A special service ran from Niigata to Tokyo on 27 October 2012 using an E1 series set, followed by a final run from Tokyo to Niigata on 28 October 2012, using set M4.

==Bodyside logos==
Between 1 December 2001 and 31 March 2002, the E1 series fleet was adorned with &quot;Alpen Super Express&quot; logos as part of JR East&#x27;s &quot;JR + Snow&quot; promotional campaign.

From mid August 2012 until the fleet&#x27;s final withdrawal on 28 September, the remaining three sets had a second &quot;toki&quot; crested ibis added to their logos to celebrate the rare hatching of ibis chicks in the wild.

==Preserved examples==
One E1 series car is preserved: car E153-104 of set M4. This was moved to the Railway Museum in Saitama in December 2017, and is on display since spring 2018.

<text>José Íñigo Homer Lacambra Ayala (born June 1, 1956), professionally known as Joey Ayala, is a Filipino singer, songwriter and former chairman of the music committee of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. He is well known for his style of music that combines the sounds of Filipino ethnic instruments with modern pop music. His public music life started when he released an album recorded in a makeshift studio in 1982 in Davao City. To date, he has released fourteen albums.

Some of the Filipino ethnic instruments Ayala is known to use include the two-stringed &quot;Hegalong&quot; of the T&#x27;Boli people of Mindanao, the &quot;Kubing&quot;, the bamboo jaw harp found in various forms throughout the Philippines, and the 8-piece gong set, &quot;Kulintang&quot;, the melodic gong-rack of the indigenous peoples of the southern regions of the country. He also uses modern instruments in his music, such as the electric guitar, bass guitar, synthesizer/sequencer and drums.

The name of his band &quot;Bagong Lumad&quot; literally means &quot;New Native&quot;, a name and philosophy that was carried over into &quot;Bagong Lumad Artists Foundation, Inc.&quot; (www.blafi.org), now a &quot;UNDP Responsible Party&quot; working on &quot;SiningBayan&quot; (Social Artistry) capacity-building projects with the Civil Service Commission, the Department of Education, and other GOs and NGOs in the Philippines. He served as the (2008–10) Chairman and Vice-Chairman (2011–13) of the National Committee on Music under the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.

In 2013, Ayala entered the second Philippine Popular Music Festival as a composer and interpreter for the song, &quot;Papel&quot;, where it vied as one of its twelve finalists. The song featured collaborations with rapper Gloc-9 and guest vocals by Denise Barbacena. He previously participated in 2012 as an interpreter for the song &quot;Piso&quot; written by Kristofferson Melecio.

In 2014, Ayala was featured in the BBC Travel episode featuring the Philippines.

<doc id="321633" wikidata="Q6684947" url="?curid=321633" title="Lotteries in the United States">
<text>In the United States, lotteries are run by 48 jurisdictions: 45 states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Lotteries are subject to the laws of and operated independently by each jurisdiction, and there is no national lottery organization. However, consortiums of state lotteries jointly organize games spanning larger geographical footprints, which in turn, carry larger jackpots. Two major lottery games, Mega Millions and Powerball, are both offered in nearly all jurisdictions that operate lotteries, and serve as &quot;de facto&quot; national lotteries.

In fiscal 2018, Americans spent $77.7 billion on various lotteries, up by about $5 billion from 2017.

== History ==
Historian Neal Millikan using newspaper advertisements in the colonial era found at least 392 lotteries were held in the 13 colonies.

Lotteries were used not only as a form of entertainment but as a source of revenue to help fund the colonies. The financiers of Jamestown, Virginia, for instance, funded lotteries to raise money to support their colony. These lotteries were quite sophisticated for the time period and even included instant winners. Not long after, each of the 13 original colonies established a lottery system to raise revenue.

In the early post-independence era, legislators commonly authorized lotteries to fund schools, roads, bridges, and other public works. Evangelical reformers in the 1830s began denouncing lotteries on moral grounds and petitioned legislatures and constitutional conventions to ban them. Recurring lottery scandals and a general backlash against legislative corruption following the Panic of 1837 also contributed to anti-lottery sentiments. From 1844 to 1859 alone, 10 new state constitutions contained lottery bans. By 1890, lotteries were prohibited in every state except Delaware and Louisiana.

Lotteries in the United States did not always have sterling reputations. One early lottery in particular, the National Lottery, which was passed by Congress for the beautification of Washington, D.C., and was administered by the municipal government, was the subject of a major U.S. Supreme Court decision – &quot;Cohens v. Virginia&quot;.

The lottery never paid out, and it brought to light the prevalent issue of crookedness amongst the lotteries in the United States. The wave of anti-lottery protests finally broke through when, by 1860, all states had prohibited lotteries except Delaware, Missouri, and Kentucky. The scarcity of lotteries in the United States meant that tickets were shipped across the country and eventually led to the creation of illegal lotteries. In 1868, after years of illegal operation, the Louisiana State Lottery Company obtained a 25-year charter for its state lottery system. The charter was passed by the legislature due to immense bribing from a criminal syndicate in New York. The Louisiana Lottery Company derived 90% of its revenue from tickets sold across state borders. These continued issues of corruption led to the complete prohibition of lotteries in the United States by 1895. It was discovered that the promoters of the Louisiana Lottery Company had accrued immense sums of money from illegitimate sources and that the legislature was riddled with bribery. Before the advent of government-sponsored lotteries, many illegal lotteries thrived, such as number games.

===Modern era===
The first modern government-run US lottery was established in Puerto Rico in 1934. This was followed, decades later, by the New Hampshire Lottery in 1964.
Instant lottery tickets, also known as scratch cards, were introduced in the 1970s and have become a major source of lottery revenue. Individual lotteries often feature three-digit and four-digit games akin to numbers games; a five number game, and a six number game (the latter two often have a jackpot). Some lotteries also offer at least one game similar to keno, and some offer video lottery terminals. Presently, many US lotteries support public education systems.

As of November 2019, lotteries are established in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; the most recent U.S. state to legalize a lottery is Mississippi, with lottery commission members receiving appointments on October 19, 2018.

The first U.S. multi-state lottery game was formed in 1985 in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; its flagship game remains Tri-State Megabucks. In 1988, the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) was formed with Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia as its charter members; it is best known for Powerball, which was designed to create large jackpots. Another joint lottery, &quot;The Big Game&quot; (now called Mega Millions), was formed in 1996 by six lotteries as its charter members.

As of October 2020, each of the 45 state lotteries offer both Mega Millions and Powerball as a result of a 2009 agreement between the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL to cross-license their game to one another&#x27;s members, although the two organizations continue to administer Mega Millions and Powerball separately. Mississippi was the most recent to join both, beginning sales in January 2020. Puerto Rico is the only jurisdiction not to offer both, as they do not offer Mega Millions.

===State revenues===
State lotteries have become a significant source of revenue for states, raising $17.6 billion in profits for state budgets in the 2009 fiscal year (FY) with 11 states collecting more revenue from their state lottery than from their state corporate income tax during FY2009.

Lottery policies within states can have conflicting goals. Given that instructions are passed down from state legislatures, lottery implementation is often expected to be carried out with reduced advertising and funding while still producing the same amount of revenue. This issue led states to look for loopholes in the system. Massachusetts, for example, had its advertising budget dramatically cut, and therefore started using free-play coupons as money to pay for advertising. This led to an IRS investigation into alleged non-reporting of income because the IRS considered the coupons to have monetary value.

===States with no lotteries===
Among the states that do not have lotteries, Alabama cites religious objections and Utah&#x27;s state constitution bans all forms of gambling. Nevada&#x27;s gambling industry has lobbied against a state lottery there, fearing the competition; similarly, the Mississippi Gaming Commission expressed concern that a state lottery would constitute a &quot;competing force&quot; for gambling dollars spent at Mississippi casinos. Despite this, in August 2018, Mississippi passed legislation to create a state lottery. Governor Phil Bryant expressed his support for the lottery to fund transportation in the state and has indicated he will sign the bill. Sales, initially only scratch tickets, began on November 25, 2019. Mega Millions and Powerball tickets became available to the state on January 30, 2020.

Alaska and Hawaii, being outside the contiguous United States, have not felt the pressure of losing sales to competitors. However, in February 2020, Alaska&#x27;s governor Mike Dunleavy introduced legislation proposing the establishment of an Alaska Lottery Corporation, as part of an effort to overcome a budgetary deficit.

===New technologies===
In recent years, new applications such as Lotto.com, Lottery.com, and Jackpocket were created for people to purchase state lottery tickets over their smartphones.

<text>The is a Japanese high-speed Shinkansen train type operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) on the Tohoku Shinkansen high-speed lines in Japan since 1997. They are formed in 8- and 10-car sets. The 8-car sets were used on the Hokuriku Shinkansen, and the 10-car sets are on Tohoku Shinkansen services. The 10-car sets can be coupled to E3 series sets using couplers hidden behind retracting nose doors.

They operate at a maximum speed of on the Tohoku Shinkansen.

A total of 502 vehicles (14 8-car &quot;N&quot; sets and 39 10-car &quot;J&quot; sets) were built between 1997 and 2010, with the first withdrawals commencing in late 2013.

==8-car &quot;N&quot; sets==

The fleet of thirteen &quot;N&quot; sets was constructed for the new &quot;Asama&quot; services on the newly constructed Nagano Shinkansen (present-day Hokuriku Shinkansen) to Nagano from 1 October 1997, and are classified simply &quot;E2 series&quot;. Units N2 onwards were delivered from March 1997 to September 1997. These sets are compatible with both the 50 Hz supply used by JR East and the 60 Hz supply used west of Karuizawa on the Hokuriku Shinkansen, and are limited to a maximum speed of . Tohoku Shinkansen set J1 was transferred to Nagano depot in October 2002 and renumbered as set N21.

The fleet of &quot;N&quot; sets underwent a programme of life-extension refurbishment from fiscal 2013.

Withdrawals of E2 series &quot;N&quot; sets commenced in April 2014, with the withdrawal of sets N4 and N12. The remaining E2 series sets were removed from regularly scheduled Hokuriku Shinkansen &quot;Asama&quot; services from 25 December 2015, with the last E2 series &quot;Asama&quot; run taking place on 31 March 2017.

===Formation===
Cars 4 and 6 are equipped with PS205 scissors-type pantographs.

===Fleet list===
, the fleet was as follows:
==E2&#x27; series 10-car &quot;J&quot; sets==
The initial fleet of six &quot;J&quot; sets was constructed as eight-car trains for the start of the new Akita shinkansen services starting in March 1997, and ran in conjunction with E3 series Akita Shinkansen units on Tōhoku Shinkansen &quot;Yamabiko&quot;/&quot;Komachi&quot; services between Tokyo and Morioka. These sets are classified E2&#x27;, and are equipped with retractable nose-end couplers at the Morioka end. Units J2 onwards were delivered from December 1996 to March 1997.

As with the Nagano Shinkansen N units, these sets are also compatible with both 50 Hz and 60 Hz (25 kV) power supplies, and were also used on Nagano Shinkansen &quot;Asama&quot; services before they were lengthened to ten cars. A further four J sets were delivered in October/November 1998 to augment the fleet to coincide with the introduction E2 series stock on four return &quot;Asahi&quot; services between Tokyo and Niigata on the Jōetsu Shinkansen from the start of the revised timetable in December 1998. From September 2002, the fleet of J sets (except J1) was augmented from 8 to 10 cars with the addition of newly built intermediate cars for use on &quot;Hayate&quot; services to Hachinohe commencing in December 2002. The red stripe on these lengthened sets was also changed to magenta, and the original &quot;wind&quot; bodyside logo was changed to the new &quot;Hayate&quot; logo.

Withdrawals of E2 series &quot;J&quot; sets commenced in October 2013, with the withdrawal of sets J2 and J3. The last remaining original &quot;J&quot; sets were withdrawn before the start of the revised timetable on 16 March 2019.


===Formation===
Cars 4 and 6 are equipped with PS205 scissors-type pantographs.

===Fleet list===
==E2-1000 series 10-car &quot;J&quot; sets==

The prototype E2-1000 series train (unit J51) was delivered as an 8-car to Sendai depot in late December 2000, and entered revenue-earning service in November 2001 after extensive testing. Units J52 onwards were delivered as 10-car units from July 2002, entering service on the Tohoku Shinkansen from December 2002. These trains replaced life-expired 200 series trains and augment JR East&#x27;s fleet for use on new &quot;Hayate&quot; services following the opening of the Tōhoku Shinkansen extension to Hachinohe in December 2002.

The E2-1000 series incorporates a number of design improvements compared with the earlier batches, the most noticeable of which is the change from small windows for each seating bay to wide windows similar to the E4 series trains. A new single-arm pantograph design is used with an aerofoil-shaped mounting that eliminates the need for pantograph shrouds. The pre-series set, J51, was equipped with automatic couplers at both ends, but sets J52 onwards have couplers at the northern end only, as on the earlier E2&#x27; trains. Unlike the earlier J sets, these units are only compatible with the 50 Hz power supply of the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen routes and they aren&#x27;t equipped with slope-usable brake systems. The flush-fitting plug doors of the earlier N and J sets were replaced by conventional sliding doors on these units. While J51 was delivered in the same livery as earlier E2 series trains, units J52 onward were delivered from new in the &quot;Hayate&quot; livery with a magenta waistline stripe in place of the previous red and a new &quot;apple&quot; logo in place of the &quot;wind&quot; logo on the original batch of J and N units.

Withdrawals of E2-1000 series sets commenced in March 2019, beginning with set J51.

Effective 18 March 2023, all sets have been withdrawn from Joetsu Shinkansen services and restricted to services on the Tohoku Shinkansen as a result of operating speed upgrades on the Joetsu Shinkansen; from .

===Formation===
Cars 4 and 6 are equipped with PS207 single-arm pantographs. Car 1 of set No. J51 is numbered E223-1101.

===Fleet list===
==Pre-series units==
The pre-series E2&#x27; series unit S7 (renumbered as J1 and later as N21) was delivered in April 1995, with S6 (now numbered as N1) delivered in June of the same year. Visually, these two units differed from subsequent production standard units in having large pantograph shields resembling the original 300 series design. These were later changed to the current low-profile design.

==Interior==
Seating is 2+3 in standard class with a seat pitch of , and 2+2 in green class with a seat pitch of .

==Test running==
An E2-1000 series train (J56) broke the Japanese rail speed record for a production train (i.e. not a dedicated test train) in April 2003 when it reached a speed of during a series of late-night high-speed test runs between Urasa and Niigata on the Joetsu Shinkansen.

== Special liveries ==

To celebrate 150 years of rail transport in Japan, JR East announced plans in 2022 to repaint a set into a livery similar to that of the 200 series when they first entered service in 1982. The special livery was painted on set J66 and introduced on 8 June 2022. Set J66 was retired on 15 March 2024, a day before the start of the revised timetable on 16 March 2024.

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Tokyo Disney Resort, set J69 was wrapped with a Disney-themed wrap, featuring artworks of Disney characters. Set J69 with the special wrap, nicknamed the Magical Dream Shinkansen, was introduced on 22 December 2023.

==Exports==
China ordered a number of trains based on the E2-1000 series design, renamed it as CRH2, becoming the second Shinkansen train exported after the 700T for Taiwan. These CRH2 trains consist of a total of 60 sets; the first three sets (2001-2003) were built in Japan, the next six sets were delivered in complete knock down (CKD) form and assembled by CSR Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock, the remaining 51 sets were built by Sifang through technology transfer from Japan. The first train arrived at the port of Qingdao on 8 March 2006.

Subsequent orders included 50 additional trains and a new order for 140 trains placed in 2009 with the Sino-Japanese joint venture.

==Withdrawals==
Withdrawals of E2 series sets commenced in October 2013, with the withdrawal of sets J2 and J3.

==Preserved examples==
Car E223-23 of former set J10 was moved from Sendai Depot to Sanwa Tekki Corporation in Utsunomiya, Tochigi, in February 2017, where it is preserved.

Car E223-1101 is used as a training facility at the Shinkansen Education and Training Center, a training facility of JR East.

Car E224-127 of former set J14 was moved from Sendai Depot to the Hirosawa City theme park in Chikusei, Ibaraki, in November 2018, where it is preserved.

<doc id="321636" wikidata="Q3079991" url="?curid=321636" title="Four Organs">
<text>Four Organs is a work for four electronic organs and maraca, composed by Steve Reich in January 1970.

==Music==
The four organs harmonically expound a dominant eleventh chord (E–D–E–F–G–A–B), dissecting the chord by playing parts of it sequentially while the chord slowly increases in duration from a single 1/8 note at the beginning to 200 beats at the end. The process of increased augmentation is accomplished first by causing notes to sustain after the chord, and then notes start anticipating the chord. As the piece progresses, this &quot;deconstruction&quot; of the chord emphasizes certain harmonies. At the climax of the work, each tone sounds almost in sequence. A continuous maraca beat serves as a rhythmic framework.

Reich describes the piece as &quot;the longest V–I cadence in the history of Western Music&quot;, the V and I chords being contained within the one chord. &quot;You&#x27;ll find the chord in Debussy and Thelonious Monk – the tonic on top and the dominant on the bottom.&quot; He has cited the music of Pérotin and other twelfth- and thirteenth-century composers as suggesting the technique of note augmentation used in &quot;Four Organs&quot;.

For performances of the piece, Reich recommended using electronic organs with as plain and simple a timbre as possible, without vibrato, to avoid the sound of the instrument itself distracting from the harmonic and rhythmic aspects of the piece. Reich himself employed four Farfisa &quot;mini compact&quot; models.

A typical performance lasts around 16 minutes.

==Performances==
&quot;Four Organs&quot; was first performed in May 1970 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. It was received well at the premiere, and performances later that year in the United States and Europe received respectful, and in some cases enthusiastic, responses.

Subsequent audiences were not always as polite. October 1971 performances by Reich and members of the Boston Symphony (at Symphony Hall, Boston) received a combination of &quot;loud cheers, loud boos, and whistles.&quot;

A 1973 performance of &quot;Four Organs&quot; at Carnegie Hall in New York City nearly caused a riot, with &quot;yells for the music to stop, mixed with applause to hasten the end of the piece.&quot; One of the performers, Michael Tilson Thomas, recalls: &quot;One woman walked down the aisle and repeatedly banged her head on the front of the stage, wailing &#x27;Stop, stop, I confess.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="321637" wikidata="Q1536547" url="?curid=321637" title="Saab 90">
<text>The Saab 90 is a family car produced by Saab from September 1984 to 1987. It was manufactured at a facility in Uusikaupunki (Nystad), Finland, at that time owned by a joint venture with Finnish Valmet called Saab-Valmet. The 90 was a continuation of the Saab 99, and it was basically a Saab 99 from the B-pillar forward with the rear of a Saab 900 sedan. The 90, while easier to build than the 99, was still considerably more labour-intensive than the more modern 900.

==History==

When the production of the Saab 96 was completed in 1980, the head of Saab&#x27;s passenger car division, Sten Wennlo, was under intense pressure to create a new base model for the European market. Also people at Saab-Valmet were concerned about the fate of the Saab 99, as its production took place entirely in Nystad. Saab-Valmet&#x27;s first solution from 1983 was to weld the front end of a Saab 900 together with the rear end of a 99. When the product was shown to Wennlo, he stated that the principle was good, but the car became too much like the 900.

Wennlo thought that the car should be done the other way around, and in March 1984 he asked Rony Lutz, who worked as an illustrator at Saab, to cut together two press images on the front of a Saab 99 and the rear of a Saab 900 sedan.

The sheet metal workers at Saab-Valmet in Nystad thus welded together two bodies in the same way and only then was the car shown to Björn Envall, who was then design manager at Saab.

That the name was changed from 99 to 90 was because the name would harmonize better with the Saab 900 and the then new Saab 9000.

==Model overview==
In 1985, the Saab 90 was only available as a two-door sedan and it came with the 2.0-litre Saab H engine, giving .

It was available with both four and a five-speed manual transmissions, with the five-speed receiving closer gearing, front and rear spoilers, and lower profile tires. Also the transmission was changed and with the new rear end, the volume of the fuel tank increased and also the luggage compartment volume increased from 320 to 377 liters. The car got a modern rear wheel suspension which was also cheaper to manufacture.

The valve seats were hardened so it could run on unleaded fuel. It also had a new starter motor, and the steering wheel was more upright than the one in the 99.

In 1986 it underwent some minor cosmetic changes. It gained a radio option and side turn signals. The 4-speed model got the 5.5-inch wide rims and was fitted with modified shock absorbers.

In 1987 the Zenith carburettor was altered to make it easier to start in cold weather.

===Saab 90 Lumikko===
A limited edition &quot;Saab 90 Lumikko &quot; was made for the Finnish market. Ten examples were made by Finnish Scan-Auto in 1985. The Lumikko received Saab&#x27;s Airflow kit, spoiler, rims from Saab 900 Aero, sunroof, center console with extra gauges, leather steering wheel, and Saab factory speakers. These models were all white, including the rims, bumpers, grille, side mirrors, spoiler, and door handles. No modifications were made under the hood.

All ten &quot;90 Lumikkos&quot; took part at Scan-Auto&#x27;s 20th anniversary celebration at Tampere in November 1985 and were part of the parade through the city.

There are currently only three 90 &quot;Lumikkos&quot; in working order. All of them are owned by the Finnish Saab club.

==Sales, reception and legacy==
In total, 25,378 Saab 90s were made. It was sold in a limited number of European countries only. The production took place only in Nystad, Finland, by Valmet Automotive.

About 10,000 cars were sold in Sweden. A total of 1,154 Saab 90s were delivered and sold in the Netherlands, of which 446 in 1985, 451 in 1986 and 257 in 1987. About 600 vehicles were delivered to Germany.

Falling sales meant that it was not worth the investment to catalyze the engine and 1987 was the final year for the model. The last car was built on 1 July and it was immediately dispatched to the Saab museum in Trollhättan.

<doc id="321642" wikidata="Q7079140" url="?curid=321642" title="Office Workstations Limited">
<text>Office Workstations Limited (OWL) was a British software company based in Edinburgh.

OWL was founded in 1984 by five former employees of ICL (Ian Ritchie, Stuart Harper, Gordon Dougan, Richard Stonehouse and Dave MacLaren) who had previously worked at ICL&#x27;s Scottish Development Centre at Dalkeith Palace until its closure the previous year.

The following year (1985), OWL International Inc., a United States subsidiary, was formed in Seattle. The American subsidiary, then headed by ex-Microsoft executive Alan M. Boyd achieved considerable attention (particularly from Esther Dyson who understood its potential) but was eventually sidelined when Apple elected to bundle their Hypercard product free with every Macintosh. This caused considerable consternation amongst Apple&#x27;s developer community who became wary of Apple&#x27;s motives for requiring developers to submit product designs for approval.

==Hypertext Pioneer==
OWL developed and supported Guide, a pioneering hypertext authoring system for the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows, originally conceived at the University of Kent.

Guide was likely the first ever commercially available hypertext browser, when it was introduced on the Macintosh in 1986, nearly a decade before hypertext became the standard method of developing and browsing the Internet.

==Ownership==
OWL was bought for over £7m in 1989 by Matsushita Electric Industrial (MEI) of Japan and became Panasonic Office Workstations Ltd.. They subsequently developed software to support next generation consumer electronics., including DVD technology, Digital television, next generation mobile communications, Internet delivery of multimedia and 3D car navigation systems.

==Spin Off Companies==
A number of spin-off companies were formed by ex-OWL employees, including InfoAccess (a management buy-out of OWL International Inc.), Electrum Multimedia Ltd., CAPDM Limited, Data Discoveries Ltd. and Digital Bridges Ltd.

==Closure==
On 30 April 2005 Panasonic OWL was shut down.

<doc id="321643" wikidata="Q1093290" url="?curid=321643" title="Cittern">
<text>The cittern or cithren (Fr. &quot;cistre&quot;, It. &quot;cetra&quot;, Ger. &quot;Cister,&quot; Sp. &quot;cistro, cedra, cítola&quot;) is a stringed instrument dating from the Renaissance. Modern scholars debate its exact history, but it is generally accepted that it is descended from the medieval citole (or cytole). Its flat-back design was simpler and cheaper to construct than the lute. It was also easier to play, smaller, less delicate and more portable. Played by people of all social classes, the cittern was a popular instrument of casual music-making much like the guitar is today.

== History ==
=== Pre-modern citterns ===

The cittern is one of the few metal-strung instruments known from the Renaissance music period. It generally has four courses of strings (single, pairs or threes depending on design or regional variation), one or more courses being usually tuned in octaves, though instruments with more or fewer courses were made. The cittern may have a range of only an octave between its lowest and highest strings and employs a re-entrant tuning – a tuning in which the string that is physically uppermost is not the lowest, as is also the case with the five-string banjo and most ukuleles for example. The tuning and narrow range allow the player a number of simple chord shapes useful for both simple song accompaniment and dances, though much more complex music was also written for it. Its bright and cheerful timbre make it a valuable counterpoint to gut-strung instruments. The Spanish bandurria, still used today, is a similar instrument.

=== 16th to 18th centuries ===

From the 16th until the 18th century the cittern was a common English barber shop instrument, kept in waiting areas for customers to entertain themselves and others with, and popular sheet music for the instrument was published to that end. The top of the pegbox was often decorated with a small carved head, perhaps not always of great artistic merit; in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, the term &quot;cittern-head&quot; is used as an insult:

:: HOLOFERNES: What is this?
:: BOYET: A cittern-head.
:: DUMAIN: The head of a bodkin.
:: BIRON: A Death&#x27;s face in a ring.

Just as the lute was enlarged and bass-extended to become the theorbo and chitarrone for continuo work, so the cittern was developed into the ceterone, with its extended neck and unstopped bass strings, though this was a much less common instrument.

Gérard Joseph Deleplanque (1723-1784) was a luthier from Lille who made a wide variety of instruments, including citterns.

The instrument maker Johann Wilhelm Bindernagel (around 1770-1845), who worked in Gotha, made a mixed guitar-cittern under the name &quot;Sister&quot; or &quot;German Guitar&quot;, which was equipped with seven gut strings.

The leading 18th-century Swedish songwriter Carl Michael Bellman played mostly on the cittern, and is shown with the instrument (now in the National Museum, Stockholm) in a 1779 portrait by Per Krafft the elder.

=== Modern citterns ===

In Germany, the cittern survives under the names &quot;Waldzither&quot; and &quot;Lutherzither&quot;. The last name comes from the belief that Martin Luther played this instrument. Also, the names &quot;Thüringer Waldzither&quot; in Thüringer Wald, &quot;Harzzither&quot; in the Harz mountains, &quot;Halszither&quot; in German-speaking Switzerland are used. There is a tendency in modern German to interchange the words for cittern and zither. The term waldzither came into use around 1900, to distinguish citterns from zithers.

The cittern family survives as the Corsican cetara and the Portuguese guitar. The &quot;guitarra portuguesa&quot; is typically used to play the popular traditional music known as fado. In the early 1970s, using the guitarra and a 1930s archtop Martin guitar as models, English luthier Stefan Sobell created a &quot;cittern&quot;, a hybrid instrument primarily used for playing folk music, which has proved to be popular with folk revival musicians.

<text>Al Arabiya (, transliterated: &quot;&quot;; meaning &quot;The Arabic One&quot; or &quot;The Arab One&quot;) is a Saudi state-owned international Arabic news television channel. It is based in Riyadh and is a subsidiary of MBC Group.

The channel is a flagship of the media conglomerate and is therefore the only single offering to carry the name as simply &quot;Al Arabiya&quot; in its branding.

==History==
Al Arabiya was originally launched in Dubai Media City, United Arab Emirates, on 3 March 2003. An early funder, the production company Middle East News (then headed by Ali Al-Hedeithy), said the goal was to provide &quot;a balanced and less provocative&quot; alternative to Al Jazeera.

A free-to-air channel, Al Arabiya broadcasts standard newscasts every hour, as well as talk shows and documentaries. It has been rated among the top pan-Arab stations by Middle East audiences. The news organization&#x27;s website is accessible in Arabic, English, Urdu, and Persian.

On 26 January 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama gave his first formal interview as president to Al Arabiya, delivering the message to the Muslim world that &quot;Americans are not your enemy,&quot; while also reiterating that &quot;Israel is a strong ally of the United States&quot; and that they &quot;will not stop being a strong ally of the United States&quot;.

In March 2012, the channel launched a new channel, Al-Hadath, which focused on political news.

Mamdouh Al-Muhaini became general manager of the Al Arabiya Network in October 2019, succeeding former manager Nabil Al-Khatib.

On 24 April 2020, Al Arabiya introduced a new graphics and audio package, new studios, and a new modified logo in the network&#x27;s first major rebrand since its launch in 2003. The following year, the network moved operations from Dubai to Riyadh, with the stated goal being to &quot;produce 12 hours of news programming from the Saudi capital by early January&quot;. The move came amid orders by the Saudi government to multinational companies to move their regional hubs to the kingdom by 2024.

==Content and competition==
As a response to Al Jazeera&#x27;s critical coverage of the Saudi royal family throughout the 1990s, relatives of the Saudi royal family established Al Arabiya in Dubai in 2002. Al Arabiya was said to be the second most frequently watched channel after Al Jazeera in Saudi Arabia. In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the channel as working &quot;to cure Arab television of its penchant for radical politics and violence&quot;.

In 2012, Al Arabiya broadcast the email messages of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad that were leaked by opposition hackers.

==Programming==

==Investment and ownership==
Al Arabiya was founded through investment by the Middle East Broadcasting Center, as well as other investors from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the Persian Gulf states. Through MBC, Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd and his maternal uncle Waleed bin Ibrahim al Ibrahim have partial ownership of Al Arabiya.

==Controversies and criticism==
Al Arabiya has been the topic of controversy. It has been criticized as an arm of Saudi foreign policy.

On 14 February 2005, Al Arabiya was the first news satellite channel to air news of the assassination of Rafik Hariri. In September 2008, Iran expelled Al Arabiya&#x27;s Tehran bureau chief Hassan Fahs, the third Al Arabiya correspondent expelled from Iran since the network opened an Iran office. In October of the same year, the Al Arabiya website was hacked by attackers who claimed to be Shi&#x27;ites.

In 2009, Courtney C. Radsch lost her job the day after publishing an article about safety problems on Emirates airline, a move Al Arabiya described as restructuring in the English department. In June 2009, the Iranian government ordered the Al Arabiya office in Tehran to be closed for a week for &quot;unfair reporting&quot; of the Iranian presidential election. Seven days later, amid the 2009 Iranian election protests, the network&#x27;s office was &quot;closed indefinitely&quot; by the government.

In 2016, Al Arabiya dismissed 50 staff members, including journalists. Citing financial problems stemming from low oil prices, the dismissed individuals were offered salaries and benefits for six months as a severance package.

In April 2017, Al Arabiya was found in breach of UK broadcasting law by the UK media regulator, Ofcom, for broadcasting an interview with an imprisoned Bahraini torture survivor. Ofcom concluded that it infringed on the privacy of imprisoned Bahraini opposition leader and torture survivor Hassan Mushaima, when it broadcast footage of him obtained during his arbitrary detention in Bahrain. Ofcom sanctioned the licence holder Al Arabiya News Channel FZ-LLC by fining them , broadcasting an on-air apology. The channel then surrendered its license to broadcast in the following month after an additional complaint was filed by Qatar News Agency.

===Arab criticism===
In November 2004, the interim Iraqi government banned Al Arabiya from reporting from the country after it broadcast an audio tape reportedly made by the deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Two years later, the Iraqi government also banned the channel for one month for &quot;imprecise coverage&quot;. According to the station itself, Al Arabiya journalists and staff have come under constant pressure from Iraqi officials to allegedly &quot;report stories as dictated to&quot; and in 2014, Iraqi PM Nouri Maliki threatened again to ban Al Arabiya in Iraq, shut down its offices and websites. For his part, Al Arabiya&#x27;s General Manager at the time, Abdulrahman al-Rashed, vowed in a statement that the news channel and its sister channel al-Hadath will continue reporting the story in Iraq despite &quot;Maliki&#x27;s threats&quot; as well as other threats from the likes of ISIS.

Due to post-coverage of assassination of Rafic Hariri, as of 2007, Syrian politicians have criticized al-Arabiya for anti-government and perceived pro-US and pro-Israeli bias.

In 2013, Saudi Islamic scholar Abdulaziz al-Tarefe criticized the channel in a viral tweet.

The Algerian Ministry of Communication released a statement on 31 July 2021 saying that it withdrew Al Arabiya&#x27;s operating accreditation in Algeria, due to what it termed &quot;the non-respect by this channel of the rules of deontology and its recourse to disinformation and manipulation&quot;.

The Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement&#x27;s Arabic-language account published a call to boycott Al Arabiya and some other arabic language channels what they called &quot;the mouthpieces of the Israeli enemy that speak Arabic&quot;

===Killed and abducted reporters===
In September 2003, Al Arabiya reporter Mazen al-Tumeizi was killed on camera in Iraq when a U.S. helicopter fired on a crowd in Haifa Street in Baghdad.

In February 2006, three Al Arabiya reporters were abducted and murdered while covering the aftermath of the bombing of a mosque in Samarra, Iraq. Among them was correspondent Atwar Bahjat, an Iraqi national.

In 2012, Al Arabiya&#x27;s Asia correspondent Baker Atyani was abducted in the Philippines by an armed militia. He was released after 18 months.

===Plagiarism===
In August 2015, the &quot;Egyptian Streets&quot; news website said Al-Arabiya had copied &quot;word-for-word&quot; from two of its articles. Al Arabiya later updated one of the articles and added a note citing the error.

===Fake reporters===
In 2020, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; identified a network of false personas used to insert opinion pieces aligned with UAE government policy to media outlets including Al Arabiya. The pieces were critical about Turkey&#x27;s role in the Middle East, as well as Qatar and particularly its state media Al Jazeera. Twitter suspended some of the fake columnists&#x27; accounts in early July 2020.

===Notable interviews===
In 2009, Al Arabiya aired an interview between journalist Hisham Melhem and then newly-elected president of the United States, Barack Obama. The broadcast was the first-ever formal interview with Obama during his first administration.

During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the channel interviewed Armenian President Armen Sarkissian about the ongoing war happening between Armenia and Azerbaijan, during which President Sarkissian blasted Turkey and Azerbaijan for inflaming the conflict. In response, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of destabilization in the Caucasus and Middle East, resulting in Saudi Arabian Commercial Chamber&#x27;s Head Ajlan Al-Ajlan to call for boycott against Turkish goods.

== Distribution ==
In March 2022, Al Arabiya acquired its own Freeview channel in the United Kingdom, after being available on Freeview via the Vision TV streaming service, with both channels being available on Freeview channel 273. The channel also operates a business website that covers financial news and market data from the Middle East in Arabic. Al Arabiya streams online on JumpTV and Livestation. The English website of Al Arabiya was relaunched in 2013 and now features automated subtitles of the news and programs that appear on the channel.

The Al Arabiya website experienced technical difficulties during the Egyptian protests at the end of January 2011. The site went offline with error messages as such as the following: &quot;The website is down due to the heavy traffic to follow up with the Egyptian crisis and it will be back within three hours (Time of message: 11 GMT)&quot;.

<text>Sir Sydney Camm, CBE, FRAeS (5 August 189312 March 1966) was an English aeronautical engineer who contributed to many Hawker aircraft designs, from the biplanes of the 1920s to jet fighters. One particularly notable aircraft he designed was the Hawker Hurricane fighter.

==Early years==
Sydney Camm was born at 10 Alma Road in Windsor, Berkshire, the eldest child of the twelve children of Frederick Camm, a carpenter/joiner and Mary Smith. The Camm family lived near Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station. His brother Frederick James Camm became a technical author, and created the &quot;Practical Wireless&quot; magazine.

In 1901 he began attending the Royal Free School on Bachelors Acre in Windsor (The Royal Free school became the Royal Free Middle School with the secondary school becoming the Princess Margaret Royal Free School on Bourne Avenue). In 1906 he was granted a Foundation Scholarship. In 1908 Camm left school to become an apprentice carpenter.

Camm developed an interest in aeronautics. Camm and his brothers began building model aircraft which they supplied to Herbert&#x27;s Eton High Street shop. After finding that they could obtain a higher price they began making direct sales to boys at Eton College, which were delivered in secret to avoid attracting the attention of Herbert and the school authorities.

These activities led him to being one of the founders of the Windsor Model Aeroplane Club in early 1912. His accomplishments as a model aeroplane builder culminated in a man-carrying glider which he and others at the club built in 1912.

==Aviation career==
Shortly before the start of World War I Camm obtained a position as a shop-floor carpenter at the Martinsyde aircraft company which was located at the Brooklands racing circuit in Weybridge, Surrey. His ability soon led to his being promoted to the drawing office, where he spent the war period. In 1919 his handbook &quot;Aeroplane construction&quot; was published. After the company went into liquidation in 1921, Camm was employed by George Handasyde, who had created his own aircraft manufacturing company, which was responsible for the creation of the Handasyde Monoplane.

In November 1923 Camm joined the Hawker Aircraft Company (later Hawker Siddeley) based at Canbury Park Road in Kingston upon Thames as a senior draughtsman. His first design was the Cygnet, the success of which led to his being appointed chief designer in 1925.

In 1925, in association with Fred Sigrist, Hawker&#x27;s managing director, Camm developed a form of metal construction that used jointed tubes as a cheaper and simpler alternative to welded structures.

During his employment at Hawker he was responsible for the creation of 52 different types of aircraft, of which a total of 26,000 were manufactured. Among his early designs were the Tomtit, Hornbill, Nimrod, Hart and Fury. At one time in the 1930s 84 per cent of the aircraft in the RAF were designed by Camm.

He then moved on to designing aeroplanes that would become mainstays of the RAF in the Second World War including the Hawker Hurricane, Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tempest.

:&quot;Camm had a one-tracked mind – his aircraft were right, and everybody had to work on them to get them right. If they did not, then there was hell. He was a very difficult man to work for, but you could not have a better aeronautical engineer to work under. [...] With regard to his own staff, he did not suffer fools gladly, and at times many of us appeared to be fools. One rarely got into trouble for doing something either in the ideas line, or in the manufacturing line, but woe betide those who did nothing, or who put forward an indeterminate solution.&quot;

Among the engineers who worked with Camm at Hawker were Sir Frederick Page (later to design the English Electric Lightning), Leslie Appleton (later to design the advanced Fairey Delta 2 and Britain&#x27;s first air-to-air missile, the Fairey Fireflash), Stuart Davies (joined Avro in 1936 and later to be chief designer of the Avro Vulcan), Roy Chaplin (became chief designer at Hawker in 1957) and Sir Robert Lickley (chief project engineer during the war, and later to be chief engineer at Fairey).

===Hurricane===

With the Hurricane, Sydney Camm moved from the technology of the biplane to contemporary monoplane fighter aircraft. The result was that fighters flew faster, and with the improved engine technology of the time, higher, and could be made more deadly than ever.

The Hawker engineer Frank Murdoch was responsible for getting the Hurricane into production in sufficient numbers before the outbreak of the war, after an eye-opening visit to the MAN diesel plant in Augsburg in 1936.

===Typhoon===

When the Typhoon&#x27;s design first emerged and entered squadron service, pilots became aware that there was elevator flutter and buffeting at high speeds, due to the positioning of the heavy Napier Sabre engine intake very close to the wing root.

The engineering of the aircraft to travel at higher speeds and handle compressibility effects was one of the challenges of the day, but with his small design team of one hundred members at Hawker, Camm managed to solve these problems and make the Typhoon an effective combat weapon even at these speeds. As operational requirements changed, the Typhoon was used more as a fighter-bomber, in which role its low level performance, weapon-carrying capabilities and ability to absorb damage made it very effective. It was much used in the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, in which ground-attack aircraft proved very destructive. German losses were so severe that most of France was retaken less than two weeks after the conclusion of this operation.

===Tempest===

The lessons learned from the Hawker Typhoon were incorporated into its successor, the Hawker Tempest. As soon as the Typhoon entered service, the Air Ministry requested a new design. Camm recommended that they keep the existing design of the Typhoon for the most part, with modifications to the aerofoil. He also considered the new and powerful Napier Sabre and Bristol Centaurus engines as the powerplant. Camm decided that both engines would be used: the Tempest Mk 5 was fitted with the Napier Sabre, while the Tempest Mk 2 had the Bristol Centaurus. The design modifications to be made to the aircraft to switch from one engine type to another were minimal, so that little assistance was needed in ferrying these aircraft all the way to India and Pakistan, in the final days of the conflict.

===Sea Fury===
This was a higher performance development of the Tempest with a reduced wing area, a Centaurus engine, and a considerably improved view for the pilot. Named the Fury, only the carrier-based Hawker Sea Fury went into service, serving with the Royal Navy from 1947 to 1955.

==Post-war work==
After the Second World War, Camm created many jet-powered designs which would become important aircraft in the Cold War era.

===Harrier===

Notable among Camm&#x27;s post-war work is his contribution to the design of the Hawker Siddeley P.1127 / Kestrel FGA.1, the progenitor of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. The Harrier is a well-known vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft designed at Hawker Siddeley, which would later merge into British Aerospace, now known as BAE Systems. The Harrier was one of the radical aircraft which took shape in postwar Britain, which required the bringing together of many important technologies, such as vectored thrust engines like the Bristol Siddeley (later Rolls-Royce) Pegasus and technologies like the Reaction Control System. Camm played a major role in determining these and other vital Harrier systems. In 1953, Camm was knighted for these and other achievements and his contribution to British Aviation. The P.1127 first flew on 21 October 1960. Working with Camm on this aircraft and the Hunter was Professor John Fozard, who became head of the Hawker design office in 1961 and would write a biography of Camm in 1991.

===Hunter===

Camm worked on many aircraft built by Hawker before the Harrier, including what is probably his most significant aircraft after the Second World War, the Hawker Hunter.

==Final years==
Sydney Camm was knighted 2 June 1953, on the occasion of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

Camm was President of the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) from 1954 to 1955. Since 1971 the RAeS has held the biennial Sir Sydney Camm Lecture in June, given by the current commander-in-chief of RAF Air Command.

Camm retired as chief designer at Hawker in 1965 and was succeeded by John Fozard. He, however, remained on the board of its successor, Hawker Siddeley until his death.

Before he died, Camm was planning the design of an aircraft to travel at Mach 4, having begun his life in aircraft design with the building of a man-carrying glider in 1912, just nine years after the first powered flight.

In 1966, Camm was awarded the Guggenheim Gold Medal, which had to be presented posthumously.

==Death==
Camm died in his 73rd year on 12 March 1966 whilst playing golf at the Richmond Golf Club.

==Personal life==
Camm lived at Thames Ditton in Surrey. He married Hilda Starnes in 1915 and they had a daughter in 1922.

==Tributes==

&#x27;Camm Gardens&#x27; road in Kingston-upon-Thames was named after Sydney Camm, with a memorial in situ to his memory of a World War 2 propeller engine hub.

In 2012 a full size replica of a Hawker Hurricane was erected near Alexandra Gardens, in Camm&#x27;s home town of Windsor, near to his childhood home.

In 1984, Camm was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

A bronze bust by Ambrose Barber was placed in Kingston Library (2014).

<doc id="321647" wikidata="Q1085422" url="?curid=321647" title="E3 Series Shinkansen">
<text>The is a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed train type built for &quot;Komachi&quot; services which commenced on 3 June 1997, coinciding with the opening of the new Akita Shinkansen &quot;mini-shinkansen&quot; line, a regular narrow-gauge line between and re-gauged to . Later versions of the E3 series were also introduced for use on Yamagata Shinkansen &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services. Both &quot;mini-shinkansen&quot; lines join the Tohoku Shinkansen, providing services to and from Tokyo.

==Design==
This shinkansen design was originally the Akita Shinkansen E3 series trains was overseen by industrial designer Kenji Ekuan. Like the 400 Series Shinkansen, these trains are built to a smaller loading gauge than mainline Shinkansen trains—the width and length of each car is reduced to fit on the narrower clearances of the &quot;mini-shinkansen&quot;. Doorway steps fold out to bridge the gap between the narrow body and the platform at regular shinkansen stations.

==Variants==
* E3 series &quot;R&quot; sets: 26 x 6-car (R1-16 5-cars at first) sets used on Akita Shinkansen &quot;Komachi&quot; services from 3 June 1997 following the opening of the Akita Shinkansen. Retired on 14 March 2014 following the Akita Shinkansen timetable revision and last runs.
* E3-1000 series &quot;LR&quot; sets: 3 x 7-car sets used on Yamagata Shinkansen &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services since 4 December 1999 following the extension to Shinjo. 2 sets (L51 and 52) retired in 2014 following the E3 Tsubasa relivering, while 2 new sets (L54 and 55, converted from E3-0 series sets (R23 to 26) added to replace them.

==Pre-series set==
A pre-series 5-car set, numbered S8, was delivered from Kawasaki Heavy Industries to Sendai Depot in March 1995 for extensive testing. It was modified to full-production specifications in March 1997 ahead of the start of Akita Shinkansen services.

Until it was augmented to six cars in 1998, the pre-series was formed as follows, with scissors-type pantographs on cars 12, 13, and 14. Set R1 was withdrawn following its final revenue run on 20 July 2013.

==E3 series &quot;R&quot; sets==
The full-production trainsets built from 1996 for the Akita Shinkansen were 5-car sets, but sixth cars were added by the end of 1998. A total of 26 Akita Shinkansen sets were in service by the end of 2005. Sets R1 to R16 were leased by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) from the owning company, , a third-sector company jointly owned by JR East and Akita Prefecture. This lease ended on 21 March 2010 with the dissolution of Akita Shinkansen Sharyō Hoyū.

The E3 series sets were phased out following the introduction of new E6 series sets from March 2013, with 19 sets (114 vehicles) scheduled to be withdrawn during fiscal 2013. From the start of the 15 March 2014 timetable revision, E3 series trainsets were no longer used on Akita Shinkansen &quot;Komachi&quot; services. Two sets (R21 and 22) remained in service until 2021, before then they were used on &quot;Yamabiko&quot; and &quot;Nasuno&quot; services coupled to the E5/H5 series.

===Formation===
Cars 12 and 15 were equipped with PS206 single-arm pantographs.

==E3-1000 series==
Three 7-car E3-1000 sets (numbered L51 – L53) were built between 1999 and 2005 for use on Yamagata Shinkansen &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services from 4 December 1999 to augment the 400 series fleet following with the extension of the line to Shinjo. From 2014, a further two sets (L54 and L55) were introduced, reformed from withdrawn Akita Shinkansen E3-0 series &quot;R&quot; sets, to replace the two older sets L51 and L52.

With effect of the timetable revision implemented in March 2024, following the introduction of the E8 Series Shinkansen, all remaining E3-1000 series trains were withdrawn from regular service.

===Formation===
The sets were formed as shown below, with five motored (&quot;M&quot;) cars and two non-powered trailer (&quot;T&quot;) cars, and car 11 at the Tokyo end.

==E3-2000 series==
The first of a fleet of twelve new E3-2000 series 7-car sets entered service on Yamagata Shinkansen &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services on 20 December 2008. The new fleet totally replaced the older 400 series trains by summer 2009. The new trains incorporate design improvements, including active suspension, full-color LED destination indicators, and AC power outlets in all cars. Seating capacity in cars 16 and 17 has been reduced by 4 (one row of seats) compared with the E3-1000 series to provide uniform seating pitch in all cars (seat pitch was previously reduced in non-reserved cars).

===Repainting===

==== Current livery ====

From spring 2014, the entire fleet of 15 E3-1000 and E3-2000 series &quot;Tsubasa&quot; sets were gradually repainted into a new livery designed by industrial designer Ken Okuyama. The new livery consists of white, evoking the snow of Mount Zaō, deep purple inspired by the Mandarin duck, the prefectural bird for Yamagata Prefecture, together with yellow and red for the safflower, the prefectural flower of Yamagata Prefecture. The first repainted set is appeared in late April. Three sets were repainted by June 2014, and the rest of the fleet of 15 sets was repainted by mid 2016.

==== Original livery (2023 revision) ====
On 11 February 2023, set L65 was repainted into the original silver and green livery used at the time of introduction to &quot;Tsubasa&quot; services last seen in 2016. According to JR East, the repainting was done to promote the Yamagata Shinkansen.

==E3-700 series &quot;Toreiyu&quot; excursion set==

This was a six-car set rebuilt from former Akita Shinkansen trainset R18 as an excursion train named for use on the Yamagata Shinkansen between Fukushima and Shinjo, which entered service from July 2014. The design work for the rebuilt train was overseen by industrial designer Ken Okuyama. The six-car set had a total seating capacity of 143 passengers. Car 11 was a standard-class car with reserved seating arranged 2+2 abreast, cars 12 to 14 featured Japanese-style &quot;tatami&quot; seating, car 15 was a lounge car with a bar counter, and car 16 was &quot;ashiyu&quot; foot baths. The name of the train is a portmanteau of the English word &quot;train&quot; and the French word &quot;soleil&quot; (sun). The train was normally used on special &quot;Toreiyu Tsubasa&quot; services running at weekends. The train was discontinued in March 2022.

===Formation===
The &quot;Toreiyu&quot; set was based at Yamagata Depot and formed as shown below, with car 11 at the Fukushima end.

==E3-700 series &quot;Genbi Shinkansen&quot; excursion set==

The was a six-car set rebuilt from former Akita Shinkansen trainset R19 at Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Kobe as an excursion train for use on the Joetsu Shinkansen between and . The train began operations on 29 April 2016, mostly on weekends and holidays. It was withdrawn from service on 19 December 2020.

The exterior livery was designed by photographer Mika Ninagawa. The first car of the six car set featured the art of Nao Matsumoto; a golden yellow motif based on harvests, festivals and light was present in the car. Window shades displayed art using a special dye as the train passes through tunnels. The second car featured stainless steel mirrors on the walls, the work of Yusuke Komuta. They reflect the landscape outside the train. The third car featured a children&#x27;s area and a cafe. The children&#x27;s area featured blue and white representations of toy trains by Art Unit Paramodel. The cafe section of the car was designed by Kentaro Kobuke and served sweet items featuring local products. The fourth car featured an alpine photography exhibition by Naoki Ishikawa. The fifth car featured an abstract flower artpiece by Haruka Koujin that vibrated with the motion of the train. The final car featured a short film by Brian Alfred, depicting the scenery of Niigata. The trainset was shown off to the media on 12 January 2016.

===Formation===
The &quot;Genbi Shinkansen&quot; set was based at Niigata Depot and formed as shown below, with car 11 at the Tokyo end.

Cars 12 and 15 each had one single-arm pantograph.

<doc id="321651" wikidata="Q4952177" url="?curid=321651" title="Boy racer">
<text>Boy racer is a term given to a young person who drives in a fast and aggressive manner; it has become a broader term (often pejorative) for participants in modern custom car culture who tune and modify cars with street racing-style aftermarket cosmetic and performance parts such as body kits, audio systems and exhausts. The culture encompasses a broad range of car types including sport compacts and economy cars typical of the import scene, this is in contrast with the hot rod culture of previous generations. Some car enthusiasts and modifiers feel the term labels them as deviant and anti-social and are keen to distance themselves from the term. Boy racer is a term mostly but not exclusively associated with the UK, in Australia and New Zealand hoon is sometimes preferred. In the US, &quot;Rice boy&quot; or &quot;Ricer&quot; is a derogatory term for the driver or builder of an imported hot rod, or someone who modifies their car in a cheap way to imitate the look of a higher performance vehicle.

Responses to the boy racer phenomenon range from laws prohibiting certain cosmetic modifications to vehicles such as decorative lighting or tinted windows to restrictions on cruising.

==Culture==
Publications for boy racers included &quot;Max Power&quot;, &quot;Fast Car&quot;, &quot;New Zealand Performance Car Magazine&quot;, &quot;MTV&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; and &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; as well as DVD publications and television shows.

==Vehicle modification==
Modifications typically associated with the stereotype include:
* Aftermarket stereos
* Extravagant paint jobs
* Loud exhaust systems
* Aftermarket alloy wheels
* Hellaflush (tyres given excess camber, and scratching the tyre fenders)
* Oversized spoilers and bonnet scoops
* Suspension modifications to lower a car&#x27;s ride height and stiffen ride (often referred to as stance)
* Body kits, neon/L.E.D lights and other appearance modifications
* Tinted windows

==Boy racers by country==
===New Zealand===

The term boy racer is used in New Zealand to describe a youth that drives any form of vehicle that is of high performance or has been modified in any way (including factory fitted parts). The &quot;Land Transport (Unauthorised Street and Drag Racing) Amendment Act 2003&quot; is commonly known as the &quot;Boy Racer Act&quot;. 

In 2009, a government led by the National Party augmented the Act with the &quot;Land Transport (Enforcement Powers) Amendment Act&quot; and the &quot;Sentencing (Vehicle Confiscation) Amendment Act&quot;, which allow police to confiscate and &quot;crush&quot; (correctly, dismantle for saleable parts and destroy the remainder) vehicles on the third offence within four years, issue infringements for &quot;cruising&quot; and prosecute street racing and &quot;antisocial&quot; behaviour, by creating temporary by-laws. The first car crushing sentence was passed down in December 2011. 

The first car to be crushed in accordance with this act was a white Nissan Laurel crushed at a Lower Hutt scrap yard on 21 June 2012 by New Zealand Police Minister of the time Anne Tolley. The crushed Nissan is now on display at Museum of Transport &amp; Technology in Auckland.

While the slang word &quot;bogan&quot; generally has a broader meaning, it is often used in New Zealand in reference to owners of larger Australian cars, like Ford Falcons or Holden Commodores.

Most cheap vehicles in New Zealand are used Japanese imports and the culture follows modification of these cars.

<doc id="321652" wikidata="Q237125" url="?curid=321652" title="Term logic">
<text>In logic and formal semantics, term logic, also known as traditional logic, [[Syllogism|syllogistic logic]] or [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] logic, is a loose name for an approach to formal logic that began with Aristotle and was developed further in ancient history mostly by his followers, the Peripatetics. It was revived after the third century CE by Porphyry&#x27;s Isagoge. 

Term logic revived in medieval times, first in Islamic logic by Alpharabius in the tenth century, and later in Christian Europe in the twelfth century with the advent of new logic, remaining dominant until the advent of predicate logic in the late nineteenth century. 

However, even if eclipsed by newer logical systems, term logic still plays a significant role in the study of logic. Rather than radically breaking with term logic, modern logics typically expand it.

== Aristotle&#x27;s system ==
Aristotle&#x27;s logical work is collected in the six texts that are collectively known as the &quot;Organon&quot;. Two of these texts in particular, namely the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; and &quot;De Interpretatione&quot;, contain the heart of Aristotle&#x27;s treatment of judgements and formal inference, and it is principally this part of Aristotle&#x27;s works that is about term logic. Modern work on Aristotle&#x27;s logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Jan Lukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. Lukasiewicz&#x27;s approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley – which informs modern translations of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009.

The &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; represents the first formal study of logic, where logic is understood as the study of arguments. An argument is a series of true or false statements which lead to a true or false conclusion. In the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, Aristotle identifies valid and invalid forms of arguments called syllogisms. A syllogism is an argument that consists of at least three sentences: at least two premises and a conclusion. Although Aristotle does not call them &quot;categorical sentences&quot;, tradition does; he deals with them briefly in the &quot;Analytics&quot; and more extensively in &quot;On Interpretation&quot;. Each proposition (statement that is a thought of the kind expressible by a declarative sentence) of a syllogism is a categorical sentence which has a subject and a predicate connected by a verb. The usual way of connecting the subject and predicate of a categorical sentence as Aristotle does in &quot;On Interpretation&quot; is by using a linking verb e.g. P is S. However, in the Prior Analytics Aristotle rejects the usual form in favour of three of his inventions: 

*P belongs to S 
*P is predicated of S
*P is said of S 

Aristotle does not explain why he introduces these innovative expressions but scholars conjecture that the reason may have been that it facilitates the use of letters instead of terms avoiding the ambiguity that results in Greek when letters are used with the linking verb. In his formulation of syllogistic propositions, instead of the copula (&quot;All/some... are/are not...&quot;), Aristotle uses the expression, &quot;... belongs to/does not belong to all/some...&quot; or &quot;... is said/is not said of all/some...&quot; There are four different types of categorical sentences: universal affirmative (A), universal negative (E), particular affirmative (I) and particular negative (O).

*A - A belongs to every B
*E - A belongs to no B
*I - A belongs to some B
*O - A does not belong to some B

A method of symbolization that originated and was used in the Middle Ages greatly simplifies the study of the Prior Analytics.
Following this tradition then, let:

:a = belongs to every

:e = belongs to no

:i = belongs to some

:o = does not belong to some

Categorical sentences may then be abbreviated as follows:

:AaB = A belongs to every B (Every B is A)

:AeB = A belongs to no B (No B is A)

:AiB = A belongs to some B (Some B is A)

:AoB = A does not belong to some B (Some B is not A)

From the viewpoint of modern logic, only a few types of sentences can be represented in this way.

== Basics ==
The fundamental assumption behind the theory is that the formal model of propositions are composed of two logical symbols called terms – hence the name &quot;two-term theory&quot; or &quot;term logic&quot; – and that the reasoning process is in turn built from propositions:
*The &quot;term&quot; is a part of speech representing something, but which is not true or false in its own right, such as &quot;man&quot; or &quot;mortal&quot;. As originally conceived, all terms would be drawn from one of ten &quot;categories&quot; enumerated by Aristotle in his &quot;Organon&quot;, classifying all objects and qualities within the domain of logical discourse.
*The formal model of &quot;proposition&quot; consists of two terms, one of which, the &quot;predicate&quot;, is &quot;affirmed&quot; or &quot;denied&quot; of the other, the &quot;subject&quot;, and which is capable of truth or falsity.
*The &quot;syllogism&quot; is an inference in which one proposition (the &quot;conclusion&quot;) follows of necessity from two other propositions (the &quot;premises&quot;).

A proposition may be universal or particular, and it may be affirmative or negative. Traditionally, the four kinds of propositions are:
:* A-type: Universal and affirmative (&quot;All philosophers are mortal&quot;)
:* E-type: Universal and negative (&quot;All philosophers are not mortal&quot;)
:* I-type: Particular and affirmative (&quot;Some philosophers are mortal&quot;)
:* O-type: Particular and negative (&quot;Some philosophers are not mortal&quot;)
This was called the &quot;fourfold scheme&quot; of propositions (see types of syllogism for an explanation of the letters A, I, E, and O in the traditional square). Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;original&quot; square of opposition, however, does not lack existential import.

== Term ==
A term (Greek ὅρος &quot;horos&quot;) is the basic component of the proposition. The original meaning of the &quot;horos&quot; (and also of the Latin &quot;terminus&quot;) is &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;boundary&quot;. The two terms lie on the outside of the proposition, joined by the act of affirmation or denial.

For early modern logicians like Arnauld (whose &quot;Port-Royal Logic&quot; was the best-known text of his day), it is a psychological entity like an &quot;idea&quot; or &quot;concept&quot;. Mill considers it a word. To assert &quot;all Greeks are men&quot; is not to say that the concept of Greeks is the concept of men, or that word &quot;Greeks&quot; is the word &quot;men&quot;. A proposition cannot be built from real things or ideas, but it is not just meaningless words either.

In term logic, a &quot;proposition&quot; is simply a &quot;form of language&quot;: a particular kind of sentence, in which the subject and predicate are combined, so as to assert something true or false. It is not a thought, nor an abstract entity. The word &quot;propositio&quot; is from the Latin, meaning the first premise of a syllogism. Aristotle uses the word premise (&quot;protasis&quot;) as a sentence affirming or denying one thing or another (&quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; 1. 1 24a 16), so a premise is also a form of words.

However, as in modern philosophical logic, it means that which is asserted by the sentence. Writers before Frege and Russell, such as Bradley, sometimes spoke of the &quot;judgment&quot; as something distinct from a sentence, but this is not quite the same. As a further confusion the word &quot;sentence&quot; derives from the Latin, meaning an opinion or judgment, and so is equivalent to &quot;proposition&quot;.

The &quot;logical quality&quot; of a proposition is whether it is affirmative (the predicate is affirmed of the subject) or negative (the predicate is denied of the subject). Thus &quot;every philosopher is mortal&quot; is affirmative, since the mortality of philosophers is affirmed universally, whereas &quot;no philosopher is mortal&quot; is negative by denying such mortality in particular.

The &quot;quantity&quot; of a proposition is whether it is universal (the predicate is affirmed or denied of all subjects or of &quot;the whole&quot;) or particular (the predicate is affirmed or denied of some subject or a &quot;part&quot; thereof). In case where existential import is assumed, quantification implies the existence of at least one subject, unless disclaimed.

== Singular terms ==
For Aristotle, the distinction between singular and universal is a fundamental metaphysical one, and not merely grammatical. A singular term for Aristotle is primary substance, which can only be predicated of itself: (this) &quot;Callias&quot; or (this) &quot;Socrates&quot; are not predicable of any other thing, thus one does not say &quot;every Socrates&quot; one says &quot;every human&quot; (&quot;De Int.&quot; 7; &quot;Meta.&quot; D9, 1018a4). It may feature as a grammatical predicate, as in the sentence &quot;the person coming this way is Callias&quot;. But it is still a &quot;logical&quot; subject.

He contrasts universal (&quot;katholou&quot;) secondary substance, genera, with primary substance, particular (&quot;kath&#x27; hekaston&quot;) specimens. The formal nature of universals, in so far as they can be generalized &quot;always, or for the most part&quot;, is the subject matter of both scientific study and formal logic.

The essential feature of the syllogism is that, of the four terms in the two premises, one must occur twice. Thus

:All Greeks are men
:All men are mortal.

The subject of one premise, must be the predicate of the other, and so it is necessary to eliminate from the logic any terms which cannot function both as subject and predicate, namely singular terms.

However, in a popular 17th-century version of the syllogism, Port-Royal Logic, singular terms were treated as universals:

:All men are mortals
:All Socrates are men
:All Socrates are mortals

This is clearly awkward, a weakness exploited by Frege in his devastating attack on the system.

The famous syllogism &quot;Socrates is a man ...&quot;, is frequently quoted as though from Aristotle, but in fact, it is nowhere in the &quot;Organon&quot;. Sextus Empiricus in his &quot;Hyp. Pyrrh&quot; (Outlines of Pyrronism) ii. 164 first mentions the related syllogism &quot;Socrates is a human being, Every human being is an animal, Therefore, Socrates is an animal.&quot;

=== The three figures ===

Depending on the position of the middle term, Aristotle divides the syllogism into three kinds: syllogism in the first, second, and third figure. If the Middle Term is subject of one premise and predicate of the other, the premises are in the First Figure. If the Middle Term is predicate of both premises, the premises are in the Second Figure. If the Middle Term is subject of both premises, the premises are in the Third Figure.

Symbolically, the Three Figures may be represented as follows:

=== The fourth figure ===
In Aristotelian syllogistic (&quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, Bk I Caps 4-7), syllogisms are divided into three figures according to the position of the middle term in the two premises. The fourth figure, in which the middle term is the predicate in the major premise and the subject in the minor, was added by Aristotle&#x27;s pupil Theophrastus and does not occur in Aristotle&#x27;s work, although there is evidence that Aristotle knew of fourth-figure syllogisms.

== Syllogism in the first figure ==

In the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; translated by A. J. Jenkins as it appears in volume 8 of the Great Books of the Western World, Aristotle says of the First Figure: &quot;... If A is predicated of all B, and B of all C, A must be predicated of all C.&quot; In the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; translated by Robin Smith, Aristotle says of the first figure: &quot;... For if A is predicated of every B and B of every C, it is necessary for A to be predicated of every C.&quot;

Taking &quot;a&quot; = &quot;is predicated of all&quot; = &quot;is predicated of every&quot;, and using the symbolical method used in the Middle Ages, then the first figure is simplified to:

:If AaB
:and BaC
:then AaC.

Or what amounts to the same thing:

:AaB, BaC; therefore AaC

When the four syllogistic propositions, a, e, i, o are placed in the first figure, Aristotle comes up with the following valid forms of deduction for the first figure:

:AaB, BaC; therefore, AaC

:AeB, BaC; therefore, AeC

:AaB, BiC; therefore, AiC

:AeB, BiC; therefore, AoC

In the Middle Ages, for mnemonic reasons they were called &quot;Barbara&quot;, &quot;Celarent&quot;, &quot;Darii&quot; and &quot;Ferio&quot; respectively.

The difference between the first figure and the other two figures is that the syllogism of the first figure is complete while that of the second and third is not. This is important in Aristotle&#x27;s theory of the syllogism for the first figure is axiomatic while the second and third require proof. The proof of the second and third figure always leads back to the first figure.

== Syllogism in the second figure ==

This is what Robin Smith says in English that Aristotle said in Ancient Greek: &quot;... If M belongs to every N but to no X, then neither will N belong to any X. For if M belongs to no X, neither does X belong to any M; but M belonged to every N; therefore, X will belong to no N (for the first figure has again come about).&quot;

The above statement can be simplified by using the symbolical method used in the Middle Ages:

:If MaN
:but MeX
:then NeX.
:For if MeX
:then XeM
:but MaN
:therefore XeN.

When the four syllogistic propositions, a, e, i, o are placed in the second figure, Aristotle comes up with the following valid forms of deduction for the second figure:

:MaN, MeX; therefore NeX

:MeN, MaX; therefore NeX

:MeN, MiX; therefore NoX

:MaN, MoX; therefore NoX

In the Middle Ages, for mnemonic reasons they were called respectively &quot;Camestres&quot;, &quot;Cesare&quot;, &quot;Festino&quot; and &quot;Baroco&quot;.

== Syllogism in the third figure ==

Aristotle says in the Prior Analytics, &quot;... If one term belongs to all and another to none of the same thing, or if they both belong to all or none of it, I call such figure the third.&quot; Referring to universal terms, &quot;... then when both P and R belongs to every S, it results of necessity that P will belong to some R.&quot;

Simplifying:

:If PaS
:and RaS
:then PiR.

When the four syllogistic propositions, a, e, i, o are placed in the third figure, Aristotle develops six more valid forms of deduction:

:PaS, RaS; therefore PiR

:PeS, RaS; therefore PoR

:PiS, RaS; therefore PiR

:PaS, RiS; therefore PiR

:PoS, RaS; therefore PoR

:PeS, RiS; therefore PoR

In the Middle Ages, for mnemonic reasons, these six forms were called respectively: &quot;Darapti&quot;, &quot;Felapton&quot;, &quot;Disamis&quot;, &quot;Datisi&quot;, &quot;Bocardo&quot; and &quot;Ferison&quot;.

== Table of syllogisms ==

== Decline of term logic ==
Term logic began to decline in Europe during the Renaissance, when logicians like Rodolphus Agricola Phrisius (1444–1485) and Ramus (1515–1572) began to promote place logics. The logical tradition called Port-Royal Logic, or sometimes &quot;traditional logic&quot;, saw propositions as combinations of ideas rather than of terms, but otherwise followed many of the conventions of term logic. It remained influential, especially in England, until the 19th century. Leibniz created a distinctive logical calculus, but nearly all of his work on logic remained unpublished and unremarked until Louis Couturat went through the Leibniz &quot;Nachlass&quot; around 1900, publishing his pioneering studies in logic.

19th-century attempts to algebraize logic, such as the work of Boole (1815–1864) and Venn (1834–1923), typically yielded systems highly influenced by the term-logic tradition. The first predicate logic was that of Frege&#x27;s landmark &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (1879), little read before 1950, in part because of its eccentric notation. Modern predicate logic as we know it began in the 1880s with the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, who influenced Peano (1858–1932) and even more, Ernst Schröder (1841–1902). It reached fruition in the hands of Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead, whose &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1910–13) made use of a variant of Peano&#x27;s predicate logic.

Term logic also survived to some extent in traditional Roman Catholic education, especially in seminaries. Medieval Catholic theology, especially the writings of Thomas Aquinas, had a powerfully Aristotelean cast, and thus term logic became a part of Catholic theological reasoning. For example, Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Logic&quot; (1908; 3rd edition 1949), written for use in Catholic seminaries, made no mention of Frege or of Bertrand Russell.

== Revival ==
Some philosophers have complained that predicate logic:
* Is unnatural in a sense, in that its syntax does not follow the syntax of the sentences that figure in our everyday reasoning. It is, as Quine acknowledged, &quot;Procrustean,&quot; employing an artificial language of function and argument, quantifier, and bound variable.
* Suffers from theoretical problems, probably the most serious being empty names and identity statements.

Even academic philosophers entirely in the mainstream, such as Gareth Evans, have written as follows:
:&quot;I come to semantic investigations with a preference for &quot;homophonic&quot; theories; theories which try to take serious account of the syntactic and semantic devices which actually exist in the language ...I would prefer [such] a theory ... over a theory which is only able to deal with [sentences of the form &quot;all A&#x27;s are B&#x27;s&quot;] by &quot;discovering&quot; hidden logical constants ... The objection would not be that such [Fregean] truth conditions are not correct, but that, in a sense which we would all dearly love to have more exactly explained, the syntactic shape of the sentence is treated as so much misleading surface structure&quot; (Evans 1977)

==Boole’s acceptance of Aristotle==

George Boole&#x27;s unwavering acceptance of Aristotle&#x27;s logic is emphasized by the historian of logic John Corcoran in an accessible introduction to &quot;Laws of Thought&quot; Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; and &quot;Laws of Thought&quot;. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle&#x27;s logic. Boole&#x27;s goals were “to go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle&#x27;s logic by:

# providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations;
# extending the class of problems it could treat– from assessing validity to solving equations; and
# expanding the range of applications it could handle– e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.

More specifically, Boole agreed with what Aristotle said; Boole&#x27;s ‘disagreements’, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotle&#x27;s logic to formulas in the form of equations– by itself a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic&#x27;s problems, Boole&#x27;s addition of equation solving to logic– another revolutionary idea –involved Boole&#x27;s doctrine that Aristotle&#x27;s rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole&#x27;s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle&#x27;s system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”.

<doc id="321653" wikidata="Q255160" url="?curid=321653" title="E4 Series Shinkansen">
<text>The was a high-speed Shinkansen electric multiple unit train type operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Japan. They were the second series of completely bi-level Shinkansen trainsets to be built in Japan (the other being the E1 series). They previously operated on the Tōhoku and Jōetsu Shinkansen, and occasionally on the Nagano Shinkansen. E4 series trains feature double-decker cars to accommodate additional commuter traffic around Tokyo and other urban areas. They were often coupled to 400 series trains on the Tōhoku Shinkansen between Tokyo and Fukushima before the latter retired in April 2010 along with the E3 series trains until September 2012. The last trains of the E4 series were withdrawn from regular service on 1 October 2021.

Two eight-car sets can be coupled together for extra capacity: a sixteen-car E4 series formation trainset carries a total of 1,634 seated passengers, the highest-capacity high-speed rail trainset in the world.

26 units were built between 1997 and 2003. As with the earlier E1 series trains, maximum speed was .

==Operations==
E4 series sets were used on the following services.

* Joetsu Shinkansen 
** &quot;Max Asahi&quot; (May 2001 – November 2002)
** &quot;Max Tanigawa&quot; (until 1 October 2021)
** &quot;Max Toki&quot; (until 1 October 2021)
* Tohoku Shinkansen
** &quot;Max Nasuno&quot; (until 28 September 2012)
** &quot;Max Yamabiko&quot; (until 28 September 2012)
* Hokuriku Shinkansen
** &quot;Max Asama&quot; (until 15 September 2003)

==Formation==
Cars 4 and 6 were each equipped with a PS201 pantograph.

==Variants==
Sets P51 and P52, delivered in January and February 2001 were designed to cope with the steep gradients of the Nagano Shinkansen for use on services to Karuizawa.

Sets P81 and P82, delivered in July and November 2003 were designed to cope with the steep gradients of the Nagano Shinkansen, and are also capable of operating under 50 Hz and 60 Hz overhead power supplies for use on services to Nagano.
==Interior==
As with the earlier E1 series, the upper deck saloons of non-reserved cars 1 to 3 were arranged 3+3 with no individual armrests, and did not recline. The lower decks of these cars, and the reserved-seating saloons in cars 4 to 8 had regular 2+3 seating. The green car saloons on the upper decks of cars 7 to 8 had 2+2 seating. The trains had a total seating capacity of 817 passengers.

==History==

The first E4 series set, P1, was delivered to Sendai Depot on 8 October 1997, with the first sets entering revenue-earning service on the Tohoku Shinkansen from 20 December 1997.

All cars were made no-smoking from the start of the revised timetable on 18 March 2007.

In March 2011, it was announced that the entire E4 series fleet would be withdrawn by around 2016.

In September 2012, E4 series were entirely withdrawn from Tohoku Shinkansen services, and all allocated for use on Joetsu Shinkansen services only. The trains were withdrawn from regular service on 1 October 2021, and were completely retired on 17 October of the same year.

==Livery change==

From 2014, the fleet of 24 sets still in service began to be repainted, receiving a new livery identical to that previously carried by the E1 series trains, with a &quot;toki&quot; (crested ibis) pink stripe separating the white on the upper body and blue on the lower body. The first reliveried set, P5, was returned to service in early April 2014, with the entire fleet be treated by the end of fiscal 2015.

==Withdrawals==
Withdrawals started in July 2013, with sets P2 and P3.

==Preserved examples==
End car E444-1 from set P1 is displayed at the Niigata City Niitsu Railway Museum in Niitsu, Niigata. It was moved by road from Niigata Depot to the museum in the early hours of 20 June 2017.

==Fleet list==
The build details are as shown below. All units retired from regular service as of 1 October 2021.

<text>Trojane (; , ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Lukovica in central Slovenia. It lies in the northern part of the Sava Hills, on a hill near the border of two Slovene regions, Carniola and Styria. Until the freeway was finished in 2005, Trojane was on the main route from Ljubljana to Maribor.

==History==
The Romans built a road on the route connecting Aquileia, Emona, Atrans, and Celeia. Trojane was an important , military post, and marketplace, and the town was surrounded by a defensive wall.

The archaeological remains of Atrans can be still seen in Trojane. In the Roman Empire, Trojane (Atrans) was on the border between Italy and the province of Noricum.

==Popular culture==

Trojane is particularly known for the local restaurant&#x27;s jelly doughnuts (), originally made with apricot jam filling.
They also come in blueberry and chocolate flavour.

<doc id="321665" wikidata="Q907579" url="?curid=321665" title="Doctor Yellow">
<text>is the nickname for a series of high-speed diagnostic trains that are used on JR Central&#x27;s Tokaido Shinkansen and JR West&#x27;s San&#x27;yō Shinkansen lines. The trains have special equipment on board to monitor the condition of the track and overhead wires, including special instrumented bogies and observation blisters. Line inspection is carried out at full speed, up to on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen. Doctor Yellow trains make three round trips between and Hakata Station every month. Depending on the day, trains follow the stopping pattern of either Nozomi or Kodama trains. A similar type of diagnostic train called East i is operated by JR East on the Tōhoku Shinkansen.

&quot;Doctor&quot; in the name &quot;Doctor Yellow&quot; refers to their test and diagnostic function, and &quot;Yellow&quot; refers to the bright yellow livery they are painted in. The original color scheme of yellow with a blue stripe (applied to the Class 921 track-recording cars) was created by reversing the colors (blue with yellow stripe) used by track-recording cars on Japan&#x27;s narrow-gauge railways. Some Doctor Yellow sets are painted with a green waistline stripe rather than a blue one. In build and appearance, they resemble the production, passenger-carrying Shinkansen trains they are based on.

Because the schedule for this train is not made public, witnessing a Doctor Yellow in operation is a matter of chance. As a result, seeing one is said to bring the witness good luck or happiness. Railfans have set up websites and social media accounts to predict Doctor Yellow&#x27;s arrival dates and times at stations along the route.

On 13 June 2024, JR Central announced that they would terminate use of Doctor Yellow trains on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen line in January 2025, with plans for farewell events – including commemorative train rides, displays, and souvenirs – to be announced at a later date. At the same time, JR West announced plans to retire their trains after 2027. They are scheduled to be replaced with commercial N700S Series Shinkansen trains that incorporate inspection and observation equipment.

<text>Curcumin is a bright yellow chemical produced by plants of the &quot;Curcuma longa&quot; species. It is the principal curcuminoid of turmeric (&quot;Curcuma longa&quot;), a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is sold as a herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, food flavoring, and food coloring.

Chemically, curcumin is a polyphenol, more particularly a diarylheptanoid, belonging to the group of curcuminoids, which are phenolic pigments responsible for the yellow color of turmeric.

Laboratory and clinical research have not confirmed any medical use for curcumin. It is difficult to study because it is both unstable and poorly bioavailable. It is unlikely to produce useful leads for drug development as a lead compound.

==History==
Curcumin was named in 1815 when Henri Auguste Vogel and Pierre Joseph Pelletier reported the first isolation of a &quot;yellow coloring-matter&quot; from the rhizomes of turmeric. Later, it was found to be a mixture of resin and turmeric oil. In 1910, Milobedzka and Lampe reported the chemical structure of curcumin to be as diferuloylmethane. Later in 1913, the same group accomplished the synthesis of the compound.

Although used in traditional medicine, the possible therapeutic properties of turmeric or curcumin remain undetermined.

==Uses==

The most common applications are as an ingredient in dietary supplement, in cosmetics, as flavoring for foods, such as turmeric-flavored beverages in South and Southeast Asia, and as coloring for foods, such as curry powders, mustards, butters, and cheeses. As a food additive for orange-yellow coloring in prepared foods, its E number is E100 in the European Union. It is also approved by the U.S. FDA to be used as a food coloring in US.

Curcumin is used as a complexometric indicator for boron. It reacts with boric acid to form a red-colored compound, rosocyanine.

== Chemistry ==
Curcumin incorporates a seven carbon linker and three major functional groups: an α,β-unsaturated β-diketone moiety and an aromatic O-methoxy-phenolic group. The aromatic ring systems, which are phenols, are connected by two α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups. It is a diketone tautomer, existing in enolic form in organic solvents and in keto form in water. The diketones form stable enols and are readily deprotonated to form enolates; the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is a good Michael acceptor and undergoes nucleophilic addition. Because of its hydrophobic nature, curcumin is poorly soluble in water but is easily soluble in organic solvents.

===Biosynthesis===
The biosynthetic route of curcumin is uncertain. In 1973, Peter J. Roughley and Donald A. Whiting proposed two mechanisms for curcumin biosynthesis. The first mechanism involves a chain extension reaction by cinnamic acid and 5 malonyl-CoA molecules that eventually arylize into a curcuminoid. The second mechanism involves two cinnamate units coupled together by malonyl-CoA. Both use cinnamic acid as their starting point, which is derived from the amino acid phenylalanine.

Plant biosynthesis starting with cinnamic acid is rare compared to the more common &quot;p&quot;-coumaric acid. Only a few identified compounds, such as anigorufone and pinosylvin, build from cinnamic acid.

==Pharmacology==
Curcumin, which shows positive results in most drug discovery assays, is regarded as a false lead that medicinal chemists include among &quot;pan-assay interference compounds&quot;. This attracts undue experimental attention while failing to advance as viable therapeutic or drug leads, although some derivatives of curcumin such as EF-24 have seen a significant amount of research.

Factors that limit the bioactivity of curcumin or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution, and extensive metabolism. Very little curcumin escapes the GI tract and most is excreted in feces unchanged. If curcumin enters plasma in reasonable amounts, there is a high risk of toxicity since it is promiscuous, and interacts with several proteins known to increase the risk of adverse effects, including hERG, cytochrome P450s, and glutathione S-transferase.

==Safety==
As a component of turmeric, curcumin may interact with prescription drugs and dietary supplements. In high amounts, it may be unsafe for women during pregnancy. It may cause side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, hives, or dizziness. Between 2004 and 2022 there were ten cases of liver injury caused by curcumin herbal and dietary supplements. Curcumin is a contact allergen.

The intended use of curcumin as a food additive is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

==Medical research==
Although curcumin has been assessed in numerous laboratory and clinical studies, it has no medical uses established by well-designed clinical research. According to a 2017 review of more than 120 studies, curcumin has not been successful in any clinical trial, leading the authors to conclude that &quot;curcumin is an unstable, reactive, non-bioavailable compound and, therefore, a highly improbable lead&quot;. Curcumin exhibits numerous interference properties which may lead to misinterpretation of results.

The US government has supported US$150 million in research into curcumin through the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, and no support has been found for curcumin as a medical treatment.

===Research fraud===
Bharat Aggarwal, a former cancer researcher at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had 29 papers retracted due to research fraud . Aggarwal&#x27;s research had focused on potential anti-cancer properties of herbs and spices, particularly curcumin, and according to a March 2016 article in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, &quot;attracted national media interest and laid the groundwork for ongoing clinical trials&quot;. 

Aggarwal cofounded a company in 2004 called Curry Pharmaceuticals based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, which planned to develop drugs based on synthetic analogs of curcumin. SignPath Pharma, a company seeking to develop liposomal formulations of curcumin, licensed three patents by Aggarwal related to that approach from MD Anderson in 2013.

==FDA warnings about dietary supplements==
Between 2018 and 2023, the FDA issued 29 warning letters to American manufacturers of dietary supplements for making false claims of anti-disease effects from using products containing curcumin. In each letter, the FDA stated that the supplement product was not an approved new drug because the &quot;product is not generally recognized as safe and effective&quot; for the advertised uses, that &quot;new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA&quot;, and that the &quot;FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective&quot;.

==Alternative medicine==
Though there is no evidence for the safety or efficacy of using curcumin as a therapy, some alternative medicine practitioners give it intravenously, supposedly as a treatment for numerous diseases. In 2017, two serious cases of adverse events were reported from curcumin or turmeric products—one severe allergic reaction and one death—that were caused by administration of a curcumin-polyethylene glycol (PEG40) emulsion product by a naturopath. One treatment caused anaphylaxis leading to death.

== Stability ==
Decontamination of food by ionizing radiation, or food irradiation, is considered a safe and efficient process for elimination of pathogenic bacteria. Ionizing radiation treatment can be applied to either raw materials or ready to eat foods, with some countries, like the United States, imposing limitations on its use. In 2016, laboratory research established and compared the radiosensitivity of three organic food colorants including curcumin, carmine, and annatto to create data to be used for application whenever food products containing these food colors were to undergo the radiation process. The researchers used spectrophotometry and capillary electrophoresis to establish radiosensitivity of the three organic food colorants. Carmine samples were quite stable against radiation treatment, annatto showed limited stability, and curcumin was found to be unstable, particularly when diluted.

<doc id="321671" wikidata="Q214856" url="?curid=321671" title="Tessellation">
<text>A tessellation or tiling is the covering of a surface, often a plane, using one or more geometric shapes, called &quot;tiles&quot;, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellation can be generalized to higher dimensions and a variety of geometries.

A periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include &quot;regular tilings&quot; with regular polygonal tiles all of the same shape, and &quot;semiregular tilings&quot; with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 wallpaper groups. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called &quot;non-periodic&quot;. An &quot;aperiodic tiling&quot; uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern (an aperiodic set of prototiles). A &quot;tessellation of space&quot;, also known as a space filling or honeycomb, can be defined in the geometry of higher dimensions.

A real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, floor, or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art such as in the Moroccan architecture and decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.

== History ==
Tessellations were used by the Sumerians (about 4000 BC) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.

Decorative mosaic tilings made of small squared blocks called tesserae were widely employed in classical antiquity, sometimes displaying geometric patterns.

In 1619, Johannes Kepler made an early documented study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his ; he was possibly the first to explore and to explain the hexagonal structures of honeycomb and snowflakes.

Some two hundred years later in 1891, the Russian crystallographer Yevgraf Fyodorov proved that every periodic tiling of the plane features one of seventeen different groups of isometries. Fyodorov&#x27;s work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical study of tessellations. Other prominent contributors include Alexei Vasilievich Shubnikov and Nikolai Belov in their book &quot;Colored Symmetry&quot; (1964), and Heinrich Heesch and Otto Kienzle (1963).

=== Etymology ===
In Latin, &quot;tessella&quot; is a small cubical piece of clay, stone, or glass used to make mosaics. The word &quot;tessella&quot; means &quot;small square&quot; (from &quot;tessera&quot;, square, which in turn is from the Greek word τέσσερα for &quot;four&quot;). It corresponds to the everyday term &quot;tiling&quot;, which refers to applications of tessellations, often made of glazed clay.

== Overview ==
Tessellation in two dimensions, also called planar tiling, is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes, known as &quot;tiles&quot;, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are that there must be no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square and the regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.

Many other types of tessellation are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made with more than one kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.

More formally, a tessellation or tiling is a cover of the Euclidean plane by a countable number of closed sets, called &quot;tiles&quot;, such that the tiles intersect only on their boundaries. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from a finite number of prototiles in which all tiles in the tessellation are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to &quot;tessellate&quot; or to &quot;tile the plane&quot;. The Conway criterion is a sufficient, but not necessary, set of rules for deciding whether a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion, but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining whether a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.

Mathematically, tessellations can be extended to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss geometer Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining &quot;polyschemes&quot;, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation to make it easy to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.

Other methods also exist for describing polygonal tilings. When the tessellation is made of regular polygons, the most common notation is the vertex configuration, which is simply a list of the number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 44. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 63.

== In mathematics ==

=== Introduction to tessellations ===
Mathematicians use some technical terms when discussing tilings. An &quot;edge&quot; is the intersection between two bordering tiles; it is often a straight line. A &quot;vertex&quot; is the point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an &quot;isogonal&quot; or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.

The sides of the polygons are not necessarily identical to the edges of the tiles. An edge-to-edge tiling is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side, i.e., no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile. In an edge-to-edge tiling, the sides of the polygons and the edges of the tiles are the same. The familiar &quot;brick wall&quot; tiling is not edge-to-edge because the long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks.

A &quot;normal tiling&quot; is a tessellation for which every tile is topologically equivalent to a disk, the intersection of any two tiles is a connected set or the empty set, and all tiles are uniformly bounded. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius can be used for all the tiles in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.

A is a tessellation in which all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.

An isohedral tiling is a special variation of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles belong to the same transitivity class, that is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the symmetry group of the tiling. If a prototile admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is called anisohedral and forms anisohedral tilings.

A regular tessellation is a highly symmetric, edge-to-edge tiling made up of regular polygons, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.
A semi-regular (or Archimedean) tessellation uses more than one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation is one in which each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.

=== Wallpaper groups ===
Tilings with translational symmetry in two independent directions can be categorized by wallpaper groups, of which 17 exist. It has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Although this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings have interested modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the &quot;p6m&quot; wallpaper group and one is in &quot;p4m&quot;. Tilings in 2-D with translational symmetry in just one direction may be categorized by the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation can be used to describe wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane.

=== Aperiodic tilings ===

Penrose tilings, which use two different quadrilateral prototiles, are the best known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated in this way is the rep-tiles; these tilings have unexpected self-replicating properties. Pinwheel tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so. Aperiodic tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with aperiodic order.

Wang tiles are squares coloured on each edge, and placed so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles have the same colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented as a set of Wang dominoes that tile the plane if, and only if, the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.

Truchet tiles are square tiles decorated with patterns so they do not have rotational symmetry; in 1704, Sébastien Truchet used a square tile split into two triangles of contrasting colours. These can tile the plane either periodically or randomly.

An &quot;einstein tile&quot; is a single shape that forces aperiodic tiling. The first such tile, dubbed a &quot;hat&quot;, was discovered in 2023 by David Smith, a hobbyist mathematician. The discovery is under professional review and, upon confirmation, will be credited as solving a longstanding mathematical problem.

=== Tessellations and colour ===


Sometimes the colour of a tile is understood as part of the tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity, one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape, but different colours, are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring that does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as demonstrated in the image at left.

=== Tessellations with polygons ===
Next to the various tilings by regular polygons, tilings by other polygons have also been studied.

Any triangle or quadrilateral (even non-convex) can be used as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, often in more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.
If only one shape of tile is allowed, tilings exist with convex &quot;N&quot;-gons for &quot;N&quot; equal to 3, 4, 5, and 6. For , see Pentagonal tiling, for , see Hexagonal tiling, for , see Heptagonal tiling and for , see octagonal tiling.

With non-convex polygons, there are far fewer limitations in the number of sides, even if only one shape is allowed.

Polyominoes are examples of tiles that are either convex of non-convex, for which various combinations, rotations, and reflections can be used to tile a plane. For results on tiling the plane with polyominoes, see Polyomino § Uses of polyominoes.

=== Voronoi tilings ===

Voronoi or Dirichlet tilings are tessellations where each tile is defined as the set of points closest to one of the points in a discrete set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points closest to a given city or post office.) The &quot;Voronoi cell&quot; for each defining point is a convex polygon. The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is the dual graph of a Voronoi tessellation. Delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation, in part because among all possible triangulations of the defining points, Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum of the angles formed by the edges. Voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of the plane.

=== Tessellations in higher dimensions ===

Tessellation can be extended to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion is known as a plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.
Tessellations in three or more dimensions are called honeycombs. In three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform honeycombs can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.

The Schmitt-Conway biprism is a convex polyhedron with the property of tiling space only aperiodically.

A Schwarz triangle is a spherical triangle that can be used to tile a sphere.

=== Tessellations in non-Euclidean geometries ===

It is possible to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (that may be regular, quasiregular, or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).

A uniform honeycomb in hyperbolic space is a uniform tessellation of uniform polyhedral cells. In three-dimensional (3-D) hyperbolic space there are nine Coxeter group families of compact convex uniform honeycombs, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams for each family.

== In art ==

In architecture, tessellations have been used to create decorative motifs since ancient times. Mosaic tilings often had geometric patterns. Later civilisations also used larger tiles, either plain or individually decorated. Some of the most decorative were the Moorish wall tilings of Islamic architecture, using Girih and Zellige tiles in buildings such as the Alhambra and La Mezquita.

Tessellations frequently appeared in the graphic art of M. C. Escher; he was inspired by the Moorish use of symmetry in places such as the Alhambra when he visited Spain in 1936. Escher made four &quot;Circle Limit&quot; drawings of tilings that use hyperbolic geometry. For his woodcut &quot;Circle Limit IV&quot; (1960), Escher prepared a pencil and ink study showing the required geometry. Escher explained that &quot;No single component of all the series, which from infinitely far away rise like rockets perpendicularly from the limit and are at last lost in it, ever reaches the boundary line.&quot;
Tessellated designs often appear on textiles, whether woven, stitched in, or printed. Tessellation patterns have been used to design interlocking motifs of patch shapes in quilts.

Tessellations are also a main genre in origami (paper folding), where pleats are used to connect molecules, such as twist folds, together in a repeating fashion.

== In manufacturing ==
Tessellation is used in manufacturing industry to reduce the wastage of material (yield losses) such as sheet metal when cutting out shapes for objects such as car doors or drink cans.

Tessellation is apparent in the mudcrack-like cracking of thin films – with a degree of self-organisation being observed using micro and nanotechnologies.

== In nature ==

The honeycomb is a well-known example of tessellation in nature with its hexagonal cells.

In botany, the term &quot;tessellate&quot; describes a checkered pattern, for example on a flower petal, tree bark, or fruit. Flowers including the fritillary, and some species of &quot;Colchicum&quot;, are characteristically tessellate.

Many patterns in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns can be described by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model for the formation of mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from being randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.

Other natural patterns occur in foams; these are packed according to Plateau&#x27;s laws, which require minimal surfaces. Such foams present a problem in how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin&#x27;s foam.

== In puzzles and recreational mathematics ==

Tessellations have given rise to many types of tiling puzzle, from traditional jigsaw puzzles (with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard) and the tangram, to more modern puzzles that often have a mathematical basis. For example, polyiamonds and polyominoes are figures of regular triangles and squares, often used in tiling puzzles. Authors such as Henry Dudeney and Martin Gardner have made many uses of tessellation in recreational mathematics. For example, Dudeney invented the hinged dissection, while Gardner wrote about the &quot;rep-tile&quot;, a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the same shape. Inspired by Gardner&#x27;s articles in Scientific American, the amateur mathematician Marjorie Rice found four new tessellations with pentagons. Squaring the square is the problem of tiling an integral square (one whose sides have integer length) using only other integral squares. An extension is squaring the plane, tiling it by squares whose sizes are all natural numbers without repetitions; James and Frederick Henle proved that this was possible.

<text>Assück was an American grindcore band from Saint Petersburg, Florida, active from 1987 to 1998.

== History ==
Assück was founded by vocalist Paul Pavlovich and guitarist Steve Heritage. The band went through several line-up changes, in particular changing vocalists four times. Despite these changes, Assück maintained its heavy and fast sound — and anarchist sensibilities — from its first release to its last.

== Legacy and reception ==
The band proved influential, with their album &quot;Anticapital&quot; (1991) voted number 4 in the &quot;Terrorizer&quot; list of their top 20 US grindcore albums; &quot;Terrorizer&quot; described it as a &quot;low-calibre battery of brooding, malicious, doom-ridden grind pitched somewhere between early Napalm Death and even earlier Bolt Thrower&quot;.

According to journalist Greg Pratt, &quot;Assück were an incredible band with probably metal&#x27;s best drummer [Rob Proctor], although no one ever mentions his name. They combined well-written poetic and political lyrics with catchy songs, insane musicianship and a short-fast-loud brutality that no one has topped since.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot;, Felix von Havoc describes the political punk and metal roots of this band, stating &quot;Assuck managed to combine the anger, fury and social commentary of a punk band with the musicianship and production quality of a Death Metal band.&quot;

;Timeline
===Paul Pavlovich===
Paul Pavlovich (born March 3, 1970) is an American artist, graphic designer, and musician. Currently living in St. Petersburg, Florida, he is best known as the first lead singer for Assück, which he co-founded in 1987. In October 2008, IGN Entertainment named Pavlovich one of the &#x27;10 Best Death Metal Singers&#x27; stating &quot;In terms of the guys doing the deeper or what some fans call &quot;guttural&quot; vocal style, Pavlovich is in an elite class.&quot;

Since his departure from the band in 1992, Pavlovich shifted his attention to visual art and design. After graduating from the Ringling School of Art and Design in 1994, Pavlovich spent a period of time in New York City developing his unique system of painting and image making. During his short residence in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York Pavlovich spent several months rehearsing with the band Cattle Press (Hydra Head Records).

Pavlovich returned to the Tampa Bay Area with a developed body of artwork which he began showing in group shows. In 2002 Pavlovich was selected to show several works at the Tampa Museum of Art. In 2004 Pavlovich was approached by curator Timothy Warner of the Covivant Gallery in Tampa who was interested in organizing Pavlovich&#x27;s first solo exhibit of work entitled &quot;Temporary Past Life&quot; which received praise from national and local media. Pavlovich continues his visual work which has been widely seen in both print and web-media.

In late 2004, Pavlovich was asked by longtime friend and guitarist Sam Williams to contribute vocals to a recording project called Track the Curse. In 2006, the album &quot;The New Land&quot; was released by the Tennessee label Spins Good Records, and in 2007, &quot;They&#x27;ve Taken Everything&quot; (VA CD; Profane Existence).

Pavlovich appeared as a guest vocalist on the 2014 album, &quot;Longhena&quot;, by technical grindcore band Gridlink, contributing on the track &quot;Chalk Maple&quot;.

In 2018, Pavlovich founded his own label called Roman Numeral Records, and also formed a new grindcore band called Alphanumeric, whose debut EP was released in 2019 through Roman Numeral.

<doc id="321686" wikidata="Q1159593" url="?curid=321686" title="Ménage à trois">
<text>A  () is a domestic arrangement or committed relationship consisting of three people in polyamorous romantic or sexual relations with each other, and often dwelling together. The phrase is a loan from French meaning &quot;household of three&quot;. Contemporary arrangements are sometimes identified as a throuple, thruple, or triad.

==Terminology==
This relationship type usually has elements of bisexuality involved, but occasionally at least one of the participants is heterosexual, homosexual or asexual. Because this term is sometimes interchangeably used for a threesome, which solely refers to a sexual experience involving three people, it can sometimes be misrepresented as some type of casual encounter. However, the &quot;ménage à trois&quot; is a specific type of committed relationship, in which vows are often made. It does not apply to all polyamorous relationships with three individuals, since polyamory can have many different forms.

The topic sometimes overlaps seemingly opposing concepts such as Christian feminism and lesbian feminism. These ideas were explored by film maker Angela Robinson in her film &quot;Professor Marston and the Wonder Women&quot; through the love story of historical couple William Moulton Marston and Elizabeth Holloway Marston with their research assistant Olive Byrne.

Both the term and way of life have become a topic of discussion in areas associated with Christendom and Romance languages.

==Examples==
===Ancient history===
Traditional ideas of the Abrahamic faiths and Christian views on marriage are prevalent in literature and media discussing this topic. Patriarchs Abraham and Sarah had an arrangement with Sarah&#x27;s handmaiden Hagar. Interpretations of this vary, for example Judaism and Islam treat it much more like a polygamous situation, whereas Christian sources sometimes discuss the love triangle aspect of it, which are not directly analogous with a ménage à trois. Similarly when Jacob married Leah and Rachel, the polygamy and love triangle perspectives are well researched compared to the ménage à trois.

Sappho&#x27;s writings influenced the early Christian church, and the topic of lesbianism within the ménage à trois framework of Christian couples began to be explored in post-Renaissance literature within Christian media.

=== Post-Renaissance history ===

Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna, regent of Russia from 1740 to 1741, was involved simultaneously in affairs with the Saxon ambassador Count Moritz zu Lynar and her lady-in-waiting Mengden. The regent&#x27;s relationship with Mengden caused much disgust in Russia, and many believed her preoccupation with her relationships with Lynar and Mengden at the expense of governing made her a danger to the state. She was later overthrown in a coup.

In his youth, thirteen years her junior, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) was a protégé of the French noblewoman Françoise-Louise de Warens, who would become his first lover. He lived with her at her estate on and off since his teenage years, and in 1732, after he reached the age of 20, she initiated a sexual relationship with him while also being open about her sexual involvement with the steward of her house.

The German intellectual Dorothea von Rodde-Schlözer (1770–1825), her husband Mattheus Rodde and the French philosopher Charles de Villers also had a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; from 1794 until her husband&#x27;s death in 1810.

The British Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758–1805) was in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; with his lover Emma, Lady Hamilton, and her husband William Hamilton, the British ambassador to Naples, from 1799 until Nelson&#x27;s death in 1805.

At the age of 16, in 1813, the future author of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Mary Godwin (1797–1851), eloped with her to-be husband Percy Bysshe Shelley and engaged in a &quot;ménage&quot; with Claire Clairmont, future lover of Lord Byron, with whom the Shelleys would later have an extensive relationship.

The Italian composer Luigi Ricci (1805–1859) married Ludmila Stolz, while still maintaining a relationship with her identical twin sister Francesca. He had a child with each.

The political philosopher Friedrich Engels (1820–1895) lived in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; with his mistress Mary Burns and her sister Lizzie.

The Belgian artist/illustrator Félicien Rops (1833–1898) maintained a remarkable ménage à trois with two sisters, Aurélie and Léontine Dulac, who ran a successful fashion house in Paris, &quot;Maison Dulac&quot;. They each bore a child with him (one died at an early age) and they lived together for over 25 years until his death.

The author E. Nesbit (1858–1924) lived with her husband Hubert Bland and his mistress Alice Hoatson, and raised their children as her own.

In 1913, psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875–1961) began a relationship with a young patient, Toni Wolff, which lasted for some decades. Deirdre Bair, in her biography of Carl Jung, describes his wife Emma Jung as bearing up nobly as her husband insisted that Toni Wolff become part of their household, saying that Wolff was &quot;his other wife&quot;.

The Russian and Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893–1930) lived with Lilya Brik, who was considered his muse, and her husband Osip Brik, an &quot;avant garde&quot; writer and critic.

The English poet, novelist and critic Robert Graves (1895–1985) and his wife Nancy Nicholson for some years attempted a triadic relationship called &quot;The Trinity&quot; with Laura Riding, a woman that Graves met and fell in love with in 1926. This triangle became the &quot;Holy Circle&quot; with the addition of Irish poet Geoffrey Phibbs, who himself was still married to Irish artist Norah McGuinness.

As recounted by the author and journalist Arthur Koestler (1905–1983) in &quot;The Invisible Writing&quot;, a conspicuous fixture of the intellectual life of 1930s Budapest was a threesome—a husband, his wife and the wife&#x27;s lover—who were writers and literary critics and had the habit of every day spending many hours, the three of them together, at one of the Hungarian capital&#x27;s well known cafes. As noted by Koestler, their relationship was so open and lasted so many years that it became no longer the subject of gossip.

The Italian surrealist artist Leonor Fini (1907–1996) sustained a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; until her death with Italian Count Stanislao Lepri and Polish writer Konstanty Jelenski in Paris. The relationship is believed to have impacted Fini&#x27;s work, as she depicts gender neutral individuals or figures where traditional gender roles are reversed with a passive male and dominant female, such as &quot;Woman Seated on Naked Man (1942)&quot;.

The writer Aldous Huxley (1894–1963) and his first wife Maria engaged in a &quot;ménage&quot; with Mary Hutchinson, a friend of Clive Bell. Huxley coined the term &quot;&quot;, referring to bisexuality.

From 1939, the Nobel Prize winning German physicist Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961), his wife, Annemarie Bertel, and his mistress, Hilde March, had a &quot;ménage à trois&quot;.

Charles Moulton, the creator of Wonder Woman, lived with two women, his wife Elizabeth Holloway Marston, and Olive Byrne, until he died. Marston had two children with each. Elizabeth supported the family financially while Olive stayed home to take care of all four children.

In 1963, the actress Hattie Jacques (1922–1980) lived with her husband John Le Mesurier and her lover John Schofield.

Some 21st-century examples of notable triads include Seven Lions, who lives with his wife Emma and their girlfriend Courtney Simmons; Bella Thorne, who was publicly in a throuple with rapper Mod Sun and influencer Tana Mongeau from 2017 to 2019; and Frankie Grande, a gay actor, describes living in a gay triad. According to a study conducted by dating app Tinder, data has shown that Generation Z is actually more concerned with open-mindedness than looks. Per the report, &quot;they would rather date someone who is open to trying new relationship styles than someone who looks pretty&quot;.

===Cultural influence===
Folie à Deux winery has a popular set of wines labeled as Ménage à Trois.

In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; TV series, season 6, episode 11, titled &quot;The Switch,&quot; Jerry and George use this term as they devise a solution to address challenges in their relationships with women.

Wonder Woman is based on two women that were in a real life ménage à trois, as featured in &quot;Professor Marston and the Wonder Women&quot;, the creator of the comic, William Moulton Marston, and his legal wife, Elizabeth Holloway Marston, had a polyamorous life partner, Olive Byrne.

<doc id="321687" wikidata="Q38155" url="?curid=321687" title="Nasal bone">
<text>The nasal bones are two small oblong bones, varying in size and form in different individuals; they are placed side by side at the middle and upper part of the face and by their junction, form the bridge of the upper one third of the nose.

Each has two surfaces and four borders.

==Structure==
There is heavy variation in the structure of the nasal bones, accounting for the differences in sizes and shapes of the nose seen across different people. Angles, shapes, and configurations of both the bone and cartilage are heavily varied between individuals. Broadly, most nasal bones can be categorized as &quot;V-shaped&quot; or &quot;S-shaped&quot; but these are not scientific or medical categorizations. When viewing anatomical drawings of these bones, consider that they are unlikely to be accurate for a majority of people.

The two nasal bones are joined at the midline internasal suture and make up the bridge of the nose.

=== Surfaces ===
The &quot;outer surface&quot; is from above downward, convex from side to side; it is covered by the procerus and nasalis muscles, and perforated about its center by the nasal foramen, a small passageway for the transmission of a small vein from the overlying soft tissues.

The &quot;inner surface&quot; is concave from side to side, and is traversed from above downward, by a groove for the passage of a branch of the nasociliary nerve.

=== Articulations ===
The nasal articulates with four bones: two of the cranium, the frontal and ethmoid, and two of the face, the opposite nasal and the maxilla.

==Other animals==
In primitive bony fish and tetrapods, the nasal bones are the most anterior of a set of four paired bones forming the roof of the skull, being followed in sequence by the frontals, the parietals, and the postparietals. Their form in living species is highly variable, depending on the shape of the head, but they generally form the roof of the snout or beak, running from the nostrils to a position short of the orbits. In most animals, they are generally therefore proportionally larger than in humans or great apes, because of the shortened faces of the latter. Turtles, unusually, lack nasal bones, with the prefrontal bones of the orbit reaching all the way to the nostrils.

<text>Phelsuma pronki, also known as Pronk&#x27;s day gecko, is a critically endangered diurnal species of gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to central Madagascar, and threatened by severe habitat loss and collection for the international pet trade. It typically inhabits rainforests, dwells on trees, and feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;pronki&quot;, is in honor of Dutch naturalist Olaf Pronk.

==Description==
P. pronki belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a total length (including tail) of about . The body colour is greyish, and the head is yellow. Four serrated black stripes extend from the snout to the tail. The extremities are blackish with grey speckles. A yellow eye ring is present.

==Geographic range==
P. pronki inhabits the rainforest of the highland of central Madagascar near Andramasina.

==Habitat==
The habitat of &quot;Phelsuma pronki&quot; is rainy and very moist. There is a huge difference in temperature between night and day and between the different seasons. During the colder months, the temperature can be as low as at night, yet over during the day.

==Diet==
P. pronki feeds on various insects, other invertebrates, and nectar.

==Reproduction==
The females of &quot;P. pronki&quot; glue their eggs under loose bark.

==Captivity==
This critically endangered species is still wild-caught for the international pet trade. It can be captive-bred by experts.

&quot;Phelsuma pronki&quot; should be housed in pairs and need a well-planted terrarium which should provide many places to hide. It is important that there are some spot lights for basking. The daytime temperature should be around , while at night the temperature should drop to . The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

<text>Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell (15 June 1792 – 5 October 1855), often called Major Mitchell, was a Scottish surveyor and explorer of Southeastern Australia. He was born in Scotland and served in the British Army during the Peninsular War. In 1827 he took up an appointment as Assistant Surveyor General of New South Wales. The following year he became Surveyor General and remained in this position until his death. Mitchell was knighted in 1839 for his contribution to the surveying of Australia.

== Early life ==
Thomas Livingstone Mitchell was born at Grangemouth in Stirlingshire, Scotland on 15 June 1792. He was son of John Mitchell of Carron Works and was brought up from childhood by his uncle, Thomas Livingstone of Parkhall, Stirlingshire. The antiquarian John Mitchell Mitchell was his brother.

== Peninsular War ==

On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer in the Peninsular War, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). 

Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General&#x27;s department under Sir George Murray. He was present at the storming of the fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajos and San Sebastian as well as the battles of Salamanca and the Pyrenees. Subsequently, he would receive the Military General Service Medal with bars for each of these engagements.

When the war was over, Mitchell was selected to reside in Spain and Portugal for four years to complete sketches of the battlefields for the Military Depot. His duties also included conducting several other important surveys which had been impossible to finish whilst operations were in progress in the field. On 10 June 1818, during this posting, Mitchell married Mary Blunt (daughter of General Richard Blunt (d. 25 December 1859) in Lisbon and gained promotion to a company in the 54th Regiment.

In the summer of 1819, he returned to Britain where he devoted himself to finishing the drawings, but with the cessation of the government allowances he had to stop this work. The reductions in the military establishment which followed the withdrawing of the Army of Occupation from France forced Mitchell on to half-pay. It was not until much later, while Mitchell was in London between 1838 and 1840, that the work was completed. The finished drawings were published by the London geographer James Wyld in 1841 under the title &quot;Atlas containing the principle battles, sieges and affairs of the Peninsular War&quot;. Of high quality, the drawings are the prime source for the topography of the war.

== New South Wales ==
In 1827, with the support of Sir George Murray, Mitchell became Assistant Surveyor General of New South Wales with the right to succeed John Oxley. Oxley died the following year, and on 27 May 1828, Mitchell became Surveyor General. In this post he did much to improve the quality and accuracy of surveying – a vital task in a colony where huge tracts of land were being opened up and sold to new settlers. One of the first roads surveyed under his leadership was the Great North Road, built by convict labour between 1826 and 1836 linking Sydney to the Hunter Valley. The Great South Road (now replaced by the Hume Highway), also convict-built, linked Sydney and Goulburn. He kept a record of his &#x27;Progress in roads and Public Works in New South Wales to 1855&#x27;, including sketches and plans of Sydney, Emu Plains, the Blue Mountains, Victoria Pass, roads to Bathurst, Wisemans Ferry, and indigenous Australians.

As Surveyor General, Mitchell also completed maps and plans of Sydney, including Darling Point, Point Piper, the city, and Port Jackson. In 1834 he was commissioned to survey a map of the Nineteen Counties. The map he produced was done with such skill and accuracy that he was awarded a knighthood. Around this time, a portrait of Mitchell was painted showing him in the uniform of Major of the 1st Rifle Brigade of the 95th Regiment, complete with whistle used to direct the movement of troops.

During his tenure in New South Wales, Mitchell led four extensive and historically significant surveying expeditions into the interior of eastern Australia.

===First expedition===
In 1831, a runaway convict named George &quot;The Barber&quot; Clarke (a monument to whom exists at Barber&#x27;s Lagoon near Boggabri and who had lived with the Kamilaroi people in the area for several years) claimed that a large river called Kindur flowed north-west from the Liverpool Ranges in New South Wales to the sea. Charles Sturt believed that the Murray-Darling system formed the main river system of New South Wales and Mitchell wanted to prove Sturt wrong. Mitchell formed an expedition consisting of himself, assistant surveyor George Boyle White and 15 convicts who were promised remission for good conduct. Mitchell took 20 bullocks, three heavy drays, three light carts and nine horses to carry supplies, and set out on 24 November 1831 to investigate the claim. On reaching Wollombi in the Hunter Valley, the local assistant surveyor, Heneage Finch, expressed a desire to join the expedition which Mitchell approved, provided he first obtain extra provisions and rendezvous later.

The expedition continued northward, and having climbed the Liverpool Range on 5 December, they found an Aboriginal tribe who had fled from their home in the Hunter Valley and were suffering from what appeared to be smallpox. On 8 December they arrived at Quirindi and by 11 December the expedition had reached Wallamoul Station near Tamworth, the northern extent of white settlement at the time.

Mitchell continued his northward push into uncolonised territory, guided by a local Gamilaraay man named &quot;Mr. Brown&quot;. In mid-December, near to where Boggabri now stands, they located the remains of a stockyard and huts built by George Clarke and his Aboriginal colleagues. By early January 1832 Mitchell&#x27;s group was travelling along the Namoi River, by which stage Mr Brown had left them. Mitchell&#x27;s party then headed north unguided but managed to reach the Gwydir River in mid-January where they found a small Aboriginal village of conical-roofed huts. They followed the Gwydir west and made it to the Barwon River by the end of the month. Mitchell came to the correct conclusion that the Barwon flowed into the Darling River and decided not to proceed any further.

At this stage, Finch had finally caught up with the main group. Finch conveyed the news that the provisions he had obtained had been ransacked by Aboriginal people at Gurley. Two men he had left to guard the supplies had also been killed. The immediate effect was that Mitchell decided to abandon the expedition and return south. The party retraced their path having tense but peaceful interactions with large groups of Gamilaraay people along the way. They reached Gorolei on 18 February where Mitchell buried the bodies of the two killed men and salvaged some equipment. Aboriginal people approached the group laying down their spears and offering females to Mitchell&#x27;s men in an apparent attempt at appeasement for the killings. Mitchell refused the offer but accepted their guidance on an easy way back to the Namoi River. Once back at Wallamoul, Mitchell placed White in charge of the main party, while he returned hastily to Sydney. He was satisfied that there was no truth about the river Kindur claimed by Clarke. Fourteen years later, Mitchell revealed that the convicts had indulged in sexual relations with Aboriginal women.

=== Second expedition ===
Mitchell&#x27;s next expedition was in 1835. The purpose was to explore the course of the Darling River from where Sturt had turned back in 1829, to where it joined the Murray River. There were 24 men in the party including Mitchell, James Larmer (assistant surveyor) as second in command, Richard Cunningham (colonial botanist) and 21 other men. The main party under Larmer left Parramatta on 9 March and rendezvoused with Mitchell at Boree near the township of Orange. From there, the expedition was guided through the Goobang Ranges by local Wiradjuri people toward the Bogan River. On 17 April 1835, Richard Cunningham wandered away from the party while looking for botanical specimens and went missing. The party, with the assistance of various local Aboriginal people, searched for him until 5 May, following Cunningham&#x27;s tracks around the headwaters of the Bogan until they disappeared. Cunningham&#x27;s dead horse, saddle, glove and fragments of his coat and map were all they found. Months later, a search party of military mounted police commanded by Lieutenant Henry Zouch of the first division, discovered that Cunningham had been killed by four Wiradjuri men and his bones were found and buried at Currindine.

After the fruitless search for Cunningham, Mitchell decided to continue the expedition. He was assisted by a local unnamed elder who provided a guide called Tackijally. This man led Mitchell downstream along the waterholes adjacent to the Bogan River as far as Nyngan. Tackijally left them at this point and the group was soon involved in a brief confrontation after they startled an Aboriginal man at a waterhole. The man, who was shot in the hand, had his wounds dressed by the group and later departed. They proceeded down the Bogan, encountering several gatherings of people to which Mitchell gave tomahawks and pieces of an old sword. On 25 May the junction with the Darling River was reached. Here, on a high point of land which bore many Aboriginal grave sites, Mitchell decided to build a fort as he realised that they &quot;had not asked permission to come there&quot; and he needed a stockade for &quot;stout resistance against any number of natives.&quot; He named it Fort Bourke in honour of the Governor, Richard Bourke.
Two whale boats had been transported the whole distance on bullock drays and on 1 June Mitchell launched the boats on the Darling to transport the party downriver. However, the Darling became shallower and unnavigable resulting in the expedition resorting once again to overland progress. They encountered many tribes as they headed south, with Mitchell documenting the agricultural practices of some, such as the harvesting of &quot;Panicum decompositum&quot;, and the large permanent dwellings of others. One clan appeared more hostile than others, kicking up dust and spitting at party members. Mitchell acknowledged that his group were &quot;rather unceremonious invaders of their country&quot; but inflamed tensions by firing a pistol at a tree. Mitchell wrote that &quot;the more they saw of our superior weapons...the more they shewed their hatred and tokens of defiance.&quot; The party continued downriver, meeting with friendlier locals, passing through villages and noting the construction of their tomb-sites.
Just north of the Menindee Lakes, the expedition came across a large congregation of several tribes and Mitchell decided that continuing the exploration would be too dangerous. On 11 July, just as Mitchell had resolved to return to Sydney, shots were heard from a forage party up the river. Mitchell sent a further three armed men to the scene of the shooting and the firing continued. After more than an hour, some members of the group returned reporting that a skirmish had occurred over the possession of a kettle and at least three Aboriginal people had been shot dead, including a woman and her child. One of Mitchell&#x27;s men had been knocked unconscious. The party then commenced their return via the outbound route with Mitchell deciding to avoid contact with the various tribes as much as possible. The &quot;spitting tribe&quot; attempted to burn down their camp on this return journey which resulted in Mitchell ordering shots to be fired over their heads. They arrived at Fort Bourke on 10 August and continued back along the Bogan River. Near Nyngan they met again with members of Tackijally&#x27;s tribe who allowed Mitchell to walk through their cemetery at Milmeridien. Mitchell soon tired of the clan asking for food and ordered some of his men to march at them with bayonets. On 9 September they came to the upper reaches of the Bogan where they found a cattle-station had already been formed along their route by William Lee. The expedition arrived back at their starting point of Boree on 14 September.

While Mitchell did not trace the Darling River to its junction with the Murray River, the course and terrain of the Bogan River and much of the Darling River had been charted. The places where this and other Mitchell expeditions were most assailed by Aboriginal Australians, including the location of Cunningham&#x27;s killing, are marked on an 1836 map produced by Mitchell.

=== Third expedition ===

The goal of Mitchell&#x27;s third expedition was to explore and survey the lower part of the Darling River, with instructions to head up the Murray River and then return to the settled areas around Yass. Second in command was assistant surveyor Granville Stapylton. A Wiradjuri man named John Piper was also recruited and 23 convicts and ticket of leave men made up the rest of the party. The group set out from a valley near Mount Canobolas on 17 March 1836, and made their way to Boree and the Bogan River as on previous journeys, then veered south to the Kalare or Lachlan River to approach the Darling from its southern end where it joined the Murray.

The party was guided by various Aboriginal people such as &quot;Barney&quot; along the Lachlan, passing Lake Cargelligo, as John Oxley did in 1817. At this place they met with a large clan from which a number of people joined the expedition and gave vital information about waterholes, as the Lachlan was drying out. Piper also obtained a &quot;good, strong woman&quot; from this tribe. 
On 2 May they arrived at Combedyega where an Aboriginal widow named Turandurey with her four-year-old daughter Ballandella also joined the expedition as a guide. She remembered Oxley from nineteen years earlier and Sturt as well, and knew the lower Lachlan. The Murrumbidgee River was reached on 12 May, but at a point downstream from the junction with the Lachlan.

====Mount Dispersion massacre====

They continued down the Murrumbidgee until 21 May when they were close to the junction with the Murray River. A depot was established at this point, and Mitchell left Staplyton with eight men to guard the stock, while he ventured downstream with the rest of the group. According to the account given to a later enquiry by William Muirhead (bullock-driver and sergeant), Alexander Burnett (overseer) and Jemmy Piper (Aboriginal man accompanying the party): on 24 May Mitchell noticed that Barkindji tribesmen from the Darling River were gathering in large numbers, and by 27 May the hostile intentions of these men became known, when local Murray River people told Piper that the Barkindji were planning to kill Mitchell and his men. Mitchell had to decide whether to wait for an attack, or plan a pre-emptive manoeuvre. His numbers were reduced, as Staplyton and eight men were still at the depot. He split his party again, leaving half the men to hide in the scrub in ambush, while he continued ahead with the carts. When the armed Barkindji warriors approached, the convict Charles King, who was involved in the earlier killings, fired first without waiting for orders. The tribesmen fled into the river and Mitchell&#x27;s two groups reunited on the shore and continued to shoot at the people for up to 15 minutes. Around 75 shots were fired with Piper later being told that seven Barkindji were killed and four wounded.

Mitchell wrote about the loss of life in his journal, describing the Barkindji as &quot;treacherous savages&quot;, and detailing how his men had chased them away, &quot;pursuing and shooting as many as they could&quot;. This section was withheld from Mitchell&#x27;s report when it was released to the public in Sydney. Mitchell named the hill near to where the mass-shooting occurred Mount Dispersion and in May 2020 it was heritage-listed as the Mount Dispersion Massacre Site Aboriginal Place.

====Onwards====
The expedition continued down the Murray River, encountering a major Aboriginal grave-site at Red Cliffs. On 31 May they arrived close to the junction of the Murray with a &quot;green and stagnant&quot; waterway. Local people advised Piper that this was the Darling River. Mitchell did not believe it, and only when he travelled upstream for some distance, coming across the same type of burial mounds that he had seen in 1835, did he acknowledge that &quot;this hopeless river&quot; was the Darling. He turned back and headed upstream on the Murray to rejoin Stapylton at the depot. The reunited expedition now travelled south-east following the Murray. They passed Swan Hill on 21 June and encountered a group of native inhabitants at Lake Boga. These people were angry at Piper for &quot;bringing whitefellows&quot; to their country and threw spears at him. Piper shot one of them dead. Mitchell noted the local people&#x27;s practice of making large nets that spanned above the river to catch waterfowl and also came across unusual animals such as the now extinct Southern pig-footed bandicoot.
At the end of June, Mitchell chose to leave the Murray to investigate better looking lands to the south-west. Mitchell was so impressed with the country he saw, he named it Australia Felix. In early July the party crossed the Loddon River, and made their way in a south-westerly direction which brought them to the Grampians and the Wimmera River. Confrontation with people in this region resulted in an Indigenous man being shot in the arm. They were guided by a local Aboriginal woman along part of the Nangeela (Glenelg River) with Mitchell constructing a fortified base on its banks which he named Fort O&#x27;Hare. From here Mitchell led part of the group in boats down the Glenelg to where it discharged into the ocean at a bay which Mitchell named Discovery Bay. Mitchell then returned to Fort O&#x27;Hare and altered direction towards Portland Bay to the east. When this was reached on 29 August, Mitchell was surprised to find an established farm and whaling station operated by the Henty brothers.

The expedition continued north-east with Mitchell spending a night in a &quot;snug old hut of the natives&quot; at Narrawong. On 17 September, in order to speed his return, Mitchell split the party in two, taking 14 men with him and leaving the remainder with Stapylton to follow with the bullocks and drays. The young girl Ballandella went with Mitchell, while her mother Turandurey remained behind. On the plains around the Hopkins River, Mitchell came across a community of Aboriginal people who cultivated and harvested murnong tubers with specialised tools. Mitchell was wary and when forty of them approached his camp, he ordered his men to charge at them. On 30 September, Mitchell climbed and named Mount Macedon, from the summit of which he had a view of Port Phillip. Progress was slowed due a member of the group, James &quot;Tally-ho&quot; Taylor, drowning while crossing the Broken River. Their return to the frontier of British colonisation on the Murrumbidgee was not completed until 24 October.

====Enquiry====
When Mitchell arrived in Sydney in early November he was received with great joy. However, when the remainder of his party arrived two weeks later, rumours circulated about the mass killing on the Murray. He subsequently faced a Legislative Council Inquiry in December 1836, receiving an official rebuke. Ballandella joined Mitchell&#x27;s family of eight other children and learnt to read and write, but was left by Mitchell when he returned to England. Ballandella later married and raised a family at Sackville where she died around the age of thirty.

=== Fourth expedition ===
Mitchell&#x27;s fourth expedition was into northern interior of the colony (a region now part of Queensland) in 1845–46. He was convinced that a significant river must flow north-west into the Gulf of Carpentaria, and finding this river was the main focus of the endeavour.

On 15 December 1845 Mitchell started from Boree near Orange with a large party of 32 people including Edmund Kennedy as second in command (later speared to death at Escape River near Cape York). The Wiradjuri man named Piper from his previous expedition was also a member. Yuranigh (also Wiradjuri) and a ten year old boy from the lower Bogan River named &quot;Dicky&quot; were also assigned as guides. The party travelled north along the Bogan where a war between the British and the Indigenous inhabitants was at that time occurring. Mitchell noted areas where the British had been pushed back, abandoning their farmhouses which were subsequently burnt down by the local people. Mitchell stated &quot;All I could learn about the rest of the tribe was, that the men were almost all dead, and that their wives were chiefly servants at stock stations along the Macquarie.&quot;

In January 1846, they left the Bogan and started following the Macquarie River where Mitchell was informed of Pipers&#x27; intention to leave the expedition. Mitchell ordered him back to Bathurst, accompanied by Corporal Graham. Near the Macquarie Marshes the harvesting of native millet by Aboriginal people to make bread was recorded and a local man named Yulliyally guided the group to the Barwon River. From here two brothers from a nearby clan led Mitchell to vital waterholes near the Narran River. Mitchell &quot;blushed inwardly for our pallid race&quot; knowing that &quot;white man&#x27;s cattle would soon trample these holes into a quagmire of mud.&quot; More bundles of harvested millet lay for miles along their journey up the Narran. Mitchell then received a message from his son, Roderick Mitchell, a Crown Lands Commissioner who had previously been to the area, which recommended following the Balonne and the Culgoa rivers north. They encountered many Indigenous people who guided the group along the way. On 12 April 1846 Mitchell came to a natural bridge of rocks on the main branch of the Balonne which he called St. George Bridge, now the site of the town of St George. Kennedy was left in charge of the main body here, and was instructed to follow on slowly while Mitchell pushed ahead with a few men. Mitchell followed the Balonne to the Maranoa, and the Cogoon (now called Muckadilla Creek, near Roma). This rivulet led him to an area with an &quot;abundance of good pasturage&quot; in which stood a solitary double topped hill that he named Mount Abundance, on which grew a species of bottle tree. He then crossed to the Maranoa and awaited Kennedy&#x27;s arrival. Kennedy, who had trouble with local inhabitants trying to burn down his camp, rejoined Mitchell on 1 June 1846.

Leaving Kennedy for a second time, he set out on an extensive excursion of more than four months. Mitchell traversed the country at the head of the Maranoa, on one occasion discharging his rifle over the heads of the Indigenous people to gain &quot;peaceful occupation of the ground.&quot; He sighted the headwaters of the Warrego and Nogoa Rivers, then came across the upper reaches of the Belyando River which they followed for a considerable distance. This river&#x27;s name was given to Mitchell by Indigenous residents before the expedition&#x27;s dogs chased them away, biting at their legs. Being a tributary of the Burdekin River, a waterway already visited by Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition to Port Essington in 1845, Mitchell was dismayed to find that he was approaching ground already explored by Europeans. He returned to the head of the Nogoa and struck west, meeting with a tribe who caught emus with nets. He encountered a river which he was certain was the fabled waterway that would flow north-west to the Gulf of Carpentaria. He followed it until he came across a large clan of Aboriginal people living in permanent huts on the banks of a lagoon. He called this place Yuranigh Pond after his Wiradjuri guide and decided to return home. In honour of the British sovereign of the time, he named the waterway, Victoria River. On the homeward journey Mitchell noticed the well known grass that bears his name. They trekked back along the Maranoa River to St.George Bridge, arriving in Sydney 20 January 1847.

Later in 1847, Kennedy proved beyond doubt that the Victoria in fact did not continue north-west, but turned south-west and joined Cooper Creek. He renamed the watercourse the Barcoo River from a name mentioned by local Aboriginal people.

== Later career ==

In 1837, Mitchell sought 18 months leave from his position and in March he left Sydney for London. During his leave, he published an account of his explorations called &quot;Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia: with descriptions of the recently explored region of Australia Felix, and of the present colony of New South Wales&quot;. Mitchell sought additional periods of leave and finally arrived back in Australia in 1841. Mitchell left Sydney again in March 1847 on another period of leave. By the time he arrived back in mid-1848, he had published his &quot;Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia, in search of a route from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria&quot;.

Mitchell&#x27;s journals proved a rich source for historians and anthropologists, with their close and sympathetic observations of the Aboriginal peoples he had encountered. These publications made him the most celebrated Australian explorer of his day. But he was a difficult man to get on with, made evident by this passage made by Governor Charles Augustus FitzRoy:
&quot;It is notorious that Sir Thomas Mitchell&#x27;s unfortunate impracticability of temper and spirit of opposition of those in authority over him misled him into frequent collision with my predecessors.&quot;

In a by-election for the Electoral district of Port Phillip in April 1844, Mitchell was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council. He found it difficult to separate his roles of government employee and elected member of the legislature, and after only five months he resigned from the Legislative Council.

===Duel===
Mitchell is also remembered as the last person in Australia to challenge anyone to a duel. In September 1851, Mitchell issued a challenge to Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson (later Premier of New South Wales) because Donaldson had publicly criticised excessive spending by the Surveyor General&#x27;s Department. The duel took place in Sydney on 27 September, with both duellists missing their marks; only Donaldson&#x27;s hat was damaged. The French 50 calibre pistols used in the duel are in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.

==Ophir gold fields==
In 1851, Mitchell was instructed by Governor FitzRoy to make a report on, and survey of, &#x27;the extent and productiveness of the goldfield reported to have been discovered in the County of Bathurst.&#x27; He travelled west during winter to visit the Ophir gold diggings, accompanied by his son, Roderick, and Samuel Stutchbury the government geologist.

In June 1851 Mitchell selected the site for the township of Ophir. W.R. Davidson plotted a survey of the ground and Mitchell planned the streets and allotments for the town.

Mitchell returned with a collection of specimens from the diggings, mostly quartz, with 48 of these stored in a wooden chest. His report of the goldfields was presented to the Legislative Council in February 1852.

==Story of the &quot;bomerang&quot; propeller==
The search for a method of screw propulsion of ships intrigued many inventors during the latter half of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th. An Englishman, K. P. Smith, patented a screw propeller in 1836, and shortly afterwards Captain John Ericsson, formerly an officer of the Swedish army, patented another.

On his travels, Mitchell must have been evolving the idea of his boomerang propeller—he spelled it &quot;bomerang&quot;, while newspapers used &quot;bomarang&quot; and &quot;boomerang.&quot; The first test was made in the Sydney Harbour in May 1852, an iron propeller being fitted to the &quot;screw-steamer&quot; &quot;Keera&quot;. The results of this trial were considered satisfactory, the ship&#x27;s progress being calculated on two runs at 10 and a little over 12 knots, and Sir Thomas Mitchell took his Invention to England. In 1853 the propeller was fitted to the &quot;Genova&quot;, and a trial was conducted on the Mersey. Then the Admiralty gave it a test on . The &quot;Genova&quot; ran at 9.5 knots as against 8.5 with a screw propeller, and the &quot;Conflict&quot; 9.25 knots as against the screw propeller 8.75, and at a lower engine speed. The &quot;boomerang&quot; propeller can be simply described as a &quot;screw&quot; propeller with much of the blades close to the shaft, which contribute little to propulsion but much to drag, cut away, a principle which is well understood today.

==Family life==

Thomas and Mary Mitchell had twelve children: Livingstone, Roderick, Murray, Campbell, Thomas, Richard, Georgina, Maria, Emily, Camilla, Alicia, Blanche. Georgina and Maria died young, and Murray before 1847. Roderick became a Commissioner of Crown Lands and head of the Border Police in the Liverpool Plains district. Roderick was drowned during the last years of Mitchell&#x27;s life. Campbell discovered oil shale deposits and attempted to establish oil shale and coal mines; he died in 1883. 

Son Richard Blunt Mitchell (–10 June 1916) became a clerk of petty sessions in the Molong area in 1858, before returning in 1881 to Scotland after receiving a large inheritance on the death of his uncle and namesake Richard Blunt, settling in Peeblesshire. 

Camilla Victoria Mitchell married surveyor John Frederick Mann. Their son Gother Victor Fyers Mann was a prominent painter.

His family enjoyed a privileged upbringing, and Blanche Mitchell, his youngest daughter, recorded her daily activities and social life in childhood diaries and notebooks. Her sister Emily married George Edward Thicknesse-Touchet, 21st Baron Audley.

In 1841, Mitchell completed his new Gothic home, Carthona, on the water&#x27;s edge in Darling Point, Sydney. 

Following Mitchell&#x27;s death, his family moved to Craigend Terrace in Woolloomooloo.

== Death ==

In July 1855 a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the New South Wales Survey Department, but Mitchell did not live to see the report. While surveying the line of road between Nelligen and Braidwood, he developed a chill which led to a severe attack of bronchitis. He died a few days later at Carthona at Darling Point at 5:15 pm 5 October 1855. Newspapers of the day commented:&quot;For a period of twenty-eight years Sir Thomas Mitchell had served the Colony, much of that service having been exceedingly arduous and difficult. Among the early explorers of Australia his name will occupy an honoured place in the estimation of posterity.&quot;
He is buried at Camperdown Cemetery, Newtown, with his grave being maintained by the Seniors Group of Surveyors.

His wife Lady Mary Thomson Mitchell died on 21 December 1883. 

==Naming==
Some of the places Mitchell named on his expeditions were: the Avoca River, Balonne River, Belyando River, Campaspe River, Cogoon River, Discovery Bay, Glenelg River, Grampians, Maranoa River, Mount Arapiles, Mount King, Mount Macedon, Mount Napier, Mount William, Nyngan, Pyramid Hill, St George, Swan Hill and Wimmera River.

==Commemoration==

Because of his contributions in the surveying and exploration of Australia, Mitchell is commemorated by having numerous localities or objects across Australia being named after him. These include:
* The town of Mitchell in Queensland
* The Mitchell River in Queensland
* The Canberra suburb of Mitchell
* The electorate of Mitchell
* The Mitchell Highway
* The Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo, a species of cockatoo
* Mitchellstown in Victoria.
* A local government area in Victoria, Shire of Mitchell
* Steam locomotive number S 301 Sir Thomas Mitchell, a member of the Victorian Railways S class locomotives. In turn, Mitchell House at Seymour Technical High School, the town with the loco depot which serviced the famous four locos. Later, the name was carried by the diesel S301.
* Mitchell grass, common name of the small genus of grass species dominant across much of the arid areas of the continent
* Mitchell&#x27;s hopping mouse, an Australian native rodent-like animal
* Countless roadside locations in Victoria have a memorial erected &#x27;Major Mitchell passed here&#x27;.
* Sir Thomas Mitchell Road, Villawood
* Sir Thomas Mitchell Road, Bondi Beach 
* Sir Thomas Mitchell Drive, Bowenfels linking the Great Western Highway with the Cox River at a fitting memorial to colonial road builders. 

Mitchell is also the namesake in the highest honor of the New South Wales Surveyors Awards, the &quot;Sir Thomas Mitchell Excellence in Surveying Award&quot;.

Mitchell and his expeditions are commemorated by numerous memorials, in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland.

A map of the expedition of Major Sir Thomas Mitchell into the country between the Maranoa and Mount Mudge and the River Victoria, 1848 was ranked #38 in the ‘Top 150: Documenting Queensland’ exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives’ events and exhibition program which contributed to the state’s Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales.

<text>Phelsuma parkeri, commonly known as Parker&#x27;s day gecko or the Pemba Island day gecko, is a diurnal species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to Pemba Island, Tanzania, and typically inhabits banana trees and dwellings. The Pemba Island day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
Both the specific name, &quot;parkeri&quot;, and one of the common names, Parker&#x27;s day gecko, are in honor of English herpetologist Hampton Wildman Parker.

==Description==
Parker&#x27;s day gecko is a slender lizard and a mid-size day gecko. It can reach a total length (including tail) of about . The body colour is bright green. A faint red stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. On the back and limbs tiny black spots and speckles are present. This species has yellow eye rings. The ventral side is white.

==Distribution==
The Pemba Island day gecko is found only on 1,340-square-kilometre (517-square-mile) Pemba Island, which has a few much smaller islands around its coast, and which is from the Tanzanian mainland.

==Habitat==
&quot;Phelsuma parkeri&quot; is often found on different large trees such as banana trees and palms. This species also lives near or on human dwellings.

==Diet==
Parker&#x27;s day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also licks soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
The Pemba Island day gecko is quite shy and stays so, even in captivity.

==Reproduction==
The females of &quot;P. parkeri&quot; are colony nesters and many eggs can be found at one location. The neonates measure about .

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
Parker&#x27;s day geckos should be housed in pairs. They need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about during the day. The humidity should be maintained around 65–75% during the day and slightly higher at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

<text>The president of South Africa is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of South Africa. The president directs the executive branch of the government and is the commander-in-chief of the South African National Defence Force. Between 1961 and 1994, the office of head of state was the state presidency.

The president is elected by the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, and is usually the leader of the largest party, which has been the African National Congress since the first multiracial election was held on 27 April 1994. The Constitution limits the president&#x27;s time in office to two five-year terms. The first president to be elected under the new constitution was Nelson Mandela. The incumbent is Cyril Ramaphosa, who was elected by the National Assembly on 15 February 2018 following the resignation of Jacob Zuma.

Under the interim constitution (valid from 1994–96), there was a Government of National Unity, in which a member of Parliament (MP) from the largest opposition party was entitled to a position as deputy president. Along with Thabo Mbeki, the last apartheid president, F. W. de Klerk also served as deputy president, in his capacity as the leader of the National Party which was the second-largest party in the new Parliament. But De Klerk later resigned and went into opposition with his party. A voluntary coalition government continues to exist under the new constitution (adopted in 1996), although there have been no appointments of opposition politicians to the post of deputy president since.

The president is required to be a member of the National Assembly at the time of the election. Upon election, the president immediately resigns their seat for the duration of the presidential term. The president may be removed either by a motion of no-confidence or an impeachment trial.

==Origins==
A number of manifestations of the office of president have existed. Aspects of these offices exist within the presidency today. The executive leadership of the British colonies of Natal and the Cape of Good Hope were vested in their governors. Likewise, it was invested in the presidents of the Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. Alternating sovereignty as a result of wars culminated in the Treaty of Vereeniging which concluded the South African War.

The Union of South Africa, a British Dominion, was established on 31 May 1910 with the British monarch as titular head of state, represented by a viceroy, the governor-general.

Following the 1960 referendum and subsequent declaration of the Republic of South Africa on 31 May 1961, the office of State President was created. It was originally a ceremonial post, but became an executive post in 1984 when a new constitution abolished the post of Prime Minister and transferred its powers to the state president. The country ended minority rule in 1994. The office of the president, and the roles that come with it, were established by chapter five of the Constitution of South Africa.

==Electoral system==
South Africa has a distinctive system for the election of its president. Unlike other former British colonies and dominions who have adopted a parliamentary republican form of government and those that follow the Westminster system, South Africa&#x27;s president is both head of state and head of government and commander-in-chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). Contrary to presidential systems around the world, the president of South Africa is elected by the Parliament of South Africa rather than by the people directly. They are thus answerable to it in theory and able to influence legislation in practice as head of the majority party.

The president is elected at the first sitting of Parliament after an election, and whenever a vacancy arises. The president is elected by the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, from among its members. The chief justice must oversee the election. Once elected, a person is no longer a member of the National Assembly. They must then be sworn in as president within five days of the election. Should a vacancy arise, the date of a new election must be set by the chief justice, but not more than 30 days after the vacancy occurs.

The Constitution has thus prescribed a system combining both parliamentary and presidential systems in a unique manner. Only Botswana and a few other countries use a similar system. Between 1996 and 2003 Israel combined the two systems in an opposite way, with direct elections for the post of prime minister.

Although the presidency is the key institution, it is hedged about with numerous checks and balances that prevent its total dominance over the government, as was the case in many African countries. The presidential term is five years, with a limit of two terms. Thus the electoral system attempts (at least on paper) to prevent the accumulation of power in the president as occurred during Apartheid and as is the case currently in many other African countries.

==Succession==
According to chapter five of the constitution, the president can only exercise the powers of the presidential office while within the Republic of South Africa. The president may appoint an acting president when travelling outside the country or unable to fulfill the duties of the office.

A presidential vacancy should be filled first by the deputy president, then a Cabinet minister selected by the president, thereafter a Cabinet minister selected by the Cabinet, and finally by the speaker of the National Assembly.

==Presidential powers==

The president is the head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the South African National Defence Force. The rights, responsibilities and remuneration of the president are enumerated in Chapter V of the Constitution of South Africa and subsequent amendments and laws passed by the Parliament of South Africa.

The executive powers of the republic are vested in the president, who appoints various officials to positions listed in the Constitution, the most significant of which are the Cabinet ministers and justices of the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court. The president&#x27;s Cabinet implements and enforces the Constitution and laws and carries out the president&#x27;s political objectives. Judges are appointed on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission.

The president plays a role in the formation of legislation. The president can sign bills into laws or veto legislation (subject to an override), refer bills back to Parliament or to the Constitutional Court, or call for a referendum. The president summons parliament, and often delivers a State of the Nation Address at the beginning of each session.

The president is the commander-in-chief of the South African National Defence Force thereby possessing influence or control over foreign and security policy. The president is accorded the constitutional powers to declare war and make peace, negotiate and sign (although not ratify) treaties (and the alliances that may come with them), and receives and appoints diplomatic officials, confers honours and grants pardons.

<text>The Workers&#x27; Party () is an Irish republican, Marxist–Leninist communist party active in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The party formerly asserted a claim of direct descent from the original Sinn Féin organisation founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith. It took its current form in 1970 following a division within Sinn Féin, in which the majority faction followed the leadership in a Marxist direction. It was known as Sinn Féin (Gardiner Place) or Official Sinn Féin, to distinguish it from the minority faction of &quot;Sinn Féin (Kevin Street)&quot; or &quot;Provisional Sinn Féin&quot;. It changed its name from Sinn Féin to Sinn Féin The Workers&#x27; Party in 1977 and then to the Workers&#x27; Party in 1982. In that time, Provisional Sinn Féin came to be known simply as Sinn Féin. Both groups were tied to corresponding paramilitary groups, with Official Sinn Féin tied to the Official Irish Republican Army.

By the late 1980s, the party had broken through electorally in the Republic of Ireland and at its peak it elected 7 TDs at the 1989 general election and 21 councillors at the 1991 local elections. However, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, almost all the party&#x27;s elected members broke away and formed Democratic Left in 1992. Since 1992 the party has existed as a microparty. A 2021 split in the party left the party&#x27;s status disputed.

==Name==
In 1971, it registered to contest Dáil and local elections in the Republic of Ireland under the name Sinn Féin. From the early to mid-1970s, it was known as Official Sinn Féin or &quot;Sinn Féin (Gardiner Place)&quot; to distinguish it from the rival offshoot Provisional Sinn Féin, or &quot;Sinn Féin (Kevin Street)&quot;. Gardiner Place had symbolic power as the headquarters of Sinn Féin for decades before the 1970 split.

At its Ardfheis in January 1977, Official Sinn Féin renamed itself &quot;Sinn Féin – The Workers&#x27; Party&quot;. Its first seats in Dáil Éireann were won under this new name. A motion at the 1979 Ardfheis to remove the &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; prefix from the party name was narrowly defeated. This change would come about three years later.

In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin was organised under the name Republican Clubs to avoid a ban on Sinn Féin candidates (introduced in 1964 under Northern Ireland&#x27;s Emergency Powers Act). The Officials continued to use this name after 1970, and later used the name Workers&#x27; Party Republican Clubs. In 1982, both the northern and southern sections of the party became The Workers&#x27; Party.

The Workers&#x27; Party is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Sticks&quot; or &quot;Stickies&quot; because in the 1970s it used adhesive stickers for the Easter Lily emblem in its 1916 commemorations, whereas Provisional Sinn Féin used a pin for theirs.

==History==

===Origins===
The modern origins of the party date from the early 1960s. After the failure of the then IRA&#x27;s 1956–1962 border campaign, the republican movement, with a new military and political leadership, undertook a complete reappraisal of its . Through the 1960s, some leading figures in the movement, such as Cathal Goulding, Seán Garland, Billy McMillen, Tomás Mac Giolla, moved steadily to the left, even to Marxism, as a result of their own reading and thinking and contacts with the Irish and international left. This angered more traditional republicans, who wanted to stick to the national question and armed struggle. Also involved in this debate was the Connolly Association. This group&#x27;s analysis saw the primary obstacle to Irish unity as the continuing division between the Protestant and Catholic working classes. This it attributed to the &quot;divide and rule&quot; policies of capitalism, whose interests were served by the working classes remaining divided. Military activity was seen as counterproductive, because its effect was to further entrench sectarian divisions. The left-wing faction believed the working classes could be united in class struggle to overthrow their common rulers, with a 32-county socialist republic being the inevitable outcome.

However, this Marxist outlook became unpopular with many of the more traditionalist republicans, and the party/army leadership was criticised for failing to defend northern Catholic enclaves from loyalist attacks (these debates took place against the background of the violent beginning of what would be termed the Troubles). A growing minority within the rank-and-file wanted to maintain traditional militarist policies aimed at ending British rule in Northern Ireland. An equally contentious issue involved whether to or not to continue with the policy of abstentionism, that is, the refusal of elected representatives to take their seats in British or Irish legislatures. A majority of the leadership favoured abandoning this policy.

A group consisting of Seán Mac Stiofáin, Dáithí Ó Conaill, Seamus Twomey, and others, established themselves as a &quot;Provisional Army Council&quot; in 1969 in anticipation of a contentious 1970 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis (delegate conference). At the Ard Fheis, the leadership of Sinn Féin failed to attain the required two-thirds majority to change the party&#x27;s position on abstentionism. The debate was charged with allegations of vote-rigging and expulsions. When the Ard Fheis went on to pass a vote of confidence in the &quot;official&quot; Army Council (which had already approved an end to the abstentionist policy), Ruairí Ó Brádaigh led the minority in a walk-out, and went to a prearranged meeting in Parnell Square where they announced the establishment of a &quot;caretaker&quot; executive of Sinn Féin. The dissident council became known as the &quot;Provisional Army Council&quot; and its party and military wing as Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA, while those remaining became known as Official Sinn Féin and the Official IRA. Official Sinn Féin, under the leadership of Tomás Mac Giolla, remained aligned to Goulding&#x27;s Official IRA.

A key factor in the split was the desire of those who became the Provisionals to make military action the key object of the organisation, rather than a simple rejection of leftism. The pre-split leadership, they stated, had attempted to replace the programme of Wolfe Tone and James Connolly with &quot;the foreign socialism of Marx and Mao&quot;. If this had gone unchecked, their argument went, the &quot;traditional&quot; IRA would have been replaced by the “so-called National Liberation Movement”, including Communist Party members.

In 1977, Official Sinn Féin ratified the party&#x27;s new name—&quot;Sinn Féin The Workers&#x27; Party&quot;—without dissension. According to Richard Sinnott, this &quot;symbolism&quot; was completed in April 1982 when the party became simply the Workers&#x27; Party.

===Political development===
====OIRA ceasefire====

Although the Official IRA became drawn into the spiralling violence of the early period of conflict in Northern Ireland, it almost immediately reduced its military campaign against the United Kingdom&#x27;s armed presence in Northern Ireland, declaring a permanent ceasefire in May 1972. Following this, the movement&#x27;s political development increased rapidly throughout the 1970s.

On the national question, the Officials saw the struggle against religious sectarianism and bigotry as their primary task. The party&#x27;s strategy stemmed from the &quot;stages theory&quot;: firstly, working-class unity within Northern Ireland had to be achieved, followed by the establishment of a united Ireland, and finally a socialist society would be created in Ireland.

==== IRSP/INLA split and feud ====
In 1974, the Official Republican Movement split over the ceasefire and the direction of the organisation. This led to the formation of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) with Seamus Costello (whom the Official IRA had expelled) as its chairperson. Also formed on the same day was IRSP&#x27;s paramilitary wing, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). A number of tit-for-tat killings occurred in a subsequent feud until a truce was agreed in 1977.

In 1977, the party published and accepted as policy a document called the &quot;Irish Industrial Revolution&quot;. Written by Eoghan Harris and Eamon Smullen, it outlined the party&#x27;s economic stance and declared that the ongoing violence in Northern Ireland was &quot;distracting working class attention from the class struggle to a mythical national question&quot;. The policy document used Marxist terminology: it identified US imperialism as the now-dominant political and economic force in the southern state and attacked the failure of the national bourgeoisie to develop Ireland as a modern economic power.

Official Sinn Féin gravitated towards Marxism-Leninism and became fiercely critical of the physical force Irish republicanism still espoused by Provisional Sinn Féin. Its new approach to the Northern conflict was typified by the slogan it would adopt: &quot;Peace, Democracy, Class Politics&quot;. It aimed to replace sectarian politics with a class struggle which would unite Catholic and Protestant workers. The slogan&#x27;s echo of Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;Peace, Bread, Land&quot; was indicative of the party&#x27;s new source of inspiration. Official Sinn Féin also built up fraternal relations with the USSR and with socialist, workers&#x27; and communist parties around the world.

Throughout the 1980s, the party came to staunchly oppose republican political violence, controversially to the point of recommending cooperating with British security forces. They were one of the few organisations on the left of Irish politics to oppose the INLA/Provisional IRA 1981 Irish hunger strike.

The Workers&#x27; Party (especially the faction around Harris) strongly criticised traditional Irish republicanism, causing some of its critics such as Vincent Browne and Paddy Prendeville to accuse it of having an attitude to Northern Ireland that was close to Ulster unionism.

===Ned Stapleton Cumann inside RTÉ===
Part of the party&#x27;s plan to gain influence in the Republic of Ireland was the formation and maintenance of a secret branch (&quot;cumann&quot;), the Ned Stapleton Cumann, inside Ireland&#x27;s national broadcaster RTÉ. Centred around the leadership of Eoghan Harris, the members were all employees of RTÉ and many of them were journalists. Members included Charlie Bird, John Caden and Marian Finucane. The branch started in the early 1970s and continued to operate in secrecy until the Worker&#x27;s Party broke apart in the early 1990s as the Soviet Union collapsed (1991) and likewise the Workers&#x27; Party saw a major split with the formation of the Democratic Left (1992). Remaining undetected was fundamental to the existence of the Cumann, as officially RTÉ reporters were not allowed to have party-political affiliations, in order to appear objective as journalists. The Cumann was influential within RTÉ, and used its position to shape the output of RTÉ programming; they pushed for narratives which reflected the official Sinn Féin/Workers&#x27; Party outlook, particularly in relation to the Provisional IRA.

One programme impacted by the Cumann, &quot;Today Tonight&quot;, aired 4 nights a week and focused on investigative journalism. Although not directly involved with the show, the Cumann members ensured that SFWP members regularly appeared on the programme without having to acknowledge their membership. The Cumann was also able to influence one of RTÉ&#x27;s flagship shows &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, and placed SFWP activists into the show&#x27;s studio audience, a studio audience who often took part in discussions on the show.

During 1981 Irish hunger strike, the Cumann was deeply annoyed by the positive coverage that the hunger strikers (such as Bobby Sands) began to receive, as they were aligned with the Provisionals. In response, they produced pieces which focused on the victims of violence by the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland.

===1992 split between Workers&#x27; Party and Democratic Left===

In early 1992, following a failed attempt to change the organisation&#x27;s constitution, six of the party&#x27;s seven TDs, its MEP, numerous councillors and a significant minority of its membership broke off to form Democratic Left, a party which later merged with the Labour Party in 1999.

The reasons for the split were twofold. Firstly, a faction led by Proinsias De Rossa wanted to move the party towards an acceptance of free-market economics. Following the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, they felt that the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s Marxist stance was now an obstacle to winning support at the polls. Secondly, media accusations had once again surfaced regarding the continued existence of the Official IRA which, it was alleged, remained armed and involved in fund-raising robberies, money laundering and other forms of criminality.

De Rossa and his supporters sought to distance themselves from alleged paramilitary activity at a special Árd Fheis held at Dún Laoghaire on 15 February 1992. A motion proposed by De Rossa and General Secretary Des Geraghty sought to stand down the existing membership, elect an 11-member provisional executive council and make several other significant changes in party structures was defeated. The motion to &quot;reconstitute&quot; the party achieved the support of 61% of delegates. However, this was short of the two-thirds majority needed to change the Workers&#x27; Party constitution. The Workers&#x27; Party later claimed that there was vote rigging by the supporters of the De Rossa motion. As a result of the conference&#x27;s failure to adopt the motion, De Rossa and his supporters split from the organisation and established a new party which was temporarily known as &quot;New Agenda&quot; before the permanent name of &quot;Democratic Left&quot; was adopted. In the South the rump of the party was left with seven councillors and one TD.

In the North, before the 1992 split, the party had four councillors – Tom French stayed with the party, Gerry Cullen (Dungannon) and Seamus Lynch (Belfast) joined New Agenda/Democratic Left, and David Kettyles ran in subsequent elections in Fermanagh as an Independent or Progressive Socialist.

While the majority of public representatives left with De Rossa, many members remained in the Workers&#x27; Party. Sean Garland condemned those who broke away as &quot;careerists&quot; and social democrats who had taken flight after the collapse of the Soviet Union and labelled them &quot;liquidators&quot;. Marian Donnelly replaced De Rossa as president from 1992 to 1994. Tom French became president in 1994, and served for four years until Sean Garland was elected president in 1998. Garland retired as president in May 2008, and was replaced by Mick Finnegan who served until September 2014, being replaced by Michael Donnelly

A further minor split occurred when a number of members left and established a group called Republican Left; many of these went on to join the Irish Socialist Network. Another split occurred in 1998, after a number of former OIRA members in Newry and Belfast, who had been expelled, formed a group called the Official Republican Movement, which announced in 2010 that it had decommissioned its weapons.

===21st century===
The Workers&#x27; Party has struggled since the early 1990s to rejuvenate its fortunes in both Irish jurisdictions. The Workers&#x27; Party maintains a youth wing, Workers&#x27; Party Youth, and a Women&#x27;s Committee. It also had offices in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and Waterford. Apart from its political work at home in Ireland, it has sent party delegations to international gatherings of communist and socialist parties.

The party supported an independent anti-sectarian candidate, John Gilliland, in the 2004 European elections in Northern Ireland.

Waterford City remained a holdout for the party in the 1990s and early 2000s. In the 1997 general election, Martin O&#x27;Regan narrowly failed to secure a seat in Waterford. However, in February 2008, John Halligan of Waterford resigned from the party when it refused to drop its opposition to service charges. He was later elected a TD for Waterford in the 2011 general election. The party&#x27;s sole remaining councillor in Waterford lost his seat in the 2014 local elections.

Michael Donnelly, a Galway-based university lecturer, was elected as the party President at the party&#x27;s Ard Fheis on 27 September 2014 on the retirement of Mick Finnegan.

The Workers&#x27; Party called for a No vote against the Treaty of Lisbon in both the June 2008 referendum, in which the proposal was rejected, and the October 2009 referendum, in which the proposal was approved. It was the only left-wing party to campaign for a No vote in the 2013 Seanad abolition referendum. It called for a Yes vote in the marriage equality referendum in 2015. The party supported Brexit in the 2016 referendum.
The party has been involved in campaigning for public housing and renters&#x27; rights as a response to the ongoing housing crisis in Ireland. In 2016, the party published Solidarity Housing, a public housing policy that proposed a cost-rental housing model for Ireland. Later that year, a Workers&#x27; Party motion for 100% mixed-income public housing on the publicly owned O&#x27;Devaney Gardens site in the north inner city was passed by Dublin City Councillors, but was later overturned after an intervention by Minister for Housing Simon Coveney.

The party retains a tradition of secularism. In April 2017, Councillor Éilis Ryan organised a demonstration against the proposed control of the new National Maternity Hospital by the Religious Sisters of Charity. The Workers&#x27; Party campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum to repeal the Eighth amendment in May 2018, having been the only party in the Dáil to oppose the introduction of the Eighth amendment in 1983.

At the 2019 local elections, Éilís Ryan lost her seat on Dublin City Council, leaving Ted Tynan as the party&#x27;s only elected representative in Ireland.

In November 2020, the Standards in Public Office Commission announced that the Workers&#x27; Party were one of five political parties who failed to provide them with a set of audited accounts for 2019, in breach of statutory obligations.

====2021 split====
In April 2021, &quot;The Phoenix&quot; reported that at the party&#x27;s annual Ardfheis the party voted to expel their only elected representative Ted Tynan. This is disputed by the party themselves. In response, a faction of the party called an emergency general meeting in which they backed a vote of no confidence in party president Michael Donnelly and voted Tynan as his successor. Micheal McCorry, who had been General Secretary, became president of the Donnelly faction, with Tynan president of the breakaway faction. The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; also reported upon the story in April 2021, and suggested one faction had tried to expel Tynan on the stated basis that he had not paid his membership fee for that year. However, Tynan told the Belfast Telegraph that he believed the actual basis for his expulsion was that a new guard of members who wished to move the party towards more Irish Republican positions, such as being in favour of a referendum on Irish reunification, sought to push him out of the organisation. Historically the Workers&#x27; Party opposed a border poll on the basis it would be &quot;sectarian&quot; and pit Nationalists against Unionists, and argued instead that the solution to Northern Ireland would be to unite both groups under the banner of Internationalist Socialism. Tynan and his supporters seek to retain the old position. The rights to use the &#x27;Workers Party&#x27; name are disputed; the Tynan-led party can be identified by the use of the logo showing two clasped hands, while the McCorry-led party uses the logo of the &#x27;starry plough&#x27; and has revived the &#x27;Republican Clubs&#x27; name within Northern Ireland.

====Nuclear Power====

In 2023, the Workers&#x27; Party launched its policy document &quot;Lets Get Real&quot;, stating that nuclear power is the only energy option for Ireland which is reliable, affordable and low carbon.

The party advocates Ireland building 6 conventional nuclear plants at 2 or 3 sites for an estimated cost of €50 billion.
==Electoral performance==

===Republic of Ireland===
The Workers&#x27; Party made its electoral breakthrough in 1981 when Joe Sherlock won a seat in Cork East. It increased this to three seats in 1982 and to four seats in 1987. The Workers&#x27; Party had its best performance at the polls in 1989 when it won seven seats in the general election and party president Proinsias De Rossa won a seat in Dublin in the European election held on the same day, sitting with the communist Left Unity group.
Following the split of 1992, Tomás Mac Giolla, a TD in the Dublin West constituency and president of the party for most of the previous 30 years, was the only member of the Dáil parliamentary party not to side with the new Democratic Left. Mac Giolla lost his seat in the general election later that year, and no TD has been elected for the party since then. However, at local authority level, the Workers&#x27; Party maintained elected representation on Dublin, Cork and Waterford corporations in the aftermath of the split, and Mac Giolla was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1993.

Outside of the south-east, the Workers&#x27; Party retains active branches in various areas of the Republic, including Dublin, Cork and County Meath. In the 1999 local elections, it lost all of its seats in Dublin and Cork and only managed to retain three seats in Waterford City. Further electoral setbacks and a minor split left the party after the 2004 local elections, with only two councillors, both in Waterford.

The party fielded twelve candidates in the 2009 local elections. The party ran Malachy Steenson in the Dublin Central by-election on the same date. Ted Tynan was elected to Cork City Council in the Cork City North East ward. Davy Walsh retained his seat in Waterford City Council. In the 2014 local elections Tynan retained his seat; however Walsh lost his, following major boundary changes resulting from the merging of Waterford City and County councils. In January 2015, Independent councillor Éilis Ryan on Dublin City Council joined the party.

In the 2011 general election the Workers&#x27; Party ran six candidates, without success. In the 2016 general election, the party ran five candidates, again without success.

At the 2019 Irish local elections, the party dropped to one remaining councillor, with Éilís Ryan losing her seat on Dublin City Council.

====Dáil Éireann elections====
====Irish local elections====
===Northern Ireland===
The party gained ten seats at the 1973 Northern Ireland local elections. At the 1977 Northern Ireland local elections, this fell to six council seats and 2.6% of the vote. One of their best results was when Tom French polled 19% in the 1986 Upper Bann by-election, although no other candidates stood against the sitting MP and a year later, when other parties contested the constituency, he only polled 4.7% of the vote.

Three councillors left the party during the split in 1992. Davy Kettyles became an independent &#x27;Progressive Socialist&#x27; while Gerry Cullen in Dungannon and the Workers&#x27; Party northern chairman, Seamus Lynch in Belfast, joined Democratic Left. The party held on to its one council seat in the 1993 local elections with Peter Smyth retaining the seat that had been held by Tom French in Loughside, Craigavon. This was lost in 1997, leaving them without elected representation in Northern Ireland.

The party performed poorly in the 2007 Assembly election; it won no seats, and in its best result in Belfast West, it gained 1.26% of the vote. The party did not field any candidates at the 2010 Westminster general election. In the 2011 Assembly election the Workers&#x27; Party ran in four constituencies, securing 586 first-preference votes (1.7%) in Belfast West and 332 (1%) in Belfast North.

The party contested the 2015 Westminster general election, standing parliamentary candidates in Northern Ireland for the first time in ten years. It fielded five candidates and secured 2,724 votes, with Gemma Weir picking up 919 votes (2.3%) in Belfast North. The party did not field candidates in the 2019 Westminster general election. In June 2020 the Ard Comhairle announced the Northern Ireland Business Committee and Belfast Constituency Council had split from the party by adopting &quot;pro-unionist&quot; policies.

The party contested the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election, winning 839 (0.10%) first-round votes.

==Publications==
The party has published a number of newspapers throughout the years, with many of the theorists of the movement writing for these papers. After the 1970 split the Officials kept publishing the &quot;United Irishman&quot; (the traditional newspaper of the republican movement) monthly until May 1980. In 1973 the party launched a weekly paper &quot;The Irish People&quot;, which was focused on issues in the Republic of Ireland, there was also a &quot;The Northern People&quot; published in Belfast and focused on northern issues. The party published an occasional international bulletin and a woman&#x27;s magazine called &quot;Women&#x27;s View&quot;. From 1989 to 1992 it produced a theoretical magazine called &quot;Making Sense&quot;. Other papers were produced such as &quot;Workers&#x27; Weekly&quot;.

The party produces a magazine, &quot;Look Left&quot;. Originally conceived as a straightforward party paper, &quot;Look Left&quot; was relaunched as a more broad-left style publication in March 2010 but still bearing the emblem of the Workers&#x27; Party. It is distributed by party members and supporters and is also stocked by a number of retailers including Eason&#x27;s and several radical/left-wing bookshops.

<text>Phelsuma pusilla pusilla is a diurnal gecko and lives in eastern Madagascar. It typically inhabits different trees and houses. This day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Scientific synonyms==
*&quot;Phelsuma lineata pusilla&quot; 
*&quot;Phelsuma pusilla&quot; 
*&quot;Phelsuma pusilla pusilla&quot; 

== Description==
The lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos and can reach a total length of about 8 cm. The body colour is lime green, with red dots on the back and brown or black flanks. The tail has a blue hue and can be turquoise. The ventral side is white.

== Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Phelsuma pusilla pusilla&quot; lives in the moist and warm climate of the east coast of Madagascar, where it was first found in the region around Abila Lemaitso near Brickaville, but also occurs on the island Nosy Bohara. It inhabits different small trees and also occurs on banana trees, often close to human dwellings.

== Diet==
Various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Behaviour==
These geckos are quite quarrelsome and do not accept other males. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a females. In this case the male and female must be separated.

== Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about 28 °C (locally around 30 °C) during the day and drop to around 20 °C at night. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 80% during the day. It is also important to include two colder months with a daytime temperature of 24 °C and 16 °C at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>The Nottingham Goose Fair is an annual travelling funfair held at the Forest Recreation Ground in Nottingham, England, during the first week of October. Largely provided by travelling Showmen, it is one of three established fairs in the United Kingdom to carry the name, the others being the smaller Goosey Fair in Tavistock, Devon, and the even smaller Michaelmas Goose Fayre in Colyford, East Devon. In recent years, there have been more than 400,000 visitors to Nottingham&#x27;s fair annually.

Now known for its fairground rides and attractions, Goose Fair started as a livestock and trade event, with a reputation for its excellent cheese. The name &quot;Goose Fair&quot; is derived from the thousands of geese that were driven from the Lincolnshire fens in the East of England to be sold in Nottingham at the fair each year.

In 1284, a royal charter was granted by King Edward I that referred to city fairs in Nottingham, although it is thought that a fair was already established in the city before then. Goose Fair was originally held for eight days starting on 21 September, but was moved to early October in 1752, when the Gregorian calendar was first adopted in Britain. For centuries, the fair was held in Nottingham&#x27;s Old Market Square in the city centre, until it was moved to the Forest Recreation Ground in 1928, due to space limitations and planned redevelopment of the market square.

Goose Fair was cancelled in 1646 after an outbreak of the bubonic plague, and again during the two World Wars of the 20th century. The fair was not held in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was cancelled in 2021 for the second year running, after plans for an entrance fee and perimeter fencing were rejected by the organisers. For 2022, as of March, negotiations were underway to extend the fair&#x27;s normal five-day duration to ten days.
==History==
===Early history===
It is not known exactly how long a fair has existed in Nottingham, but it has certainly been around for many centuries and may date back more than a thousand years. The earliest reference to a &quot;St Mathew&#x27;s Fair&quot; in Nottingham, held on 21 September, comes from Saxon times. It is also known that the Danes had a settlement in Nottingham, and they most likely established a market, which may have included a primitive fair.

The creation of commercial fairs by royal charter was widespread in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In 1164, a charter was granted by King Henry II to Lenton Priory, near Nottingham, to hold an annual Martinmas Fair starting on 11 November. The royal charter meant that this fair took priority over any other fairs in the Nottingham district, which were forbidden for the duration of the Lenton fair. Then in 1284, King Edward I granted a charter for a separate fair to be held in Nottingham on St. Matthew&#x27;s Day, although it is clear that a fair had already been established in Nottingham by the time the charter was granted. Nottingham&#x27;s fair flourished in Tudor times, because the 1284 charter released it from the restrictions and competition of the nearby Lenton fair.

The first reference to the name &quot;Goose Fair&quot; can be found in the Nottingham Borough Records of 1541, where 21 September is referred to as &quot;Goose Fair Day&quot;. The name comes from the hundreds of geese that were driven on foot from Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to be sold in Nottingham. The birds&#x27; feet were coated with a mixture of tar and sand to protect them on the long journey of fifty miles or more. It is recorded that up to 20,000 geese were driven up through Hockley and along &quot;Goose Gate&quot; into Nottingham&#x27;s Old Market Square, where the fair was held annually for hundreds of years. The geese were sold in Nottingham to provide the traditional Michaelmas dish of roast goose; geese that had hatched in the spring were ready for the table by the end of September. Michaelmas was celebrated on 29 September to mark the end of the harvest season.

In 1752, the fair was moved back from St Matthew&#x27;s Day (21 September) to the first week in October because of a revision to the British calendar. On that year, eleven days (3–13 September) were omitted altogether from the calendar so that Britain could finally adopt the Gregorian calendar (following the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750) to align with the rest of western Europe. Hence, the start of Goose Fair was shifted to 2 October and has remained on or around that date ever since.

Goose Fair began as a trade event and, besides the sale of geese and other livestock, it became particularly famous for its high-quality cheese. In 1766, there was a cheese riot that was triggered by a sharp increase in the price of cheese compared with the previous year. The riot culminated in the mayor being toppled by a large cheese.

From an early date, side shows were added to entertain the crowds, and eventually the trade element diminished as transport links improved and annual fairs were no longer essential for stocking up on items from travelling merchants. Fairground rides started to take over, and by the end of the 19th century Goose Fair included various gondola rides and gallopers, switchback horses, a tunnel railway, bikes, yachts, and animal side shows. The fair gradually spread out into the streets surrounding the Old Market Square, which led to increased congestion, especially with the growth of traffic in the city. In 1928, the fair was relocated to the Forest Recreation Ground, having finally outgrown the city centre. The move was highly controversial at the time, but the concerns proved to be unfounded as the new site, which is more than twice the size of the market square, turned out to be an ideal alternative.

Nottingham&#x27;s Goose Fair has not run continuously throughout its history. It was cancelled in 1646 because of the Great Plague, and again during World War I (1914–1918). Although officially cancelled for the duration of World War II (1939–1944), the fair was held for a week in July 1943 during daylight hours (due to the wartime blackout regulations), and another daylight-only Goose Fair was allowed in August 1944. The fair resumed on its traditional date of the first Thursday in October in 1945.

The length of the fair has varied over the years; originally eight days long, the fair was shortened to three days in the late 19th century, but was increased again to four days after the turn of the 20th century.

===Recent history===

Goose Fair is held annually at the Forest Recreation Ground, which is about a mile north of Nottingham city centre. It takes over all of the grassy area of the recreation ground as well as half of the car park. A large area adjacent to the fairground is used as a temporary encampment for the show travellers to inhabit for the duration of the fair.

Special road systems take effect during the Goose Fair to allow the additional traffic to flow more easily. To prevent traffic congestion, parking is restricted in the local area, and no loading is allowed on local streets. The use of public transport is encouraged; there are regular trams to the Forest Recreation Ground and buses to the nearby Mansfield Road and Sherwood Rise.

The official countdown to Goose Fair is marked by the appearance of &quot;Goosey&quot;, the fair&#x27;s giant goose mascot. In the run-up to the fair, the 2-metre-high fibreglass and timber statue is installed on a roundabout on Mansfield Road, adjacent to the Forest Recreation Ground. This annual tradition started in the 1960s. The fair is officially opened each year with a ceremonial ringing of a pair of silver bells by the Lord Mayor of Nottingham.

The Cinema Museum holds film of the Fair from 1948.HM0366.

Goose Fair has opened for four days over most of its recent history, but it was permanently extended from four to five days in 2009. The date of Nottingham&#x27;s fair has created a problem in recent years, as it overlaps with the Hull Fair. Some of the top rides from the Goose Fair have therefore to travel directly from Nottingham to Hull, not opening at Hull until around the fourth day of the fair.

The fair has seldom been affected by violence. However, in 2004, 14-year-old Danielle Beccan was murdered near her home in St. Ann&#x27;s, when a gang from a rival district opened fire from their car on a group of children walking home from the fair.

Goose Fair was not held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was officially cancelled on 21 August 2020 amidst ongoing safety concerns. It was cancelled again in 2021 because of &quot;ongoing concerns and uncertainty&quot; over COVID-19 and the fact that less than half of Nottingham&#x27;s residents had been fully vaccinated. Earlier plans for an entrance fee and perimeter fencing to allow the fair to go ahead were scrapped after a backlash from organisers. 2022&#x27;s event subsequently ran for twice the usual length, at 10 days.

==21st-century attractions==
Almost half a million visitors flock to Nottingham&#x27;s Goose Fair annually. These days it is mostly famous for its fairground rides and games, boasting over five hundred attractions, some for thrill seekers and many that appeal to the whole family.

Rides for the more adventurous fair-goers include Speed XXL, a 3&quot;g&quot; spinning pendulum ride; XLR8, a 4&quot;g&quot; spinning drum ride; the Wild Mouse, a high-speed roller coaster with spinning carts; and the Reverse Bungee, an elasticated vertical catapult. Magic, a suspended modern-day version of the Waltzer, first appeared at Goose Fair in 2017, and a huge swinging/rotating disc ride called the Giant Frisbee was introduced the same year.

The many family attractions include traditional bumper cars, helter skelters, funhouses, ghost trains, teacups and waltzers. There are several family stalls (such as Hook-a-duck) with prizes to be won, and a giant ferris wheel that provides an aerial view of the fair. Conventional fairground food and refreshments are also on sale throughout the fair, including hot dogs, candy floss, doughnuts, and mushy peas with mint sauce.

==In art and popular culture==

* Nottingham artist Noel Denholm Davis painted &quot;Nottingham Goose Fair&quot; in 1910; his painting is held at the Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery. Another artist from Nottingham, Arthur Spooner, painted &quot;The Goose Fair, Nottingham&quot; in 1926. The painting was sold at Christie&#x27;s in 2004 for over £200,000 and is also now displayed at Nottingham Castle.
* While living in London between 1908 and 1912, the writer D. H. Lawrence would return home to Nottingham every year to visit the Goose Fair. In 1910, he wrote a short story called &quot;Goose Fair&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;The English Review&quot; in February 1910 and was included in his collection, &quot;The Prussian Officer and Other Stories&quot;, in 1914.
* In the novel &quot;Goose Fair&quot;, Cecil Roberts presents a derisive portrayal of the fair: &quot;Every first Thursday in October, following the custom of centuries, the good people of the city whose Sheriff was so soundly abused by Robin Hood, take leave of their senses.&quot; Originally published in the United States in 1928, the novel was also published in England in the same year with the title &quot;David and Diana&quot;, the names of the book&#x27;s main characters.
* &quot;English Journey&quot; by J. B. Priestley, published in 1934, chronicles the author&#x27;s travels around England the previous year. It contains a particularly scathing account of his visit to Goose Fair, which he describes as a &quot;crushing mass of gaping and sweating humanity&quot; ... &quot;contrived to attract the largest number of pennies in the shortest possible time.&quot;
* Goose Fair has been used in television programmes, as well as in films such as &quot;The Woman for Joe&quot; (1955), &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960) and &quot;Weekend&quot; (2011).
* The short story &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, written by Alan Sillitoe in 1991, is set in Nottingham&#x27;s Goose Fair. and the fair features in &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; by the same author
* &quot;Goose Fair Night&quot; is a 2016 collection of poems written by Kathy Pimlott, which contains the author&#x27;s reflections on places in and around Nottingham, including the annual Goose Fair.
* The final movement of Symphony No. 2 &quot;The Nottingham Symphony&quot; by Alan Bush is entitled &quot;Goose Fair&quot;.
* The album cover for Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s debut album On Avery Island features a colored picture of the Goose fair taken in presumably 1910

<text>Phelsuma pusilla hallmanni is a diurnal subspecies of gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The subspecies is endemic to eastern Madagascar and typically inhabits different trees. This day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The subspecific name, &quot;hallmanni&quot;, is in honor of German herpetologist Gerhard Hallmann.

==Description==
&quot;Ph. p. hallmanni&quot; belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a total length (including tail) of about . 

The body colour is dark green. On the back there are red dots present. On the snout, a blue triangle is present, which is bordered from behind by a red bar. On the neck and back of the head bluish speckles are present. The tail is turquoise. The flanks are brown or black. The ventral side is white.

==Geographic range==
The subspecies &quot;Ph. p. hallmanni&quot; inhabits the east coast of Madagascar. It is only known from the region around Andasibe.

==Habitat==
&quot;Ph. p. hallmanni&quot; lives in a moist and warm climate. It inhabits different trees and can often be found on trees on the edge of forest along the road.

==Diet==
&quot;Ph. p. hallmanni&quot; feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also likes to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
&quot;Ph. p. hallmanni&quot; is quite quarrelsome and does not accept other males. In captivity, where the female cannot escape, the male can also sometimes seriously wound a female. In this case the male and female must be separated.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Ph. p. hallmanni&quot; is oviparous. The pairing season is between October and the first weeks of May.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
&quot;Ph. p. hallmanni&quot; should be housed in pairs and needs a well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about 28 °C (82 °F), locally around 30 °C (86 °F), during the day, and drop to around 20 °C (68 °F) at night. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 80% during the day. It is also important to include two colder months with a daytime temperature of 24 °C (75 °F) and 16 °C (61 °F) at night. In captivity, it can be fed crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>The Republic and Canton of Neuchâtel (; ; ; ) is a mostly French-speaking canton in western Switzerland. In 2007, its population was 169,782, of whom 39,654 (or 23.4%) were foreigners. The capital is Neuchâtel.

==History==
===County of Neuchâtel===

Neuchâtel has a unique history as the only part of present-day Switzerland to enter the Confederation as a principality (on 19 May 1815).

Its first recorded ruler, Rudolph III of Burgundy, mentioned Neuchâtel in his will in 1032. The dynasty of Ulrich count of Fenis (Hasenburg) took over the town and its territories in 1034. The dynasty prospered and, by 1373, all the lands now part of the canton belonged to the count. In 1405, the cities of Bern and Neuchâtel entered a union. The lands of Neuchâtel had passed to the Zähringen lords of Freiburg in the late 14th century as inheritance from the childless Elisabeth, Countess of Neuchâtel, to her nephews, and then in 1458 to margraves of Sausenburg who belonged to the House of Baden.

Their heiress, Johanna of Hachberg-Sausenberg (Jehanne de Hochberg), and her husband, Louis I d&#x27;Orléans, duc de Longueville, inherited it in 1504, after which the French house of Orléans-Longueville (Valois-Dunois). Neuchâtel&#x27;s Swiss allies then occupied it from 1512 to 1529 before returning it to its widowed countess.

The French preacher Guillaume Farel brought the teachings of the Protestant Reformation to the area in 1530. Therefore, when the house of Orléans-Longueville became extinct with Marie d&#x27;Orléans-Longueville&#x27;s death in 1707, Neuchâtel was Protestant, and looked to avoid passing to a Catholic ruler. The rightful heiress in primogeniture from Jeanne de Hachberg was Paule de Gondi, Duchess of Retz, who was Catholic. The people of Neuchâtel chose Princess Marie&#x27;s successor from among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices. King Louis XIV of France actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but the Neuchâtelois people in the final decision in 1708 passed them over in favour of the Protestant King Frederick I of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion through the House of Orange and Nassau, who were not even descended from Jeanne de Hachberg.

Frederick I and his successors ruled the Principality of Neuchâtel () in personal union with Prussia from 1708 until 1806 and again from 1814 until 1857.
Napoleon Bonaparte deposed King Frederick William III of Prussia as prince of Neuchâtel and appointed instead his chief of staff Louis Alexandre Berthier. Starting in 1807, the principality provided Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée with a battalion of rangers. The rangers were nicknamed &quot;Canaris&quot; (i.e. canaries) because of their yellow uniforms.

After the Liberation Wars the principality was restored to Frederick William III in 1814.
The &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; (state council, i.e. government of Neuchâtel) addressed him in May 1814 requesting the permission to establish a special battalion, a &quot;Bataillon de Chasseurs&quot;, for the service of his majesty. Frederick William III then established by his &quot;most-supreme cabinet order&quot; (&quot;Allerhöchste Cabinets-Ordre&quot;, A.C.O.), issued in Paris on 19 May 1814, the Bataillon des Tirailleurs de la Garde following the same principles as with the Neuchâtel battalion within the Grande Armée. The Conseil d&#x27;Etat of Neuchâtel had the right of nomination for the battalion&#x27;s officers. The commander was the battalion&#x27;s only officer chosen by the monarch.

A year later he agreed to allow the principality to join the Swiss Confederation, then not yet an integrated federation, but a confederacy, as a full member. Thus Neuchâtel became the first and only monarchy to join the otherwise entirely republican Swiss cantons. This situation changed in 1848 when a peaceful revolution took place and established a republic, in the same year that the modern Swiss Confederation was transformed into a federation. King Frederick William IV of Prussia did not cede immediately, and several attempts at counter-revolution took place, culminating in the Neuchâtel Crisis of 1856–57. In 1857, Frederick William finally renounced the monarchy&#x27;s claim on the area.
==Geography==

The canton of Neuchâtel is located in Romandy, the French-speaking western part of Switzerland. It is also located in the Jura mountainous region. To its northeast it borders the canton of Bern, to the northwest France (Bourgogne-Franche-Comté). Lake Neuchâtel lies southeast of the canton, while the canton of Vaud is southwest of the canton of Neuchâtel. The canton lies in the central area of the Jura Mountains. Lake Neuchâtel drains the lands in the south, whilst the river Doubs drains the northern areas.

The canton is commonly divided into three regions. The viticultural region is located along the lake. Its name derives from the many vineyards found there. The region called &quot;Les Vallées&quot; lies further north. The two largest valleys of the canton of Neuchâtel lie in this region: the &quot;Ruz Valley&quot; and the &quot;Val de Travers&quot;. Both valleys lie at about . The highest region of the canton, however, is the &quot;Neuchâtelois Mountains&quot; at to . This region is made up of a long valley, home to La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle and La Brévine.

==Government==

Neuchâtel was one of the first cantons in Switzerland to grant women the right to vote (1959) and also to grant the vote to foreigners holding a residence permit and who have been domiciled in the canton for at least five years (2002), as well as to lower the voting age to 18.

The legislature, the Grand Council of Neuchâtel, has 115 seats distributed in proportion to the population of the six districts that make up the electoral constituencies: Neuchâtel (35 seats), Boudry (25), Val-de-Travers (8), Val-de-Ruz (10), Le Locle (10), La Chaux-de-Fonds (27). The State Council (cantonal government), five &quot;ministers&quot; who assume the annual presidency in turn and manage the departments of justice, health and safety; finance and social welfare; public economy; regional management; education and culture. The cantonal authorities, which have their seat in the castle (the Château de Neuchâtel), are elected every four years by universal suffrage.

The people also elect their representatives to the federal parliament every four years: five of the 200 members of the National Council (lower chamber) and two of the 46 members of the Council of States (upper chamber).

===Districts===

Until 2018 the Canton was divided into six districts. On 1 January 2018 the districts were dissolved and all municipalities were placed directly under the canton.

*Boudry with capital Boudry
*La Chaux-de-Fonds with capital La Chaux-de-Fonds
*Le Locle with capital Le Locle
*Neuchâtel with capital Neuchâtel
*Val-de-Ruz with capital Cernier
*Val-de-Travers with capital Val-de-Travers

===Municipalities===

There are 24 municipalities in the canton ().

==Demographics==

The population is almost entirely French-speaking. The canton has historically been strongly Protestant, but in recent decades it has received an influx of Roman Catholic arrivals, notably from Portugal and Italy. In 2000, its population was closely split between Protestants (38%) and Roman Catholics (31%).

The inhabitants () are fairly evenly distributed with many small towns and villages lining the shore of the Lake of Neuchâtel. The average population density is . Neuchâtel ( population: ) is the canton&#x27;s capital while La Chaux-de-Fonds ( population: ) is the canton&#x27;s largest settlement. Some 38,000 of the inhabitants, or a little less than a quarter of the population, are of foreign origin.

=== Historical population ===
The historical population is given in the following table:
==Economy==
The canton is well known for its wines, which are grown along the Lake Neuchâtel shore, and for its absinthe. The Val-de-Travers is famous as the birthplace of absinthe, which has now been re-legalized both in Switzerland and globally. There are dairy farming and cattle breeding in the valleys, but it is for the breeding of horses that Neuchâtel has a fine reputation. Watchmaking is well-established in the canton, with fine mechanics and microchip production being established more recently. Higher educational institutions include Haute école Arc (representing Bern, Jura and Neuchâtel) and the University of Neuchâtel.

<text>The Communist Party of Scotland (CPS; &quot;Pàrtaidh Co-Mhaoineach na h-Alba&quot;) was a communist political party based in Scotland. It was established in January 1992 by former members of the Communist Party of Great Britain who disagreed with the CPGB&#x27;s disbanding and reforming in 1991 as the Democratic Left think-tank. The party was itself dissolved in the late 2010s.

== History ==
The CPS was set up in mid-January 1992 by former CPGB members who disagreed with the party&#x27;s dissolution. The party headquarters at its founding were based in Partick, Glasgow.

Leading members of the CPGB in Scotland joined the new party, including Mick McGahey, who had been a leading member of the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1970s and 1980s, and former CPGB General Secretary Gordon McLennan. Willie Clarke, a CPGB councillor in Fife since 1973, joined the CPS but sat as an Independent councillor until his resignation on the grounds of ill health in 2016.

Unlike the Communist Party of Britain (CPB), which broke away from the CPGB in 1988, the CPS supported Scottish independence and pro-independence initiatives like the Scottish Independence Convention (SIC) and Independence First. In 2007, the CPS published a discussion pamphlet titled &quot;Perspectives for Scottish Independence&quot; with contributions from Eric Canning, Maggie Chetty and Rhona Fleming. In 2008, the CPS organised a conference aimed at &quot;uniting the left in Scotland around a number of shared political positions on Scottish independence&quot;.

Canning died in December 2017 while in office as national secretary of the CPS. The Scottish Socialist Party paid tribute to his &quot;unshakeable commitment to the cause of socialism and independence&quot;.

<doc id="321727" wikidata="Q212721" url="?curid=321727" title="Lacrimal bone">
<text>The lacrimal bones are two small and fragile bones of the facial skeleton; they are roughly the size of the little fingernail and situated at the front part of the medial wall of the orbit. They each have two surfaces and four borders. Several bony landmarks of the lacrimal bones function in the process of lacrimation. Specifically, the lacrimal bones help form the nasolacrimal canal necessary for tear translocation. A depression on the anterior inferior portion of one bone, the lacrimal fossa, houses the membranous lacrimal sac. Tears, from the lacrimal glands, collect in this sac during excessive lacrimation. The fluid then flows through the nasolacrimal duct and into the nasopharynx. This drainage results in what is commonly referred to a runny nose during excessive crying or tear production. Injury or fracture of the lacrimal bone can result in posttraumatic obstruction of the lacrimal pathways.

==Structure==

===Lateral or orbital surface===
The lateral or orbital surface is divided by a vertical ridge, the posterior lacrimal crest, into two parts.

In &quot;front&quot; of this crest is a longitudinal groove, the lacrimal sulcus (&quot;sulcus lacrimalis&quot;), the inner margin of which unites with the frontal process of the maxilla, and the lacrimal fossa is thus completed. The upper part of this fossa lodges the lacrimal sac, the lower part, the nasolacrimal duct.

The portion &quot;behind&quot; the crest is smooth, and forms part of the medial wall of the orbit.

The crest, with a part of the orbital surface immediately behind it, gives origin to the lacrimal part of the orbicularis oculi and ends below in a small, hook-like projection, the lacrimal hamulus, which articulates with the lacrimal tubercle of the maxilla, and completes the upper orifice of the nasolacrimal canal; the hamulus sometimes exists as a separate piece, and is then called the lesser lacrimal bone.

===Medial or nasal surface===
The medial or nasal surface presents a longitudinal furrow, corresponding to the crest on the lateral surface.

The area in front of this furrow forms part of the middle meatus of the nose. The area behind it articulates with the ethmoid, and completes some of the anterior ethmoidal cells.

===Borders===
Of the four borders:
* the &quot;anterior&quot; articulates with the frontal process of the maxilla;
* the &quot;posterior&quot; with the lamina papyracea of the ethmoid;
* the &quot;superior&quot; with the frontal bone.
* The &quot;inferior&quot; is divided by the lower edge of the posterior lacrimal crest into two parts:
** the posterior part articulates with the orbital plate of the maxilla;
** the anterior is prolonged downward as the descending process, which articulates with the lacrimal process of the inferior nasal concha, and assists in forming the canal for the nasolacrimal duct.

===Development===
The lacrimal is ossified from a single center, which appears about the twelfth week in the membrane covering the cartilaginous nasal capsule.

===Articulations===
The lacrimal articulates with four bones: two of the neurocranium, the frontal and ethmoid, and two of the viscerocranium, the maxilla and the inferior nasal concha.

==Other animals==

In early lobe-finned fishes and ancestral tetrapods, the lacrimal bone is a relatively large and robust bone, running from the orbit to the nostrils. It forms part of the side of the face, between the nasal bones and the maxilla. In primitive forms, it is often accompanied by a much smaller septomaxilla bone, lying immediately behind the nasal opening, but this is lost in most modern species. The lacrimal bone is often smaller in living vertebrates, and is no longer always directly associated with the nasal opening, although it retains its connection with the orbit. The bone is entirely absent in living amphibians, as well as some reptilian species.

=== Dinosaurs ===
In dinosaurs, the lacrimal bone usually defines the anterior rim of the orbit (eye socket), and the posterior rim of the antorbital fenestra. In some theropods (e.g. &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;) the upper part of the lacrimal bone grew in such a manner as to form a horn on the top of the dinosaur&#x27;s head, usually situated above, and anterior to the eye. In many dinosaurs, the lacrimal bone comes into contact with the nasal bone, the jugal bone, the prefrontal bone, and the maxillary and premaxillary bones. The boundaries where some of these bones meet with the others are called sutures. Rarely, the lacrimal bones fused with the nasal bones to form a pair of &quot;nasolacrimal&quot; crests, which are present in dinosaurs such as &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; and &quot;Sinosaurus&quot;.

<text>Britten-Norman (BN) is a privately owned British aircraft manufacturer and aviation services provider. The company is the sole independent commercial aircraft producer in the United Kingdom.

Britten-Norman has so far manufactured and sold its aircraft to customers in more than 120 countries. In addition to aircraft manufacturing, the company also performs maintenance, overhaul and repair work as well as performing sub-contract engineering and design work.

The company&#x27;s historic home is located at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight although airframes have been assembled under subcontract in Romania for more than 50 years. Romanian aircraft used to pass through to the UK for finalisation and certification. Nowadays aircraft are manufactured in the UK at the company&#x27;s Lee-on-the-Solent manufacturing facility at Daedalus Airfield, a former Royal Naval Air Station. Spare parts production continues at the Bembridge site with sub assemblies also being supplied from the Romanian facility.

The company manufactures such aircraft as the Islander and the militarised Defender both of which are capable of short take-off and landing (STOL) operations. The three-engined Trislander is still operating but is not currently being manufactured. The aircraft are typically used for inter-island schedules.

==History==
John Britten and Desmond Norman started developing crop-spraying equipment in the middle 1950s and used de Havilland Tiger Moths (modified at their factory near Ventnor, Isle of Wight) for a contract in Sudan. After that, Britten and Norman (who had both trained with De Havilland) turned their hand to aircraft design.

Their first design was the Britten-Norman BN-1 Finibee, a light single-seater parasol wing aircraft. They pitched the design to several aircraft companies but found no one willing to produce the design.

Britten and Norman made a detailed analysis of the aviation market and decided there was a demand for a twin-engined utility aircraft with the minimum of complex systems that could operate from short, rough airstrips and also be used for high-density commuter flights. This brief developed into the BN-2 Islander, and the Britten-Norman company was formed to produce the aircraft, which first flew in 1965.

During the 1960s, Britten-Norman were involved in the development of hovercraft via their subsidiary Cushioncraft Ltd; their first craft, the CC1, was the world&#x27;s second hovercraft.

Desmond Norman then designed a four-seater touring aircraft to compete with established types such as the Cessna 172 and Piper Cherokee. A single prototype of the BN-3 &#x27;Nymph&#x27; was built and flown in 1969, but failed to attract significant orders. Norman set up his own company to build the plane, renamed the &#x27;Freelance&#x27; and produced components and fuselage sections for six aircraft. However, orders were still not forthcoming and, following failure to win a military order for the &#x27;Firecracker&#x27; design, Norman&#x27;s company closed. After Norman&#x27;s death in 2002, his son has overseen the completion of one of the Freelances to airworthy condition, and plans to assemble and sell the other five, with the possibility of full-scale production.

Following the failure of the &#x27;Nymph&#x27;, Britten-Norman continued to develop and improve the Islander design, which was enjoying great success. This culminated in 1970 with the Trislander, a trimotor version with greater range and capacity. In 1975 Britten-Norman won the Queen&#x27;s Award to Industry for technological innovation for the Trislander.

Ownership of the company has passed through a number of hands. The Fairey Aviation group acquired Britten-Norman in 1973. Following financial troubles at Fairey the company was sold to Oerlikon-Bührle (owner of Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland in 1978, hence the &quot;Pilatus Britten-Norman&quot; designation of some of the aircraft). Oerlikon-Bührle sold Britten-Norman to Litchfield Continental / Biofarm Inc. (BIOF). B-N Group acquired the assets of Britten-Norman in 2000.

In March 2024, the company announced it had secured new investment from a group of investors led by 4D Capital Partners LLP.

<doc id="321734" wikidata="Q152187" url="?curid=321734" title="August Krogh">
<text>Schack August Steenberg Krogh (15 November 1874 – 13 September 1949) was a Danish professor at the department of zoophysiology at the University of Copenhagen from 1916 to 1945. He contributed a number of fundamental discoveries within several fields of physiology, and is famous for developing Krogh&#x27;s principle.

In 1920 August Krogh was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the mechanism of regulation of the capillaries in skeletal muscle. Krogh was first to describe the adaptation of blood perfusion in muscle and other organs according to demands through opening and closing the arterioles and capillaries.

Besides his contributions to medicine, Krogh was also one of the founders of what is today the Novo Nordisk company.

==Life==
He was born in Grenaa on the peninsula of Djursland in Denmark, the son of Viggo Krogh, a shipbuilder. His mother (born Drechmann) was the daughter of a customs officer in Holstein. Through his mother’s family he claimed &quot;a dash of&quot; Romani blood . Krogh was educated at the Aarhus Katedralskole in Aarhus. He attended the University of Copenhagen graduating MSc in 1899 and gaining a doctorate PhD in 1903.

Krogh was a pioneer in comparative physiology. He wrote his thesis on the respiration through the skin and lungs in frogs: &quot;Respiratory Exchange of Animals&quot;, 1915. Later Krogh took on studies of water and electrolyte homeostasis of aquatic animals and he published the books: &quot;Osmotic Regulation&quot; (1939) and &quot;Comparative Physiology of Respiratory Mechanisms&quot; (1941). He contributed more than 200 research articles in international journals. He was a constructor of scientific instruments of which several had considerable practical importance, such as the spirometer and the apparatus for measuring basal metabolic rate.

Krogh began lecturing in the University of Copenhagen in 1908 and in 1916 was promoted to full professor, becoming the head of the first laboratory for animal physiology (zoophysiology) at the university.

Krogh was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1931, an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1937, and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1941.

Krogh and his wife Marie, scientist in her own right, brought insulin to Denmark shortly after its discovery in 1922 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie, a doctor who had patients with type 1 diabetes, was herself suffering from type 2 diabetes and was naturally very interested in the disease. Together with doctor Hans Christian Hagedorn, August and Marie Krogh founded Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium, where Krogh made decisive contributions to establishing a Danish production of insulin by ethanol extraction of the hormone from the pancreatic glands of pigs.

In the 1930s, Krogh worked with two other Nobel prizewinners, the radiochemist George de Hevesy and the physicist Niels Bohr on the permeability of membranes to heavy water and radioactive isotopes, and together, they managed to obtain Denmark&#x27;s first cyclotron for experiments on animal and plant physiology as well as in dental and medical work.

==Family==
He married Marie Krogh (née Jørgensen, 1874–1943) in 1905. She was a renowned scientist in her own right and much of August Krogh&#x27;s work was carried out in close collaboration with her.

August and Marie had four children, the youngest of whom, Bodil, was born in 1918. She too was a physiologist, and became the first woman president of the American Physiological Society in 1975. Bodil married another eminent physiologist, Knut Schmidt-Nielsen.

==Legacy==
Torkel Weis-Fogh, an eminent pioneer on the study of insect flight, was a student of August Krogh&#x27;s. Together they wrote a classic paper on that subject in 1951.

Krogh&#x27;s name is preserved in two items now named for him: 
* Krogh length, the distance between capillaries which nutrients diffuse to, based on cellular consumption of the nutrients.
* Krogh&#x27;s principle, that &quot;for... a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied.&quot;
He via his book, &quot;The Anatomy and Physiology of Capillaries&quot;, popularized the false belief that if you were to lay out all the blood vessels from a human body they would reach 100,000 km in length. He made false assumptions about cappilary density while also using a hypothetical body that weighed 140 kg with 50 kg of pure muscle, an unrealistic physique, to get his round figure of 100,000 km. Recent finding suggest that the actual figure is somewhere between 9,000–19,000 km.

<text>Kelvin Anderson (born February 4, 1972) is an American former professional football player. As a running back, he rushed for over 1,000 yards in eight consecutive seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL), a league record. He won the CFL&#x27;s Grey Cup championship twice, as a member of the Calgary Stampeders, in 1998 and 2001.

Anderson played football at New Madrid County Central High School. He played college football at Southeast Missouri State where he earned the nickname &quot;Earthquake&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s eight consecutive 1,000 yard seasons began in 1996 with the Calgary Stampeders. In 2000, he played in 15 games for Calgary, and ran for 1,048 yards and scored six touchdowns. He caught 34 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns, and captured the Eddie James Memorial Trophy as the Western Division&#x27;s top rusher. In 2001 he was named a Western All-Star for the fifth consecutive season, and was named a CFL All-Star for the third time in his career, and ran for a career-high 1,383 yards and six touchdowns. Anderson also caught 48 passes for 433 yards and nine touchdowns. Anderson also played in the only XFL season in 2001 for the San Francisco Demons, leading the team in rushing with 228 yards.

Anderson had played all of his CFL career with the Calgary Stampeders when he was released by them prior to the 2003 season in favor of Lawrence Phillips. Anderson signed with the BC Lions, following head coach and general manager Wally Buono who had also been let go by Calgary. With the Lions in 2003, he rushed for over 1,000 yards for the eighth consecutive season, setting a league record. He retired just prior the 2004 CFL season. Antonio Warren succeeded him as the Lions&#x27; starting running back.

Anderson was inducted to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2017.

<text>Mittweida () is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts Muldentalkreis, Döbeln, Freiberg, the district-free city Chemnitz and the district Chemnitzer Land, the district Altenburger Land in Thuringia and the district Leipziger Land.

== History ==
In 1994 the district was created, when the previous districts Hainichen, Rochlitz and part the district Chemnitz were merged. In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Döbeln, Freiberg and Mittweida were merged into the new district Mittelsachsen.

== Geography ==
The district was located in the foothills of the Ore Mountains, only the area in the northwest around Rochlitz belongs to the Leipzig Bay. In this area is also the lowest elevation with 144 m above sea level; the highest elevation is in Hausdorf (part of Frankenberg) with 488 m.
The three main rivers in the district are the Zwickauer Mulde, Chemnitz and Zschopau.

<doc id="321787" wikidata="Q276826" url="?curid=321787" title="UTF-7">
<text>UTF-7 (7-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is an obsolete variable-length character encoding for representing Unicode text using a stream of ASCII characters. It was originally intended to provide a means of encoding Unicode text for use in Internet E-mail messages that was more efficient than the combination of UTF-8 with quoted-printable.

UTF-7 (according to its RFC) isn&#x27;t a &quot;Unicode Transformation Format&quot;, as the definition can only encode code points in the BMP (the first 65536 Unicode code points, which does not include emojis and many other characters). However if a UTF-7 translator is to/from UTF-16 then it can (and probably does) encode each surrogate half as though it was a 16-bit code point, and thus can encode all code points. It is unclear if other UTF-7 software (such as translators to UTF-32 or UTF-8) support this.

UTF-7 has never been an official standard of the Unicode Consortium. It is known to have security issues, which is why software has been changed to disable its use. It is prohibited in HTML 5.

==Motivation==
MIME, the modern standard for e-mail formats, forbids encoding of headers using byte values above the ASCII range. Although MIME allows encoding the message body in various character sets (broader than ASCII), the underlying transmission infrastructure (SMTP, the main E-mail transfer standard) is still not guaranteed to be 8-bit clean. Therefore, a non-trivial content transfer encoding has to be applied in case of doubt. Unfortunately, Base64 has a disadvantage of making even ASCII characters unreadable in non-MIME clients. On the other hand, UTF-8 combined with quoted-printable produces a very size-inefficient format requiring 6–9 bytes for non-ASCII characters from the BMP and 12 bytes for characters outside the BMP.

Provided certain rules are followed during encoding, UTF-7 can be sent in e-mail without using an underlying MIME transfer encoding, but still must be explicitly identified as the text character set. In addition, if used within e-mail headers such as &quot;Subject:&quot;, UTF-7 must be contained in MIME encoded words identifying the character set. Since encoded words force use of either quoted-printable or Base64, UTF-7 was designed to avoid using the = sign as an escape character to avoid double escaping when it is combined with quoted-printable (or its variant, the RFC 2047/1522 &quot;Q&quot;-encoding of headers).

UTF-7 is generally not used as a native representation within applications as it is very awkward to process. Despite its size advantage over the combination of UTF-8 with either quoted-printable or Base64, the now defunct Internet Mail Consortium recommended against its use.

8BITMIME has also been introduced, which reduces the need to encode message bodies in a 7-bit format.

A modified form of UTF-7 (sometimes dubbed &#x27;mUTF-7&#x27;) was used in the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) e-mail retrieval protocol, version 4 rev 1, for &quot;international&quot; mailbox names. 
The following version, IMAP version 4 rev 2, uses UTF-8 instead.

==Description==
UTF-7 was first proposed as an experimental protocol in RFC 1642, &quot;A Mail-Safe Transformation Format of Unicode&quot;. This RFC has been made obsolete by RFC 2152, an informational RFC which never became a standard. As RFC 2152 clearly states, the RFC &quot;does not specify an Internet standard of any kind&quot;. Despite this, RFC 2152 is quoted as the definition of UTF-7 in the IANA&#x27;s list of charsets. Neither is UTF-7 a Unicode Standard. &quot;The Unicode Standard 5.0&quot; only lists UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
There is also a modified version, specified in RFC 2060, which is sometimes identified as UTF-7.

Some characters can be represented directly as single ASCII bytes. The first group is known as &quot;direct characters&quot; and contains 62 alphanumeric characters and 9 symbols: codice_1. The direct characters are safe to include literally. The other main group, known as &quot;optional direct characters&quot;, contains all other printable characters in the range –U+007E except codice_2 and space (the characters and being excluded due to being redefined in &quot;variants of ASCII&quot; such as JIS-Roman). Using the optional direct characters reduces size and enhances human readability but also increases the chance of breakage by things like badly designed mail gateways and may require extra escaping when used in encoded words for header fields.

Space, tab, carriage return and line feed may also be represented directly as single ASCII bytes. However, if the encoded text is to be used in e-mail, care is needed to ensure that these characters are used in ways that do not require further content transfer encoding to be suitable for e-mail. The plus sign (codice_3) &quot;may&quot; be encoded as codice_4.

Other characters must be encoded in UTF-16 (hence U+10000 and higher would be encoded into two surrogates), and then in modified Base64. The start of these blocks of modified Base64-encoded UTF-16 is indicated by a codice_3 sign. The end is indicated by any character not in the modified Base64 set. If the character after the modified Base64 is a codice_6 (ASCII hyphen-minus) then it is consumed by the decoder and decoding resumes with the next character. Otherwise decoding resumes with the character after the Base64.

==Examples==
* &quot;codice_7&quot; is encoded as &quot;codice_8&quot;
* &quot;codice_9&quot; is encoded as &quot;codice_10&quot;
* &quot;codice_11&quot; is encoded as &quot;codice_12&quot;. The Unicode code point for the pound sign is U+00A3 which converts into modified Base64 as in the table below. There are two bits left over, which are padded to 0.
==Algorithm for encoding and decoding==

===Encoding===
First, an encoder must decide which characters to represent directly in ASCII form, which codice_3 have to be escaped as codice_4, and which to place in blocks of Unicode characters. The expansion cost of UTF-7 can be high: for example, the character sequence U+10FFFF U+0077 U+10FFFF is 9 bytes in UTF-8, but 17 bytes in UTF-7. (At worst, treating every codepoint as a sequence in its own right produces the maximum expansion of 5x, e.g. when encoding codice_15 as codice_16.) Each Unicode sequence must be encoded using the following procedure, then surrounded by the appropriate delimiters.

Using the £† (U+00A3 U+2020) character sequence as an example:

===Decoding===
First an encoded data must be separated into plain ASCII text chunks (including +es followed by a dash) and nonempty Unicode blocks as mentioned in the description section. Once this is done, each Unicode block must be decoded with the following procedure (using the result of the encoding example above as our example)

#Express each Base64 code as the bit sequence it represents:&lt;samp&gt;AKMgIA → 000000 001010 001100 100000 001000 000000&lt;/samp&gt;
#Regroup the binary into groups of sixteen bits, starting from the left:&lt;samp&gt;000000 001010 001100 100000 001000 000000 → 0000000010100011 0010000000100000 0000&lt;/samp&gt;
#If there is an incomplete group at the end containing only zeros, discard it (if the incomplete group contains any ones, the code is invalid):&lt;samp&gt;0000000010100011 0010000000100000&lt;/samp&gt;
#Each group of 16 bits is a character&#x27;s Unicode (UTF-16) number and can be expressed in other forms:&lt;samp&gt;0000 0000 1010 0011 ≡ 0x00A3 ≡ 16310&lt;/samp&gt;

==Byte order mark==
A byte order mark (BOM) is an optional special byte sequence at the very start of a stream or file that, without being data itself, indicates the encoding used for the data that follows; it can be used in the absence of metadata that denotes the encoding. For a given encoding scheme, it&#x27;s that scheme&#x27;s representation of Unicode code point codice_17.

While it&#x27;s typically a single, fixed byte sequence, in UTF-7 four variations may appear, because the last 2 bits of the 4th byte of the UTF-7 encoding of codice_17 belong to the &quot;following&quot; character, resulting in 4 possible bit patterns and therefore 4 different possible bytes in the 4th position. See the UTF-7 entry in the table of Unicode byte order marks.

==Security==
UTF-7 allows multiple representations of the same source string. In particular, ASCII characters can be represented as part of Unicode blocks. As such, if standard ASCII-based escaping or validation processes are used on strings that may be later interpreted as UTF-7, then Unicode blocks may be used to slip malicious strings past them. To mitigate this problem, systems should perform decoding before validation and should avoid attempting to autodetect UTF-7.

Older versions of Internet Explorer can be tricked into interpreting the page as UTF-7. This can be used for a cross-site scripting attack as the codice_19 and codice_20 marks can be encoded as codice_21 and codice_22 in UTF-7, which most validators let through as simple text.

UTF-7 is considered obsolete, at least for Microsoft software (.NET), with code paths previously supporting it intentionally broken (to prevent security issues) in .NET 5, in 2020.

<doc id="321788" wikidata="Q552439" url="?curid=321788" title="Inferior nasal concha">
<text>The inferior nasal concha (inferior turbinated bone or inferior turbinal/turbinate) is one of the three paired nasal conchae in the nose. It extends horizontally along the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and consists of a of spongy bone, curled upon itself like a scroll, (&quot;turbinate&quot; meaning inverted cone). The inferior nasal conchae are considered a pair of facial bones. As the air passes through the turbinates, the air is churned against these mucosa-lined bones in order to receive warmth, moisture and cleansing. Superior to inferior nasal concha are the middle nasal concha and superior nasal concha which both arise from the ethmoid bone, of the cranial portion of the skull. Hence, these two are considered as a part of the cranial bones.

It has two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.

==Structure==
===Surfaces===
The medial surface is , perforated by numerous apertures, and traversed by longitudinal grooves for the lodgement of vessels.

The lateral surface is , and forms part of the inferior meatus.

===Borders===
Its upper border is thin, irregular, and connected to various bones along the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.

It may be divided into three portions: of these,
* the &quot;anterior&quot; articulates with the conchal crest of the maxilla;
* the &quot;posterior&quot; with the conchal crest of the palatine;
* the &quot;middle&quot; portion presents three well-marked processes, which vary much in their size and form.
** Of these, the anterior or lacrimal process is small and pointed and is situated at the junction of the anterior fourth with the posterior three-fourths of the bone: it articulates, by its apex, with the descending process of the lacrimal bone, and, by its margins, with the groove on the back of the frontal process of the maxilla, and thus assists in forming the canal for the nasolacrimal duct.
** Behind this process a broad, thin plate, the ethmoidal process, ascends to join the uncinate process of the ethmoid; from its lower border a thin lamina, the maxillary process, curves downward and lateralward; it articulates with the maxilla and forms a part of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus.

The inferior border is free, thick, and cellular in structure, more especially in the middle of the bone.

===Extremities===
Both extremities are more or less pointed, the posterior being the more tapering.

===Development===
The inferior nasal concha is ossified from a single center, which appears about the fifth month of fetal life in the lateral wall of the cartilaginous nasal capsule.

The entire inferior concha may be absent in some people. This is a consequence of embryologic agenesis and is a normal anatomic variant.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Dysfunction ===
Large, swollen inferior turbinates may lead to blockage of nasal breathing. Allergies, exposure to environmental irritants, or a persistent inflammation within the sinuses can lead to turbinate swelling. Deformity of the nasal septum can also result in enlarged turbinates.

Treatment of the underlying allergy or irritant may reduce turbinate swelling. In cases that do not resolve, or for treatment of deviated septum, turbinate surgery may be required.

=== Surgery ===
Inferior turbinate reduction is a surgery to reduce the size of the inferior turbinates. There are different techniques, including bipolar radiofrequency ablation (also known as somnoplasty), electrocautery, and use of cold steel instruments (eg, microdebrider). Inferior turbinectomy is a surgery to remove the inferior turbinates.

In the case of turbinate reduction, only small amounts of turbinate tissue are removed because the turbinates are essential for respiration. Turbinectomy is usually reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms despite previous turbinate reduction surgery. Risks of reduction of the inferior or middle turbinates include empty nose syndrome.

<text>In mathematics, a Cunningham chain is a certain sequence of prime numbers. Cunningham chains are named after mathematician A. J. C. Cunningham. They are also called chains of nearly doubled primes. 

==Definition==

A Cunningham chain of the first kind of length &quot;n&quot; is a sequence of prime numbers (&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;) such that &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 = 2&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; + 1 for all 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;. (Hence each term of such a chain except the last is a Sophie Germain prime, and each term except the first is a safe prime).

It follows that

: formula_1

or, by setting formula_2 (the number formula_3 is not part of the sequence and need not be a prime number), we have formula_4

Similarly, a Cunningham chain of the second kind of length &quot;n&quot; is a sequence of prime numbers (&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;) such that &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 = 2&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; − 1 for all 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;.

It follows that the general term is

: formula_5

Now, by setting formula_6, we have formula_7.

Cunningham chains are also sometimes generalized to sequences of prime numbers (&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;) such that &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 = &quot;ap&quot;&quot;i&quot; + &quot;b&quot; for all 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; for fixed coprime integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;; the resulting chains are called generalized Cunningham chains.

A Cunningham chain is called complete if it cannot be further extended, i.e., if the previous and the next terms in the chain are not prime numbers.

==Examples==

Examples of complete Cunningham chains of the first kind include these:

: 2, 5, 11, 23, 47 (The next number would be 95, but that is not prime.)
: 3, 7 (The next number would be 15, but that is not prime.)
: 29, 59 (The next number would be 119, but that is not prime.)
: 41, 83, 167 (The next number would be 335, but that is not prime.)
: 89, 179, 359, 719, 1439, 2879 (The next number would be 5759, but that is not prime.)

Examples of complete Cunningham chains of the second kind include these:

: 2, 3, 5 (The next number would be 9, but that is not prime.)
: 7, 13 (The next number would be 25, but that is not prime.)
: 19, 37, 73 (The next number would be 145, but that is not prime.)
: 31, 61 (The next number would be 121 = 112, but that is not prime.)

Cunningham chains are now considered useful in cryptographic systems since &quot;they provide two concurrent suitable settings for the ElGamal cryptosystem ... [which] can be implemented in any field where the discrete logarithm problem is difficult.&quot;

== Largest known Cunningham chains ==

It follows from Dickson&#x27;s conjecture and the broader Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis H, both widely believed to be true, that for every &quot;k&quot; there are infinitely many Cunningham chains of length &quot;k&quot;. There are, however, no known direct methods of generating such chains.

There are computing competitions for the longest Cunningham chain or for the one built up of the largest primes, but unlike the breakthrough of Ben J. Green and Terence Tao – the Green–Tao theorem, that there are arithmetic progressions of primes of arbitrary length – there is no general result known on large Cunningham chains to date.

&quot;q&quot;# denotes the primorial 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × ... × &quot;q&quot;.

, the longest known Cunningham chain of either kind is of length 19, discovered by Jaroslaw Wroblewski in 2014.

== Congruences of Cunningham chains ==

Let the odd prime formula_8 be the first prime of a Cunningham chain of the first kind. The first prime is odd, thus formula_9. Since each successive prime in the chain is formula_10 it follows that formula_11. Thus, formula_12, formula_13, and so forth.

The above property can be informally observed by considering the primes of a chain in base 2. (Note that, as with all bases, multiplying by the base &quot;shifts&quot; the digits to the left; e.g. in decimal we have 314 × 10 = 3140.) When we consider  formula_10 in base 2, we see that, by multiplying  formula_15 by 2, the least significant digit of  formula_15 becomes the secondmost least significant digit of  formula_17. Because formula_15 is odd—that is, the least significant digit is 1 in base 2–we know that the secondmost least significant digit of  formula_17 is also 1. And, finally, we can see that  formula_17 will be odd due to the addition of 1 to formula_21. In this way, successive primes in a Cunningham chain are essentially shifted left in binary with ones filling in the least significant digits. For example, here is a complete length 6 chain which starts at 141361469:

A similar result holds for Cunningham chains of the second kind. From the observation that formula_9 and the relation formula_23 it follows that formula_24. In binary notation, the primes in a Cunningham chain of the second kind end with a pattern &quot;0...01&quot;, where, for each formula_25, the number of zeros in the pattern for formula_17 is one more than the number of zeros for formula_15. As with Cunningham chains of the first kind, the bits left of the pattern shift left by one position with each successive prime.

Similarly, because formula_28 it follows that formula_29. But, by Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, formula_30, so formula_8 divides formula_32 (i.e. with formula_33). Thus, no Cunningham chain can be of infinite length.

<text>The vomer (; ) is one of the unpaired facial bones of the skull. It is located in the midsagittal line, and articulates with the sphenoid, the ethmoid, the left and right palatine bones, and the left and right maxillary bones. The vomer forms the inferior part of the nasal septum in humans, with the superior part formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The name is derived from the Latin word for a ploughshare and the shape of the bone.

== In humans ==
The vomer is situated in the median plane, but its anterior portion is frequently bent to one side.

It is thin, somewhat quadrilateral in shape, and forms the hinder and lower part of the nasal septum; it has two surfaces and four borders.

The surfaces are marked by small furrows for blood vessels, and on each is the nasopalatine groove, which runs obliquely downward and forward, and lodges the nasopalatine nerve and vessels.

=== Borders ===
The &quot;superior border&quot;, the thickest, presents a deep furrow, bounded on either side by a horizontal projecting expansion of bone – called the wing of vomer; the furrow receives the rostrum of the sphenoid, while the margins of the alae articulate with the vaginal processes of the medial pterygoid plates of the sphenoid behind, and with the sphenoidal processes of the palatine bones in front.

The &quot;inferior border&quot; articulates with the crest formed by the maxillæ and palatine bones.

The &quot;anterior border&quot; is the longest and slopes downward and forward. Its upper half is fused with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid; its lower half is grooved for the inferior margin of the septal cartilage of the nose.

The &quot;posterior border&quot; is free of bony articulation, having no muscle attachments. It is concave, separates the choanae, and is thick and bifid above, thin below.

=== Articulations ===
The human vomer articulates with six bones:
* two of the cranium, the sphenoid and ethmoid.
* four of the face, two maxillae; and two palatine bones.

It also articulates with the septal cartilage of the nose.

== Vomeronasal organ ==
The vomeronasal organ, also called Jacobson&#x27;s organ, is a chemoreceptor organ named for its closeness to the vomer and nasal bones, and is particularly developed in animals such as cats (who adopt a characteristic pose called the &quot;Flehmen reaction&quot; or &quot;flehming&quot; when making use of it), and is thought to have to do with the perception of certain pheromones.

== In other animals ==
In bony fish, the vomers are flattened, paired, bones forming the anterior part of the roof of the mouth, just behind the premaxillary bones. In many species, they have teeth, supplementing those in the jaw proper; in some labyrinthodonts (extinct amphibians) the teeth on the vomers were actually larger than the primary set. In amphibians and reptiles, the vomers become narrower, due to the presence of the enlarged choanae (the inner part of the nostrils) on either side, and they may extend further back in the jaw. They are typically small in birds, where they form the upper hind part of the beak, again being located between the choanae.

In some living salamanders, including the mudpuppy, the maxilla is absent and therefore the vomerine teeth fulfill a major functional role in the upper jaw.

In mammals, the vomers have become narrower still, and are fused into a single, vertically oriented bone. The development of the hard palate beneath the vomer means that the bone is now located in a nasal chamber, separate from the mouth.

<text>Microsoft Paint (commonly known as MS Paint or simply Paint) is a simple raster graphics editor that has been included with all versions of Microsoft Windows. The program opens, modifies and saves image files in Windows bitmap (BMP), JPEG, GIF, PNG, and single-page TIFF formats. The program can be in color mode or two-color black-and-white, but there is no grayscale mode. For its simplicity and wide availability, it rapidly became one of the most used Windows applications, introducing many to painting on a computer for the first time.

In July 2017, Microsoft added Paint to the list of deprecated features of Windows 10 and announced that it had become a free standalone application in Microsoft Store, with Paint 3D as its replacement. However, as a result of public demand from users, Paint has continued to be included with Windows 10 and even Windows 11, with Microsoft instead deprecating Paint 3D. Windows 11 also includes an updated version of Paint in later versions that added, among others updates, a revamped UI and dark mode support.

== History ==
Paint was initially programmed, licensed and adapted from PC Paintbrush made by ZSoft, by Dan McCabe at Microsoft for Windows 1.0, released in late 1985. PC Paintbrush had been previously licensed and published with the Microsoft Mouse DOS drivers from version 4 (circa 1985), to compete with Mouse Systems publishing PCPaint with its own mice in 1984. PC Paintbrush’s inclusion in version 4 of the DOS drivers replaced the previously included Microsoft bitmap color editing application &quot;Doodle&quot;, released in 1983 with the first version of the Microsoft Mouse drivers. With improved functionality over Doodle, it competed successfully against PCPaint and Mouse Systems. Paint included with the first version of Windows, Windows 1.0 in November 1985, had 24 tools, supported only monochrome graphics, and could read and write files only in the proprietary &quot;MSP&quot; format. Aside from &quot;pencil&quot; and &quot;shape&quot; tools and a brush that draws in 24 &quot;brush shapes and patterns&quot;, the toolset also contained two features unique for the time: one the ability to draw Bézier curves and the other that forces lines to be drawn on three angles to create an isometric three-quarter perspective. Microsoft has since deprecated the MSP format, repurposing the MSP extension for the Windows Installer Package format.

Paint was later superseded by Paintbrush in Windows 3.0, with a redesigned user interface, true color support, and support for the BMP and PCX file formats. This version was also based on a newer licensed version of PC Paintbrush by ZSoft.

=== Windows 9x ===
Microsoft shipped an updated version of Paint with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. At this point Microsoft began updating the source code entirely from scratch, and did not license any further code or versions of PC Paintbrush. This version allows saving and loading custom color palettes as .pal files. This functionality only works correctly if the color depth of images is 16 bits per pixel (bpp) or higher. Later versions of Paint do not support this feature.

In Windows 95–98, Windows 2000 and Windows Me, Paint can open JPEG, GIF and 48-bit (16-bpp) TIF images and save images in JPEG and GIF formats when appropriate graphics filters are installed. Such plug-ins are included with Microsoft Office and Microsoft PhotoDraw. This also allows Paint to use transparent backgrounds. Support for PCX files was dropped. Starting with Windows Me, the canvas size expands automatically when larger images are opened or pasted instead of asking like in previous versions of Windows.

=== Windows XP and Vista ===
In Windows XP and later, Paint uses GDI+ and therefore can natively save images as BMP, JPEG, GIF, TIFF and PNG without requiring additional graphics filters. Support for saving and loading custom color palettes was dropped.

In Windows Vista, the toolbar icons were updated and the default color palette was changed. Paint in Windows Vista can undo a change up to 10 times, compared to 3 in previous versions; it also includes a slider for image magnification and a crop function. This version saves in JPEG format by default.

=== Windows 7 and 8.x ===

The version of Paint in Windows 7 and later features a ribbon in its user interface. It also features &quot;artistic&quot; brushes composed of varying shades of gray and some degree of transparency that give a more realistic result. To add to the realism, the oil and watercolor brushes can only paint for a small distance before the user must re-click (this gives the illusion that the paintbrush has run out of paint). In addition, Paint can now undo up to 50 subsequent changes. It also has anti-aliased shapes, which can be resized freely until they are rasterized when another tool is selected. This version supports viewing (but not saving) transparent PNG and ICO file formats and saves files in the .png file format by default.

Text can now be pasted into text boxes that don&#x27;t have enough room to display the text. A text box can then be enlarged or reshaped appropriately to fit the text if desired. Previous versions of Paint would display an error message if a user tried to paste more text than there was room for.

The Windows 8 version of Paint mostly corrects a long-standing defect from previous versions involving the inability to scroll the window when editing in Zoom view over 100%. However, when the user inserts text in Zoom view, they cannot move the text beyond the zoomed viewport while the text window is in edit mode with either the mouse or keyboard.

=== Windows 10 ===
In the April 2017 &quot;Creators Update&quot; for Windows 10, Microsoft released Paint 3D alongside Paint. In addition to the traditional two-dimensional drawing tools, Paint 3D can import and manipulate three-dimensional models. Three months later, on July 23, 2017, Microsoft added Paint to the list of deprecated Windows features. The next day, in the wake of &quot;an incredible outpouring of support and nostalgia&quot;, Microsoft clarified that Paint would become a free app on Microsoft Store, even though Paint 3D offers the same functionality.

Despite the deprecation, Paint continues to be a part of all versions of Windows 10 up to version 22H2. The closest that Microsoft ever got to enacting said decision was adding a removal notice to Paint&#x27;s user interface in Windows 10 versions 1803 and 1809.

In March 2021, with the release of Windows 10 Insider build 21332 to the Dev Channel, Microsoft removed Paint 3D from clean installations of the build, in addition to the 3D Objects app. In April 2021, Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider build 21354, which made Paint (along with Snipping Tool) updatable from the Microsoft Store. It had also been moved from the Windows Accessories folder of the Start menu to its own section.

=== Windows 11 ===
In August 2021, Microsoft teased an updated version of Paint for Windows 11, featuring a refreshed user interface (UI), improved font picker, and a dark theme. This newly updated version of Paint was released with Windows 11 Insider build 22468 in September 2021, and was officially released as part of the Windows 11 2022 Update in September 2022. In September 2023, Microsoft released an update that added layers, support for transparent PNG files, AI art generator and other AI tools and a background removal tool.

Despite new features being added into Paint in Windows 11, some older features have disappeared. Paint in Windows 11 also automatically anti-aliases all fonts that are inputted using the &quot;Text&quot; feature. Smaller images are also harder to manipulate and work with in newer versions of Paint, as it automatically blurs images when they are resized or re-copied. This is especially noticeable when working with video game sprites and pixel art. These issues are due to interpolation algorithms that Paint is using, according to Microsoft.

== Features ==
Paint has a few functions not mentioned in the help file: a &quot;stamp mode&quot;, &quot;trail mode&quot;, &quot;regular shapes&quot;, and moving pictures. For the stamp mode, the user can select a part of the image, hold the key, and move it to another part of the canvas. This, instead of cutting the piece out, creates a copy of it. The process can be repeated as many times as desired, as long as the key is held down. The trail mode works exactly the same, but it uses the instead of the key.

It is also possible to thicken or thin a line either before or simultaneously while it is being drawn via (NumPad only) or (NumPad only).

To crop whitespace or eliminate parts of a graphic, the blue handle in the lower right corner can be dragged to increase canvas size or crop a graphic. Users can also draw perfect shapes (which have a width equal to the height) using any shape tool by holding down the while dragging.

Older versions of Paint, such as the one bundled with Windows 3.1, featured a color-replace brush, which replaced a single color underneath the brush with another without affecting the rest of the image. In later versions of Paint, the color erase brush was removed as an option, however it can still be simulated by selecting the color to be replaced as the primary color, and the one it is replaced with as the secondary color, and then right-click dragging the erase tool.

=== Support for indexed palettes ===
By default, almost all versions of Paint are generally unable to properly downgrade created images to indexed palettes using fewer than 24 bits per pixel. When saving an image in a format that uses indexed palettes with fewer than 24 bits per pixel, a warning message appears about the loss of quality. Paint does not utilize binary, color or grayscale dithering or palette optimization, and the image will be saved with usually irreversibly scrambled colors.

Paint is nonetheless able to correctly load and save indexed palettes in any of the supported formats if an image is opened as an 8-bit or otherwise indexed palette image. In that case, the image&#x27;s palette is preserved when saving. However, there is no way to see the actual palette; color choices for brushes, text, and erasers as well as user-defined colors will be limited to the closest available color in the indexed palette.

<text>In mathematics, a multiply perfect number (also called multiperfect number or pluperfect number) is a generalization of a perfect number.

For a given natural number &quot;k&quot;, a number &quot;n&quot; is called (or perfect) if the sum of all positive divisors of &quot;n&quot; (the divisor function, &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is equal to &quot;kn&quot;; a number is thus perfect if and only if it is . A number that is for a certain &quot;k&quot; is called a multiply perfect number. As of 2014, numbers are known for each value of &quot;k&quot; up to 11.

It is unknown whether there are any odd multiply perfect numbers other than 1. The first few multiply perfect numbers are:
:1, 6, 28, 120, 496, 672, 8128, 30240, 32760, 523776, 2178540, 23569920, 33550336, 45532800, 142990848, 459818240, ... .

== Example ==
The sum of the divisors of 120 is
:1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 + 120 = 360
which is 3 × 120. Therefore 120 is a number.

== Smallest known &quot;k&quot;-perfect numbers ==

The following table gives an overview of the smallest known numbers for &quot;k&quot; ≤ 11 :

== Properties ==

It can be proven that:

* For a given prime number &quot;p&quot;, if &quot;n&quot; is and &quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;pn&quot; is . This implies that an integer &quot;n&quot; is a number divisible by 2 but not by 4, if and only if &quot;n&quot;/2 is an odd perfect number, of which none are known.
* If 3&quot;n&quot; is and 3 does not divide &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is .

== Odd multiply perfect numbers ==

It is unknown whether there are any odd multiply perfect numbers other than 1. However if an odd number &quot;n&quot; exists where &quot;k&quot; &gt; 2, then it must satisfy the following conditions:
* The largest prime factor is ≥ 100129
* The second largest prime factor is ≥ 1009
* The third largest prime factor is ≥ 101

== Bounds ==

In little-o notation, the number of multiply perfect numbers less than &quot;x&quot; is formula_1 for all ε &gt; 0.

The number of &quot;k&quot;-perfect numbers &quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; is less than formula_2, where &quot;c&quot; and &quot;c&quot;&#x27; are constants independent of &quot;k&quot;.

Under the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis, the following inequality is true for all numbers &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; &gt; 3
:formula_3
where formula_4 is Euler&#x27;s gamma constant. This can be proven using Robin&#x27;s theorem.

The number of divisors τ(&quot;n&quot;) of a number &quot;n&quot; satisfies the inequality
:formula_5

The number of distinct prime factors ω(&quot;n&quot;) of &quot;n&quot; satisfies
:formula_6

If the distinct prime factors of &quot;n&quot; are formula_7, then:
:formula_8
:formula_9

==Specific values of &quot;k&quot;==
===Perfect numbers===

A number &quot;n&quot; with σ(&quot;n&quot;) = 2&quot;n&quot; is perfect.

===Triperfect numbers===
A number &quot;n&quot; with σ(&quot;n&quot;) = 3&quot;n&quot; is triperfect. There are only six known triperfect numbers and these are believed to comprise all such numbers:

: 120, 672, 523776, 459818240, 1476304896, 51001180160 

If there exists an odd perfect number &quot;m&quot; (a famous open problem) then 2&quot;m&quot; would be , since σ(2&quot;m&quot;) = σ(2)&amp;hairsp;σ(&quot;m&quot;) = 3×2&quot;m&quot;. An odd triperfect number must be a square number exceeding 1070 and have at least 12 distinct prime factors, the largest exceeding 105.

==Variations==
===Unitary multiply perfect numbers===
A similar extension can be made for unitary perfect numbers. A positive integer &quot;n&quot; is called a unitary multi number if σ*(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;kn&quot; where σ*(&quot;n&quot;) is the sum of its unitary divisors. (A divisor &quot;d&quot; of a number &quot;n&quot; is a unitary divisor if &quot;d&quot; and &quot;n/d&quot; share no common factors.). 

A unitary multiply perfect number is simply a unitary multi number for some positive integer &quot;k&quot;. Equivalently, unitary multiply perfect numbers are those &quot;n&quot; for which &quot;n&quot; divides σ*(&quot;n&quot;). A unitary multi number is naturally called a unitary perfect number. In the case &quot;k&quot; &gt; 2, no example of a unitary multi number is yet known. It is known that if such a number exists, it must be even and greater than 10102 and must have more than forty four odd prime factors. This problem is probably very difficult to settle. The concept of unitary divisor was originally due to R. Vaidyanathaswamy (1931) who called such a divisor as block factor. The present terminology is due to E. Cohen (1960).

The first few unitary multiply perfect numbers are:
:1, 6, 60, 90, 87360 

===Bi-unitary multiply perfect numbers===

A positive integer &quot;n&quot; is called a bi-unitary multi number if σ**(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;kn&quot; where σ**(&quot;n&quot;) is the sum of its bi-unitary divisors. This concept is due to Peter Hagis (1987). A bi-unitary multiply perfect number is simply a bi-unitary multi number for some positive integer &quot;k&quot;. Equivalently, bi-unitary multiply perfect numbers are those &quot;n&quot; for which &quot;n&quot; divides σ**(&quot;n&quot;). A bi-unitary multi number is naturally called a bi-unitary perfect number, and a bi-unitary multi number is called a bi-unitary triperfect number.

A divisor &quot;d&quot; of a positive integer &quot;n&quot; is called a bi-unitary divisor of &quot;n&quot; if the greatest common unitary divisor (gcud) of &quot;d&quot; and &quot;n&quot;/&quot;d&quot; equals 1. This concept is due to D. Surynarayana (1972). The sum of the (positive) bi-unitary divisors of &quot;n&quot; is denoted by σ**(&quot;n&quot;). 

Peter Hagis (1987) proved that there are no odd bi-unitary multiperfect numbers other than 1. Haukkanen and Sitaramaiah (2020) found all bi-unitary triperfect numbers of the form 2&quot;a&quot;&quot;u&quot; where 1 ≤ &quot;a&quot; ≤ 6 and &quot;u&quot; is odd, and partially the case where &quot;a&quot; = 7.

Further, they fixed completely the case &quot;a&quot; = 8.

The first few bi-unitary multiply perfect numbers are:
:1, 6, 60, 90, 120, 672, 2160, 10080, 22848, 30240

<text>John Wakeham, Baron Wakeham, (born 22 June 1932) is a British businessman and Conservative Party politician. He was chancellor of Brunel University between 1998 and 2012, and since then has been its chancellor emeritus.

Wakeham was a director of Enron from 1994 until its bankruptcy in 2001.

==Early life and education==

Wakeham was educated at two independent schools in Surrey: Aldro School in Shackleford, and Charterhouse near Godalming. He became a successful accountant and later a businessman.

==Political career==
Wakeham stood unsuccessfully in Coventry East in 1966 and in Putney in 1970 before his election to the House of Commons at the February 1974 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Maldon in Essex. He became a minister following Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s victory in 1979.

During the late 1980s he served as Leader of the House of Commons, in which capacity he was responsible for the televising of Parliament, and as Energy Secretary (1989–92), where he drew up plans for the privatisation of electricity supply. Following a recommendation by John Major, he was created a life peer on 29 April 1992 taking the title Baron Wakeham, of Maldon in the County of Essex, serving as the Leader of the House of Lords until 1994.

Wakeham became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission in 1995, retiring in 2001. In 1997 he was appointed a Deputy lieutenant of Hampshire. Tony Blair appointed him in 1999 to head a Royal commission on reform of the House of Lords – the resulting Wakeham Report suggested a mainly-appointed Lords be maintained, with a small elected component.

==Personal life==
His first wife, Roberta, was killed in the Brighton hotel bombing in October 1984 and he was trapped in rubble for seven hours, suffering serious crush injuries to his legs. The couple had two children. Wakeham married his secretary, Alison Ward MBE, in 1985 and they have a son of their own. Before being Wakeham&#x27;s secretary, Ward had been Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s secretary.

<text>His Grace, The Duke of Ankh, Commander Sir Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; Vimes is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series. Vimes is depicted in the novels as somewhere between an Inspector Morse-type &#x27;old-school&#x27; British policeman, and a film noir-esque grizzled detective. His appearances throughout the Discworld sequence show him slowly and grudgingly rising through the ranks of both police force and society. As of his latest promotion, his full name and title is stated as being &quot;&quot;His Grace, His Excellency, The 1st Duke of Ankh; Commander Sir Samuel Vimes&quot;. When serving as Ambassador for Ankh-Morpork, he is also referred to simply as &quot;His Excellency&quot;, and is also nicknamed &quot;Blackboard Monitor Vimes&quot;&quot;, &quot;Vimes the Butcher&quot; and &quot;Vetinari&#x27;s Terrier&quot; (or his &quot;hammer&quot;, depending upon the occasion). According to his wife, Sybil, Vimes is recognised by many as Lord Vetinari&#x27;s right-hand man.

He first appeared in the novel &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;. While no detailed description of his physical appearance shows up in any of the Discworld novels, Pratchett says in the companion work, &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot;, that he has always imagined Vimes as a younger, slightly bulkier version of late British actor Pete Postlethwaite. Longtime collaborative artist Paul Kidby, who has worked with Pratchett on several works, portrays him instead as resembling Clint Eastwood.

Vimes is the Commander of the City Watch, the burgeoning police force of the Discworld&#x27;s largest city, Ankh-Morpork. His rise from drunk policeman to respected member of the aristocracy, and the simultaneous growth and development of the Watch under his command, have together been one of the major threads of the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. Born into poverty, (as a descendant of disgraced ancient Ankh-Morpork nobility), he became a highly reluctant member of modern Ankh-Morpork nobility, having been made both a knight and a duke, as well as an ambassador. He is married to Sybil Ramkin, the richest woman in the city. They have a son, &quot;The Honourable Samuel Vimes II&quot;.

==Works==
Beginning with &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; in 1989, the main Discworld books featuring Sam Vimes are:
*&quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; – 1989
*&quot;Men at Arms&quot; – 1993
*&quot;Feet of Clay&quot; – 1996
*&quot;Jingo&quot; – 1997
*&quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; – 1999
*&quot;The Truth&quot; – 2000 (minor character)
*&quot;Night Watch&quot; – 2002
*&quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; – 2003 (minor character)
*&quot;Thud!&quot; – 2005
*&quot;Where&#x27;s My Cow?&quot; – 2005
*&quot;Making Money&quot; – 2007 (minor character)
*&quot;Unseen Academicals&quot; – 2009 (minor character)
*&quot;Snuff&quot; – 2011
*&quot;Raising Steam&quot; – 2013 (supporting character)

==Background==
Sam Vimes was born in Cockbill Street as the son of Thomas Vimes, (son of Gwilliam Vimes) in the poorest area of Ankh-Morpork, so poor that there was little crime, though Sam was part of a street gang (&quot;The Cockbill Street Roaring Lads&quot;) with Lupine Wonse, who later became secretary to Lord Vetinari.

Vimes was educated at a dame school, where he was once blackboard monitor for a whole term, before he had to drop out and concentrate on learning about life out on the streets. It is mentioned in &quot;Jingo&quot; that Sam Vimes&#x27; father, Thomas Vimes, had been a watchman prior to his death. His mother would go on to tell young Sam that his father was &#x27;run down by a cart when he was crossing the street&#x27;. He privately thinks later that his father was a drunk: &quot;Vimes had never known his father. His mum told him that the man had been run over by a cart, but Vimes suspected that if this were true at all, then it was probably a brewer&#x27;s cart, which had &#x27;run him over&#x27; a bit at a time for years&quot;. She raised young Sam on her own and died about twenty years after the events of &quot;Night Watch&quot; and is buried in the city&#x27;s Small Gods Cemetery. In &quot;Night Watch&quot; Sam remembers that his mother made &#x27;the very best&#x27; Distressed Pudding.

The Vimes family is mentioned as historically being closely linked with the City Watch, with many members serving in it through its history. It has been suggested that Sam is a descendant of Suffer-Not-Injustice &quot;Old Stoneface&quot; Vimes, the Watch Commander who instigated the rebellion against, and subsequently beheaded, Lorenzo the Kind, the last king of the city, a sadistic torturer described as &quot;very fond of children.&quot; As a consequence, the Vimes family was stripped of its nobility. For three centuries afterwards, the memory of &quot;Old Stoneface&quot; has lived on in infamy and Vimes has frequently endured suspicious mutterings from the aristocracy. Vimes is implied to heavily resemble his ancestor and they share a nickname: &quot;Old Stoneface&quot;. &quot;The Annotated Pratchett File&quot; notes that Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes is closely modelled on Oliver Cromwell, and that the name of his supporters, the Ironheads, is a portmanteau of Ironsides and Roundheads, Cromwell&#x27;s regiment and faction, respectively.

Vimes was sixteen when he joined the Watch. He was part of that section of the Watch which played a large role in the rebellion against Homicidal Lord Winder. Around this time, he was taught all he knew by Sergeant-At-Arms John Keel, which is where his cynical outlook on life and his firm belief in justice comes from.
In the newest stories, Keel is Vimes himself transported back in time by thirty years. As Lu-Tze explains to Vimes in &quot;Night Watch&quot;, both pasts are true. Vimes was transported back in time in the company of a criminal named Carcer, whom he was trying to apprehend. Carcer robbed and killed the real John Keel, and Vimes had to replace him in order for his role in history to be fulfilled.

Vimes&#x27; age is never explicitly given, and is not always consistent. &quot;Night Watch&quot; states that Vimes was sixteen years old when he joined the City Watch. &quot;Men at Arms&quot; mentions that Vimes had been in the Watch for 25 years, making him 41 at the time of that novel. The main events of &quot;Night Watch&quot;, set only a few weeks after Vimes joined the Watch, are stated as occurring more than thirty years prior to the present from which Vimes came, this makes Samuel Vimes at least 46 years old at the time of that book. &quot;Thud!&quot; gives the age of Vimes&#x27; son, (also named Sam), born during the climax of &quot;Night Watch&quot;, as being fourteen months, which would put Vimes at a minimum of 47 or 48 years old during the events of the book. When Vimes discusses his time as a blackboard monitor, he thinks about it being &quot;more than 45 years ago&quot; and that he was six years old at the time, putting his age at least 51 years; this is confirmed when he refers to the new vampire officer, age given as 51, as being &quot;not that much younger than him&quot;. It is also mentioned in &quot;Night Watch&quot;, that at the time of the &quot;Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May&quot;, both Sam Vimes and Havelock Vetinari were 16 years old, meaning that they are both the same age.

==The Watch==
During the first 25 years of his term in the Watch, Vimes rose to Captain of the Night Watch, a position that he attained about ten years prior to the events of &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;, as it dwindled to a tiny stub – while the power of the Thieves&#x27; Guild grew. This insult to Vimes&#x27; sense of justice, together with his being naturally knurd (the opposite of being drunk, where one is stripped of all the illusions that make life bearable) and other events (it has been claimed he was &quot;brung low by a woman&quot;, which is an interpretation of the anthropomorphisation of the city, Morporkia), led towards heavy drinking. At this time, he lived in near poverty, giving away almost all of his salary to widows and orphans of watchmen, and spending what was left on alcohol and cheap boots.

All that changed when Carrot Ironfoundersson came to the city. A human raised by dwarfs, Carrot joined the Watch and set out to help the city. Around the same time, a dragon assaulted the city, and the Watch was instrumental in its defeat. The whole series of events forced Vimes to sober-up long enough to uncover who was responsible for summoning the Dragon, after which the changes in his personal life led to him coming off of the drink and switching to smoking cigars, and occasionally, taking snuff.

Vimes, who was about to retire following his marriage to Lady Sybil, was given the resurrected rank of Commander, putting him in charge of the Night Watch and the Day Watch. He also received a knighthood.

The Watch was given a new headquarters, Pseudopolis Yard (an allusion to the name of the headquarters of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police: Scotland Yard), by Lady Sybil Ramkin (Vimes&#x27;s soon-to-be wife) after the dragon destroyed their original base at Treacle Mine Road. It had been her childhood home, and in &quot;Thud!&quot; it is revealed that some of her family&#x27;s possessions are still stored in the attic of the building – in this instance they retrieved a copy of Methodia Rascal&#x27;s Koom Valley painting, made by Sybil as a child, after the original is stolen.

As part of an equal-opportunities drive required by the Patrician, the Watch under Vimes eventually took on extra staff in the form of a werewolf, a dwarf and a troll (and later a gargoyle, a gnome, a golem, an Igor, a zombie, and a vampire). They were instrumental in foiling an attempt on the Patrician&#x27;s life, and were rewarded. The Watch was rapidly revived and became increasingly important in the city.

Vimes took a great interest in the restructuring of the Watch, placing new Watch Houses where they were needed and supervising the creation of both a Watch Academy and a forensics section. His reform of the City Watch has been so successful that by &quot;Night Watch&quot;, Vimes-trained policemen are in high demand in cities across the Disc. They are known as &quot;Sammies&quot; (which is based on the British terms for police officers, &quot;Bobbies,&quot; and the now obsolete &quot;Peelers&quot; both after Robert Peel and possibly on the earlier term &quot;Charleys&quot; for night watchmen, after Charles II during whose reign they were instituted), even to the people who may have never actually heard of Samuel Vimes himself. In his expanding international and diplomatic role, Vimes appreciates the fact that police officers from Sto Lat to Genua have been trained to salute him, and remain in unofficial contact across the Disc.

==Character==
Vimes is a very conflicted character. An incorruptible idealist with deep beliefs in justice and an abiding love of his city, he is also a committed cynic whose knowledge of human nature constantly reminds him how far off those ideals are. Having married into the upper classes, he still possesses an innate dislike of inherited wealth and an instinctive revulsion towards social inequality. The Patrician observes that Vimes is anti-authoritarian even though he is, himself, an authority figure, which is &quot;practically Zen&quot;. The conflict within Vimes is between his virtuous nature (&quot;the Watchman&quot;) and what he calls &quot;the Beast&quot;. In &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot;, Pratchett explains that Vimes protects himself from the Beast with the symbol of his own badge, which prevents him from becoming the criminal he despises, at least in his own mind. Although in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; Vimes is all but shocked at Vetinari&#x27;s disturbingly cynical (and probably disturbingly accurate) view of the world, he in turn has been called &quot;the most cynical bastard that ever walked under the sun&quot; (in &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;). Although widely differing characters, Vimes and Vetinari can be called similar in that they both have very cynical worldviews, but fairly idealistic aims. 

Vimes has once been described as a speciesist, though this habit slowly dies away; most of his officers rationalize this bias as simply not being particularly fond of &quot;anyone&quot;. However, he will warm up to anyone he considers a &quot;good copper&quot; regardless of their unusual background and has allowed the Watch to become one of the most species-blind employers in the city. Initially, Vimes is jokingly described as only fond of rural dwarfs and wizards, the former who only commit crimes underground and away from him and the latter ironically sharing his respectful distaste for using magic irresponsibly. A notable exception is his explicit dislike of vampires. He explained to the abstaining vampire Lady Margolotta in &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, this is because, teetotal or not, &#x27;a vampire will always seek to dominate a human being&#x27;.

Despite being viewed by many of the Discworld&#x27;s more Machiavellian power brokers as easy to fool, Vimes is more cunning than he appears. His years of practical experience give him a foundation of hard-headed realism on which he bases much of his more idealistic beliefs. A running gag in the series is his thwarting of several attempts on his life by the Assassins&#x27; Guild, due to his knowledge of their rigid code of conduct. Thanks to the funds now available to him through marriage, his mansion is set with numerous traps so that the Assassins, who must always offer a sporting chance, cannot get close to him without suffering a severe mishap. Traps include roof tiles set on greased rails, sawn roof joists over the dragon pens and bear traps in the shrubbery. Vimes also personally makes sure that all of the brickwork is kept in good repair, with no convenient handholds. In addition, Vimes&#x27; office at Pseudopolis Yard has &quot;everything that his ingenuity could devise&quot;, including sharp ornamental railings, &quot;which are pretty, and make the house look nice, but are, above all, spiky.&quot;

Whenever he thwarts an Assassin in an attempt, he usually lets them go after taking their share of the payment for his inhumation (which he then donates to the &#x27;Watch Widows and Orphans Fund&#x27;, or to the &#x27;Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick, Abused or Abandoned Dragons&#x27;), and subjecting them to a little humiliation. Though he finds it to be annoying, Vimes takes these continued attempts on his life as a sign that he&#x27;s angering somebody, and so must be doing something right. In every book in the series, the fee for his assassination has risen until he has been removed from the Guild register, meaning that contracts on his life are no longer accepted (this was initially literal, as no assassin wanted to take the contract). Vimes was made aware of this by a young female student from the guild, who had been tasked with merely getting a glimpse of Vimes at his home (after she had fallen into one of the &quot;eventually lethal&quot; traps). Vimes is considering appealing the decision. In &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, Vimes managed to evade, fight off, and &#x27;kill&#x27; part of a pack of werewolves in &quot;the game&quot;, a werewolf tradition of chasing a human back to civilization that humans did not often win. (Angua&#x27;s brother Wolfgang denies that the werewolves died, as they can only truly be killed by silver; they would just have &quot;nasty headaches later on.&quot;) Vimes also reflects on killing a werewolf in &quot;Night Watch&quot; and Vetinari mentions him killing a werewolf in &quot;Thud!&quot;. He eventually did actually kill Wolfgang (with a firework, it having been previously established that werewolves can be killed by fire as well as silver.)

While not otherwise well-traveled, in the days of &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; he could tell exactly where he was anywhere within the city limits of Ankh-Morpork just by the feel of the cobbles beneath his feet, due to the thinness of his boots at the time, having walked the streets of the city for thirty years and a knowledge of the difference of the cobbles therein. When he is returned to the past in &quot;Night Watch&quot;, he uses this ability to locate a group of monks he needs in order to return to his present. Later in the series, the expensive, good quality boots his wife persists in buying for him restrict this ability.

Vimes&#x27; firm grasp of basic human nature, and of the Ankh-Morpork psyche in particular, led to him spending some years as a drunk, and Fred Colon postulates that this was because Vimes&#x27; body didn&#x27;t produce any &quot;natural alcohol&quot;, and he estimates that Vimes was about &quot;two drinks below par&quot;. This meant that when he hadn&#x27;t been drinking, he was beyond sober - he was &quot;knurd&quot;. Thus, he saw reality as it really was (&quot;first sight&quot;); stripped of all the mental illusions that most people construct in their minds to get to sleep at night (&quot;second sight&quot;). This horrifying state of mind caused Vimes to try to balance it out through drinking, but he would get the dosage wrong and would just end up drunk. Vimes gave up alcohol after his marriage to Sybil, and now smokes foul-smelling cigars instead. He still keeps an unopened bottle of &#x27;Bearhugger&#x27;s Whisky&#x27; in his bottom desk drawer as a &#x27;permanent test&#x27;.

Terry Pratchett noted the following about Vimes on Usenet: &quot;Vimes is fundamentally a person. He fears he may be a bad person because he knows what he thinks rather than just what he says and does. He chokes off all of those little reactions and impulses, but he knows what they are. So he tries to act like a good person, often in situations where the map is unclear.&quot;REVIEW: &quot;Going Postal&quot; by Terry Pratchett (no spoilers) This, along with the Discworld habit of pushing any theory as hard as it goes, appears to have culminated in Vimes&#x27; psyche creating its own &#x27;internal policeman&#x27; to &quot;Guard the Guardsmen&quot;, (cf. &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot;), and Vimes&#x27; own sense of justice being so strong that, in Thud!, it was even able to fend off the attempts to possess him by a &#x27;quasi-demonic &quot;thing&quot; of pure vengeance&#x27;.

It has also been noted that in personality and mental setup, Vimes bears some similarity to Granny Weatherwax.Both are effectively &#x27;good&#x27; characters, who nevertheless both secretly fear the darkness inside themselves, and constantly strive to control the darker sides of their nature.

Vimes often has to go to report to Lord Vetinari, although most of the time he keeps a poker-face and answers very simply to avoid Vetinari&#x27;s probing questions. When given bad news, he has a tendency to, on his way out, pound his fist against a certain spot of wall near the office door. Though he sometimes has to call in a plasterer when Vimes is particularly angry, Vetinari doesn&#x27;t worry about it—a sign that he intentionally angers Vimes so as to goad him into a desired action. When Vimes was temporarily relieved of command in &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, the fact that Vimes &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; pound the wall led Vetinari to realize that he &#x27;may have gone too far&#x27;.

Sometimes this darker side comes out when Vimes loses control of his anger and he effectively &#x27;goes spare&#x27;. In &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, he temporarily gains possession of the Gonne, a malevolent firearm which drives him to violence, but he restrains the urge to &quot;make things right&quot;, enough to eventually let it go without seriously hurting anyone. In &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;, Corporal Nobby Nobbs refuses the position of King of Ankh-Morpork, primarily due to the fear of incurring Vimes&#x27;s general wrath and hatred of royalty.

In &quot;Thud!&quot;, after an attempted assassination of his family, Vimes becomes furious at the &#x27;deep-down dwarves&#x27; responsible for the attack on his family - a problem only made worse by the presence of a dark entity of pure vengeance within his mind. Both of those factors, and a near-Death experience that forced him to miss his 6:00pm story-time with his son, culminate in Vimes snapping, temporarily losing control to &quot;the Beast&quot;, and single-handedly storming the deep-downers responsible, all the while roaring out the lines to &quot;Where&#x27;s My Cow?&quot;; (&quot;...IS THAT MY COW? IT GOES, &#x27;MOOOOO!&#x27;...&quot;) with such ferocity that their personal guard come to the conclusion that &quot;they had sworn to fight to the death, but not to &quot;this&quot; death,&quot; and run away. As he is about to massacre the now-defenceless deep-downers, Vimes hesitates thanks to &quot;the Watchman&quot; in his head and begins to struggle with himself, which buys enough time for Sergeant Angua to arrive at the scene and force him down. Even under the worst provocation Vimes is shown to never completely loses control, always managing to restrain himself (or have someone around to restrain him) in the end.

Revealed in the events of &quot;Thud!&quot;, after years of night-time patrols, Vimes&#x27; mindscape is described as the city of Ankh-Morpork-itself, streets and all, in the dead of night, whilst the rains are bucketing down over your head. Whenever Vimes is angry, doors of some of the houses open (the angrier he is, the more numbers of doors will open). While the &quot;Summoning Dark&quot; had trespassed into his mind, needing a host in order to track down the Deep-Downer Dwarves, would try to enter through one of the doors that opened when Vimes became angry, only to be pulled away at every time. It is later revealed that the force that was preventing the &quot;Summoning Dark&quot; from making any progress in possessing Vimes was Vimes&#x27; own &#x27;inner guardsman&#x27;, who patrols the streets of his mind.

Vimes is an effective and brutal hand-to-hand fighter, who specialises in &quot;dirty fighting&quot;. He also prefers non-lethal takedowns whenever possible.

During heightened states of mind, such as when confronting his darker side and/or when near death, he is able to see Death, (this happened in &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; and &quot;Thud!&quot;, although he was unable to do this in &quot;Night Watch&quot;). Death himself is unsure whether Vimes should die or not in these cases, citing &quot;quantum&quot; as an explanation. At one point Death notes that if Vimes is having a &#x27;near-Death&#x27; experience, Death is also forced to have a &#x27;near Vimes&#x27; experience (as of &quot;Thud!&quot; Death has started bringing books to read during these occasions).

On rare occasions, Sam Vimes has been described as completely happy, even if it&#x27;s only for a brief period; such occasions include alone time with his wife, the birth of his son, and whenever a case has reached a satisfactory conclusion. At the end of the events of &quot;Snuff&quot;, Vimes was also genuinely amazed to learn that a new book, &quot;&quot;Pride and Extreme Prejudice&quot;, had been dedicated to him.

==Lady Sybil==
Lady Sybil Vimes (full title: Her Grace, The Duchess of Ankh, Lady Sybil Deidre Olgivanna Vimes (née Ramkin)), is Vimes&#x27;s wife, whom he married at the end of &quot;Men at Arms&quot;. First introduced in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;, she is a rather imposing Wagnerian aristocrat, but also a kind-hearted and compassionate person, embodying the positive aspects of aristocrats, who are otherwise depicted unflatteringly in Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s population. She is a deeply gracious lady, able to like almost anyone (even &quot;Nobby Nobbs&quot;). She donated a property, Pseudopolis Yard, (bought by her father), to the Watch after their original headquarters was burnt by a dragon.

She was born into the wealthiest family in Ankh-Morpork and resides in the most select part of Ankh, Scoone Avenue. As well as being an amateur soprano, she is a leading expert in swamp dragons and has a dragon pen outside her house where she breeds and cares for swamp dragons, though aside from her hobby most of her house is vaguely under-tended due to apparent lack of interest. She also supports &quot;The Sunshine Sanctuary For Sick, Abused Or Abandoned Swamp Dragons&quot;, which is run by her friend Rosie Devant-Molei. Her hobby has left her with her natural hair singed off and she wears a wig in nearly all circumstances. Despite her high-class upbringing, she has displayed a resourcefulness (&quot;in an outdoorsy kind of way&quot;) that first attracted Vimes&#x27;s attention. 
The pattern of Sam and Sybil&#x27;s marriage was set the moment he turned away from his wedding to chase an assassin who had just made an attempt on the Patrician&#x27;s life. Lady Sybil is a remarkably patient woman; she spent nearly the entirety of &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; attempting to inform her increasingly distracted husband that she was pregnant with their first child. Though he finds being affectionate in public embarrassing and is divided on disliking Sybil&#x27;s status as a noble, it is clear that Vimes loves his wife dearly; indeed when he was trapped in the past alone in a world he no longer recognised, the History Monks gave him a silver cigar case his wife had bought him to inspire him to continue with his mission. It is unclear if his hatred of crime and the evil of humanity is greater than his love for his wife. Sybil bears this divided loyalty with some grace; nearly every Watch novel concludes with Sam making some form of amends to his neglected wife, either a delayed honeymoon, or simply time alone with their new baby.

In spite (or perhaps &quot;because&quot;) of her wealth, Sybil engages in certain &#x27;housewife&#x27;-like activities such as repairing socks and preparing meals. This is mainly out of a sense of duty and tradition than actual need or skill. Sam is somewhat baffled by the overtures, but as he is already used to an imperfect lifestyle, he is generally appreciative of the sentiment.

Sybil maintains a number of close (female) social contacts from her schooldays, who, thanks to the kind of school she went to (The Quirm College for Young Ladies), are now all strategically placed in the highest levels of power across the Sto Plains and often more powerful than Ankh-Morpork Guild leaders. Vimes once conjectured that if they so conspired, they could run the world, if they don&#x27;t already do so.

Sybil tries her utmost to get Sam to take some time off in almost every book, but for the most part, Sam finds an excuse to stay on the job. In &quot;Snuff&quot;, Sybil forces Vimes to take a vacation to their countryside estate, Crundells. The character of one of her ancestors, John &quot;Mad Jack&quot;&quot; Ramkin, was inspired from real-life aristocrat John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Fuller of Sussex (&amp;/or John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Mytton of Shropshire). As the aforementioned John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Ramkin is also hailed as the 3rd Earl Ramkin, this reveals that the Ramkin estate is an earldom, and that Lady Sybil was already a countess (provided that the title wasn&#x27;t entailed) before her husband, Sam Vimes&#x27;, elevation to Duke at the end of &quot;Jingo&quot;.

==Vimes as Duke of Ankh==
Vimes&#x27; involvement in preventing a pointless war with Klatch in the novel &quot;Jingo&quot; led to his being once more rewarded with an unwanted title, in this case, Duke of Ankh. He now finds himself in the awkward position (&quot;practically zen&quot; according to his boss) of continuing to despise the ruling classes of the city while actually being a member of them. In the course of his mission to Überwald as ambassador, he was disgusted to learn that he was also entitled to be addressed as &quot;His Excellency&quot;, although he learns to wield it for practical clout, especially when pursuing investigations where his status as an officer is unknown or ignored.

His role as Duke of Ankh largely involves diplomacy (his visit to Überwald in &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; for example), and his rough and ready upbringing has given him an obliquely effective approach to this field. For instance, he once threatened to personally send an opposing diplomat &quot;&quot;home in an ambulance&quot; for parading his troops near Ankh-Morpork borders, an act that caused the man to order an &quot;immediate&quot; withdrawal so drastic that Havelock Vetinari remarked &quot;they were nearly in the next country over.&quot; Despite having competent subordinates, including Captains Carrot and Angua and Sergeant Detritus, Vimes finds it difficult to delegate, and is frustrated by the fact that the growth of the Watch has left him with less and less time for actual boots-on-the-pavement policing. In some ways he found it a relief when, in &quot;Night Watch&quot;, he was transported back to the Ankh-Morpork of his youth, and became a sergeant-at-arms in the inefficient, paperwork-free albeit moderately corrupt Watch of that time.

==Young Sam==
Young Sam (full title: The Hon. Samuel &quot;Young Sam&quot;&quot; Vimes II) is Sam and Sybil Vimes&#x27; son and only child; he was born at the end of the events in &quot;Night Watch&quot;, is about fourteen months old by the time of &quot;Thud!&quot;, and at the age of six years by the time of the events of &quot;Snuff&quot;. His birth was difficult, and Vimes paid Doctor &quot;Mossy&quot; Lawn a large sum of money in gratitude for saving Sybil&#x27;s and the baby&#x27;s lives. Lawn has since founded the Lady Sybil Free Hospital.

Since his son&#x27;s birth, Vimes discovered a new cause in life: &quot;arriving at home every day at six o&#x27; clock sharp to read &quot;Where&#x27;s My Cow?&quot; to him, an obligation that supersedes crime, conspiracy or international negotiations—his thinking being that if he ever missed it for a good reason, he might miss it for a bad reason, and that this might apply to everything he does, such as employing less-than-ethical methods in the pursuit of crime&quot;.

In &quot;Snuff&quot;, it is highlighted that not only can Young Sam read, but that he is quite advanced and now reads to his father. It is also shown that he is currently quite stuck on the study of poo, having read many books written by one Miss Felicity Beedle, whom he knows as &quot;the poo lady&quot;, and who has also written such books as &quot;Where&#x27;s My Cow?&quot;, &quot;The World of Poo&quot;, &quot;Melvin and the Enormous Boil&quot;, &quot;Geoffrey and the Magic Pillow Case&quot; and &quot;The Little Duckling Who Thought He Was an Elephant&quot;.

==Recent developments==
Vimes is, much to his own horror, becoming a politician. He remains in his soul a copper. Being a significant figure on the world stage just means he finds bigger crimes.

Vimes has seen involvement with 
* William de Worde, Otto Chriek and &quot;The Ankh-Morpork Times&quot; in &quot;The Truth&quot;
* The war between Borogravia and Zlobenia (and everyone else in the region) in &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;
* Moist von Lipwig in his running of the Post Office and the Grand Trunk Company&#x27;s monopoly on the &quot;clacks&quot; system in &quot;Going Postal&quot; and fraud involving the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork in &quot;Making Money&quot;
* Ethnic tensions between dwarfs and trolls in &quot;Thud!&quot;
* Ethnic tensions between humans and goblins in &quot;Snuff&quot;
* Tensions between dwarf factions over the Clacks and the new railway in &quot;Raising Steam&quot;

Terry Pratchett commented that the Vimes character made setting a story in Ankh-Morpork very difficult as it is almost impossible to create a story involving any sort of crime or politics without it rapidly becoming a Watch book.

==Bibliography==
Sam Vimes is the central character in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;, &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;, &quot;Jingo&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, &quot;Night Watch&quot;, &quot;Thud!&quot; and &quot;Snuff&quot;. He is a secondary character in &quot;The Truth&quot; and &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; and has cameos in &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, &quot;Going Postal&quot;, &quot;Making Money&quot;, &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot; and &quot;Raising Steam&quot;. He has also appeared in the &quot;City Watch Diary&quot; and the picture book &quot;Where&#x27;s My Cow?&quot;. He is also mentioned, although not by name, in &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;.

==Other media==
Vimes is played by Richard Dormer in the live-action television series &quot;The Watch&quot;, &quot;inspired by Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &#x27;Discworld&#x27; novels&quot;, rather than being a straight adaptation of specific stories.

&quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; was adapted for BBC Radio 5 in 1992 and starred John Wood as Vimes. &quot;Night Watch&quot; was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 2007, with actor Philip Jackson as Vimes.

While there have been a number of amateur stage productions of the books, a professional adaptation of &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; went on tour in 1998. Vimes was played by Paul Darrow, best known for his role in &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;.

Vimes also appeared in the game &quot;Discworld Noir&quot;, voiced by Rob Brydon.

==Reception and legacy==
Discussing Pratchett&#x27;s legacy in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Andrew Brown wrote that Vimes &quot;may be the most fully realised decent man in modern literature,&quot; while &quot;the Hollywood Reporter&quot; has described him as &quot;Inspector Morse-meets-Humphrey Bogart-esque&quot;.

The Cretaceous conifer species &quot;Pseudotorellia vimesiana&quot; is named after Sam Vimes.

In episode 3.4 &quot;Coda&quot; of the TV series&quot; Endeavour&quot;, Inspector Fred Thursday states that his old mentor was &quot;Sergeant Vimes, Cable Street&quot;.

<text>The fibula (: fibulae or fibulas) or calf bone is a leg bone on the lateral side of the tibia, to which it is connected above and below. It is the smaller of the two bones and, in proportion to its length, the most slender of all the long bones. Its upper extremity is small, placed toward the back of the head of the tibia, below the knee joint and excluded from the formation of this joint. Its lower extremity inclines a little forward, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the upper end; it projects below the tibia and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.

==Structure==
The bone has the following components:
* Lateral malleolus
* Interosseous membrane connecting the fibula to the tibia, forming a syndesmosis joint
* The superior tibiofibular articulation is an arthrodial joint between the lateral condyle of the tibia and the head of the fibula.
* The inferior tibiofibular articulation (tibiofibular syndesmosis) is formed by the rough, convex surface of the medial side of the lower end of the fibula, and a rough concave surface on the lateral side of the tibia.

===Blood supply===
The blood supply is important for planning free tissue transfer because the fibula is commonly used to reconstruct the mandible. The shaft is supplied in its middle third by a large nutrient vessel from the fibular artery. It is also perfused from its periosteum which receives many small branches from the fibular artery. The proximal head and the epiphysis are supplied by a branch of the anterior tibial artery. In harvesting the bone the middle third is always taken and the ends preserved (4 cm proximally and 6 cm distally)

===Development===
The fibula is ossified from &quot;three&quot; centers, one for the shaft, and one for either end. Ossification begins in the body about the eighth week of fetal life, and extends toward the extremities. At birth the ends are cartilaginous.

Ossification commences in the lower end in the second year, and in the upper about the fourth year. The lower epiphysis, the first to ossify, unites with the body about the twentieth year; the upper epiphysis joins about the twenty-fifth year.

===Head===
The upper extremity or head of the fibula is of an irregular quadrate form, presenting above a flattened articular surface, directed upward, forward, and medialward, for articulation with a corresponding surface on the lateral condyle of the tibia. 
On the lateral side is a thick and rough prominence continued behind into a pointed eminence, the apex (&quot;styloid process&quot;), which projects upward from the posterior part of the head.

The prominence, at its upper and lateral part, gives attachment to the tendon of the biceps femoris and to the fibular collateral ligament of the knee-joint, the ligament dividing the tendon into two parts.

The remaining part of the circumference of the head is rough, for the attachment of muscles and ligaments. 
It presents in front a tubercle for the origin of the upper and anterior fibers of the peroneus longus, and a surface for the attachment of the anterior ligament of the head; and behind, another tubercle, for the attachment of the posterior ligament of the head and the origin of the upper fibers of the soleus.

===Body===
The body of the fibula presents four borders - the antero-lateral, the antero-medial, the postero-lateral, and the postero-medial; and four surfaces - anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral.

;Borders
The antero-lateral border begins above in front of the head, runs vertically downward to a little below the middle of the bone, and then curving somewhat lateralward, bifurcates so as to embrace a triangular subcutaneous surface immediately above the lateral malleolus. This border gives attachment to an intermuscular septum, which separates the extensor muscles on the anterior surface of the leg from the peronaei longus and brevis on the lateral surface.

The antero-medial border, or interosseous crest, is situated close to the medial side of the preceding, and runs nearly parallel with it in the upper third of its extent, but diverges from it in the lower two-thirds. It begins above just beneath the head of the bone (sometimes it is quite indistinct for about 2.5 cm. below the head), and ends at the apex of a rough triangular surface immediately above the articular facet of the lateral malleolus. It serves for the attachment of the interosseous membrane, which separates the extensor muscles in front from the flexor muscles behind.

The postero-lateral border is prominent; it begins above at the apex, and ends below in the posterior border of the lateral malleolus. It is directed lateralward above, backward in the middle of its course, backward, and a little medialward below, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the peronaei on the lateral surface from the flexor muscles on the posterior surface.

The postero-medial border, sometimes called the oblique line, begins above at the medial side of the head, and ends by becoming continuous with the interosseous crest at the lower fourth of the bone. It is well-marked and prominent at the upper and middle parts of the bone. It gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the tibialis posterior from the soleus and flexor hallucis longus.

;Surfaces
The anterior surface is the interval between the antero-lateral and antero-medial borders. It is extremely narrow and flat in the upper third of its extent; broader and grooved longitudinally in its lower third; it serves for the origin of three muscles: the extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, and peroneus tertius.

The posterior surface is the space included between the postero-lateral and the postero-medial borders; it is continuous below with the triangular area above the articular surface of the lateral malleolus; it is directed backward above, backward and medialward at its middle, directly medialward below. Its upper third is rough, for the origin of the soleus; its lower part presents a triangular surface, connected to the tibia by a strong interosseous ligament; the intervening part of the surface is covered by the fibers of origin of the flexor hallucis longus. Near the middle of this surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed downward.

The medial surface is the interval included between the antero-medial and the postero-medial borders. It is grooved for the origin of the tibialis posterior.

The lateral surface is the space between the antero-lateral and postero-lateral borders. It is broad, and often deeply grooved; it is directed lateralward in the upper two-thirds of its course, backward in the lower third, where it is continuous with the posterior border of the lateral malleolus. This surface gives origin to the peronaei longus and brevis.

==Function==
The fibula does not carry any significant load (weight) of the body. It extends past the lower end of the tibia and forms the outer part of the ankle providing stability to this joint. It has grooves(a depression) for certain ligaments which gives them leverage and multiplies the muscle force. It provides attachment points for the following muscles:

==Clinical significance==
As much of the fibula can be removed without it impacting an individual&#x27;s ability to walk, the fibula is utilised as a source of bone material in fibular free flap surgeries.

===Fractures===
The most common type of fibula fracture is located at the distal end of the bone, and is classified as ankle fracture. In the Danis–Weber classification it has three categories:
*Type A: Fracture of the lateral malleolus, distal to the syndesmosis (the connection between the distal ends of the tibia and fibula).
*Type B: Fracture of the fibula at the level of the syndesmosis
*Type C: Fracture of the fibula proximal to the syndesmosis.

A Maisonneuve fracture is a spiral fracture of the proximal third of the fibula associated with a tear of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis and the interosseous membrane. There is an associated fracture of the medial malleolus or rupture of the deep deltoid ligament.

An avulsion fracture of the head of the fibula refers to the fracture of the fibular head because of a sudden contraction of the biceps femoris muscle that pulls its site of attachment on the bone. The attachment of the biceps femoris tendon on the fibular head is closely related to the lateral collateral ligament of the knee. Therefore, this ligament is prone to injury in this type of avulsion fracture.

==History==

===Etymology===
The word &quot;&quot; can be dated back to c. 1670. It derives from Latin &quot;fībula&quot;, which describes a clasp or brooch – see fibula (brooch) – and was first used in English for the smaller bone in the lower leg c. 1706. The bone was so called because it resembles a clasp like a modern safety pin.

The adjective peroneal referring to the fibula bone or its surrounding structures derives from : perónē, the Ancient Greek word for a clasp.

==Other animals==
Because the fibula bears relatively little weight in comparison with the tibia, it is typically narrower in all but the most primitive tetrapods. In many animals, it still articulates with the posterior part of the lower extremity of the femur, but this feature is frequently lost (as it is in humans). In some animals, the reduction of the fibula has proceeded even further than it has in humans, with the loss of the tarsal articulation, and, in extreme cases (such as the horse), partial fusion with the tibia.

<doc id="321815" wikidata="Q470117" url="?curid=321815" title="Liu Biao">
<text>Liu Biao () () ( 151 – September 208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He is best known for serving as the governor of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) from 192 until his death in 208. He was also a member of the extended family of the Han emperors through his ancestor Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing. Liu Biao was described as a handsome man and was over eight &quot;chi&quot; tall (1.86 metres).

==Life==

In 166 to 167, when Liu Biao was 17 (by East Asian reckoning), he became a student of Wang Chang (grandfather of Wang Can). At the time, Wang Chang was Administrator of Nanyang (南阳太守).

Liu Biao gained control of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) in 190 CE, when Dong Zhuo appointed him to the position after the death of its previous governor (or inspector), Wang Rui. Liu Biao later started a war against the warlord Yuan Shu and his minor vassal, Sun Jian. During the Battle of Xiangyang, Sun Jian was put in command of an army on Yuan Shu&#x27;s orders to assault Liu Biao in Jing Province. Liu Biao appointed Huang Zu to command the forces against Sun Jian. Huang Zu was outmaneuvered by Sun Jian, but the latter was hit by an arrow and killed, effectively ending the battle in favour of Liu Biao&#x27;s forces. Years after, Sun Jian&#x27;s two eldest sons, Sun Ce and Sun Quan, caused Liu Biao no end of trouble as they sought to avenge their father&#x27;s death. However, they did not cause Liu Biao&#x27;s demise as they targeted Huang Zu, who was a general under Liu Biao, instead of Liu Biao himself. While Cao Cao (in the north) was gaining strength, Liu Biao chose to neither help nor hinder his conquests, in part because he had been dealt a defeat against the forces of Sun Ce at the Battle of Shaxian (沙羡, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).

Around 200 CE, after Cao Cao&#x27;s total victory over his archrival warlord Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, Liu Biao still remained neutral, despite being one of the only other warlords in a position to oppose the two powers. However, Liu Biao eventually decided to shelter Liu Bei, an enemy of Cao Cao and relative in deep lineage when Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shao, where Liu Bei was previously sheltered after the events of 198 (Battle of Xiapi). This made Liu Biao a target of Cao Cao&#x27;s wrath as Liu Bei rebelled against Cao Cao just before the war against Yuan Shao. After Cao Cao finalised his unification of northern China in 208, he led a large army south to conquer Jing Province. With a decline in relations between Liu Biao and Liu Bei as a result of the meddling of Cai Mao&#x27;s family, Liu Biao&#x27;s people faced much difficulty. To make matters worse, Sun Quan&#x27;s army had defeated and killed Huang Zu at the Battle of Jiangxia and ultimately destroyed Liu Biao&#x27;s defences to the east.

Shortly after Cao Cao&#x27;s main army began its offensive, Liu Biao died of illness, probably a back ulcer. Liu Biao&#x27;s successor, his younger son Liu Cong, chose to surrender instead of resisting Cao Cao&#x27;s invasion. Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son, Liu Qi, who had had some disagreement with Liu Cong, joined the fleeing Liu Bei, leading to the Battle of Red Cliffs. The aftermath of that battle split Liu Biao&#x27;s former domain between the three resulting power blocs. Jing Province continued to be a flash point throughout the remaining years of the Han dynasty and well into the Three Kingdoms period, due to its strategic position between all three warring factions, with multiple battles and campaigns being fought for control of the province.

==Family==
Liu Biao&#x27;s first wife, Lady Chen (), bore him two sons: Liu Qi and Liu Cong. She died early, so Liu Biao took a second wife, Lady Cai () from the influential Cai family in Xiangyang. As Liu Cong married Lady Cai&#x27;s niece, the Cai family favoured him and wanted him to succeed his father as the Governor of Jing Province even though Liu Qi, being the elder son, should be the rightful successor. A sibling rivalry developed between Liu Cong and Liu Qi. (Note: In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Liu Qi and Liu Cong are half-brothers as Liu Cong&#x27;s mother is Lady Cai, but historically they were born to the same mother.)

Around mid-208, Liu Qi found an excuse to leave Xiangyang and serve as the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery. After Liu Biao&#x27;s death in late 208, Liu Cong became the new Governor of Jing Province with the support of the Cai family. Later that year, he surrendered to the warlord Cao Cao when the latter led his forces to attack Jing Province. Cao Cao then appointed him as the Inspector of Qing Province. On the other hand, Liu Qi, who was in Jiangxia Commandery, became an ally of Cao Cao&#x27;s rivals Liu Bei and Sun Quan at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208–209. After the battle, Liu Bei nominated Liu Qi to be the nominal Inspector of Jing Province, but Liu Qi died of illness later that year.

Liu Biao had at least one more son, Liu Xiu (), and a daughter. Liu Xiu followed Liu Cong when the latter surrendered to Cao Cao and went to Qing Province to serve as the provincial Inspector. In 210, Liu Xiu was appointed as the Administrator of Dong&#x27;an Commandery. He composed a number of poems, rhapsodies and formal hymns. Liu Biao&#x27;s daughter married Wang Can&#x27;s relative Wang Kai () and was the mother of Wang Ye (courtesy name Zhangxu); Wang Zhangxu was the father of Wang Hong and Wang Bi.

===Other relatives===
Liu Biao had two nephews: Liu Pan () and Liu Hu ().

Liu Pan participated in the battles against rival warlord Sun Ce under the command of Huang Zu, the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery. He was defeated in battle by Taishi Ci, a general under Sun Ce. Later, after Liu Biao pacified Changsha Commandery (長沙郡; covering parts of present-day Hunan), he put Liu Pan and Huang Zhong in charge of guarding the commandery. It is not known what happened to him after that. In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Liu Pan later came to serve Liu Bei through Huang Zhong&#x27;s recommendation.

Liu Hu also participated in the Battle of Shaxian against Sun Ce under Huang Zu&#x27;s leadership. Although many of Liu Biao&#x27;s subordinates who fought in the battle were reportedly killed in action, it is not known whether Liu Hu was one of them.

==In popular culture==

Liu Biao is featured as one of the available warlords that the player can choose from in Creative Assembly&#x27;s game &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;.

Ji Chenggong portrayed Liu Biao in the 2010 Chinese television series &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;.

<text>Guillaume Du Fay ( , ; also Dufay, Du Fayt; 5 August 1397 – 27 November 1474) was a composer and music theorist of early Renaissance music, who is variously described as French or Franco-Flemish. Considered the leading European composer of his time, his music was widely performed and reproduced. Du Fay was well-associated with composers of the Burgundian School, particularly his colleague Gilles Binchois, but was never a regular member of the Burgundian chapel himself.

While he is among the best-documented composers of his time, Du Fay&#x27;s birth and family is shrouded with uncertainty, though he was probably the illegitimate child of a priest. He was educated at Cambrai Cathedral, where his teachers included Nicolas Grenon and Richard Loqueville, among others. For the next decade, Du Fay worked throughout Europe: as a subdeacon in Cambrai, under Carlo I Malatesta in Rimini, for the House of Malatesta in Pesaro, and under Louis Aleman in Bologna, where he was ordained priest. As his fame began to spread, he settled in Rome in 1428 as musician of the prestigious papal choir, first under Pope Martin V and then Pope Eugene IV, where he wrote the motets &quot;Balsamus et munda cera&quot;, &quot;Ecclesie militantis&quot; and &quot;Supremum est mortalibus&quot;. Amid Rome&#x27;s financial and political disorder in the 1430s, Du Fay took a leave of absence from the choir to serve Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy. 

Du Fay returned to Italy in 1436, writing his most admired work, the complex motet &quot;Nuper Rosarum Flores&quot;, which celebrated the consecration of Filippo Brunelleschi&#x27;s dome for the Florence Cathedral. He later joined the recently-moved papal court in Bologna, and was associated with the House of Este in Ferrara. For the next eleven years, Du Fay was in Cambrai serving Philip the Good, under whom he may have written now-lost works on music theory. After a brief return to both Savoy and Italy, Du Fay settled in Cambrai in 1458, where his focus shifted from song and motet, to composing English-inspired cyclic masses based on cantus firmus, such as the &quot;Missa Ave regina celorum&quot;, the &quot;Missa Ecce ancilla Domini&quot;, the &quot;Missa L&#x27;Homme armé&quot; and the &quot;Missa Se la face ay pale&quot;. During his final years in Cambrai, Du Fay wrote his now-lost requiem and both met and influenced the leading musicians of his time, including Antoine Busnois, Loyset Compère, Johannes Tinctoris and particularly, Johannes Ockeghem.

Du Fay has been described as leading the first generation of European musicians who were primarily considered &#x27;composers&#x27; by occupation. His erratic career took him throughout Western Europe, forming a &#x27;cosmopolitan style&#x27; and an extensive oeuvre which included representatives of virtually every polyphonic genre of his time. Like Binchois, Du Fay was deeply influenced by the &quot;contenance angloise&quot; style of John Dunstaple, and synthesized it with a wide variety of other styles, including that of the famous &quot;Missa Caput&quot;, and the techniques of his younger contemporaries, Ockeghem and Busnois.
==Life==
===Background===

Du Fay&#x27;s life is better documented than &quot;almost any other [European] composer of the 15th century&quot;. The reasons for this are numerous, but especially informative are the thorough record keeping of the institutions he associated with and the many biographical or historical anecdotes integrated in his compositions. In addition, while records from many northern French cathedrals were either lost or destroyed, those from Cambrai Cathedral remain extant.

Modern scholarship generally spells the composer&#x27;s surname as two words, &#x27;Du Fay&#x27;. Before the late 20th century, however, spelling the name as single word—&#x27;Dufay&#x27;—was much more common. Archival discoveries from this period revealed that the surname was usually spelled as two words in documents of the 14th and 15th century, contrary to musical sources of that time. It seems that Du Fay&#x27;s parents spelt their surname as &#x27;Du Fayt&#x27;, but for unknown reasons the composer altered the spelling while active in Italy. Documents from the composer&#x27;s early years in Cambrai sometimes spelled his first name as Willaume, or a related form such as Willermus, Willem or Wilhelm.

===Early life===
From the evidence of his will, he was probably born in Beersel, in the vicinity of Brussels, the illegitimate child of an unknown priest and a woman named Marie Du Fayt. She moved with her son to Cambrai early in his life, staying with a relative who was a canon of the cathedral there. The link between the Du Fay family and the Cathedral of Cambrai is the sole reason a large amount of information is known about Du Fay&#x27;s early life, as the institute kept detailed records on all affiliated persons. His musical gifts were noticed by the cathedral authorities, who evidently gave him a thorough training in music; he studied with Rogier de Hesdin during the summer of 1409, and he was listed as a choirboy in the cathedral from 1409 to 1412. During those years he studied with Nicolas Malin, and the authorities must have been impressed with the boy&#x27;s gifts because they gave him his own copy of Villedieu&#x27;s &quot;Doctrinale Puerorum&quot; in 1411, a highly unusual event for one so young. In June 1414, aged around 16, he had already been given a benefice as chaplain at St. Géry, immediately adjacent to Cambrai where he studied under Nicolas Malin and Richard Loqueville. Later that year, on the evidence of music composed, and a later relationship with the Malatesta court, members of which he met on the trip, he probably went to the Council of Konstanz. He likely stayed there until 1418, at which time he returned to Cambrai.

===Cambrai to Italy and Savoy===
From November 1418 to 1420 he was a subdeacon at Cambrai Cathedral. In 1420 he left Cambrai for Italy – first to Rimini and then to Pesaro, where he worked for the Malatesta family. Several of his compositions can be dated to this period; they contain colloquial references to Italy. There he met the composers Hugo and Arnold de Lantins, who were also among the musicians of the Malatesta household. In 1424 Du Fay returned to Cambrai, because of the illness and subsequent death of the relative with whom his mother was staying. By 1426, however, he had returned to Italy. In Bologna, he entered the service of Cardinal Louis Aleman, the papal legate. While in Bologna he became a deacon, and by 1428 he was ordained priest.

Cardinal Aleman was driven from Bologna by the rival Canedoli family in 1428, and Du Fay also left, going to Rome. He became a member of the Papal Choir, the most prestigious musical establishment in Europe, serving first Pope Martin V, and then after the death of Pope Martin in 1431, Pope Eugene IV. By this time his fame had spread, and he had become one of the most respected musicians in Europe. As a consequence, honors in the form of benefices came to him from churches in his homeland. In 1434 he was appointed &quot;maistre de chappelle&quot; in Savoy, where he served Duke Amédée VIII. He had left Rome because of a crisis in the finances of the papal choir while seeking to escape the turbulence and uncertainty during the struggle between the papacy and the Council of Basel. By 1435 he was again in the service of the papal chapel, but this time it was in Florence – Pope Eugene having been driven from Rome in 1434 by the establishment of an insurrectionary republic there, sympathetic to the Council of Basel and the Conciliar movement. In 1436 Du Fay composed the festive motet &quot;Nuper rosarum flores&quot;, one of his most famous compositions, dedicated to and performed at the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, featuring Filippo Brunelleschi&#x27;s renowned dome. Eugene at this time lived in exile at the nearby church of Santa Maria Novella. 

The papal court moved to Bologna in April 1436, and by 10 May 1437 Du Fay was in possession of a university law degree. Since there is no evidence that Du Fay had studied law at Bologna, it is likely that the degree was granted by papal fiat. In September 1436, Du Fay achieved what he had long sought for, a lucrative benefice near the place of his birth. A certain Jehan Vivien went on to become the bishop of Nevers, vacating his canonicate at Cambrai in the process, and Du Fay was given Vivien&#x27;s canonicate by both &quot;motu proprio&quot; and Papal bull. Although the law degree was not necessary in holding the canonicate at Cambrai, Du Fay regarded both titles important enough to be mentioned in his funeral monument.

During this period Du Fay also began his long association with the Este family in Ferrara, some of the most important musical patrons of the Renaissance, and with which he probably had become acquainted during the days of his association with the Malatesta family; Rimini and Ferrara are not only geographically close, but the two families were related by marriage, and Du Fay composed at least one ballade for Niccolò III, Marquis of Ferrara. In 1437 Du Fay visited the town. When Niccolò died in 1441, the next Marquis maintained the contact with Du Fay, and not only continued financial support for the composer but copied and distributed some of his music.

===Return to Cambrai===
The struggle between the papacy and the Council of Basel continued through the 1430s, and evidently Du Fay realised that his own position might be threatened by the spreading conflict, especially since Pope Eugene was deposed in 1439 by the council and replaced by Duke Amédée of Savoy himself, as Pope (Antipope) Felix V. At this time Du Fay returned to his homeland, arriving in Cambrai by December of that year. One of the first documents mentioning him in Cambrai is dated 27 December 1440, when he received a delivery of 36 lots of wine for the feast of St. John the Evangelist.

Du Fay was to remain in Cambrai through the 1440s, and during this time he was also in the service of the Duke of Burgundy. While in Cambrai he collaborated with Nicolas Grenon on a complete revision of the liturgical musical collection of the cathedral, which included writing an extensive collection of polyphonic music for services. In addition to his musical work, he was active in the general administration of the cathedral. In 1444 his mother Marie died, and was buried in the cathedral; and in 1445 Du Fay moved into the house of the previous canon, which was to remain his primary residence for the rest of his life. Planchart speculates that around this time Du Fay might have written his works on music theory, both of which are lost.

===Travels to Savoy and Italy===
After the abdication of the last antipope (Felix V) in 1449, his own former employer Duke Amédée VIII of Savoy, the struggle between different factions within the Church began to heal, and Du Fay once again left Cambrai for points south. He went to Turin in 1450, shortly before the death of Duke Amédée, but returned to Cambrai later that year; and in 1452 he went back to Savoy yet again. This time he did not return to Cambrai for six years, and during that time he attempted to find either a benefice or an employment which would allow him to stay in Italy. Numerous compositions, including one of the four &quot;Lamentationes&quot; that he composed on the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, his famous mass based on &quot;Se la face ay pale&quot;, as well as a letter to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, survive from this period: but as he was unable to find a satisfactory position for his retirement, he returned north in 1458. While in Savoy he served more-or-less officially as choirmaster for Louis, Duke of Savoy, but he was more likely in a ceremonial role, since the records of the chapel never mention him.

===Final years in Cambrai===
When he returned to Cambrai for his final years, he was appointed canon of the cathedral. He was now the most renowned composer in Europe. Once again he established close ties to the court of Burgundy, and continued to compose music for them; in addition he received many visitors, including Busnois, Ockeghem, Tinctoris, and Loyset Compère, all of whom were decisive in the development of the polyphonic style of the next generation. During this period he probably wrote his mass based on the popular &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; tune, and he may be the author of the chanson &quot;Il sera par vous – L&#x27;homme armé&quot;, which uses the same cantus firmus; the latter composition may have been inspired by Philip the Good&#x27;s call for a new crusade against the Turks, who had recently captured Constantinople. He also wrote a Requiem mass around 1460, which is lost.

After an illness of several weeks, Du Fay died on 27 November 1474. He had requested that his motet &quot;Ave regina celorum&quot; be sung for him at his deathbed, but time was insufficient for this to be arranged. Instead, his now-lost Requiem Mass was performed during his funeral service. Du Fay was buried in the chapel of St. Étienne in the cathedral of Cambrai; his portrait was carved onto his tombstone. After the destruction of the cathedral during the French Revolution the tombstone was lost, but it was found in 1859 (it was being used to cover a well), and is now in the Palais des Beaux Arts museum in Lille.

==Music==

Du Fay composed in most of the common forms of the day, including masses, motets, Magnificats, hymns, simple chant settings in fauxbourdon, and antiphons within the area of sacred music, and rondeaux, ballades, virelais and a few other chanson types within the realm of secular music. None of his surviving music is specifically instrumental, although instruments were certainly used for some of his secular music. Seven complete Masses, 28 individual Mass movements, 15 settings of chant used in Mass propers, three Magnificats, two Benedicamus Domino settings, 15 antiphon settings (six of them Marian antiphons), 27 hymns, 22 motets (13 of these isorhythmic in the more angular, austere 14th-century style which gave way to more melodic, sensuous treble-dominated part-writing with phrases ending in the &quot;under-third&quot; cadence in Du Fay&#x27;s youth) and 87 chansons definitely by him have survived. Of Du Fay&#x27;s masses, his &quot;Missa se la face ay pale&quot; and &quot;Missa L&#x27;Homme armé&quot; are listed on AllMusic as essential compositions. Editions of Du Fay&#x27;s music include:

===Chant settings===

Many of Du Fay&#x27;s compositions were simple settings of chant, obviously designed for liturgical use, probably as substitutes for the unadorned chant, and can be seen as chant harmonizations. Often the harmonization used a technique of parallel writing known as fauxbourdon, as in the following example, a setting of the Marian antiphon &quot;Ave maris stella&quot;:

Du Fay may have been the first composer to use the term &quot;fauxbourdon&quot; for this simpler compositional style, prominent in 15th century liturgical music in general and that of the Burgundian school in particular.

===Secular music===

Most of Du Fay&#x27;s secular songs follow the formes fixes (rondeau, ballade, and virelai), which dominated secular European music of the 14th and 15th centuries. He also wrote a handful of Italian ballate, almost certainly while he was in Italy. As is the case with his motets, many of the songs were written for specific occasions, and many are datable, thus supplying useful biographical information.

Most of his songs are for three voices, using a texture dominated by the highest voice; the other two voices, unsupplied with text, were probably played by instruments. Occasionally Du Fay used four voices, but in a number of these songs the fourth voice was supplied by a later, usually anonymous, composer. Typically he used the rondeau form when writing love songs. His latest secular songs show influence from Busnois and Ockeghem, and the rhythmic and melodic differentiation between the voices is less; as in the work of other composers of the mid-15th century, he was beginning to tend towards the smooth polyphony which was to become the predominant style fifty years later.

A typical ballade is &quot;Resvellies vous et faites chiere lye&quot;, which was written in 1423 for the marriage of Carlo Malatesta and Vittoria di Lorenzo Colonna The musical form is &quot;aabC&quot; for each stanza, with &quot;C&quot; being the refrain.

===Theoretical writings===
Two written works on music theory by Du Fay have been documented, but neither has survived. The first of these is known from the theorist Gaffurius, who wrote in the margins of both his &quot;Ext, uetus parvus musicae&quot; and &quot;Tractatus brevis cantus plani&quot; references to a &quot;Musica&quot; by Du Fay. The citations, however, are very brief and reveal nothing more than information which might be found in any music treatise of the period. Given the supposed unimportance of the treatise, the biographer Francesco Rocco Rossi questions why Gaffurius would even include the citations, and suggests that perhaps he was relying on the elder composer&#x27;s authority. He concludes that &quot;the chronological proximity between the two musicians leads us to consider this testimony faithful.&quot; The second derives from the nineteenth-century musicologist François-Joseph Fétis, who claimed to have seen a sixteenth-century copy of a treatise ascribed to Du Fay, entitled &quot;Tractatus de musica mensurata et de proportionibus&quot; (&#x27;A Treatise on Measured Music and Proportions&#x27;). It was last documented as having been sold to a London book dealer in 1824. The testimony from Fétis remains problematic, as nothing of it is known aside from its name, making it impossible reconstruct.

If Du Fay did indeed write these works, he would be among a large tradition of &#x27;composer-theorists&#x27;, including Johannes Ciconia, Franchinus Gaffurius and Tinctoris, among others. It is possible that these documents are the same treatise, and the references to &quot;Musica&quot; were shorthand for the work seen by Fétis. Alternatively, Rossi notes that Fétis spoke specifically of a treatise influenced by Du Fay, which may not necessarily mean he was its author. Rossi, however, contends that the works are the same, while Planchart and Laurenz Lütteken list them separately in their catalogues.

==Portraits==

Two known depictions of Du Fay survive from his lifetime, both described by Planchart as &quot;simplified likenesses&quot;, which &quot;clearly depict the same person&quot;.

The earlier, and better known, is a miniature of him and Binchois from a manuscript of the poet Martin le Franc&#x27;s &quot;Le champion des dames&quot;, dated sometime before 1451. The illustration depicts Du Fay on the left beside a portative organ, with Binchois on the right holding a small harp. It is folio 98 recto of the manuscript, which is kept in ( 12476). In comparison to the later depiction, Fallows characterizes the miniature as &quot;more general in its iconography&quot;. The image&#x27;s illuminator is unknown, though it was likely Barthélemy Poignare, who was the manuscript&#x27;s scribe. Regardless of the illuminator&#x27;s identity, the artist probably knew Du Fay personally, as their work has been identified in other manuscripts originating in Cambrai.

The other is a carving on Du Fay&#x27;s funeral monument where he is kneeling in the bottom left corner. Standing behind him is Saint Waltrude of Mons, the eponymous saint of the church in Mons where he also held a benefice. To his right, three soldiers and an angel observe the resurrected Christ. The art historian Ludovic Nys has suggested it was based on a woodcut from Florence, though the art historian Douglas Brine has not found this convincing.

==Legacy==
Before Du Fay&#x27;s time, the concept of a &#x27;composer&#x27;—that is, a musician whose primary occupation is composition—was largely unfamiliar in Europe. The emergence of musicians who focused on composition above other musical endeavors arose in the 15th century, and was exemplified by Du Fay.

Due to their mutual importance, Du Fay and Binchois have been grouped together since their lifetimes. The musicologist Reinhard Strohm considers this misleading, noting that while Binchois &quot;earned his enormous reputation in the one genre in which he excelled as a composer, performer and possibly even poet, Du Fay&#x27;s creativity unfolded along many more musical lines&quot;. He furthers that Du Fay&#x27;s oeuvre is &quot;more diversified than that of any composer since Machaut&quot;.

Du Fay was one of the last composers to make use of late-medieval polyphonic structural techniques such as isorhythm, and one of the first to employ the more mellifluous harmonies, phrasing and melodies characteristic of the early Renaissance. His compositions within the larger genres (masses, motets and chansons) are mostly similar to each other; his renown is largely due to what was perceived as his perfect control of the forms in which he worked, as well as his gift for memorable and singable melody. During the 15th century he was universally regarded as the greatest composer of his time, an opinion that has largely survived to the present day.

Du Fay is the namesake of the Dufay Collective, an early music ensemble of historically informed performances.

<text>In materials science, a thermosetting polymer, often called a thermoset, is a polymer that is obtained by irreversibly hardening (&quot;curing&quot;) a soft solid or viscous liquid prepolymer (resin). Curing is induced by heat or suitable radiation and may be promoted by high pressure or mixing with a catalyst. Heat is not necessarily applied externally, and is often generated by the reaction of the resin with a curing agent (&quot;catalyst&quot;, &quot;hardener&quot;). Curing results in chemical reactions that create extensive cross-linking between polymer chains to produce an and insoluble polymer network.

The starting material for making thermosets is usually malleable or liquid prior to curing, and is often designed to be molded into the final shape. It may also be used as an adhesive. Once hardened, a thermoset cannot be melted for reshaping, in contrast to thermoplastic polymers which are commonly produced and distributed in the form of pellets, and shaped into the final product form by melting, pressing, or injection molding.

==Chemical process==
Curing a thermosetting resin transforms it into a plastic, or elastomer (rubber) by crosslinking or chain extension through the formation of covalent bonds between individual chains of the polymer. Crosslink density varies depending on the monomer or prepolymer mix, and the mechanism of crosslinking:

Acrylic resins, polyesters and vinyl esters with unsaturated sites at the ends or on the backbone are generally linked by copolymerisation with unsaturated monomer diluents, with cure initiated by free radicals generated from ionizing radiation or by the photolytic or thermal decomposition of a radical initiator – the intensity of crosslinking is influenced by the degree of backbone unsaturation in the prepolymer;

Epoxy functional resins can be homo-polymerized with anionic or cationic catalysts and heat, or copolymerised through nucleophilic addition reactions with multifunctional crosslinking agents which are also known as curing agents or hardeners. As reaction proceeds, larger and larger molecules are formed and highly branched crosslinked structures develop, the rate of cure being influenced by the physical form and functionality of epoxy resins and curing agents – elevated temperature postcuring induces secondary crosslinking of backbone hydroxyl functionality which condense to form ether bonds;

Polyurethanes form when isocyanate resins and prepolymers are combined with low- or high-molecular weight polyols, with strict stoichiometric ratios being essential to control nucleophilic addition polymerisation – the degree of crosslinking and resulting physical type (elastomer or plastic) is adjusted from the molecular weight and functionality of isocyanate resins, prepolymers, and the exact combinations of diols, triols and polyols selected, with the rate of reaction being strongly influenced by catalysts and inhibitors; polyureas form virtually instantaneously when isocyanate resins are combined with long-chain amine functional polyether or polyester resins and short-chain diamine extenders – the amine-isocyanate nucleophilic addition reaction does not require catalysts. Polyureas also form when isocyanate resins come into contact with moisture;

Phenolic, amino, and furan resins all cured by polycondensation involving the release of water and heat, with cure initiation and polymerisation exotherm control influenced by curing temperature, catalyst selection or loading and processing method or pressure – the degree of pre-polymerisation and level of residual hydroxymethyl content in the resins determine the crosslink density.

Polybenzoxazines are cured by an exothermal ring-opening polymerisation without releasing any chemical, which translates in near zero shrinkage upon polymerisation.

Thermosetting polymer mixtures based on thermosetting resin monomers and pre-polymers can be formulated and applied and processed in a variety of ways to create distinctive cured properties that cannot be achieved with thermoplastic polymers or inorganic materials.

== Properties ==
Thermosetting plastics are generally stronger than thermoplastic materials due to the three-dimensional network of bonds (crosslinking), and are also better suited to high-temperature applications up to the decomposition temperature since they keep their shape as strong covalent bonds between polymer chains cannot be broken easily. The higher the crosslink density and aromatic content of a thermoset polymer, the higher the resistance to heat degradation and chemical attack. Mechanical strength and hardness also improve with crosslink density, although at the expense of brittleness. They normally decompose before melting.

Hard, plastic thermosets may undergo permanent or plastic deformation under load. Elastomers, which are soft and springy or rubbery and can be deformed and revert to their original shape on loading release.

Conventional thermoset plastics or elastomers cannot be melted and re-shaped after they are cured. This usually prevents recycling for the same purpose, except as filler material. New developments involving thermoset epoxy resins which on controlled and contained heating form crosslinked networks permit repeatedly reshaping, like silica glass by reversible covalent bond exchange reactions on reheating above the glass transition temperature. There are also thermoset polyurethanes shown to have transient properties and which can thus be reprocessed or recycled.

==Fiber-reinforced materials==
When compounded with fibers, thermosetting resins form fiber-reinforced polymer composites, which are used in the fabrication of factory-finished structural composite OEM or replacement parts, and as site-applied, cured and finished composite repair and protection materials. When used as the binder for aggregates and other solid fillers, they form particulate-reinforced polymer composites, which are used for factory-applied protective coating or component manufacture, and for site-applied and cured construction, or maintenance purposes.

==Materials==
* Epoxy resin used as the matrix component in many fiber reinforced plastics such as glass-reinforced plastic and graphite-reinforced plastic; casting; electronics encapsulation; construction; protective coatings; adhesives; sealing and joining.

<text>In number theory, an abundant number or excessive number is a positive integer for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number. The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16. The amount by which the sum exceeds the number is the abundance. The number 12 has an abundance of 4, for example.

==Definition==
An &quot;abundant number&quot; is a natural number for which the sum of divisors satisfies , or, equivalently, the sum of proper divisors (or aliquot sum) satisfies .

The &quot;abundance&quot; of a natural number is the integer (equivalently, ).

==Examples==

The first 28 abundant numbers are:

:12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 102, 104, 108, 112, 114, 120, ... .

For example, the proper divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12, whose sum is 36. Because 36 is greater than 24, the number 24 is abundant. Its abundance is 36 − 24 = 12.

==Properties==
*The smallest odd abundant number is 945.
*The smallest abundant number not divisible by 2 or by 3 is 5391411025 whose distinct prime factors are 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29 . An algorithm given by Iannucci in 2005 shows how to find the smallest abundant number not divisible by the first &quot;k&quot; primes. If formula_1 represents the smallest abundant number not divisible by the first &quot;k&quot; primes then for all formula_2 we have
::formula_3 
:for sufficiently large &quot;k&quot;.
*Every multiple of a perfect number (except the perfect number itself) is abundant. For example, every multiple of 6 greater than 6 is abundant because formula_4
*Every multiple of an abundant number is abundant. For example, every multiple of 20 (including 20 itself) is abundant because formula_5
* Consequently, infinitely many even and odd abundant numbers exist.

*Furthermore, the set of abundant numbers has a non-zero natural density. Marc Deléglise showed in 1998 that the natural density of the set of abundant numbers and perfect numbers is between 0.2474 and 0.2480.
* An abundant number which is not the multiple of an abundant number or perfect number (i.e. all its proper divisors are deficient) is called a primitive abundant number
* An abundant number whose abundance is greater than any lower number is called a highly abundant number, and one whose relative abundance (i.e. s(n)/n ) is greater than any lower number is called a superabundant number
*Every integer greater than 20161 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. The largest even number that is not the sum of two abundant numbers is 46.
*An abundant number which is not a semiperfect number is called a weird number. An abundant number with abundance 1 is called a quasiperfect number, although none have yet been found.
*Every abundant number is a multiple of either a perfect number or a primitive abundant number.

==Related concepts==

Numbers whose sum of proper factors equals the number itself (such as 6 and 28) are called perfect numbers, while numbers whose sum of proper factors is less than the number itself are called deficient numbers. The first known classification of numbers as deficient, perfect or abundant was by Nicomachus in his &quot;Introductio Arithmetica&quot; (circa 100 AD), which described abundant numbers as like deformed animals with too many limbs.

The abundancy index of &quot;n&quot; is the ratio &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)/&quot;n&quot;. Distinct numbers &quot;n&quot;1, &quot;n&quot;2, ... (whether abundant or not) with the same abundancy index are called friendly numbers.

The sequence (&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;) of least numbers &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; &quot;kn&quot;, in which &quot;a&quot;2 = 12 corresponds to the first abundant number, grows very quickly .

The smallest odd integer with abundancy index exceeding 3 is 1018976683725 = 33 × 52 × 72 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29.

If p = (&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;pn&quot;) is a list of primes, then p is termed &quot;abundant&quot; if some integer composed only of primes in p is abundant. A necessary and sufficient condition for this is that the product of &quot;pi&quot;/(&quot;pi&quot; − 1) be &gt; 2.

<text>Xenharmonic music is music that uses a tuning system that is unlike the 12-tone equal temperament scale. It was named by Ivor Darreg, from the Greek &quot;xenos&quot; (Greek ξένος) meaning both &quot;foreign&quot; and &quot;hospitable&quot;. He stated that it was &quot;intended to include just intonation and such temperaments as the 5-, 7-, and 11-tone, along with the higher-numbered really-microtonal systems as far as one wishes to go.&quot;

John Chalmers, author of &quot;Divisions of the Tetrachord&quot;, wrote, &quot;The converse of this definition is that music which can be performed in 12-tone equal temperament without significant loss of its identity is not truly &quot;microtonal&quot;.&quot; Thus xenharmonic music may be distinguished from twelve-tone equal temperament, as well as use of intonation and equal temperaments, by the use of unfamiliar intervals, harmonies, and timbres.

Theorists other than Chalmers consider xenharmonic and non-xenharmonic to be subjective. Edward Foote, in his program notes for &quot;6 degrees of tonality&quot;, refers to the differences in his response to the tunings he uses, such as Kirnberger and DeMorgan, from &quot;shocking,&quot; to &quot;too subtle to immediately notice,&quot; saying that &quot;[t]emperaments are new territory for 20th-century ears. The first-time listener may find it shocking to hear the harmony change &#x27;color&#x27; during modulations or too subtle to immediately notice.&quot;

==Diatonic xenharmonic music==

Music also can share much of the familiar territory of twelve-tone music yet also contain xenharmonic features. For example, Easley Blackwood, author of &quot;The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings&quot; (1985), wrote many etudes in equal temperament systems ranging from 12 to 24 tones. These etudes bring out connections and resemblances to twelve-tone music as well as various xenharmonic characteristics, reflected in &quot;Twelve Microtonal Etudes for Electronic Music Media&quot;.

About his 16-tone etude, Blackwood wrote: 

Darreg explains: &quot;I devised the term &#x27;xenharmonic&#x27; to refer to everything that does not sound like 12-tone equal temperament.&quot;

== Tunings, instruments, and composers ==
Music using scales or tuning other than 12-tone equal temperament can be classified as xenharmonic music. This includes other equal divisions of the octave and scales based on extended just intonation.

Tunings derived from the partials or overtones of physical objects with an inharmonic spectrum or overtone series such as rods, prongs, plates, discs, spheroids and rocks occasionally are the basis of xenharmonic exploration. William Colvig, who worked with the composer Lou Harrison created the &quot;tubulong&quot;, a set of xenharmonic tubes.

Electronic music composed with arbitrarily chosen xenharmonic scales was explored on the album &quot;Radionics Radio: An Album of Musical Radionic Thought Frequencies&quot; (2016) by British composer Daniel Wilson, who composed with frequency-runs submitted by users of a web application that replicated radionics-based electronic soundmaking equipment used by Oxford&#x27;s De La Warr Laboratories in the late 1940s. Elaine Walker (composer) is an electronic musician who writes xenharmonic music by building new types of music keyboards. 

The Non-Pythagorean scale utilized by Robert Schneider of The Apples in Stereo, based on a sequence of logarithms, may be considered xenharmonic, as well as Annie Gosfield&#x27;s purposefully &quot;out of tune&quot; sampler-based music using non systematic tunings and the work of other composers including Elodie Lauten, Wendy Carlos, Ivor Darreg, and Paul Erlich.
