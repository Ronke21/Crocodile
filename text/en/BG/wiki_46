<text>Sverdlovsk (; ) or Dovzhansk () is an industrial city in Luhansk Oblast of Ukraine, near the internationally recognized border with Russia. This is the residence of Dovzhansk urban hromada and Dovzhansk Raion (district). It is located approximately from the administrative center of the oblast, Luhansk. Its population is estimated to be 

Sverdlovsk has its origins in several mining settlements that appeared in the late 18th century and 19th century. They were united into a single city in 1938, which grew over time despite destructive occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II. It has been controlled by the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic since 2014.

==History==
===Imperial Russian and Soviet history===
The city has its origins in a settlement named Dovzhykove-Orlovsk–µ that originated in the late 18th century. It was later renamed to Sharapkyne. The first coal mines in the area began development in the 1870s.

On 22 October 1938, several of the mining settlements in the area, along with the &quot;Sverdlov&quot; mine, were merged into a new city named Sverdlovsk, named after Bolshevik leader Yakov Sverdlov. The city became the center of Sverdlovsk Raion. A local newspaper began being published in the city in November 1938.

During World War II, Sverdlovsk was occupied by Nazi Germany between 20 July 1942 and 17 February 1943. During the occupation, the Nazis massacred communists and Jews, as well as murdering other civilians for minor infractions. The population waged partisan warfare against the occupiers. As the Nazis retreated from the settlement, they burned down and blew up several buildings, and kidnapped 4,500 people to Germany for forced labor.

In 1962, Sverdlovsk was designated as a city of oblast significance; while it still served as the administrative center of Sverdlovsk Raion, it was no longer part of it, and was instead subordinated directly to Luhansk Oblast.

===21st century===

On 4 June 2014, at the beginning of the war in Donbas, militants proclaiming loyalty to the Russian-backed separatist Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic (LPR) seized control of the border guards&#x27; base at Sverdlovsk, as well as taking over the city itself. The Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, both considered proxies of Russia, went on to seize large swathes of eastern Ukraine. Using August 2014 footage from occupied Sverdlovsk, investigators identified a Russian tank in one of the separatist columns that &quot;only have come from across the border in Russia&quot;, confirming direct Russian involvement in the war.

On 22 August the same year, it was discovered that the LPR authorities in Sverdlovsk - as well as Chervonopartyzansk and other nearby settlements - had forbidden shops owned by people who held pro-Ukrainian views from selling bread. Residents of the settlements began making a petition to end this practice, calling the bans on selling food &quot;genocide&quot;. On 23 August, a group of Russian &quot;humanitarian&quot; trucks arrived with packets of salt and water. However, the trucks were reportedly &quot;half-empty&quot;, and the salt packets had unusual prices. On 11 September 2014, it was reported that in the past month, sixteen people in Sverdlovsk had died of starvation in what Ukrainian media called a &quot;famine in Donbas&quot;. Elderly people with disabilities living on their own were particularly at risk of starvation, now that social services were unable to access the city. On 24 September, &quot;Information Resistance&quot; coordinator Dmytro Tymchuk reported that the Russian military, who had been fighting alongside the LPR militants in the war, were using an abandoned mine in Sverdlovsk as an impromptu mass grave for its dead soldiers in an attempt to hide casualties and obscure its role in the war.

On 4 October 2014, there was a &quot;hunger riot&quot; in Sverdlovsk in protest against the LPR, citing lack of payment of wages, lack of food, the collapse of the baking system, and widespread looting and robbery. Unknown people threw grenades at the organizers of the protests. This came in the wake of larger-scale &quot;hunger riots&quot; throughout occupied Luhansk Oblast. On 17 November 2014, a second, larger-scale rally broke out in protest of the occupation. People poured blue and yellow paint (the national colors of Ukraine) over the gate of an administrative building and threatened the militants. The militants fired automatic weapons in an attempt to disperse the rally, but this failed. About 2,000 people were taking place in the rally, and they called for the separatists to leave the city, and chanted &quot;Sverdlovsk is Ukraine!&quot; By 18 November, activists reported that 64 people in the city had now died of starvation.

In 2016, Sverdlovsk was renamed &quot;Dovzhansk&quot; and Sverdlovsk Raion was renamed to &quot;Dovzhansk Raion&quot; by the Ukrainian government as a result of decommunization laws. In 2020, the designation of a city of oblast significance was abolished across Ukraine, and Dovzhansk has since been officially subordinated to Dovzhansk Raion.

On 21 August 2022, during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Luhansk Oblast governor Serhiy Haidai reported that the LPR authorities had forcibly conscripted 430 mine workers in Dovzhansk. According to Russian state TV, only women and the elderly were left to work the mines. Systematic abduction of children has taken place in the city, with 200 children being taken to camps in Krasnodar Krai in Russia for &quot;patriotic training&quot; on 17 August 2023.

==Economy==
Sverdlovsk is an industrial city. It has twelve mines and four coal enrichment plants, as well as metalworking and machine-building industries. There are repair shops for mining equipment and a clothes factory.

==Demographics==
As of the 2001 census, the city&#x27;s population was 72,531. Its ethnic composition was as follows:
* Russians: 48.6%
* Ukrainians: 46%
* Belarusians: 1.2%
* Others: 2.4%

<text>Gstaad ( , ) is a town in the German-speaking section of the Canton of Bern in southwestern Switzerland. It is part of the municipality of Saanen and is known as a major ski resort and a popular destination amongst high society and the international jet set. The winter campus of the Institut Le Rosey is located in Gstaad. Gstaad has a population of about 9,200 and is located above sea level.

==History==

During the Middle Ages, it was part of the district of Saanen (Gessenay) belonging to the Savoyard county of Gruy√®re. The town core developed at the fork in the trails into the Valais and Vaud. It had an inn, a warehouse for storing trade goods and oxen to help pull wagons over the alpine passes by the 13th-14th centuries. The St. Nicholas chapel was built in the town in 1402, while the murals are from the second half of the 15th century. The town was dominated by cattle farming and agriculture until the great fire of 1898. It was then rebuilt to support the growing tourism industry. The construction of the Montreux‚ÄìLenk im Simmental line in 1905 and the construction of ski runs (the Ski Club of Saanen open in 1905 followed in 1907 by the Ski Club of Gstaad). The first ski school in Gstaad opened in 1923. The Eagle Ski Club opened in 1957, and was funded by Charles Greville, 7th Earl of Warwick. In a short time, there were more than 1,000 hotel beds in the region.

The residents, hoteliers, shopkeepers and tourist offices helped to promote Gstaad to international attention. They supported the construction of ice rinks, tennis courts, swimming pools, ski jumps, and ski and hiking areas. The first ski lifts at Funi opened in 1934-44 and were followed by a number of gondolas, ski, and chair lifts. The Gstaad Palace opened in 1913 as Gstaad&#x27;s first luxury hotel. In 1942 the Saanen-Gstaad airfield was opened for military and civil aviation. Helicopter rides were added later and in 1980 balloon flights became available as well. During the World Wars and the Great Depression, the tourism industry suffered and many hotels closed. After World War II, many of the large hotels remained closed, but they were replaced with a number of smaller non-hotel accommodation (chalets, apartment houses, residences). Most of the modern resorts and small hotels are built out of wood and retain traditional design elements.

The Gstaad Polo Club was founded in 1992, and the Gstaad Yacht Club in 1998.

Long known for its walking and hiking trails of varying degrees of difficulty, the mountain air and ambiance attract guests year-round from around the world. Gstaad is also known for its ski and cross-country slopes and winter hiking trails. Glacier 3000 is a major attraction, offering guaranteed snow from December to March and unique high-altitude experiences, including the world‚Äôs first summit-to-summit suspension footbridge with views of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. Gstaad also offers distinctive culinary experiences, such as the ‚ÄòFondueland Gstaad,‚Äô where visitors can enjoy fondue in oversized outdoor caquelon pots set amidst scenic Alpine landscapes. To facilitate this, fondue backpacks contain all the necessary ingredients and equipment that can be rented from local dairies, allowing for a dining experience in nature.

Gstaad, named &quot;The Place&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in the 1960s, is widely known for its famous part-time residents and vacationers. Famous regular visitors to Gstaad have included Madonna, Charles III and Princess Diana, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, haute couture designer Valentino Garavani, writer William F. Buckley, Jr., and various members of the Cavendish family. Many British bands and musicians would play at L&#x27;Atelier, a club in Gstaad, in the 1960s and 1970s; one such band was Merlin &#x27;Q&#x27; (later Edison Lighthouse), who stayed a whole winter. The town has been coined ‚ÄúThe Swiss Alps‚Äô Best-Kept Secret,‚Äù by Los Angeles magazine.

Regan (played by Meghan Fox) interjects and tells them to tell the truth about whether either of them has actually ever been to Gstaad. Feeling insecure, Winston presses Regan about whether she has been to Gstaad and she responds by saying &quot;No I haven&#x27;t been there. Should I be ashamed of that or can we all just tell the truth about whether we&#x27;ve been to &quot;Shtaad.&quot;

<doc id="314383" wikidata="Q7644269" url="?curid=314383" title="Supertask">
<text>In philosophy, a supertask is a countably infinite sequence of operations that occur sequentially within a finite interval of time. Supertasks are called hypertasks when the number of operations becomes uncountably infinite. A hypertask that includes one task for each ordinal number is called an ultratask. The term &quot;supertask&quot; was coined by the philosopher James F. Thomson, who devised Thomson&#x27;s lamp. The term &quot;hypertask&quot; derives from Clark and Read in their paper of that name.

==History==
===Zeno===
====Motion====
The origin of the interest in supertasks is normally attributed to Zeno of Elea. Zeno claimed that motion was impossible. He argued as follows: suppose our burgeoning &quot;mover&quot;, Achilles say, wishes to move from A to B. To achieve this he must traverse half the distance from A to B. To get from the midpoint of AB to B, Achilles must traverse half &quot;this&quot; distance, and so on and so forth. However many times he performs one of these &quot;traversing&quot; tasks, there is another one left for him to do before he arrives at B. Thus it follows, according to Zeno, that motion (travelling a non-zero distance in finite time) is a supertask. Zeno further argues that supertasks are not possible (how can this sequence be completed if for each traversing there is another one to come?). It follows that motion is impossible.

Zeno&#x27;s argument takes the following form:

# Motion is a supertask, because the completion of motion over any set distance involves an infinite number of steps
# Supertasks are impossible
# Therefore, motion is impossible

Most subsequent philosophers reject Zeno&#x27;s bold conclusion in favor of common sense. Instead, they reverse the argument and take it as a proof by contradiction where the possibility of motion is taken for granted. They accept the possibility of motion and apply &quot;modus tollens&quot; (contrapositive) to Zeno&#x27;s argument to reach the conclusion that either motion is not a supertask or not all supertasks are impossible.

====Achilles and the tortoise====
Zeno himself also discusses the notion of what he calls &quot;Achilles and the tortoise&quot;. Suppose that Achilles is the fastest runner, and moves at a speed of 1¬†m/s. Achilles chases a tortoise, an animal renowned for being slow, that moves at 0.1¬†m/s. However, the tortoise starts 0.9 metres ahead. Common sense seems to decree that Achilles will catch up with the tortoise after exactly 1 second, but Zeno argues that this is not the case. He instead suggests that Achilles must inevitably come up to the point where the tortoise has started from, but by the time he has accomplished this, the tortoise will already have moved on to another point. This continues, and every time Achilles reaches the mark where the tortoise was, the tortoise will have reached a new point that Achilles will have to catch up with; while it begins with 0.9 metres, it becomes an additional 0.09 metres, then 0.009 metres, and so on, infinitely. While these distances will grow very small, they will remain finite, while Achilles&#x27; chasing of the tortoise will become an unending supertask. Much commentary has been made on this particular paradox; many assert that it finds a loophole in common sense.

===Thomson===

James F. Thomson believed that motion was not a supertask, and he emphatically denied that supertasks are possible. He considered a lamp that may either be on or off. At time the lamp is off, and the switch is flipped on at ; after that, the switch is flipped after waiting for half the time as before. Thomson asks what is the state at , when the switch has been flipped infinitely many times. He reasons that it cannot be on because there was never a time when it was not subsequently turned off, and vice versa, and reaches a contradiction. He concludes that supertasks are impossible.

===Benacerraf===
Paul Benacerraf believes that supertasks are at least logically possible despite Thomson&#x27;s apparent contradiction. Benacerraf agrees with Thomson insofar as that the experiment he outlined does not determine the state of the lamp at t = 1. However he disagrees with Thomson that he can derive a contradiction from this, since the state of the lamp at t = 1 cannot be logically determined by the preceding states.

===Modern literature===
Most of the modern literature comes from the descendants of Benacerraf, those who tacitly accept the possibility of supertasks. Philosophers who reject their possibility tend not to reject them on grounds such as Thomson&#x27;s but because they have qualms with the notion of infinity itself. Of course there are exceptions. For example, McLaughlin claims that Thomson&#x27;s lamp is inconsistent if it is analyzed with internal set theory, a variant of real analysis.

====Philosophy of mathematics====
If supertasks are possible, then the truth or falsehood of unknown propositions of number theory, such as Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, or even undecidable propositions could be determined in a finite amount of time by a brute-force search of the set of all natural numbers. This would, however, be in contradiction with the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis. Some have argued this poses a problem for intuitionism, since the intuitionist must distinguish between things that cannot in fact be proven (because they are too long or complicated; for example Boolos&#x27;s &quot;Curious Inference&quot;) but nonetheless are considered &quot;provable&quot;, and those which &quot;are&quot; provable by infinite brute force in the above sense.

====Physical possibility====
Some have claimed, Thomson&#x27;s lamp is physically impossible since it must have parts moving at speeds faster than the speed of light (e.g., the lamp switch). Adolf Gr√ºnbaum suggests that the lamp could have a strip of wire which, when lifted, disrupts the circuit and turns off the lamp; this strip could then be lifted by a smaller distance each time the lamp is to be turned off, maintaining a constant velocity. 

However, such a design would ultimately fail, as eventually the distance between the contacts would be so small as to allow electrons to jump the gap, preventing the circuit from being broken at all. Still, for either a human or any device, to perceive or act upon the state of the lamp some measurement has to be done, for example the light from the lamp would have to reach an eye or a sensor. 

Any such measurement will take a fixed frame of time, no matter how small and, therefore, at some point measurement of the state will be impossible. Since the state at t=1 can not be determined even in principle, it is not meaningful to speak of the lamp being either on or off.

Other physically possible supertasks have been suggested. In one proposal, one person (or entity) counts upward from 1, taking an infinite amount of time, while another person observes this from a frame of reference where this occurs in a finite space of time. For the counter, this is not a supertask, but for the observer, it is. (This could theoretically occur due to time dilation, for example if the observer were falling into a black hole while observing a counter whose position is fixed relative to the singularity.)

Gustavo E. Romero in the paper &#x27;The collapse of supertasks&#x27; maintains that any attempt to carry out a supertask will result in the formation of a black hole, making supertasks physically impossible.

====Super Turing machines====

The impact of supertasks on theoretical computer science has triggered some new and interesting work, for example Hamkins and Lewis &quot;Infinite Time Turing Machine&quot;.

==Prominent supertasks==
===Ross‚ÄìLittlewood paradox===
Suppose there is a jar capable of containing infinitely many marbles and an infinite collection of marbles labelled 1, 2, 3, and so on. At time &quot;t&quot; = 0, marbles 1 through 10 are placed in the jar and marble 1 is taken out. At &quot;t&quot; = 0.5, marbles 11 through 20 are placed in the jar and marble 2 is taken out; at &quot;t&quot; = 0.75, marbles 21 through 30 are put in the jar and marble 3 is taken out; and in general at time &quot;t&quot; = 1 ‚àí 0.5&quot;n&quot;, marbles 10&quot;n&quot; + 1 through 10&quot;n&quot; + 10 are placed in the jar and marble &quot;n&quot; + 1 is taken out. How many marbles are in the jar at time &quot;t&quot; = 1?

One argument states that there should be infinitely many marbles in the jar, because at each step before &quot;t&quot; = 1 the number of marbles increases from the previous step and does so unboundedly. A second argument, however, shows that the jar is empty. Consider the following argument: if the jar is non-empty, then there must be a marble in the jar. Let us say that that marble is labeled with the number &quot;n&quot;. But at time &quot;t&quot; = 1 ‚àí 0.5&quot;n&quot; - 1, the &quot;n&quot;th marble has been taken out, so marble &quot;n&quot; cannot be in the jar. This is a contradiction, so the jar must be empty. The Ross‚ÄìLittlewood paradox is that here we have two seemingly perfectly good arguments with completely opposite conclusions.

===Benardete&#x27;s paradox===
There has been considerable interest in J. A. Benardete‚Äôs ‚ÄúParadox of the Gods‚Äù:

===Grim Reaper paradox===

Inspired by J. A. Benardete‚Äôs paradox regarding an infinite series of assassins, David Chalmers describes the paradox as follows:
It has gained significance in philosophy via its use in arguing for a finite past, thereby bearing relevance to the Kalam cosmological argument.

===Davies&#x27; super-machine===
Proposed by E. Brian Davies, this is a machine that can, in the space of half an hour, create an exact replica of itself that is half its size and capable of twice its replication speed. This replica will in turn create an even faster version of itself with the same specifications, resulting in a supertask that finishes after an hour. If, additionally, the machines create a communication link between parent and child machine that yields successively faster bandwidth and the machines are capable of simple arithmetic, the machines can be used to perform brute-force proofs of unknown conjectures. However, Davies also points out that due to fundamental properties of the real universe such as quantum mechanics, thermal noise and information theory his machine cannot actually be built.

[[Zygmunt Florenty Wr√≥blewski|Zygmunt Florenty Wr√≥blewski]] (: ; 28 October 1845 ‚Äì 16 April 1888) was a Polish [[physicist]] and [[chemist]]. Together with [[Karol Olszewski]], he was the first scientist in the world to liquify [[nitrogen]] in 1883.

==Biography==
Wr√≥blewski was born in [[Grodno]] ([[Russian Empire]], now in [[Belarus]]). He studied at [[Kiev University]]. After a six-year exile for participating in the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia]], he studied in Berlin and [[Heidelberg]]. He defended his doctoral dissertation at [[Munich University]] in 1876 and became an assistant professor at [[University of Strasbourg|Strasburg University]]. In 1880 he became a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]].

Wr√≥blewski was introduced to gas [[condensation]] in Paris by Professor Caillet at the [[√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure]]. When Wr√≥blewski was offered a chair in physics at [[Jagiellonian University]], he accepted it. At [[Krak√≥w]] he began studying gases and soon established a collaboration with [[Karol Olszewski]].

While studying [[carbonic acid]], Wr√≥blewski discovered the [[Carbon dioxide clathrate|CO2 hydrate]]. He reported this finding in 1882.

On 29 March 1883 Wr√≥blewski and Olszewski used a new method of condensing [[oxygen]], and on 13 April the same year‚Äî[[nitrogen]].

[[Karol Olszewski]] continued the experiments, using an improved Pictet cascade apparatus, and [[carbon dioxide]], boiling [[ethylene]] in [[vacuum]], and boiling nitrogen and boiling air as cooling agents.

He died on 16 April 1888. While studying the physical properties of [[hydrogen]], Wr√≥blewski upset a [[kerosene lamp]] and was severely burned. He died soon after at a [[Krak√≥w]] hospital and was buried at the [[Rakowicki Cemetery]] in Krak√≥w.

In 1976, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) passed a decision to give the name of [[Wr√≥blewski (crater)|Wr√≥blewski]] to one of the craters of the [[Moon]] in honour of the chemist.

<doc id="314392" wikidata="Q1324866" url="?curid=314392" title="New Woman">
<text>The New Woman was a feminist ideal that emerged in the late 19th century and had a profound influence well into the 20th century. In 1894, writer Sarah Grand (1854‚Äì1943) used the term &quot;new woman&quot; in an influential article to refer to independent women seeking radical change. In response the English writer Ouida (Maria Louisa Ram√©) used the term as the title of a follow-up article. The term was further popularized by British-American writer Henry James, who used it to describe the growth in the number of feminist, educated, independent career women in Europe and the United States. The New Woman pushed the limits set by a male-dominated society. Independence was not simply a matter of the mind; it also involved physical changes in activity and dress, as activities such as bicycling expanded women&#x27;s ability to engage with a broader, more active world.

==Changing social roles==

Writer Henry James was among the authors who popularized the term &quot;New Woman,&quot; a figure who was represented in the heroines of his novels‚Äîamong them the title character of the novella &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; (serialized 1878) and Isabel Archer in &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; (serialized 1880‚Äì81). According to historian Ruth Bordin, the term New Woman was: 

Peggy Meyer Sherry notes in her article: &quot;Telling Her Story: British Women of Letters of the Victorian Era&quot;: &quot;[It was] Sarah Grand who invented the &quot;New Woman,&quot; saw society as her laboratory and her novels as case studies.&quot;

The &quot;New Woman&quot; was also a nickname given to Ella Hepworth Dixon, the English author of the novel &quot;The Story of a Modern Woman&quot;.

===Postsecondary and professional education===

Although the New Woman was becoming a more active participant in life as a member of society and the workforce, she was most often depicted exerting her autonomy in the domestic and private spheres in literature, theatre, and other artistic representations. The 19th-century suffragette movement to gain women&#x27;s democratic rights was the most significant influence on the New Woman. Education and employment opportunities for women were increasing as western countries became more urban and industrialized. The &quot;pink-collar&quot; workforce gave women a foothold in the business and institutional sphere. In 1870, women in the professions comprised only 6.4 percent of the United States&#x27; non-agricultural workforce; by 1910, that figure had risen to 10 percent, then to 13.3 percent in 1920.

More women were winning the right to attend university or college. Some were obtaining a professional education and becoming lawyers, doctors, journalists, and professors, often at prestigious all-female colleges such as the Seven Sisters schools: Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Radcliffe, Smith, Vassar, and Wellesley. The New Woman in the United States was participating in post-secondary education in larger numbers by the turn of the 20th century.

===Sexuality and social expectations===
Autonomy was a radical goal for women at the end of the 19th century. It was historically a truism that women were always legally and economically dependent on their husbands, male relatives, or social and charitable institutions. The emergence of education and career opportunities for women in the late 19th century, as well as new legal rights to property (although not yet the vote), meant that they stepped into a new position of freedom and choice when it came to marital and sexual partners. The New Woman placed great importance on her sexual autonomy, but that was difficult to put into practice as society still voiced loud disapproval of any sign of female licentiousness. For women in the Victorian era, any sexual activity outside of marriage was judged to be immoral. Divorce law changes during the late 19th century gave rise to a New Woman who could survive a divorce with her economic independence intact, and an increasing number of divorced women remarried. Maintaining social respectability while exercising legal rights still judged to be immoral by many was a challenge for the New Woman: 

It was clear in the novels of Henry James that however free his heroines felt to exercise their intellectual and sexual autonomy, they ultimately paid a price for their choices.

Some admirers of the New Woman trend found freedom to engage in lesbian relationships through their networking in women&#x27;s groups. It has been said that for some of them, &quot;loving other women became a way to escape what they saw as the probabilities of male domination inherent in a heterosexual relationship&quot;. For others, it may have been the case that economic independence meant that they were not answerable to a guardian for their sexual or other relationship choices, and they exercised that new freedom.

===Class differences===
The New Woman was a result of the growing respectability of postsecondary education and employment for women who belonged to the privileged upper classes of society. University education itself was still a badge of affluence for men at the turn of the 20th century, and fewer than 10 percent of people in the United States had a post-secondary education during the era.

The women entering universities generally belonged to the white middle class. Consequentially, the working class, people of color, and immigrants were often left behind in the race to achieve this new feminist model. Woman writers belonging to these marginalized communities often critiqued the way in which their newfound freedom regarding their gender came at the expense of their race, ethnicity, or class. Although they acknowledged and respected the independence of the New Woman, they could not ignore the issue that the standards for a New Woman of the Progressive Era could, for the most part, only be attained by white middle-class women.

===Cycling===


The bicycle had a significant impact on the lives of women in a variety of areas, not least in the area of Victorian dress reform, also known as the &quot;rational dress movement&quot;. The greatest impact it had on the societal role of women occurred in the 1890s during the bicycle craze that swept American and European society. The bicycle gave women a greater amount of social mobility. The feminist Annie Londonderry accomplished her around-the-globe bicycle trip during this decade, becoming the first woman to do so. Elizabeth Robins Pennell, who started her writing career with a biography of Mary Wollstonecraft, pioneered bicycle touring with her travelogues around England and Europe in the late nineteenth century.
Due to the price and the various payment plans offered by American bicycle companies, the bicycle was affordable to the majority of people. However, the bicycle impacted upper and middle class white women the most. This transformed their role in society from remaining in the private or domestic sphere as caregivers, wives, and mothers to one of greater public appearance and involvement in the community.

==Literature==
Literary discussions of the expanding potential for women in English society date back at least to Maria Edgeworth&#x27;s &quot;Belinda&quot; (1801) and Elizabeth Barrett&#x27;s &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot; (1856), which explored a woman&#x27;s plight between conventional marriage and the radical possibility that a woman could become an independent artist. In drama, the late nineteenth century saw such &quot;New Woman&quot; plays as Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1879) and &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (1890), Henry Arthur Jones&#x27;s play &quot;The Case of Rebellious Susan&quot; (1894) and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s controversial &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; (1893) and &quot;Candida&quot; (1898). 
According to a joke by Max Beerbohm (1872‚Äì1956), &quot;The New Woman sprang fully armed from Ibsen&#x27;s brain&quot; (an allusion to the birth of Athena).

Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; makes prominent mention of the New Woman in its pages, with its two main female characters discussing the changing roles of women and the New Woman in particular. Lucy Westenra laments she can not marry several men at once, after she has been proposed to by three different men. Her friend, Mina, later writes in her diary that the New Woman would do the proposing herself. Feminist analyses of &quot;Dracula&quot; regard male anxiety about the Woman Question and female sexuality as central to the book.

The term was used by writer Charles Reade in his novel &quot;A Woman Hater&quot;, originally published serially in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and in three volumes in 1877. Of particular interest in the context are Chapters XIV and XV in volume two, which made the case for the equal treatment of women.

In fiction, New Woman writers included Olive Schreiner, Annie Sophie Cory (Victoria Cross), Sarah Grand, Mona Caird, George Egerton, Ella D&#x27;Arcy and Ella Hepworth Dixon. Some examples of New Woman literature are Victoria Cross&#x27;s &quot;Anna Lombard&quot; (1901), Dixon&#x27;s &quot;The Story of a Modern Woman&quot; and H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; (1909). Kate Chopin&#x27;s &quot;The Awakening&quot; (1899) also deserves mention, especially within the context of narratives derived from Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1856), both of which chronicle a woman&#x27;s doomed search for independence and self-realization through sexual experimentation.

The emergence of the fashion-oriented and party-going flapper in the 1920s marked the end of the New Woman era (now also known as First-wave feminism).

==Art==

By the late 19th century, art schools and academies had begun to offer more opportunities for artistic instruction to women. The Union of Women Painters &amp; Sculptors, founded in 1881, supported women artists and offered exhibition opportunities. Women artists became &quot;increasingly vocal and confident&quot; in promoting women&#x27;s work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern and freer &quot;New Woman&quot;.

In the late 19th century, Charles Dana Gibson depicted the &quot;New Woman&quot; in his piece, &quot;The Reason Dinner was Late&quot;, which shows a woman painting a policeman.

Artists &quot;played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying this emerging type through their own lives&quot;. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries about 88% of the subscribers of 11,000 magazines and periodicals were women. As women entered the artist community, publishers hired women to create illustrations that depicted the world through a woman&#x27;s perspective. Successful illustrators included Jennie Augusta Brownscombe, Jessie Wilcox Smith, Rose O&#x27;Neill, Elizabeth Shippen Green, and Violet Oakley.

== Commentary ==


==Opposition==

In the early 1890s, daughters of middle class Catholics expressed a desire to attend institution of higher education. Catholic leaders expressed their concern as studying at these &quot;Protestant&quot; schools, as the Church described it, might threaten the women&#x27;s Catholic faith. The Church also viewed the New Woman as a threat to traditional womanhood and the social order. The Church cited past accomplished Catholic women, including saints, to critique the New Woman. By citing those women, the Church also argued that it was the Church, not the New Woman movement, that offered women the best opportunities. Others also critiqued the New Woman for her implied sexual freedom and for her desire to participate in matters that are best left to men&#x27;s judgment. As Cummings writes, the New Woman was accused of being &quot;essentially uncatholic and anti-catholic&quot;.

== Other countries ==

=== China ===
The New Woman of China began to emerge off of the pages of Chinese literature beginning mostly in the 1920s. However, ideas surrounding feminism, gender equality, and modernization began in China long before the 1920s New Woman emerged from its context. The New Woman of China and the movement itself went through various incarnations, changing with the social and political landscape it emerged from.

==== Fall of the Qing (1911) to pre-May Fourth Era (pre-1920s) ====
It was during the early years of the New Culture Movement and pre-May Fourth era that the term &quot;New Woman&quot; first emerged in China. This term, used by Hu Shi (1891-1962) during a 1918 lecture, suggested that women were more than just &quot;good wives and wise mothers&quot; and instead pushed for women&#x27;s freedom and individuality in the larger national framework. However, Hu Shi along with a handful of other male intellectuals, were the minority pushing for women‚Äôs involvement in society.

Influenced heavily by the New Culture movement, which emphasised condemning the ‚Äúslavish Confucian tradition which was known to sacrifice the individual for conformity and force rigid notions of subservience, loyalty, and female chastity,&quot; the New Woman who emerged in the 1910s were far less progressive than their later 1920s counterparts. New Women during the early Republican period had to contend heavily with the ‚Äòwoman question‚Äô a question regarding how to &quot;address issues of modernity and the nation&quot; and women&#x27;s role in both. During this period, women&#x27;s education was promoted, but as a tool to create women who would be equipped to ‚Äúraise healthy and morally sound sons‚Äù, who would then help build a new China. So even though education was encouraged for women, it was not for their personal benefit but instead for the state and nation. Early New Women such as Hu Binxia, an early editor for &quot;The Ladies Journal&quot;, promoted in her articles the ideas of education to learn how to support a family and participate in the cult of domesticity.

However, like minded male reformers to Hu Shi, Chen Duxiu promoted a very different kind of women for China‚Äôs changing political, social, and economic landscape pre-May Fourth era. Founder of the &quot;New Youth&quot; journal, Chen Duxiu called for gender and family reforms and pushed for the emancipation of women and the dismantling of the restrictive Confucian family system. Chen, like other radical-minded male intellectuals of his time, believed ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs equality to be the hallmark of a modern civilization‚Äù and the strength behind a nation. Thus ‚Äúcustoms of concubinage, foot binding, widow chastity, and female seclusion‚Äù, from these male intellectual&#x27;s view points, needed to be eliminated to allow women to freely participate in the nation&#x27;s rebuilding.

While Chinese men at this time backed the idea of the dismantling the Confucian system, they did not do so solely for women to be freed from it. Chinese male intellectuals backed women&#x27;s emancipation from the system, but not their emancipation as individuals. The hope was that women could be freed from Confucianism&#x27;s confines and then mobilized for the cause of nationalism. This can be seen by such reformers as Liang Qichao who believed that the &quot;future strength of the nation was the ultimate goal, and that women&#x27;s rights were only a means&quot; to meet that goal, not the end of it.

Furthermore, the New Women of China during this time drew heavily on American and European literature, feminist movements, and female missionaries along with Japanese feminists and New Women too. Both Chinese men and women looked to the United States, which was believed to be the most advanced in regards to women&#x27;s rights, as a source of inspiration. Education and economic opportunities, such as those that Chinese male intellectuals of the time promoted for women, were considered to be the hallmark of a free and independent women. These ideas of economic independence and educational opportunities were promoted by both the male and female intellectuals of the time, but both promoted them for different reasons as noted above.

==== Post-May Fourth Era (1920s) to the early 1930s ====
Changes to the New Woman and their ideals began after the May Fourth Movement. While the movement emerged from the context of World War I (Treaty of Versailles), its new ideas regarding the economy, education, politics, and gender roles had a profound effect on the New Women in China and the direction of the movement. Where previous New Women during the early twentieth century had been influenced by women in the United States, Europe, and Japan, the New Women of China began during the 1920s to using their own stories and ideas as their inspiration. In this, while Western literary figures and writers such as Nora in Hendrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House (1879)&quot; still had massive popularity and influence, male and female writers of the time used these writings as templates but applied Chinese societal problems and themes to the storylines and characters. So while they had a connection to these original works, they featured both larger global struggles of women, such as free love relationships, and more individual problems for Chinese women, such as dealing with the Confucian family system and filial piety.

The New Women in China, both as women living in China and literary figures in books, still faced pressures in the 1920s and 1930s to &quot;exemplify familial and national devotion&quot; however. With that said though, not everyone shared this sentiment. For example, during the late 1910s and early 1920s, the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Journal&quot; promoted ideas of individualism and romantic love relationships and marriages instead of arranged. Other writers believed a strong Chinese nation would arise only when &quot;education, suffrage, social freedoms, and economic independence&quot; were granted to women. Thus, while women seemed to gain more freedom in their choice or marriage partner and the possibility of working outside of the domestic realm, the rhetoric and meaning behind these new choices for women, hidden behind modernist vocabulary, remained the same: establishing a family or devoting oneself to the nation.

An important lecture, &quot;What Happens After Nora Leaves Home&quot;, was given at Beijing Women&#x27;s Normal College in 1923 which discussed women in Chinese society and their inability to become truly independent from both the family and from their male partners. This talk given by Lu Xun, a revolutionary writer concerned with women‚Äôs issues amongst many other things, cautioned women against idealizing Western female literary figures such as Hendrik Ibsen&#x27;s Nora in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House (1879)&quot; . Lu Xun noted that while her actions were bold, Nora did not have any means to support herself once she left home, leaving her with limited options of survival. Lu Xun was not against women seeking independence, he was however, pointing out the limited access women had to economic self-sufficiency and social welfare.

==== Nora&#x27;s influence on early to mid twentieth century Chinese literature ====
Regardless of Lu Xun&#x27;s warning, Western literary figures, like Nora in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1879), came to be seen as great examples of New Women to female and male readers of the time. Nora, the heroine of &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, who leaves her patriarchal marriage and ventures out into the world alone, was used as an ideal archetype by female and male Chinese writers in their own stories and essays.

When looking at female Chinese writers of the time, Ding Ling and Chen Xuezhao were both heavily influenced by the New Women and their message. Chen Xuezhao, a Chinese feminist of her time, advocated for women to be liberated from the patriarchal system allowing them the ability to contribute more wholeheartedly to society. Her 1927 essay published in the &quot;New Woman&quot; magazine, noted how women wished to remain single and thus able to ‚Äúpursue their own personal fulfilment and livelihood‚Äù, becoming ‚Äúactive participants in civic life‚Äù.

Another New Woman writer, Ding Ling, by using fiction, wrote about the lives of women, their sexuality, and the ‚Äúcomplications they faced making a life for themselves in a modernizing society‚Äù. Influenced by her single-mother, Ding Ling presented herself as the epitome of a New Woman as she was starkly against foot-binding, chopped her hair into a short bob cut, went to male and female schools, and refused an arranged marriage. Her most influential work, &quot;Miss Sophia&#x27;s Diary&quot;, inspired by Ibsen‚Äôs &quot;A Doll‚Äôs House&quot;, details a New Woman&#x27;s journey with &quot;sexual and emotional frustrations of romantic love as a &#x27;liberated&#x27; women in a patriarchal society&quot;. Ding Ling&#x27;s writing focused on criticizing the patriarchal family, the marriage system, concepts of female chastity, and the double standards women faced.

Male writers of the time too, used Ibsen&#x27;s story as inspiration for their own versions to the Nora tale. For example, Hu Shi&#x27;s play &quot;Zhongshen dashi&quot; (The greatest event in life; 1917), stars a Nora-influenced character whose story highlights the idea of free love relationships for both men and women, moving away from the idea of arranged, loveless marriages.

Lu Xun was another male writer of the time who created literature using these New Women characters. As mentioned above, Lu Xun gave a speech in 1923 noting how Nora had no economic means to turn to when she left home. His talk and subsequent story on the topic, demonstrated that in Chinese society, women lacked the economic funds needed to be able to survive outside of her family and husband. As Nora did not have any means to generate an income for herself once she left, and because she lacked an education, she was left with few options of survival. His story, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot; (1924), while not explicitly about the New Women of China, went on to criticize the idea of monitoring women&#x27;s chastity and virtue. However, his story &quot;Regret for the Past&quot;, whose female protagonist is modelled after Nora, shows his female lead leaving her family home to be with her lover, only to eventually return to her family home in the end due to a lack of economic independence. Demonstrating Lu Xun&#x27;s belief that China had not created ways for women to survive outside of their family or husband&#x27;s homes.

==== Characteristics of the New Woman in literature and in Chinese society in the 1920s‚Äì1930s ====
While not from the 1920s and 1930s, an incredibly early example of the archetype of the Chinese New Woman was Ida Kahn/Kang Aide/Kang Cheng (December 6, 1873 ‚Äì November 9, 1931). An early New Woman in the context of the Chinese New Woman movement, Ida Kahn, born in China, was adopted by an American female missionary who took her in 1892 to the United States to receive a college education in medicine. There are a few reasons Kahn stands out as an early archetype of the eventual 1920s New Woman. The first is the education she received. Kahn received two degrees. The degree she received was in medicine, which she put to work back in China when she became a doctor in the early nineteen hundreds. The second degree Kahn received was a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature in 1911. What is unique about this, other than the fact that she received a degree in medicine in the first place, was that this second degree was done solely out of personal interest for the topic. While later New Women were encouraged to receive an education, it was not for one&#x27;s personal benefit but instead to become better wives and mothers, so this early example of a Chinese woman receiving an education out of interest is an anomaly of the time. The second is marital status. Kahn never married and instead devoted her life to the cause of medicine and healing others. Kahn remained single her whole life, breaking away from the tradition of marrying and establishing a family. Lastly, Kahn worked as a physician for the majority of her life. Kahn devoted her life to the Chinese state and its people. Kahn was later turned into a symbol of national reform by Liang Qichao who, noting the anomaly she posed as a female figure in China, morphed Kahn into a &quot;central image of modernity&quot;.

The 1920s to 1930s New Woman in China from the page to real life shared similarities and differences both with each other and with the early New Woman, Ida Kahn. For example, Ding Ling, the female writer, exemplified the ultimate New Woman both in her visual appearance and in her ideas and stories. As noted earlier, Ding Ling&#x27;s physical appearance aligned with other New Women as she &quot;had her long, braided hair cut short&quot;, a typical style of the New Woman. Her ideas and literature also aligned with 1920s New Woman as her stories depicted female sexual desires and women&#x27;s liberation from the patriarchal family.

New Women, according to Barbara Molony, emerged in the late 1920s, out of the New Culture Movement and were viewed as the &quot;educated, patriotic embodiment of a new gender order working to overcome the oppressions of the Confucian family system and traditional society&quot;. New Women were usually female students who in appearance wore eyeglasses, had short bobbed hair, and unbound feet, and in practice usually lived on their own, had open, casual relationships, and aimed to be economically independent from their family.

However, the Modern Girl, who also emerged in the late 1920s and early 1930s, came to signify &quot;commodified, glamorous, and individualist women&quot;. Each of these two types of women in China came to exemplify very different styles and beliefs. The New Woman both in literature and in real life were &quot;associated with leftist and progressive intellectuals, equated with positive aspects of modernity&quot; and seen as educated, political and nationalistic in her view points. The New Woman was all things positive in relation to modernity and &quot;symbolized the vision of a future strong nation&quot; but with aspects of modernity and revolution. So while the New Woman expressed the positive changes that came with modernity, the Modern Girl &quot;expressed men&#x27;s disillusionment with modernity and their fears of female subjectivity&quot;. While neither of these two women were necessarily beloved by males wishing to keep the status quo, the New Woman was more accepted as she was believed by men, even though she advocated for free love and economic independence, to still uphold family and national values.

==== Suicide and the Chinese New Woman ====
Even with these apparent newfound freedoms (ability to work outside the domestic domain, economic stability, and choice in marriage partners), some New Women still felt constricted by the system and thus, unheard. To make their opinions about this system heard, some New Women followed the old Confucian tradition of female suicide as a means to get their message across to the general populace.

According to Margery Wolf, women&#x27;s suicide in China was less about ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù and more about ‚ÄúWho? Who drove her to this? Who is responsible?‚Äù. This can be seen with the case of Xi Shangzhen, an office employee who in 1922 committed suicide for reasons that are still contested. Xi was an unmarried office employee who, disgruntled at her boss hung herself in her place of work. There are two possible reasons for her decision that are known. The first is that her boss lost her money on the stock market causing her to be put in a hard financial situation. The second reason, which Bryna Goodman believes to be most likely was that Xi&#x27;s boss, whom she was having an affair with, asked her to be his concubine.

As Margery Wolf points out, ‚Äúsuicide was considered a proper response for women whose honour had been tampered with‚Äù. This also relates to virtue, chastity, or rumours about either. In this case, Xi who was an educated woman working a job, felt her virtue had been infringed upon and insulted, and thus made a bold decision to make her case of insult known to the general public. The death of Xi was shocking as it showed a conflict between the modern and Confucian value systems. As noted by Barbara Molony, Xi embodied the typical New Woman as she was an &quot;educated, unmarried woman and supporting herself with an independent career&quot;. Xi was viewed as a New Woman who through her job, was able to obtain economic independence but through her actions of suicide, demonstrated a very long tradition in Chinese history of female suicide for the sake of virtue.

=== Germany ===
After women gained the right to vote and be elected in the wake of World War I in Germany, the &quot;Neue Frau&quot; became a trope in German popular culture, representing new discourses about sexuality, reproduction and urban mass society. This German New Woman was portrayed by authors such as Elsa Herrmann (&quot;So ist die neue Frau&quot;, 1929) and Irmgard Keun (&quot;Das kunstseidene M√§dchen&quot;, 1932, translated as &quot;The Artificial Silk Girl&quot;, 1933). These urbane, sexually liberated working women wore androgynous clothes, cut their hair short, and were widely seen as apolitical. The New Women in Germany was closely connected to the lesbian subculture in Weimar Republic.

=== Korea ===
In Korea in the 1920s, the New Woman&#x27;s Movement arose among educated Korean women who protested the Confucian patriarchal tradition. During a period of Japanese imperialism, Christianity was seen as an impetus for Korean nationalism and had been involved in events such as the March 1st Movement of 1919 for independence. Hence, in contrast to many Western contexts, Christianity informed the ideals of Western feminism and women&#x27;s education, especially through the Ewha Womans University. The New Woman&#x27;s Movement is often seen to be connected with the Korean magazine &quot;New Women&quot; (), founded in 1920 by Kim Iry≈èp, which included other key figures such as Na Hye-s≈èk.

Originally, the term ‚ÄòNew Woman‚Äô was associated with education, enlightenment, and social consciousness, while the term ‚ÄòModern Girl‚Äô carried connotations of frivolity and excess. While these terms continue to carry some of these original meanings, they eventually came to be used interchangeably. New Women included female students and workers, and as women started working, they formed a new urban working class, endowing them with economic power, the ability to participate in modern consumerism, independence from their families, and the opportunity to engage in more social contact with men. While these changes led to greater female freedom, Modern Girls and New Women drew severe criticism from male intellectuals who argued that these modern women were consumed with Western capitalism, were consumer-oriented and hypersensitive to trends and fads, morally depraved, and sexually promiscuous. However, more moderate authors like Yu Kwang-Yol and Song So-In described the Modern Girl as an embodiment of the transition from old traditions to new practices and recognized that, while the trend could focus on material consumption, New Women and Modern Girls also strove to cultivate a moral vision and higher knowledge. Nonetheless, the majority of representations of New Women and Modern Girls in mass media reduced them to caricatures with short hair, make-up, and Western clothing, while ignoring their strides in knowledge, skill, and identity.

According to a study by Na Kyong-Hui, more than 230 editorials on the ‚Äúwomen question‚Äù appeared in the Choson Ilbo and the Tonga Ilbo, two of the most widely circulated newspapers during the colonial period, from 1920-1940. One of the main characteristics of Modern Girls criticized in these newspapers was New Women‚Äôs trend towards consumerism. Who who, unable to prioritize necessary items and exercise self-control in their shopping, wore expensive clothing beyond their means, perhaps to the detriment to their families were ridiculed. Modern Girls were also seem as being hypersensitivity to fashion trends, and there was a shift in the power dynamic between husbands and wives, with men now groveling to meet their wives‚Äô demands. However, this condemnation of consumerism went beyond gender: it was rooted in Korea‚Äôs relationship with Japan. Consuming Japanese goods was believed to inadvertently contribute to Korea‚Äôs colonial subordination to Japan while framing Japanese oppressors as progressive and Korea as a remote, pre-industrial land. Authors like Yu Kwang-Yeoul argued that the Korean masses were so ‚Äúblinded by the glittering, seductive products‚Äù of Japan that they failed to recognize Japan‚Äôs ‚Äúassault on Korea‚Äôs economy.‚Äù Criticisms of female consumerism also reveal men‚Äôs underlying fear of losing their status and social position, for women‚Äôs economic involvement challenged traditional gender roles and centuries of Confucian practice.

This exploration of changing gender roles was further debated in cartoons, particularly around the departure from the &quot;hyeonmo yangcheo&quot; (wise mother and good wife) rhetoric and women‚Äôs increased participation in public life. It was believed that as women became educated and entered the workforce, they also became masculinized while men became feminized, leading to ambiguity between the sexes. Women&#x27;s bobbed hair and short skirts also represent another form of rebellion against cultural norms and traditional gender roles. Despite male opposition to the new fashion styles, modern women held their own ideas of what was attractive, comfortable, and functional, particularly in the work setting, and defined their beauty, sexuality, and identity for themselves. It was also thought that women could not simultaneously be New Women and good mothers and wives.

The final topic frequently represented in the Modern Girl debate was the issue of female sexuality. In contrast to women in the Joseon dynasty who covered their heads and could not go outside without a male chaperone, changes in fashion and ideology led to more exposed female bodies. New Women argued that the new trends were stylish and comfortable, but male intellectuals criticized Modern Girls for being unvirtuous and bringing inappropriate attention to their sexuality. Furthermore, during the Joseon dynasty, men were the pursuers. However, New Women were shown to be proactive and aggressive in their quest for a husband.

New Women and Modern Girls were depicted in art in many different ways. Kim Eun-Ho‚Äôs &quot;The Gaze&quot; features a beautiful woman standing in a field of wildflowers under a weeping willow. She holds a bouquet in her hands and wears Western clothing including a short skirt, long jacket, high heels, and shawl around her shoulders. Kim Eun-Ho‚Äôs representation of the New Woman using warm, soft colors and sloping lines portrays her in a romantic light, where she is the passive female being caught unexpectedly in a private moment. This strongly contrasts Na Hye-Seok‚Äôs representation of herself in &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, which conveys her identity as an artist, a New Woman, and an intellectual. Her facial features, clothing, and Cubism-inspired painting style are also distinctly Western, and her expression is mask-like and masculine. The dark colors and solid representation of her body challenge the stereotypical representation of women in Korean art, for instead of being delicate and submissive, she is serious and powerful.

=== Japan ===
In the early 1900s, the Western concept of the New Woman began to circulate in Japan. The term for New Woman, &quot;Atarashii Onna&quot;, was first formally used in July 1910 during a lecture by Tokyo Imperial University professor Tsubouchi Shoyo. &quot;Atarashii Onna&quot; was used with derision by critics to denote a woman who was promiscuous, shallow, and unfilial, the opposite of Meiji Japan&#x27;s ideals of &quot;ry≈çsai kenbo&quot;. Despite this members of &quot;Seit≈ç&quot;, a woman&#x27;s magazine which became a symbol of Japan&#x27;s New Women, such as Hiratsuka Raich≈ç and It≈ç Noe, proudly embraced the term. Educated women who functioned as both literary and political figures embodied the concept of Japan&#x27;s New Women in the 1910s, using literary platforms such as &quot;Seit≈ç&quot; to circulate their ideas amongst the public.

&quot;Seit≈ç&quot; was first published in September 1911 and featured many prominent female writers, such as Hiratsuka Raich≈ç, who herself lived an untraditional life as a woman who pursued a love affair with a young male writer. As the founder and editor of &quot;Seit≈ç&quot;, Hiratsuka Raich≈ç had this to say about being a new woman: &quot;I am a New Woman. As New Women, we have always insisted that women are also human beings. It is common knowledge that we have opposed the existing morality, and have maintained that women have the right to express themselves as individuals and to be respected as individuals.&quot; Another revolutionary female writer, Yosano Akiko, wrote a poem celebrating the women&#x27;s movement in &quot;Seit≈ç&quot;&#x27;s inaugural issue, entitled &quot;The Day the Mountains Move&quot;. What made &quot;Seit≈ç&quot; simultaneously controversial and powerful was how it rallied against Japan&#x27;s existing family system based on patriarchy, instead championing romantic love and a woman&#x27;s independence. Like Hiratsuka Raich≈ç, &quot;Seit≈ç&quot; writer Ito Noe similarly practiced the ideals she preached in writing in her own life, leaving an unsatisfactory marriage to study in Tokyo and marrying twice more. In her essay &quot;The Path of the New Woman&quot;, published in the January 1913 issue of &quot;Seit≈ç&quot;, It≈ç Noe proclaimed her commitment to pursuing the path of a New Woman and urged others to do the same despite societal backlash: &quot;How could anyone imagine that the way of the New Woman, the way of this pioneer, be anything less than one continuous, torturous struggle?&quot;

&quot;Seit≈ç&quot;&#x27;s transgressive content and style fueled numerous attacks. Multiple newspapers and academic circles who advocated for Japan&#x27;s traditional family system attacked Hiratsuka Raich≈ç and the other women of &quot;Seit≈ç&quot;. People worried that the concept of the New Woman being promulgated in &quot;Seit≈ç&quot; would disrupt the existing order and social stability.

One essential distinction between the iteration of the New Woman that emerged in Japan and that which emerged in many Western countries is that the Japanese New Woman was not directly connected to the national suffrage movement. As Japanese men were not granted universal male suffrage until 1925, women&#x27;s suffrage in Japan became an issue of political leverage more than a decade later than conversations about the New Woman were occurring. By the mid-1920s, Japan‚Äôs &quot;New Woman&quot; had been replaced by the idea of the &quot;Modern Girl&quot; or &quot;Modan GƒÅru&quot;. While separate entities, both New Women and Modern Girls reflected modernity, embodied Western influence, and were labelled by the press as too transgressive.

=== Soviet Union ===
The concept of the New Woman was introduced soon after the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia in 1918. Alexandra Kollontai, Nadezhda Krupskaia and Inessa Armand established the Zhenotdel in 1919, a government department devoted to establishing a new culture of female expectations. According to historian Barbara Evans Clement, the New Soviet Woman was a Superwoman who took on the burden of multiple roles: Communist citizen, full-time worker, wife, and mother. The Zhenotdel was dissolved in 1930, without having been able to resolve the layered identities expected of this ideal-type Soviet woman.

<text>Pierre Fran√ßois le Courayer (17 November 1681 ‚Äì 17 October 1776) was a French Catholic theological writer, for many years an expatriate in England.

==Life==

Pierre Fran√ßois le Courayer was born at Rouen. While canon regular and librarian of the abbey of St Genevieve at Paris, he conducted a correspondence with Archbishop William Wake on the subject of episcopal succession in England, which supplied him with material for his work, &quot;Dissertation sur la validit√© des ordinations des Anglais et sur la succession des √©v√©ques de l&#x27;Eglise anglicane, avec les preuves justificatives des faits avanc√©s&quot; (&quot;Dissertation on the validity of the Englishmen&#x27;s ordinations and on the episcopal succession in the Anglican Church, with the justificatory proofs of the facts advanced&quot;), published anonymously in 1723 with a fake publication location of Brussels. That work was an attempt to prove that there has been no break in the line of ordination from the apostles to the clergy of the Church of England. 

The following year he wrote to the &quot;Journal des savants&quot; to put his name to the work, though his opinions exposed him to attacks from several theologians, a prosecution and 32 of his propositions being labelled heresies. He was rebuked by Louis Antoine de Noailles, archbishop of Paris then excommunicated by Jean XI Polinier, abbot of Sainte-Genevi√®ve. He still did not recant his opinions but they had gained him supporters in Great Britain and with the help of Francis Atterbury, then in exile in Paris, he took refuge in England and was presented with a doctor&#x27;s degree by the University of Oxford.

In 1732 he accepted that it was impossible to reconcile with his opponents in France and instead settled permanently in London as well as being granted a canonry in Oxford. In 1736 he published a French translation of Paolo Sarpi&#x27;s &quot;History of the Council of Trent&quot;, and dedicated it to Queen Caroline, from whom he received a pension of ¬£200 a year. Besides this he translated Johann Sleidan&#x27;s &quot;History of the Reformation&quot;, and wrote several theological works. In his will, dated two years before his death, he declared himself still a member of the Roman Catholic Church, although dissenting from many of its opinions. He died in London, and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.

<text>Liquid oxygen, sometimes abbreviated as LOX or LOXygen, is a clear cyan liquid form of dioxygen . It was used as the oxidizer in the first liquid-fueled rocket invented in 1926 by Robert H. Goddard, an application which is ongoing.

==Physical properties==
Liquid oxygen has a clear cyan color and is strongly paramagnetic: it can be suspended between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet. Liquid oxygen has a density of , slightly denser than liquid water, and is cryogenic with a freezing point of and a boiling point of at . Liquid oxygen has an expansion ratio of 1:861 and because of this, it is used in some commercial and military aircraft as a transportable source of breathing oxygen.

Because of its cryogenic nature, liquid oxygen can cause the materials it touches to become extremely brittle. Liquid oxygen is also a very powerful oxidizing agent: organic materials will burn rapidly and energetically in liquid oxygen. Further, if soaked in liquid oxygen, some materials such as coal briquettes, carbon black, etc., can detonate unpredictably from sources of ignition such as flames, sparks or impact from light blows. Petrochemicals, including asphalt, often exhibit this behavior.

The tetraoxygen molecule (O4) was predicted in 1924 by Gilbert N. Lewis, who proposed it to explain why liquid oxygen defied Curie&#x27;s law. Modern computer simulations indicate that, although there are no stable O4 molecules in liquid oxygen, O2 molecules do tend to associate in pairs with antiparallel spins, forming transient O4 units.

Liquid nitrogen has a lower boiling point at ‚àí196¬†¬∞C (77¬†K) than oxygen&#x27;s ‚àí183¬†¬∞C (90¬†K), and vessels containing liquid nitrogen can condense oxygen from air: when most of the nitrogen has evaporated from such a vessel, there is a risk that liquid oxygen remaining can react violently with organic material. Conversely, liquid nitrogen or liquid air can be oxygen-enriched by letting it stand in open air; atmospheric oxygen dissolves in it, while nitrogen evaporates preferentially.

The surface tension of liquid oxygen at its normal pressure boiling point is .

==Uses==

In commerce, liquid oxygen is classified as an industrial gas and is widely used for industrial and medical purposes. Liquid oxygen is obtained from the oxygen found naturally in air by fractional distillation in a cryogenic air separation plant.

Air forces have long recognized the strategic importance of liquid oxygen, both as an oxidizer and as a supply of gaseous oxygen for breathing in hospitals and high-altitude aircraft flights. In 1985, the USAF started a program of building its own oxygen-generation facilities at all major consumption bases.

=== In rocket propellant ===
Liquid oxygen is the most common cryogenic liquid oxidizer propellant for spacecraft rocket applications, usually in combination with liquid hydrogen, kerosene or methane.

Liquid oxygen was used in the first liquid fueled rocket. The World War II V-2 missile also used liquid oxygen under the name &quot;A-Stoff&quot; and &quot;Sauerstoff&quot;. In the 1950s, during the Cold War both the United States&#x27; Redstone and Atlas rockets, and the Soviet R-7 Semyorka used liquid oxygen. Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, the ascent stages of the Apollo Saturn rockets, and the Space Shuttle main engines used liquid oxygen.

As of 2024, many active rockets use liquid oxygen:

==History==
*By 1845, Michael Faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist. Six gases, however, resisted every attempt at liquefaction and were known at the time as &quot;permanent gases&quot;. They were oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and nitric oxide.
*In 1877, Louis Paul Cailletet in France and Raoul Pictet in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of liquid air.
*In 1883, Polish professors Zygmunt Wr√≥blewski and Karol Olszewski produced the first measurable quantity of liquid oxygen.

<text>Yeah Yeah Yeahs are an American indie rock band formed in New York City in 2000. The group is composed of vocalist and pianist Karen O (born Karen Lee Orzolek), guitarist and keyboardist Nick Zinner, and drummer Brian Chase. They are complemented in live performances by second guitarist David Pajo (formerly of Slint and Tortoise), who joined as a touring member in 2009 and replaced Imaad Wasif, who had previously held the role. According to a 2004 interview that aired during their appearance on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Live from Central Park SummerStage&quot; series, the band&#x27;s name was taken from modern New York City vernacular.

The band has recorded five studio albums; the first, &quot;Fever to Tell&quot;, was released in 2003. The second, &quot;Show Your Bones&quot;, was released in 2006 and was named the second-best album of the year by &quot;NME&quot;. Their third studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s Blitz!&quot;, was released in March 2009. All three albums earned the band Grammy nominations for Best Alternative Music Album. Their fourth record, &quot;Mosquito&quot;, came out in April 2013. In September 2022, they released &quot;Cool It Down&quot;, and the album was also nominated for a Grammy award.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Fever to Tell&quot; (1990s‚Äì2004)===
Karen O and Brian Chase first met as students at Oberlin College in Ohio in the late 1990s, where Chase was a jazz student at the conservatory. Karen then transferred to New York University and met Zinner, a student at Bard College, in a local bar, where they formed an &quot;instant connection&quot;. During this time, they also shared a loft with future members of the band Metric. Orzolek and Zinner formed an acoustic duo called Unitard but soon decided to &quot;shake things up a bit&quot; by forming a &quot;trashy, punky, grimy&quot; band modeled after the art student, avant-punk bands Karen O was exposed to at Oberlin. After the drummer they initially recruited bowed out, Chase joined the lineup.

The band wrote a slew of songs at their first rehearsal and soon wound up supporting the Strokes and the White Stripes, earning a significant buzz for their arty and garage punk scene. In late 2001, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their self-titled debut EP, which they recorded with Boss Hog&#x27;s Jerry Teel, on their own Shifty label. Early the next year, they stepped into the international spotlight, appearing at SXSW, touring the U.S. with Girls Against Boys, and Europe with Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and headlining their own U.K. tour. Wichita Recordings distributed the group&#x27;s EP in the U.K. and Touch and Go reissued it in the States.

In 2003, the band released their debut album, &quot;Fever to Tell&quot;, which received several strong critical reviews and sold more than 750,000 copies worldwide. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Maps&quot;, received significant airplay on alternative radio. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Maps&quot; as 386th in their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The video for their 2004 single &quot;Y Control&quot; was directed by Spike Jonze. In October 2004, the band released their first DVD, &quot;Tell Me What Rockers to Swallow&quot;. The DVD included a concert filmed at The Fillmore in San Francisco, all of the band&#x27;s music videos to date, and various interviews. Later the same year, they were featured in Scott Crary&#x27;s documentary &quot;Kill Your Idols&quot;.

In November 2009, &quot;NME&quot; rated &quot;Fever to Tell&quot; the fifth-best album of the decade.

===&quot;Show Your Bones&quot;, &quot;Is Is&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Blitz!&quot; (2005‚Äì2009)===
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; second album, &quot;Show Your Bones&quot;, was released on March 28, 2006. Karen O told online zine Drowned in Sound, &quot;&quot;Show Your Bones&quot; is what happens when you put your finger in a light socket&quot;, crediting &quot;9-year old antigenius wonder-kid Drake Barrett for the insight.&quot; The first single from the album, &quot;Gold Lion&quot;, was released on March 20, 2006, reaching number 18 in the Official UK Singles Chart. It has been noted by Leah Greenblatt that &quot;Gold Lion&quot; sounds startlingly similar to &quot;No New Tale To Tell&quot; from 1980s alternative band Love and Rockets.

The band toured throughout Europe and the United States during much of 2006, and also helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival.

In December 2006, the album was named second-best album of the year by &quot;NME&quot; magazine, and &quot;Cheated Hearts&quot; was voted tenth-best song. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named &quot;Show Your Bones&quot; the 44th-best album of 2006, while &quot;Spin&quot; magazine ranked it number 31 on their 40 best albums of 2006.

Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; third EP, titled &quot;Is Is&quot;, was released on July 24, 2007. It includes 5 previously unreleased songs and a short film, which was recorded and filmed at the Glasslands Gallery in Brooklyn, NY. The songs were written in 2004, during the Fever To Tell tour, and performed live often. Three of the five tracks were featured on the &quot;Tell Me What Rockers to Swallow&quot; DVD.

The Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; next album was released in March 2009 and titled &quot;It&#x27;s Blitz!&quot;. The band stated the album sounds different from their previous ones but &quot;still [sounds] like Yeah Yeah Yeahs&quot;. It was originally set to be published on April 13, but following an internet leak on February 22, the band&#x27;s label, Interscope, pulled the release date closer to reduce the leak&#x27;s impact. The album spawned three singles: &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Heads Will Roll&quot;, and &quot;Skeletons&quot;.

&quot;It&#x27;s Blitz!&quot; was named second-best album of 2009 by &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; and third-best by &quot;NME&quot;, along with &quot;Zero&quot; from the album listed as the best track of the year by both.

===&quot;Mosquito&quot; and hiatus (2011‚Äì2016)===
On December 9, 2011, Karen O reported to &quot;NME&quot; that she had been working on new music with the band, hinting a new album was possibly in the making. On January 14, 2013, it was announced via their official Facebook page that the new album would be titled &quot;Mosquito&quot;. It was released on April 16, of the same year. The album features production by TV on the Radio&#x27;s Dave Sitek, Nick Launay, and LCD Soundsystem&#x27;s James Murphy. The first single, &quot;Sacrilege&quot;, was released on February 15, 2013. &quot;Despair&quot; was released as the second single on July 23, 2013.

In December 2014, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs went on hiatus. In 2016, the band received writing credits on the Beyonc√© single &quot;Hold Up&quot;.
===Return, reissue of &quot;Fever to Tell&quot;, and &quot;Cool It Down&quot; (2017‚Äì2022)===
On June 20, 2017, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs announced that they would be headlining the Austin &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; festival on November 10, adding: &quot;Watch for more news coming soon&quot; The Sound on Sound festival was subsequently cancelled.

On May 26, 2018, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs played at All Points Festival in Victoria Park, London.

The Yeah Yeah Yeahs released a deluxe remastering of their debut album &quot;Fever to Tell&quot; on October 20, 2017, through Interscope / UMe. It features previously unreleased demos, B-sides, and other rarities from the era.

In a press release, the band announced, &quot;A friend of a friend kept asking if we were ever gonna put &quot;Fever to Tell&quot; out on vinyl as it hasn&#x27;t been on vinyl in 10 years. That&#x27;s not right. So here it is on vinyl for the first time in 10 years plus a time capsule of photos, demos (1st ever recorded,) a mini film documenting our near downfall and other fun memorabilia, from the turn of the century NYC, made with love + the usual blood, sweat + tears of Yeah Yeah Yeahs.&quot;

To celebrate the reissue, the band performed a small series of shows in October and November at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, California, the Fox Oakland Theatre in Oakland, California, and Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York.

In June 2022, the band announced that they would be releasing the album &quot;Cool It Down&quot; on September 30, making it their first record in nine years. They released the first single, &quot;Spitting Off the Edge of the World&quot;, featuring Perfume Genius, on June 1. On September 29, 2022, the band performed their second single, &quot;Burning&quot;, on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; as part of the show&#x27;s weeklong residency at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

==Musical style==
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; style has been described as &quot;an art-rock trio who made an edgy post-punk, dancefloor-friendly racket that mixed up Blondie, Pretenders, and Siouxsie and the Banshees&quot;.

<doc id="314406" wikidata="Q917403" url="?curid=314406" title="Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia">
<text>Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia () is a 1974 neo-Western film directed by Sam Peckinpah, co-written by Peckinpah and Gordon Dawson from a story by Peckinpah and Frank Kowalski, and starring Warren Oates and Isela Vega, with Robert Webber, Gig Young, Helmut Dantine, Emilio Fern√°ndez and Kris Kristofferson in supporting roles.

Made in Mexico on a low budget after the commercial failure of &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973), &quot;Alfredo Garc√≠a&quot; was, so Peckinpah claimed, the only one of his films released as he had intended. The film was a critical and commercial failure at the time, but has gained a new following and stature in the decades since.

==Plot==
Teresa, the pregnant teenage daughter of a powerful Mexican crime lord known only as , is summoned before her father and interrogated as to the identity of her unborn child&#x27;s father. She then identifies the father as Alfredo Garcia, whom El Jefe had been grooming to be his successor. Infuriated, El Jefe offers a $1 million bounty to whoever will &quot;bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia&quot;.

The search progresses for two months. In Mexico City, a pair of business suit-clad, dispassionate hit men, Sappensly and Quill, enter a saloon and encounter Bennie, a retired U.S. Army officer who makes a meagre living as a piano player and bar manager. The men ask about Garcia, believing they will have more luck getting answers out of a fellow American. Bennie plays dumb, saying the name is familiar but he doesn&#x27;t know who Garcia is.

It turns out that everyone in the bar knows who Garcia is; they simply don&#x27;t know where he is. Bennie goes to meet his girlfriend, Elita, a maid at a ghetto motel. Elita admits to having cheated on Bennie with Garcia, who had professed his love for her, something Bennie refuses to do. Elita tells him that Garcia died in a drunk-driving crash the previous week.

Bennie goes to Sappensly and Quill in the hotel room of the man who hired them, El Jefe&#x27;s business associate Max, and makes a deal for $10,000 for Garcia&#x27;s head, plus a $200 advance for expenses. Bennie convinces Elita to go on a road trip with him to visit Garcia&#x27;s grave, claiming that he only wants proof that Garcia is in fact dead and no longer a threat to their relationship.

Bennie proposes to Elita, promising that their future will soon change and she can retire from her cleaning job. Elita warns Bennie against trying to upset their status quo. While having a picnic, Bennie and Elita are accosted by two bikers who pull guns on the couple. One of the bikers takes Elita aside. He cuts off her shirt, lets her slap him twice, slaps her back, then walks away; she follows and the two kiss. Bennie knocks the second biker unconscious and takes his gun. Finding Elita about to have sex with the first biker, Bennie shoots him dead and then kills the second biker as well.

Bennie confesses to Elita his plan to decapitate Garcia&#x27;s corpse and sell the head for money. A disgusted Elita, still shaken from what has just happened, begs Bennie to give up this quest and return to Mexico City. Bennie again refuses, although he agrees to marry Elita in the church of the town where Garcia is buried. They find Garcia&#x27;s grave, but when he opens the coffin, Bennie is struck from behind by an unseen assailant and knocked unconscious. He wakes up to find himself half-buried in the grave, and Elita is dead. Garcia&#x27;s corpse has been decapitated.

Bennie learns from villagers that his assailants are driving a station wagon. He catches up with the men after they blow out a tire. Bennie shoots them, searches their car, and claims Garcia&#x27;s head. Stopping at a roadside restaurant, he packs the sack containing the head with ice to preserve it for the journey home. Bennie talks to the head as if Garcia were still alive, first blaming Alfredo for Elita&#x27;s death and then conceding that both of them probably loved her equally.

Bennie is ambushed by members of Garcia&#x27;s family. They reclaim the head and are about to kill Bennie when they are interrupted by the arrival of Sappensly and Quill. The hit men pretend to ask for directions. Quill produces a sub-machine gun and murders most of the family, but is fatally shot by one of them. As Sappensly sorrowfully looks at Quill&#x27;s corpse, Bennie asks: &quot;Do I get paid?&quot; Sappensly turns to shoot, but Bennie kills him. Bennie returns to Mexico City, &quot;arguing&quot; with Garcia&#x27;s head all the while.

At his apartment Bennie gives Garcia&#x27;s head a shower and then brings it to Max&#x27;s hotel room. Feigning willingness to surrender the head for his $10,000, Bennie reveals he is no longer motivated by money; he says Alfredo was a friend of his and demands to know why Max and the others want his head so badly. He also blames Elita&#x27;s death on the bounty. Incensed, Bennie starts shooting, killing Max and his henchmen in a short gun battle. He takes a business card from the desk with El Jefe&#x27;s address on it.

After attending the baptism for his new grandchild, El Jefe greets Bennie as a hero in his hacienda, and gives him a briefcase containing the million-dollar bounty. Bennie calmly relates how many people died for Garcia&#x27;s head, including his beloved. El Jefe tells Bennie to take his money and throw the head to the pigs on the way out. Infuriated that the object responsible for Elita&#x27;s death is viewed as nothing more than garbage, Bennie guns down all of El Jefe&#x27;s bodyguards.

Teresa enters with her newborn son, causing Bennie to hesitate shooting El Jefe. She urges Bennie to kill her father. Bennie obliges and leaves El Jefe&#x27;s hacienda with Teresa, taking along Garcia&#x27;s head. They approach the entrance gate and Bennie says goodbye to Teresa, departing the scene with the words: &quot;You take care of the boy. And I&#x27;ll take care of the father&quot;. Bennie drives away, only to be killed by El Jefe&#x27;s men, their machine guns tearing him to pieces.

==Development==
Director Sam Peckinpah was working on &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot; when screenwriter and long-time friend Frank Kowalski told him an idea for a film: &quot;I got a great title: ‚Ä≥&quot;Bring Me the Head of&quot;...,&#x27; - and he had some other name - &#x27;and the hook is that the guy is already dead&#x27;.&quot; Peckinpah loved it, and began writing on it then and also in England while making &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;. He went on to write the shooting screenplay with Gordon Dawson. Producer Martin Baum had formed his own independent production company, Optimus Productions, and had a deal with United Artists. Peckinpah approached him with 25 pages of the film&#x27;s script. Baum read it and liked it. United Artists agreed to pay Peckinpah to write the script but he told Baum that he did not want any money for it because he owed him one. Peckinpah told Baum that if United Artists liked the script then they could pay him.

Peckinpah started pre-production in mid-August 1973 in Mexico City. With the exception of a few key people, the crew was entirely Mexicans. He hired director of photography Alex Phillips, Jr., one of Mexico&#x27;s premiere cameramen. They bonded over a dislike for wide-angle lenses, an admiration for zooms and multiple camera setups. Peckinpah told him, &quot;I make very few takes, but I shoot a lot of film because I like to change angles. I shoot with editing in the back of my mind&quot;. While scouting locations, he relied extensively on his gut instinct and desire to portray a gritty, realistic vision he had of Mexico. He spent a lot of time searching for the right bar that would be Bennie&#x27;s workplace. Peckinpah finally discovered a place in the Plaza Garibaldi known as &quot;Tlaque-Paque&quot;. He looked around and said, &quot;this is dressed. This is for real&quot;. Mexican members of the crew told him that the bar&#x27;s owner had an infamous reputation and it was rumored that he once killed a woman there, serving very little jail time because he bribed the right people in positions of power.

&quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; went into production in late September 1973, and Peckinpah was quoted in an October issue of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine as saying, &quot;For me, Hollywood no longer exists. It&#x27;s past history. I&#x27;ve decided to stay in Mexico because I believe I can make my pictures with greater freedom from here&quot;. This upset the Motion Picture and Television Unions and they openly censured the director for his statement at their National Conference in Detroit. They also threatened &quot;Alfredo Garcia&quot; with union boycotts upon its release, labeling it a &quot;runaway&quot; production. In his defense, Peckinpah claimed that he was misquoted. Before the film was to be released, the unions relented on their boycott threat.

As principal photography continued into the month of December, the demands‚Äîboth physical and mental‚Äîwere taking their toll on the cast and crew. To help relieve the tension, Peckinpah and the producers bought out a local bar and threw a surprise party. Principal photography ended three days before Christmas, and the director took a week off before supervising the editing of the film.

==Reception==
On its release in 1974, &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garc√≠a&quot; was savaged by many critics and bombed at the box office. Nora Sayre of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film started off well but &quot;disentegrates rapidly,&quot; explaining: &quot;Without Garcia as a victim, the plot has almost nowhere to go. Therefore, random episodes are slung into the narrative, including one of the silliest near-rape scenes I&#x27;ve ever seen ... But even this gratuitous garbage can&#x27;t prevent the movie from dragging.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film as &quot;turgid melodrama at its worst ... Considering the vast carnage, it is a measure of the film&#x27;s nothing impact that the bloodletting fails to stir much emotional reaction.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated, &quot;For all the violence, the movie is a very, very long two hours. The bodies shot at close quarters crumple in slow motion, but the motion is slow even when it isn&#x27;t.&quot; Michael Sragow of &quot;New York&quot; magazine called it &quot;a catastrophe so huge that those who once ranked Peckinpah with Hemingway may now invoke Mickey Spillane&quot;. John Simon called &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; &quot;a all-out preposterous horror horror, except for a fine performance by Isela Vega and the clever way in which the protagonist is sneaked into our consciousness&quot;.

Conversely, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded his highest grade of four stars and called it &quot;some kind of bizarre masterpiece,&quot; concluding that &quot;&#x27;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&#x27; is Sam Peckinpah making movies flat out, giving us a desperate character he clearly loves, and asking us to somehow see past the horror and the blood to the sad poem he&#x27;s trying to write about the human condition.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that although Peckinpah&#x27;s films were noted for their violence, &quot;What Peckinpah does much better, and what distinguishes his film &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot; as his best work, is to portray a lyrical mood between society&#x27;s outcasts. A hooker and a prospector hook up in &#x27;Cable Hogue,&#x27; the pairing of Bennie and Elita in &#x27;Alfredo Garcia&#x27; is equally affecting. Peckinpah is also effective in portraying present-day Mexico as a place of wild contrasts; seedy bars and modern airports, peasants in rags and streamlined tour buses.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared, &quot;For better and worse, no other filmmaker on earth could have conjured up this strange, obsessive, uniquely flawed yet uniquely fascinating picture.&quot; Tom Milne of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;The hints of Gothic horror and romantic tenderness fitfully apparent in Peckinpah&#x27;s earlier work here bloom in superb union.&quot;

&quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; was listed in the 1978 book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;.

Despite the film&#x27;s harsh reception at the time of release, it has since found a contemporary audience, maintaining a 78% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.3/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; adds a quirky -- but still thoroughly entertaining -- outlier to Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s pulpy filmography.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Films===
In the comedy film &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985), Chevy Chase (after fainting in an operating room) asks a nurse, &quot;do you have the Beatles&#x27; White Album? Never mind, just get me a cup of hot fat. And bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia while you&#x27;re out there.&quot; In his 1993 stand-up special &quot;No Cure for Cancer&quot;, Denis Leary says the line &quot;Here&#x27;s ten bucks, bring me the head of Barry Manilow&quot;. In the film &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (1993), the police officer played by Benjamin Bratt is called Alfredo Garcia in reference to the film.

Jim Reardon&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Bring Me the Head of Charlie Brown&quot; (1986) parodies both the title and Peckinpah&#x27;s violent slow-motion style. Similarly, the made-for-TV movie &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1988), reuniting the cast of the 1960s television sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, is titled as such in reference to this film.

Cinematographer Roger Deakins cited &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; as a visual inspiration for &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, among other Peckinpah films.

===Literature===
In the &quot;Sandman Slim&quot; series of novels by the author Richard Kadrey, protagonist Stark gives his reluctant sidekick, a severed but still-alive head, the nickname &quot;Alfredo Garcia&quot; and makes many references to the character throughout the series.

A collection of Dilbert cartoons by Scott Adams is titled ‚ÄúBring Me the Head of Willy the Mailboy.‚Äù

A humorous fantasy novel Bring Me the Head of Prince Charming perhaps got the title from this movie as well.

===Music===
English space rock band Hawkwind released a 1985 live album entitled &quot;Bring Me the Head of Yuri Gagarin&quot;, referencing both the film and the famed Soviet cosmonaut.

Iron Prostate released a 7&quot; single on Vital Music Records, &quot;Bring Me the Head of Jerry Garcia&quot; (1991). The song was also intended for inclusion on their second album, produced by Jim Steinman. But the band &quot;dissolved in the midst of rancorous sessions with, of all people, Meat Loaf producer Jim Steinman&quot;. The demo of &quot;Jerry Garcia&quot; is available through guitarist George Tabb&#x27;s website.

The Flaming Stars named one of their compilation albums &quot;Bring Me the Rest of Alfredo Garcia&quot; in 1997.

Industrial rock band Chemlab sampled a shootout scene from the movie on their 1998 album &quot;East Side Militia&quot; via the opening track &quot;Exile on Mainline&quot;.

===Radio===
In the &quot;Film Club&quot; round of the popular long-running BBC Radio 4 panel comedy &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t A Clue&quot;, regular reference is made to this film‚Äîusually by Graeme Garden‚Äîwith one or more words changed to satisfy that week&#x27;s theme of comedy film titles.

===Television===

A 1981 Episode of The Incredible Hulk was titled &quot;Bring Me The Head of the Hulk&quot;.

&quot;Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment&quot; was a British comedy panel game which ran on Channel 5 between 1999 and 2003.

In &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; episode 115 &quot;Welcome to the Doll House&quot; (2005), Rory says, &quot;You did it. You brought me the head of Alfredo Garcia&quot;, in reference to the film.

In &quot;House&quot; episode 78 &quot;You Don‚Äôt Want to Know&quot; (2007), House issues the contest objective: to &quot;bring me the thong of Lisa Cuddy&quot;.

In &quot;Futurama&quot; episode 113 &quot;Overclockwise&quot; (2011), Mom tells the Hoverfish &quot;Bring me the clock of Bender Rodriguez&quot; in reference to the film.

&quot;Kaijudo&quot; episode 42 &quot;Bring Me the Head of Tatsurion the Unchained&quot; (2013) is a reference to the title of this film.

&quot;Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja&quot; season 1 episode 23b &quot;Bring Me the Head of Ranginald Bagel!&quot; (2014) references and parodies the title and plot of the film.

In &quot;True Detective‚Äôs&quot; season 2 finale (&quot;Omega Station&quot;, 2015), a scene in a set photographer&#x27;s home features a poster for the movie.

&quot;&quot; episode 22 &quot;Bring Me the Spark of Optimus Prime&quot; (2019) references the title of this film.

<doc id="314407" wikidata="Q1148249" url="?curid=314407" title="H.261">
<text>H.261 is an ITU-T video compression standard, first ratified in November 1988. It is the first member of the H.26x family of video coding standards in the domain of the ITU-T Study Group 16 Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG, then Specialists Group on Coding for Visual Telephony). It was the first video coding standard that was useful in practical terms.

H.261 was originally designed for transmission over ISDN lines on which data rates are multiples of 64¬†kbit/s. The coding algorithm was designed to be able to operate at video bit rates between 40¬†kbit/s and 2¬†Mbit/s. The standard supports two video frame sizes: CIF (352√ó288 luma with 176√ó144 chroma) and QCIF (176√ó144 with 88√ó72 chroma) using a 4:2:0 sampling scheme. It also has a backward-compatible trick for sending still images with 704√ó576 luma resolution and 352√ó288 chroma resolution (which was added in a later revision in 1993).

== History ==
The first digital video coding standard was H.120, created by the CCITT (now ITU-T) in 1984. H.120 was not usable in practice, as its performance was too poor. H.120 was based on differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM), which had inefficient compression. During the late 1980s, a number of companies began experimenting with the much more efficient DCT compression for video coding, with the CCITT receiving 14 proposals for DCT-based video compression formats, in contrast to a single proposal based on vector quantization (VQ) compression. The H.261 standard was subsequently developed based on DCT compression.

H.261 was developed by the CCITT Study Group XV Specialists Group on Coding for Visual Telephony (which later became part of ITU-T SG16), chaired by Sakae Okubo of NTT. Since H.261, DCT compression has been adopted by all the major video coding standards that followed.

Whilst H.261 was preceded in 1984 by H.120 (which also underwent a revision in 1988 of some historic importance) as a digital video coding standard, H.261 was the first truly practical digital video coding standard (in terms of product support in significant quantities). In fact, all subsequent international video coding standards (MPEG-1 Part 2, H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2, H.263, MPEG-4 Part 2, H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10, and HEVC) have been based closely on the H.261 design. Additionally, the methods used by the H.261 development committee to collaboratively develop the standard have remained the basic operating process for subsequent standardization work in the field.

Although H.261 was first approved as a standard in 1988, the first version was missing some significant elements necessary to make it a complete interoperability specification. Various parts of it were marked as &quot;Under Study&quot;. It was later revised in 1990 to add the remaining necessary aspects, and was then revised again in 1993. The 1993 revision added an Annex D entitled &quot;Still image transmission&quot;, which provided a backward-compatible way to send still images with 704√ó576 luma resolution and 352√ó288 chroma resolution by using a staggered 2:1 subsampling horizontally and vertically to separate the picture into four sub-pictures that were sent sequentially.

== H.261 design ==

The basic processing unit of the design is called a macroblock, and H.261 was the first standard in which the macroblock concept appeared. Each macroblock consists of a 16√ó16 array of luma samples and two corresponding 8√ó8 arrays of chroma samples, using 4:2:0 sampling and a YCbCr color space. The coding algorithm uses a hybrid of motion-compensated inter-picture prediction and spatial transform coding with scalar quantization, zig-zag scanning and entropy encoding.

The inter-picture prediction reduces temporal redundancy, with motion vectors used to compensate for motion. Whilst only integer-valued motion vectors are supported in H.261, a blurring filter can be applied to the prediction signal ‚Äì partially mitigating the lack of fractional-sample motion vector precision. Transform coding using an 8√ó8 discrete cosine transform (DCT) reduces the spatial redundancy. The DCT that is widely used in this regard was introduced by N. Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974. Scalar quantization is then applied to round the transform coefficients to the appropriate precision determined by a step size control parameter, and the quantized transform coefficients are zig-zag scanned and entropy-coded (using a &quot;run-level&quot; variable-length code) to remove statistical redundancy.

The H.261 standard actually only specifies how to decode the video. Encoder designers were left free to design their own encoding algorithms (such as their own motion estimation algorithms), as long as their output was constrained properly to allow it to be decoded by any decoder made according to the standard. Encoders are also left free to perform any pre-processing they want to their input video, and decoders are allowed to perform any post-processing they want to their decoded video prior to display. One effective post-processing technique that became a key element of the best H.261-based systems is called deblocking filtering. This reduces the appearance of block-shaped artifacts caused by the block-based motion compensation and spatial transform parts of the design. Indeed, blocking artifacts are probably a familiar phenomenon to almost everyone who has watched digital video. Deblocking filtering has since become an integral part of the more recent standards H.264 and HEVC (although even when using these newer standards, additional post-processing is still allowed and can enhance visual quality if performed well).

Design refinements introduced in later standardization efforts have resulted in significant improvements in compression capability relative to the H.261 design. This has resulted in H.261 becoming essentially obsolete, although it is still used as a backward-compatibility mode in some video-conferencing systems (such as H.323) and for some types of internet video. However, H.261 remains a major historical milestone in the field of video coding development.

==Software implementations==
The LGPL-licensed libavcodec includes a H.261 encoder and decoder. It is supported by the free VLC media player and MPlayer multimedia players, and in ffdshow and FFmpeg decoders projects.

<doc id="314409" wikidata="Q3088597" url="?curid=314409" title="NEXRAD">
<text>NEXRAD or Nexrad (Next-Generation Radar) is a network of 159 high-resolution S-band Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the United States Department of Commerce, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within the Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Air Force within the Department of Defense. Its technical name is WSR-88D (&quot;Weather Surveillance Radar, 1988, Doppler&quot;).

NEXRAD detects precipitation and atmospheric movement or wind. It returns data which when processed can be displayed in a mosaic map which shows patterns of precipitation and its movement. The radar system operates in two basic modes, selectable by the operator ‚Äì a slow-scanning &quot;clear-air mode&quot; for analyzing air movements when there is little or no activity in the area, and a &quot;precipitation mode&quot;, with a faster scan for tracking active weather. NEXRAD has an increased emphasis on automation, including the use of algorithms and automated volume scans.

==Deployment==

In the 1970s, the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Defense, and Transportation, agreed that to better serve their operational needs, the existing national radar network needed to be replaced. The radar network consisted of WSR-57 developed in 1957, and WSR-74 developed in 1974. Neither system employed Doppler technology, which provides wind speed and direction information.

The Joint Doppler Operational Project (JDOP) was formed in 1976 at the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) to study the usefulness of using Doppler weather radar to identify severe and tornadic thunderstorms. Tests over the next three years, conducted by the National Weather Service and the Air Weather Service agency of the U.S. Air Force, found that Doppler radar provided much improved early detection of severe thunderstorms. A working group that included the JDOP published a paper providing the concepts for the development and operation of a national weather radar network. In 1979, the NEXRAD Joint System Program Office (JSPO) was formed to move forward with the development and deployment of the proposed NEXRAD radar network. That year, the NSSL completed a formal report on developing the NEXRAD system.

When the proposal was presented to the Reagan administration, two options were considered to build the radar systems: allow corporate bids to build the systems based on the schematics of the previously developed prototype radar or seek contractors to build their own systems using predetermined specifications. The JSPO group opted to select a contractor to develop and produce the radars that would be used for the national network. Radar systems developed by Raytheon and Unisys were tested during the 1980s. However, it took four years to allow the prospective contractors to develop their proprietary models. Unisys was selected as the contractor, and was awarded a full-scale production contract in January 1990.
Installation of an operational prototype was completed in the fall of 1990 in Norman, Oklahoma. The first installation of a WSR-88D for operational use in daily forecasting was in Sterling, Virginia on June 12, 1992. The last system deployed as part of the installation program was installed in North Webster, Indiana on August 30, 1997. In 2011, the new Langley Hill NEXRAD was added at Langley Hill, Washington to better cover the Pacific Coast of that area; other radars also filled gaps in coverage at Evansville, Indiana and Ft. Smith, Arkansas, following the initial installations. The site locations were strategically chosen to provide overlapping coverage between radars in case one failed during a severe weather event. Where possible, they were co-located with NWS Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) to permit quicker access by maintenance technicians.

The NEXRAD radars incorporated a number of improvements over the radar systems that were previously in use. The new system provided Doppler velocity, improving tornado prediction ability by detecting rotation present within the storm at different scan angles. It provided improved resolution and sensitivity, enabling operators to see features such as cold fronts, thunderstorm gust fronts, and mesoscale to even storm scale features of thunderstorms that had never been visible on radar. The NEXRAD radars also provided volumetric scans of the atmosphere allowing operators to examine the vertical structure of storms and could act as wind profilers by providing detailed wind information for several kilometers above the radar site. The radars also had a much increased range allowing detection of weather events at much greater distances from the radar site.

WSR-88D development, maintenance, and training are coordinated by the NEXRAD Radar Operations Center (ROC) located on the grounds of the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport (KOUN) in Norman, Oklahoma.

The University of Louisiana at Monroe in Monroe, Louisiana operates a &quot;WSR-88D clone&quot; radar that is used by local National Weather Service offices in Shreveport, Little Rock and Jackson to fill gaps in NEXRAD coverage in northeastern Louisiana, southeastern Arkansas and western Mississippi. However, the radar&#x27;s status as being part of the NEXRAD network is disputed.

==Radar properties==
A standard WSR-88D operates in the S band, at a frequency of around 2800¬†MHz, with a typical gain around 53¬†dB using a center-fed parabolic antenna. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) varies from 318 to 1300¬†Hz with a maximum power output of 700¬†kW at Klystron output, although dependent on the volume coverage pattern (VCP) selected by the operator. All NEXRADs have a dish diameter of 9.1¬†m (30¬†ft) and an aperture diameter of 8.5¬†m (28¬†ft). Using the predetermined VCPs, NEXRADs have a traditional elevation minimum and maximum ranging from 0.1 to 19.5 degrees, although the non-operational minimum and maximum spans from ‚àí1 to +45 degrees. Unlike its predecessor, the WSR-74, the antenna can not be manually steered by the operator. WSR-88D Level I data is the recorded output of the digital receiver. Spatial resolution varies with data type and scan angle ‚Äì level III data has a resolution of 1¬†km x 1 degree in azimuth, while super-res level II, (implemented in 2008 nationwide), has a resolution of 250m by 0.5 degrees in azimuth below 2.4 degrees in elevation.

==Scan strategies==
The NEXRAD radar system continually refreshes its three-dimensional database via one of several predetermined scan patterns. These patterns have differing PRFs to fit the respective use, but all have a constant resolution. Since the system samples the atmosphere in three dimensions, there are many variables that can be changed, depending on the desired output. With all traditional VCPs, the antenna scans at a maximum of 19.5 degrees in elevation, and a minimum of .5, with some coastal sites scanning as low as .2 or lower. Due to the incomplete elevation coverage, a phenomenon known as &quot;The Cone of Silence&quot; is present with all NEXRAD radars. The term describes the lack of coverage directly above the radar sites.

There are currently seven Volume Coverage Patterns (VCP) available to NWS meteorologists, with an eighth in the process of replacing one of the existing seven. Each VCP is a predefined set of instructions that control antenna rotation speed, elevation angle, transmitter pulse repetition frequency and pulse width. The radar operator chooses from the VCPs based on the type of weather occurring:

* Clear Air or Light Precipitation: VCP 31, 32, and 35
* Shallow Precipitation: VCP 35, 112, and 215
* Non-Tropical Convection: VCP 12, 212, and 215
* Tropical System Convection: VCP 212, 215, 112, and 121

The specific VCP currently in use at each NEXRAD site is available.

==Enhancements==

===Super resolution===
Deployed from March to August 2008 with all level II data, the Super Resolution upgrade permitted the capability of the radar to produce much higher resolution data. Under legacy resolution, the WSR-88D provides reflectivity data at by 1 degree to range, and velocity data at by 1 degree to a range of . Super Resolution provides reflectivity data with a sample size of by 0.5 degree, and increase the range of Doppler velocity data to . Initially, the increased resolution is only available in the lower scan elevations. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution.

The improvement in azimuthal resolution increases the range at which tornadic mesoscale rotations can be detected. This allows for faster lead time on warnings and extends the useful range of the radar. The increased resolution (in both azimuth and range) increases the detail of such rotations, giving a more accurate representation of the storm. Along with providing better detail of detected precipitation and other mesoscale features, Super Resolution also provides additional detail to aid in other severe storm analysis. Super Resolution extends the range of velocity data and provides it faster than before, also allowing for faster lead time on potential tornado detection and subsequent warnings.

===Dual polarization===

WSR-88D sites across the nation have been upgraded to polarimetric radar, which adds a vertical polarization to the traditional horizontally polarized radar waves, in order to more accurately discern what is reflecting the signal. This so-called dual polarization allows the radar to distinguish between rain, hail, and snow, something the horizontally polarized radars cannot accurately do. Early trials showed that rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, birds, insects, and ground clutter all have different signatures with dual polarization, which could mark a significant improvement in forecasting winter storms and severe thunderstorms. The deployment of the dual polarization capability (Build 12) to NEXRAD sites began in 2010 and was completed by the summer of 2013. The radar at Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Oklahoma was the first operational WSR-88D modified to utilize dual polarization technology. The modified radar went into operation on March 3, 2011.

=== AVSET ===
When the NEXRAD system was initially implemented, the radar automatically scanned all scan angles in a Volume Coverage Pattern, even if the highest scan angles were free of precipitation. As a result, in many cases when severe weather was farther from the radar site, forecasters could not provide as timely severe weather warnings as possible. The Automated Volume Scan Evaluation and Termination (AVSET) algorithm helps solve this problem by immediately ending the volume scan when precipitation returns at higher scan angles drop below a set threshold (around 20 dBZ). This can often allow for more volume scans per hour, improving severe weather detection without the need for hardware upgrades AVSET was initially deployed in RPG build 12.3, in Fall of 2011.

===SAILS and MESO-SAILS===

One of the primary weaknesses of the WSR-88D radar system was the lack of frequency of base (0.5 degree) scans, especially during severe weather. Forecasters, and TV viewers at home, often had access to images that were four or five minutes old, and therefore had inaccurate information. TV viewers at home could be lulled into a false sense of security that a tornado was farther away from them than it really was, endangering residents in the storm&#x27;s path. The Supplemental Adaptive Intra-Volume Low-Level Scan (SAILS) technique, deployed with Build 14 in the first half of 2014, allows operators the option to run an additional base scan during the middle of a typical volume scan. With one SAILS cut active on VCP 212, base scans occur about once every two and a half minutes, with more frequent updates if AVSET terminates the volume scan early.

Multiple Elevation Scan Option for Supplemental Adaptive Intra-Volume Low-Level Scan (MESO-SAILS) is an enhancement to SAILS, which allows the radar operator to run one, two or three additional base scans during the course of a volume scan, per the operators request. During June 2013, the Radar Operations Center first tested SAILSx2, which adds two additional low-level scans per volume. It was executed for approximately 4.5 hours and during the testing, an Electronics Technician observed the pedestal/antenna assembly&#x27;s behavior. No excessive wear was noted. Two days later, SAILSx3 was executed, which added 3 additional low-level scans to a volume. During this 1.5 hour test of SAILSx3, a ROC Radar Hardware Engineer accompanied the ROC Electronics Technician to observe the antenna/pedestal assembly. Again, no excessive wear was noted. MESO-SAILS was deployed with Build 16.1, in spring of 2016.

=== MRLE ===
Mid-Volume Rescan of Low-Level Elevations (colloquially known as MRLE) is a dynamic scanning option for the WSR-88D derived from MESO-SAILS, a separate scanning option implemented in NEXRAD RPG 14.0, in the Spring of 2014.

During quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS), colloquially known as squall lines, the detection of mesovortices, which generate at 4,000 to 8,000 feet above ground level, is not always possible with SAILS cuts, as the base 0.5 degree scan travels below the formation of mesovortices at closer distances to the radar. MRLE consecutively scans either the two, three or four lowest scan angles during the middle of a typical volume scan, allowing more frequent surveillance of mesovortex formation during QLCS events. MRLE will be deployed on a non-operational basis in RPG 18.0 in spring of 2018, with possible operational deployment with RPG 19.0, if proven useful or of importance.

Deployment was anticipated by the Radar Operations Center to commence in October 2017, along with the RPG 18.0 build, on a non-operational basis. The scanning option will only be available for use with Volume Coverage Patterns 21, 12, 212, and additionally 215. If proven to be significant in terms of warning dissemination, MRLE will deploy operationally nationwide with RPG 18.0, planned for 2018.

====Concept====

The concept of MRLE derives from the need of more frequent low-level scans during quasi-linear convective systems (QLCSs). During QLCSs, it is not uncommon for brief and otherwise un-noticeable mesovortices to spawn at points along the line. Due to untimely radar data and time being taken to complete the entire volume, these vortices often spawn without warning or prior notice. With MRLE, the operator has the choice between 2 and 4 low-level scans. Unlike MESO-SAILS, which scans at one angle and can only do up to 3 low-level scans per volume, MRLE scans at 4 possible angles, and can cut into a volume up to 4 times, depending on the operators choice. The angles are as follows, alongside their respective scan frequencies:

*MRLEx2 = 0.5¬∞ and 0.9¬∞ elevations
*MRLEx3 = 0.5¬∞, 0.9¬∞ and 1.3¬∞ elevations
*MRLEx4 = 0.5¬∞, 0.9¬∞, 1.3¬∞ and 1.8¬∞ elevations
The operator can not use MESO-SAILS alongside MRLE simultaneously. If one is selected while the other is active, the NEXRAD algorithms will automatically set the other &quot;off&quot;.

=== Service Life Extension Program ===
Started on March 13, 2013, the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), is an extensive effort to keep and maintain the current NEXRAD network in working order for as long as possible. These improvements include signal processor upgrades, pedestal upgrades, transmitter upgrades, and shelter upgrades. The program is anticipated to be finished by 2022, which coincides with the beginnings of a nationwide implementation of multi-function phased array radars (see below).

==Coverage gaps==

WSR-88D has coverage gaps below 10,000 feet (or no coverage at all) in many parts of the continental United States, often for terrain or budgetary reasons, or remoteness of the area. Such notable gaps include most of Alaska; several areas of Oregon, including the central and southern coast and much of the area east of the Cascade Mountains; many portions of the Rocky Mountains; Pierre, South Dakota; portions of northern Texas; large portions of the Nebraska panhandle; the Four Corners region; the area around the Northwest Angle in Minnesota; an area near the Connecticut River in Vermont; and areas near the borders of the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles. Notably, many of these gaps lie in tornado alley. At least one tornado has gone undetected by WSR-88D as a result of such a coverage gap ‚Äì an EF1 tornado in Lovelady, Texas in April 2014. As a result of the coverage gap, initial reports of tornadic activity were treated with skepticism by the local National Weather Service forecast office.

Coverage gaps can also be caused during radar outages, especially in areas with little to no overlapping coverage. For example, a hardware failure on July 16, 2013 resulted in an outage and coverage gap for the Albany, New York area that lasted through early August.

A coverage gap in North Carolina encouraged Senator Richard Burr to propose S. 2058, also known as the Metropolitan Weather Hazard Protection Act of 2015. The act mandates that any city with a population of 700,000 or more must have Doppler Radar coverage &lt;6,000¬†feet above ground level. The bill passed the Senate, but died in a House committee.

It is not likely that additional WSR-88Ds will be deployed, as the production line was shut down in 1997, and the National Weather Service has an insufficient budget to restart production. In 2011, a known coverage gap was filled when the Langley Hill radar in southwestern Washington was installed, using the last remaining spare. This radar opportunity was spearheaded by a public campaign led by Professor Cliff Mass at the University of Washington, and likely helped the NWS office in Portland, Oregon issue a timely warning for the Manzanita, OR EF-2 tornado in October, 2016.

In 2021, the National Weather Service office in Slidell, Louisiana announced that they would move the office&#x27;s NEXRAD from the office building in Slidell west to Hammond at the end of 2022. Along with a lower elevation angle, the new location would enable lower level monitoring of storm activity in the Baton Rouge area, where the lowest sampling elevation would drop from 4000-6000 feet above the surface to 300-600 feet.

=== Destroyed radars ===
The NEXRAD site located in Cayey, Puerto Rico was destroyed during the passage of Hurricane Maria through the region in September 2017. In addition to a neighboring Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) site that was rendered temporarily inoperable but ultimately survived, the Department of Defense deployed two short-range X-band radars on the island to provide radar coverage until the FAA-maintained NEXRAD site was restored. In June 2018, this NEXRAD radar site was restored to fully operational condition and was reinforced with several lightning rods and secured with a stronger fiberglass dome that included using more than 3,000 bolts.

On August 27, 2020, the NEXRAD radar site located in Lake Charles, Louisiana, was destroyed by Hurricane Laura as the eye of the Category 4 storm‚Äîwhich packed wind gusts recorded around in the city‚Äîpassed over the site after it made landfall. NEXRAD radars based in Houston, Shreveport and Fort Polk were used to fill gaps in radar coverage within portions of Southwestern Louisiana until the Lake Charles site was rebuilt; the NWS Radar Operations Center also deployed a SMART-R vehicle on loan from the University of Oklahoma to provide supplemental radar data on Hurricane Delta in advance of its track into the region (nearly paralleling that of Hurricane Laura) in late October. Operational service to the Lake Charles NEXRAD radar site was restored in January 2021, following a four-month, $1.65-million reconstruction project that included the replacement of the radome and internal equipment and repairs to the station&#x27;s radome pedestal, tower, fence and equipment shelters.

On May 24, 2023, the NEXRAD radar site located on Guam, was damaged by Typhoon Mawar as the eye of the Category 4 typhoon passed over the northern end of the island. After initially being restored back into operation, the installation suffered from ongoing issues and, as of April 24, 2024, has been reported as &quot;unserviceable&quot; in NOTAMs. Future plans for restoring weather radar to Guam and the CNMI are unknown.

==Future enhancements==

=== Current NEXRAD system ===
The National Weather Service keeps a list of upcoming improvements to the WSR-88D system.

===Multi-function Phased Array Radar (MPAR)===
Beyond dual-polarization, the advent of phased array radar will probably be the next major improvement in severe weather detection. Its ability to rapidly scan large areas would give an enormous advantage to radar meteorologists. Its additional ability to track both known and unknown aircraft in three dimensions would allow a phased array network to simultaneously replace the current Air Route Surveillance Radar network, saving the United States government billions of dollars in maintenance costs. The National Severe Storms Laboratory predicts that a phased array system will eventually replace the current network of WSR-88D radar transmitters.

==Applications==

===Usage===
NEXRAD data is used in multiple ways. It is used by National Weather Service meteorologists and (under provisions of U.S. law) is freely available to users outside of the NWS, including researchers, media, and private citizens. The primary goal of NEXRAD data is to aid NWS meteorologists in operational forecasting. The data allows them to accurately track precipitation and anticipate its development and track. More importantly, it allows the meteorologists to track and anticipate severe weather and tornadoes. Combined with ground reports, tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings can be issued to alert the public about dangerous storms. NEXRAD data also provides information about rainfall rate and aids in hydrological forecasting. Data is provided to the public in several forms, the most basic form being graphics published to the NWS website. Data is also available in two similar, but different, raw formats. Available directly from the NWS is Level III data, consisting of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth base products as well as many derived, post-processed products; Level II data consists of only the base products, but at their original resolution. Because of the higher bandwidth costs, Level II data is not available directly from the NWS. The NWS distributes this data freely to Amazon Web Services and several top-tier universities, which in turn distribute the data to private organizations.

<doc id="314412" wikidata="Q3311247" url="?curid=314412" title="Form of the Good">
<text>The Form of the Good, or more literally translated &quot;the Idea of the Good&quot; (), is a concept in the philosophy of Plato. In Plato&#x27;s Theory of Forms, in which Forms are defined as perfect, eternal, and changeless concepts existing outside space and time, the Form of the Good is the mysterious highest Form and the source of all the other Forms.

==Uses in &quot;The Republic&quot;==
The first references that are seen in &quot;The Republic&quot; to the Form of the Good are within the conversation between Glaucon and Socrates (454 c‚Äìd). When he is trying to answer such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of justice, Plato identifies that we should not &quot;introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature&quot; instead we must focus on &quot;the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves&quot; which is the form of the Good. This form is the basis for understanding all other forms; it is what allows us to understand everything else. Through the conversation between Socrates and Glaucon (508 a‚Äìc), Plato analogizes the form of the Good with the sun as it is what allows us to see things. Here, Plato describes how the sun allows for sight. But he makes a very important distinction, &quot;sun is not sight&quot; but it is &quot;the cause of sight itself.&quot; As the sun is in the visible realm, the form of Good is in the intelligible realm. It is &quot;what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower&quot;. It is not only the &quot;cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge&quot;.
Plato identifies how the form of the Good allows for the cognizance to understand such difficult concepts as justice. He identifies knowledge and truth as important, but through Socrates (508d‚Äìe) says, &quot;good is yet more prized&quot;. He then proceeds to explain &quot;although the good is not being&quot; it is &quot;superior to it in rank and power&quot;, it is what &quot;provides for knowledge and truth&quot; (508e).

==Scholarly analysis==
Plato writes that the Form (or Idea) of the Good is the origin of knowledge although it is not knowledge itself, and from the Good, things that are just and true, gain their usefulness and value. Humans are compelled to pursue the good, but no one can hope to do this successfully without philosophical reasoning. According to Plato, true knowledge is conversant, not about those material objects and imperfect intelligences which we meet within our daily interactions with all mankind, but rather it investigates the nature of those purer and more perfect patterns which are the models after which all created beings are formed. Plato supposes these perfect types to exist from all eternity and calls them the &quot;Forms&quot; or &quot;Ideas&quot;. As these Forms cannot be perceived by human senses, whatever knowledge we attain of the Forms must be seen through the mind&#x27;s eye (cf. &quot;Parmenides&quot; 132a), while ideas derived from the concrete world of flux are ultimately unsatisfactory and uncertain (see the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;). He maintains that degree of skepticism which denies all permanent authority to the evidence of sense. In essence, Plato suggests that justice, truth, equality, beauty, and many others ultimately derive from the Form of the Good.

===Aristotle&#x27;s criticism===
Aristotle discusses the Forms of Good in critical terms several times in both of his major surviving ethical works, the &quot;Eudemian&quot; and &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. Aristotle argues that Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good does not apply to the physical world, for Plato does not assign &quot;goodness&quot; to anything in the existing world. Because Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good does not explain events in the physical world, humans have no reason to believe that the Form of the Good exists and the Form of the Good is thereby irrelevant to human ethics.

===Other criticisms===
Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good is often criticized as too general. Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good does not define things in the physical world that are good, and therefore lacks connectedness to reality. Because Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good lacks instruction, or ways for the individual to be good, Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good is not applicable to human ethics since there is no defined method for which goodness can be pursued. Through Socrates in &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato acknowledges the Form of the Good as an elusive concept and proposes that the Form of the Good be accepted as a hypothesis, rather than criticized for its weaknesses. According to Socrates in &quot;The Republic&quot;, the only alternative to accepting a hypothesis is to refute all the objections against it, which is counterproductive in the process of contemplation.

Aristotle along with other scholars sees the Form of the Good as synonymous with the idea of One. Plato claims that Good is the highest Form, and that all objects aspire to be good. Since Plato does not define good things, interpreting Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good through the idea of One allows scholars to explain how Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good relates to the physical world. According to this philosophy, in order for an object to belong to the Form of the Good, it must be One and have the proper harmony, uniformity, and order to be in its proper form.

Philosopher Rafael Ferber dismissed Aristotle&#x27;s view that the &#x27;Good&#x27; is &#x27;One&#x27; and wrote that the Form of the Good is self-contradictory. Ferber claimed that Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good could be simultaneously defined and unknown, and be in a state of both &quot;being&quot; and &quot;not being&quot;.

Plato&#x27;s Forms are also critiqued for being treated as the reason for all things, as opposed to being an essence in itself. Some scholars also believe that Plato intended the Form to be the essence of which things come into existence. These different interpretations of Plato&#x27;s intention for the Form may be attributed to the idea that Plato did not have a systematic definition of the Form itself.

==Influence==
Plato&#x27;s writings on the meaning of virtue and justice permeate through the Western philosophical tradition. Plotinus, the founder of neoplatonism, had principles that were heavily influenced by the Good. His concept of &#x27;the One&#x27; is equivalent to &#x27;the Good&#x27; because it describes an ultimate ontological truth. &#x27;The One&#x27; is both &#x27;uncaused&#x27; and the cause of being for everything else in the universe. Plotinus compared his principle of &#x27;the One&#x27; to an illuminating light, as Plato did with the Form of the Good. As a result of Plotinus&#x27; school of neoplatonism, the bulk of understanding of Platonic philosophy until the 19th century came through Plotinus&#x27; interpretation of it. Many theologians and philosophers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam looked to the ideas of Platonism through the lens of Plotinus.

Amphis, a comic playwright of Athens, has one of his characters say: &quot;And as for the good that you are likely to get on her account, I know no more about it, master, than I do of the good of Plato.&quot; There is an ancient anecdotal tradition that Plato gave a public lecture entitled &quot;On the Good&quot; which so confused the audience that most walked out. At the end of the lecture Plato said to those hearers who remained: &#x27;The Good is the One&quot;.

<doc id="314418" wikidata="Q524562" url="?curid=314418" title="Charles, Duke of Mayenne">
<text>Charles de Lorraine, duc de Mayenne (26 March 1554¬†‚Äì3 October 1611) was a French noble, governor, military commander and rebel during the latter French Wars of Religion. Born in 1554, the second son of Fran√ßois de Lorraine, duke of Guise and Anne d&#x27;Este, Mayenne inherited his fathers&#x27; position of &quot;Grand Chambellan&quot; in 1563 upon his death. He fought at the siege of Poitiers for the crown in 1569, and crusaded against the Ottomans in 1572. He served under the command of the king&#x27;s brother Anjou during the siege of La Rochelle in the fourth war of religion, during which he was wounded. While the siege progressed, his uncle was killed by a cannonball, and he inherited his position as governor of Bourgogne. That same year, his marquisate of Mayenne was elevated to a &quot;duch√© pairie&quot;. He travelled with Anjou when he was elected as king of the Commonwealth and was a member of his court there until early 1574 when he departed on crusade again. Returning to France, he served in the fifth war of religion for Anjou, now king Henri III of France, but his badly underfunded army was unable to seriously impede the Protestant mercenary force under Casimir. He aligned himself with the Catholic &quot;Ligue&quot; that rose up in opposition to the generous Peace of Monsieur and fought in the sixth war of religion that resulted, serving at the sieges of La Charit√©-sur-Loire and Issoire. During 1576, he married Henriette de Savoie-Villars, securing a sizable inheritance in the south west, and the title of Admiral on the death of her father in 1578. Mayenne was granted full command of a royal army during the seventh war of religion in 1580, besieging the Protestant stronghold of La Mure successfully, and clearing several holdout towns after the peace. In 1582 he was obliged to surrender his title of Admiral to Joyeuse, a favourite of Henri. The following year he was involved in an abortive plan to invade England, though it came to nothing due to lack of funds.

In 1584, the king&#x27;s brother Alen√ßon died, and the Protestant Navarre became heir to the throne. This was unacceptable to Mayenne, and many other radical Catholics across France. Resultingly, Mayenne, his brother Guise and various family allies formed a second Catholic &quot;ligue&quot; at Nancy in September 1584, to push the succession of Cardinal Bourbon, Navarre&#x27;s Catholic uncle. They formed a compact with Philip II of Spain in December, and entered rebellion against the crown in March 1585. Mayenne seized many of the cities of his governate, and the crown was forced to terms in July, conceding to the &quot;ligue&quot; that Navarre would be excluded from the succession, and that the crown would conduct a war on heresy. Over the following years, Mayenne vigorously pursued attempts to campaign against the Protestants of the south, however Henri&#x27;s participation was half hearted, and on a frustrated return to Paris in early 1587, Mayenne was at minimum sympathetic to a failed &quot;ligueur&quot; plan to seize the capital. Returning south he captured Mons√©gur in mid 1587 but was increasingly unable to make progress for lack of funds. In May 1588, Henri engineered a showdown with the radical Catholics of the capital, but was bested and driven from the city. Forced to make concessions he agreed to establish an Edict of Union, with religiousity overriding Salic Law in determining succession, and to appoint Mayenne to lead one of his principal armies for a war against heresy. At the Estates General, demanded by the &quot;ligue&quot;, that was called a few months later, the Third Estate demanded the funds they offered be given directly to Mayenne. At a breaking point, Henri arranged for the assassination of the duke of Guise and Cardinal Guise in December, upon which his kingdom erupted into broad rebellion.

In February 1589, Mayenne accepted appointment by the &quot;Seize&quot; regime in Paris as lieutenant-general of the kingdom, he visited many &quot;ligueur&quot; aligned cities in the north east, reorganising their administrations as best he could on lines that suited him. In May he fought with Henri outside Tours, but was pushed back. Henri now allied with his Protestant heir Navarre, and the two began a campaign towards the capital that culminated in a brief siege at the end of July, that was broken by the Assassination of Henri III on 1 August. With Navarre now the royalist king, Mayenne was able to secure further defections to the &quot;ligueur&quot; cause from cities and grandees who had previously remained loyal. He repeatedly clashed with Henri in Normandie, first at Arques then at Battle of Ivry, being bested both times. Henri moved to besiege Paris after the latter, and it was only with Spanish aid that Mayenne was able to save the capital. During 1592 he again required Spanish aid to assist with rebuffing the gruelling siege of Rouen. Considerably indebted to the Spanish, he assented to the calling of an Estates General in 1593 to choose a new king, Bourbon having died. The assembly was unable to come to much agreement, and Henri converted to Catholicism during the proceedings, removing a key hurdle to his acceptance. In 1594, Paris opened its gates to him, and Mayenne was forced to retreat to Bourgogne. After the failure of one final campaign at the Battle of Fontaine-Fran√ßaise in July 1595, he abandoned the Spanish and prepared to return to the royalist camp. By his submission in January 1596 he was returned to loyalty, and received 3 surety towns, a large bribe and a reduced version of the governorship of √éle de France. He fought with the king against the Spanish at Amiens, and thereafter faded into retirement. He died in 1611.

==Early life and family==
===Siblings===

Charles de Lorraine, born in 1554, was the second son of Fran√ßois de Lorraine, duke of Guise and Anne d&#x27;Este. His elder brother Henri de Lorraine was born in 1549, while his younger brother Louis de Lorraine was born in 1555. He also had an elder sister, Catherine de Lorraine one year junior of Henri. In a rendition of the Adoration of the Magi, commissioned by Fran√ßois for the &quot;h√¥tel de Guise&quot; in Paris, the duke is depicted as one of the Magi, while Mayenne and his elder brother appear as the Magi&#x27;s pages.

===Marriage and children===
In 1576, Mayenne secured a marriage to the wealthy heiress Henriette de Savoie-Villars, who brought with her a dowry of 1,275,000 &quot;livres&quot;. She also provided an inheritance in the south west, an area the Lorraine&#x27;s traditionally had little influence. Among these lands were the comt√© de Montpezat. Her father Admiral Villars also promised that Mayenne would inherit his office of Admiral, the second most senior military office in France, upon his death. The two were married on 6 August at Meudon, the first of three weddings the Lorraine&#x27;s celebrated that year. Together they would have:

*Ren√©e de Lorraine (d. 1638) married Mario Sforza and had issue
*Henri de Lorraine, duke of Mayenne (1578‚Äì1621) married Henriette Gonzague, daughter of Louis de Gonzague, Duke of Nevers
*Charles Emmanuel de Lorraine, Count of Sommerive (1581‚Äì1609) never married;
*Catherine de Lorraine (1585‚Äì1618) married Carlo di Gonzaga, Duke of Mantova

A royalist by 1598, Mayenne would marry a son and a daughter into the Nevers family, which had ultimately sided with Henri IV.

===Personality===
Much like his brother Guise, Mayenne had little interest in the ascetic piety that dominated Henri&#x27;s court. He had a reputation for drunkenness, and had to be taken home in 1593 by the financier Zamet after he got too drunk one night. This preponderance for alcohol impacted his health, and by the end of his life he was in bad shape. Of an overall violent disposition, in 1587 when a captain named Sacremore asked for his daughter in law&#x27;s hand in marriage after admitting to having already seduced her, Mayenne stabbed him to death with his own hands. He had also kidnapped the Protestant noblewoman Anne de Caumont as a prospective bride for his son Henri de Lorraine in 1586.

==Reign of Charles IX==
On the death of his father in 1563, his eldest son, Guise inherited the office of &quot;Grand Ma√Ætre&quot; from his father. Mayenne meanwhile inherited a slightly lesser but still prestigious office in the king&#x27;s household, that of &quot;Grand Chambellan&quot;, responsible for the king&#x27;s furniture and clothes. He held this office until 1589. Despite the prestige of this position, Henri III allowed it to have little real authority during his reign, though he permitted Mayenne to share his table alongside the &quot;Gentilhomme de la Chambre&quot;.

===Military service===
The young Mayenne saw his first military service during the third war of religion. Together with his elder brother, Guise, he participated in the defence of Poitiers against Admiral Coligny&#x27;s Protestant army. Upon hearing of Coligny&#x27;s approach to the city, the two men, alongside the governor of Poitou Guy de Daillon had hurried in before the investment of the city was realised, in the hopes that they would have a chance to revenge themselves on their hated rival. Mayenne and Guise successfully led the resistance to Coligny, overseeing the defence and the rebuffing of attempted assaults. As such Coligny was held up long enough for the king&#x27;s brother Anjou to arrive with the main royal army, crushing Coligny at the Battle of Moncontour shortly thereafter.

Mayenne continually pestered his uncle Lorraine to secure for him a residence in Paris. Aside from these expensive requests, Lorraine was generally concerned for the young boy, as he had developed a dangerous habit of wearing the colour green for his livery, a colour already in use by the duke of Anjou.

===Crusade===
Mayenne&#x27;s family had been prosecuting a feud with Coligny, ever since the assassination of his father, in 1563. This greatly frustrated the crown, seeing the greatly destabilising threat having its two most prominent families at each other&#x27;s throat posed. In 1571 while France was once more at peace, the feud threatened to flare up. To combat this in October, Charles intended to force another show of reconciliation between Guise, Mayenne and Aumale and the Admiral. In a show of strength, Mayenne and Guise entered Paris in force on 14 January, accompanied by 500 retainers. Soon thereafter, Mayenne departed France in April to go on Crusade against the Ottomans, he took with him 200 of the families retainers, a curious move if the family was intending a showdown with Coligny. Mayenne travelled to Corfu where he served with the Venetians for a time, before returning to France. In Mayenne&#x27;s absence, it became apparent their entry to Paris back in January had been aimed at ensuring they did not concede to peace without a show of the families power. Guise arrived at court to make peace with Coligny on 12 May.

Lorraine&#x27;s frustration at his nephews were not over however, as Mayenne had chosen to depart on crusade without receiving royal dispensation to depart France. Lorraine was compelled to write a grovelling letter to the king in which he pleaded for Charles to have &#x27;pity on a poor hopeless and debauched boy&#x27;. Mayenne would be forced to seek pardon from the king upon his return.

In the wake of the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew, the Protestant stronghold of La Rochelle, flooded with refugees, entered rebellion against the crown. This was unacceptable to Charles, and he dispatched Anjou, to take command of an effort to besiege the rebel city into submission. Anjou arrived in front of the city in early 1573, and began a vigorous siege effort. He was accompanied in his arrival at the city by the cream of the French nobility, among them the Protestants Navarre and Cond√©; the firmly Catholic Nevers and members of the Guise family, among them Mayenne. Mayenne was among the notables who Anjou included on his war council, to advise on the conduct of the siege. The siege dragged on inconclusively for months, frustrated by the bickering of its commanders and supply issues. By the summer of 1573, Anjou was looking for an exit, and found one when he was elected king of the Commonwealth. A peace was concluded with the still defiant La Rochelle soon after on 25 June. During the conduct of the siege, Mayenne had received a wound to his leg from the defenders.

===Bourgogne===

At the age of 19, Mayenne became governor of Bourgogne in March 1573 while the siege was still raging, succeeding his uncle Aumale who had died in the fighting at La Rochelle. Aumale in turn had succeeded his father the first duke of Guise, meaning that the Lorraine family had held the governate of Bourgogne since 1543. Despite this long running control of the province, Aumale possessed no lands in the governate, and as such was forced to rely on a clientele network to exert his control. In September 1573, Charles elevated the marquisate of Mayenne to a &quot;duch√©-pairie&quot; for the young prince.

Mayenne accompanied the new king Anjou to the Commonwealth after the conclusion of the siege, as a member of his household. He was with the king for his first meeting with foreign ambassadors to the court. Having stayed with Anjou for several months, Mayenne departed on 20 April, to enjoy the waters at Lucca before again engaging in a brief campaign against the Ottomans. Anjou complained to his favourites who had not departed, about the predilection for crusading of Mayenne and the other departees.

He arrived at Dijon for his ceremonial entry into the capital of his governate the following year, where he was met by a delegation from the city comprising the &quot;Parlement&quot;, mayor, council and other elites. Together they entered Dijon, with Mayenne refusing the privilege of entering under a &#x27;canopy&#x27;, a covering held up by four townsmen, as a way of demonstrating his modesty. This privilege was greatly vaunted by the elite, with Cond√© suing for the right to do so in his governate. In the town, Mayenne was subject to an obsequious speech from the mayor, pledging their loyalty, and willingness to die at his feet in service to the king. Mayenne was determined to have a more hands on role in Bourgogne than had his uncle, who almost entirely ignored his governorship during his lifetime.

==Reign of Henri III==

In May 1574, Charles died, and without a child his brother Anjou succeeded to the throne. For the coronation of Anjou, now styling himself Henri III, Mayenne and the Lorraines had an important role to play. Mayenne, alongside his brother Guise and cousin Aumale, took the role of the three lay peers for the ceremony, while Cardinal Guise crowned the king.

In the confusing combats that characterised the fifth war of religion, Mayenne led an army in late 1575 facing off against a Protestant mercenary force under Casimir von Pfalz-Simmern that had invaded the kingdom. It was one of two main royal armies, the other being commanded by Henri himself at Gien to defend the approaches to Paris. Encamped at Vitry-le-Fran√ßois, Mayenne&#x27;s 10,000 men were ravaged by hunger and lack of pay and were able to do little more than shadow Casimir as he moved to Dijon on 31 January 1576, and then Moulins on 4 March, where he united forces with the &quot;politique&quot; brother of Henri, Alen√ßon. United, the rebel army threatened a march on Paris that Henri no longer had the troops or funds to stop.

===First Catholic &quot;ligue&quot;===
As a result, in May 1576 Henri was forced into a generous peace with the Protestant and &quot;politique&quot; rebels. Many concessions were granted to the Protestant nobility, with the prince of Cond√© afforded the border town of P√©ronne. The governor of P√©ronne and his client√®le reacted furiously, and formed the nucleus of what was to become a national Catholic &quot;Ligue&quot; in opposition to the peace. Henri was alarmed by the rapid spread of the movement, and suspected the hand of the Guise family lay behind it. To this end in August, he had Mayenne, Guise and their ally the duke of Nemours who he suspected of involvement swear an oath to uphold the edict of Beaulieu. During the Estates General of 1576, called as a term of the peace, one of Henri&#x27;s favourites, Saint-Sulpice was murdered by a favourite of Alen√ßon. Mayenne considered himself a protector of the young man, and vowed he would avenge himself on the killer.

The &quot;ligue&quot; was soon able to force Henri to break off from the peace, beginning the sixth civil war in early 1577. Mayenne was among the figures in the council who had advocated for breaking the peace, and resisting calls to bring the new war to an early close. The short peace had however re-secured the loyalty of the king&#x27;s brother to the royal cause, and he volunteered to lead the royal army against his former rebel compatriots. He had little military experience, and authority for the operations of the army would in fact lie with Nevers, Guise and Mayenne. The force set about a siege of La Charit√©-sur-Loire, and then Issoire, putting each to a violent sack. However the army was starved of funds, Henri unable to secure concessions from the estates, and as such by the middle of 1577 it had largely disintegrated, leaving Henri unable to continue prosecuting the war. Mayenne moved off without Alen√ßon with his own force, and on 18 August captured the town of Brouage on the Atlantic coast, with the assistance of the seigneur de Lanssac, securing a considerable supply of salt. Henri was pleased at the reduction, and added Brouage to the royal domain. The Treaty of Bergerac brought the conflict to an end in September. Somewhat harsher than the Peace of Monsieur, it sated the &quot;ligue&quot; movement for the following 6 years.

At court, relations between the favourites of Henri and the grandee families were fraught. On Mayenne&#x27;s orders, one of Henri&#x27;s favourites Saint-M√©grin was butchered as he left the Louvre on 21 July by a gang of 20+ assailants. Rumours had circulated that Saint-M√©grin was attempting to seduce Mayenne&#x27;s sister in law, the duchesse de Guise. Henri was distraught at the death of Saint-M√©grin, but the favourite was otherwise unpopular at court, so Henri mourned alone. The killing came not long after the famous Duel of the Mignons, which had seen another two of Henri&#x27;s favourites killed. He arranged for an elaborate commemoration for the three men, overseeing an ostentatious funeral, and entombing them in marble sarcophagi.

===Favoured one===
Despite rumours of his involvement in the murder of Saint-M√©grin, Henri was happy to permit the transfer of the office of Admiral to Mayenne in 1578. Overall Henri was far more willing to provide major commands to Mayenne than his brother, either due to a greater amount of affection, or a desire to divide the Lorraines by making them jealous of each other.

When Catherine departed on her mission to the south, to sooth the wounds of the civil wars and restore order in provinces that were increasingly fragmented in central control, Mayenne was among those who travelled with her to Montluel for her confrontation with the rebellious former favourite of the king&#x27;s Marshal Bellegarde, during which an agreement was reached between the Marshal and crown.

The following year, Guise, dissatisfied with his lot, toyed with the idea of bringing the family into a group of Malcontents, alongside the Protestant brother of the elector Palatine Casimir. He and Mayenne met with Casimir to discuss a plan to seize Strasbourg, however ultimately nothing would come of this inter-confessional moment, and the Lorraine family returned to their reputation for crushing heresy.

As a result of the relative favour in which he was held, Mayenne commanded a royal army during the brief civil war in 1580, leading it into Dauphin√© against Lesdigui√®res where he captured the Protestant stronghold of La Mure in October, while Matignon reduced the border town of La F√®re up in Picardie. With the Treaty of Fleix concluding the conflict by the end of the year, Mayenne was entrusted with ensuring that it was enforced, and obtaining the submission of the holdout towns of Livron and Gap, a task in which he was successful.

He was not however able to hold the office of Admiral for long, as Henri detached Mayenne from it in 1582, so that he could award it to his favourite Joyeuse, whose trustworthiness was beyond question. In return for yielding this most prestigious office, Mayenne was compensated with 120,000 &quot;√©cus&quot; and the elevation of his cousin, Charles de Lorraine&#x27;s seigneurie from a marquisate to a &quot;duch√©-pairie&quot;.

He was involved in his families abortive plans for an invasion of England in 1583. Several ships were assembled by Elbeuf in August 1583, with an army to be commanded by Mayenne, and Marshal Brissac. He attended council with Guise and Cardinal Bourbon at the governor of lower Normandie Meilleraye&#x27;s Ch√¢teau in August to discuss the details of the invasion. Brissac arrived soon thereafter with bad news, sailing was to be postponed due to lack of funds. Mayenne and the Lorraine family would soon be far too busy in domestic events.

===Second Catholic &quot;ligue&quot;===

Disaster rocked the crown in June 1584, when the heir to the throne, the king&#x27;s brother Alen√ßon, died of tuberculosis. This left the inheritance of the throne on Henri&#x27;s death to the king&#x27;s distant cousin Navarre, a Protestant. Such a succession was intolerable to many Catholics, among them the Guise family. Mayenne, Guise and Cardinal Guise met in Nancy during September with Maineville a representative of Cardinal Bourbon and agreed to oppose the succession. Cardinal Bourbon, Navarre&#x27;s Catholic uncle was to be their candidate for the throne. In December the family concluded an alliance with Philip II of Spain (known as the Treaty of Joinville) by which the Guise made many concessions to Spain in return for financial and political support. Mayenne and his brother were both signatories to the treaty for the &quot;ligueur&quot; side. In his capacity as governor of Bourgogne, Mayenne marshalled his client√®le in support of the &quot;ligue&quot;, while his brother Guise mobilised Champagne, and his first cousins Aumale and Elbeuf prepared for rebellion in their strongholds of Picardie and Normandie respectively.

The &quot;ligue&quot; movement had two wings, the aristocratic, embodied by the Guise family and the &quot;ligue&quot; of 1576; and the urban middle class, as typified by the &quot;Seize&quot; organisation in Paris. While Guise was alive he was tenuously able to hold the two components together in a united purpose, however after his assassination in 1588, Mayenne struggled to replicate this unity, and the &quot;ligue&quot; movement began to splinter.

===War against Henri===
No fool to developments in the kingdom, Henri wrote to Guise, Mayenne and Bourbon on 16 March, asking for them to explain what exactly it was they were up to, while pretending that he of course did not believe reports that they were preparing acts of rebellion.

With open hostilities declared on the crown by Guise&#x27;s armed entry into Ch√¢lons on 21 March, Mayenne quickly moved to secure the major cities of his governate. Mayenne was however furious at his brother for, he felt, jumping the gun with his seizure. The two met at Joinville on 21 April, and Mayenne lambasted his brother for having &#x27;too soon declared and taken up arms&#x27;, Mayenne having preferred a date of 18 April, the day preceding Good Friday. Mayenne argued Guise had allowed Henri to present them as the aggressor and buy off the governors the family had been approaching. Guise retorted that he had been compelled by circumstances, and that to avoid accusation of treason he had ordered Elbeuf to conduct Cardinal Bourbon to P√©ronne to make a declaration.

Over the following months he would seize Dijon, M√¢con and Auxonne for the &quot;ligue&quot;. On 7 July Henri was compelled by the deteriorating situation of his control over the kingdom to sign a humiliating peace where he conceded to most of the &quot;ligueur&quot; demands, including a war against Protestantism. As a term of the peace, Mayenne was granted Beaune as a surety town, alongside possession of the Ch√¢teau of Dijon. The family reunited in Troyes during September 1585 to celebrate their recent victory. Mayenne and Guise, alongside their other relatives participated in numerous festivities, among them a ceremonial burning of a straw figure representing heresy.

===War against the Protestants===
After passing through Paris in October of that year, Mayenne departed alongside Marshal Biron to pursue the now royal war against heresy through attacks against Cond√©. To Mayenne&#x27;s frustration Biron departed the army the following month and returned to the capital.

It became clear in the year that followed that Henri had little interested in prosecuting the war against Protestantism he had agreed to fight. The &quot;ligue&quot; was happy to take the lead, and Mayenne fought with the Protestant duke of Bouillon in the Saintonge and P√©rigord. While initially Mayenne had been placed in command of the sole royal army against Navarre, Henri created several new armies under his two chief favourites Joyeuse and √âpernon during 1586, and Mayenne&#x27;s army was left to founder for lack of funds. He found himself bogged down in endless sieges in the Dordogne. Returning to Paris in January 1587, he was furious at the treatment of his army, the numbers having been decimated further by desertions. While in Paris a plan was concocted among the militant &quot;ligueurs&quot; of the city to seize control of the capital in the future. The group planned to utilise barricades to impede royal movement across the city, however their plan was uncovered by the king, who arrested the ringleaders. Mayenne denied any involvement, meanwhile Poulain, who had revealed the plot to Henri, informed the king that Guise was furious at his brother for planning a coup and leaving him in the dark. Henri was prevented from coming down with a firmer hand on the plotters by the death of Marie de Lorraine in England, who provided the &quot;ligueurs&quot; a strong martyr that invigorated their cause, with churches throughout Paris mourning her.

Back on campaign, he entered Guyenne in mid 1587, capturing the Protestant stronghold of Mons√©gur, however his advance was increasingly slow and he was unable to prevent Cond√© and Navarre from uniting forces. Observing his foundering, Catherine de&#x27; Medici urged her son to send reinforcements to bolster his campaign, which Henri assented to in August, dispatching forces both to Mayenne and his favourite √âpernon who was fighting in Valence.

===Day of the Barricades===

In May 1588, Henri undertook a showdown with the &quot;ligue&quot; in Paris, hoping to reassert his flagging authority. Radical Catholics in Paris rose up against him however and enacted the planned uprising that had been aborted in 1587. With Henri humiliated and forced to flee Paris after the Day of the Barricades, he was pushed to make further concessions to the &quot;ligue&quot; by the Parisian &quot;Seize&quot; to regain his capital. They demanded he recognise the &quot;Sainte-Union&quot;, provide them with six surety towns, sell off all Protestant assets and establish Guise and Mayenne as the twin heads of the royal army for a new campaign against Navarre and the Protestants. Guise would lead a royal army out of Poitou, while Mayenne would command one from Dauphin√©. Henri capitulated to these demands on 5 July and signed the Edict of Union.

Shortly thereafter Henri took a radical step, dismissing all his chief ministers, and bringing in a new set of men, blaming his previous ministers for the disasters of the previous months. Villeroy who had served the king for many years before the abrupt dismissal, offered his services to Henri&#x27;s enemy Mayenne, and was accepted into the circle of Mayenne&#x27;s advisors. When Mayenne took charge as lieutenant-general, he would install Villeroy as a fellow conservative presence on the &quot;Grand Conseil&quot;.

In September an Estates General convened at Blois. The election of deputies for the body was viciously fought between the royalist and &quot;ligueur&quot; parties. Mayenne worked hard in Bourgogne and Poitou to ensure both regions provided &quot;ligueur&quot; slates of representatives. The rest of his family did likewise in their respective zones of authority. Henri hoped to use the occasion to regain the initiative he had lost in Paris. However he was to be disappointed, the delegates being largely &quot;ligueur&quot; in disposition. Only Mayenne was absent among the &quot;ligueur&quot; leadership from Blois after the deputies arrived, due to his responsibilities leading one of the two royal armies. The Estates took it upon themselves to audit the crown&#x27;s finances and were not impressed by what they found. The Third Estate resultingly promised a paltry 120,000 &quot;√©cus&quot; to keep the kingdoms finances afloat, however in a further twist of the knife these were not to go to the king but instead directly delivered to the crown&#x27;s armies under the authority of Mayenne and Nevers.

===Assassination of the duke of Guise===

These continued humiliations and attempts on his authority finally brought Henri to a fateful decision. On 19 December he resolved to execute the duke of Guise and his brother Cardinal Guise, a plan which was carried out from 23 to 24 December. Many theories have been put forward for what finally pushed Henri into the act, among them the request of the estates general for the tax revenue they provided to be given directly to Mayenne. Henri had also received reports that there was considerable jealousy between the more popular and charismatic duke of Guise; and Mayenne, Aumale and Elbeuf, who resented being in his shadow. The killing of the Cardinal was a deeply sacrilegious act, and the &quot;ligue&quot; and Henri competed to present their version of what had transpired to the Pope. In January, Mayenne dispatched Jacques de Diou, a member of the order of Malta to present the &quot;ligueur&quot; interpretation to Pope Sixtus V.

On the days of the assassinations, Mayenne was occupied in Lyon preparing for a new offensive against the Protestants. He was able to only narrowly avoid being arrested by agents of the king in the city, and he hurried back to the security of his governate before arranging for the hiring of 6000 Swiss mercenaries. This accomplished he left from Bourgogne to Paris on 16 January, accompanied by his sister. On route he passed through many cities, securing their allegiance to the &quot;ligue&quot;, arriving in Chartres on 5 February shortly after a &quot;ligueur&quot; coup had thrown out the governor of the city. His entourage arrived in the capital several days later.

===&quot;Seize&quot;===
On 12 February, Mayenne, alongside his cousin Aumale, and ally the duke of Nemours presented themselves before the church of Saint-Jean-de-Gr√®ve in Paris where they were hailed by ecstatic crowds with cries of &#x27;Long live the Catholic princes!&#x27;

The &quot;Seize&quot; regime in Paris created a &quot;Grand Conseil&quot; of 40 members to administer the kingdom. They submitted their proposed member list to Mayenne for his approval, and he gave his assent. This body in turn nominated Mayenne as &quot;lieutenant g√©n√©ral de l&#x27;√âtat et Couronne de France&quot; in February. He swore his oath accepting the position on 13 March. Mayenne took to his new role with enthusiasm, quickly raising a &quot;ligueur&quot; army to fight Henri and Navarre. He further began levying taxes in his governate in the manner of a king. This office gave him far broader authority than the traditional &quot;lieutenant-general&quot; of the kingdom, whose purview was largely military. He confirmed offices as minor as the &#x27;master of the mint&#x27; for the city of Poitiers, and had the authority to appoint figures to offices from the governors of regions to royal sergeants. He worked closely with the Italian financier S√©bastien Zamet, who lent money to the &quot;ligueurs&quot;. The two men regularly dined together in Paris, Mayenne having taken up residence in the &quot;H√¥tel de la Reine&quot;, formerly inhabitaed by Catherine de&#x27; Medici. He and the &quot;Seize&quot; collaborated to install a new leadership of the Paris &quot;Parlement&quot; after the purge of the royalists from the body, with Barnab√© Brisson established as &quot;pr√©mier president&quot;.

Mayenne was keen to secure the grandee Nevers for the &quot;ligueur&quot; cause, but despite his incessant letters Nevers remained loyal to the king.

===Provincial reaction===
In total across France, roughly half of the 50 largest cities defected to the &quot;ligue&quot; in the wake of the assassinations at Blois. Mayenne would be intimately involved in many of their rebellions.

====Rouen====
Rouen experienced its own Day of the Barricades in February 1589, when a &quot;ligueur&quot; regime succeeded in a coup to take the key city. Carrouges, governor of Rouen, initially tried to maintain his place in the city hierarchy following the coup, claiming a conversion to the &quot;ligueur&quot; cause. Few were convinced by this eleventh hour change, and Mayenne himself visited Rouen on 4 March, to install a &quot;ligueur&quot; provincial council, with the more reliable Villars, Meilleraye and his brother Pierrecourt at its head. Mayenne was far more pleased with this regime, having induced it with an aristocratic character through the appointment of friendly elite &quot;ligueurs&quot;. It contrasted with the &quot;Seize&quot; regime in Paris, which Mayenne viewed with distaste. He had been greeted on his entry to the city by &quot;ligueurs&quot; keen to demonstrate their piety, the population filing through the streets for hours in a barefoot procession. Before departing, Mayenne rewarded the city with a series of letters patent in which he reduced their taxes and ordered many offices to be suppressed on the death of their incumbent. Despite this the need to reward his allies would mean that he would attempt to keep the offices active by assigning them to new men, though he was opposed in this by the Rouen &quot;Parlement&quot;.

In Spring 1590, Mayenne appointed Tavannes, a prot√©g√© from Bourgogne, and a noble of he felt, appropriately august lineage, as the head of the provincial council. Tavannes proved a poor choice, quickly alienating the elite of Rouen, and he in turn was ousted from leadership in 1591 by the opportunist governor of Le Havre, Villars. When Mayenne visited Rouen in 1591, Villars camped outside the city with an army, and threatened to defect to the royalist side unless Tavannes was removed as &quot;ligueur&quot; governor of Normandie. Mayenne acceded, and appointed his own son governor, with Villars to act with the full powers of governor until the boy was of age. He further made Villars the &quot;ligueur&quot; Admiral of France.

====Toulouse====
Toulouse was overtaken by a &quot;ligueur&quot; coup in early 1589 also, under the overall authority of the bishop Comminges. Comminges&#x27; leadership of the important city was challenged by Mayenne&#x27;s appointee as military leader of Languedoc Joyeuse, entering the city on 30 September, he secured it for Mayenne&#x27;s moderate faction of the &quot;ligue&quot; after a brief power struggle.

====Troyes====
In Troyes, Mayenne arrived with his troops on 24 January, all officials were expected to swear an oath to the &quot;ligue&quot; in his presence, any who refused were expelled from the city. Mayenne established the second son of the late duke Chevreuse, who was only 11 years old, as governor, forming a governors council in the city for him. After seven weeks of this arrangement, the council was superseded in name as a &#x27;new&#x27; &quot;ligue&quot; council. This council would form one of the twelve provincial councils that the &quot;ligue&quot; operated. Such councils had authority over both financial and military matters, as well as more minute financial decisions, as to determine the appropriateness of ransoms for captured nobles. In theory these provincial councils were to enact orders received from the main &quot;Grand Conseil&quot; in Paris, and thus Mayenne, but they often had an independent streak. During December 1592, Mayenne wrote to the &quot;ligueur&quot; administration of Troyes, warning them about the rumours of Henri&#x27;s plans to convert to Catholicism, reminding them that he would still be excommunicated and thus unworthy to rule France, as such not invalidating their rebellion. Officials in the town were warned that if they accepted his conversion, they would be placed under house arrest.

====Champagne====
Mayenne, in his capacity as lieutenant-general of the kingdom, appointed the young duke of Guise to the position his father had occupied, governor of Champagne. He followed this up with the appointment of the baron de Rosne and Saint-Paul in overall authority as lieutenant-general of Champagne, giving them the effective powers of governor due to the imprisonment of the young duke of Guise. De Rosne had previously served the late duke of Guise as his governor of Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, while Saint-Paul had been made lieutenant-general of Reims by Guise to counter Dinteville&#x27;s influence during the 1580s. Dinteville was the lieutenant-general of the kingdom according to the king. In 1593 Mayenne elevated Saint-Paul to the rank of Marshal as he became increasingly ambitious in Champagne.

====Dijon====
In his governate of Bourgogne, Mayenne was in a strong position at the death of Guise. His client Jacques La Verne was the mayor of Dijon and he had further clients among the &quot;Parlementaires&quot;. He appointed the sieur de Fervaques as lieutenant-general of the province for the &quot;ligue&quot; to replace the royally appointed comte de Charny. He had first nominated Fervaques back in October, for the confirmation of Henri, however that process was now done away with. Yet La Verne was not quick to seize Dijon for the &quot;ligue&quot; in the wake of news reaching the city and only when Mayenne himself arrived on 5 January was Dijon secured for the &quot;Sainte Union&quot;. On 16 January he assembled the city council, and quoted scripture to prove that they owed obedience to the church before they owed anything to Henri. Before departing Mayenne oversaw the taking of an oath, and made the city grandees promise to obey La Verne and not allow troops within their walls without his permission. La Verne was more independent than Mayenne had hoped, and engaged in a power struggle with Fervaques over which of them would control the Ch√¢teau of the city. In April 1589 La Verne imprisoned Fervaques for refusing to swear the &quot;ligueur&quot; oath. Mayenne was increasingly frustrated by his client, and turned to several &quot;Parlementaires&quot;, supporting them in the mayoral elections of 1590 and 1591 against La Verne, but they were unable to overcome his 99% vote margins. In 1592 Mayenne succeeded in getting his candidate elected, La Verne never having been secure in his dictatorial control of the Dijon council. Though the following year La Verne would triumph again, Mayenne would be rid of his former client in 1594, disposing of him permanently after La Verne attempted to hand the Ch√¢teau over to Henri, having him executed.

====Bourgogne====
Mayenne&#x27;s efforts in Dijon were part of a large picture in Bourgogne, of his attempts to influence mayoral elections in the favour of his political interests. He wrote to Fervaques from Paris about his plans for the province, promising to send more troops so that Bourgogne could be &#x27;cleansed of vermin&#x27;, by which he meant any enemies of the &quot;ligue&quot;. In April he replaced Fervaques, who had proved more royalist than anticipated with the baron de Sennecey a long time client of the Lorraines.

====Provence====
The &quot;ligue&quot; movement in Provence was headed by the comte de Carc√®s who aligned himself with Mayenne through a marriage to his daughter in law. Mayenne&#x27;s candidate for leadership of the &quot;ligue&quot; in Provence was opposed by Hubert de Vins and his sister Chr√©tienne d&#x27;Aguerre, comtesse de Sault. After the death of her brother in November 1589 she took charge of their faction, and invited the duke of Savoie into Aix. He entered in November 1590, bringing about the triumph of the faction of Sault over the faction preferred by Mayenne, that of Carc√®s.

====Provincial overview====
In total there were 12 provincial &quot;ligueur&quot; councils across France, Agen, Amiens, Bourges, Dijon, Le Mans, Lyon, Nantes, Poitiers, Riom, Rouen, Toulouse and Troyes. Mayenne would have preferred to govern without them and where possible he shaped them towards his aristocratic vision of the &quot;ligue&quot;.

===War against Henri===
Departing from Paris in the wake of his elevation to lieutenant-general of the kingdom, Mayenne headed to Orl√©ans, which had rebelled against its governor Entragues on 23 December having got word of Henri&#x27;s coup in Paris. Henri was keen to re-secure the city, but Mayenne reached Orl√©ans first. Upon his entry the royal garrison abandoned the citadel which they had retreated to after losing the main city. Having returned to Paris, he departed again on 8 April at the head of a new army assembled at √âtampes which numbered over 10,000 men. He subdued Vend√¥me in mid April causing consternation in the royal camp at Tours. On 28 April Mayenne participated in a bloody skirmish with the comte de Brienne, brother in law to Henri&#x27;s favourite √âpernon, 50 &quot;ligueurs&quot; were killed but Brienne surrendered, a cause for great celebration in Paris.

===Alliance of the kings===
Conscious of his incredibly tenuous position in the wake of having assassinated the duke, Henri turned to Navarre for support and the two king&#x27;s entered a compact on 3 April. The treaty specified that Navarre was to march against the forces under Mayenne, and drive him from the field. This accomplished, they devised a plan to seize back Paris for the crown, with both to approach from different directions.

Mayenne was almost able to capture the king in a surprise attack at Tours on 8 May, catching Henri off guard during a private visit to the Abbey of Marmoutier outside the walls. Henri was able to retreat into Tours, and Mayenne&#x27;s artillery pummelled Henri&#x27;s residence in the hours that followed. He sent appeals to Navarre, who promptly forwarded reinforcements. With reinforcements at hand, Henri was able to rebuff Mayenne at a narrow bridge into the city and Mayenne was forced to withdraw soon thereafter. The battle had cost the lives of 200 royalists, among them a member of the &quot;Quatre Cinq&quot;, Henri&#x27;s bodyguard unit which had carried out the murder of the duke of Guise. Mayenne ensured the head was dispatched to Paris to be displayed, while pamphleteers in the capital proclaimed his great victory at Tours. That same month George d&#x27;Avoy approached Henri, offering to kill Mayenne. Henri was suspicious and under interrogation George confessed to being sent by Mayenne to murder Henri. Rebuffed at Tours, Mayenne moved into Normandie, seizing Alen√ßon. Normandie was in the midst of a peasant revolt known as the &quot;Lipans&quot; and thousands flocked to Mayenne&#x27;s banner, though he was uninterested in their cause and rejected offers from them to aid him.
Ultimately, Mayenne and Aumale vainly sought to halt the advance of the two men&#x27;s forces, and the royalists captured √âtampes, Montereau and Senlis. He visited the &quot;ligueur&quot; controlled city of Reims in early July, causing much panic in Ch√¢lons, the only major city in Champagne still loyal to the royalist cause. Returning to the capital, Mayenne busied himself trying to strengthen the outer perimeter of Paris in preparation for what seemed likely to come. In this effort, he vainly sought to stop them from capturing the strategic town of Pontoise on 26 July which controlled much of the supply into Paris, but his relief effort arrived too late. By the end of July the royalists were in a position to invest Paris. Mayenne looked desperately for outside assistance, receiving a welcome coup when forces under Claude de La Ch√¢tre &quot;ligueur&quot; governor in Berry arrived to bolster the garrison. He looked to Felipe and the duke of Parma for further aid, promising Felipe the title of &#x27;protector of the kingdom&#x27; and an allowance to keep any fortresses he captured from Protestants during a campaign into France.

==Reign of Henri IV==
===New order===
The death of the king on 1 August represented a significant opportunity for Mayenne and the &quot;ligue&quot;, as the prospect of a Protestant king was no longer a future hypothetical for the cities and nobles of France. Mayenne dispatched the &quot;R√©glement de l&#x27;Union&quot; to various cities which had maintained their loyalty, or a calculated neutrality. He made concerted efforts in the moment to bring over Ch√¢lons, the only significant royalist hold out in Champagne, but his letters were ignored and the city swore itself to Henri IV. Several of Henri&#x27;s favourites defected to Mayenne on the king&#x27;s death, bringing over their cities with them. Chief among them Vitry the governor of Meaux and Entraguet the governor of Orl√©ans.

===Poitiers===
Among the cities to defect was Poitiers, which quickly took the opportunity to formally declare itself for the &quot;ligue&quot;, with an oath on 21 August. Despite their newfound affiliation to the &quot;ligue&quot;, Poitiers had more in common with the &quot;Seize&quot; in Paris than Mayenne&#x27;s vision of the &quot;ligue&quot;. The city bitterly resisted his appointment of La Guierche as governor of Poitou, the people of Poitiers wrote to Mayenne to complain about him, and in January 1591, radical &quot;ligueurs&quot; besieged La Guierche in his Ch√¢teau eventually taking him prisoner, before being reconciled with him after the destruction of the Ch√¢teau. In September 1591, after having slipped back into the city, the council demanded La Guierche leave, and go fight with Mayenne&#x27;s army. The city also circumvented Mayenne&#x27;s authority through direct dealings with the Spanish. Mayenne assured Poitiers he would dispatch the young duke of Guise, who had escaped captivity in August 1591, to the city. Mayenne granted the prince a commission to take command over all &quot;ligueur&quot; operations in central and western France. Mayenne would ultimately disappoint Poitiers in their ambition to have Guise as their governor, selecting instead Marshal Brissac. The city proved amenable to this choice however, in a way they had never been with the late La Guierche.

Henri&#x27;s death, meant that the &quot;ligueur&quot; candidate for the succession was now king as Charles X in &quot;ligueur&quot; cities, he would however remain a captive until his death. Mayenne took the opportunity to abolish the &quot;Grand Conseil&quot; in its original form, re-establishing it on lines more agreeable to him as an advisory council for his leadership. This was despite the protestations of the &quot;Seize&quot; which had originally constituted it. The &quot;Seize&quot; formally petitioned him in February and April to reconstitute its original form, but Mayenne ignored them.

===Arques===

The siege of Paris was made unviable by the death of the king, and Navarre, now styling himself Henri IV moved north into Normandie with the remnants of the royal army. Mayenne gave chase in September, declaring that he would drive Henri into the sea, or bring him back to Paris in chains. The two sides met at Arques for a series of engagements in September, during which Mayenne was handed a bruising defeat.

Late in the year, Mayenne organised the capture of the bishop Nicolas Fum√©e the Bishop of Beauvais for the crime of recognising Henri IV as the new king. Mayenne brought him to Paris and demanded the Papal Legate sentence him to death, but the Legate was uninterested, and Mayenne therefore ransomed the prelate for 900 &quot;√©cus&quot;. In other cases, Mayenne and Henri took it upon themselves to appoint loyal administrators to bishoprics whose bishops were loyal to the other side, and had thus fled. The Papacy confirmed several of Mayenne&#x27;s choices, meaning that after his abjuration Henri found himself compelled to accept many of them, as in his treaty with the Duke of Joyeuse where he acknowledged Mayenne&#x27;s choice of Anne de Murviel as bishop of Montauban.

===Ivry===

In March 1590 the two sides met again in battle at Ivry where Mayenne was again bested. Mayenne had brought a force of 18,000 to bear against Henri&#x27;s army of 13,000. The two commanders led the centre of their respective armies, with Mayenne advanced on the royalist centre, only to have his charge broken, the battle developed strongly in Henri&#x27;s favour. Mayenne and the senior officers were forced to flee with whatever men they could extricate, Mayenne himself had lost his standard of Lorraine to the marquis of Rosny who presented it to the victorious Henri.

This battle was far closer to Paris, and Henri, hoping to use the momentum to achieve total victory, moved south to make another attempt on the capital. Henri besieged Paris for several months, causing considerable hardship for those within the capital as food ran out. The experience radicalised further the Parisian &quot;ligue&quot;, moving it away from Mayenne and his aristocratic &quot;ligueurs&quot;. Mayenne alone was unable to relieve the siege, and as such the &quot;Seize&quot; turned to Felipe for support, securing agreement for military aid in August through the threat that Paris&#x27; fall would entail a Protestant France. Mayenne, in conjunction with the duke of Parma who had been dispatched from the Spanish Netherlands by Felipe joined forces at Meaux near Paris, and successfully forced Henri to abandon his siege. Henri sought to bring the army to battle, but Parma avoided any attempted engagement, before returning to the Spanish Netherlands despite Mayenne&#x27;s pleas for him to stay. Shortly before his departure he had been with Mayenne when a deputation from the &quot;Seize&quot; came to their camp to petition Mayenne. The &quot;Seize&quot; complained about Mayenne&#x27;s usurpation of their vision of the &quot;Grand Conseil&quot; and asked for the restoration of the original vision, they further protested the aristocratic direction he was taking the &quot;ligue&quot;, and asked for him to authorise a tribunal to hunt for &quot;politiques&quot; in the magistracy. They received a cold reception, Mayenne unwilling to conceded any of their demands, and some in his entourage suspecting the &quot;Seize&quot; delegation of being republicans. Shortly thereafter he rigged the Parisian elections the &quot;Seize&quot; had instituted to ensure a suitably conservative set of candidates were returned.

In the wake of Cardinal Bourbon&#x27;s death in captivity in 1590, the &quot;ligueur&quot; candidate for the throne became an open question. Mayenne tentatively pushed his own potential claim to the throne, though Paris preferred the young duke of Guise and Felipe pushed for Isabella Clara Eugenia his daughter with Elisabeth de Valois. Looking for support for the prospect of his elevation, Mayenne dispatched Anne d&#x27;Escars the Bishop of Lisieux to Rome to inquire as to the Pope&#x27;s opinion on the prospect.

===Barnab√© Brisson and the destruction of the &quot;Seize&quot;===

The &quot;ligue&quot; in Paris was frustrated by the moderate &quot;ligueur&quot; elements, and moved against &quot;Parlementaire&quot; &quot;ligueurs&quot; who they felt were insufficiently committed to the &quot;Seize&quot; program in November 1591, executing three of them, including the premier pr√©sident Barnab√© Brisson who they had installed as head of the &quot;Parlement&quot; only two years prior. Mayenne was outraged by this affront to the noble &quot;Parlementaires&quot; and retaliated against the &quot;Seize&quot;, entering the capital on 18 November after having determined he would not be opposed in his efforts by the Spanish garrison, and ordering the execution of those who had led the campaign, and the imprisonment of members of the &quot;Seize&quot;. It was necessary for him to be sure of the Spanish, as the radical &quot;ligueurs&quot; were far closer to the Spanish than he was. Other leaders of the &quot;Seize&quot; such as Bussy-Leclerc and Cruc√© were expelled from the city, and he took control of the Bastille

Normandie had become the main theatre in which the conflict between Henri and the &quot;ligue&quot; was fought, and the two sides again met in early 1592 during the siege of Rouen. The food starved city begged Mayenne for his aid, but he was ill inclined to risk confronting the combined royal and English army that had invested the city and repeatedly assured them he would arrive soon, while putting off coming to the cities aid. On 21 April, the duke of Parma arrived and Henri was forced to lift the siege. Mayenne and Guise entered Rouen in triumph. Parma hoped to go on to crush the main royal army which was in retreat to Pont de l&#x27;Arche, but Mayenne insisted they clear the royalist controlled forts in the vicinity of Rouen.

===Estates General of 1593===

In late 1592, Mayenne was pressured by the Spanish and radical &quot;ligueurs&quot; to convoke an Estates General to validate the claims of the &quot;infanta&quot; to the French throne. Mayenne was frustrated at the requests, and bemoaned to the &quot;pr√©v√¥t des marchands&quot; of Paris &#x27;what more do you people want?&#x27; He would however, reluctantly accept, and 128 deputies gathered in Paris. Among the deputies were thirteen bishops, of whom Mayenne had personally appointed three. This was far fewer deputies than had convened in the previous estates, however royal troops prevented many delegates from making it to Paris. Mayenne delivered the opening address stressing the importance of finding a Catholic king for France. Henri for his part did not recognise the validity of the Estates, however he attempted to open a line of communication with the moderate elements of the body. The radicals in the &quot;ligue&quot; were horrified, but the body as a whole accepted, and a ten-day truce was produced by the dialogue, after talks at Suresnes. The &quot;Seize&quot; denounced the talks, while Mayenne for his part had chosen delegates to participate in them.

On 17 May Henri announced his plan to convert to Catholicism, throwing the Estates into chaos. At the estates the Spanish were increasingly alienating all but the most diehard &quot;ligueurs&quot; with their proposals, including on 28 May a proposal that Felipe&#x27;s daughter the &quot;Infanta&quot; marry Ernst von Hapsburg, and that the new couple would become king and queen. The estates baulked at the idea of two foreigners ruling them with only hardcore elements of the &quot;Seize&quot; sympathetic. The Spanish tried again in early July, proposing a marriage between the &quot;Infanta&quot; and the young duke of Guise, however the moment was gone and this loss of momentum was sealed with Henri&#x27;s attendance of mass at Saint-Denis on 25 July. Mayenne and his other relatives, despite their kinship with the young duke of Guise, and his popularity among the urban &quot;ligue&quot; were little interested in this proposal either. Mayenne was underwhelmed by the young duke, and moreover had tasted enough power himself that he was ill inclined to surrender it to his nephew. His wife crudely described the young duke as &#x27;a little boy, who still needed a spanking&#x27;.

Mayenne for his part had sought to reconfigure the estates, proposing the creation of a fourth estate for the magistracy in May, however this was shot down by the existing estates.

Guillaume du Vair and Le Maistre, two moderate &quot;ligueur&quot; &quot;Parlementaires&quot;, who had walked out of the estates after the Spanish proposal engineered a decree the &quot;Parlement&quot; declaring that no foreign prince could become king of France, earning rebukes from both the &quot;Seize&quot; and Mayenne. The ten day truce that had been agreed in April, bloomed into a larger truce agreed between Mayenne and Henri on 31 July 1593.

By 1593 the radical urban &quot;ligueurs&quot; were fundamentally disillusioned with Mayenne and the other noble &quot;ligueurs&quot;. In pamphlets some proposed abolishing hereditary nobility, and were hurt that Mayenne opposed the candidature of the duke of Guise for election to the French throne. The pamphlet &quot;Le Dialogue d&#x27;entre le Maheustre et le Manant&quot;, written by the exiled Cruc√©, bitterly denounced Mayenne and the other &quot;politique ligueurs&quot;. Mayenne was furious and had the book condemned by the &quot;Parlement&quot;, and the &quot;ligueur&quot; printers who had published it imprisoned. He refused to release the imprisoned men, despite the pleas of both the Spanish ambassador and Papal Legate.

===Truce===
The truce of July 1593, was extended, such that it only expired in early 1594. Mayenne was faced with growing weariness from the cities still loyal to him in Bourgogne, who exploded in anger at his agents both due to the resumption of war, and the particular harshness of the winter.

The war was becoming increasingly dire for Mayenne and the &quot;ligue&quot;, he reacted apoplectically when word reached the capital that nearby Meaux had surrendered to Henri, allegedly tearing the letter bearing the news apart with his teeth. Henri used the capture as a further opportunity to push his charm offensive strategy for Paris, highlighting how well he had treated the city that had surrendered to him. During February, Lyon and Orl√©ans fell to Henri, and Mayenne was increasingly pressured by radicals in the capital to respond to the deterioration. He was urged to expel suspected hundreds of suspected &quot;politiques&quot; from the city, and to install a Spanish garrison of 10,000 men. Mayenne responded that he would support the latter, if the Spanish paid for it.

===Paris falls===

Mayenne departed the capital on 6 March 1594 with his family, and Henri moved to enter Paris on 22 March with the support of the turncoat governor of the city, Brissac. The new regime consolidated their authority quickly. Over 100 unrepentant Mayenne supporters were exiled from the capital. On 30 March, the Paris &quot;Parlement&quot; revoked all laws passed since 29 December 1588, and annulled his authority as &quot;lieutenant-general&quot;. Anyone who obeyed his commands was declared to be guilty of &quot;l√®se majest√©&quot;. Membership of the &quot;ligue&quot; was also outlawed and the only processions would be those of the &quot;Parlementaires&quot;, to commemorate the return of Paris to royal obedience.

Mayenne and Guise met with the lieutenant-general of Champagne, Saint-Paul at Bar-le-Duc in April 1594. Suspicions by this point ran deep on each side that the other was planning to sell them out and defect to Henri. Saint-Paul was denied access to several meetings between Mayenne and the duke of Lorraine, and resultingly decided he was no longer interested in meeting with Mayenne, and set off back to Reims. Guise and Mayenne followed him, arriving outside Reims ahead of him, only to find themselves refused entry. By this time Saint-Paul had reached agreement with Henri, and was just waiting for money for his war against Henri to arrive from Spain, before selling out the &quot;ligue&quot;. On 24 April, having been afforded entry, Guise would murder Saint-Paul after an argument. Mayenne then departed for Soissons, leaving Reims in the hands of Guise.

During the summer of 1594, Mayenne cajoled Spain into providing another army to support him, using his control of Bourgogne as his last remaining leverage of relevance. Philip II obliged and dispatched a force under Karl von Mansfeld. Together the two harried Henri as he attempted to besiege Laon, refusing to give battle and vexing Henri. By July the garrison of Laon capitulated to Henri, and his hands were freed, causing Mayenne to retreat into his heartland of Bourgogne.

===Fontaine-Fran√ßaise===

Increasingly in control of the kingdom by 1595, Henri outlined a broad plan of attack for his subordinates. the duke of Biron was to head into Bourgogne and crush Mayenne there. By this point most of Mayenne&#x27;s clients in Bourgogne had abandoned him, however as Henri had not yet received full absolution from the Pope, Mayenne had chosen to continue the fight. Biron had great success, seizing Autun and Beaune from Mayenne, he then moved into Dijon, occupying the city proper, but struggling to reduce the citadel. Mayenne&#x27;s decision to continue the fight now cost him dearly, as on 20 April, Henri awarded the governorship of Bourgogne to Biron.

The Spanish commander Don Velasco invaded Bourgogne himself, to save Dijon. He linked up with Mayenne and the two advanced up the Sa√¥ne. A portion of the royal army under Henri stumbled into them at Fontaine-Fran√ßaise, though severely outnumbered the royalists gave battle. Mayenne recognised Henri&#x27;s helmet on the field and attempted a massed cavalry charge, but was repulsed by new French units entering the field. Mayenne urged Velasco to bring up the rest of the Spanish forces and overwhelm Henri&#x27;s position but Velasco was cautious, suspecting Henri&#x27;s force was far larger than it really was, and resultingly he withdrew his forces from the field.

===Edict of Folembray===
After the embarrassment of Fontaine-Fran√ßaise, and Velasco&#x27;s refusal to commit more resources to the remaining &quot;ligueur&quot; strongholds in Bourgogne, Mayenne withdrew from the Spanish camp in disgust. Mayenne entered serious talks for his reconciliation with the crown shortly thereafter. His return to submission to the crown was in part facilitated by Zamet, the formerly &quot;ligueur&quot; banker who had joined Henri after his abjuration. In the Edict of Folembray of September 1595 that re-secured his loyalty he was granted three surety towns (Chalon, Seurre and Soissons) for a period of 6 years, the governorship of the √éle de France (but without control over Paris, Melun or Saint-Denis) and a bribe of 900,000 &quot;√©cus&quot;. Despite these sizeable concessions, Mayenne was detached by this edict from his power base and client√®le networks in Bourgogne, the governorship of that province having been given to Biron that April. Moreover, his governorship was little more than a figleaf for his dignity, denied as it was, the major settlements inside its bounds. As part of his reconciliation with Henri, he was acquitted of having played any role in the death of Henri III, and the &quot;Parlements&quot; were forbidden to pursue any cases against him or other &quot;ligueurs&quot; over the murder. This last provision greatly upset Louise de Lorraine, Henri&#x27;s widow, who had been campaigning that justice be done for the murder of her husband.

His return to the royalist camp, came in great part due to the fact that the &quot;ligueur&quot; cause was increasingly a lost one, and if he wished to preserve his titles and landed influence, some form of accommodation was the only way to facilitate this.

He gave his formal submission to Henri in January 1596 at the Ch√¢teau de Folembray, kneeling before the king and denouncing the Spanish and Italian ruses that had led him astray from his true king. Henri embraced him as a courageous and well meaning man, and the two went for a tour of the Ch√¢teau gardens. Henri walked at a demanding pace, leaving Mayenne red faced and out of breath. Mayenne complained to Henri who remarked to him that this would be the only vengeance he ever got against his cousin.

Now a royalist, Mayenne worked to bring over his last remaining kin who fought on in France, his distant cousin Merc≈ìur. Mayenne proposed to the king&#x27;s mistress, Gabrielle d&#x27;Estr√©es a marriage between her son, and Merc≈ìur&#x27;s daughter, Fran√ßoise de Lorraine. She was open to the idea, it affording her the potential of the Penthi√®vre inheritance, and she was able to secure the match.

===Amiens===

The war was by now almost entirely directed against Spain, the internal conflict having ceased. Philip II had taken the opportunity of the chaos of the last few years to seize or buy a number of cities in north eastern France, among them Amiens. In mid 1597, Henri laid siege to Amiens. He found himself unable to rely on his former Protestant co-religionists, who were so disillusioned with him by 1597 that they withdrew their forces from his army. Instead his siege was led by Catholic notables, among them his former enemy Mayenne. Mayenne was delighted to have an opportunity to demonstrate his skills as a strategist to Henri. In an odd twist, Mayenne was now fighting against his cousin, Aumale who fought for the Spanish at Amiens, having resisted all offers from Henri and resultingly becoming a Spanish agent. The royal army entered Amiens on 25 September, and Henri was delighted at the performance of his army.

===Edict of Nantes===

When in 1598, Henri promulgated the famous Edict of Nantes, exceptions were carved out from the edict for those cities and towns that had been granted to the principal former &quot;ligueurs&quot; including Mayenne, to ensure they would not have to permit Protestantism in their territories. The edict ran into vociferous objections from many quarters, and in December 1598, Henri reviewed the edict in council. In response to criticisms that Protestants were allowed to access high offices, Henri highlighted that he allowed his former enemies, the &quot;ligueurs&quot; in high authority, he could not reasonably deny the Protestants who had supported him high office. Mayenne who was present at the council, did not object to this argument. He would later be approached by militant Catholics who asked him to overturn the edict, however Mayenne, now a royalist, refused their requests.

As a reward for his loyalty, in 1599, Henri erected the duchy of Aiguillon from the queen&#x27;s lands for his eldest son, citing the services given to him by Mayenne as a reason for his decision. Marguerite was greatly upset that her lands were being requisitioned to reward the son of a former rebel and succeeded in convincing her husband to annual the young Mayenne&#x27;s judicial rights over the duchy

===Death===
Having attended Henri&#x27;s royal council more frequently in the early years of his uncontested reign, Mayenne faded from attendance as the years wore on. Neither he nor his nephew Guise would threaten the monarchy in the following decade. Mayenne died in 1611 at Soissons, and was succeeded as duke of Mayenne by his son Henri.

<text>Raoul-Pierre Pictet (4 April 1846 ‚Äì 27 July 1929) was a Swiss physicist. Pictet is co-credited with French scientist Louis-Paul Cailletet as the first to produce liquid oxygen in 1877.

== Biography ==
Pictet was born in Geneva. He served as professor in the university of that city. He devoted himself largely to problems involving the production of low temperatures and the liquefaction and solidification of gases.

On December 22, 1877, the Academy of Sciences in Paris received a telegram from Pictet in Geneva reading as follows: &quot;Oxygen liquefied to-day under 320 atmospheres and 140 degrees of cold by combined use of sulfurous and carbonic acid.&quot; This announcement was almost simultaneous with that of Cailletet who had liquefied oxygen by a completely different process.

Pictet died in Paris in 1929.

<text>The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) is a coalition of non-governmental organizations whose objective is a world free of anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions, where mine and cluster munitions survivors see their rights respected and can lead fulfilling lives.

The coalition was formed in 1992 when six organisations with similar interests (France-based Handicap International, Germany-based Medico International, UK-based Mines Advisory Group, and US-based Human Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights and Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation) agreed to cooperate on their common goal. The campaign has since grown and spread to become a network with active members in some 100 countries‚Äîincluding groups working on women, children, veterans, religious groups, the environment, human rights, arms control, peace and development‚Äîworking locally, nationally and internationally to eradicate antipersonnel landmines. A prominent supporter was Diana, Princess of Wales.

The organization and its founding coordinator, Jody Williams, jointly received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to bring about the Mine Ban Treaty (Ottawa Treaty). The signature of this treaty (which bans the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of anti-personnel mines) is seen as the campaign&#x27;s greatest success. The prize was received on the organisation&#x27;s behalf by its co-founder, Rae McGrath of the Mines Advisory Group and by Tunn Channareth, a Cambodian mine victim and ICBL activist.

The ICBL monitors the global mine and cluster munition situation (through Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor, its research and monitoring arm), and conducts advocacy activities, lobbying for implementation and universalization of the Mine Ban Treaty, humanitarian mine action programs geared toward the needs of mine-affected communities, support for landmine survivors, their families and their communities, and a stop to the production, use and transfer of landmines, including by non-State armed groups. The ICBL participates in the periodical meetings of the Mine Ban Treaty process, urges states not parties to the treaty to join and non-state armed groups to respect the mine ban norm, condemns mine use and promotes public awareness and debate on the mine issue, organizing events and generating media attention.

==Organizational structure==

In 2011, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) merged into one unified structure, now known as the ICBL-CMC, in order to realize operational efficiencies and reinforce complementary work. The ICBL and the CMC campaigns remain separate and continue to remind governments of their commitments to implement and promote both treaties. Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor continues its unique civil society monitoring program on the humanitarian and developmental consequences of landmines, cluster munitions, and explosive remnants of war.

The activities of the ICBL-CMC are supported by a Governance Board representative of various elements of the ICBL that provides strategic, financial and human resources oversight. An Advisory Committee provides more regular input to staff and the working of the campaign. Four ambassadors serve as campaign representatives at speaking events and other conferences worldwide. They include Jody Williams, Tun Channareth (Cambodian landmine survivor), Song Kosal (Cambodian landmine survivor), and Margaret Arech Orech (Ugandan landmine survivor and founder of Ugandan Landmine Survivors Association). Currently, the ICBL has 14 staff members based in Geneva (the central office), Lyon, Paris, and Ottawa. Additionally, the ICBL-CMC hosts several interns each year.

==Mine Ban Treaty==

The Mine Ban Treaty, or the Ottawa Treaty, is the international agreement that bans anti-personnel mines. Officially entitled &quot;The Convention on the Prohibition, Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction&quot;, the treaty is sometimes referred to as the Ottawa Convention. The Mine Ban Treaty was adopted in Oslo, Norway, in September 1997 and signed by 122 States in Ottawa, Canada, on 3 December 1997. As of March 2018, there were 164 States Parties to the Ottawa Treaty.

The mine ban treaty suggest several agendas to member states:

# Never use antipersonnel mines, nor to &quot;develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer&quot; them
# Destroy mines in their stockpiles within four years
# Clear mined areas in their territory within 10 years
# In mine-affected countries, conduct mine risk education and ensure that mine survivors, their families and communities receive comprehensive assistance
# Offer assistance to other States Parties, for example in providing for survivors or contributing to clearance programs
# Adopt national implementation measures (such as national legislation) in order to ensure that the terms of the treaty are upheld in their territory

==Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor==

Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor is the ICBL-CMC&#x27;s research and monitoring arm. It is the &quot;de facto&quot; monitoring regime for the Mine Ban Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008. It monitors and reports on States Parties&#x27; implementation of and compliance with the Mine Ban Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and more generally, it assesses the problems caused by landmines, cluster munitions, and other explosive remnants of war (ERW). The Monitor represents the first time that NGOs have come together in a coordinated, systematic, and sustained way to monitor humanitarian law or disarmament treaties, and to regularly document progress and problems, thereby successfully putting into practice the concept of civil society-based verification. Since its creation in 1998, Monitor research has been carried out by a global network of primarily in-country researchers, most of them ICBL-CMC campaigners, and all content undergoes rigorous editing by the Monitor&#x27;s Editorial Team prior to publication.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Capefigue or by his full name Jean-Baptiste Honor√© Raymond Capefigue (1801 ‚Äì December 1872) was a French historian and biographer.

He was born in Marseille, France. At the age of twenty he went to Paris to study law, but soon switched to journalism. He became editor of the &quot;Quotidienne&quot;, and was afterwards connected, either as editor or leading contributor, with the &quot;Temps&quot;, the &quot;Messager des Chambres&quot;, the &quot;Revolution de 1848&quot; and other papers.

During the ascendancy of the House of Bourbon, he held a post in the foreign office, which was due to the royalism of some of his newspaper articles (some of which were collected in his &quot;Diplomatists of Europe&quot;, his only English-translated work). Indeed, all Capefigue&#x27;s works are influenced by his legitimist politics; he believed in the Divine Right of Kings and non-resistance, and found polite words even for the profligacy of Louis XV and the worthlessness of his mistresses.

He wrote biographies of Catherine de&#x27; Medici and Marie de Medici, Anne of Austria, Maria Theresa of Austria, Catherine II of Russia, Elizabeth I of England, Diana of Poitiers and Agn√®s Sorel‚Äîfor he delighted in passing from &quot;queens of the right hand&quot; to &quot;queens of the left.&quot;

His historical works, besides histories of the Jews from the fall of the Maccabees to the author&#x27;s time, of the first four centuries of the Christian church, and of European diplomatists, extend over the whole range of French history. He died at Paris.

The general catalogue of printed books for the Biblioth√®que Nationale contains no fewer than seventy-seven works (145 volumes) published by Capefigue during forty years. Of these only the &quot;Histoire de Philipp-Auguste&quot; (4 vols., 1829) and the &quot;Histoire de la r√©forme, de la ligue et du r√®gne de Henri IV&quot; (8 vols., 1834‚Äì1835) perhaps deserve still to be remembered.

Capefigue was hasty, and although he had access to an exceptionally large number of sources of information, including the state papers, his accuracy and judgment are doubtful. Nonetheless, he was frequently cited by the Scottish historian Sir Archibald Alison in his highly successful &quot;History of Europe During the French Revolution&quot;.

<doc id="314425" wikidata="Q808850" url="?curid=314425" title="Barrel shifter">
<text>A barrel shifter is a digital circuit that can shift a data word by a specified number of bits without the use of any sequential logic, only pure combinational logic, i.e. it inherently provides a binary operation. It can however in theory also be used to implement unary operations, such as logical shift left, in cases where limited by a fixed amount (e.g. for address generation unit). One way to implement a barrel shifter is as a sequence of multiplexers where the output of one multiplexer is connected to the input of the next multiplexer in a way that depends on the shift distance. A barrel shifter is often used to shift and rotate n-bits in modern microprocessors, typically within a single clock cycle.

For example, take a four-bit barrel shifter, with inputs A, B, C and D. The shifter can cycle the order of the bits &quot;ABCD&quot; as &quot;DABC&quot;, &quot;CDAB&quot;, or &quot;BCDA&quot;; in this case, no bits are lost. That is, it can shift all of the outputs up to three positions to the right (and thus make any cyclic combination of A, B, C and D). The barrel shifter has a variety of applications, including being a useful component in microprocessors (alongside the ALU).

== Implementation ==

The very fastest shifters are implemented as full crossbars, in a manner similar to the 4-bit shifter depicted above, only larger. These incur the least delay, with the output always a single gate delay behind the input to be shifted (after allowing the small time needed for the shift count decoder to settle; this penalty, however, is only incurred when the shift count changes). These crossbar shifters require however &quot;n2&quot; gates for &quot;n&quot;-bit shifts. Because of this, the barrel shifter is often implemented as a cascade of parallel 2√ó1 multiplexers instead, which allows a large reduction in gate count, now growing only with &quot;n&quot; x log &quot;n&quot;; the propagation delay is however larger, growing with log &quot;n&quot; (instead of being constant as with the crossbar shifter).

For an 8-bit barrel shifter, two intermediate signals are used which shifts by four and two bits, or passes the same data, based on the value of S[2] and S[1]. This signal is then shifted by another multiplexer, which is controlled by S[0]:

 int1 = IN , if S[2] == 0
 = IN ¬´ 4, if S[2] == 1
 int2 = int1 , if S[1] == 0
 = int1 ¬´ 2, if S[1] == 1
 OUT = int2 , if S[0] == 0
 = int2 ¬´ 1, if S[0] == 1

Larger barrel shifters have additional stages.

The cascaded shifter has the further advantage over the full crossbar shifter of not requiring any decoding logic for the shift count.

== Cost ==

The number of multiplexers required for an &quot;n&quot;-bit word is formula_1. Five common word sizes and the number of multiplexers needed are listed below:
* 128-bit ‚Äî formula_2
* 64-bit ‚Äî formula_3
* 32-bit ‚Äî formula_4
* 16-bit ‚Äî formula_5
* 8-bit ‚Äî formula_6

Cost of critical path in FO4 (estimated, without wire delay):
* 32-bit: from 18 FO4 to 14 FO4

== Uses ==

A common usage of a barrel shifter is in the hardware implementation of floating-point arithmetic. For a floating-point add or subtract operation, the significands of the two numbers must be aligned, which requires shifting the smaller number to the right, increasing its exponent, until it matches the exponent of the larger number. This is done by subtracting the exponents and using the barrel shifter to shift the smaller number to the right by the difference, in one cycle.

<doc id="314428" wikidata="Q1145660" url="?curid=314428" title="Groupie">
<text>A groupie is a fan of a particular musical group who follows the band around while they are on tour or who attends as many of their public appearances as possible, with the hope of meeting them. The term is used mostly describing young women, and sometimes men, who follow these individuals aiming to gain fame of their own, or help with behind-the-scenes work, or to initiate a relationship of some kind, intimate or otherwise. The term is also used to describe similarly enthusiastic fans of athletes, writers, and other public figures.

==Origin in music==
The word &quot;groupie&quot; originated around 1965 to describe teen-aged girls or young women who began following a particular group or band of musicians on a regular basis. The phenomenon was much older; Mary McCarthy had earlier described it in her novel &quot;The Company She Keeps&quot; (1942). Some sources have attributed the coining of the word to The Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman during the group&#x27;s 1965 Australian tour; but Wyman said he and his bandmates used other &quot;code words&quot; for women on tour.

A prominent explanation of the &quot;groupie&quot; concept came from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, which published an issue devoted to the topic, &quot;Groupies: The Girls of Rock&quot; (February 1969), which emphasized the sexual behavior of rock musicians and groupies. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published an article, &quot;Manners And Morals: The Groupies&quot;, later that month. Also that year, journalists Jenny Fabian and Johnny Byrne released a largely autobiographical novel called &quot;Groupie&quot; (1969). The following year, a documentary film titled &quot;Groupies&quot; (1970) was released.

Female groupies in particular have a long-standing reputation of being available to celebrities, pop stars, rock stars, and other public figures. Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant is quoted as distinguishing between fans who wanted brief sexual encounters, and &quot;groupies&quot; who traveled with musicians for extended periods of time, acting as a surrogate girlfriend, and often taking care of the musician&#x27;s wardrobe and social life. Women who adopt this role are sometimes referred to as &quot;road wives&quot;. Cynthia Plaster Caster, Cleo Odzer, Barbara Cope (The Butter Queen) and The GTOs (Girls Together Outrageously), with Pamela Des Barres, in particular, as de facto spokeswoman, are probably the best-known groupies of this type.

A characteristic that may classify one as a groupie is a reputation for promiscuity. Connie Hamzy, also known as &quot;Sweet Connie&quot;, a prominent groupie in the 1960s, argues in favor of the groupie movement and defends her chosen lifestyle by saying, &quot;Look, we&#x27;re not hookers, we loved the glamour&quot;. However, her openness regarding her sexual endeavors with various rock stars is exactly what has enhanced the negative connotations surrounding her type. For example, she stated in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article &quot;Pop &amp; Hiss&quot; (December 15, 2010): &quot;Hamzy, unlike the other groupies, was never looking to build relationships. She was after sex, and she unabashedly shared intimate moments with virtually every rock star‚Äîeven their roadies‚Äîwho came through Arkansas.&quot; However, some groupies also downplayed the sexual connotations of the term. Speaking about the &quot;groupie&quot; label, former baby groupie Lori Mattix stated, &quot;I feel like it&#x27;s been degraded somewhere along the way, and it was never meant to be negative. Groupies in the old days were girlfriends of the band. They were classy and sophisticated, but now you hear the word groupie and you think of hookers and strippers.&quot;

Des Barres, who wrote two books detailing her experiences as a groupie‚Äî&quot;I&#x27;m with the Band&quot; (1987) and &quot;Take Another Little Piece of My Heart: A Groupie Grows Up&quot; (1993)‚Äîas well as another non-fiction book, &quot;Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon&quot;, asserts that a groupie is to a rock band as Mary Magdalene was to Jesus. Her most recent book, &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; (2007), is a collection of wildly varied interviews with classic &quot;old school&quot; groupies including Catherine James, Connie Hamzy, Cherry Vanilla, DeeDee Keel, and Margaret Moser. Des Barres described Keel as: &quot;One of the most intimidating dolls ... a slim strawberry blonde who won the highly prized job of Whisky office manager after her predecessor Gail Sloatman met Frank Zappa and became what we all wanted to be.&quot; Keel was one of the few who has stayed connected in Hollywood and with bands for nearly four decades. Des Barres, who married rock singer/actor Michael Des Barres, also persuaded cult actress Tura Satana, singer and model Bebe Buell, actress Patti D&#x27;Arbanville, and Cassandra Peterson, better known as &quot;Elvira, Mistress of the Dark&quot;, to talk about their relationships with musicians.

Also according to Des Barres&#x27; book, there is at least one male groupie, Pleather, who followed female celebrities such as Courtney Love and members of the 1980s pop group The Pandoras.

The &quot;groupie&quot; label, as it was used in the music scene, has been criticized by some feminist scholars for diminishing the role that women played in supporting and creating music. Norma Coates, a scholar of media and cultural studies, notes that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 1969 special report on groupies also included profiles of women who were not groupies at all but rather musicians in their own right. According to model and groupie Bebe Buell, groupies sometimes became music celebrities in their own right. Speaking about &quot;baby&quot; groupies Sable Starr and Lori Mattix, she stated, &quot;Every rock star that came to L.A. wanted to meet them, it wasn&#x27;t the other way around.&quot; Music critic Ralph J. Gleason noted that as the prominence of the most well-known groupies increased, they became the &quot;people that others looked to when determining whether a band was &#x27;cool.&#x27;

== American space program ==
During the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo American space programs in the 1960s, women would hang around the hotels of Clear Lake in Houston, home to many astronauts, and Cocoa Beach in Florida near the rocket launching site at Cape Canaveral, &quot;collecting&quot; astronauts. Joan Roosa, wife of Apollo 14 Command Module Pilot Stu Roosa, recalled: &quot;I was at a party one night in Houston. A woman standing behind me, who had no idea who I was, said &#x27;I&#x27;ve slept with every astronaut who has been to the Moon.&#x27; ... I said &#x27;Pardon me, but I don&#x27;t think so&#x27;.&quot;

== Sports ==
Groupies also play a role in sports. A puck bunny is an ice hockey fan whose interest in the sport is primarily motivated by sexual attraction to the players rather than enjoyment of the game itself. Primarily a Canadian term, it gained popular currency in the 21st century, and in 2004 was added to the second edition of the &quot;Canadian Oxford Dictionary&quot; which defines it as follows:
Puck bunny: a young female hockey fan, especially one motivated more by a desire to meet the players than by an interest in hockey.

The term is somewhat analogous to the term &quot;groupie&quot; as it relates to rock and roll musicians. Sociological studies of the phenomenon in minor league hockey indicate that self-proclaimed &quot;puck bunnies&quot; are proud as punch&#x27; to have sex with the [players]&quot;, as it confers social status on them. However, these transitory relationships are often contrasted with those of girlfriends, with whom players have more stable, long-term relationships.

&quot;Buckle bunnies&quot; are a well-known part of the world of rodeo. The term comes from a slang term for women (&quot;bunnies&quot;), and from the prize belt buckles awarded to the winners in rodeo, which are highly sought by the bunnies. According to one report, bunnies &quot;usually do not expect anything more than sex from the rodeo participants and vice versa&quot;.

In a 1994 &quot;Spin&quot; magazine feature, Elizabeth Gilbert characterized buckle bunnies as an essential element of the rodeo scene, and described a particularly dedicated group of bunnies who are known on the rodeo circuit for their supportive attitude and generosity, going beyond sex, to &quot;some fascination with providing the most macho group of guys on Earth with the only brand of nurturing they will accept&quot;.

Recently, in Irish sport, particularly in Gaelic Athletic Association sports the term &quot;Jersey Puller&quot; or &quot;Jersey Tugger&quot; has been used to describe females who are romantically interested in players. The term refers to the pulling of a player&#x27;s top. The term can range from who look to be romantically linked with senior intercounty players to local players playing for their parish.

<doc id="314431" wikidata="Q1443054" url="?curid=314431" title="Franklin Clarence Mars">
<text>Franklin Clarence Mars (; September 24, 1883 ‚Äì April 8, 1935) was an American business magnate who founded the food company Mars Inc., which mostly makes chocolate candy. Mars&#x27; son Forrest Mars developed M&amp;M&#x27;s and the Mars bar and founded the Ethel M Chocolate Factory.

==Family==
Mars was born on September 24, 1883, in Walden Township, Pope County, Minnesota. He learned how to hand-dip chocolate candy as a child from his mother Alva, who entertained him while he had a mild case of polio. He began to sell molasses chips at age 19. Mars attended high school at the Breck School, a boarding school then located in Wilder, Minnesota.

Mars and Ethel G. Kissack (1882‚Äì1980), a schoolteacher, were married in 1902 in Hennepin County, Minnesota. Their son, Forrest Mars, Sr., was born in 1904 in Wadena, Minnesota. They divorced sometime before 1910.

Mars and Ethel Veronica Healy (1884‚Äì1945) were married in 1910 and had one daughter, Patricia Mars (1914‚Äì1965).

==Mars, Incorporated==
He started the Mars Candy Factory in 1911 with Ethel V. Mars, his second wife, in Tacoma, Washington. This factory produced and sold fresh candy wholesale, but ultimately the venture failed because there was a better established business, Brown &amp; Haley, also operating in Tacoma.

In 1920, they moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Mars founded Mar-O-Bar Co. and began to manufacture chocolate candy bars. The company later incorporated as Mars, Incorporated. In 1923 he introduced his son Forrest&#x27;s idea, the Milky Way, which became the best-selling candy bar. Mars moved to Chicago in 1929 and settled in River Forest. He became an honorary captain of the Oak Park, Illinois police department.

In 1930, Mars developed the Snickers Bar.

==Death and legacy==
Mars died from heart and kidney issues on April 8, 1935 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Ownership of the family business passed to his son Forrest.

==Horse racing==

In the late 1920s, in Pulaski, Tennessee, Mars bought a number of local farms and constructed a large estate called Milky Way Farm. During its construction, Mars employed more than 935 men from Giles County to build a 25,000 square feet (2,300 m2) clubhouse, more than 30 barns, and a horse racing track. Gallahadion won the Kentucky Derby in 1940 after Mars died.
Mars lived the remainder of his life on the 2,800 acre (11¬†km2) farm and was buried there upon his death in 1935. After Milky Way Farm was sold, the remains of Mars and his wife Ethel V. Mars were moved to a private mausoleum at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis, where they are currently interred.

<text>Louis-Paul Cailletet (21 September 1832 ‚Äì 5 January 1913) was a French physicist and inventor.

== Life and work ==

Cailletet was born in Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine, C√¥te-d&#x27;Or. Educated in Paris, Cailletet returned to Ch√¢tillon to manage his father&#x27;s ironworks. In an effort to determine the cause of accidents that occurred while tempering incompletely forged iron, Cailletet found that heating the iron put it in a highly unstable state, with gases dissolved in it. He then analyzed the gases from blast furnaces, which helped him understand the role of heat in the changes of states (phases) of metals. This brought him to the work of liquefying the various gases.

Cailletet succeeded in producing droplets of liquid oxygen in 1877 by a different method than Raoul Pictet: He used the Joule-Thomson effect; oxygen was cooled while highly compressed, then allowed to rapidly expand, cooling it further, resulting in the production of small droplets of liquid oxygen.

Among his other achievements, Cailletet installed a 300-m/985-ft high manometer on the Eiffel Tower; conducted an investigation of air resistance on falling bodies; made a study of a liquid-oxygen breathing apparatus for high-altitude ascents; and developed numerous devices, including automatic cameras, an altimeter, and air-sample collectors for sounding-balloon studies of the upper atmosphere.

<doc id="314437" wikidata="Q624587" url="?curid=314437" title="Thermography">
<text>Infrared thermography (IRT), thermal video or thermal imaging, is a process where a thermal camera captures and creates an image of an object by using infrared radiation emitted from the object in a process, which are examples of infrared imaging science. Thermographic cameras usually detect radiation in the long-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 9,000‚Äì14,000 nanometers or 9‚Äì14 Œºm) and produce images of that radiation, called thermograms. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero according to the black body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to see one&#x27;s environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature; therefore, thermography allows one to see variations in temperature. When viewed through a thermal imaging camera, warm objects stand out well against cooler backgrounds; humans and other warm-blooded animals become easily visible against the environment, day or night. As a result, thermography is particularly useful to the military and other users of surveillance cameras.

Some physiological changes in human beings and other warm-blooded animals can also be monitored with thermal imaging during clinical diagnostics. Thermography is used in allergy detection and veterinary medicine. Some alternative medicine practitioners promote its use for breast screening, despite the FDA warning that &quot;those who opt for this method instead of mammography may miss the chance to detect cancer at its earliest stage&quot;. Government and airport personnel used thermography to detect suspected swine flu cases during the 2009 pandemic.

Thermography has a long history, although its use has increased dramatically with the commercial and industrial applications of the past fifty years. Firefighters use thermography to see through smoke, to find persons, and to localize the base of a fire. Maintenance technicians use thermography to locate overheating joints and sections of power lines, which are a sign of impending failure. Building construction technicians can see thermal signatures that indicate heat leaks in faulty thermal insulation and can use the results to improve the efficiency of heating and air-conditioning units.

The appearance and operation of a modern thermographic camera is often similar to a camcorder. Often the live thermogram reveals temperature variations so clearly that a photograph is not necessary for analysis. A recording module is therefore not always built-in.

Specialized thermal imaging cameras use focal plane arrays (FPAs) that respond to longer wavelengths (mid- and long-wavelength infrared). The most common types are InSb, InGaAs, HgCdTe and QWIP FPA. The newest technologies use low-cost, uncooled microbolometers as FPA sensors. Their resolution is considerably lower than that of optical cameras, mostly 160x120 or 320x240 pixels, up to 1280 x 1024 for the most expensive models. Thermal imaging cameras are much more expensive than their visible-spectrum counterparts, and higher-end models are often export-restricted due to the military uses for this technology. Older bolometers or more sensitive models such as InSb require cryogenic cooling, usually by a miniature Stirling cycle refrigerator or liquid nitrogen.

==Thermal energy==


Thermal images, or thermograms, are visual displays of the total infrared energy emitted, transmitted, and reflected by an object. Because there are multiple sources of the infrared energy, it is sometimes difficult to get an accurate temperature of an object using this method. A thermal imaging camera uses processing algorithms to reconstruct a temperature image. Note that the image shows an approximation of the temperature of an object, as the camera integrates multiple sources of data in the areas surrounding the object to estimate its temperature.

This phenomenon may become clearer upon consideration of the formula:

:Incident Radiant Power = Emitted Radiant Power + Transmitted Radiant Power + Reflected Radiant Power;

where incident radiant power is the radiant power profile when viewed through a thermal imaging camera. 
Emitted radiant power is generally what is intended to be measured; 
transmitted radiant power is the radiant power that passes through the subject from a remote thermal source, and; 
reflected radiant power is the amount of radiant power that reflects off the surface of the object from a remote thermal source.

This phenomenon occurs everywhere, all the time. It is a process known as radiant heat exchange, since radiant power √ó time equals radiant energy. However, in the case of infrared thermography, the above equation is used to describe the radiant power within the spectral wavelength passband of the thermal imaging camera in use. The radiant heat exchange requirements described in the equation apply equally at every wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum.

If the object is radiating at a higher temperature than its surroundings, then power transfer takes place radiating from warm to cold following the principle stated in the second law of thermodynamics. So if there is a cool area in the thermogram, that object will be absorbing radiation emitted by surrounding warm objects.

The ability of objects to emit is called &quot;emissivity&quot;, to absorb radiation is called &quot;absorptivity&quot;. Under outdoor environments, convective cooling from wind may also need to be considered when trying to get an accurate temperature reading.

==Emissivity==

Emissivity (or emissivity coefficient) represents a material&#x27;s ability to emit thermal radiation, which is an optical property of matter. A material&#x27;s emissivity can theoretically range from 0 (completely not-emitting) to 1 (completely emitting). An example of a substance with low emissivity would be silver, with an emissivity coefficient of 0.02. An example of a substance with high emissivity would be asphalt, with an emissivity coefficient of .98.

A black body is a theoretical object with an emissivity of 1 that radiates thermal radiation characteristic of its contact temperature. That is, if the contact temperature of a thermally uniform black body radiator were , it would emit the characteristic black-body radiation of . An ordinary object emits less infrared radiation than a theoretical black body. In other words, the ratio of the actual emission to the maximum theoretical emission is an object&#x27;s emissivity.

Each material has a different emissivity which may vary by temperature and infrared wavelength. For example, clean metal surfaces have emissivity that decreases at longer wavelengths; many dielectric materials, such as quartz (SiO2), sapphire (Al2O3), calcium fluoride (CaF2), etc. have emissivity that increases at longer wavelength; simple oxides, such as iron oxide (Fe2O3) display relatively flat emissivity in the infrared spectrum.

== Measurement ==
A thermal imaging camera requires a series of mathematical algorithms to build a visible image, since the camera is only able to see electromagnetic radiation invisible to the human eye. The output image can be in JPG or any other image formats.

The spectrum and amount of thermal radiation depend strongly on an object&#x27;s surface temperature. This enables thermal imaging of an object&#x27;s temperature. However, other factors also influence the received radiation, which limits the accuracy of this technique: for example, the emissivity of the object.

For a non-contact temperature measurement, the emissivity setting needs to be set properly. An object of low emissivity could have its temperature underestimated by the detector, since it only detects &quot;emitted&quot; infrared rays. For a quick estimate, a thermographer may refer to an emissivity table for a given type of object, and enter that value into the imager. It would then calculate the object&#x27;s contact temperature based on the entered emissivity and the infrared radiation as detected by the imager.

For a more accurate measurement, a thermographer may apply a standard material of known, high emissivity to the surface of the object. The standard material might be an industrial emissivity spray produced specifically for the purpose, or as simple as standard black insulation tape, with an emissivity of about 0.97. The object&#x27;s known temperature can then be measured using the standard emissivity. If desired, the object&#x27;s actual emissivity (on a part of the object not covered by the standard material) can be determined by adjusting the imager&#x27;s setting to the known temperature. There are situations, however, when such an emissivity test is not possible due to dangerous or inaccessible conditions, then the thermographer must rely on tables.

Other variables can affect the measurement, including absorption and ambient temperature of the transmitting medium (usually air). Also, surrounding infrared radiation can be reflected in the object. All these settings will affect the calculated temperature of the object being viewed.

=== Color scale ===

Images from infrared cameras tend to be monochrome because the cameras generally use an image sensor that does not distinguish different wavelengths of infrared radiation. Color image sensors require a complex construction to differentiate wavelengths, and color has less meaning outside of the normal visible spectrum because the differing wavelengths do not map uniformly into the color vision system used by humans.

Sometimes these monochromatic images are displayed in pseudo-color, where changes in color are used rather than changes in intensity to display changes in the signal. This technique, called density slicing, is useful because although humans have much greater dynamic range in intensity detection than color overall, the ability to see fine intensity differences in bright areas is fairly limited.

In temperature measurement the brightest (warmest) parts of the image are customarily colored white, intermediate temperatures reds and yellows, and the dimmest (coolest) parts black. A scale should be shown next to a false color image to relate colors to temperatures.

==Cameras==
A thermographic camera (also called an infrared camera or thermal imaging camera, thermal camera or thermal imager) is a device that creates an image using infrared (IR) radiation, similar to a normal camera that forms an image using visible light. Instead of the 400‚Äì700 nanometre (nm) range of the visible light camera, infrared cameras are sensitive to wavelengths from about 1,000¬†nm (1¬†micrometre or Œºm) to about 14,000¬†nm (14¬†Œºm). The practice of capturing and analyzing the data they provide is called &quot;thermography&quot;.

Thermal cameras convert the energy in the far infrared wavelength into a visible light display. All objects above absolute zero emit thermal infrared energy, so thermal cameras can passively see all objects, regardless of ambient light. However, most thermal cameras are sensitive to objects warmer than .

Some specification parameters of an infrared camera system are number of pixels, frame rate, responsivity, noise-equivalent power, noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD), spectral band, distance-to-spot ratio (D:S), minimum focus distance, sensor lifetime, minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD), field of view, dynamic range, input power, and mass and volume.

Their resolution is considerably lower than that of optical cameras, often around 160x120 or 320x240 pixels, although more expensive ones can achieve a resolution of 1280x1024 pixels. Thermographic cameras are much more expensive than their visible-spectrum counterparts, though low-performance add-on thermal cameras for smartphones became available for hundreds of US dollars in 2014.

=== Types ===
Thermographic cameras can be broadly divided into two types: those with cooled infrared image detectors and those with uncooled detectors.

==== Cooled infrared detectors ====

Cooled detectors are typically contained in a vacuum-sealed case or Dewar and cryogenically cooled. Cooling is necessary for the operation of the semiconductor materials used. Typical operating temperatures range from to just below room temperature, depending on the detector technology. Most modern cooled detectors operate in the 60 Kelvin (K) to 100 K range (-213 to -173¬†¬∞C), depending on type and performance level.

Without cooling, these sensors (which detect and convert light in much the same way as common digital cameras, but are made of different materials) would be &#x27;blinded&#x27; or flooded by their own radiation. The drawbacks of cooled infrared cameras are that they are expensive both to produce and to run. Cooling is both energy-intensive and time-consuming.

The camera may need several minutes to cool down before it can begin working. The most commonly used cooling systems are peltier coolers which, although inefficient and limited in cooling capacity, are relatively simple and compact. To obtain better image quality or for imaging low temperature objects Stirling cryocoolers are needed. Although the cooling apparatus may be comparatively bulky and expensive, cooled infrared cameras provide greatly superior image quality compared to uncooled ones, particularly of objects near or below room temperature. Additionally, the greater sensitivity of cooled cameras also allow the use of higher F-number lenses, making high performance long focal length lenses both smaller and cheaper for cooled detectors.

An alternative to Stirling coolers is to use gases bottled at high pressure, nitrogen being a common choice. The pressurised gas is expanded via a micro-sized orifice and passed over a miniature heat exchanger resulting in regenerative cooling via the Joule‚ÄìThomson effect. For such systems the supply of pressurized gas is a logistical concern for field use.

Materials used for cooled infrared detection include photodetectors based on a wide range of narrow gap semiconductors including indium antimonide (3-5 Œºm), indium arsenide, mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) (1-2 Œºm, 3-5 Œºm, 8-12 Œºm), lead sulfide, and lead selenide. Infrared photodetectors can also be created with structures of high bandgap semiconductors such as in quantum well infrared photodetectors.

Cooled bolometer technologies can be superconducting or non-superconducting. Superconducting detectors offer extreme sensitivity, with some able to register individual photons. For example, ESA&#x27;s Superconducting camera (SCAM). However, they are not in regular use outside of scientific research. In principle, superconducting tunneling junction devices could be used as infrared sensors because of their very narrow gap. Small arrays have been demonstrated, but they have not been broadly adopted for use because their high sensitivity requires careful shielding from background radiation.

==== Uncooled infrared detectors ====
Uncooled thermal cameras use a sensor operating at ambient temperature, or a sensor stabilized at a temperature close to ambient using small temperature control elements. Modern uncooled detectors all use sensors that work by the change of resistance, voltage or current when heated by infrared radiation. These changes are then measured and compared to the values at the operating temperature of the sensor.

In uncooled detectors the temperature differences at the sensor pixels are minute; a 1¬†¬∞C difference at the scene induces just a 0.03¬†¬∞C difference at the sensor. The pixel response time is also fairly slow, at the range of tens of milliseconds.

Uncooled infrared sensors can be stabilized to an operating temperature to reduce image noise, but they are not cooled to low temperatures and do not require bulky, expensive, energy consuming cryogenic coolers. This makes infrared cameras smaller and less costly. However, their resolution and image quality tend to be lower than cooled detectors. This is due to differences in their fabrication processes, limited by currently available technology. An uncooled thermal camera also needs to deal with its own heat signature.

Uncooled detectors are mostly based on pyroelectric and ferroelectric materials or microbolometer technology. The material are used to form pixels with highly temperature-dependent properties, which are thermally insulated from the environment and read electronically.

Ferroelectric detectors operate close to phase transition temperature of the sensor material; the pixel temperature is read as the highly temperature-dependent polarization charge. The achieved NETD of ferroelectric detectors with f/1 optics and 320x240 sensors is 70-80 mK. A possible sensor assembly consists of barium strontium titanate bump-bonded by polyimide thermally insulated connection.

Silicon microbolometers can reach NETD down to 20 mK. They consist of a layer of amorphous silicon, or a thin film vanadium(V) oxide sensing element suspended on silicon nitride bridge above the silicon-based scanning electronics. The electric resistance of the sensing element is measured once per frame.

Current improvements of uncooled focal plane arrays (UFPA) are focused primarily on higher sensitivity and pixel density. In 2013 DARPA announced a five-micron LWIR camera that uses a 1280 x 720 focal plane array (FPA).
Some of the materials used for the sensor arrays are amorphous silicon (a-Si), vanadium(V) oxide (VOx), lanthanum barium manganite (LBMO), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), lanthanum doped lead zirconate titanate (PLZT), lead scandium tantalate (PST), lead lanthanum titanate (PLT), lead titanate (PT), lead zinc niobate (PZN), lead strontium titanate (PSrT), barium strontium titanate (BST), barium titanate (BT), antimony sulfoiodide (SbSI), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF).

=== CCD and CMOS thermography ===

Non-specialized charge-coupled device (CCD) and CMOS sensors have most of their spectral sensitivity in the visible light wavelength range. However, by utilizing the &quot;trailing&quot; area of their spectral sensitivity, namely the part of the infrared spectrum called &quot;near-infrared&quot; (NIR), and by using off-the-shelf CCTV camera it is possible under certain circumstances to obtain true thermal images of objects with temperatures at about and higher.

At temperatures of 600¬†¬∞C and above, inexpensive cameras with CCD and CMOS sensors have also been used for pyrometry in the visible spectrum. They have been used for soot in flames, burning coal particles, heated materials, SiC filaments, and smoldering embers. This pyrometry has been performed using external filters or only the sensor&#x27;s Bayer filters. It has been performed using color ratios, grayscales, and/or a hybrid of both.

=== Infrared films ===
Infrared (IR) film is sensitive to black-body radiation in the range, while the range of thermography is approximately . So, for an IR film to work thermographically, the measured object must be over or be reflecting infrared radiation from something that is at least that hot.

=== Comparison with night-vision devices ===
Starlight-type night-vision devices generally only magnify ambient light and are not thermal imagers.

Some infrared cameras marketed as night vision are sensitive to near-infrared just beyond the visual spectrum, and can see emitted or reflected near-infrared in complete visual darkness. However, these are not usually used for thermography due to the high equivalent black-body temperature required, but are instead used with active near-IR illumination sources.

==Passive vs. active thermography==
All objects above the absolute zero temperature (0¬†K) emit infrared radiation. Hence, an excellent way to measure thermal variations is to use an infrared sensing device, usually a focal plane array (FPA) infrared camera capable of detecting radiation in the mid (3 to 5¬†Œºm) and long (7 to 14¬†Œºm) wave infrared bands, denoted as MWIR and LWIR, corresponding to two of the high transmittance infrared windows. Abnormal temperature profiles at the surface of an object are an indication of a potential problem.

In &quot;passive thermography&quot;, the features of interest are naturally at a higher or lower temperature than the background. Passive thermography has many applications such as surveillance of people on a scene and medical diagnosis (specifically thermology).

In &quot;active thermography&quot;, an energy source is required to produce a thermal contrast between the feature of interest and the background. The active approach is necessary in many cases given that the inspected parts are usually in equilibrium with the surroundings. Given the super-linearities of the black-body radiation, &quot;active thermography&quot; can also be used to enhance the resolution of imaging systems beyond their diffraction limit or to achieve super-resolution microscopy.

==Advantages==
Thermography shows a visual picture so temperatures over a large area can be compared. It is capable of catching moving targets in real time. It is able to find deterioration, i.e., higher temperature components prior to their failure. It can be used to measure or observe in areas inaccessible or hazardous for other methods. It is a non-destructive test method. It can be used to find defects in shafts, pipes, and other metal or plastic parts. It can be used to detect objects in dark areas. It has some medical application, essentially in physiotherapy.

==Limitations and disadvantages==
Quality thermography cameras often have a high price (often US$3,000 or more) due to the expense of the larger pixel array (state of the art 1280x1024), although less expensive models (with pixel arrays of 40x40 up to 160x120 pixels) are also available. Fewer pixels compared to traditional cameras reduce the image quality making it more difficult to distinguish proximate targets within the same field of view.

There is also a difference in refresh rate. Some cameras may only have a refreshing value of 5 ‚Äì15¬†Hz, other (e.g. FLIR X8500sc) 180¬†Hz or even more in no full window mode.

Also the lens can be integrated or not.

Many models do not provide the irradiance measurements used to construct the output image; the loss of this information without a correct calibration for emissivity, distance, and ambient temperature and relative humidity entails that the resultant images are inherently incorrect measurements of temperature.

Images can be difficult to interpret accurately when based upon certain objects, specifically objects with erratic temperatures, although this problem is reduced in active thermal imaging.

Thermographic cameras create thermal images based on the radiant heat energy it receives. As radiation levels are influenced by the emissivity and reflection of radiation such as sunlight from the surface being measured this causes errors in the measurements.
* Most cameras have ¬±2% accuracy or worse in measurement of temperature and are not as accurate as contact methods.
* Methods and instruments are limited to directly detecting surface temperatures. 

==Applications==


Thermography finds many uses, and thermal imaging cameras are excellent tools for the maintenance of electrical and mechanical systems in industry and commerce. For example, firefighters use it to see through smoke, find people, and localize hotspots of fires. Power line maintenance technicians locate overheating joints and parts, a telltale sign of their failure, to eliminate potential hazards. Where thermal insulation becomes faulty, building construction technicians can see heat leaks to improve the efficiencies of cooling or heating air-conditioning.

By using proper camera settings, electrical systems can be scanned and problems can be found. Faults with steam traps in steam heating systems are easy to locate.

In the energy savings area, thermal imaging cameras can see the effective radiation temperature of an object as well as what that object is radiating towards, which can help locate sources of thermal leaks and overheated regions.

Cooled infrared cameras can be found at major astronomy research telescopes, even those that are not infrared telescopes. Examples include telescopes such as UKIRT, the Spitzer Space Telescope, WISE and the James Webb Space Telescope

For automotive night vision, thermal imaging cameras are also installed in some luxury cars to aid the driver, the first being the 2000 Cadillac DeVille.

In smartphones, a thermal camera was first integrated into the Cat S60 in 2016.

=== Regulation ===
Higher-end thermographic cameras are often deemed dual-use military grade equipment, and are export-restricted, particularly if the resolution is 640x480 or greater, unless the refresh rate is 9¬†Hz or less. The export from the USA of specific thermal cameras is regulated by International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

== In biology ==
Thermography, by strict definition, is a measurement using an instrument, but some living creatures have natural organs that function as counterparts to bolometers, and thus possess a crude type of thermal imaging capability. This is called thermoception. One of the best known examples is infrared sensing in snakes.

== History ==

=== Discovery and research of infrared radiation ===
Infrared was discovered in 1800 by Sir William Herschel as a form of radiation beyond red light. These &quot;infrared rays&quot; (infra is the Latin prefix for &quot;below&quot;) were used mainly for thermal measurement. There are four basic laws of IR radiation: Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation, Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law, Planck&#x27;s law, and Wien&#x27;s displacement law. The development of detectors was mainly focused on the use of thermometers and bolometers until World War I. A significant step in the development of detectors occurred in 1829, when Leopoldo Nobili, using the Seebeck effect, created the first known thermocouple, fabricating an improved thermometer, a crude thermopile. He described this instrument to Macedonio Melloni. Initially, they jointly developed a greatly improved instrument. Subsequently, Melloni worked alone, creating an instrument in 1833 (a multielement thermopile) that could detect a person 10 metres away. The next significant step in improving detectors was the bolometer, invented in 1880 by Samuel Pierpont Langley. Langley and his assistant Charles Greeley Abbot continued to make improvements in this instrument. By 1901, it could detect radiation from a cow from 400 metres away and was sensitive to differences in temperature of one hundred thousandths (0.00001 C) of a degree Celsius. The first commercial thermal imaging camera was sold in 1965 for high voltage power line inspections.

The first civil sector application of IR technology may have been a device to detect the presence of icebergs and steamships using a mirror and thermopile, patented in 1913. This was soon outdone by the first accurate IR iceberg detector, which did not use thermopiles, patented in 1914 by R.D. Parker. This was followed by G.A. Barker&#x27;s proposal to use the IR system to detect forest fires in 1934. The technique was not genuinely industrialized until it was used to analyze heating uniformity in hot steel strips in 1935.

=== First thermographic camera ===
In 1929, Hungarian physicist K√°lm√°n Tihanyi invented the infrared-sensitive (night vision) electronic television camera for anti-aircraft defense in Britain. The first American thermographic camera developed was an infrared line scanner. This was created by the US military and Texas Instruments in 1947 and took one hour to produce a single image. While several approaches were investigated to improve the speed and accuracy of the technology, one of the most crucial factors dealt with scanning an image, which the AGA company was able to commercialize using a cooled photoconductor.

The first British infrared linescan system was Yellow Duckling of the mid-1950s. This used a continuously rotating mirror and detector, with Y-axis scanning by the motion of the carrier aircraft. Although unsuccessful in its intended application of submarine tracking by wake detection, it was applied to land-based surveillance and became the foundation of military IR linescan.

This work was further developed at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in the UK when they discovered that mercury cadmium telluride was a photoconductor that required much less cooling. Honeywell in the United States also developed arrays of detectors that could cool at a lower temperature, but they scanned mechanically. This method had several disadvantages which could be overcome using an electronic scanning system. In 1969 Michael Francis Tompsett at English Electric Valve Company in the UK patented a camera that scanned pyro-electronically and which reached a high level of performance after several other breakthroughs during the 1970s. Tompsett also proposed an idea for solid-state thermal-imaging arrays, which eventually led to modern hybridized single-crystal-slice imaging devices.

By using video camera tubes such as vidicons with a pyroelectric material such as triglycine sulfate (TGS) as their targets, a vidicon sensitive over a broad portion of the infrared spectrum is possible. This technology was a precursor to modern microbolometer technology, and mainly used in firefighting thermal cameras.

=== Smart sensors ===
One of the essential areas of development for security systems was for the ability to intelligently evaluate a signal, as well as warning of a threat&#x27;s presence. Under the encouragement of the US Strategic Defense Initiative, &quot;smart sensors&quot; began to appear. These are sensors that could integrate sensing, signal extraction, processing, and comprehension. There are two main types of smart sensors. One, similar to what is called a &quot;vision chip&quot; when used in the visible range, allow for preprocessing using smart sensing techniques due to the increase in growth of integrated microcircuitry. The other technology is more oriented to specific use and fulfills its preprocessing goal through its design and structure.

Towards the end of the 1990s, the use of infrared was moving towards civilian use. There was a dramatic lowering of costs for uncooled arrays, which along with the significant increase in developments, led to a dual-use market encompassing both civilian and military uses. These uses include environmental control, building/art analysis, functional medical diagnostics, and car guidance and collision avoidance systems.

<doc id="314444" wikidata="Q259687" url="?curid=314444" title="Alex Proyas">
<text>Alexander Proyas ( ; born 23 September 1963) is an Australian film director. He is known for directing the films &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994), &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998), &quot;I, Robot&quot; (2004) and &quot;Knowing&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Alexander Proyas was born in Alexandria (then in the United Arab Republic and now in Egypt) on 23 September 1963, the son of a Greek Cypriot mother and a father from Egypt whose Greek ancestors had moved to Egypt many generations ago.

When he was three years old, the family moved to Australia, where he grew up in the Sydney suburb of Waterloo. He grew up on a housing estate where the main tenants were fellow immigrants and Indigenous Australians, with whom he felt a kinship because they were all often subjected to racism by white Australians.

At age 17, he joined the Australian Film, Television and Radio School and began directing music videos shortly after.

He later moved to Los Angeles to further his career, working on MTV music videos and TV commercials.

==Career==
Proyas&#x27; first feature film was the independent science fiction thriller &quot;Spirits of the Air, Gremlins of the Clouds&quot;, which was nominated for two Australian Film Institute awards in 1988, for costume design and production design and which won a Special Prize at the 1990 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival.

Next, Proyas directed the 1994 superhero fantasy thriller &quot;The Crow&quot; starring Brandon Lee. Lee was killed in an accident during filming, only eight days before the completion of the film on 31 March 1993. After Lee&#x27;s death, Proyas and his producers decided to complete the film, partially rewriting the script and using a stunt double and special effects to film the remaining scenes. &quot;The Crow&quot; was released in May 1994 and was a box office and critical success.

Proyas then wrote, directed and produced the 1998 science fiction thriller &quot;Dark City&quot;, which received positive critical reception and won several awards but was a commercial disappointment. In 2004, he directed &quot;I, Robot&quot; starring Will Smith, a science fiction film suggested by the Isaac Asimov short story compilation &quot;I, Robot&quot; and was a box office success despite mixed reviews.

Proyas&#x27; next film, the thriller &quot;Knowing&quot; starring Nicolas Cage, began production in Melbourne in March 2008 and opened in North America in March 2009.

Proyas directed &quot;Gods of Egypt&quot;, starring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and co-written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. The film was critically panned upon its release in 2016 and bombed at the box office.

In 2019, Proyas founded a production company in Sydney called The Heretic Foundation.

In 2021, Proyas announced that he was developing a new video platform named VidiVerse for independent filmmakers as an alternative to YouTube.

In 2024, Proyas began filming R.U.R. a musical adaptation of the play of the same name by Karel ƒåapek.

<doc id="314445" wikidata="Q869340" url="?curid=314445" title="William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield">
<text>William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, (2 March 1705 ‚Äì 20 March 1793), was a British judge, politician, lawyer, and peer best known for his reforms to English law. Born in Scone Palace, Perthshire, to a family of Scottish nobility, he was educated in Perth before moving to London at the age of 13 to study at Westminster School. Accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, in May 1723, Mansfield graduated four years later and returned to London, where he was called to the Bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in November 1730 and quickly gained a reputation as an excellent barrister.

He became involved in British politics in 1742, beginning with his election to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge and appointment as Solicitor General. In the absence of a strong Attorney General, Mansfield became the main spokesman for the government in the House of Commons, where he was noted for his &quot;great powers of eloquence&quot; and was described as &quot;beyond comparison the best speaker&quot;. With the promotion of Sir Dudley Ryder to Lord Chief Justice in 1754, Mansfield became Attorney General and, when Ryder unexpectedly died several months later, he took his place as Chief Justice.

As the most powerful British jurist of the 18th century, Mansfield&#x27;s decisions reflected the Age of Enlightenment and moved the country onto the path to abolishing slavery. He advanced commercial law in ways that helped establish Britain as world leader in industry, finance, and trade; modernised both English law and England&#x27;s courts; rationalised the system for submitting motions, and reformed the way judgments were delivered to reduce expense for the parties. For his work in &quot;Carter v Boehm&quot; and &quot;Pillans v Van Mierop&quot;, Mansfield has been called the founder of English commercial law. 

Mansfield is also known for his judgment in &quot;Somerset v Stewart&quot; where he held that slavery had no basis in common law and had never been established by positive law in England, and therefore was not binding in law. Though the judgement did not explicitly outlaw slavery in either England or British colonies, it played an important role in the early stages of the British abolitionist movement and inspired challenges to slavery on both sides of the Atlantic.

==Early life and education==

Murray was born on 2 March 1705, at Scone Palace in Perthshire, Scotland, the fourth son of David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont and his wife Margaret as one of eleven children. Both his parents were strong supporters of the Jacobite cause, and his older brother James followed the &quot;Old Pretender&quot; into exile, this left the family&#x27;s finance relatively impoverished. The Jacobite sympathies of Murray&#x27;s family were glossed over by contemporaries, who claimed that he had been educated at Lichfield Grammar School with many other members of the English judiciary. This was incorrect, as Murray was educated at Perth Grammar School, where he was taught Latin, English grammar, and essay writing skills. He later said that this gave him a great advantage at university, as those students educated in England had been taught Greek and Latin but not how to write properly in English. While at Perth Grammar School, it became apparent that Murray was particularly intelligent. In 1718, his father and older brother, James, decided to send him to Westminster School as James knew the Dean, Francis Atterbury.Thirteen year old Murray travelled alone with a pony given by his father, The distance from Perth to London was around , and the journey took Murray 54 days. Murray flourished at Westminster and was made a King&#x27;s Scholar on 21 May 1719.

After an examination in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored higher in the examination than any other King&#x27;s Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June. The records say that he came from Bath rather than Perth, as the person recording the names of the new students was unable to understand his Scottish accent. His older brother, James, was an advocate in Scotland (the Scottish equivalent of a barrister in England), and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish Bar at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray ¬£200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and he became a member of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 23 April 1724.

After George I died on 11 June 1727, Murray entered and won a competition to write a Latin poem titled &quot;The Death of the King&quot;. His actions were seen as a show of support for the House of Hanover and the political &quot;status quo&quot;, something odd considering the strong Jacobite sympathies of his family. He probably did this because, having no private income, he wished to secure patronage to help him advance politically. Another entrant was William Pitt, who was a constant rival to Murray until Pitt&#x27;s death in 1778. There is very little information about Murray&#x27;s time at Oxford. It is known that he studied ancient and modern history, became fluent in French, and gained a good understanding of Roman Law. He also became fluent in Latin, translating Cicero&#x27;s works into English and then back into Latin. He gained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1727, and travelled to London to train as a barrister.

==Family life==

Murray married Lady Elizabeth Finch, youngest daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham and 7th Earl of Winchilsea and Anne Hatton. They had no children of their own, but took care of their great niece, Lady Elizabeth Murray (born 1760), the daughter of Mansfield&#x27;s nephew and heir, David Murray, 7th Viscount Stormont, after her mother died. When Mansfield&#x27;s other nephew, Sir John Lindsay, returned to Britain in 1765 following the Seven Years&#x27; War and his assignment in the West Indies, he brought his illegitimate daughter, Dido, whose mother, Maria Bell, was an enslaved woman of African descent. Dido was born into slavery in 1761. Dido Elizabeth Belle was baptized November 1766 in London, 8 months after Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s arrival. It has been hypothesized that Mansfield took Dido in to provide grieving Lady Elizabeth with a companion who would later be her personal attendant.

Mansfield also helped mentor his nephew and heir, David Murray, 7th Viscount Stormont. Later, his nieces and unmarried sisters of Lord Stormont, Lady Anne and Lady Marjory Murray, would come to live at Kenwood to care for Lord and Lady Mansfield in their old age.

==At the English bar==
Murray&#x27;s first contact when he moved to London was William Hamilton, a Scottish-born barrister who was said to be the first Scot to practise at the English Bar, and one of the few people who was qualified to act as a barrister in both England and Scotland. Hamilton had been one of Murray&#x27;s sponsors when he joined Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1724 and, when Murray came to London, Hamilton helped find him a set of barristers&#x27; chambers at No. 1 Old Square. There was no formal legal education at this time, and the only requirement for a person to be called to the Bar was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and to have read the first sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward. Thus, most of Murray&#x27;s practical training came from reading the papers in Hamilton&#x27;s chambers, and listening to Lord Raymond speak in court along with tutoring by Thomas Denison on how to write special pleadings. Murray also studied various texts, including the French &quot;Ordinance de la Marine&quot; (a predecessor to the Napoleonic Commercial Code), the works of Bracton and Littleton, and &quot;crabbed and uncouth compositions&quot; on municipal law.

Murray was called to the Bar on 23 November 1730, taking a set of chambers at 5 King&#x27;s Bench Walk. He was introduced to Alexander Pope around this time, and through his friendship met members of the aristocracy, some of whom later became his clients, including Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. Pope also taught him oratory, which helped him enormously in court. His first two cases were in the English Court of Sessions in 1733, where he was led by Charles Talbot and opposed by Philip Yorke. The support of Talbot and Yorke allowed him to gain a respectable practice in the Court of Chancery.

Murray used his first professional earnings to purchase a china and silver-plate tea set for his kind sister in-law, Lady Stormont (mother of his nephew David Murray, 7th Viscount Stormont). Lady Stormont may have provided Murray with some financial support while he was a law student, on top of sending him food packages, including his favorite Scottish marmalade, when he was a young lawyer.

The 1707 Acts of Union had merged the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into one national entity, but they retained separate legal systems. However, the House of Lords became the highest court of appeal in both English and Scottish law and, as a result, from 1707 Scottish cases on appeal from the Court of Session were sent there. A barrister had to be familiar with both Scottish and English law to deal with these cases, and Murray found his niche acting in Scottish cases in the House of Lords as early as 1733. His work in &quot;Moncrieff v Moncrieff&quot; in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords Cowper and Parker. After &quot;Moncrieff&quot;, Murray was involved in almost every case in the House of Lords, whether it had been appealed from a Scottish court or not.

In 1737, Murray acted as Counsel for the City of Edinburgh in the aftermath of the death of Captain John Porteous. In Edinburgh, it was traditional for criminals sentenced to death to be allowed to visit a church near the city jail the Sunday before the execution. Two criminals named Wilson and Robertson took this as an opportunity to escape; although Wilson did not make it out of the church, Robertson escaped completely. Wilson had been a smuggler who supplied his fellow citizens with goods and, because of this and the unpopularity of the city guard, public opinion was firmly on his side. Porteous was the captain of the Edinburgh city guard, and was angry with Wilson&#x27;s attempt to escape and aware of the possibility of an attempt to free him. Porteous ordered a guard of 80 men to be placed around the gallows for Wilson&#x27;s execution. When a man attempted to cut Wilson&#x27;s body down after the execution, Porteous ordered his troops to fire on the crowd, and seven people were killed. Porteous was initially sentenced to death for murder and, when the execution was delayed, a mob of citizens rushed the city jail and lynched him.

As a result, a bill was proposed in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much that, by the time it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray&#x27;s reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.

On 20 September 1738, he married Lady Elizabeth Finch, the daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, 7th Earl of Winchilsea and Anne Hatton, at Raby Castle, home of her sister Duchess of Cleveland in Durham. Her other sisters included Charlotte Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, Mary Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe, and Lady Mary who was married to Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Marquess of Rockingham. Some of the aristocrats thought that the bride had married way below her status, and they also accused the groom (at the time just Mr. Murray) of social climbing into one of the great English families which the Finches belonged to. Indeed, Mansfield&#x27;s marriage helped him be accepted by the highest level of the aristocracy. Murray&#x27;s connection with the Marquess of Rockingham especially had a significant positive influence on his future career. After a short holiday, Murray returned to his work as a barrister.

==Member of Parliament==

Murray had repeatedly refused to become a Member of Parliament, saying he had no interest in politics. In 1742, however, the government of Sir Robert Walpole fell, and Murray&#x27;s brother-in-law, Daniel Finch, 8th Earl of Winchilsea, became First Lord of the Admiralty in the new Cabinet. With this added political influence, Murray hoped to be appointed to a government office, and when Sir John Strange resigned as Solicitor General, Murray was made a Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge on 15 December 1742 and immediately succeeded Strange as Solicitor General.

Although the Solicitor General was the lowest legal appointment, a successful one could be appointed Attorney General, and by custom, the Attorney General was allowed to become Lord Chief Justice if a vacancy arose. Although many barristers were not good politicians, Murray became a successful Member of Parliament, and one noted for his oratorical skills and logical arguments.

In 1745, Murray defended the actions of the government in hiring 16,000 Hanoverian troops to help fight in the War of the Austrian Succession. His argument (that it was the prerogative of the King to decide how a war should be fought, and he should not be second-guessed by politicians with no experience of warfare) defeated the motion to cease employing the Hanoverian troops by 231 votes to 181. Murray became popular with both the government and George II as a result, and in the absence of a strong Attorney General, Murray spoke for the government in most matters. In 1747, he helped Lord Hardwicke write and pass an act to abolish the old hereditary positions in Scotland. In 1751 he drafted the government response to an attempt by Frederick the Great of Prussia to frustrate neutral shipping, which William Scott, 1st Baron Stowell called &quot;the foundation of the modern law of neutrality&quot;, and Montesquieu described it as a &quot;r√©sponse sans r√©plique&quot; (response without a reply).

The death of Frederick, Prince of Wales, the heir to the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused constitutional chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, as Regent (since the heir apparent, Prince George, was only a child), while the public favoured the child&#x27;s mother Princess Augusta. In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta was to be a regent along with a council of others, and that George would become the heir when he reached maturity. Murray made a speech supporting the government&#x27;s proposal, but despite this, Parliament was not convinced that a council was necessary.

On 6 March 1754, the Prime Minister Henry Pelham died, and this necessitated a Cabinet reshuffle. The Attorney General, Sir Dudley Ryder, became Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, and Murray became Attorney General in his place. A few months later the Master of the Rolls died, and Murray was asked to replace him; he declined, however, as he &quot;did not want to leave His Majesty&#x27;s service&quot;. After Ryder died unexpectedly on 25 May 1756, however, Murray could not turn down the opportunity, and immediately applied to replace him as Lord Chief Justice.

He was accepted, and although his appointment delighted Murray, the government was very concerned at the loss of a good Attorney General. In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne offered him the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra ¬£6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.

This was seen as an excellent result by Murray, who had no interest in politics except as a stepping stone to become a member of the judiciary. Murray was not suited to politics, as he was far too calculating and independent of thought to accept any one party&#x27;s doctrine. His Scottish and Jacobite roots also allowed for endless insinuation and controversy‚Äîin 1753 he was accused by James Johnson Bishop of Gloucester of &quot;having drunk the health of the Old Pretender on his knees&quot;. Although the story was proven to be false, it embarrassed Murray, and was used to taunt him as late as 1770. His rivalry with William Pitt highlighted his unsuitability for politics‚Äîunlike such other politicians as Philip Yorke and Edward Thurlow, he did not have the temperament to resist &quot;the vehemence of Pitt&#x27;s invective&quot;. It was widely felt that he could have become Prime Minister after the death of Henry Pelham, but it would have &quot;set [his genius] in a false environment&quot;, and he declined all opportunities to return to politics except as Lord Chief Justice.

==Lord Chief Justice==

Anyone wishing to become a judge was required to be a Serjeant-at-law, which Murray was not; as such, he left Lincoln&#x27;s Inn to join Serjeant&#x27;s Inn. He qualified as a Serjeant-at-law on 8 November 1756, and was sworn in as Lord Chief Justice at the house of the Lord Chancellor that evening. Immediately afterwards he was created Baron Mansfield.

On 19 November, he was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor. He suspended his duties temporarily on 5 April 1757, when appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, due to an old custom that the Lord Chief Justice took the position when it was empty. He only served until 8 April, and there is no evidence of his performing anything more than the standard day-to-day duties. He became a cabinet minister in 1757, still serving as Lord Chief Justice, and stayed until 1765.

===Reform===
Mansfield first sat in court on 11 November 1756, and at the time had &quot;a very low estimate of the Common Law of England which he was to administer&quot;. The legal system had been put together in the period immediately after the Norman conquest of England, and was completely unsuited to the 18th century, when Britain was &quot;the greatest manufacturing and commercial country in the world&quot;. Mansfield immediately began to reform the way the law and courts worked. One of his first acts as Lord Chief Justice was to change the system for submitting motions. Every day the court was in session, all barristers were invited to submit motions, in order of their seniority as barristers. Because they were allowed to submit as many motions as they wanted, by the time junior barristers were allowed to submit their motions, it was normally the end of the day. This meant that almost all the work went to the senior barristers, who were so overworked that they often did not have time to prepare properly before going to court. In addition it meant that work for junior barristers was scarce, hindering their careers. Mansfield changed the system so that barristers were allowed to submit only one motion a day, and if not all barristers had been heard by the end of the day, they could continue where they left off the next morning.

At the time it was also traditional for all judgments to be reserved. Although in a small number of cases this was useful, in the majority of cases it simply made coming to court more expensive and wasted time. As soon as Mansfield became Lord Chief Justice, he changed the rules so that, unless the court had doubts over the evidence presented to them, a judgment was to be made immediately. This had a far-reaching effect on the English courts. Judges from the Court of Appeal and High Court of Justice now give reserved judgments in only a minority of cases. His reforms led to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench becoming one of the most active courts, at the expense of the Court of Common Pleas, which was described as the &quot;sleepy hollow&quot;.

===Mercantile law changes===
In the eighteenth century, English merchant law was still based on the &quot;Lex mercatoria&quot;, a medieval series of customs and principles used to regulate trading. Other countries in Europe had reformed and modernised their law, resulting in English merchant law being about a century behind mercantile law of other European countries. A merchant was, by his very nature, international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.

Mansfield made a great effort to bring English merchant law up to the same standards as that of other European nations, defining his position by saying that &quot;the daily negotiations and property of merchants ought not to depend on subtleties and niceties, but upon rules easily learned and easily retained because they are dictates of common sense drawn from the truth of the case&quot;. In most European countries, the principle was that a merchant was bound by his promises, not just his signed legal documents, while English lawyers maintained that a merchant could only be legally bound by documents that he signed. The European principle was based on the assumption of good faith on the part of the merchants, or &quot;uberrima fides&quot;, something completely lacking in English law. In &quot;Carter v Boehm&quot;, Mansfield got a chance to reform the law relating to the assumption of good faith. Carter was the Governor of Fort Marlborough (now Bengkulu), which was built by the British East India Company in Sumatra. He took out an insurance policy with Boehm against the fort&#x27;s being taken by a foreign enemy. A witness called Captain Tryon testified that Carter knew the fort was built to resist attacks from natives but not European enemies, and the French were likely to attack. The French did attack, and Boehm refused to fulfil the insurance claim.

Mansfield decided in favour of Boehm, saying that Carter had failed his duty of &quot;uberrima fides&quot;. In his judgment Mansfield said that:

This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law, and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use &quot;uberrima fides&quot;), it is still used in insurance contracts. In insurance agreements, the insuree inevitably knows more about the risk involved than the insurer; without the requirement for pre-contractual &quot;good faith&quot;, the insuree would have no reason to tell the truth, and insurance companies would be loath to make contracts.

In the earlier case of &quot;Pillans &amp; Rose v Van Mierop &amp; Hopkins&quot;, Mansfield had tried to challenge the doctrine of consideration. In English law, consideration is a vital part of the contract; without valid consideration, almost any contract is void. But, Mansfield argued in his judgment that it should only be treated as evidence of a contract, not as a vital element. Mansfield failed to make clear that he was referring only to consideration in commercial contracts, not general contracts, and as a result his judgment read that consideration was not required for &quot;any&quot; contract. His judgment has been much criticised by legal academics, and was effectively overruled by the House of Lords in &quot;Rann v Hughes&quot; [1778] 7 T. R. 350.

Mansfield also enforced a previous judgement of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench made in 1645, in which they allowed a special jury of merchants to sit in cases involving commercial law. He built up a special corps of these jurymen, some of whom, such as Edward Vaux, became noted experts on commercial law. &quot;Lord Mansfield&#x27;s jurymen&quot; acted as an effective liaison between the merchants and the courts. Mansfield was personally a supporter of free trade who was heavily influenced by Roman law and ancient Roman and Greek writers such as Cicero and Xenophon.

In 1783, Mansfield heard the case of , regarding the payment of an insurance claim for slaves killed when thrown overboard by the captain of a slave-ship ‚Äì an event now known as the &quot;Zong&quot; massacre. Mansfield, in summing up the jury&#x27;s verdict, said &quot;The Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses had been thrown over board&quot;, and endeavoured to uphold the notion that slaves were property which could be destroyed in situations of &quot;absolute necessity&quot;. But, new information was introduced in the case, and he ruled against the owners of the ship. In doing this, he achieved his aim of preventing maritime insurance law from becoming more complicated.

===Copyright law===
Mansfield made another notable judgment in , in relation to copyright law. Andrew Millar was a bookseller who in 1729 had purchased the publishing rights to James Thomson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;. After the term of the exclusive rights granted under the Statute of Anne expired, Robert Taylor began publishing his own competing publication, which contained Thomson&#x27;s poem. Mansfield, sitting with three other judges, concluded that despite the Statute of Anne there was a perpetual common law copyright, and therefore that no works can ever be considered public domain. This was a massive victory for booksellers and publishers, as it meant that they could effectively make it impossible for new companies to compete, as in the absence of new texts, there was nothing they could print. Mansfield&#x27;s judgment was finally overruled by the House of Lords in &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot; in 1774.

Mansfield&#x27;s judgment has been criticised as being unusually short-sighted because he failed to see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This was one of only a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield&#x27;s judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.

===Junius===
In 1695 Parliament failed to renew the Licensing Acts, and as a result, the press were free to print material attacking the government. Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded. Despite the freedom of the press from pre-censorship by the government, the judiciary regularly tried people for seditious libel if they printed material attacking the government. From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of Junius were published in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, a London newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall. In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including John Manners, Marquess of Granby and Mansfield. As his letters were wildly popular, the circulation of the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; doubled in just five months.

On 19 December 1769, Junius wrote a letter attacking the King, and incensed at this, the government ordered several people to be arrested and tried for seditious libel, including Woodfall for publishing the letters, John Almon for selling them, and John Miller for republishing them. Almon&#x27;s case was heard at Westminster Hall by Mansfield and a jury on 2 June 1770. He was found guilty, although it is unclear in what fashion he was punished, if at all. Woodfall was tried on 13 June 1770, by Mansfield and a jury. While Mansfield believed that the language used was libellous, the jury disagreed, and held that he was &quot;guilty of printing and publishing only&quot;, and innocent of seditious libel. Miller was tried on 13 July 1770, and after six hours of discussion, the jury found him innocent. As a result of these two trials, it became clear that no jury would convict a printer for printing these letters, leaving Junius free to continue publishing them.

On 14 November 1770, a letter by Junius directed at Mansfield was published by the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; and the &quot;London Evening Post&quot;, a newspaper run by John Miller. In it, Junius attacked Mansfield, first for being Scottish, then for being a lapsed Jacobite, and finally for attempting to suppress the freedom of the press. In a response to Junius&#x27; letter dated 16 November 1770, Mansfield made the following threat:

Although the Attorney General, William de Grey, advised that the publishers should again be prosecuted, Mansfield disagreed, saying that if they failed to respond to Junius, he would become bored and stop writing. Mansfield was evidently correct, because other than a letter printed on 5 October 1771, Junius ceased to write at the beginning of 1772.

===Somersett&#x27;s Case===

Mansfield is best known for his judgment in Somersett&#x27;s Case on the legality of keeping slaves in England. The English had been involved in the slave trade since 1553, and by 1768, ships registered in Liverpool, Bristol and London carried more than half the slaves shipped in the world. James Somersett was a slave owned by Charles Stewart, an American customs officer who sailed to Britain for business, landing on 10 November 1769. A few days later Somersett attempted to escape. He was recaptured in November and imprisoned on the ship &quot;Ann and Mary&quot;, owned by Captain John Knowles and bound for the British colony of Jamaica. Stewart intended to sell him there. However, three people claiming to be Somersett&#x27;s godparents, John Marlow, Thomas Walkin and Elizabeth Cade, made an application before the Court of King&#x27;s Bench for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, and Captain Knowles was ordered to produce Somersett before the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, which would determine whether his imprisonment was legal.

Mansfield ordered a hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, the case was not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had attracted a great deal of attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett&#x27;s real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.

On behalf of Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither the common law of England, nor any law made by Parliament recognised the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal. Moreover, English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person&#x27;s consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles. A law passed in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown, which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery. When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract for the sale of a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.

After the attorneys for both sides had given their arguments, Mansfield called a recess, saying that &quot;[the case] required ... [a] consultation ... among the twelve Judges&quot;. Finally, on 22 June 1772 Mansfield gave his judgment, which ruled that a master could not carry his slave out of England by force, and concluded:
The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it&#x27;s so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.
This was not an end to slavery, as this only confirmed it was illegal to transport a slave out of England and Wales against his or her will. Slavery also persisted in the rest of the British Empire. As a result of the reporting of Mansfield&#x27;s decision, public opinion and some newspapers gave the impression that slavery had been abolished by the ruling. Some historians believe that between 14,000 and 15,000 slaves were immediately freed in England, some of whom remained with their masters as paid or unpaid employees. However, it is questionable whether that many black people lived in England at the time, and most of them were already free men and women, or were runaway slaves who had evaded the authorities. The decision was vague enough to allow Africans to still be hunted and kidnapped in London, Liverpool and Bristol to be sold elsewhere. (Such an incident was recounted by Olaudah Equiano in 1774 in his autobiography, &quot;An Interesting Narrative&quot; (1789).)

Mansfield believed that his decision meant that slavery continued, because his mixed-race great-niece Dido Elizabeth Belle remained a slave in his household, until his 1793 will allowed her to be considered a free woman. (She had been born into slavery as the illegitimate daughter of his nephew in the West Indies but lived with him and his wife for 30 years.) In addition, advertisements from the 1770s show that slaves continued to be bought and sold in England. Mansfield referred to slaves in his judgment in a later case. Although slavery was not completely abolished in the British Empire until 1834, Mansfield&#x27;s decision is considered to have been a significant step in recognising the illegality of slavery.

==Lord Mansfield&#x27;s Rule==
Lord Mansfield is frequently mentioned in modern legal settings as the originator of &quot;Lord Mansfield&#x27;s Rule&quot;, in his own words: &quot;the law of England is clear, that the declarations of a father or mother, cannot be admitted to bastardize the issue born after marriage.&quot; This quote comes from Mansfield&#x27;s appellate decision in &quot;Goodright v Moss&quot;. The primary legal question in the case was not this preexisting principle, which applies only to children &quot;born after marriage&quot;, but rather whether the child had been born before the marriage. The question was whether statements the child&#x27;s parents allegedly made before their deaths could be introduced as evidence that the child had been born before their marriage and was thus illegitimate. Mansfield ruled to admit the testimony against the child&#x27;s legitimacy and grant a new trial. The term &quot;Lord Mansfield&#x27;s Rule&quot; is often used in a slightly different sense to denote the principle still applied in several jurisdictions that marriage creates a conclusive presumption of a husband&#x27;s paternity of his wife&#x27;s child.

==House of Lords==
After the formation of the Fox-North Coalition, Mansfield agreed to act as Speaker of the House of Lords, taking up his post in February 1783. The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the East India Bill, which provoked bitter arguments in both the House of Lords and House of Commons. In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the Woolsack the next day. The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.

Mansfield had been made earl of Mansfield, in the County of Nottingham, on 31 October 1776. He attended the Lords as Lord Speaker, and the last record of him attending (other than his presence at the state opening of Parliament on 23 March 1784) was in December 1783.

==Retirement and death==

Despite failing health, Mansfield refused to officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III was opposed to the appointment of Mansfield&#x27;s prot√©g√© Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned. The government of the time instead suggested Lloyd Kenyon as a possible successor. Mansfield clung to office until 1788 (despite not sitting in court for two years), in the hope that the government would fall before he was forced to retire. This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.

Mansfield spent the remainder of his life at Kenwood House looked after by his nieces Lady Anne and Lady Marjory Murray and Dido Belle. Most of his time was spent maintaining the grounds. When Fanny Burney visited Kenwood in June 1792, she was unable to see Lord Mansfield, because he was too infirm and had not been downstairs for four years, she asked after Miss Murrays and left her respects but &quot;Miss Murrays were upstairs with Lord Mansfield, whom they never left&quot;.

In the summer, he was visited by groups of barristers who informed him of the goings-on at court. On 1 August 1792 he was made earl of Mansfield, in the County of Middlesex. On 10 March 1793, he complained of feeling sleepy, and although he recovered the next day, by 12 March, he was again complaining of a need for sleep. He went to bed early and remained asleep until 18 March, when he finally died. His body was buried in the north transept of Westminster Abbey. His monument at Westminster was commissioned by his nephew David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield. It was sculpted by John Flaxman (by suggestion of Sir William Hamilton).

Mansfield left a large amount of money after his death, including an estate worth ¬£500,000 to his nephew now the 2nd Earl. He also gave ¬£2,000 to Francis Buller.

==Legacy==
English law saw significant changes during Mansfield&#x27;s career. As lord chief justice, Mansfield had done much to reform the way the courts worked, making it easier for people to gain access to legal aid, and also making the process much less expensive. He was also noted for his insistence that equity should be applied by all courts, not just the Court of Chancery, a view that provoked much disagreement during his lifetime, but was eventually confirmed by Parliament in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which allowed all courts to take cases of equity. He also established the principle that rather than blindly following precedent, judges should seek to find loopholes in rules that were no longer applicable, something that later received the support of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who said, &quot;It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is more revolting still if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.&quot; He made his judgements on the principle that &quot;as the usages of society alter, the law must adapt itself to the various situations of mankind&quot;, leading John Baker to describe him as &quot;one of the boldest of judicial spirits&quot;.

His most important contributions were to commercial, merchant and common law. Mansfield spent much time bringing the law of England on par with that of other countries, particularly in cases such as &quot;Pillans &amp; Rose v Van Mierop &amp; Hopkins&quot; [1765] 3 Burr 1663, and &quot;Carter v Boehm&quot; [1766] 3 Burr 1905. As a result of his work, he was described by a later judge as &quot;the founder of the commercial law of this country&quot;.

He was, however, criticised for his resistance to the freedom of the press and his refusal to go against the King, as well as for blatant nepotism‚Äîhighlighted by his attempts to have Francis Buller made Lord Chief Justice after his retirement. He was also criticised as a politician for his support of a government antagonistic to the colonies; in 1829 John Quincy Adams described him as &quot;more responsible for the Revolution than any other man&quot;. Scholars such as John Chipman Gray have questioned his reputation as a universally successful judge, saying that &quot;the reputation of Lord Mansfield as a commercial lawyer should not blind us to the fact that he was not equally great in the law of real property&quot;.

Opinion over Mansfield&#x27;s intention in his ruling in Somerset&#x27;s Case is mixed, with the current prevailing view being that he did not intend to free the slaves. The judgment was particularly narrow, as it ruled only that a master could not carry his slave out of England by force, not that slaves who came to England were emancipated. This is seen as particularly telling because this was the primary argument of Davy and Hargrave. If Murray had wanted to emancipate the slaves completely, there were various bits of judicial precedent he could have based his decision on, such as &quot;Smith v Gould&quot; or &quot;Shanley v Harvey&quot;, but he did not. Various comments he made before and during the case also suggest that complete emancipation was not his intent; in a preliminary judgment he said that &quot;the setting 14,000 or 15,000 men at once free loose by a solemn opinion, is much disagreeable in the effect it threatens&quot;, which one modern legal scholar interprets as indicative of his reluctance to make a decision for fear of economic consequences. Various comments he made to Thomas Hutchinson in private letters, along with his comments about the &quot;Somersett&quot; decision in &quot;R v Inhabitants of Thames Ditton&quot; also suggest that emancipation was not his goal. In the 1785 &quot;Inhabitants of Thames Ditton&quot; case, Lord Mansfield expressed the view that his ruling in the Somerset case decided only that a slave could not be forcibly removed from England against his will.

Mansfield and Lady Finch did not have any children. His title, which succeeds to this day, passed to his nephew, David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield.

==Honours==

Mansfield is immortalised in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament. 
*In 1801 a large marble monument to him by John Flaxman was installed in Westminster Abbey; it shows a seated Murray flanked by the personifications of Wisdom and Justice, with an inscription that reads:

*The town of Mansfield, Massachusetts was named after him. 
*Because of his reputation as a barrister, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn offer a series of scholarship for the Bar Vocational Course named the Lord Mansfield Scholarship.
*Mansfield has been portrayed as a character several times in television and film ‚Äì in &quot;The Fight Against Slavery&quot; (1975) by John Richmond, &quot;The British&quot; (2012) by Timothy West, &quot;Belle&quot; (2013) by Tom Wilkinson and &quot;The Scandalous Lady W&quot; (2015) by David Calder.

==Character==

Mansfield was noted at the Bar, in Parliament, and while sitting as a judge, for his eloquence and skill as a speaker; in particular Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield described him as &quot;beyond comparison the best speaker&quot; in the House of Commons. He was also a hard worker; he would sometimes do court paperwork himself, as well as do his judicial duties, in an attempt to speed up the legal process.

He was summarised by Gareth Jones as &quot;Conservative, urbane, silver-tongued, energetic, cultivated and well read; a highly imaginative lawyer who looked to reason and was not overawed by the legacy of the past&quot;. Edmund Burke, a contemporary, said that &quot;he had some superiors in force, some equals in persuasion; but in &quot;insinuation&quot; he was without a rival. He excelled in the statement of a case. This, of itself, was worth the argument of any other man&quot;. The comment by Samuel Johnson that &quot;Much may be made of a [Scotsman], if he be caught young&quot; was directed at Mansfield, and Johnson also described him as &quot;more than a mere lawyer&quot;, while Edward Coke, who is considered one of the most important lawyers in the history of English law, was &quot;only a lawyer&quot;.

Unlike other barristers, Mansfield was noted for always keeping a cool head and being &quot;prudent to the point of timidity&quot;. He was criticised for being &quot;moderate and dispassionate&quot;, unlike more aggressive barristers such as Edward Coke; when asked about this he replied that &quot;I would not have made Sir Edward Coke&#x27;s speech to gain all Sir Edward Coke&#x27;s estates and all his reputation&quot;. There are conflicting reports about his temperament and attitude as a judge; William Pitt described him as &quot;a very bad judge, proud, haughty to the Bar and hasty in his determinations&quot;, and Charles Yorke said he was &quot;offensive and unpopular&quot;. Both opinions are suspect, however; Pitt&#x27;s because he was a constant rival to Mansfield and Yorke&#x27;s because he was attempting to beat Mansfield to the position of Lord Chancellor at the time. Edward Foss said that &quot;there has never been a judge more venerated by his contemporaries, nor whose memory is regarded with greater respect and affection&quot;, and described him as &quot;the great oracle of law&quot;.

Mansfield has been called &quot;the legal genius of his generation&quot;, and compared favourably with Joseph Story, a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States noted for his brilliance. Other Americans such as Julian S. Waterman, the founder of the University of Arkansas School of Law, described him as &quot;not only the greatest common law judge but the greatest judge in Anglo-American legal history&quot;, while Joseph Story himself said that Mansfield &quot;broke down the narrow barrier of the common law, redeemed it from feudal selfishness and barbarity&quot; and that &quot;he was one of those great men raised up by Providence, at a fortunate moment, to effect a salutary revolution in the world&quot;.

<text>Ellesmere Port and Neston was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district with borough status in Cheshire, England. It covered the southern part of the Wirral Peninsula, namely that part which is not included in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral.

The district had a population of about 81,800 (2006 estimate). The main towns were Ellesmere Port and Neston as well as the village of Parkgate. It also included a number of villages such as Great Sutton and Willaston.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 by the merger of the borough of Ellesmere Port and the urban district of Neston. The district was originally called just Ellesmere Port, with the council changing the name in 1976. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government considered reorganising Cheshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The decision to merge Ellesmere Port and Neston with the districts of Chester and Vale Royal to create a single unitary authority was announced on 25 July 2007, following a consultation period in which a proposal to create a single Cheshire unitary authority was rejected.

Ellesmere Port and Neston was abolished on 31 March 2009, with the area becoming part of the new unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester from 1 April 2009.

==Civil parishes==
The entire borough was initially unparished. A civil parish of Ince was created in 1987, and a Neston parish was created in 2008.

==Political control==
The town of Ellesmere Port had been a municipal borough from 1955 to 1974 with a borough council. The first elections to the new Ellesmere Port Borough Council created under the Local Government Act 1972 were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was always held by the Labour Party:

===Leadership===
The first leader of the council, Fred Venables, had been the leader of the old Ellesmere Port Borough Council since 1970. The leaders of Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council were:

===Composition===
The political composition of the council at its abolition in 2009 was:

==Premises==

The council was based at the Ellesmere Port Council Offices at 4 Civic Way, Ellesmere Port, which had been built for the old borough council in 1969. Council meetings were held at nearby Whitby Hall until 1992 when an extension containing a council chamber was opened at the Municipal Buildings. Following the abolition of the council the Council Offices were used by its successor, Cheshire West and Chester Council, until 2022 when they were replaced by a new building called &quot;The Portal&quot; on Wellington Road.

<text>Neston is a market town and civil parish in Cheshire, England. It is within the part of the Wirral Peninsula that belongs to the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester. The built up area (as defined by the Office for National Statistics) includes Parkgate to the north west, and Little Neston and Ness to the south. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 15,392 and the built up area had a population of 14,960.

==History==
The name is of Viking origin, deriving from the Old Norse &quot;Nes-t√∫n&quot;, meaning &#x27;farmstead or settlement at/near a promontory or headland&#x27;.
Another Nesttun town can be found near Bergen, Norway.
It is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Nestone&quot; under the ownership of a William Fitznigel, with a population of eight households.
A market charter was granted to Neston in 1728, allowing the right to hold weekly markets and annual fairs.

===Port===
Neston was a major port before the River Dee silted up. The port was then shifted further downstream to the nearby village of Parkgate, although by early nineteenth century, most traffic had ultimately transferred to Liverpool.

===Mining===
Neston is also a former mining village with a small extension of the Flintshire Coalfield occurring on its southern edge. There were two periods during which coal seams within these coal measures rocks were mined.

Between 1759 and 1855 Ness Colliery worked using shafts largely clustered around the Harp Inn in today&#x27;s Little Neston. It was opened by John Stanley Massey, a member of the leading Stanley family of Hooton, in partnership with four others. Because of the local geology most working was carried out under the Dee Estuary. The mine was remarkable in using canals deep underground for boats to haul coal. It was also remarkable for blatant acts of sabotage committed by the Stanleys against a rival, neighbouring mine established in about 1820 by the Cottingham family; their mine went out of business in the 1840s. Due to exhaustion of many of the coal seams, and difficulty in transporting coal, Ness Colliery was closed in 1855.

The later period of mining started in 1875 with the establishment of Neston Colliery (later becoming Wirral Colliery). By this time the Chester and Birkenhead Railway had come to nearby Parkgate; a branch line to the colliery enabled coal to be shifted in bulk. The mine worked seams further north than those worked by Ness Colliery. Wirral colliery was taken over by the British government during the First World War. The pit subsequently returned to private ownership after the war, but increasing competition from larger mines brought about its closure in 1927 with a loss of 180 jobs.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Neston, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Neston Town Council and Cheshire West and Chester Council. The town council is based at Neston Town Hall on High Street. Neston is part of the parliamentary constituency of Chester North and Neston, currently represented by Labour MP Samantha Dixon.

===Administrative history===
Neston was an ancient parish in the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. The parish was subdivided into eight townships: Great Neston, Ledsham, Leighton, Little Neston, Ness, Raby, Thornton Hough, and Willaston. The town of Neston and the parish church of St Mary&#x27;s and St Helen&#x27;s were in the Great Neston township.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Neston, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the townships also became civil parishes.

A local government district called Neston and Parkgate was created in 1867, administered by an elected local board. It covered the three townships of Great Neston, Little Neston, and Leighton (the village of Parkgate straddled the Great Neston and Leighton townships). Neston Town Hall was completed in 1889 to provide a public hall for the town, and also incorporated the local board&#x27;s offices.

Local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The three civil parishes within the Neston and Parkgate district were also united into a single parish called Neston-cum-Parkgate in 1894. The urban district was enlarged in 1933 to take in the parishes of Burton, Ness, and Willaston, and there was also some adjustment to the boundaries with other neighbouring areas. At the same time, the urban district was renamed from &#x27;Neston and Parkgate&#x27; to just &#x27;Neston&#x27;.

Neston Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston. No successor parish was created for the former urban district, and so it became unparished, being directly administered by Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council. In 2009, Cheshire West and Chester Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished. A new civil parish of Neston was created in 2009 alongside the wider changes that year, with its parish council adopting the name Neston Town Council. The parish created in 2009 covers a smaller area than the pre-1974 urban district of Neston, notably excluding Burton and Willaston.

==Geography==
Neston is at the southern end of the Wirral Peninsula, on the eastern bank of the Dee Estuary.

==Transport==

The A540 road links Neston to Heswall and West Kirby to the north, and Cheshire, Chester and North Wales to the south. Neston is also close to the M53 and M56 motorways, giving it access to Liverpool, Manchester, and the larger M6 motorway.

Neston railway station is situated on the Borderlands Line, providing direct services southbound to Flintshire and Wrexham, and northbound to Bidston, with connecting services to the Merseyrail network between West Kirby and Liverpool. In 2008, Merseytravel investigated the possibility of linking up the Bidston ‚Äì Wrexham line to the electrified Merseyrail system.

==Community==

===Local area===
Neston is considered a desirable place to live, with its many independent shops, cafes and bars. It is also within walking distance to nearby Parkgate, as well as links to countryside walks and the Wirral Way.

===Places of interest===
One of the main local attractions is Ness Botanic Gardens, opened in 1898 and administered by the University of Liverpool.

===Events===
Neston hosts a weekly market every Friday, offering local produce including fruit and vegetables, meat, fish, cheese and baked goods.

On the first Thursday of June, Neston annually celebrates Ladies Club Day (known colloquially as Ladies Club). This is a unique marching day that has links to the Neston Female Friendly Society during the Napoleonic War.

===Education===
Neston High School serves the local secondary age students.

===Neston Market Town Initiative===
From 2006, Neston underwent an assessment to attract more income and tourists, in the form of the Neston Market Initiative (NMTI).
The project also included the launch of a new community website. The NMTI involved improving the &#x27;look&#x27; of the town centre (including new shop fronts) and controversial plans for a new supermarket on the site of Brook Street car park. Work for the new supermarket began in March 2009 with a full archaeological dig being carried out on the car park site before construction work began. Work to excavate the site began in August 2009, resulting in the removal of 28,000 cubic metres of earth to allow for the construction of a multi storey car park. The new Sainsbury&#x27;s store was opened on 1 December 2010.

On 31 March 2008 the Neston Market Town Initiative project was officially completed. The community regeneration was to have been continued by CH64Inc, a new local community association, but it was not supported by Ellesmere Port and Neston Council or the successor authority, Cheshire West and Chester Council and was closed.

==Sport==

The Neston Club is located in Parkgate and is home to Neston Cricket Club, who play in the Cheshire County Cricket ECB Premier League. 
Neston Hockey Club is also based on the same site. 
Club members have access to a clubhouse, tennis courts, bowls, squash, racketball and fitness classes including yoga and pilates.

Neston Nomads Football Club, established 1983, play their home games at the fields adjacent Neston High School that are part of the school premises. The first team currently play in the West Cheshire 3rd Division.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. With its close proximity to North Wales, BBC Wales and ITV Cymru Wales can also be received from the Moel-y-Parc TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Merseyside on 95.8 FM, Capital North West &amp; Wales on 97.1 FM, Heart North West on 105.4 FM, Smooth Radio North West on 100.4 FM, and Dee Radio on 106.3 FM.

The town is served by the local newspapers &quot;Wirral News&quot; and &quot;Chester and District Standard&quot;.

<doc id="314449" wikidata="Q26114" url="?curid=314449" title="Eurasian woodcock">
<text>The Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) is a medium-small wading bird found in temperate and subarctic Eurasia. It has cryptic camouflage to suit its woodland habitat, with reddish-brown upperparts and buff-coloured underparts. Its eyes are set far back on its head to give it 360-degree vision and it probes in the ground for food with its long, sensitive bill, making it vulnerable to cold weather when the ground remains frozen.

The male performs a courtship flight known as &quot;roding&quot; at dusk in spring. It is widely believed that the female will sometimes carry chicks between her legs whilst flying, though evidence of this is purely anecdotal. The world population is estimated to be 14 million to 16 million birds.

==Taxonomy==

The Eurasian woodcock was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Scolopax rusticola&quot;. The genus name is Latin for a snipe or woodcock. The specific epithet &quot;rusticola&quot; is the Latin name of a gamebird mentioned by Pliny the Elder and Marcus Valerius Martialis. It was possibly a grouse. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Its closest relatives are the other woodcocks in the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot;.

==Description==
Adults are in length, including the long straight bill, and have a wingspan. The Eurasian woodcock has cryptic camouflage to suit its woodland habitat, with intricately patterned reddish-brown upperparts and buff underparts. The head is barred with black, not striped like that of its close relatives, the snipe. It has large eyes located high on the sides of its head, giving it 360-degree monocular vision.

The wings are rounded and the base of the bill is flesh-coloured with a dark tip. The legs vary from grey to pinkish. The species is sexually dimorphic, with the male much larger than the female, although the sexes cannot be separated in the field.

==Distribution and habitat==
About one third of the world&#x27;s Eurasian woodcock breed in Europe, with more than 90% of the continent&#x27;s population breeding in Russia and Fennoscandia. Their breeding range stretches from Fennoscandia to the Mediterranean Sea and Canary Islands and from western Europe to Russia. The population on the Azores is isolated from mainland Europe, resulting in subtle genetic differentiation.

This species is the woodcock found through most of temperate and subarctic Eurasia. Northern and Asian populations migrate to southern Europe or the Indian Subcontinent, respectively. Birds in milder western European countries and on Atlantic islands are resident. The populations breeding in north-west and southern Europe are mostly sedentary. The birds&#x27; spring migration commences in February; breeding territories are reached between March and May. Spring migration movements of woodcock are influenced by weather conditions, however this does not have a major effect on their subsequent breeding success.
The Eurasian woodcock has a large range, with an estimated Global Extent of Occurrence of 10 million square kilometres and a population of an estimated 15 million to 16 million birds. Because of its large range, stable population trend and large population size, the species has been evaluated as Least Concern. The most important threat to the population of the Eurasian woodcock in the breeding range is the increased fragmentation of its woodland habitat. At other times of year, a reduction in the amount of permanent grassland and an increase in the intensification of farming are also threats, and the species&#x27; susceptibility to avian influenza may have an impact in future.

The Eurasian woodcock&#x27;s required breeding habitat is large, unfragmented areas of broadleaved deciduous or mixed broadleaved and coniferous forest, with dense undergrowth of plants such as brambles, holly, hazel, gorse, bracken, or bilberry. On a small scale, Eurasian woodcock appear to prefer woods containing birch and were less likely to be found in beech dominated woods. They also prefer woods further away from urban areas. Breeding territories must include a mix of dry, warm resting places, damp areas for feeding, and clearings for flight. In larger woods, wide &quot;rides&quot; (open tracks through the wood) and small clearings are important. In winter, Eurasian woodcock also use scrubland during the day but in freezing weather they may use intertidal mud.

==Behaviour==
Eurasian woodcock are crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk) and rarely active during the day unless flushed, when they fly off with a whirring wing noise. The flight is somewhat owl- or bat-like; woodcock fly fast and directly while migrating or crossing open country, but fly erratically with twisting and fluttering once in woodland. They are usually solitary and migrate singly, but may congregate when weather or geographical conditions force them to do so. This species is parasitised by the moorhen flea, &quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot;.

===Breeding===

The male performs a courtship display flight called &#x27;roding&#x27; at dusk between April and June. A mating call is performed during courtship display flights: &quot;orr, orr, orr, pist&quot;. A study of spectrograms of the vocalisations of male Eurasian woodcock showed that 95% of calls could be attributed correctly to individual birds, and concluded that counting roding males was a suitable method of monitoring the population. Roding surveys are now used for population estimates in a range of countries including Britain, Switzerland, France and Russia.

Eurasian woodcock nest on the ground in low cover in woodland or tall heather. The nest is a lined cup or a slight hollow lined with dead leaves and other plant material. A single brood of one or two white or creamy eggs with light brown and grey blotches is laid; once the clutch is complete, incubation is performed by the female for between 21 and 24 days. The eggs measure and weigh , of which 5% is shell. The downy, precocial young leave the nest immediately and fledge after 15‚Äì20 days, although they can fly short distances after 10 days. When threatened, the mother bird can fly whilst carrying small chicks between her legs, body and tail, in her claws or on her back. This behaviour is rarely witnessed.

=== Food and feeding ===
Eurasian woodcock forage in soft soil in thickets, usually well hidden from sight. They mainly eat earthworms, but also insects and their larvae, freshwater molluscs and some plant seeds. Because they rely on probing into the ground to find food, they are vulnerable to cold winter weather when the ground remains frozen. During the cold British winter of 1962‚Äì63, starving woodcock were found feeding in urban areas and some were even forced to eat bird seed.

Nocturnal feeding occurs in frost-free pasture or long-rotation grass meadows; fields with woodland within are preferred to allow roosting during the day. There are only low densities of Eurasian woodcock in predominantly arable areas. In a three-year scientific study based in Brittany, France, 65 radio-tagged woodcock and their habitat preferences were monitored. During the day, the birds chose areas of forest with humus which held large numbers of earthworms and with a dense scrub layer to provide protection, and hedges with scrub and trees were also found to be important. At night, the woodcock selected grazed pastures which had five times the biomass of earthworms compared to tilled land.

==Relationship to humans==

===Hunting===
In many countries woodcock are hunted as game, and their size, speed, and flight pattern makes them a very challenging shot. Anyone shooting a witnessed &quot;right and left&quot;‚Äîin which two woodcock are killed with consecutive shots from a shotgun, without the gun being lowered or reloaded‚Äîcan be admitted to the &quot;Shooting Times&quot; Woodcock Club.

In 1821 William Bingley described a method of trapping Eurasian woodcock formerly used in northern England: &quot;Long parallel rows of stones or stick, four or five inches high, were made in moonlight nights on the commons frequented by them. In these rows several intervals or gateways were left in which the traps were placed. When the birds, running about in search of food, came to one of these rows, they did not usually cross it, but ran along the side till they arrived at the gateways, which they entered, and in which they were caught.&quot;

The effect of hunting on the species&#x27; European breeding population is &quot;little understood&quot;. A study conducted in Brittany, France, explored the factors affecting the populations of wintering Eurasian woodcock. The mortality and survival rates of 98 radio-tagged birds were monitored in a hunted area and in an adjoining hunting-free reserve. The scientists found rates of survival of 0.86 for adults and 0.67 for juveniles, with the probability of survival increasing as birds spent more time in the reserve. Matrix population models were used and the conclusion was that &quot;such low survival probabilities cannot sustain long-term viable populations. These results call for caution in the harvesting of woodcock populations wintering in western France and could be a forewarning of a decline.&quot;

In the United Kingdom, surveys are being conducted to improve knowledge of the number of breeding Eurasian woodcock and the structure of their habitat. Isotope analysis of feathers from Eurasian woodcock shot in the UK is also being performed to establish the origins of the birds.

===Gastronomy===
Eurasian woodcock are considered at their best for culinary purposes from October to December. After shooting, the birds are hung for 4‚Äì8 days to tenderise; the meat can be eaten as a starter, savoury, or for breakfast. A bird serves one person. They are not gutted before cooking; the head, skinned with eyes removed, is left on and the beak used to truss the bird.

A recipe for roast woodcock was featured in &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot;, but despite its name, the Victorian dish named Scotch woodcock consists of scrambled eggs on toast with anchovies.

Bingley wrote that (in the United Kingdom) &quot;Few birds are so much in esteem for the table as these&quot;, although he also reported that woodcock meat was not eaten in Sweden or Norway as it was thought unwholesome, but that the eggs were taken and sold in &quot;great numbers&quot; in Stockholm and Gothenburg. In Nicolas Freeling&#x27;s &quot;Kitchen Book&quot; he narrates the lavish dinner described in Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Sea Constables&quot;, which features woodcock as a savoury, and explains that &#x27;the woodcock has no gall, and is not cleaned [...] the creamy inside parts are spread on toast [...] no Edwardian gentleman would have resisted this for one minute.&#x27;

===Folklore and culture===
In the United Kingdom, the early arrival of migrant woodcock in autumn was said to mean a good harvest, especially if they stayed until spring. It used to be thought that Eurasian woodcock flew to the moon during the months when they were not seen and the first full moon in November, when large numbers arrive on the British coast, is sometimes described as the &#x27;woodcock moon&#x27;.

Reaney and Wilson wrote that the English surname &quot;Woodcock&quot; developed as a nickname from the bird, meaning &#x27;a fool, simpleton or dupe&#x27;.

In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot;, Berowne describes himself and his friends as &#x27;four woodcocks in a dish&#x27;, after discovering they have all fallen in love when they have sworn not to. An old folk name for the goldcrest was the &quot;woodcock pilot&quot; because of the mistaken belief that the warblers rode in the feathers of migrating woodcock. In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Polonius refers to Hamlet&#x27;s vows as &quot;springes to catch woodcocks&quot;.

The &#x27;pin feather&#x27; of the Eurasian woodcock (the covert feather of the outermost primary) can be used as a fine paintbrush for miniatures, or as a delicate tool for moving tiny objects (e.g. specks of dust). As a painting tool, the feather has been described as &quot;far from ideal, holding very little paint, resisting water and wearing down quickly at the tip.&quot; The Eurasian woodcock has been the subject of postage stamps from several countries.

A woodcock serves as a symbolic element in the novel &quot;The Birds&quot; by writer Tarjei Vesaas.

<doc id="314454" wikidata="Q1095618" url="?curid=314454" title="Clarissa Explains It All">
<text>Clarissa Explains It All is an American teen sitcom created by Mitchell Kriegman for Nickelodeon. In the series, Clarissa Darling (Melissa Joan Hart) is a teenager who addresses the audience directly to explain the things that are happening in her life, dealing with typical adolescent concerns such as school, boys, pimples, wearing her first training bra, and an annoying younger brother.

A total of 65 episodes were produced and aired from March 23, 1991, to October 1, 1994, with repeats airing until August 19, 2001. From August 1992 onwards, the series headlined the popular SNICK (Saturday Night Nickelodeon) lineup. Reruns of the show have appeared intermittently on TeenNick&#x27;s channel block The &#x27;90s Are All That, eventually NickRewind, from 2011 to 2020.

A pilot for a spin-off series was filmed titled &quot;Clarissa Now&quot;. It featured Clarissa as an intern at a newspaper in New York City. The pilot was not picked up, and aired once as a special on Nickelodeon.

In 2015, Kriegman released a novel, &quot;Things I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;, which serves as a sequel to the series. In the novel, Clarissa is now in her late 20s and trying to navigate life as an adult. In March 2018, it was reported that a sequel to the series was in development at Nickelodeon, with Clarissa now as a mother. In March 2022, Hart revealed the reboot was not moving forward at Nickelodeon.

==Premise==
The main characters in the show are Clarissa Darling, her family (consisting of her father Marshall, her mother Janet, and her younger brother Ferguson) and her best friend Sam, all living in a small, unnamed suburban town somewhere in Ohio. Clarissa had a pet baby alligator, Elvis, which she kept in a kiddie-sandbox and appeared sporadically in early episodes.

&quot;Clarissa&quot; was credited with becoming the first Nickelodeon series to feature a female lead, which led the network to create other shows such as &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot;, &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; and &quot;The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo&quot;. Its popularity among both boys and girls also helped to debunk a myth that a children&#x27;s series with a female lead would not appeal to boys.

Clarissa dealt with normal adolescent issues such as first crushes, getting a driver&#x27;s license and preparing for college and working. These topics were dealt with far less dramatically than they were on other similar shows at the time (such as &quot;Full House&quot; and &quot;Blossom&quot;). For instance, in one episode Clarissa accidentally shoplifts a piece of lingerie but is neither caught by store security nor punished by her parents; she spends most of the episode trying to figure out how to remedy the situation on her own. Although terms like &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;sex drive&quot; were occasionally uttered during the show&#x27;s run, most dialogue was kept family-friendly. One running gag involved her friend Sam often entering the scene by a ladder (accompanied by a characteristic chord of guitar music) through her bedroom window. A repeating theme during the series was the sibling rivalry between Clarissa and Ferguson, showing their repeated attempts to harm or even (as in the series premiere) to &quot;kill&quot; each other.

Unique to the show was Clarissa&#x27;s tendency to tackle the episode&#x27;s central theme through the creation of a fictional video game. The show also integrated some of Hart&#x27;s real-life likes, such as the band They Might Be Giants.

==Episodes==

The decision to structure the episodes into five seasons of thirteen episodes each was made after the show ended its original broadcast run. During the original run of the series, the seasons were not well defined.
==Characters==
===Main===
* Clarissa Marie Darling (Melissa Joan Hart) ‚Äì A smart, witty, sarcastic and realistic teenage girl. Despite her rationalism, she often tends to exaggerate any problem she is facing. She was around 13 years old when the series began and was a freshman at Thomas Tupper Junior High School. Her interests include computer game programming, photography, journalism and rock music. Though she is usually mild-mannered, she can be just as selfish and calculating as her younger brother Ferguson. Clarissa is best known for her unique fashion sense, typically involving very colorful, mismatched clothing. During Season 1, Clarissa had an alligator named Elvis, but in the first episode of Season 2, Clarissa explained that her parents sent Elvis back to Florida when he grew too big. In Mitchell Kriegman&#x27;s novel, &quot;Things I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;, Clarissa further elaborated that he &quot;disappeared under mysterious circumstances&quot; and &quot;it took years to get mom to confess that she gave away the reptilian Elvis without telling me after Ferguson tried to shove a pocket watch down its throat thinking it would win him the role of Captain Hook in the school play.&quot; In reality David Ellis, who worked as art director in-house on the series, suggested that the show may have been under pressure from the ASPCA to remove the alligator from later episodes and that it would also represent the idea that Clarissa was also growing older.
* Marshall Darling (Joe O&#x27;Connor) ‚Äì Clarissa and Ferguson&#x27;s father. He is an architect who designs unusually shaped buildings, mostly retail and tourist attractions (such as the &quot;Fryfel Tower&quot;). Clarissa sometimes comes to him for advice, but he is less reliable in this role than Janet. He often calls Clarissa &quot;sport&quot;, seldom addressing her by name. He and Janet are former flower children from the 1960s. In comparison to adult co-star Elizabeth Hess, O&#x27;Connor initially had difficulty becoming part of the ensemble and accepting the show was primarily centered around Clarissa and that the rest of the family were more supporting characters. As Kriegman later explained &quot;after a while you kinda have to take a backseat and understand that it&#x27;s CLARISSA Explains It All, not The Darling Family.&quot; In the unaired Pilot, he was played by Terry Layman.
* Janet Darling (Elizabeth Hess) ‚Äì Clarissa and Ferguson&#x27;s mother. She is the only family member Clarissa sees as a voice of reason and thus she seeks advice from her occasionally. She is a teacher who works at a children&#x27;s museum. She is also an environmentalist and an organic food enthusiast who often cooks bizarre meals using lima beans or tofu. Despite an extensive background in theatre and performing arts, Hess later recalled that Kriegman advised her that she didn&#x27;t need to use her &quot;very big range as an actress&quot; and that he cast her because he thought she was a &quot;sexy mom&quot;. Despite this, Kriegman commented years later that Hess &quot;was always fun&quot; on the set. In the unaired Pilot, she was played by Nancy Youngblut, who also played as Mrs. Cheesebrow the Guidance Counselor in a Season 2 episode.
* Ferguson W. Darling (Jason Zimbler) ‚Äì Clarissa&#x27;s younger brother, a mischievous youngster. He and Clarissa continually antagonize each other. She refers to him with several epithets such as &quot;Ferg-face&quot;, &quot;Fergwad&quot;, &quot;Ferghead&quot;, &quot;Ferglips&quot;, &quot;Fergbrains&quot;, &quot;Fergbreath.&quot; He loves money and comes up with get-rich-quick schemes. He is also a Young Republican who idolizes Dan Quayle and Ronald Reagan. He attends school with her and is approximately one or two years younger. In some episodes Clarissa and Ferguson occasionally collaborate, usually to the advantage of both. However, he is somewhat less popular at school than Clarissa. Ferguson&#x27;s mom gave him her maiden name for a first name. Despite achieving fame relatively early in his career, unlike co-star Hart, Zimbler decided to not pursue an acting career and attended college instead. As Zimbler later recalled, &quot;somewhere on the show, I think I grew up.&quot;
* Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; Anders (Sean O&#x27;Neal) ‚Äì Clarissa&#x27;s best friend and confidant. Generally more optimistic and upbeat than she is, he often asks &quot;What&#x27;s the worst that can happen?&quot; He is perhaps best known for entering her second-story bedroom with a ladder after a distinctive guitar chord plays followed by Clarissa&#x27;s &quot;Hi, Sam&quot; greeting. Creator Mitchell Kriegman explained that Sam entering the house through Clarissa&#x27;s bedroom window was &quot;a way to get him into her room [...] and start interacting faster&quot; as well as keeping their relationship non-sexual. He is smart and polite and enjoys skateboarding. His parents are divorced (mentioned in the pilot) and it is mentioned early on that his mother left his father to join a Roller derby. Sam&#x27;s father works as a sports journalist and later gives Clarissa the opportunity to complete some work experience with him. In the unaired Pilot, he was played by Darren E. Higgins.

She later misses his affections in Season 2, and they begin a relationship which ends in Season 4. He appeared in a total of five episodes, the most of any recurring character.

==Production==

Show creator Mitchell Kriegman, who had a background as a short-story writer and video artist, had previously worked on shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. He sought to create an offbeat, trendsetting character living a typical teenager&#x27;s life, but who did not fit the stereotypical representations of teenage girls on television at the time. Kriegman said, &quot;I thought that if other people ... knew what was going on in a 13-year-old girl&#x27;s mind, it would be cool. They are really experimenting at that age.&quot;

&quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; was the second sitcom to premiere on Nickelodeon in 1991, after &quot;Hey Dude&quot; ended its run. It was one of seven new programs (three animated and four live-action) to premiere on Nickelodeon that year, as the network began producing more original programming. It outlived the other live-action series introduced that year, &quot;Welcome Freshmen&quot;, &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot;, and &quot;Fifteen&quot;, although &quot;Fifteen&quot; (an imported Canadian series) also lasted 65 episodes. Production on the pilot episode took place in September 1990, with Season 1 production beginning in February 1991 and series production wrapping in December 1993.

The show&#x27;s theme song was sung by Rachel Sweet. It consisted entirely of a melody sung on the syllable &quot;Na,&quot; punctuated with the occasional &quot;Way cool!&quot; or &quot;All right! All right!&quot; and underscored by rhythmic instrumentation, ending with a resounding &quot;Just do it!&quot;

A pilot for a follow-up series, &quot;Clarissa&quot;, was shot for CBS in 1995, but was not picked up by the network. The pilot was shown on two occasions on Nickelodeon after the original series had ended production. The new series would have involved Clarissa&#x27;s internship at a New York City newspaper. Comedian Robert Klein costarred in the pilot as the newspaper&#x27;s editor. Supporting roles were played by Marian Seldes and Lisa Gay Hamilton. In 2002, Hart said that she would not be interested in a cast reunion project: &quot;No. Shirley Temple taught me one thing. And that was once you finish a career, you move on.&quot; In her next television series, &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;, her character actually did become a journalist.

==Broadcast==
After debuting on Saturday, March 23, 1991, at 6 p.m, and repeating twice the next day, &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; moved to Sundays at 12:30¬†p.m. and 6:30¬†p.m. starting on April 7, 1991. The following year the show moved to anchor the SNICK block of Saturday-night Nickelodeon programming, airing at 8 p.m. Saturdays starting on August 15, 1992. New airings continued to be shown at that time (with repeat airings at noon on Sundays) until the end of the series run.

===Reruns===
The series aired in reruns on Nickelodeon from 1994 to 1999, a second time in 2001 as part of the TEENick block, and a third time in 2004 as part of &quot;U-Pick Live&quot; Old School Pick. It also aired on The N from 2002 to 2003.

The series returned in reruns to &quot;TeenNick&quot; on July 25, 2011, as part of its The &#x27;90s Are All That block. It aired at 10 p.m. Pacific / 1 a.m. Eastern, with the first episode having been &#x27;The Understudy&#x27; from Season 2.
TeenNick replaced the show with &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; on September 5, 2011. The series returned to The &#x27;90s Are All That from September 26, 2011, to October 6, 2011, when the show was replaced with &quot;Hey Dude&quot;. It then returned to TeenNick on December 31, 2011, with the airing of the series finale at a special timeslot, 11:00¬†p.m., to celebrate the end of 2011, and aired on the block again at 1:00am on January 1, 2012, with the airing of the series premiere to celebrate the beginning of 2012. The show aired on The &#x27;90s Are All That in a marathon on the night of December 30, 2012, and then a marathon every night from January 21, 2013, to January 27, 2013. On October 6, 2015, the show returned to the block, now known as The Splat. In 2019, the show is being rerun during the overnight hours on the Nick Pluto TV channel. On March 23, 2020, the show began airing reruns on the NickRewind block.

==Home video releases==
From 1994 to 95, a number of VHS tapes were released through Sony Wonder each containing 2 or 3 episodes alongside other Nickelodeon shows, usually centered around a certain theme such as school, dating, or sibling rivalry. The final VHS release released on March 21, 1995 was the final time that Hart and Zimbler portrayed their respective characters, Clarissa and Ferguson, on screen together.

In May 2005, the show&#x27;s first season was released on DVD as part of the &quot;Nickelodeon Rewind Collection&quot; by Viacom&#x27;s corporate subsidiary, Paramount Pictures. The second season was scheduled to be released a few months later, but it was pulled from Paramount Pictures&#x27; release schedule. To this date, there are no plans to release the series further on DVD.

Season one is also available on iTunes, Xbox Live, and the PlayStation Store.
Many of the various episodes from the 5 seasons of the series are also available on Paramount+.

==Awards==
In 1994, the series was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program. In addition, Hart, O&#x27;Neal, and Zimbler also received multiple Young Artist Award nominations. Hart won three competitive Young Artist Awards during the show&#x27;s original run, as well as receiving the association&#x27;s honorary Former Child Star Award in 2013 for her role as Clarissa.

== Revival ==
In March 2018, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said a revival of the show was &quot;in early development&quot; at Nickelodeon. Hart was reportedly to reprise her role as the title character, who would now be a mother. Hart was also to serve as executive producer on the series alongside original series creator Kriegman, who was in talks to return as a writer. The reports were not confirmed by any of the participants.

In March 2022, Hart revealed that the reboot was not moving forward at Nickelodeon.

<doc id="314455" wikidata="Q432585" url="?curid=314455" title="Jean-Baptiste Dubos">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Dubos (; 14 December 1670 ‚Äì 23 March 1742), also referred to as l&#x27;[[Abb√©]] Du Bos, was a French author. He was also a diplomat and an art critic.

==Life==
Dubos was born in Beauvais. He was educated in Paris and received a Master of Arts in 1688 and a Bachelor of Theology in 1692. After studying theology, he gave it up in favour of public law and politics. He was employed by M. de Torcy, minister of foreign affairs, and by the regent and Cardinal Dubois in several secret missions. He was rewarded with a pension and other advantages. Having obtained these, he retired from political life and devoted himself to history and literature. During his travels as French envoy, he cultivated connections with contemporary prominent thinkers. These included Pierre Bayle, Jean Chardin, and John Locke, who he became close friends with.

Dubos gained such distinction as an author that in 1720 he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, and, in 1723, was appointed to the position of perpetual secretary in succession to Andr√© Dacier. He died in Paris, repeating the remark, &quot;Death is a law, not a punishment.&quot;

==Works==

Dubos&#x27; first work was &quot;L&#x27;Histoire des quatre Gordiens prouv√©e et illustr√©e par des m√©dailles&quot; (Paris, 1695), which, in spite of its ingenuity, did not succeed in convincing most people. At the beginning of the war of 1701 he was charged with different negotiations (both in the Netherlands and England). In an attempt to persuade those countries to adopt a policy of peace, he published a work entitled &quot;Les Int√©r√©ts de l&#x27;Angleterre mal entendus dans la guerre pr√©sente&quot; (Amsterdam, 1703). This work contained indiscreet disclosures and predictions that were not fulfilled. The enemy took advantage of the work, and a wag took occasion to remark that the title ought to be read thus: &quot;Les Int√©r√™ts de l&#x27;Angleterre mal entendus par l&#x27;abb√© Dubos&quot;. It is remarkable as containing a distinct prophecy of the revolt of the American colonies from Great Britain.

Dubos&#x27; next work was &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de la Ligue de Cambray&quot; (Paris, 1709, 1728 and 1785, 2 vols.), a full, clear and interesting history, commended by Voltaire. In 1734 he published his &quot;Histoire critique de l&#x27;√©tablissement de la monarchie fran√ßaise dans les Gaules&quot; (3 vols. 4to)--a work the object of which was to prove that the Franks had entered Gaul, not as conquerors, but at the request of the nation, which, according to him, had called them in to govern it. This system, though unfolded with a degree of skill and ability that, at first, procured many zealous partisans, was attacked by Montesquieu at the end of the thirtieth book of the &quot;Esprit des lois&quot;.

Dubos&#x27; principle work, &quot;R√©flexions critiques sur la po√©sie et sur la peinture&quot;, was published for the first time in 1719 (2 vols, but often reprinted in three volumes). In France it was considered an important text for the study of aesthetics and was a popular textbook until the 19th century. Like his history of the League of Cambray, it was highly praised by Voltaire. The work was rendered more remarkable by the fact that its author had no practical acquaintance with any one of the arts whose principles he discussed. This work has been noted for elevating criticism to a place among the arts. Besides the works above enumerated, a manifesto of Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria, against the emperor Leopold (relative to the succession in Spain) has been attributed to Dubos from the excellence of the style.

==Excerpts==

&quot;[O]ne of the greatest wants of man is to have his mind incessantly occupied. The heaviness which quickly attends the inactivity of the mind, is a situation so very disagreeable to man, that he frequently chooses to expose himself to the most painful excesses, rather than be troubled with it.&quot; &quot;Critical Reflections&quot;, I.

<doc id="314456" wikidata="Q841074" url="?curid=314456" title="Elgin, Moray">
<text>Elgin ( ; ; ) is a historic town (former cathedral city) and formerly a royal burgh in Moray, Scotland. It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the River Lossie on the higher ground above the floodplain where the town of Birnie is. There, the church of Birnie Kirk was built in 1140 and still serves the community.

Elgin is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in 1190 AD. It was created a royal burgh in the 12th century by King David I of Scotland, and by that time had a castle on top of the present-day Lady Hill to the west of the town. The origin of the name Elgin is likely to be Celtic. It may derive from &#x27;Aille&#x27; literally signifying beauty, but in topography a beautiful place or valley. Another possibility is &#x27;ealg&#x27;, meaning both &#x27;Ireland&#x27; and &#x27;worthy&#x27;. The termination &#x27;gin&#x27; or &#x27;in&#x27; are Celtic endings signifying little or diminutive forms, hence Elgin could mean beautiful place, worthy place or little Ireland.

==History==

The discovery of the Elgin Pillar, a 9th-century class II Pictish stone, under the High Street in 1823 suggests there may have been an Early Christian presence in the area of the later market, but there is no further evidence of activity before Elgin was created a Royal Burgh in the 12th century. In August 1040, MacBeth&#x27;s army defeated and killed Duncan I at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near Elgin. Elgin is first recorded in a charter of David I in 1151 in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of Urquhart. David had made Elgin a royal burgh around 1130, after his defeat of √ìengus of Moray. During David&#x27;s reign, the castle was established at the top of what is now Lady Hill. The town received a royal charter from Alexander II in 1224 when he granted the land for a new cathedral to Andrew, Bishop of Moray. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at Kinneddar, Birnie and Spynie. The ancient Forest of Darnaway was designated a Royal Forest and was used by the Scottish kings for hunting.

Alexander II was Elgin&#x27;s greatest benefactor and returned many times to his royal castle. He established the two religious houses of the town, the Dominicans or Blackfriars on the west side and the Franciscans or Greyfriars in the east. Further to the east stood the Hospital of Maison Dieu, or House of God also founded during the reign of Alexander II for the reception of poor men and women.

On 19 July 1224, the foundation stone of the new Elgin Cathedral was ceremoniously laid. The cathedral was completed sometime after 1242 but was completely destroyed by fire in 1270. The reasons for this are unrecorded. The buildings now remain as ruins date from the reconstruction following that fire. The Chartulary of Moray described the completed cathedral as &quot;Mirror of the country and the glory of the kingdom&quot;.

Edward I of England travelled twice to Elgin. During his first visit in 1296, he was impressed by what he saw. Preserved in the Cotton library now held in the British Library is the journal of his stay, describing the castle and the town of Elgin as &quot;bon chastell et bonne ville&quot;‚Äîgood castle and good town. By his second visit in September 1303, the castle&#x27;s wooden interior had been burned while held by the English governor, Henry de Rye. As a result, he only stayed in Elgin for two days and then camped at Kinloss Abbey from 13 September until 4 October. King Edward was furious when David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray, joined Scotland&#x27;s cause with Bruce, and Edward appealed to the Pope who excommunicated the bishop, thus removing papal protection, causing him to flee to Orkney, then to Norway, only to return after Robert Bruce&#x27;s victories against the English. After Edward&#x27;s death in July 1307, Robert the Bruce attacked Elgin and then retook Scotland in 1308.

In August 1370 Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray began payments to Alexander Stewart, Wolf of Badenoch, King Robert III&#x27;s brother, for the protection of his lands and men. In February 1390, the bishop then turned to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection. This action infuriated Stewart and in May he descended from his castle on an island in Lochindorb and burned the town of Forres in revenge. In June he burned much of Elgin, including two monasteries, St Giles Church, the Hospital of Maison Dieu and the cathedral. Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot; (a 15th-century history of Scotland) described this action by &quot;wyld, wykked Heland-men&quot;. The rebuilding of the cathedral took many years; but much of it has since crumbled away due to the inferior quality of the stone made available to the 15th- and 16th-century masons, while the 13th-century construction still remains. In 1506, the great central tower collapsed and although rebuilding work began the next year it was not completed till 1538.

===From the Reformation to the eighteenth century===

The citizens of Elgin and surrounding areas did not seem to object to the new religion following the Reformation. In 1568 the lead was stripped from the roof of the cathedral, by order of the Privy Council of Scotland. The lead was sold to William Birnie and Alexander Clark. The proceeds went to the maintenance of Regent Moray&#x27;s soldiers, but the ship taking the lead cargo to Holland sank almost immediately on leaving Aberdeen harbour. Without this protection, the building began to deteriorate. 

The Kirk Session records of Elgin name women who danced at New Year 1623 to the sound of a trumpet. Six men, described as guisers or &quot;gwysseris&quot; performed a sword dance wearing masks and visors covering their faces in the churchyard and in the courtyard of a house. They were fined 40 shillings each. The fabric of the Cathedral continued to deteriorate. In 1637, the rafters over the choir were blown down and in 1640 the minister of St Giles along with the Laird of Innes and Alexander Brodie of Brodie, all ardent Covenanters, removed and destroyed the ornately carved screen and woodwork that had remained intact. The tracery of the West window was destroyed sometime between 1650 and 1660 by Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers. On Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower collapsed for the second time in its history but caused much more damage. The rubble was quarried for various projects in the vicinity until 1807 when, through the efforts of Joseph King of Newmill, a wall was built around the cathedral and a keeper&#x27;s house erected. Mountains of this rubble were cleared by one John Shanks, enabling visitors to view the ornate stonemasonry. Shanks was presented with an ornate snuffbox by the authorities; it is now in Elgin Museum.

When Daniel Defoe toured Scotland in 1717, he visited Elgin and said:In this rich country is the city, or town rather, of Elgin; I say city, because in antient time the monks claim&#x27;d it for a city; and the cathedral shews, by its ruins, that it was a place of great magnificence. Nor must it be wonder&#x27;d at, if in so pleasant, so rich, and so agreeable a part of the country, all the rest being so differing from it, the clergy should seat themselves in a proportion&#x27;d number, seeing we must do them the justice to say, that if there is any place richer and more fruitful, and pleasant than another, they seldom fail to find it out. As the country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the town of Elgin in particular; for the gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the court, for this part of the island, leave their Highland habitations in the winter and come and live here for the diversion of the place and plenty of provisions; and there is, on this account, a great variety of gentlemen for society, and that of all parties and of all opinions. This makes Elgin a very agreeable place to live in, notwithstanding its distance, being above 450 measur&#x27;d miles [725¬†km] from London, and more, if we must go by Edinburgh.

The cathedral is known as the &quot;Lantern of the North.&quot; When Bishop Bur wrote to King Robert III, complaining of the wanton destruction done to the building by the King&#x27;s brother, the Wolf of Badenoch, he describes the cathedral as &quot;the ornament of this district, the glory of the kingdom and the admiration of foreigners.&quot; Chambers, in his &quot;Picture of Scotland&quot;, says: It is an allowed fact, which the ruins seem still to attest, that this was by far the most splendid specimen of ecclesiastical architecture in Scotland, the abbey church of Melrose not excepted. It must be acknowledged that the edifice last mentioned is a wonderful instance of symmetry and elaborate decoration; yet in extent, in loftiness, in impressive magnificence, and even in minute decoration, Elgin has been manifestly superior. Enough still remains to impress the solitary traveller with a sense of admiration mixed with astonishment.

Lachlan Shaw in his &quot;History of the Province of Moray&quot; was equally impressed when he wrotethe church when entire was a building of Gothic architecture inferior to few in Europe.

Prince Charles Edward Stuart travelled to Elgin from Inverness in March 1746 and, falling ill with a feverish cold, stayed for 11 days before returning to await the arrival of the king&#x27;s army. He stayed in Elgin with Mrs Anderson, a passionate Jacobite, at Thunderton House. She kept the sheets that the Prince slept on and was buried in them a quarter of a century later. The Duke of Cumberland passed through the town on 13 April, camping at Alves on the way to meet the Prince in battle on Drummossie Muir. After the battle, William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock, one of the Prince&#x27;s generals, was captured and taken to London and eventual execution, but he wrote to his friend from prison about his indebtedness to the shoemakers of Elgin: Beside my personal debts mentioned in general and particular in the State, there is one for which I am liable in justice, if it is not paid, owing to poor people who gave their work for it by my orders. It was at Elgin in Murray, the Regiment I commanded wanted shoes. I commissioned something about seventy pair of shoes and brogues, which might come to 3 shillngs or three shillings and sixpence each, one with the other. The magistrates divided them among the shoemakers of the town and country, and each shoemaker furnished his proportion. I drew on the town, for the price, out of the composition laid on them, but I was afterwards told at Inverness that, it was believed, the composition was otherwise applied, and the poor shoemakers not paid. As these poor people wrought by my orders, it will be a great ease to my heart to think they are not to lose by me, as too many have done in the course of that year, but had I lived I might have made some inquiry after but now it is impossible, as their hardships in loss of horses and such things, which happeened through my soldiers, are so interwoven with what was done by other people, that it would be very hard, if not impossible, to separate them. If you&#x27;ll write to Mr Innes of Dalkinty at Elgin (with whom I was quartered when I lay there), he will send you an account of the shoes, and if they were paid to the shoemakers or no; and if they are not, I beg you&#x27;ll get my wife, or my successors to pay them when they can...

===Nineteenth century===

In the 19th century, the old medieval town of Elgin was swept away. The first major addition to the town centre was the Assembly Rooms, built in 1821 by the Trinity Lodge of Freemasons, at the corner of High Street and North Street. In 1819, Dr Gray&#x27;s Hospital was built on unused ground. The building has imposing columns and distinctive dome. Dr Alexander Gray, a doctor who worked for and made his fortune with the East India Company, endowed ¬£26,000 for the hospital. In 1828 the new parish church of St Giles was built at a cost of ¬£10,000. L. General Andrew Anderson, born in Elgin, also of the East India Company, died in 1824 and bequeathed ¬£70,000 to the town to found an institution for the welfare of the elderly poor and for the education of orphans. The Anderson Institution was built in the east end of the town in 1832 with accommodation for 50 children and ten elderly people. The Burgh Court House was built in 1841, the museum was completed in 1842 and Elgin Sheriff Court was built in 1866.

The Morayshire Railway was officially opened in ceremonies at Elgin and Lossiemouth on 10 August 1852, the steam engines having been delivered to Lossiemouth by sea. It was the first railway north of Aberdeen and initially ran only between Elgin and Lossiemouth. It was later extended south to Craigellachie. The Great North of Scotland Railway took over the working of the line in 1863 and bought the company in 1881 following the Morayshire Railway&#x27;s return to solvency from crippling debt.

The town was becoming prosperous, and by 1882 it had a Head Post Office with a savings bank, insurance and telegraph departments, and branches of the Bank of Scotland and the British Linen Company, Caledonian, Commercial, North of Scotland, Royal and Union Banks, and the National Securities Savings Bank, offices or agencies of 48 insurance companies, five hotels, and a newspaper.

The Cooper Park drill hall was completed in 1908.

The war memorial in Elgin dates from 1921 and represents &quot;Peace and Victory&quot;. It was designed by Percy Portsmouth.

==Geography and geology==
The modern town straddles the River Lossie, with the suburbs of Bishopmill to the north and New Elgin to the south. Permo‚ÄìTriassic rocks, rare in Scotland, are commonly found around Elgin. These are composed of aeolian sandstone formed when this area was subjected to desert conditions. Quarry Wood, on the town&#x27;s edge, has a formation nicknamed Cuttie&#x27;s Hillock which produced the internationally known fossils called the Elgin Reptiles. In the Elgin district, boulders belonging to the lowest group of Jurassic strata, Oxford clay and chalk are found both in glacial deposits and on the surface of the ground. The largest of these deposits is at Linksfield, where limestone and shale lie on boulder clay. There is a large hill in Elgin&#x27;s town centre, often viewed as the highlight of the Elgin tourist trail.

==Climate==
Elgin&#x27;s climate is temperate maritime, with cool summers and relatively mild winters due to its proximity to the sea. Rainfall is quite low as it is in the rain shadow of mountains to the west and south-west.


==Demography==



==Economy==
The Elgin‚ÄìForres‚ÄìLossiemouth triangle is heavily dependent on Royal Air Force stations for the employment of civilians. In 2005, RAF Lossiemouth along with its neighbour RAF Kinloss contributed ¬£156.5 million (including civilian expenditure) to the Moray economy, of which ¬£76.6 million was retained and spent locally. The bases provide, directly or indirectly, 21% of all employment in the area, although in 2010 the closure of RAF Kinloss had a significant effect on these numbers. Aware of the impact that the Air Force has on the area&#x27;s economy, the local population instigated a long campaign to save RAF Lossiemouth, the future of which was also in doubt. How much of an influence this had upon the government&#x27;s and Ministry of Defence&#x27;s final decision is uncertain, but the base was ultimately saved and RAF Leuchars instead faced the axe as part of the same Strategic Defence and Security Review. RAF Leuchars will now become, like RAF Kinloss, an army base. Other areas offering significant employment are local authority, construction and real estate, food and drink, tourism, transport, business services and wholesale/retail.

Whisky is an important component of the wider local economy, with Glen Moray distillery, Miltonduff distillery and the BenRiach distillery all within six miles of Elgin.

In a 2006 study, Elgin was shown to be one of the most expensive towns in which to buy property in Scotland.

==Politics==

===National governments===
Elgin is in the Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey constituency of the United Kingdom Parliament which returns a Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons, currently Graham Leadbitter of the SNP. 
Elgin is in the Moray constituency of the Scottish Parliament which has significantly different boundaries to the UK Parliament constituency. The constituency returns a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to Holyrood‚Äîcurrently Richard Lochhead of the SNP‚Äîand is part of the Highlands and Islands electoral region.

===Local government===

Elgin is represented on the Moray Council by two wards: Elgin City North and Elgin City South. Each ward elects three members using the single transferable vote system - a form of proportional representation.

=== City status ===
Elgin unsuccessfully bid to become a city as part of Elizabeth II&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022. The last Scottish town to become a city was Dunfermline in 2022.

==Transport==
Elgin is situated on the A96 trunk route which connects the cities of Aberdeen and Inverness. Heavy traffic through the town causes serious congestion. Scottish transport minister Tavish Scott visited the town in August 2006 to look at the traffic management problems and to meet campaigners for a bypass. It is estimated that a bypass would remove about one-third of traffic from Elgin&#x27;s streets. The A941 runs from Lossiemouth through Elgin to Rothes, Craigellachie, Dufftown and Rhynie.

Elgin railway station is operated by ScotRail. The railway also connects to Aberdeen and Inverness which have trains to other UK destinations.

Elgin&#x27;s bus station is located adjacent to the St Giles Centre and is operated mainly by Stagecoach. It provides services within Elgin and to other local towns as well as to Aberdeen and Inverness.

The nearest airports are Inverness Airport, which has flights to mainly UK destinations, and Aberdeen Airport which has UK and international flights.

<text>Tabes dorsalis is a late consequence of neurosyphilis, characterized by the slow degeneration (specifically, demyelination) of the neural tracts primarily in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord (nerve root). These patients have lancinating nerve root pain which is aggravated by coughing, and features of sensory ataxia with ocular involvement.

Signs and symptoms may not appear for decades after the initial infection and include weakness, diminished reflexes, paresthesias (shooting and burning pains, pricking sensations, and formication), hypoesthesias (abnormally diminished sense of touch), tabetic gait (locomotor ataxia), progressive degeneration of the joints, loss of coordination, episodes of intense pain and disturbed sensation (including glossodynia), personality changes, urinary incontinence, dementia, deafness, visual impairment, positive Romberg&#x27;s test, and impaired response to light (Argyll Robertson pupil). The skeletal musculature is hypotonic due to destruction of the sensory limb of the spindle reflex. The deep tendon reflexes are also diminished or absent; for example, the &quot;knee jerk&quot; or patellar reflex may be lacking (Westphal&#x27;s sign). A complication of tabes dorsalis can be transient neuralgic paroxysmal pain affecting the eyes and the ophthalmic areas, previously called &quot;Pel&#x27;s crises&quot; after Dutch physician P.K. Pel. Now more commonly called &quot;tabetic ocular crises&quot;, an attack is characterized by sudden, intense eye pain, tearing of the eyes and sensitivity to light.

&quot;Tabes dorsalgia&quot; is a related lancinating back pain.

&quot;Tabetic gait&quot; is a characteristic ataxic gait of untreated syphilis where the person&#x27;s feet slap the ground as they strike the floor due to loss of proprioception. In daylight the person can avoid some unsteadiness by watching their own feet.

==Cause==
Tabes dorsalis is caused by demyelination by advanced syphilis infection (tertiary syphilis) when the primary infection by the causative spirochete bacterium, &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;, is left untreated for an extended period of time (past the point of blood infection by the organism). The spirochete invades large myelinated fibers, leading to the involvement of the dorsal column medial leminiscus pathway rather than the spinothalamic tract.

==Diagnosis==
Routine screening for syphilis.
Treponemal antibody usually positive both in blood and in CSF also.
In CSF lymphocytosis and elevated protein found.
Serological tests are usually positive.

== Treatment ==
Intravenously administered penicillin is the treatment of choice. Associated pain can be treated with opiates, valproate, or carbamazepine. Those with tabes dorsalis may also require physical therapy and occupational therapy to deal with muscle wasting and weakness. Preventive treatment for those who come into sexual contact with an individual with syphilis is important.

== Prognosis ==
Left untreated, tabes dorsalis can lead to paralysis, dementia, and blindness. Existing nerve damage cannot be reversed.

==Epidemiology==
The disease is more frequent in males than in females. Onset is commonly during mid-life. The incidence of tabes dorsalis is rising, in part due to co-associated HIV infection.

==History==
Although there were earlier clinical accounts of this disease, and descriptions and illustrations of the posterior columns of the spinal cord, it was the Berlin neurologist Romberg whose account became the classical textbook description, first published in German and later translated into English.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, completed his doctorate on tabes dorsalis in 1885.

==Society and culture==
===Notable patients===
* German storywriter E.T.A. Hoffmann appears to have had and died in 1822 from tabes dorsalis.
* Mary Todd Lincoln [Dec 12, 1818 - Jul 16, 1882], wife of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and America&#x27;s First Lady from 1861 to 1865 most probably suffered from tabes dorsalis as early as 1869, at age 51. She died of a stroke at age 63 in Springfield, IL.
* The French novelist Alphonse Daudet kept a journal of the pain he experienced from this condition which was posthumously published as &quot;La Doulou&quot; (1930) and translated into English as &quot;In the Land of Pain&quot; (2002) by Julian Barnes.
* Poet Charles Baudelaire contracted syphilis in 1839 and resorted to opium to help alleviate the pain of tabes dorsalis ascending his spine.
* Painter √âdouard Manet died of syphilis complications, including tabes dorsalis, in 1883, aged 51.
* Boxer Charley Mitchell
* Meyer Nudelman, the father of author and doctor Sherwin Nuland, who described his father&#x27;s condition extensively in his book &quot;Lost in America; A Journey with my Father&quot; (2003).

<text>George Cruikshank or Cruickshank ( ; 27 September 1792 ‚Äì 1 February 1878) was a British caricaturist and book illustrator, praised as the &quot;modern Hogarth&quot; during his life. His book illustrations for his friend Charles Dickens, and many other authors, reached an international audience.

==Early life==
Cruikshank was born in London. His father, Edinburgh-born Isaac Cruikshank, was one of the leading caricaturists of the late 1790s and Cruikshank started his career as his father&#x27;s apprentice and assistant. His older brother, Isaac Robert, also followed in the family business as a caricaturist and illustrator.

Cruikshank&#x27;s early work was caricature; but in 1823, at the age of 31, he started to focus on book illustration. He illustrated the first, 1823 English translation (by Edgar Taylor and David Jardine) of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;, published in two volumes as &quot;German Popular Stories&quot;.

On 16 October 1827, he married Mary Ann Walker (1807‚Äì1849). Two years after her death, on 7 March 1851, he married Eliza Widdison. The two lived at 263 Hampstead Road, north London.

Cruikshank had fathered 11 illegitimate children with a mistress named Adelaide Attree, his former servant, who lived close to where he lived with his wife. Adelaide was ostensibly married and had taken the married surname &#x27;Archibold&#x27;.

==Sociopolitical caricatures and illustrations==

Cruikshank&#x27;s early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He achieved early success collaborating with William Hone in his political satire &quot;The Political House That Jack Built&quot; (1819). In the same year he produced the now-infamous anti-abolitionist piece &quot;The New Union Club&quot;. It satirised a dinner party organised by abolitionists with black guests. While this piece was praised as &quot;the finest of G.C.&#x27;s caricatures&quot; during the 19th century, it is now viewed as one of the most racist prints of its era. His 1819 print, &quot;The Belle Alliance, or the Female Reformers of Blackburn!!!,&quot; criticised the role of women in the reform movement, portraying them as unfeminine and grotesque.His first major work was &quot;Pierce Egan&#x27;s Life in London&quot; (1821) in which the characters Tom and Jerry, two &#x27;men about town&#x27; visit various London locations and taverns to enjoy themselves and carouse. This was followed by &quot;The Comic Almanack&quot; (1835‚Äì1853) and &quot;Omnibus&quot; (1842). Cruikshank gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians. In 1820 he received a royal bribe of ¬£100 for a pledge &quot;not to caricature His Majesty&quot; (George IV of the United Kingdom) &quot;in any immoral situation&quot;. His work included a personification of England named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as James Gillray, and Thomas Rowlandson.
Cruikshank replaced one of his major influences, James Gillray, as England&#x27;s most popular satirist. For a generation he delineated Tories, Whigs and Radicals impartially. Satirical material came to him from every public event¬†‚Äì wars abroad, the enemies of Britain (he was highly patriotic), the frolic, among other qualities, such as the weird and terrible, in which he excelled. His hostility to enemies of Britain and a crude racism is evident in his illustrations commissioned to accompany William Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;History of the Irish rebellion in 1798&quot; (1845) where his lurid depictions of incidents in the rebellion were characterised by the simian-like portrayal of Irish rebels. Among the other racially engaged works of Cruikshank there were caricatures about the &quot;legal barbarities&quot; of the Chinese, the subject given by his friend, Dr. W. Gourley, a participant in the ideological battle around the Arrow War, 1856‚Äì60. 
==Charles Dickens==

For Charles Dickens, Cruikshank illustrated &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; (1836), &quot;The Mudfog Papers&quot; (1837‚Äì38) and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838). He also illustrated &quot;Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi&quot; (1838), which Dickens edited under his regular , &quot;Boz&quot;. Cruikshank even acted in Dickens&#x27;s amateur theatrical company.

On 30 December 1871, Cruikshank published a letter in &quot;The Times&quot; which claimed credit for much of the plot of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. The letter launched a fierce controversy around who created the work. Cruikshank was not the first Dickens illustrator to make such a claim. Robert Seymour who illustrated the &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; suggested that the idea for that novel was originally his; however, in his preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens strenuously denied any specific input.

The friendship between Cruikshank and Dickens soured further when Cruikshank became a fanatical teetotaler in opposition to Dickens&#x27;s views of moderation.

In Somerset Maugham&#x27;s short story &quot;Miss King&quot;, Cruickshank&#x27;s influence is referenced:

==Temperance and the Volunteers==
In the late 1840s, Cruikshank&#x27;s focus shifted from book illustration to an emphasis on alcohol temperance and anti-smoking. Formerly a heavy drinker, he now supported, lectured to, and supplied illustrations for the National Temperance Society and the Total Abstinence Society, among others. The best known of these are &quot;The Bottle&quot;, 8 plates (1847), with its sequel, &quot;The Drunkard&#x27;s Children&quot;, 8 plates (1848), with the ambitious work, &quot;The Worship of Bacchus&quot;, published by subscription after the artist&#x27;s oil painting, now in the Tate Gallery, London. For his efforts, he was made vice president of the National Temperance League in 1856.

When the invasion scare of 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Movement, Cruikshank was one of those who organised Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). At first his unit was the 24th Surrey RVC, which recruited from working men who were total abstainers and was named &#x27;Havelock&#x27;s Own&#x27; in honour of Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, a hero of the Indian Mutiny and pioneer of Temperance Clubs in the army.

However, Cruikshank received little encouragement from the Lord-Lieutenant of Surrey, and was rebuked for crossing into Kent to recruit. Disgusted, he disbanded his unit in 1862 and began anew in Middlesex, organising the 48th Middlesex RVC (Havelock&#x27;s Temperance Volunteers). The unit ran into financial difficulties and when Cruikshank was forced to retire due to age, he was replaced as commanding officer by Lt-Col Cuthbert Vickers, a wealthy shipowner. However, the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette of 3 September 1868 reported that Cruikshank had resigned as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Volunteers &quot;in consequence, it is said, of the reinstatement in the service of certain officers of his corps who some time since had a difference with their Lieutenant-Colonel and were cashiered&quot;.

The 48th Middlesex merged with the 2nd City of London RVC, also a working-men&#x27;s unit, composed mainly of printers from the Fleet Street area, and the combined unit had a long history as the City of London Rifles.

==Later years==
After he developed palsy in later life, Cruikshank&#x27;s health and work began to decline in quality. He died on 1¬†February 1878 and was originally buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. In November 1878 his remains were exhumed and reburied in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, which presumably did not know of his large illegitimate family, said in its obituary: &quot;There never was a purer, simpler, more straightforward or altogether more blameless man. His nature had something childlike in its transparency.&quot;

In his lifetime he created nearly 10,000 prints, illustrations, and plates. There are collections of his works in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque commemorates Cruikshank at 293 Hampstead Road in Camden Town.

<text>Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse is an American comedy children&#x27;s television series starring Paul Reubens as the childlike Pee-wee Herman that ran from 1986 to 1990 on Saturday mornings on CBS, and airing in reruns until July 1991. The show was developed from Reubens&#x27;s popular stage show and the TV special &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;, produced for HBO, which was similar in style but featured much more adult humor.

In 2004 and 2007, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; was ranked No. 10 and No. 12 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;‚Ä≥s Top Cult Shows Ever, respectively. It was also named to &quot;Time&quot;‚Ä≥s list of the 100 Best TV Shows in 2007.

==Development==
The Pee-wee Herman character was developed by Reubens into a live stage show titled &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot; in 1980. It features many characters that would go on to appear in &quot;Playhouse&quot;, including Captain Carl, Jambi the Genie, Miss Yvonne, Pterri the Pterodactyl, and Clocky. While enjoying continuous popularity with the show, Reubens teamed with young director Tim Burton in 1985 to make the comedy film &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. It became one of the year&#x27;s surprise hits, costing a relatively modest $7¬†million to make but taking in $40¬†million at the box office.

After seeing the success of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, the CBS network approached Reubens with an ill-received cartoon series proposal. In 1986, CBS agreed to sign Reubens to act, produce, and direct his own live-action Saturday morning children&#x27;s program, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, with a budget of per episode (comparable to that of a half-hour prime-time sitcom), and full creative control, although CBS did request a few minor changes over the years.

Reubens assembled a supporting troupe that included ex-Groundlings and cast members from &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;, including Phil Hartman, John Paragon, Lynne Marie Stewart, Laurence Fishburne, and S. Epatha Merkerson. Production began in New York City in the summer of 1986 in a converted loft on Broadway, which one of the show&#x27;s writers, George McGrath, described as a &quot;sweatshop&quot;. Reubens moved the production to Los Angeles for season two in 1987, resulting in a new set and a more relaxed work atmosphere.

The creative design of the show was concocted by a troupe of artists including Wayne White, Gary Panter, Craig Bartlett, Nick Park, Richard Goleszowski, Gregory Harrison, Ric Heitzman, and Phil Trumbo. The first day of production, right as Panter began reading the scripts to find out where everything would be situated, set workers hurriedly asked him, &quot;Where&#x27;s the plans? All the carpenters are standing here ready to build everything.&quot; Panter responded, &quot;You just have to give us 15 minutes to design this thing!&quot; When asked about the styles that went into the set design, Panter said, &quot;This was like the hippie dream¬†... It was a show made by artists¬†... We put art history all over the show. It&#x27;s really like¬†... I think Mike Kelley said, and it&#x27;s right, that it&#x27;s kind of like the Googie style ‚Äì it&#x27;s like those LA types of coffee shops and stuff but kind of psychedelic, over-the-top.&quot; Several artistic filmmaking techniques are featured on the program including chroma key, stop-motion animation, and clay animation.

&quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; was designed as an educational yet entertaining and artistic show for children. Its conception was greatly influenced by shows Reubens had watched as a child, like &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, and &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;. The show quickly acquired a dual audience of kids and adults. Reubens, always trying to make Pee-wee a positive role model, sought to make a significantly moral show that would teach children the ethics of reciprocity. Reubens believed that children liked the Playhouse because it was fast-paced, colorful, and &quot;never talked down to them&quot;, while parents liked the Playhouse because it reminded them of the past.

==Production==
At the start of season two, the show moved from its New York City warehouse studio to facilities at the Hollywood Center Studios, creating changes in personnel and a change to the set that allowed the show to take advantage of the additional space. The show changed production facilities again in 1989 during its fourth season, this time at the Culver Studios, also in Los Angeles.

==Format==
The premise of the show is that host Pee-wee Herman plays in the fantastic Playhouse in Puppetland. The house is filled with toys, gadgets, talking furniture and appliances (such as Magic Screen and Chairry), puppet characters (such as Conky the Robot and Pterri the baby Pteranodon), and Jambi (John Paragon), a disembodied genie&#x27;s head who lives in a jeweled box. The Playhouse is visited by a regular cast of human characters, including Miss Yvonne (Lynne Marie Stewart), Reba the Mail Lady (S. Epatha Merkerson), Captain Carl (Phil Hartman), Cowboy Curtis (Laurence Fishburne), and a small group of children called The Playhouse Gang.

Although primarily a live-action comedy, each episode includes segments featuring puppetry, video animation, and prepared sequences using Chroma key and stock footage (for example when Pee-wee jumps into the Magic Screen), as well as inserted clay animation sequences (some made by Aardman Animations, who would later make &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot;) and excerpts from cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation and in the public domain, usually presented by the character &quot;The King of Cartoons&quot;. Each episode features specially written soundtrack music by rock and pop musicians such as Mark Mothersbaugh (Devo), Todd Rundgren, Mitchell Froom, and The Residents. The show&#x27;s theme song performance is credited to &quot;Ellen Shaw&quot;, though in her autobiography, Cyndi Lauper admits to being the actual singer.

The show has many recurring gags, themes, and devices. Each episode usually contained a running gag particular to that episode, or a specific event or dilemma that sends Pee-wee into an emotional frenzy. At the beginning of each episode, viewers are told the day&#x27;s &quot;secret word&quot; (often issued by Conky the Robot) and are instructed to &quot;scream real loud&quot; every time a character says the word.

CBS and Reubens mutually agreed to end the show at the end of the 1990‚Äì91 season after five seasons and 45 episodes. The last original episode aired on November 17, 1990. In July 1991, Reubens was arrested for exposing himself in a Sarasota, Florida, adult movie theater, prompting CBS to immediately stop airing its &quot;Playhouse&quot; re-runs, which were originally intended to air until September 1991. The show was replaced by reruns of &quot;The Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Andy&quot;.

==Soundtracks==
The music for the show was provided by a diverse set of musicians, including Mark Mothersbaugh, The Residents, Todd Rundgren, Danny Elfman (who provided the score for both of the &quot;Pee-wee&quot; movies), Mitchell Froom, Van Dyke Parks, George S. Clinton, and Dweezil Zappa with Scott Thunes (spelled &#x27;Tunis&#x27; in the credits).

Mothersbaugh, who later went on to become a fixture in composing music for children&#x27;s shows like &quot;Rugrats&quot;, joined the show while on hiatus from recording with Devo. Said Mothersbaugh in 2006:

The opening prelude theme is an interpretation of Les Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Quiet Village&quot;. The theme song, which originally followed the prelude, was performed by Cyndi Lauper (credited as &quot;Ellen Shaw&quot;), imitating Betty Boop. For the final season in 1990, a new version of the prelude theme was recorded, and the opening theme was slightly edited.

==Cast and crew==
Many now-well-known TV and film actors appeared on the show, including Sandra Bernhard, Laurence Fishburne, Phil Hartman, Natasha Lyonne, S. Epatha Merkerson, Jimmy Smits, and Lynne Stewart. Future heavy metal musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie was a production assistant, and future filmmaker John Singleton was a security guard and production assistant.

The Christmas special episode, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse Christmas Special&quot;, aired between seasons 2 and 3 and included the regular cast, along with appearances by Annette Funicello, Frankie Avalon, Magic Johnson, Dinah Shore, Joan Rivers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Little Richard, Cher, Charo, k.d. lang, the Del Rubio triplets, and Grace Jones.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===
As soon as it first aired, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; fascinated media theorists and commentators, many of whom championed the show as a postmodernist hodgepodge of characters and situations that appeared to thumb its nose at the racist and sexist presumptions of dominant culture. For example, Pee-wee&#x27;s friends, both human and not, were of diverse cultural and racial origins. In a review of the first season for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John J. O&#x27;Connor called it &quot;undoubtedly this season&#x27;s most imaginative and disarming new series&quot;. O&#x27;Connor lauded the show&#x27;s mixed-media format and commented that the Saturday morning kids&#x27; programming of &quot;low-cost, dreary and occasionally questionable cartoons will never be the same&quot; after &quot;Pee-wee&quot;. Of Pee-wee, O&#x27;Connor said, &quot;He whips up a tightly contained world in which anything is possible as long as it doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone&quot;, and &quot;He&#x27;s sweetly looney and unpredictable, gentle yet always tip-toeing on the edge of devastating absurdity. He is a one-man force battling the plague of boredom that has settled on Saturday-morning programming for children.&quot; The show&#x27;s subversiveness and its &quot;apparent outbreak of playful queerness during the politically reactionary Reagan-Bush/Moral Majority years was a key factor of many adults&#x27; enjoyment of the show&quot;. &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;&#x27;s Bob Keeshan hailed the show&#x27;s &quot;awesome production values&quot;, adding, &quot;with the possible exception of the Muppets, you can&#x27;t find such creativity anywhere on TV.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m just trying to illustrate that it&#x27;s okay to be different¬†‚Äî not that it&#x27;s good, not that it&#x27;s bad, but that it&#x27;s all right. I&#x27;m trying to tell kids to have a good time and to encourage them to be creative and to question things,&quot; Reubens told an interviewer in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; was named to &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Best TV Shows.

On November 1, 2011, in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the show, a book by Caseen Gaines called &quot;Inside Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse: The Untold, Unauthorized, and Unpredictable Story of a Pop Phenomenon&quot;, was released by ECW Press.

In the wake of Reubens&#x27; death from cancer in 2023, John Jurgensen of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote: &quot;Pee-wee Herman wasn&#x27;t originally meant for kids. So when Paul Reubens did make a Saturday-morning TV show for them, his signature character came in a package shaped by underground art, punk rock and improv comedy.‚Å† As MTV was to cable and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; would soon be to prime-time, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; was a disrupter of the TV domain for kids. The show&#x27;s psychedelic absurdism also attracted an audience of teens, college students and savvy parents of the show&#x27;s target viewers. With his wild remix of the kids&#x27; shows that he grew up with as a baby boomer, Reubens put a stamp on Generation X.‚Å†&quot;

===DVD and Blu-Ray===
Image Entertainment first released all 45 episodes of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; on DVD in 2004. The DVDs were marketed as containing &quot;8 Lost shows&quot; (meaning episodes that hadn&#x27;t been released on video before). However, &quot;Stolen Apples&quot; had been first released on VHS from Hi-Tops Video in 1988 on the &quot;Festival of Fun&quot; tape.

On July 3, 2013, Shout! Factory announced that they had acquired the rights to the entire series from Paul Reubens, which was released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 21, 2014, the release went out of print several years later. Shout! Factory reissued the complete series Blu-ray on August 27th 2024. In addition, the entire series was digitally reconstructed from the original 16¬†mm film elements and original audio tracks, with some special effects recreated digitally. The restored episodes have also been made available on streaming platforms in May 2024.

<text>William Hamilton Maxwell (30 June 1792 in Newry, County Down, Ireland ‚Äì 29 December 1850 in Musselburgh, Scotland) was an Irish novelist, historian and clergyman.

==Biography==
===Early life and Career===
Maxwell William Hamilton, son of merchant James Maxwell and his wife, a daughter of William Hamilton, was born on June 30, 1792, in Market Street, Newry, County Down. Educated at David Henderson&#x27;s Newry school and also Trinity College, Dublin, where he commenced his tertiary learning. He claimed to have entered the British Army and seen service in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo, but this is generally believed to be untrue. Compelled by circumstances, he pursued a path in holy orders. After his ordination in 1813, he was first assigned to the humble curacy of Clonallon, overlooking Carlingford Bay.
Afterwards he took orders, but was deprived of his living for non-residence.

His novels, &quot;O&#x27;Hara&quot; (1825), and &quot;Stories from Waterloo&quot; (1834) started the school of rollicking military fiction, which culminated in the novels of Charles Lever. Maxwell also wrote a &quot;Life of the Duke of Wellington&quot; (1839‚Äì1841), and a &quot;History of the Irish Rebellion of 1798&quot; (1845) - written in a spirit hostile to the rebels, and accompanied with similarly hostile illustrations by George Cruikshank.

Maxwell married Mary Dobbin, daughter of Thomas Dobbin.

===Death===
On December 29, 1850, William Hamilton Maxwell passed away in Musselburgh, Scotland. He was fifty-five years old.

<text>Lorna Luft (born November 21, 1952) is an American actress and singer. She is the daughter of Judy Garland and Sidney Luft, the sister of Joey Luft and the half-sister of Liza Minnelli.

==Early life==
Luft was born on November 21, 1952, at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California to Judy Garland and Garland&#x27;s third husband, Sidney Luft. She attended University High School in Los Angeles during her senior year and was a member of the school choir. She studied theatre at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==
===Stage and television===
Luft made her show business debut at age 11, singing &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town&quot; on the 1963 Christmas episode of Garland&#x27;s CBS television series &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;. Siblings Liza Minnelli and Joey Luft also appeared. Garland sang the song &quot;Lorna&quot; to Luft on episode 20 of &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; in 1964: an original number composed by Mort Lindsey and Johnny Mercer especially for Luft at Garland&#x27;s request. The song was later featured on the 2006 Garland compilation &quot;Great Day! Rare Recordings from the Judy Garland Show&quot;.

Luft soon joined the family act on a summer concert tour, the highlight of which was Garland&#x27;s third and final appearance at New York&#x27;s famed Palace Theatre on Broadway in 1967, two years before her mother&#x27;s death. In this month-long engagement, Garland &quot;shared&quot; the bill with Luft (then 14 years old) and Joey (12 years old). The show was recorded live and released on ABC Records as &quot;Judy Garland at Home at the Palace&quot;.

Luft made her Broadway debut in 1971 at the Shubert Theatre as a replacement cast member in the musical &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, adapted from the classic 1960 Billy Wilder film &quot;The Apartment&quot;. It is best known for the hit song &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;.

On October 7, 1981, Luft performed at Carnegie Hall in New York, which was said to be the culmination of a lifelong dream. She starred in the 1981‚Äì82 national tour of &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;, and in 1982 she played Paulette Rebchuck in &quot;Grease 2&quot;. In 1983, she played Peppermint Patty in the off-Broadway production of &quot;Snoopy! The Musical&quot;, a sequel to &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;. Later that year, she costarred in &quot;Extremities&quot; with Farrah Fawcett.

Luft appeared as Nurse Libby Kegler on the CBS television series &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; during its final season of 1985‚Äì1986. She also appeared as Patti Bristol in &quot;Broadway Malady&quot;, a 1985 episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. In the episode, Luft played the daughter of Vivian Blaine, who had originated the role of Adelaide in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; on Broadway, while Luft would go on to play the same role in the 1992‚Äì1994 national and worldwide tours.

In 1996, Luft appeared in an Irish production of &quot;Follies&quot; in Dublin with Mary Millar, Alex Sharpe, Christine Scarry, Aidan Conway, Enda Markey, Dave Willetts and Millicent Martin. In 2002, she starred as Mama Rose in a University of Richmond school production of &quot;Gypsy.&quot;

In December 1995, Luft released a cover version of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, which was reworked as a &quot;virtual duet&quot; with Garland. Produced by Gordon Lorenz, it was issued as a CD single only in the U.K. by the Carlton Sounds label. A music video featured Luft performing the song in a studio interspersed with classic footage of Garland singing to a then-11-year-old Luft on the 1963 Christmas episode of &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;, all placed on the same screen.

From November 2006 through January 2007, Luft performed in the U.K. premiere of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot;, a new stage adaptation based on the film. She reprised her role the next year, playing the Edinburgh Playhouse from November 19 to December 8, 2007, and the Wales Millennium Centre at the Donald Gordon Theatre from December 13, 2007, through January 12, 2008.

Luft appeared in four episodes of the 2007‚Äì2009 Logo animated series &quot;Rick &amp; Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World&quot;.

In October 2007, Luft released her debut album &quot;Lorna Luft: Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot; in the U.K. Produced by Barry Manilow and Luft&#x27;s husband Colin R. Freeman, the album celebrates Garland&#x27;s music. To promote the album, Luft appeared on the 29th October 2007 edition of the Ken Bruce Show on BBC Radio 2. She took part in Celebrity Popmaster. In 2005, Luft toured Ireland with her stage show, &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot;. In June 2006, she surprised audiences at Carnegie Hall by performing a duet with Rufus Wainwright on the song &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot; at the end of Wainwright&#x27;s tribute concert for Garland&#x27;s triumphant 1961 comeback at the same venue.

Luft appeared in &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;, a stage version of the movie that made Garland famous, at The Lowry in Manchester, England. She portrayed the role of the Wicked Witch of the West (played by Margaret Hamilton in the film).

In April 2009, Luft completed a successful U.K. tour of the critically acclaimed Hugh Whitemore play &quot;Pack of Lies&quot;, where she played the role of Helen Kroger, starring alongside Jenny Seagrove, Simon Shepherd, and Daniel Hill. In May 2009 she appeared in &quot;W&quot; magazine as a special guest performer for the acclaimed avant-garde Theo Adams Company&#x27;s latest project, &quot;Performance&quot;, photographed by David Sims. In July 2009, she appeared at the Mermaid Theatre, London to record for the radio series &quot;Friday Night Is Music Night&quot;. &quot;Lorna Luft and Friends ‚Äì A Tribute to Judy Garland&quot; also featured John Barrowman, Frances Ruffelle, and Linzi Hateley.

Between May and July 2015, Luft toured the U.K. in &quot;Judy - The Songbook of Judy Garland&quot;, a show highlighting Garland&#x27;s life and music. The show featured her signature songs and recreations of film scenes from her MGM years.

===Film===
Luft has appeared in the films &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982), &quot;Where the Boys Are &#x27;84&quot; (1984), &quot;Fear Stalk&quot; (1989), &quot;54&quot; (1998) and &quot;My Giant&quot; (1998). She and her brother Joey made cameo appearances in the 1963 film &quot;I Could Go On Singing&quot;.

===Author===
Luft is the author of the 1998 book &quot;Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir&quot;. Among its revelations is the fact that she had an affair with Barry Manilow in 1971. In 2001, the book was adapted as an Emmy-winning TV miniseries titled &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot;. It stars Judy Davis as the adult Judy, Tammy Blanchard as the teenage Judy, Hugh Laurie as Vincente Minnelli, Victor Garber as Sid Luft, and Marsha Mason as Ethel Gumm. Luft is the co-author, along with film historian Jeffrey Vance, of the 2018 book &quot;A Star Is Born: Judy Garland and the Film That Got Away&quot;, which she states is &quot;a vivid account of the film classic&#x27;s production, loss, and reclamation.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Luft participates in events which are held by various children&#x27;s and AIDS-related charities, including the annual Los Angeles AIDS Walk and The Children&#x27;s Wish Foundation International. Luft and her first husband Jerry Mamberg, also known as Jake Hooker, divorced in 1993. They had two children together, a son, Jesse, a daughter, Vanessa, and have four grandchildren. She currently resides in Palm Springs, California, with her second husband, the British-born composer and arranger, Colin Freeman.

==Health==
Luft was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and she finished her last chemotherapy treatment in 2013. Two years later, the U.K. tour of &quot;Judy - The Songbook of Judy Garland&quot; concluded early on July 11, 2015, and she returned to the U.S. for surgical treatment following a re-emergence of the breast cancer.

In March 2018, Luft was diagnosed with a brain tumor after she collapsed following a performance in London.
Later that month, Luft underwent successful surgery to remove the tumor.

<text>Carrie Frances Fisher (October 21, 1956 ‚Äì December 27, 2016) was an American actress and writer. She played Princess Leia in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films (1977‚Äì1983) and reprised the role in&quot; Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), a posthumous release that was dedicated to her, and &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), through the use of unreleased footage from &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. Her other film credits include &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975), &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; (1989), &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; (1989), &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Women&quot; (2008). She was nominated twice for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performances in the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2007) and the Channel 4 series &quot;Catastrophe&quot; (2017).

Fisher wrote several semi-autobiographical novels, including &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; and an autobiographical one-woman play, and its nonfiction book, &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot;, based on the play. She wrote the screenplay for the film version of &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; which garnered her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and her one-woman stage show of &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot; received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special. She worked on other writers&#x27; screenplays as a script doctor, including tightening the scripts for &quot;Hook&quot; (1991), &quot;Sister Act&quot; (1992), &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; (1998), and many of the films from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, among others. An &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; article from May 1992 described Fisher as &quot;one of the most sought-after doctors in town.&quot;

Fisher was the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds. She and her mother appear together in &quot;Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds&quot;, a documentary about their relationship. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. She earned praise for speaking publicly about her experiences with bipolar disorder and drug addiction. Fisher died of a sudden cardiac arrest in December 2016, at age 60, four days after experiencing a medical emergency during a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles. She was posthumously made a Disney Legend in 2017, and was awarded a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album the following year. In 2023, she posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 

==Early life==
Carrie Frances Fisher was born on October 21, 1956, at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, to actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher. Fisher&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Russian-Jewish immigrants, while her mother, who was raised a Nazarene, was of English and Scots-Irish descent.

Fisher was two years old when her parents divorced in 1959 after it was revealed shortly following the death of Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s husband, Mike Todd, that Eddie Fisher had been having an affair with her. Eddie Fisher and Taylor married that same year and divorced in 1964. Her father&#x27;s third marriage, to actress Connie Stevens, resulted in the births of Fisher&#x27;s two half-sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher. In 1960, her mother married Harry Karl, owner of a chain of shoe stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=102ECnUpupkC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds and Karl divorced in 1973 when Fisher was 17 years old.

Fisher &quot;hid in books&quot; as a child, becoming known in her family as &quot;the bookworm&quot;. She spent her earliest years reading classic literature and writing poetry. She attended Beverly Hills High School until age 16, when she appeared as a debutante and singer in the hit Broadway revival &quot;Irene&quot; (1973), also starring her mother. Her time on Broadway interfered with her education, resulting in her dropping out of high school. In 1973, she enrolled at London&#x27;s Central School of Speech and Drama, which she attended for 18 months. Following her time there, she was accepted at Sarah Lawrence College, where she planned to study the arts. She later left without graduating.

==Career==
===1970s===

Fisher made her film debut in 1975 as the precociously seductive character Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy &quot;Shampoo&quot;, filmed in mid-1974, when she was age 17. In¬†1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas&#x27; space-fantasy film &quot;Star Wars&quot; (later retitled &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV ‚Äì A New Hope&quot;) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.

In April 1978, Fisher appeared as the love interest in Ringo Starr&#x27;s 1978 TV special &quot;Ringo&quot;. The next month, she starred alongside John Ritter (who had also appeared in &quot;Ringo&quot;) in the ABC-TV film &quot;Leave Yesterday Behind.&quot; At this time, Fisher appeared with Laurence Olivier and Joanne Woodward in the anthology series &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot; in a television version of the William Inge play &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;. That November, she played Princess Leia in the 1978 TV production &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;, and sang in the last scene.

===1980s===
Fisher appeared in the film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; as Jake&#x27;s vengeful ex-lover; she is listed in the credits as &quot;Mystery Woman&quot;. While Fisher was in Chicago filming the movie, she choked on a Brussels sprout; Dan Aykroyd performed the Heimlich maneuver which &quot;saved my life&quot;, according to Fisher. She appeared on Broadway in &quot;Censored Scenes from King Kong&quot; in 1980. The same year, she reprised her role as Princess Leia in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and appeared with her &quot;Star Wars&quot; co-stars on the cover of the July 12, 1980, issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to promote the film. She also starred as Sister Agnes in the Broadway production of &quot;Agnes of God&quot; in 1983, a run which overlapped with her mother&#x27;s appearance in the Broadway company of &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;.

In 1983, Fisher returned to the role of Princess Leia in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and posed in the character&#x27;s metal bikini on the cover of the Summer 1983 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to promote the film. The costume later achieved a following of its own. In 1986, she starred along with Barbara Hershey and Mia Farrow in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;.

In 1987, Fisher published her first novel, &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot;. The book was semi-autobiographical in the sense that she fictionalized and satirized real-life events such as her drug addiction of the late 1970s and her relationship with her mother. It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film &quot;The Time Guardian&quot;. In 1989, Fisher played a major supporting role in &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;, and in the same year she appeared with Tom Hanks as his character&#x27;s wife in &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot;.

===1990s===
In 1990, Columbia Pictures released a film version of &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot;, adapted for the screen by Fisher and starring Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, and Dennis Quaid. Fisher appeared in the fantasy comedy film &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot; in 1991, and played a therapist in &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997). During the 1990s, Fisher also published the novels &quot;Surrender the Pink&quot; (1990) and &quot;Delusions of Grandma&quot; (1993). Fisher wrote an episode of the television sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; entitled &quot;Arsenic and Old Mom&quot;, in which her mother Debbie Reynolds made a guest appearance. Fisher also did uncredited script work for movies such as &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; (where she wrote some of Rene Russo&#x27;s dialogue), &quot;Outbreak&quot; (also starring Russo), &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, and &quot;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&quot;.

===2000s===
In the 2000 film &quot;Scream 3&quot;, Fisher played a former actress who acknowledges she looks like Fisher, and in 2001 she played a nun in the Kevin Smith comedy &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;. She also co-wrote the TV comedy film &quot;These Old Broads&quot; (2001), of which she was also co-executive producer. It starred her mother Debbie Reynolds, as well as Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, and Shirley MacLaine. In 2003 Fisher played Mother Superior, another nun, in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle.&quot;

In addition to acting and writing original works, Fisher was one of the top script doctors in Hollywood, working on the screenplays of other writers. She did uncredited polishes on movies in a 15-year stretch from 1991 to 2005. She was hired by George Lucas to polish scripts for his 1992 TV series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; and the dialogue for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel scripts. Her expertise in this area was the reason she was chosen as one of the interviewers for the screenwriting documentary &quot;Dreams on Spec&quot; in 2007. In an interview in 2004, Fisher said she no longer did much script doctoring.

Fisher also voiced Peter Griffin&#x27;s boss, Angela, on the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot; and wrote the introduction for a book of photographs titled &quot;Hollywood Moms&quot;, which was published in 2001. Fisher published a sequel to &quot;Postcards&quot;, &quot;The Best Awful There Is&quot;, in 2004. In 2005, Women in Film &amp; Video ‚Äì DC recognized Fisher with the Women of Vision Award.

Fisher wrote and performed in her one-woman play &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot; at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles from November 2006 to January 2007. Her show then played throughout 2008 at the Berkeley Repertory Theater, San Jose, the Hartford Stage, the Arena Stage and Boston. Fisher published her autobiographical book, also titled &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot;, based on her successful play in December 2008 and embarked on a media tour. In 2009, Fisher returned to the stage with her play at the Seattle Repertory Theatre. &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot; then opened on Broadway in New York at Studio 54 and played an extended run from October 2009 until January 2010. In December 2009, Fisher&#x27;s audiobook recording of &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot; earned her a nomination for a 2009 Grammy Award in the Best Spoken Word Album category.

Fisher joined Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne on Saturday evenings in 2007 for &quot;The Essentials&quot; with informative and entertaining conversation on Hollywood&#x27;s best films. She guest-starred in the episode titled &quot;Sex and Another City&quot; from season 3 of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; with Sarah Jessica Parker. On October 25, 2007, Fisher guest-starred as Rosemary Howard on the second-season episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot; called &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, for which she received an Emmy Award nomination. On April 28, 2008, she was a guest on &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. In 2008, she also had a cameo as a doctor in the &quot;Star Wars&quot;-related comedy &quot;Fanboys&quot;.

When asked if she was still working as a script doctor in December 2008, she said: &quot;I haven&#x27;t done it for a few years. I did it for many years, and then younger people came to do it and I started to do new things. It was a long, very lucrative episode of my life. But it&#x27;s complicated to do that. Now it&#x27;s all changed, actually. Now in order to get a rewrite job, you have to submit your notes for your ideas on how to fix the script. So they can get all the notes from all the different writers, keep the notes and not hire you. That&#x27;s free work and that&#x27;s what I always call life-wasting events.&quot;

===2010s===
In 2010, HBO aired a feature-length documentary based on a special live performance of Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot; stage production. At the time of her death, Fisher had been preparing a sequel to the one-woman play.

Fisher appeared on the seventh season of &quot;Entourage&quot; in the summer of 2010. She was among the featured performers at the &quot;Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne&quot;, which aired in August 2012. In her monologue, Fisher poked fun at her own mental illness, and her fellow roasters&#x27; reliance on weight and menopause jokes. Fisher joked that she had no idea why she was asked to roast Roseanne, until &quot;they explained that we were actually good friends, and that apparently we have worked together.&quot; Host Jane Lynch joked that Fisher was there to add perspective to Roseanne&#x27;s struggles with weight and drugs. Fellow roaster Wayne Brady poked fun at Fisher&#x27;s career, saying she was the only celebrity &quot;whose action figure is worth more than you are.&quot;

She was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Venice Film Festival. She filmed an appearance on the UK comedy panel show &quot;QI&quot; that was broadcast on December 25, 2014. Fisher starred alongside Sharon Horgan and comedian Rob Delaney in the British comedy series &quot;Catastrophe&quot;, that was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on January 19, 2015. Her last appearance on &quot;Catastrophe&quot;, which aired in the UK on April 4, 2017, left many viewers in tears and earned her a posthumous Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination.

In a March 2013 interview following the announcement that a new trilogy of films would be produced, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in &quot;Episode VII&quot; of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. Fisher claimed that Leia was &quot;Elderly. She&#x27;s in an intergalactic old folks&#x27; home [laughs]. I just think she would be just like she was before, only slower and less inclined to be up for the big battle.&quot; After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said the same day that Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.

In a January 2014 interview, Fisher confirmed her involvement and the involvement of the original cast in the upcoming sequels by saying &quot;as for the next &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, myself, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are expected to report to work in March or April. I&#x27;d like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I think that would be funny.&quot;

In March 2014, Fisher stated that she was moving to London for six months because that was where &quot;Star Wars Episode VII&quot; filming would take place. On April 29, 2014, the cast for the new sequel was officially announced, and Fisher, along with Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, and Kenny Baker, were all cast in their original roles for the film. &quot;Star Wars Episode VII&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, was released worldwide on December 18, 2015. Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal.

In &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), which is set just before the original trilogy, young versions of Leia and the Peter Cushing character Grand Moff Tarkin appear through computer animation. Fisher had completed filming her role as Leia in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017) shortly before her death. Director Rian Johnson has stated that many of Fisher&#x27;s own ideas made it into the film, and that she supplied a few of Leia&#x27;s lines. Fisher appeared posthumously in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019) via unreleased footage from &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;.

Fisher&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Princess Diarist&quot;, was released in November 2016. The book is based on diaries she kept while filming the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Her audiobook recording of the memoir earned her the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album, awarded 13 months after her death.

Fisher and her mother appear in &quot;Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds&quot;, a 2016 documentary about their close relationship featuring interviews, photographs and home movies. The documentary premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and was broadcast on January 7, 2017.

Fisher appeared as herself in the final episode of series 1 of &quot;Urban Myths&quot; (2017) but the episode was never broadcast following objections by the Jackson family to Joseph Fiennes&#x27; portrayal of Michael Jackson in the episode.

=== 2020s ===
Fisher was featured in the film &quot;Wonderwell&quot; with Rita Ora, which was filmed in mid-2016 in Italy; it received a limited theatrical release on June 23, 2023, followed by a digital release.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===
In her 2016 autobiography &quot;The Princess Diarist&quot;, Fisher wrote that she and Harrison Ford had a three-month affair during the filming of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1976.

Fisher met musician Paul Simon through her friend actress Shelley Duvall in 1978, and the pair began dating.

In 1980, she was briefly engaged to Canadian actor and comedian Dan Aykroyd, who proposed to her on the set of their film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. She said: &quot;We had rings, we got blood tests, the whole shot. But then I got back together with Paul Simon.&quot;

Fisher was married to Simon from August 1983 to July 1984, and they dated again for a time after their divorce. During their marriage, she appeared in Simon&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War&quot;. Simon&#x27;s song &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; is about their romance, and she is referred to in his song &quot;Graceland&quot;, which was written after their divorce. Fisher said she felt privileged to appear in Simon&#x27;s songs.

Fisher subsequently had a relationship with the Creative Artists Agency&#x27;s principal talent agent, Bryan Lourd. Their only child, Billie Lourd, was born in 1992. Eddie Fisher stated in his autobiography (&quot;Been There Done That&quot;) that his granddaughter&#x27;s name is Catherine Fisher Lourd and her nickname is &quot;Billy&quot;. Carrie Fisher&#x27;s relationship with Bryan Lourd ended when he left her for a man. In interviews, Fisher described Lourd as her second husband, but a 2004 profile revealed that she and Lourd were never legally married.

Fisher had a close relationship with English singer-songwriter James Blunt. While working on his album &quot;Back to Bedlam&quot; in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher&#x27;s residence. When &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: &quot;Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster and he gets &#x27;fight or flight.&#x27; You know, he comes from a long line of soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James&#x27; therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient.&quot;

On February 26, 2005, R. Gregory &quot;Greg&quot; Stevens, a 42-year-old lobbyist, was found dead in Fisher&#x27;s California home. The final autopsy report listed the cause of death as &quot;cocaine and oxycodone use&quot; but added chronic and apparently previously undiagnosed heart disease as contributing factors. Media coverage of an initial autopsy report used the word &quot;overdose&quot;, but that wording is not in the final report. In an interview, Fisher claimed that Stevens&#x27; ghost haunted her mansion, which unsettled her: &quot;I was a nut for a year, and in that year I took drugs again.&quot;

In her later years, Fisher had an emotional support animal, a French bulldog named Gary, that she brought to numerous appearances and interviews. Following her death, reports indicated that Fisher&#x27;s daughter Billie Lourd would take care of Gary.

===Advocacy===
Fisher described herself as an &quot;enthusiastic agnostic who would be happy to be shown that there is a God.&quot; She was raised Protestant, but often attended Jewish services (her father&#x27;s faith) with Jewish Orthodox friends.

In 2016, Harvard College gave Fisher its Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism, noting that &quot;her forthright activism and outspokenness about addiction, mental illness, and agnosticism have advanced public discourse on these issues with creativity and empathy.&quot;

Fisher was a supporter and advocate for several causes, including women&#x27;s advocacy, animal rights, and LGBT causes. She was open about her experiences caring for friends who had AIDS, contributing financially to various AIDS and HIV organizations, including hosting a benefit for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. She also served as an honorary board member for the International Bipolar Foundation, and, in 2014, received the Golden Heart Award for her work with The Midnight Mission.

She was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig weight loss television ads that aired in January 2011.

===Bipolar disorder and drug use===
During appearances on &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive&quot; with Stephen Fry, Fisher publicly discussed her diagnosis of bipolar disorder and her addictions to cocaine and prescription medication. She said her drug use was a form of self-medication; she used pain medication such as Percodan to &quot;dial down&quot; the manic aspect of her bipolar disorder. She gave nicknames to her bipolar moods: Roy (&quot;the wild ride of a mood&quot;) and Pam (&quot;who stands on the shore and sobs&quot;). &quot;Drugs made me feel more normal&quot;, she explained to &quot;Psychology Today&quot; in 2001. &quot;They contained me.&quot; She discussed her 2008 memoir &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot; and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; that same year, and also revealed that she would have turned down the role of Princess Leia had she realized it would give her the celebrity status that made her parents&#x27; lives difficult. This interview was followed by a similar appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments. At one point, she received ECT every six weeks to &quot;blow apart the cement&quot; in her brain. In 2014, she said she was no longer receiving the treatment. Her 2011 book &quot;Shockaholic&quot; describes these treatments.

In another interview, Fisher revealed that she used cocaine during the filming of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. &quot;Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter&quot;, she noted. In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed on a combination of prescription medication and sleeping pills. She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot;. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story&#x27;s protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, &quot;I&#x27;ve already played Suzanne.&quot;

==Death==
After finishing the European leg of her book tour (her last TV appearance was on an episode of &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; in the United Kingdom, broadcast December 21, 2016), Fisher was on a commercial flight on December 23, 2016, from London to Los Angeles when she had a medical emergency around fifteen minutes before the aircraft landed. A passenger seated near Fisher reported that she had stopped breathing; another passenger performed CPR on Fisher until paramedics arrived at the scene. Emergency services in Los Angeles were contacted when the flight crew reported a passenger unresponsive prior to landing. Fisher was taken by ambulance to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she was placed on a ventilator.

On the morning of December 27, 2016, after being in intensive care for four days, Fisher died at the age of 60 at the UCLA Medical Center. Fisher&#x27;s daughter, Billie Lourd, confirmed her mother&#x27;s death in a statement to the press. Many of her co-stars and directors from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and other works also shared their thoughts on her death.

On January 9, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a death certificate that stated &quot;cardiac arrest/deferred&quot; as the cause of death, with more tests to be expected. In a June 16, 2017 news release, the Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s office said that the exact cause of death could not be determined, but sleep apnea and the buildup of fatty tissue on the walls of arteries were among the contributing factors. A full report from June 19, 2017, stated that Fisher had cocaine in her system, as well as traces of heroin, other opiates, and MDMA. The report also stated that the investigation was unable to determine when she had taken the drugs and whether they contributed to her death. Her daughter stated that Fisher &quot;battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life. She ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases... I know my Mom, she&#x27;d want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles.&quot; In her 2008 work &quot;Wishful Drinking,&quot; Fisher wrote that &quot;no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.&quot; After Fisher&#x27;s death, several news sources and magazines honored her request in their obituaries, with &quot;Bustle&quot; featuring a fantastical reimagining of Fisher&#x27;s last moments as an ascent into space.

On December 28, 2016, the day after Fisher&#x27;s death, her mother, Debbie Reynolds, had a stroke at the home of her son, Todd, where the family was planning Fisher&#x27;s burial arrangements. She was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she died later that afternoon. According to Todd, Reynolds had said, &quot;I want to be with Carrie&quot; immediately before she had the stroke. On January 5, 2017, a joint private memorial was held for Fisher and Reynolds. Fisher was cremated while her mother was entombed. A portion of Fisher&#x27;s ashes was placed beside Reynolds in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills. The remainder of those ashes are held in a giant novelty Prozac pill.

== Legacy ==
In the absence of a star for Fisher on the Hollywood Walk of Fame after her death, fans created their own memorial using a blank star. Along with flowers and candles, words put on the blank star read, &quot;Carrie Fisher¬†/ May The Force Be With You Always¬†/ Hope&quot;. Fans also gathered at the Yoda Fountain outside the Lucasfilm offices in San Francisco. In June 2021, it was announced that Fisher would receive an official star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2022. She received the star on Star Wars Day 2023. 

In the video game &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, thousands of fans paid tribute to Fisher by gathering at House Organa on the planet Alderaan where Fisher&#x27;s character in &quot;Star Wars&quot; was raised. Lightsaber vigils and similar events in Fisher&#x27;s honor were held at various Alamo Drafthouse Cinema theaters and other sites. On January 6, 2017, the lights on Broadway in Manhattan were darkened for one minute in honor of Fisher and her mother. Fisher and Reynolds were also both featured in the 89th Academy Awards &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment. On March 25, 2017, a public memorial for mother and daughter was held at the Hall of Liberty theater in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The event was streamed live on Reynolds&#x27; website. On April 14, a special tribute to Fisher was held by Mark Hamill during the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration in Orlando. The 2017 film &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; was dedicated to her memory. On October 27, 2023, James Blunt released an album including a track called &quot;Dark Thought&quot; about the death of Fisher, who was a friend of his.

== Filmography ==

During her almost five-decade-long career, Fisher had appearances in over 50 films, as well as various television series, documentaries, late night talk shows, video games, and commercials. Her credits also include writing novels, screenplays, television specials and series episodes.

<text>William Hone (3 June 1780 ‚Äì 8 November 1842) was an English writer, satirist and bookseller. His victorious court battle against government censorship in 1817 marked a turning point in the fight for British press freedom.

==Biography==
Hone has been described as one of the fathers of modern media. According to Associate Professor Kyle Grimes from the University of Alabama, &quot;William Hone arguably did more than any other writer, printer or publisher to shape British popular print culture in the early decades of the nineteenth century.&quot;

Hone was born at Bath on 3 June 1780, one of three children to William Hone Senior (born at Homewood Farm in Ripley, Surrey) and Francis Stalwell. William&#x27;s only surviving brother, Joseph Hone (1784‚Äì1861) was a Supreme Court judge in Tasmania, Australia.

William was an inquisitive child, whose father taught him to read from the Bible. For a number of years William attended a small school run by Dame Bettridge, to whom he was very close.

In 1783, William&#x27;s father moved to London and found work in an Attorney&#x27;s office. He encouraged William Junior to follow in this profession. After two-and-a-half years in the office of a solicitor at Chatham, William Hone Junior returned to London to become clerk to a solicitor at Gray&#x27;s Inn. He disliked the law as a profession and said he spent more time reading than working for his employer. With an increasing interest in socialism, he joined the London Corresponding Society in 1796. One of the key campaigns of this Society was to gain the vote for working men. Deeply unpopular with the Government, who were not in favour of Parliamentary reform, some members were tried for treason and sedition.

Hone was married in 1800 to Sarah Johnson. From 1801 to 1825 they had 12 children. With money given to him by his mother-in-law, he started a book and print shop with a circulating library in Lambeth Walk. He soon moved close to St Martin-in-the-Fields, where he published &quot;Shaw&#x27;s Gardener&quot; (1806). It was at this time that he and his friend, John Bone, tried to establish a popular savings bank. Despite the backing of various wealthy patrons, they were unsuccessful. Bone then joined Hone in a bookseller&#x27;s business, which was also unsuccessful.

In 1811, Hone was employed as an auctioneer for London booksellers. During this time he expanded his interest in journalism and embarked on investigations into the condition of patients in mental asylums. His investigations into the treatment of inmates at Bethlem Hospital (&quot;Bedlam&quot;) outraged the public and politicians alike and consequently Bedlam&#x27;s Governor resigned. Around this time Hone took a small lodging in the Old Bailey, keeping himself and his growing family by contributions to magazines and reviews. He hired a small shop in Fleet Street but this was twice robbed, with valuable books placed on show stolen.

In 1815 he started the &quot;Traveller&quot; newspaper, and tried in vain to save Elizabeth Fenning, a cook convicted on thin evidence of poisoning her employers with arsenic. Although Fenning was executed, Hone&#x27;s 240-page book on the subject, &quot;The Important Results of an Elaborate Investigation into the Mysterious Case of Eliza Fenning&quot; ‚Äì widely considered a landmark in investigative journalism ‚Äì demolished the prosecution&#x27;s case.

From 1 February to 25 October 1817, Hone published the &quot;Reformists&#x27; Register&quot;, using it to criticise state abuses, which he later attacked in the famous political squibs and parodies, illustrated by George Cruikshank. At the time of publishing the Register, Hone mentions his office as Number 67, Old Bailey, three doors from Ludgate Hill. In April 1817 three ex-officio accusations were filed against him by the attorney-general, Sir William Garrow. Three separate trials took place in the Guildhall before special juries on 18, 19 and 20 December 1817. The first, for publishing &quot;The Late John Wilkes&#x27;s Catechism of a Ministerial Member&quot; (1817), was before Mr Justice Abbot (afterwards Lord Tenterden); the second, for parodying the litany and libelling the Prince Regent in &quot;The Political Litany&quot; (1817), and the third, for publishing the &quot;Sinecurist&#x27;s Creed&quot; (1817), a parody on the Athanasian Creed, were before Lord Ellenborough.

The prosecution took the ground that the prints were harmful to public morals and brought the prayer-book and even religion itself into contempt. The real motives of the prosecution were political: Hone had ridiculed the habits and exposed the corruption of those in power. He went to the root of the matter when he wished the jury &quot;to understand that, had he been a publisher of ministerial parodies, he would not then have been defending himself on the floor of that court.&quot; In spite of illness and exhaustion Hone spoke on each of the three days for about seven hours. Although his judges were biased against him, he was acquitted on each count, and the result was received enthusiastically by immense crowds inside and outside the court. During this time, Hone was considered the most famous man in England. Soon afterwards, a public collection was made on his behalf. A recent play about the 1817 trials, &quot;Trial by Laughter&quot;, was written by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman. It began its run in English theatres in September 2018.

Among Hone&#x27;s most successful political satires were &quot;The Political house that Jack built&quot; (1819), &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Matrimonial Ladder&quot; (1820), &quot;Ill favour of Queen Caroline&quot;, &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; (1820) and &quot;The Political Showman&quot; (1821), all illustrated by Cruikshank. Many of his squibs are directed against a certain &quot;Dr Slop&quot;, a nickname given by him to Dr (afterwards Sir John) Stoddart, publisher of &quot;The Times&quot;. In researching his defence Hone had come upon some curious and, at that time, little trodden literary ground, and the results were shown by his publication in 1820 of &quot;The Apocryphal New Testament: being all the Gospels, Epistles, and other pieces now extant, attributed in the first four centuries to Jesus Christ, his Apostles and their companions, and not included in the New Testament by its compilers; translated from the original tongues, and now first collected into one volume&quot;. This book has gone through four editions and many reprints, including e-books and microforms, the latest in 2007. In 1823 he published the &quot;Ancient Mysteries Explained&quot;, in 1826 the &quot;Every-day Book&quot;, in 1827‚Äì1828 the &quot;Table-Book&quot;, and in 1829 the &quot;Year-Book&quot;. All three were collections of curious information on manners, antiquities and various other subjects.

&quot;The Every-day Book&quot;, &quot;Table Book&quot; and &quot;Year Book&quot; are the works by which Hone is best remembered. In preparing them he had the approval of Robert Southey and the assistance of Charles Lamb, (with whom he was great friends) as well as his son-in-law, Jacob Henry Burn (1794‚Äì1869). Despite the popularity of these books, Hone was not financially successful, and was lodged in King&#x27;s Bench Prison for a short period for outstanding debts. Friends came to his assistance, and he subsequently opened the Green Grasshopper coffee house with his wife and two eldest daughters in Gracechurch Street. By this time Hone&#x27;s attitude towards religion had changed, and during the latter years of his life he became a follower of Rev. Thomas Binney. In 1830 Hone edited Strutt&#x27;s &quot;Sports and Pastimes of the people of England&quot;, and contributed to the first edition of &quot;The Penny Magazine&quot;. He was also sub-editor of &quot;The Patriot&quot;. After a series of strokes, he died at Tottenham on 8 November 1842 and was buried at Dr Watts&#x27; Walk in Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington. Besides his immediate family, his funeral was attended by his long-term collaborator George Cruikshank and the acclaimed author Charles Dickens.

==Legacy==
There are many books available on Hone&#x27;s life and career. In the years before his death, he and his eldest daughter, Sarah Burn, worked together to compile his personal papers and information in order to put together a biography. Sarah transcribed while William spoke. They were not successful in achieving a published work; however, the compilation of documents was given to writer Frederick Hackworth by Hone&#x27;s younger daughter Ellen Soul. Hackworth then published the book &quot;William Hone. His life and times&quot; in 1912.

In an 1872 letter to the editor of the Australasian newspaper, Sarah, now living in Melbourne, Australia, said of her father: My father was gifted with a high sense of justice and truth, a brave energy, and force of character that knew no fear, and the greater the obstructions to his object, the more determined his perseverance. His exertions were frequently devoted to the relief of private wrong, as well as of public oppression. To his untiring persistence may be ascribed the release of the cruelly incarcerated lunatic W. Norris, who had been for years chained to an iron frame in a cell in Bethlem, followed by a general reform of treatment and the eventual dismissal of the governor, W. Haslam about 1813.

In his prolonged efforts to save the life of the unfortunate Eliza Fenning he was not so successful. She had been tried for poisoning the family of Mr Turner, a law stationer in Chancery Lane. While waiting sentence my father conversed with her in Newgate, and became so convinced of her innocence that he spared no exertions day or night on her behalf, collected a mass of evidence (which he afterwards printed‚Äîa volume of about 200 pages) in her favour, had a petition presented to the Secretary of State praying for reprieve but the judge who tried her, Sir Vicary Gibbs, recorder of London, a notoriously hard man, and an intimate friend of the Turners, had charged the jury vindictively against her, and he pursued the unhappy girl to the scaffold. Years after, Mrs Turner, when dying confessed herself to have been the murderess.

Of retiring habits, simple yet refined tastes and courteous manners, my father was essentially a gentleman and while he had an utter contempt of such as Mr Thackeray termed &#x27;stuck-up people, he instinctively conceded to every rank of life its due proprieties. His society was courted for the attractiveness of his conversation, in which few excelled, and he numbered among his friends many eminent in art, sciences and the learned professions as well as in literature.

A short biography of Hone&#x27;s life written by his friend and sometime neighbour, Frances Rolleston, was published five years after his death, a revised edition six years later, under the title &quot;Some Account of the Conversion from Atheism to Christianity of the Late William Hone&quot;.

The medieval scholar M. R. James sharply criticized Hone&#x27;s &quot;The apocryphal New Testament&quot; as &quot;to speak frankly, a very bad book&quot; on a number of grounds: it republished the 1700s translations of Archbishop Wake and Jeremiah Jones without crediting them; it misleadingly presented apocrypha as if a supplement to the New Testament; it combined non-apocryphal works of the early Church Fathers with anonymous apocryphal works without any clarification or distinction; and so on. James did admit that Hone&#x27;s book was his first exposure to such works and kindled a fondness for it in spite of its flaws, and published his own collection of New Testament apocrypha in 1924 in the hopes of replacing Hone&#x27;s version.

The Australian Brian Hone is a descendant of William&#x27;s via his son Alfred Hone, a sculptor. The Hone&#x27;s youngest daughter Alice was married to the French furniture designer Henri Auguste Fourdinois, the son of .

<doc id="314477" wikidata="Q2061388" url="?curid=314477" title="Paul Muldoon">
<text>Paul Muldoon is an Irish poet. He has published more than thirty collections and won a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the T. S. Eliot Prize. At Princeton University he has been both the Howard G. B. Clark &#x27;21 University Professor in the Humanities and Founding Chair of the Lewis Center for the Arts. He held the post of Oxford Professor of Poetry from 1999 to 2004 and has also served as president of the Poetry Society (UK) and poetry editor at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==Life and work==
Muldoon was born, the eldest of three children, on a farm in County Armagh outside The Moy, near the boundary with County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. His father worked as a farmer (among other jobs) and his mother was a school mistress. In 2001, Muldoon said of the Moy: It&#x27;s a beautiful part of the world. It&#x27;s still the place that&#x27;s &#x27;burned into the retina&#x27;, and although I haven&#x27;t been back there since I left for university 30 years ago, it&#x27;s the place I consider to be my home. We were a fairly non-political household; my parents were nationalists, of course, but it was not something, as I recall, that was a major area of discussion. But there were patrols; an army presence; movements of troops; and a sectarian divide. And that particular area was a nationalist enclave, while next door was the parish where the Orange Order was founded; we&#x27;d hear the drums on summer evenings. But I think my mother, in particular, may have tried to shelter us from it all. Besides, we didn&#x27;t really socialise a great deal. We were &#x27;blow-ins&#x27; ‚Äì arrivistes ‚Äì new to the area, and didn&#x27;t have a lot of connections. Talking of his home life, he continues: &quot;I&#x27;m astonished to think that, apart from some Catholic Truth Society pamphlets, some books on saints, there were, essentially, no books in the house, except one set, the Junior World Encyclopaedia, which I certainly read again and again. People would say, I suppose, that it might account for my interest in a wide range of arcane bits of information. At some level, I was self-educated.&quot; He was a &#x27;&quot;Troubles poet&quot; from the beginning.

In 1969, Muldoon read English at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, where he met Seamus Heaney and became close to the Belfast Group of poets which included Michael Longley, Ciar√°n Carson, Medbh McGuckian and Frank Ormsby. Muldoon said of the experience, &quot;I think it was fairly significant, certainly to me. It was exciting. But then I was 19, 20 years old, and at university, so everything was exciting, really.&quot; Muldoon was not a strong student at Queen&#x27;s. He recalls: &quot;I had stopped. Really, I should have dropped out. I&#x27;d basically lost interest halfway through. Not because there weren&#x27;t great people teaching me, but I&#x27;d stopped going to lectures, and rather than doing the decent thing, I just hung around&quot;. During his time at Queen&#x27;s, his first collection &quot;New Weather&quot; was published by Faber and Faber. He met his first wife, fellow student Anne-Marie Conway, and they were married after their graduation in 1973. Their marriage broke up in 1977.

For thirteen years (1973‚Äì86), Muldoon worked as an arts producer for the BBC in Belfast. In this time, which saw the most bitter period of the Troubles, he published the collections &quot;Why Brownlee Left&quot; (1980) and &quot;Quoof&quot; (1983). After leaving the BBC, he taught English and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia and at Caius College and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where his students included Lee Hall (&quot;Billy Elliot&quot;) and Giles Foden (&quot;Last King of Scotland&quot;). In 1987, Muldoon emigrated to the United States, where he taught in the creative writing program at Princeton. He was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University for the five-year term 1999‚Äì2004, and is an Honorary Fellow of Hertford College, Oxford.

Muldoon is married to novelist Jean Hanff Korelitz, whom he met at an Arvon writing course. He has two children, Dorothy and Asher, and lives primarily in New York City.

==Poetry and other works==
His poetry is known for his difficult, sly, allusive style, casual use of obscure or archaic words, understated wit, punning, and deft technique in meter and slant rhyme. As Peter Davidson says in &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of books &quot;Muldoon takes some honest-to-God reading. He&#x27;s a riddler, enigmatic, distrustful of appearances, generous in allusion, doubtless a dab hand at crossword puzzles&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; cites him as being &quot;among the few significant poets of our half-century&quot;; &quot;the most significant English-language poet born since the second world war&quot; ‚Äì a talent off the map. (Notably, Seamus Heaney was born in 1939.) Muldoon&#x27;s work is often compared with Heaney, a fellow Northern Irish poet, friend and mentor to Muldoon. 

In 2003, Muldoon won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. He has been awarded fellowships in the Royal Society of Literature and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the 1994 T. S. Eliot Prize; the 1997 Irish Literature Prize for Poetry, and the 2003 Griffin International Prize for Excellence in Poetry. He was also shortlisted for the 2007 Poetry Now Award. Muldoon&#x27;s poems have been collected into four books: &quot;Selected Poems 1968‚Äì1986&quot; (1986), &quot;New Selected Poems: 1968‚Äì1994&quot; (1996), &quot;Poems 1968‚Äì1998&quot; (2001) and &quot;Selected Poems 1968‚Äì2014&quot; (2016). In September 2007, he was hired as poetry editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Most of Muldoon&#x27;s collections contain shorter poems with an inclusion of a long concluding poem. As Muldoon produced more collections, the long poems gradually took up more space in the volume, until in 1990 the poem &quot;Madoc: A Mystery&quot; took over the volume of that name, leaving only seven short poems to appear before it. Muldoon has not since published a poem of comparable length, but a new trend is emerging whereby more than one long poem appears in a volume.

&quot;Madoc: A Mystery&quot;, exploring themes of colonisation, is among Muldoon&#x27;s most difficult works. It includes, as &quot;poetry&quot;, such non-literary constructions as maps and geometric diagrams. In the book &quot;Irish Poetry since 1950&quot;, John Goodby states it is &quot;by common consent, the most complex poem in modern Irish literature [...] ‚Äì a massively ambitious, a historiographical metafiction&quot;. The post-modern poem narrates, in 233 sections (the same number as the number of Native American tribes), an alternative history in which Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey come to America to found a utopian community. The two poets had, in reality, discussed but never undertaken this journey. Muldoon&#x27;s poem is inspired by Southey&#x27;s work &quot;Madoc&quot;, about a legendary Welsh prince of that name. Critics are divided over the poem&#x27;s success. Some are stunned by its scope and many others, such as John Banville, have professed themselves utterly baffled by it ‚Äì feeling it to be wilfully obscure. Muldoon says of it: &quot;I quite enjoy having fun. It&#x27;s part of how it is, and who we are.&quot;

Muldoon has contributed the librettos for four operas by Daron Hagen: &quot;Shining Brow&quot; (1992), &quot;Vera of Las Vegas&quot; (1996), &quot;Bandanna&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Antient Concert&quot; (2005). His interests have not only included librettos, but rock lyrics as well, penning lines for the band The Handsome Family as well as co-writing the title track of Warren Zevon&#x27;s album &quot;My Ride&#x27;s Here&quot;.

<text>Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough, (16 November 1750 ‚Äì 13 December 1818), was an English judge. After serving as a member of parliament and Attorney General, he became Lord Chief Justice.

==Early life==
Law was born at Great Salkeld, in Cumberland, of which place his father, Edmund Law (1703‚Äì1787), afterwards Bishop of Carlisle, was at the time rector. His mother was Mary Christian, daughter of John Christan of Ewanrigg, Cumberland. Educated at the Charterhouse and at Peterhouse, Cambridge, he passed as third wrangler, and was soon afterwards elected to a fellowship at Trinity. In spite of his father&#x27;s strong wish that he should take holy orders, he chose the legal profession, and on quitting the university was entered at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

==Career==
After spending five years as a special pleader under the bar, he was called to the bar in 1780. He chose the northern circuit, and in a very short time obtained a lucrative practice and a high reputation. In 1787 he was appointed principal counsel for Warren Hastings in the celebrated impeachment trial before the House of Lords, and the ability with which he conducted the defence was universally recognised. He was made a King&#x27;s Counsel that year. In 1798, he was made a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

He had begun his political career as a Whig, but, like many others, he saw in the French Revolution a reason for changing sides, and became a supporter of Pitt. On the formation of the Addington ministry in 1801, he was appointed Attorney General and shortly afterwards was returned to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Newtown in the Isle of Wight. He was knighted in the same year. In 1802 he succeeded Lord Kenyon as Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench. On being raised to the bench he was created Baron Ellenborough, of Ellenborough, in the County in Cumberland, taken from the village where his maternal ancestors had long held a small patrimony.

In 1803, he presided over the treason trial of Colonel Edward Despard. In denying the jury&#x27;s motion for clemency (following the character witness of Vice-Admiral Nelson) Lord Ellenborough emphasised the revolutionary nature of Despard&#x27;s purpose. It was, he claimed, not only to rend the new union between Great Britain and Ireland, but also to affect &quot;the forcible reduction to one common level of all the advantages of property, of all civil and political rights whatsoever&quot;.

Later that same year, 1803, he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. In 1803, he introduced a bill to Parliament which went on to become the Malicious Shooting or Stabbing Act 1803 (often referred to as &quot;Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s Act&quot;) which clarified the law on abortion in England and Ireland.

In 1806, on the death of William Pitt the Younger, Lord Ellenborough served as Chancellor of the Exchequer for two weeks &quot;ad interim&quot;. On the formation of Lord Grenville&#x27;s ministry &quot;of all the talents&quot;, Lord Ellenborough declined the offer of the office of Lord Chancellor, but accepted a seat in the cabinet. His doing so while he retained the chief justiceship was much criticised at the time, and, though not without precedent, was open to such obvious objections on constitutional grounds that the experiment was never repeated. As a judge, his decisions displayed profound legal knowledge, and in mercantile law especially were reckoned of high authority. He was harsh and overbearing to counsel, and in the political trials which were so frequent in his time, such as that of Lord Cochrane for Stock Exchange fraud in 1814, showed an unmistakable bias against the accused. In the trial of William Hone for blasphemy in 1817, Ellenborough directed the jury to find a verdict of guilty, and their acquittal of the prisoner is generally said to have hastened his death. 

On the other hand, his humane and enlightened judgment in &quot;R. v. Inhabitants of Eastbourne&quot; that destitute French refugees in England have a fundamental human right to be given sufficient means to enable them to live, has been much praised and frequently followed. In the field of copyright, his judgment in &quot;Cary v Kearsley&quot; that &quot; a man may fairly adopt part of the work of another for the promotion of science...one must not put manacles on science&quot; was extremely influential in developing the doctrine of fair use. He resigned his judicial office in November 1818, and died shortly after.

==Family==
Lord Ellenborough married, on 17 October 1789, Ann Towry (1769‚Äì1843), the daughter of George Phillips Towry of Foliejon Park at Winkfield in Berkshire and his wife, Elizabeth. They had five sons and five daughters who survived infancy:

*Hon. Elizabeth Susan (d. 31 March 1883) married Charles Abbot, 2nd Baron Colchester. They had one son, Reginald
*Hon. Anne (d. 30 May 1852) married Adm. John Colville, 9th Lord Colville. They had no children.
*Hon. Mary Frederica (d. 16 September 1851) married Lt.-Gen. Thomas Dyneley on 10 July 1827. They had no known children.
*Hon. Frederica Selina (d. 16 April 1879) married Capt. Henry James Ramsden, son of Sir John Ramsden, 4th Baronet. They had five sons and four daughters.
*Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough (8 September 1790 ‚Äì 22 December 1871)
*Hon. Charles Ewan (14 June 1792 ‚Äì 13 August 1850)
*Hon. Henry Spencer (10 May 1802 ‚Äì 15 July 1885)
*Hon. William Towry (16 June 1809 ‚Äì 31 October 1886) was married twice. Firstly to Hon. Augusta Champagne Graves, daughter of Thomas Graves, 2nd Baron Graves, on 15 March 1831. Two years after her death he married secondly, Matilda Montgomery, daughter of Sir Conyngham Montgomery, 1st Baronet, on 25 January 1846. He had five sons, one daughter with Augusta and two more sons and a daughter with Matilda.
*Hon. Frances Henrietta (11 February 1812 ‚Äì 2 March 1894) married twice. Firstly, Charles Des Voeux, son of Sir Charles Des Voeux, 2nd Baronet, on 8 March 1832. Charles died a little over a year later, and Frances married secondly Sir Robert Dallas, 2nd Baronet, on 29 September 1841. With Sir Robert, she had at least one daughter.

He was succeeded as second baron by his eldest son, Edward, later the Earl of Ellenborough; another son, Charles, was Recorder of London and Member of Parliament for Cambridge University UK 1835 until his death.

Three of Ellenborough&#x27;s brothers attained some degree of fame. These were John Law (1745‚Äì1810), Bishop of Elphin; Thomas Law (1759‚Äì1834), who settled in the United States in 1793, and married, as his second wife, Eliza Custis, a granddaughter of Martha Washington; and George Henry Law (1761‚Äì1845), Bishop of Chester and of Bath and Wells. The connection of the Law family with the English Church was kept up by George Henry&#x27;s sons, three of whom took orders. Two of these were Henry Law (1797‚Äì1884), Dean of Gloucester, and James Thomas Law (1790‚Äì1876), chancellor of the Diocese of Lichfield.

<text>Laiuse (, ) is a small borough (&quot;&quot;) in Estonia. It is located in J√µgeva County and is a part of J√µgeva Parish. As of the 2011 census, the settlement&#x27;s population was 371.

Laiuse Middle School is one of the oldest in Estonia, being established in 1822. 

==History==
During the Livonian War, in 1569, the Laiuse Castle was besieged twice by the Livonian Order under Gotthard Kettler. After the war, from 1582 Laiuse, in Polish known as Lajs, was part of Poland. It was the seat of northernmost starostwo in the history of Poland. King Stephen B√°thory appointed Andrzej Orzechowski the starost of Lajs as a reward for his bravery in the Livonian War, and in 1589 King Sigismund III Vasa confirmed the appointment. Andrzej Orzechowski rebuilt the castle following the war, which then served as the seat of the starosts. The population of Lajs exceeded 200. At the start of the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War of 1600‚Äì1611, in 1600, the castle was besieged and captured by Sweden, but was restored to Poland the following year. In 1622, the settlement passed to Sweden, although Poland still appointed starosts of Lajs until the loss of the area was confirmed in 1660. In 1700, the castle served as the main winter quarters of King Charles XII of Sweden. Later it passed to Russia, before it became part of independent Estonia in 1918.

==Laiuse Church==
Laiuse is the location of the medieval Laiuse Church. The church was first mentioned in 1319. In the church yard, there&#x27;s an old lime tree, which was supposedly planted there by king Charles XII of Sweden during his visit in 1701.

<doc id="314480" wikidata="Q1319971" url="?curid=314480" title="Pornography addiction">
<text>Pornography addiction is the scientifically controversial application of an addiction model to the use of pornography. Pornography use may be part of compulsive behavior, with negative consequences to one&#x27;s physical, mental, social, or financial well-being. While the World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-11 (2022) has recognized compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (CSBD) as an &quot;impulsive control disorder&quot;, CSBD is not an addiction, and the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s DSM-5 (2013) and the DSM-5-TR (2022) do not classify compulsive pornography consumption as a mental disorder or a behavioral addiction.

Problematic Internet pornography viewing is the viewing of Internet pornography that is problematic for an individual due to personal or social reasons, including the excessive time spent viewing pornography instead of interacting with others and the facilitation of procrastination. Individuals may report depression, social isolation, career loss, decreased productivity, or financial consequences as a result of their excessive Internet pornography viewing impeding their social lives.

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
Universally accepted diagnostic criteria for pornography addiction or problematic pornography viewing do not exist. Pornography addiction is often defined operationally by the frequency of pornography viewing and negative consequences. The only diagnostic criteria for a behavioral addiction in the current &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; are for pathological gambling, and they are similar to those for substance abuse and dependence, such as preoccupation with the behavior, diminished ability to control the behavior, tolerance, withdrawal, and adverse psychosocial consequences. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed for other behavioral addictions, and these are usually also based on established diagnoses for substance abuse and dependence.

A proposed diagnosis for hypersexual disorder includes pornography as a subtype of this disorder. It includes criteria such as time consumed by sexual activity interfering with obligations, repetitive engagement in sexual activity in response to stress, repeated failed attempts to reduce these behaviors, and distress or impairment of life functioning.

According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, some psychological and behavioral changes characteristic of addiction brain changes include addictive cravings, impulsiveness, weakened executive function, desensitization, and dysphoria. BOLD fMRI results have shown that individuals diagnosed with compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) show enhanced cue reactivity in brain regions associated traditionally with drug-cue reactivity. These regions include the amygdala and the ventral striatum. Men without CSB who had a long history of viewing pornography exhibited a less intense response to pornographic images in the left ventral putamen, possibly suggestive of desensitization.

Neuropsychopharmacological and psychological researches on pornography addiction conducted between 2015 and 2021 have concluded that most studies have been focused entirely or almost exclusively on men in anonymous settings, and the findings are contradictory. Some researchers support the idea that pornography addiction qualifies as a form of behavioral addiction into the umbrella construct of hypersexual behavior and/or a subset of compulsive sexual behavior (CSB), and should be treated as such, whereas others have detected the increased activation of ventral striatal reactivity in men for cues predicting erotic but not monetary rewards and cues signaling erotic pictures, therefore suggesting similarities between pornography addiction and conventional addiction disorders.

Despite the fact that pornography is being spuriously indicted as a public health crisis in the United States and elsewhere, with problematic Internet and online pornography use reported to constitute an increasing burden on public mental health since the 2000s, psychopathological models and diagnostic criteria have lacked consensus, and the body of evidence on the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches is still scarce.

Svedin et. al. found that moderate consumption of pornography is associated with good mental health in boys, while both extremes (too much or too few) yielded worse mental health. Watching deviant (non-mainstream) pornography was associated with worse mental health in boys, but girls were unaffected.

===Diagnostic status===

Pornography addiction is a controversial concept, since it appears to be &quot;largely morally, ideologically, and politically motivated.&quot; Although it is a &quot;nice theory&quot;, empirical support for it is largely missing, and the &quot;industry of porn/sex addiction is based on conservative moral values around sexuality that intrude into clinical practice&quot;. Julie Sale stated &quot;No-one refutes that clients access therapy for help with sexual behaviours that they feel they have no control over. The issue is how these client experiences are conceptualised and how the clinical formulation informs treatment.&quot;

The status of pornography addiction as an addictive disorder, rather than simply a compulsivity, has been hotly contested. Furthermore, research suggests that the use of a pornography addiction label may indicate a socially (as opposed to clinically) driven nosology.

In November 2016, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) issued a position statement on sex/porn addiction which states that AASECT &quot;does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder, and does not find the sexual addiction training and treatment methods and educational pedagogies to be adequately informed by accurate human sexuality knowledge. Therefore, it is the position of AASECT that linking problems related to sexual urges, thoughts or behaviors to a porn/sexual addiction process cannot be advanced by AASECT as a standard of practice for sexuality education delivery, counseling or therapy.&quot;

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5) includes a new section for behavioral addictions, but includes only one disorder: pathological gambling. One other behavioral addiction, internet gaming disorder, appears in the conditions proposed for further study in DSM-5. Psychiatrists cited a lack of research support for refusing to include other behavioral disorders, such as pornography, at the time.

Porn addiction is not a diagnosis in DSM-5 (or any previous version). &quot;Viewing pornography online&quot; is mentioned verbatim in the DSM-5, but it is not considered a mental disorder either.

A number of studies have found neurological markers of addiction in internet porn users, which is consistent with a large body of research finding similar markers in other kinds of problematic internet users. Yet other studies found that critical biomarkers of addiction were missing, and most addiction biomarkers have never been demonstrated for pornography.

The International Classification of Disorders 11 (ICD-11) rejected &quot;pornography addiction&quot;. Specifically, the World Health Organization (WHO) wrote: &quot;Based on the limited current data, it would therefore seem premature to include [problematic Internet use] in ICD-11.&quot;

However, ICD-11 does include the &quot;Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder&quot; (CSBD) in the &quot;impulse control disorders&quot; section. It is defined as &quot;a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour.&quot; David J. Ley argued that that is not an endorsement of the concept of pornography addiction. ICD also specifically excludes anyone from this diagnosis whose distress is due to moral conflict alone, yet moral incongruence is the strongest predictor of believing one is addicted to porn. Note that two studies now contradict this, finding that narcissism, especially antagonist narcissism, predicts identification as a pornography addict.

Introductory psychology textbook authors Coon, Mitterer and Martini, passingly mentioning NoFap, speak of pornography as a &quot;supernormal stimulus&quot; but use the model of compulsion rather than addiction. Addiction and compulsion are models of mental disorders which cancel each other out, the term &quot;addiction&quot; being deprecated, but ICD-11 does not support the existence of &quot;porn addiction&quot;/&quot;sex addiction&quot;.

DSM-5-TR, published in March 2022, does not recognize a diagnosis of sexual addiction/compulsion (which would include internet pornography viewing).

ICD-11 has added pornography to CSBD. However, this is categorized as an impulse control disorder, not an addictive disorder. It has been argued that the CSBD diagnosis is not based upon sex research.

Neither DSM-5, nor DSM-5-TR, nor ICD-10, nor ICD-11 recognize sex addiction or porn addiction as a valid diagnosis. Rothman has stated &quot;pornography is not yet clearly established as a risk factor for multiple health outcomes&quot;.

A 2022 book by McKee, Litsou, Byron, and Ingham casts serious doubts upon the model of &quot;porn addiction&quot;, suggesting that sexual shame should be blamed, instead of pornography. They note that much of the research on the effects of pornography often confuses correlation with causation, and that much pornography research has been normative (i.e. moralistic) instead of descriptive.

Even scientists who find a problem with excessive pornography consumption state that moderate pornography consumption is healthy.

==Treatment==
Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been suggested as a possible effective treatment for pornography addiction based on its success with internet addicts, though no clinical trials have been performed to assess effectiveness among pornography addicts as of 2012. Acceptance and commitment therapy has also been shown to be a potentially effective treatment for problematic internet pornography viewing.

===Online pornography===

Some clinicians and support organizations recommend voluntary use of Internet content-control software, internet monitoring, or both, to manage online pornography use. Sex researcher Alvin Cooper and colleagues suggested several reasons for using filters as a therapeutic measure, including curbing accessibility that facilitates problematic behavior and encouraging clients to develop coping and relapse prevention strategies. Cognitive therapist Mary Anne Layden suggested that filters may be useful in maintaining environmental control. Internet behavior researcher David Delmonico stated that, despite their limitations, filters may serve as a &quot;frontline of protection.&quot;

===Medications===

Studies of those with non-paraphilic expressions of hypersexuality have hypothesized that various mood disorders, as defined in the DSM, may occur more frequently in sexually compulsive men.

Compulsive sexual behavior has been treated with antidepressants including SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, Naltrexone (a medication used to inhibit reward mechanisms in opiate or alcohol addictions), other mood-stabilizers, and anti-androgens.

==Epidemiology==
A 2017 study using a representative sample of Australians researched distress about sex video use. It found that of 10,131 women surveyed, 0.5% of women agreed with the statement that they were &quot;addicted&quot; to pornography; 1.2% (of 4,218 who viewed) when limited to women who say they viewed sex films. The comparable figure limiting to men who view sex films was 4.4%. This was without any clinical screening that should eliminate primary disorders (e.g., depression) or religious-based concerns, so these should be considered high-end estimates for potential disorders, if any exist.

Most studies of rates use a convenience sample. One 2000 study of a convenience sample of 9,265 people found that 1% of Internet users have concerns about their Internet use and 17% of users meet criteria for problematic sexual compulsivity, meaning they score above one standard deviation of the mean on the Kalichman Sexual Compulsivity Scale. A survey of 84 college-age males found that 2060% of a sample of college-age males who use pornography found it to be problematic. Research on internet addiction disorder indicates rates may range from 1.5 to 8.2% in Europeans and Americans.

A 2019 study found that the average frequency of use for those self-describing as addicted to porn was about ten times per year. The study found this identification correlated with male gender, higher frequency of use, and belief that pornography was morally wrong (whether for religious or other reasons).

A review paper about pornography consumption notes that sex addiction is correlated with narcissism.

==Society and culture==
===Support groups===
Several support groups exist for people who wish to quit pornography use and/or believe themselves to be addicted to pornography. Twelve-step programs such as Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), Sexaholics Anonymous (SA), Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA), Sexual Recovery Anonymous (SRA), and Sexual Compulsives Anonymous (SCA) are fellowships of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other so they may overcome their common problem and help others recover from addiction or dependency by using the twelve-step program borrowed from Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and other recovery tools.

NoFap is a website and community forum founded in 2011 that serves as a support group for those who wish to give up pornography and masturbation. It serves as a support group for those who wish to avoid the use of pornography, masturbation, and/or sexual intercourse. Recent peer-reviewed data highlighted considerable levels of misogyny along with a poor understanding of human sexuality and relationships within this online community. Sociologist Kelsy Burke, author of &quot;The Pornography Wars&quot;, believes that this misogyny arises from blaming the female-dominated profession of pornography for men&#x27;s personal problems. &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; and &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; linked NoFap to recent gender-based murders and breeding domestic terrorism.

Fight the New Drug, a Salt Lake City-based non-profit organization founded by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a non-legislative organization which claims to seek to inform and educate individuals regarding pornography usage with science and personal stories. It is aimed at the youth demographic. There is also a PornFree reddit group which focuses on giving up porn rather than masturbation.

Celebrate Recovery is a Christian inter-denominational twelve-step program with about 35,000 available groups and is open to any person who is struggling with life&#x27;s bad habits, hurts, and hang-ups. Celebrate Recovery was started in 1991 at Saddleback Church in California, and their program is based on the Beatitudes from the biblical Sermon on the Plain and the twelve-step program from Alcoholics Anonymous.

===Religious and political factors===

According to professor , a sexologist working for the Academic Medical Center, it is usually the American religious right which claims the existence of pornography addiction and such claims are rare (scarce) among sexologists. A 2018 meta-analysis showed a correlation between a person being religious and perceiving themself as having a pornography addiction, possibly due to people using pornography despite their religion prohibiting it.

According to &quot;Addicted to Lust: Pornography in the Lives of Conservative Protestants&quot; (2019) written by Samuel L. Perry, professor of sociology at the University of Oklahoma, conservative Protestants in the United States are characterized by a &quot;sexual exceptionalism&quot; related to their consumption of pornography due to certain pervasive beliefs within the Conservative Protestant subculture, which entails cognitive dissonance associated with the unfounded conviction to be addicted to pornography, psychological distress, and intense feelings of guilt, shame, self-loathing, depression, and sometimes withdrawal from faith altogether.

Perry&#x27;s book received widespread media coverage and his findings were criticized by Lyman Stone of the Evangelical magazine &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, which asserted that both the quantitative and qualitative statistical data collected by Perry demonstrate that the consumption of pornography in the United States is significantly lower among church-attending Protestant Christians compared to other religious groups, and declared that &quot;Protestant men today who attend church regularly are basically the only men in America still resisting the cultural norm of regularized pornography use&quot;.

The overwhelming majority of all websites and YouTube channels devoted to anti-masturbation and anti-porn addiction propaganda, channels and websites supporting NoFap included, are, according to various sources, owned by far-right Christian fundamentalists and conservative biblical inerrantists, and also are entirely political in nature. Various psychologists, medical doctors, and social scientists have contended that traditional Christian concerns over combating sexual thoughts, desires, and activities, including masturbation, can be seen as unhealthy and unwholesome. This may also apply to secular advocacy of anti-pornography and anti-masturbation, including 16 U.S. states&#x27; legislatures which have declared that pornography is a &quot;public health crisis&quot;.

The American Psychiatric Association had by then already dismissed such moral panic (&quot;political stunt&quot;) in DSM-5 (published in 2013), and DSM-5-TR, published in March 2022, does not recognize a diagnosis of sexual addiction (which would include internet pornography viewing).

Emily F. Rothman, Professor of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health, stated in 2021 that &quot;the professional public health community is not behind the recent push to declare pornography a public health crisis&quot;. The ideas supporting the &quot;crisis&quot; have been described as pseudoscientific.

In many cases, sexual addiction therapy applied to gay men is akin to conversion therapy.

===Mainstream media===
In 2013, American actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed, and starred in the comedy-drama film &quot;Don Jon&quot;, in which the protagonist is addicted to pornography. In an interview to promote the film, Gordon-Levitt discussed what he referred to as the &quot;fundamental difference between a human being and an image on a screen&quot;.

In 2014, American actor Terry Crews talked about his long-standing pornography addiction, which he said had seriously affected his marriage and life and which he was able to overcome only after entering rehab in 2009. He now takes an active role in speaking out about pornography addiction and its impact.

In 2015, English comedian Russell Brand appeared in videos by American anti-pornography group Fight the New Drug, in which he discussed pornography and its harmful effects.

In 2016, American comedian Chris Rock and his wife, Malaak Compton, divorced after 20 years of marriage, which Rock attributed to his infidelity and pornography addiction. He later discussed the details of his pornography addiction in his 2018 stand-up comedy special &quot;Tamborine&quot;.

<doc id="314482" wikidata="Q1564225" url="?curid=314482" title="Soviet submarine S-13">
<text>S-13 was an S-class submarine of the Soviet Navy. Her keel was laid down by Krasnoye Sormovo in Gorky on 19 October 1938. She was launched on 25 April 1939 and commissioned on 31 July 1941 in the Baltic Fleet, under the command of Captain . The submarine is best known for the 1945 sinking of &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, a German military transport ship/converted cruise ship. With a career total of 44,701 GRT (gross register tonnage) sunk or damaged, she is the highest-scoring Soviet submarine in history.

== Service history ==
In the first half of September 1942, under Malanchenko&#x27;s command, &quot;S-13&quot; sank two Finnish ships, &quot;Hera&quot; and , and a German ship &quot;Anna W&quot;, totaling 4,042 tons. When S-13 sank the freighter &quot;Hera&quot;, she fired on the ship&#x27;s lifeboat but failed to hit it.

On 15 October 1942, caught on the surface while charging her batteries, &quot;S-13&quot; was attacked by the Finnish submarine chasers &quot;VMV-13&quot; and &quot;VMV-15&quot;. During her crash dive, the submarine hit the bottom, severely damaging her rudder and destroying her steering gear. The following depth charge attack worsened the damage, but &quot;S-13&quot; escaped and made it back to Kronstadt.

During the next three years, Malanchenko was relieved by Alexander Marinesko and &quot;S-13&quot; was repaired and returned to sea.

Under the command of Marinesko, then 32, on 30 January 1945, at Stolpe Bank off the Pomeranian coast, &quot;S-13&quot; sank the 25,484-ton German armed transport ship under Kriegsmarine ensign, overfilled with civilians and military personnel, with three torpedoes. Recent calculations estimate more than 9,000 people were killed, the worst loss of life in maritime history.

On 10 February 1945, &quot;S-13&quot; sank another German military transport ship . 3,300 civilians and military personnel from the ship died, and 300 survived.

Marinesko was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1990.

&quot;S-13&quot; was decommissioned on 7 September 1954 and stricken on 17 December 1956.
&quot;S-13&quot; also shelled and damaged the German fishing vessel, &quot;Siegfried&quot; (563 GRT), which was damaged but escaped.

<text>Ishmael Scott Reed (born February 22, 1938) is an American poet, novelist, essayist, songwriter, composer, playwright, editor and publisher known for his satirical works challenging American political culture. Perhaps his best-known work is &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot; (1972), a sprawling and unorthodox novel set in 1920s New York.

Reed&#x27;s work has often sought to represent neglected African and African-American perspectives; his energy and advocacy have centered more broadly on neglected peoples and perspectives, irrespective of their cultural origins.

==Life and career==
Reed was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His family moved to Buffalo, New York, when he was a child, during the Great Migration. After attending local schools, Reed attended the University at Buffalo. Reed withdrew from college in his junior year, partly for financial reasons, but mainly because he felt he needed a new atmosphere to support his writing and music. He said of this decision:

This was the best thing that could have happened to me at the time because I was able to continue experimenting along the lines I wanted, influenced by [Nathanael] West and others. I didn&#x27;t want to be a slave to somebody else&#x27;s reading lists. I kind of regret the decision now because I&#x27;ve gotten some of the most racist and horrible things said to me because of this.

In 1995, the college awarded him an honorary doctorate.

Speaking about his influences, Reed has said:

I&#x27;ve probably been more influenced by poets than by novelists‚Äîthe Harlem Renaissance poets, the Beat poets, the American surrealist Ted Joans. Poets have to be more attuned to originality, coming up with lines and associations the ordinary prose writer wouldn&#x27;t think of.

Among writers from the Harlem Renaissance for whose work Reed has expressed admiration are Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, George Schuyler, Bruce Nugent, Countee Cullen, Rudolph Fisher and Arna Bontemps.

In 1962, Reed moved to New York City and co-founded with Walter Bowart the &quot;East Village Other,&quot; which became a well-known underground publication. Reed was also a member of the Umbra Writers Workshop (he attended his first Umbra meeting in Spring 1963, with others present including Lorenzo Thomas, Askia Tour√©, Charles Patterson, David Henderson, Albert Haynes, and Calvin Hernton), some of whose members helped establish the Black Arts Movement and promoted a Black Aesthetic. Although Reed never participated in that movement, he has continued to research the history of black Americans. While working on his novel &quot;Flight to Canada&quot; (1976), he coined the term &quot;Neo-Slave narrative&quot;, which he used in 1984 in &quot;A Conversation with Ishmael Reed&quot; by Reginald Martin. During this time, Reed also made connections with musicians and poets such as Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, and Albert Ayler, which contributed to Reed&#x27;s vast experimentation with jazz and his love for music.

In 1970, Reed moved to the West Coast to begin teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught for 35 years. Retired from there in 2005, he is serving as a Distinguished Professor at California College of the Arts. He lives in Oakland, California, with his wife of more than 50 years, Carla Blank, a noted author, choreographer, and director.

Reed&#x27;s archives are held by the Special Collections at the University of Delaware in Newark. &quot;Ishmael Reed: An Exhibition&quot;, curated by Timothy D. Murray, was shown at the University of Delaware Library from August 16 to December 16, 2007.

== Personal life ==
Reed said in a 2022 interview for &quot;World Literature Today&quot;: &quot;I come from a family of Tennessee fighters. Like my mother, who was abandoned and had to make do with her skills. She organized two strikes. One of the strikes was of the maids at a hotel in Buffalo. The other was at a department store, where the Black women were assigned to do stock work and the white women were salespersons. She became the first Black salesperson as a result of the strike. She wrote a book I deeply admire called Black Girl from Tannery Flats. But when she died, her achievement was that she became a salesperson. She was a fighter.&quot;

In 1960, Reed married Priscilla Thompson. Their daughter, Timothy (1960‚Äì2021), was born the same year. Timothy dedicated her semi-autobiographical book &quot;Showing Out&quot; (Thunder&#x27;s Mouth Press, 2003) to her father.

Reed and Thompson divorced in 1970. Since 1970, he has been married to writer and teacher Carla Blank. Their daughter, Tennessee, is also an author.

==Published works==
Reed&#x27;s published works include 12 novels, beginning in 1967 with &quot;The Freelance Pallbearers&quot;, followed by &quot;Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down&quot; (1969), &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot; (1972), &quot;The Last Days of Louisiana Red&quot; (1974), &quot;Flight to Canada&quot; (1976), &quot;The Terrible Twos&quot; (1982), &quot;Reckless Eyeballing&quot; (1986), &quot;The Terrible Threes&quot; (1989), &quot;Japanese by Spring&quot; (1993), &quot;Juice!&quot; (2011), &quot;Conjugating Hindi&quot; (2018), and most recently &quot;The Terrible Fours&quot;, third in his &quot;Terribles&quot; series and published by Baraka Books of Montreal in June 2021. To commemorate its 50 years in print, in 2022, Scribner&#x27;s released a new edition of his third novel, &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot;, cited by Harold Bloom as one of 500 great books of the Western canon. It includes a new introduction by Reed.

Among Reed&#x27;s other books are seven collections of poetry, including &quot;Why the Black Hole Sings the Blues: Poems 2006‚Äì2019&quot;, released by Dalkey Archive Press in November 2020; 11 collections of essays, with the most recent, &quot;Why No Confederate Statues in Mexico,&quot; released by Baraka Books in September 2019; one farce, &quot;Cab Calloway Stands In for the Moon or The Hexorcism of Noxon D Awful&quot; (1970); two librettos, &quot;Gethsemane Park&quot; and in collaboration with Colleen McElroy &quot;The Wild Gardens of the Loop Garoo&quot;; a sampler collection, &quot;The Reed Reader&quot; (2000); two travelogues, of which the most recent is &quot;Blues City: A Walk in Oakland&quot; (2003); and six plays, collected by Dalkey Archive Press as &quot;Ishmael Reed, The Plays&quot; (2009). His seventh play, &quot;The Final Version,&quot; premiered at New York City&#x27;s Nuyorican Poets Caf√© in December 2013; his eighth, &quot;Life Among the Aryans&quot; (&quot;a satire that chronicles the misadventures of two hapless revolutionaries&quot;), had a staged reading in 2017 at the Nuyorican Poets Caf√© and a full production in 2018. Reed&#x27;s ninth play, &quot;The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda,&quot; premiered on May 23, 2019, at the Nuyorican Poets Caf√©. Archway Editions, an imprint of powerHouse Cultural Entertainment, published the script in October 2020. His tenth play, &quot;The Slave Who Loved Caviar&quot;, received a virtual reading premiere in March 2021, and a full production premiered at the Off-Broadway venue Theater for the New City on December 23, 2021.&quot;The Conductor&quot; premiered at Theater for the New City on March 9, 2023. His twelfth and newest play, &quot;The Shine Challenge 2024&quot;, premiered as a virtual staged reading February 23 through April 15, 2024, sponsored by the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.

Reed&#x27;s most recent nonfiction works are &quot;Malcolm and Me&quot;, an audiobook narrated by Reed and released by Audible in 2020, and &quot;The Complete Muhammad Ali&quot;, published by Baraka Books of Montreal in 2015. Audible released a new short story by Reed, &quot;The Fool Who Thought Too Much&quot;, in November 2020. In 2022, Audible released Reed&#x27;s new novella, &quot;The Man Who Haunted Himself&quot;.

Reed has also edited 15 anthologies, including the recent &quot;Bigotry on Broadway&quot;, co-edited with his wife, Carla Blank, and published by Baraka Books of Montreal in September 2021. Other anthologies include &quot;Black Hollywood Unchained&quot; (Third World Press, 2015) and &quot;POW WOW, Charting the Fault Lines in the American Experience‚ÄîShort Fiction from Then to Now&quot; (2009), a collection of works by 63 writers, co-edited with Carla Blank, which spans more than 200 years of American writing. In his foreword, Reed calls it &quot;a gathering of voices from the different American tribes&quot;. &quot;POW WOW&quot; is the fiction companion anthology to &quot;From Totems to Hip-Hop: A Multicultural Anthology of Poetry Across the Americas, 1900‚Äì2002&quot; (2003), in which Reed endorses an open definition of American poetry as an amalgamation, which should include work found in the traditional Western canon of European-influenced American poetry as well as work by immigrants, hip-hop artists, and Native Americans.

The 2013 Signet Classic edition of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; features a new afterword by Reed. In 2019, he contributed forewords to &quot;The Collected Novels of Charles Wright&quot;, published by Harper Perennial; Charles Fr√©ger&#x27;s &quot;Cimarron: Freedom and Masquerade&quot; (Thames &amp; Hudson); and Cathy Jackson-Gent&#x27;s &quot;Surviving Financially in a Rigged System&quot; (Third World Press Foundation). Reed&#x27;s Introduction to &quot;The Minister Primarily&quot;, a previously unpublished novel by the late John Oliver Killens, was published by Amistad in July 2021.

Williams&#x27; novel, &quot;The Man Who Cried I Am&quot;, and photographer Awol Erizku&#x27;s &quot;Mystic Parallax&quot;.
==Honors and awards==
Two of Reed&#x27;s books have been nominated for National Book Awards, both in 1973: his poetry collection &quot;Conjure&quot;, and his 1972 novel &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot;. &quot;Conjure&quot; was also nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. His &quot;New and Collected Poems, 1964‚Äì2007&quot;, received the Commonwealth Club of California&#x27;s gold medal. A poem published in Seattle in 1969, &quot;beware : do not read this poem&quot;, has been cited by Gale Research Company as one of approximately 20 poems that teachers and librarians have ranked as the most frequently studied in literature courses. Reed&#x27;s novels, poetry and essays have been translated into French, Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, Hebrew, Hungarian, Dutch, Korean, Chinese and Czech, among other languages.

The University of California at Berkeley honored Reed as their Distinguished Emeritus Awardee of the Year 2020. In June 2018, in Detroit, Reed was honored with the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History Award. On November 20, 2017, Reed received the AUDELCO Pioneer Award for the Theater.

In 1999, he received a Fred Cody Award from the Bay Area Book Reviewers Association, and was inducted into Chicago State University&#x27;s National Literary Hall of Fame of Writers of African Descent.

Area Writing Project&#x27;s 2nd Annual Exemplary Writer&#x27;s Award and the Martin Millennial Writers, Inc. Contribution to Southern Arts Award, in Memphis, Tennessee.

A 1972 manifesto inspired a major visual art exhibit, &quot;NeoHooDoo: Art for a Forgotten Faith,&quot; curated by Franklin Sirmans for the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas, where it opened on June 27, 2008, and subsequently traveled to P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in New York City, and the Miami Art Museum through 2009. Litquake, the annual San Francisco literary festival, honored him with its 2011 Barbary Coast Award. Buffalo, New York, celebrated February 21, 2014, as Ishmael Reed Day, when he received Just Buffalo Literary Center&#x27;s 2014 Literary Legacy Award.

In April 2022, Reed was announced as the recipient of a lifetime achievement Anisfield-Wolf Book Award in recognition of his contributions to literature. In October 2023, Reed received the Hurston/Wright Foundation‚Äôs Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Collaborations and influences==
Honoring his experience of first achieving national publication of his poetry in anthologies edited by the senior writers Langston Hughes and Walter Lowenfels, as a result of his introducing Lucille Clifton&#x27;s poetry to Langston Hughes, Reed was responsible for her first national recognition in Hughes&#x27; anthology &quot;The Poetry of the Negro&quot; (1967).

Reed has continued to champion the work of other contemporary writers, by founding and serving as editor and publisher of various small presses and journals since the early 1970s. These include &quot;Yardbird Reader&quot; (which he edited from 1972 to 1976), and Reed, Cannon and Johnson Communications, an independent publishing house begun with Steve Cannon and Joe Johnson that focused on multicultural literature in the 1970s. Reed&#x27;s current publishing imprint is Ishmael Reed Publishing Company, and his online literary publication, Konch Magazine, features an international mix of poetry, essays and fiction.

Among the writers first published by Reed when they were students in his writing workshops are Terry McMillan, Mona Simpson, Mitch Berman, Kathryn Trueblood, Danny Romero, Fae Myenne Ng, Brynn Saito, Mandy Kahn, and John Keene.

Reed is one of the producers of &quot;The Domestic Crusaders&quot;, a two-act play about Muslim Pakistani Americans written by his former student, Wajahat Ali. Its first act was performed at the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Millennium Hall in Washington, D.C., on November 14, 2010, and remains archived on their website.

Critics have also pointed to Reed&#x27;s influence on writers Percival Everett, Colson Whitehead, Victor LaValle and Paul Beatty. In Chris Jackson&#x27;s interview of Reed in the Fall 2016 edition of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, Reed discusses many literary influences, including Dante, the Celtic Revival poets, James Baldwin, George Schuyler, Nathanael West, Bob Kaufman, and Charles Wright. Reed said in a 2011 interview with Parul Sehgal: &quot;My work holds up the mirror to hypocrisy, which puts me in a tradition of American writing that reaches back to Nathaniel Hawthorne.&quot; Reed has also been quoted as saying: &quot;So this is what we want: to sabotage history. They won&#x27;t know whether we&#x27;re serious or whether we are writing fiction ... Always keep them guessing.&quot;

When discussing influences on his writing style in &quot;Writin‚Äô is Fightin‚Äô&quot; he attributed much of it to the warrior tradition he feels is inherent in African and African-American culture. Similar contemporary authors that Reed insists deny victim literature with a centralized black male villain are Amiri Baraka and Ed Bullins.

Looking forward in his writing Reed has stated that he wants to sustain Western values but mix them up a little bit to express a sense of multi-culturalism that represents more than just the African-American voice. Published in 1993 the novel&quot;, Japanese by Spring&quot;, was Reed&#x27;s first trilingual text. The novel used English, Japanese, and Yoruba to better represent his ideas of a more realistic American multi-culturalism.

&quot;Conjugating Hindi&quot; was deeply compelled by his ideas of depicting a unification of multiple cultures. In this novel Reed explores the congruencies and differences of African-American and South Asian American cultures though political discourse posed by white neo-conservative Americans toward both ethnicities. As described in the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot;, &quot;it is brilliant ‚Äî the same sort of experimental brilliance observable in the fiction of Thomas Pynchon or the cut-up technique of William S. Burroughs ‚Äî and more accessible. ...&quot;Conjugating Hindi&quot; is a firebrand‚Äôs novel, the crackling, overflowing, pugnacious novel of someone who doesn&#x27;t care about genre boundaries any more than he cares about historical boundaries, but who does care deeply about innovating.&quot;

==Music==
Ishmael Reed&#x27;s texts and lyrics have been performed, composed or set to music by Albert Ayler, David Murray, Allen Toussaint, Carman Moore, Taj Mahal, Olu Dara, Lester Bowie, Carla Bley, Steve Swallow, Ravi Coltrane, Leo Nocentelli, Eddie Harris, Anthony Cox, Don Pullen, Billy Bang, Bobby Womack, Milton Cardona, Omar Sosa, Fernando Saunders, Yosvanni Terry, Jack Bruce, Little Jimmy Scott, Robert Jason, Alvin Youngblood Hart, Mary Wilson of the Supremes, Cassandra Wilson, Gregory Porter and others.

Reed has been the central participant in the longest ongoing music/poetry collaboration, known as Conjure projects, produced by Kip Hanrahan on American Clav√©: &quot;Conjure I&quot; (1984) and &quot;Conjure II&quot; (1988), which were reissued by Rounder Records in 1995; and &quot;Conjure Bad Mouth&quot; (2005), whose compositions were developed in live Conjure band performances, from 2003 to 2004, including engagements at Paris&#x27;s Banlieues Bleues, London&#x27;s Barbican Centre, and the Blue Note Caf√© in Tokyo. The &quot;Village Voice&quot; ranked the 2005 &quot;Conjure&quot; CD one of four best spoken-word albums released in 2006.

In 2007, Reed made his debut as a jazz pianist and bandleader with &quot;For All We Know&quot; by The Ishmael Reed Quintet. His piano playing was cited by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; as he accompanied a 2019 fashion show at the Serpentine Gallery in London, featuring the work of designer Grace Wales Bonner. In 2008, he was honored as Blues Songwriter of the Year from the West Coast Blues Hall of Fame Awards. A David Murray CD released in 2009, &quot;The Devil Tried to Kill Me&quot;, includes two songs with lyrics by Reed: &quot;Afrika&quot;, sung by Taj Mahal, and the title song performed by SF-based rapper Sista Kee. On September 11, 2011, in a Jazz √† la Villette concert at the Grande Halle in Paris, the Red Bull Music Academy World Tour premiered three new songs with lyrics by Ishmael Reed, performed by Macy Gray, Tony Allen, members of The Roots, David Murray and his Big Band, Amp Fiddler and &quot;Fela!&quot; singer/dancers. In 2013, David Murray, with vocalists Macy Gray and Gregory Porter, released the CD &quot;Be My Monster Love&quot;, with three new songs with lyrics by Reed: &quot;Army of the Faithful&quot;, &quot;Hope is a Thing With Feathers,&quot; and the title track, &quot;Be My Monster Love.&quot; In 2022, Reed released his first album of original compositions, &quot;The Hands Of Grace&quot;. In 2023, Konch Records released &quot;Blues Lyrics by Ishmael Reed&quot; with Reed reading his poetry with the East Coast Blues Caravan of All Stars featuring Ronnie Stewart, and guest artist David Murray.

==Before Columbus Foundation==
Ishmael Reed is the founder of the Before Columbus Foundation, which since 1980 has annually presented the American Book Awards and the Oakland chapter of PEN, known as the &quot;blue-collar PEN&quot;, which also gives annual awards to writers.
