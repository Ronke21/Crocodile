<text>The Ford Galaxie is a car that was marketed by Ford in North America from the 1959 to 1974 model years. Deriving its nameplate from a marketing tie-in with the excitement surrounding the Space Race, the Galaxie was offered as a sedan within the full-size Ford range throughout its production run. In the full-size segment, the model line competed against the Chevrolet Impala and Dodge Polara (the latter, also receiving a nameplate inspired by the Space Race). 

The model line was assembled by Ford in multiple sites across the United States; four generations of the model line were produced. The Galaxie was also produced locally by Ford Australia and Ford Brasil, adopting commonality from the third-generation 1965 design. 


== Nameplate usage ==
In 1958, a concept car was introduced called &quot;la Galaxie&quot; which incorporated the headlights into pods inline with the grille and a reduced front profile.

For 1962, all full-size Fords wore the Galaxie badge (replacing the Fairlane entirely), as higher-trim series took on Galaxie 500 and Galaxie 500XL badging. For 1965, the higher-content Galaxie 500 LTD was introduced as a flagship model. For 1966, the nomenclature was revised slightly. Alongside the introduction of the higher-performance Galaxie 500 7-Litre, the Galaxie 500 LTD became the Ford LTD, with the Galaxie now becoming the mid-level full-size series (above the Ford Custom/Custom 500). For 1967, the 500 7-Litre was phased into the Ford XL; along with the LTD, the Ford XL was slotted above the standard Galaxie/Galaxie 500.

The Galaxie remained slotted as the mid-range full-size Ford into the 1970s between the Custom and the LTD (the XL was discontinued after 1970). After the 1974 model year, Ford dropped both the Galaxie and the Custom in favor of consolidating its full-size sedan line to the LTD (the Custom 500 remained in production for fleet sales).

==1959==
The 1959 Ford range was introduced in late 1958 with the Fairlane 500 as the top trim level. During the 1959 model year, the Galaxie was added to the range as an additional trim level, assuming the top position from the Fairlane 500. The Galaxie was offered with the same sedan and hardtop body styles as the Fairlane 500 whilst the Sunliner and Skyliner convertibles were moved across from the Fairlane 500 range. Styling varied from the Fairlane 500 with the addition of a Ford Thunderbird-style C pillar on all but the Sunliner. Although a separate series from the Fairlane 500, 1959 Galaxie models carried both &quot;Fairlane 500&quot; and &quot;Galaxie&quot; badging.

In keeping with the era, the 1959 Galaxie was a chrome and stainless steel-bedecked vehicle with optional two-tone paint. It was the very image of the ostentatious late-1950s American automobiles, though somewhat tamer than its Chevrolet and Plymouth competitors. Ford advertised &quot;safety anchorage&quot; for the front seats. The parking brake was now a pedal. Seat belts, a padded dashboard, and child-proof rear door locks were optional, while a deep-dished steering wheel and double-door locks were standard.

Among the models was the Skyliner, moved up-market from the Fairlane 500 and featuring a retractable hardtop that folded down into the trunk space. This feature was complicated and expensive, and left very little trunk room when folded down. Power retractable hardtops have since been used by luxury manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, and Cadillac, but in all these cases the vehicle was a two-seater, allowing a much smaller top mechanism than the Skyliner&#x27;s. Not until 2006, when the Pontiac G6 convertible, Peugeot 206 CC (in Europe) and Volkswagen Eos appeared, did another mass-market model with a rear seat appear in this category.

A fixture also was the previous year&#x27;s 352 V8, still developing .
==1960–1964==


;1960

The 1960 Galaxie introduced all-new design with less ornamentation. A new body style was the &quot;Starliner&quot;, featuring a huge, curving rear observation window on a pillarless, hardtop bodyshell. The thin, sloping rear roof pillar featured three &quot;star&quot; emblems that served as the Galaxie signature badge for all 1960 - 62 models. The formal roofed 2-door hardtop was not available this year, but the roofline was used for the Galaxie 2-door pillared sedan, complete with chromed window frames. It had been the most popular body style in the line for 1959, and sales dropped off sharply. Contrary to Ford&#x27;s tradition of pie-plate round taillights, the 1960 featured &quot;half-moon&quot; lenses turned downward. The &quot;A&quot; pillar now swept backward instead of forward, making entering and exiting the car more convenient.
;1961

For 1961, the bodywork was redone again, although the underpinnings were the same as for 1960. This time, the tailfins were almost gone; the small blade-like fins capped smaller versions of 1959&#x27;s &quot;pie-plate&quot; round taillamps once again. Performance was beginning to be a selling point, and the 1961 Galaxie offered a new 390 CID (6.4 L) version of Ford&#x27;s FE series pushrod V8, which was available with either a four-barrel carburetor or, for higher performance, three two-barrel carburetors. The latter was rated at 401 hp (298 kW) (gross). The 352 was downgraded in favor of the 390; it was equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor and single exhaust. The Starliner was again offered this year, and Ford promoted this model with luxury and power equipment, but it was dropped at the end of the year, as the re-introduced square-roof hardtop coupe, the Galaxie Club Victoria, took the bulk of sales.

;1962
For 1962, the Galaxie name was applied to all of Ford&#x27;s full size models, as the Fairlane name was moved to a new intermediate model and Custom was temporarily retired. New top-line Galaxie 500 (two-door sedan and hardtop, four-door sedan and hardtop, and &quot;Sunliner&quot; convertible) models offered plusher interiors, more chrome trim outside, and a few additional luxury items over and above what was standard on the plainer Galaxie models. Base Galaxie models were available in two- and four-door sedans as well as the plain Ranch Wagon. In an effort to stimulate midseason sales, Ford introduced a group of sporty cars along with a &quot;Lively Ones&quot; marketing campaign. These models featured the bucket seats and console that were popularized by the Chevrolet Corvair Monza, and included a Fairlane 500 Sports Coupe, and a Falcon Futura. The full-size line was available with new bucket-seats-and-console &quot;Lively One,&quot; the Galaxie 500/XL (two-door hardtop and convertible). Ford stated in its sales literature that XL stood for &quot;Xtra Lively.&quot;

The &quot;Mileage Maker&quot; 6-cylinder was the base engine. The V8 was standard on the 500/XL. The XL had sportier trim inside and out. This model was Ford&#x27;s response to Chevrolet&#x27;s Super Sport option for the big Impala, which was introduced the previous year and saw a significant rise in sales for 1962. A engine was available in single four-barrel or triple-carbureted &quot;six-barrel&quot; form. Tailfins were gone, giving the 1962 models a more rounded, softer rear end look. Taillights were set lower into the rear panel and were partially sunken into the newly sculpted rear bumper. Outside, XL models got a thicker body side chrome spear, along with a new &quot;Galaxie 500XL&quot; emblem on each rear fender (including the convertible, where this badge replaced the &quot;Sunliner&quot; script). An oval version of the Galaxie &quot;star&quot; emblem replaced Ford crests on the roof sail panels on hardtops. Front fenders shapes were the same as 1961; a slightly modified flat-face grille featured a large &quot;star&quot;emblem in its center for all 500 and higher-priced Galaxie models.

The 1962 models were overweight by comparison to the Super Duty Pontiacs with their aluminum body panels and larger-displacement engines. Therefore, late in the production run, Ford&#x27;s Experimental Garage was ordered to reduce the weight of the Galaxie. It produced 11 &quot;lightweight Galaxies&quot;, making use of fiberglass panels, as well as aluminum bumpers, fender aprons, and brackets; the result was a Galaxie weighing in at under . The base 2-door Club Sedan was . It was an improvement.

;1963

The 1963 model was essentially unchanged save for some freshening and added trim; windshields were reshaped and a four-door hardtop 500/XL was added. A lower, fastback roofline was added mid-year to improve looks and make the big cars more competitive on the NASCAR tracks with less drag and reduced aerodynamic lift at high speed. This 1963½ model, the industry&#x27;s first official &quot;½ year&quot; model, was called the &quot;sports hardtop&quot; or &quot;fastback&quot; (it shared this feature with the for 1963½ Falcon). Galaxie buyers showed their preference as the new sports hardtop models handily outsold the &quot;boxtop&quot; square-roof models. The sports hardtop was available in both Galaxie 500, and Galaxie 500/XL trim. Mercury also received the new roofline (under the Marauder badge) in Monterey, Montclair, and Park Lane models. This year, a no-frills big Ford, priced around $100.00 below the base Galaxie sedans, was offered, badged as the Ford 300. It was offered for 1963 only, and was replaced by the Custom series in 1964. The &quot;Swing-away&quot; steering wheel became optional.

The Fairlane&#x27;s newly enlarged &quot;Challenger&quot; V8 engine of replaced the Y-block as the entry level V8. Later in the year, the 260 was replaced with an enlarged version displacing 289 cubic inches. At the beginning of the 1963 model run, the 292 Y-block V8 was replaced as the base V8 engine with the Fairlane&#x27;s new small block 260. The 260 proved underpowered for the heavy full size Ford and was replaced midyear (coincident with the introduction of the 63 and 1/2 models) with the 289 V8. The 289 was then the largest of the &quot;small block series&quot; that was first used (221 cubic inch version) in the 1962 Fairlane. The 260 was offered on the Falcon Sprint and later, in mid 1964, in the early version of the 1965 Mustang. By 1965 model introduction (in the fall of 1964), the 260 (which had disappointing performance in all versions including the Sprint and Mustang) was replaced by the 289 in all models. 

Ford continued to offer the FE series 352 in the 1963 full size, as well as 3 versions of the 390 V8 (regular, high performance, and police). Five different transmissions were offered for 1963. A 3-speed manual column shift was standard on all models except the 406 V8, which required the heavier duty Borg-Warner 4-speed manual. A three speed manual with overdrive was optional, but rarely ordered. The two-speed Ford-O-Matic was common with the 6-cylinder and small block V-8s, while the majority of big blocks (352 and 390) were ordered with the 3-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission. The availability of several different rear end ratios, along with 5 transmissions, and 8 different engines, led to a huge number of different driveline combinations for 1963. The most produced combination for the Galaxie and Galaxie 500 was the 352 V8, with Cruise-O-Matic and the 3.0 rear end ratio. Ford&#x27;s &quot;Club,&quot; &quot;Town,&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot; monikers for body styles were retired in 1963, replaced by generic labels, &quot;2-door&quot;,&quot;4-door&quot;, and &quot;Hardtop.&quot;

Partway through this year and in limited quantities, a new 427 replaced the 406 for racing applications. It was intended to meet NHRA and NASCAR 7-liter maximum engine size rules. This engine was rated at a (gross horsepower) with 2 x 4 barrel Holley carburetors and a solid lifter camshaft. Ford also made available aluminum cylinder heads as a dealer option.

The 1963½ was still overweight, however. To be competitive in drag racing Ford produced 212 (around 170 from Ford Norfolk, about 20 from Ford Los Angeles) lightweight versions of the &quot;R&quot; code 427, in the Galaxie 500 Sport Special Tudor Fastback. Available only in Corinthian White with red vinyl interior, and with a list price of about US$4,200 (when a base Ford 300 went for US$2,324, and XL Fastback was US$3,268), these cars came stock with Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed, 4.11:1 rear axle, heavy-duty suspension and brakes, and were fitted with a fiberglass hood (a flat piece at first, late in 1963 the popular blister hood also used on the Thunderbolt), trunk, front fenders, and fender aprons, as well as aluminum bumpers and mounting brackets, transmission cases, and bellhousing. Hood springs, heater, trunk lining and mat, spare wheel and tire (and mounting bracket), trunk lid torsion bar, jack, lug wrench, one horn (of the stock two), armrests, rear ashtrays, courtesy lights, and dome light were removed to reduce weight. The first 20 cars had functional fiberglass doors, which shaved ; these were deleted because of Ford&#x27;s concern for safety if used on the highway. The cars had all sound-deadening material removed, lightweight seats and floormats, and no options. They were not factory equipped with cold-air induction, as the Thunderbolt would be. In addition, they were built on the -lighter Ford 300 chassis, originally intended for a smaller-displacement V8. In all, the 427s were lighter than before ( with the fiberglass doors).

The first two lightweight Galaxies, using bodies, were assembled at Wayne, Michigan, late in January 1963, to be tested at the 1963 Winternats. They were delivered to Tasca Ford (East Providence, Rhode Island) and Bob Ford (Dearborn, Michigan). Bill Lawton&#x27;s Tasca Galaxie turned the best performance, with a 12.50 pass at . It was not enough against the 1963 Chevrolet Impala Z-11s in Limited Production/Stock, however. 

Three more were assembled from parts and tested at Ford&#x27;s Experimental Garage in Dearborn. One of the next two, the last Winternationals test cars, was prepared by Bill Stroppe in Long Beach, California, for Les Ritchey; it was featured in the July 1963 issue of &quot;Hot Rod&quot;. For all their efforts, Ford discovered the Galaxies were still too heavy, and the project was abandoned. Some of these cars competed in England, Australia and South Africa after being modified by Holman and Moody who fitted them with disc brakes and other circuit racing components. Jack Sears won the 1963 British Saloon Car Championship driving Galaxies and Cortinas and the racing Galaxies were also driven by Sir Jack Brabham, Graham Hill and other notable drivers of the period. The heavy Galaxies suffered from persistent brake failure that led to a number of crashes, and in late 1963 started using the 12-inch disc brakes from the Ford GT40 program. By this time the Lotus Cortinas were being developed and the big Galaxie became uncompetitive.

;1964

Model year 1964 was the fourth and final year of this body style. Interior trim was altered, and the exterior featured a more sculpted look which was actually designed to make the car more aerodynamic for NASCAR. The formal-roof &quot;boxtop&quot; style was no longer available, all non-wagon models now featuring the &quot;fastback&quot; roof design that was the runaway best-seller in 1963. The base 300 was replaced by a line of Custom and Custom 500 models. The 289 continued as the base V8 and was standard in the XL series. XL models got new thin-shell bucket seats with chrome trim. Federal regulations now required lap-style safety belts for both front outboard occupants. The ignition switch was moved from the left side of the steering column, to the right, but otherwise the attractive instrument panel remained unchanged from &#x27;63. The 1964 XL two-door hardtop became the best seller of any XL produced in any year.

The engine was used in 50 lightweight fiberglass-equipped cars for drag racing. These competed in North America but were still too heavy and Ford introduced the lightweight Fairlane Thunderbolt.

The Ford Country Squire station wagon, while wearing &quot;Country Squire&quot; badging, was actually part of the Galaxie 500 line. Some Country Squires had &quot;Galaxie 500&quot; badging on the glovebox indicating the series name. These station wagons featured the same trims as Galaxie 500s, and were a step up from the base-model Country Sedan.

==1965–1968==

The 1965 Galaxie was an all-new design, featuring vertically stacked dual headlights. The cars were taller and bulkier than the previous year&#x27;s. The new top-of-the-line designation was the &quot;Galaxie 500 LTD&quot; and &quot;Galaxie 500 XL&quot;. The LTD and the XL trim package were accessory upgrades from the base Galaxie model. Engine choices were the same as 1964, except for an all-new six-cylinder engine replacing the 1950s-era 223 &quot;Mileage-Maker&quot; six and the 352 was now equipped with dual exhausts and a four-barrel carburetor.

Suspension on the 1965 models was redesigned. Replacing the former leaf-spring rear suspension was a new three-link system, with coil springs. Interiors featured a new instrument panel, as well as two-way key vehicle access: the introduction of two keys was for valet parking, where the rounded head key would only open the trunk or locked glove compartment, while the squared-head key would only unlock the doors and the ignition.

The 1966 model had a slight &quot;Coke Bottle&quot; design and new horizontally split grille among other small changes.

A new model was introduced for 1966; the &quot;Galaxie 500 7 Litre&quot;, fitted with a new engine, the 345 hp Thunderbird V8. This engine was also available on the Ford Thunderbird and the Mercury S-55. The police versions received a 360 hp version of the 428 known as the &#x27;Police Interceptor&#x27; as police cars. Safety regulations for 1966 required seat belts front and rear on all new cars sold domestically. The Galaxie 500 would be the number three-selling convertible in the U.S. in 1966, with 27,454 sold; it was beaten by the Mustang (at 72,119, by nearly 2.5:1) and by the Impala at 38,000. A parking brake light on the dashboard and an AM/FM radio were optional. The 1966 LTD dropped the Galaxie name.

The 1966 body style was introduced in Brazil (Ford do Brasil) as a 1967 model; it used the same platform and body throughout its lifetime until Brazilian production ended in 1983. A vehicle of this model was used by Queen Elizabeth during her visit to Chile in 1968, and has since been preserved by the Chilean government as a ceremonial state car. 

For 1967, the &quot;7 Litre&quot; model no longer carried the Galaxie name; it was to be the last year of it being separately identified. That identification was mainly trim such as horn ring and dashboard markings as well as the &quot;Q&quot; in the Vehicle Identification Number. The 7 Litre for 1967 was a trim and performance option on the Ford XL, which was now a separate model as well. Little else changed, except for trim and the styling; the same engines were available, from the six-cylinder to the V8. Modifications to the styling included adding a major bend in the center of the grille and making the model less &quot;boxy&quot; than the 1966 model. An 8-track tape cartridge player became an option. Back-up lights were standard.

For 1967 all Fords featured a large, padded hub in the center of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual brake master cylinder used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).

The 1968 model had a new grille with headlights arranged horizontally, although the body was essentially the same car from the windshield back. The &#x27;long hood, short deck&#x27; style with a more upright roofline and a notchback rear was followed too, as was the new trend for concealed headlights on the &quot;XL&quot; and &quot;LTD&quot;. One other change for 1968 was that the base V8 engine increased from to . Standard equipment included courtesy lights, a cigarette lighter, a suspended gas pedal, and padded front seat backs.

The 1968 models featured additional safety features, including side marker lights and shoulder belts on cars built after December 1, 1967. The 1967 model&#x27;s large steering wheel hub was replaced by a soft &quot;bar&quot; spoke that ran through the diameter of the wheel (and like the 1967 style, was used throughout the Ford Motor Company line). A plastic horn ring was also featured.

== 1969–1974 ==
The 1969 model was built on a new platform with a wheelbase. It was the end for the 427 and 428 engines, save for only the police package versions which continued to use the 360 hp 428 P Code &#x27;Police Interceptor&#x27; as their top motor for 1969-70. Replacing the FE series-based 427 and 428 engines was the new &quot;ThunderJet&quot; that was introduced in the 1968 Ford Thunderbird; it was part of the new Ford 385 engine series. Power, at for the dual-exhaust 4-barrel version, was higher than the 428&#x27;s and lower than the racing-bred 427&#x27;s final rating of ; there was also a single-exhaust 2-barrel version with available. The dashboard was built as a pod around the driver rather than traditionally extending across both sides. The &quot;XL&quot; and &quot;Galaxie 500 Sportsroof&quot; had rear sail panels to simulate a fastback roofline. The rear trim panel below the tail lights was used to distinguish the different trim levels. The &quot;Country Squire&quot; was, perhaps, the pinnacle of design for that wagon with the concealed headlights.

Headrests were featured on 1969 model cars built after January 1, 1969. It was not until 1968 that a station wagon was actually marketed under the &quot;Galaxie&quot; name. From 1955 to 1968 full-size Ford wagons were treated as a separate model series and were listed as &quot;Ranch Wagon&quot;, &quot;Country Sedan&quot;, and &quot;Country Squire&quot;. For the 1969 model year a higher-trim &quot;Ranch Wagon&quot; was offered as the &quot;Custom 500 Ranch Wagon&quot;, the &quot;Country Sedan&quot; the &quot;Galaxie Country Sedan&quot; and the &quot;Country Squire&quot; was marketed as the &quot;LTD Country Squire&quot;.

Galaxies for model year 1970 received minor trim changes. A new ignition lock was located on the right side of the steering column. Model year 1970 was the last year for the XL, but Galaxie 500 hardtop coupes were also available in both formal-roof and SportsRoof body styles. The optional 4-speed manual transmission, which was available on the 429 the year prior, was dropped for 1970.

A complete redesign was offered for 1971. This included a horizontal wrap around front bumper with a massive vertical center section much in the vein of concurrent Pontiacs. Taillights lost the traditional &quot;rocket&quot; exhaust theme in favor of horizontal lights and trimmed center section. Rooflines were squared off and had a &quot;formal&quot; air. The &quot;XL&quot; was dropped, as were concealed headlight covers for the &quot;LTD&quot;. The convertible was moved to the &quot;LTD&quot; series in 1970 (1971 model year) and lasted through 1972. The engine line-up saw some changes for &#x27;71. The 351 2v V8 was now standard equipment on all full-sized Fords save for the lower-line Custom &amp; Custom 500 versions where the 240 straight six was still the base power plant with a 302 2v V8 and up still offered as options. The optional 390 2v FE V8 was replaced mid-year by a new 335 series 400 2v V8. The 429 4v was still the top engine, while the police-only versions received a new 370 hp 429 &#x27;Police Interceptor&#x27; as their new top offering. A column-shifted 3-speed manual was still the base transmission on the 240,302 &amp; 351 engines with Select-Shift automatic being optional but mandatory on all of the larger engines.

Models for 1972 were similar but the vertical center grille section was now not so prominent as the front bumper now continued across it and the rear bumper was enlarged with inset taillamps. This was also the final year for the six-cylinder engine and three-speed manual transmission (which was available only with the six-cylinder engine); all V8-powered Galaxies had SelectShift automatic transmission as standard equipment.

The 1973 model was marginally shorter than previous models, but had a heavier, bulker appearance. Three towing packages were optional, each with increasing towing capacity. For law men, there were multiple Police package versions available with engines ranging from the 351 2v to the powerful 460 Police Interceptor. Taxi packages continued to be offered as well. All 1973 full-sized Fords now came with a 351 2v V8-engine and SelectShift automatic transmission as their base driveline. Four-door sedans with metal door frames were replaced with a new &quot;Pillared Hardtop&quot; model which featured a thin &quot;B&quot; post and frameless door glass. This body style was offered together with the traditional pillarless four-door hardtop.

The 1974 model year was essentially a repeat of 1973, but it was the last year for the &quot;Galaxie 500&quot; name. Ford elected to consolidate most of its full-size models under the popular &quot;LTD&quot; name for 1975, while reserving the base-model Custom 500 (which was below the Galaxie 500) nameplate for fleet buyers and private customers who insisted on the lowest-priced full-sized model possible. Power front disc brakes were standard.

The &quot;LTD&quot; stayed on as the top full-size model. Although a top seller and high-end model for many years, the Galaxie was slowly phased out and de-emphasized by Ford Motor Co. in an effort to push the posher LTD as a mainstream full size car.

Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold over 1968–1978. This makes it the second best selling Ford automobile platform after the Ford Model T.

==Production statistics==

Total Series Production includes Custom, Custom 500, Seven Litre, Station Wagon, LTD, and all Galaxie models. Galaxie Production includes Galaxie, Galaxie 500, Galaxie 500XL, XL, and Galaxie 500 LTD when LTD was not a separate model (until 1966).

==Australian production==

The Ford Galaxie was also produced in Australia from late 1964 to 1968. The 1965 model, which was designated as the Galaxie GE series by Ford Australia, was assembled at Ford&#x27;s Homebush West plant in Sydney, and was offered as a 4-door sedan with a choice of or cid V8 engines. 1966, 1967 and 1968 models were also assembled at Homebush prior to a change to full importation from 1969, with conversion from left to right hand drive being undertaken at Ford&#x27;s Broadmeadows facility in Melbourne. The 1969 model was marketed as the Galaxie LTD, as were subsequent models through to the introduction of the locally developed Ford LTD in 1973.

Prior to local assembly which began in late 1964, small numbers of RHD full imports were sourced through select Australian Ford dealers, and also by Ford of Australia for executive use. RHD wagons, convertibles and fastbacks, 2- and 4-door hardtops, XLs and LTDs were generally sourced as full imports from Ford of Canada until approx 1968. The fully imported 1959 to early 1963 models used a 1959 U.S. Fairlane dashboard and instruments. In late 1963, a 1959 Edsel Corsair-based dashboard was used, and for 1964, a 1959 Edsel Ranger-based dashboard was used. However, some RHD 1963s and 1964s have been photographed with the more attractive U.S.-style 1964 cluster. Australian assembled 1965–1968 models were sourced in CKD form from Ford of Canada. The 1965–1967 model Galaxies adopted the RHD dashboard based on the 1963 Lincoln Continental. The 1967 models got the U.S.-market safety steering wheel with its thickly padded center hub. This wheel was retained for 1968, and the 1968 Torino cluster replaced the Continental version. Some right hand drive 1967 models have been seen with a mirror image of the US-style instrument panel for that year.

Australian assembled cars 1965–1968 received a woodgrain dashboard fascia, and accessories as standard, such as:
* Power steering
* Power brakes (front disc from 1967)
* Radio with 390 engine
* Automatic transmission
* Wipers and washers (single speed intermittent wipers for 1965–1966, 2-speed from 1967)
* 3-speed heater defroster

For the 1968 model year the 289 CID engine was dropped as the base option in favor of the new 302 CID (Windsor) V8.

Australian assembly of 1965 to 1968 model Galaxies from CKD kits totalled 3,124 vehicles with 1,766 of the 1969 to 1972 models converted to right-hand-drive in Australia.

==Brazilian production==

The 1966 four-door sedan version of the Galaxie was also produced in Brazil under the names Galaxie, Galaxie 500, LTD and Landau from 1967 to 1983.
Two units were used as the presidential car until 1990. Some of these ran neat ethanol (E100), and had 28 gallon fuel tanks.

The Brazilian production started in 1967, and finished in 1983. The 4 door sedan was the only body version available for that market.

The 1967 Brazilian Ford Galaxie was visually identical to its 1966 American counterpart. For that year model the only available engine was the Y-block v8, with a two barrel carburettor.

During the production, the 1967 body (or 1966 for the American market) remained - and received face-lifts through the years.

The main face-lift was in 1976, when the headlights became horizontally oriented, and the front end resembled the 1965 Lincoln Continental. Also from 1976, the V8 Windsor engine with a two barrel carburettor replaced the Y-block and became the only available option until the end of the Brazilian production in 1983.

<text>In geometry and complex analysis, a Möbius transformation of the complex plane is a rational function of the form
formula_1
of one complex variable ; here the coefficients , , , are complex numbers satisfying .

Geometrically, a Möbius transformation can be obtained by first applying the inverse stereographic projection from the plane to the unit sphere, moving and rotating the sphere to a new location and orientation in space, and then applying a stereographic projection to map from the sphere back to the plane. These transformations preserve angles, map every straight line to a line or circle, and map every circle to a line or circle.

The Möbius transformations are the projective transformations of the complex projective line. They form a group called the Möbius group, which is the projective linear group . Together with its subgroups, it has numerous applications in mathematics and physics.

Möbius geometries and their transformations generalize this case to any number of dimensions over other fields.

Möbius transformations are named in honor of August Ferdinand Möbius; they are an example of homographies, linear fractional transformations, bilinear transformations, and spin transformations (in relativity theory).

== Overview ==
Möbius transformations are defined on the extended complex plane formula_2 (i.e., the complex plane augmented by the point at infinity).

Stereographic projection identifies formula_3 with a sphere, which is then called the Riemann sphere; alternatively, formula_3 can be thought of as the complex projective line formula_5. The Möbius transformations are exactly the bijective conformal maps from the Riemann sphere to itself, i.e., the automorphisms of the Riemann sphere as a complex manifold; alternatively, they are the automorphisms of formula_5 as an algebraic variety. Therefore, the set of all Möbius transformations forms a group under composition. This group is called the Möbius group, and is sometimes denoted formula_7.

The Möbius group is isomorphic to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space and therefore plays an important role when studying hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

In physics, the identity component of the Lorentz group acts on the celestial sphere in the same way that the Möbius group acts on the Riemann sphere. In fact, these two groups are isomorphic. An observer who accelerates to relativistic velocities will see the pattern of constellations as seen near the Earth continuously transform according to infinitesimal Möbius transformations. This observation is often taken as the starting point of twistor theory.

Certain subgroups of the Möbius group form the automorphism groups of the other simply-connected Riemann surfaces (the complex plane and the hyperbolic plane). As such, Möbius transformations play an important role in the theory of Riemann surfaces. The fundamental group of every Riemann surface is a discrete subgroup of the Möbius group (see Fuchsian group and Kleinian group). A particularly important discrete subgroup of the Möbius group is the modular group; it is central to the theory of many fractals, modular forms, elliptic curves and Pellian equations.

Möbius transformations can be more generally defined in spaces of dimension as the bijective conformal orientation-preserving maps from the  to the -sphere. Such a transformation is the most general form of conformal mapping of a domain. According to Liouville&#x27;s theorem a Möbius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translations, similarities, orthogonal transformations and inversions.

== Definition ==
The general form of a Möbius transformation is given by
formula_8
where , , , are any complex numbers that satisfy .

In case , this definition is extended to the whole Riemann sphere by defining
formula_9

If , we define
formula_10

Thus a Möbius transformation is always a bijective holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere.

The set of all Möbius transformations forms a group under composition. This group can be given the structure of a complex manifold in such a way that composition and inversion are holomorphic maps. The Möbius group is then a complex Lie group. The Möbius group is usually denoted formula_7 as it is the automorphism group of the Riemann sphere.

If , the rational function defined above is a constant (unless , when it is undefined):
formula_12
where a fraction with a zero denominator is ignored. A constant function is not bijective and is thus not considered a Möbius transformation.

An alternative definition is given as the kernel of the Schwarzian derivative.

== Fixed points ==
Every non-identity Möbius transformation has two fixed points formula_13 on the Riemann sphere. The fixed points are counted here with multiplicity; the parabolic transformations are those where the fixed points coincide. Either or both of these fixed points may be the point at infinity.

=== Determining the fixed points ===
The fixed points of the transformation
formula_14
are obtained by solving the fixed point equation . For , this has two roots obtained by expanding this equation to
formula_15
and applying the quadratic formula. The roots are
formula_16
with discriminant
formula_17
where the matrix
formula_18
represents the transformation.
Parabolic transforms have coincidental fixed points due to zero discriminant. For &quot;c&quot; nonzero and nonzero discriminant the transform is elliptic or hyperbolic.

When , the quadratic equation degenerates into a linear equation and the transform is linear. This corresponds to the situation that one of the fixed points is the point at infinity. When the second fixed point is finite and is given by
formula_19

In this case the transformation will be a simple transformation composed of translations, rotations, and dilations:
formula_20

If and , then both fixed points are at infinity, and the Möbius transformation corresponds to a pure translation:
formula_21

=== Topological proof ===
Topologically, the fact that (non-identity) Möbius transformations fix 2 points (with multiplicity) corresponds to the Euler characteristic of the sphere being 2:
formula_22

Firstly, the projective linear group is sharply 3-transitive – for any two ordered triples of distinct points, there is a unique map that takes one triple to the other, just as for Möbius transforms, and by the same algebraic proof (essentially dimension counting, as the group is 3-dimensional). Thus any map that fixes at least 3 points is the identity.

Next, one can see by identifying the Möbius group with formula_23 that any Möbius function is homotopic to the identity. Indeed, any member of the general linear group can be reduced to the identity map by Gauss-Jordan elimination, this shows that the projective linear group is path-connected as well, providing a homotopy to the identity map. The Lefschetz–Hopf theorem states that the sum of the indices (in this context, multiplicity) of the fixed points of a map with finitely many fixed points equals the Lefschetz number of the map, which in this case is the trace of the identity map on homology groups, which is simply the Euler characteristic.

By contrast, the projective linear group of the real projective line, need not fix any points – for example formula_24 has no (real) fixed points: as a complex transformation it fixes ±&quot;i&quot; – while the map 2&quot;x&quot; fixes the two points of 0 and ∞. This corresponds to the fact that the Euler characteristic of the circle (real projective line) is 0, and thus the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says only that it must fix at least 0 points, but possibly more.

=== Normal form ===
Möbius transformations are also sometimes written in terms of their fixed points in so-called normal form. We first treat the non-parabolic case, for which there are two distinct fixed points.

&quot;Non-parabolic case&quot;:

Every non-parabolic transformation is conjugate to a dilation/rotation, i.e., a transformation of the form
formula_25
 with fixed points at 0 and ∞. To see this define a map
formula_26
which sends the points (&quot;γ&quot;1, &quot;γ&quot;2) to (0, ∞). Here we assume that &quot;γ&quot;1 and &quot;γ&quot;2 are distinct and finite. If one of them is already at infinity then &quot;g&quot; can be modified so as to fix infinity and send the other point to 0.

If &quot;f&quot; has distinct fixed points (&quot;γ&quot;1, &quot;γ&quot;2) then the transformation formula_27 has fixed points at 0 and ∞ and is therefore a dilation: formula_28. The fixed point equation for the transformation &quot;f&quot; can then be written
formula_29

Solving for &quot;f&quot; gives (in matrix form):
formula_30
or, if one of the fixed points is at infinity:
formula_31

From the above expressions one can calculate the derivatives of &quot;f&quot; at the fixed points:
formula_32 and formula_33

Observe that, given an ordering of the fixed points, we can distinguish one of the multipliers (&quot;k&quot;) of &quot;f&quot; as the characteristic constant of &quot;f&quot;. Reversing the order of the fixed points is equivalent to taking the inverse multiplier for the characteristic constant:
formula_34

For loxodromic transformations, whenever , one says that &quot;γ&quot;1 is the repulsive fixed point, and &quot;γ&quot;2 is the attractive fixed point. For , the roles are reversed.

&quot;Parabolic case&quot;:

In the parabolic case there is only one fixed point &quot;γ&quot;. The transformation sending that point to ∞ is
formula_35
or the identity if &quot;γ&quot; is already at infinity. The transformation formula_27 fixes infinity and is therefore a translation:
formula_37

Here, &quot;β&quot; is called the translation length. The fixed point formula for a parabolic transformation is then
formula_38

Solving for &quot;f&quot; (in matrix form) gives
formula_39Note that
formula_40

If :
formula_41

Note that &quot;β&quot; is &quot;not&quot; the characteristic constant of &quot;f&quot;, which is always 1 for a parabolic transformation. From the above expressions one can calculate:
formula_42

== Poles of the transformation ==

The point formula_43 is called the pole of formula_44; it is that point which is transformed to the point at infinity under .

The inverse pole formula_45 is that point to which the point at infinity is transformed. The point midway between the two poles is always the same as the point midway between the two fixed points:
formula_46

These four points are the vertices of a parallelogram which is sometimes called the characteristic parallelogram of the transformation.

A transform formula_44 can be specified with two fixed points &quot;γ&quot;1, &quot;γ&quot;2 and the pole formula_48.

formula_49

This allows us to derive a formula for conversion between &quot;k&quot; and formula_48 given formula_13:
formula_52
formula_53
which reduces down to
formula_54

The last expression coincides with one of the (mutually reciprocal) eigenvalue ratios formula_55 of formula_44 (compare the discussion in the preceding section about the characteristic constant of a transformation). Its characteristic polynomial is equal to
formula_57
which has roots
formula_58

== Simple Möbius transformations and composition ==

A Möbius transformation can be composed as a sequence of simple transformations.

The following simple transformations are also Möbius transformations:
* formula_59 is a translation.
* formula_60 is a combination of a homothety (uniform scaling) and a rotation. If formula_61 then it is a rotation, if formula_62 then it is a homothety.
* formula_63 (inversion and reflection with respect to the real axis)

=== Composition of simple transformations ===

If formula_64, let:
* formula_65 (translation by &quot;d&quot;/&quot;c&quot;)
* formula_66 (inversion and reflection with respect to the real axis)
* formula_67 (homothety and rotation)
* formula_68 (translation by &quot;a&quot;/&quot;c&quot;)

Then these functions can be composed, showing that, if 
formula_69
one has
formula_70
In other terms, one has
formula_71
with
formula_72

This decomposition makes many properties of the Möbius transformation obvious.

== Elementary properties ==
A Möbius transformation is equivalent to a sequence of simpler transformations. The composition makes many properties of the Möbius transformation obvious.

=== Formula for the inverse transformation ===
The existence of the inverse Möbius transformation and its explicit formula are easily derived by the composition of the inverse functions of the simpler transformations. That is, define functions &quot;g&quot;1, &quot;g&quot;2, &quot;g&quot;3, &quot;g&quot;4 such that each &quot;gi&quot; is the inverse of &quot;fi&quot;. Then the composition
formula_73
gives a formula for the inverse.

=== Preservation of angles and generalized circles ===
From this decomposition, we see that Möbius transformations carry over all non-trivial properties of circle inversion. For example, the preservation of angles is reduced to proving that circle inversion preserves angles since the other types of transformations are dilations and isometries (translation, reflection, rotation), which trivially preserve angles.

Furthermore, Möbius transformations map generalized circles to generalized circles since circle inversion has this property. A generalized circle is either a circle or a line, the latter being considered as a circle through the point at infinity. Note that a Möbius transformation does not necessarily map circles to circles and lines to lines: it can mix the two. Even if it maps a circle to another circle, it does not necessarily map the first circle&#x27;s center to the second circle&#x27;s center.

=== Cross-ratio preservation ===
Cross-ratios are invariant under Möbius transformations. That is, if a Möbius transformation maps four distinct points formula_74 to four distinct points formula_75 respectively, then
formula_76

If one of the points formula_74 is the point at infinity, then the cross-ratio has to be defined by taking the appropriate limit; e.g. the cross-ratio of formula_78 is
formula_79

The cross ratio of four different points is real if and only if there is a line or a circle passing through them. This is another way to show that Möbius transformations preserve generalized circles.

=== Conjugation ===
Two points &quot;z&quot;1 and &quot;z&quot;2 are conjugate with respect to a generalized circle &quot;C&quot;, if, given a generalized circle &quot;D&quot; passing through &quot;z&quot;1 and &quot;z&quot;2 and cutting &quot;C&quot; in two points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, are in harmonic cross-ratio (i.e. their cross ratio is −1). This property does not depend on the choice of the circle &quot;D&quot;. This property is also sometimes referred to as being symmetric with respect to a line or circle.

Two points &quot;z&quot;, &quot;z&quot;∗ are conjugate with respect to a line, if they are symmetric with respect to the line. Two points are conjugate with respect to a circle if they are exchanged by the inversion with respect to this circle.

The point &quot;z&quot;∗ is conjugate to &quot;z&quot; when &quot;L&quot; is the line determined by the vector based upon &quot;eiθ&quot;, at the point &quot;z&quot;0. This can be explicitly given as
formula_80

The point &quot;z&quot;∗ is conjugate to &quot;z&quot; when &quot;C&quot; is the circle of a radius &quot;r&quot;, centered about &quot;z&quot;0. This can be explicitly given as
formula_81

Since Möbius transformations preserve generalized circles and cross-ratios, they also preserve the conjugation.

== Projective matrix representations ==
=== Isomorphism between the Möbius group and ===
The natural action of on the complex projective line CP1 is exactly the natural action of the Möbius group on the Riemann sphere
==== Correspondance between the complex projective line and the Riemann sphere ====
Here, the projective line CP1 and the Riemann sphere are identified as follows:
formula_82

Here [&quot;z&quot;1:&quot;z&quot;2] are homogeneous coordinates on CP1; the point [1:0] corresponds to the point of the Riemann sphere. By using homogeneous coordinates, many calculations involving Möbius transformations can be simplified, since no case distinctions dealing with are required.

==== Action of PGL(2, C) on the complex projective line ====
Every invertible complex 2×2 matrix
formula_83
acts on the projective line as
formula_84
where
formula_85

The result is therefore 
formula_86

Which, using the above identification, corresponds to the following point on the Riemann sphere : 

formula_87

==== Equivalence with a Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere ====
Since the above matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is not zero, this induces an identification of the action of the group of Möbius transformations with the action of on the complex projective line. In this identification, the above matrix formula_88 corresponds to the Möbius transformation formula_89

This identification is a group isomorphism, since the multiplication of formula_88 by a non zero scalar formula_91 does not change the element of , and, as this multiplication consists of multiplying all matrix entries by formula_92 this does not change the corresponding Möbius transformation.

=== Other groups ===

For any field &quot;K&quot;, one can similarly identify the group of the projective linear automorphisms with the group of fractional linear transformations. This is widely used; for example in the study of homographies of the real line and its applications in optics. 

If one divides formula_44 by a square root of its determinant, one gets a matrix of determinant one. This induces a surjective group homomorphism from the special linear group to , with formula_94 as its kernel.

This allows showing that the Möbius group is a 3-dimensional complex Lie group (or a 6-dimensional real Lie group), which is a semisimple and non-compact, and that SL(2,C) is a double cover of . Since is simply-connected, it is the universal cover of the Möbius group, and the fundamental group of the Möbius group is Z2.

=== Specifying a transformation by three points ===

Given a set of three distinct points formula_95 on the Riemann sphere and a second set of distinct points , there exists precisely one Möbius transformation formula_96 with formula_97 for . (In other words: the action of the Möbius group on the Riemann sphere is &quot;sharply 3-transitive&quot;.) There are several ways to determine formula_96 from the given sets of points.

==== Mapping first to 0, 1, ====
It is easy to check that the Möbius transformation
formula_99
with matrix
formula_100
maps formula_101 to , respectively. If one of the &quot;formula_102&quot; is formula_103, then the proper formula for formula_104 is obtained from the above one by first dividing all entries by &quot;formula_102&quot; and then taking the limit .

If formula_106 is similarly defined to map formula_107 to formula_108 then the matrix formula_44 which maps formula_110 to formula_111 becomes
formula_112

The stabilizer of formula_113 (as an unordered set) is a subgroup known as the anharmonic group.

==== Explicit determinant formula ====
The equation
formula_114
is equivalent to the equation of a standard hyperbola
formula_115
in the formula_116-plane. The problem of constructing a Möbius transformation formula_117 mapping a triple formula_118 to another triple formula_119 is thus equivalent to finding the coefficients formula_120 of the hyperbola passing through the points . An explicit equation can be found by evaluating the determinant
formula_121
by means of a Laplace expansion along the first row, resulting in explicit formulae,
formula_122
for the coefficients formula_120 of the representing matrix . The constructed matrix formula_124 has determinant equal to , which does not vanish if the formula_102 resp. formula_126 are pairwise different thus the Möbius transformation is well-defined. If one of the points formula_102 or formula_126 is , then we first divide all four determinants by this variable and then take the limit as the variable approaches .

== Subgroups of the Möbius group ==
If we require the coefficients formula_120 of a Möbius transformation to be real numbers with , we obtain a subgroup of the Möbius group denoted as . This is the group of those Möbius transformations that map the upper half-plane to itself, and is equal to the group of all biholomorphic (or equivalently: bijective, conformal and orientation-preserving) maps . If a proper metric is introduced, the upper half-plane becomes a model of the hyperbolic plane &quot;H&quot;, the Poincaré half-plane model, and is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of &quot;H&quot; in this model.

The subgroup of all Möbius transformations that map the open disk to itself consists of all transformations of the form
formula_130
with and . This is equal to the group of all biholomorphic (or equivalently: bijective, angle-preserving and orientation-preserving) maps . By introducing a suitable metric, the open disk turns into another model of the hyperbolic plane, the Poincaré disk model, and this group is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of &quot;H&quot; in this model.

Since both of the above subgroups serve as isometry groups of &quot;H&quot;, they are isomorphic. A concrete isomorphism is given by conjugation with the transformation
formula_131
which bijectively maps the open unit disk to the upper half plane.

Alternatively, consider an open disk with radius &quot;r&quot;, centered at &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The Poincaré disk model in this disk becomes identical to the upper-half-plane model as &quot;r&quot; approaches ∞.

A maximal compact subgroup of the Möbius group formula_132 is given by 
formula_133
and corresponds under the isomorphism formula_134 to the projective special unitary group which is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group SO(3) of rotations in three dimensions, and can be interpreted as rotations of the Riemann sphere. Every finite subgroup is conjugate into this maximal compact group, and thus these correspond exactly to the polyhedral groups, the point groups in three dimensions.

Icosahedral groups of Möbius transformations were used by Felix Klein to give an analytic solution to the quintic equation in ; a modern exposition is given in .

If we require the coefficients &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; of a Möbius transformation to be integers with , we obtain the modular group , a discrete subgroup of important in the study of lattices in the complex plane, elliptic functions and elliptic curves. The discrete subgroups of are known as Fuchsian groups; they are important in the study of Riemann surfaces.

== Classification ==
In the following discussion we will always assume that the representing matrix formula_135 is normalized such that .

Non-identity Möbius transformations are commonly classified into four types, parabolic, elliptic, hyperbolic and loxodromic, with the hyperbolic ones being a subclass of the loxodromic ones. The classification has both algebraic and geometric significance. Geometrically, the different types result in different transformations of the complex plane, as the figures below illustrate.

The four types can be distinguished by looking at the trace formula_136. The trace is invariant under conjugation, that is,
formula_137
and so every member of a conjugacy class will have the same trace. Every Möbius transformation can be written such that its representing matrix formula_44 has determinant one (by multiplying the entries with a suitable scalar). Two Möbius transformations formula_139 (both not equal to the identity transform) with formula_140 are conjugate if and only if formula_141

=== Parabolic transforms ===
A non-identity Möbius transformation defined by a matrix formula_44 of determinant one is said to be &quot;parabolic&quot; if
formula_143
(so the trace is plus or minus 2; either can occur for a given transformation since formula_44 is determined only up to sign). In fact one of the choices for formula_44 has the same characteristic polynomial as the identity matrix, and is therefore unipotent. A Möbius transform is parabolic if and only if it has exactly one fixed point in the extended complex plane formula_146, which happens if and only if it can be defined by a matrix conjugate to
formula_147
which describes a translation in the complex plane.

The set of all parabolic Möbius transformations with a &quot;given&quot; fixed point in formula_3, together with the identity, forms a subgroup isomorphic to the group of matrices
formula_149
this is an example of the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup (of the Möbius group, or of for the matrix group; the notion is defined for any reductive Lie group).

=== Characteristic constant ===
All non-parabolic transformations have two fixed points and are defined by a matrix conjugate to
formula_150
with the complex number &quot;λ&quot; not equal to 0, 1 or −1, corresponding to a dilation/rotation through multiplication by the complex number , called the characteristic constant or multiplier of the transformation.

=== Elliptic transforms ===

The transformation is said to be &quot;elliptic&quot; if it can be represented by a matrix formula_88 of determinant 1 such that 
formula_152

A transform is elliptic if and only if and . Writing formula_153, an elliptic transform is conjugate to
formula_154
with &quot;α&quot; real.

For &quot;any&quot; formula_44 with characteristic constant &quot;k&quot;, the characteristic constant of formula_156 is &quot;kn&quot;. Thus, all Möbius transformations of finite order are elliptic transformations, namely exactly those where &quot;λ&quot; is a root of unity, or, equivalently, where &quot;α&quot; is a rational multiple of . The simplest possibility of a fractional multiple means , which is also the unique case of formula_157, is also denoted as a ; this corresponds geometrically to rotation by 180° about two fixed points. This class is represented in matrix form as:
formula_158
There are 3 representatives fixing {0, 1, ∞}, which are the three transpositions in the symmetry group of these 3 points: formula_159 which fixes 1 and swaps 0 with &quot;∞&quot; (rotation by 180° about the points 1 and −1), formula_160, which fixes &quot;∞&quot; and swaps 0 with 1 (rotation by 180° about the points 1/2 and &quot;∞&quot;), and formula_161 which fixes 0 and swaps 1 with &quot;∞&quot; (rotation by 180° about the points 0 and 2).

=== Hyperbolic transforms ===
The transform is said to be &quot;hyperbolic&quot; if it can be represented by a matrix formula_88 whose trace is real with
formula_163

A transform is hyperbolic if and only if &quot;λ&quot; is real and .

=== Loxodromic transforms ===
The transform is said to be &quot;loxodromic&quot; if formula_164 is not in . A transformation is loxodromic if and only if formula_165.

Historically, navigation by loxodrome or rhumb line refers to a path of constant bearing; the resulting path is a logarithmic spiral, similar in shape to the transformations of the complex plane that a loxodromic Möbius transformation makes. See the geometric figures below.

=== General classification ===

=== The real case and a note on terminology ===
Over the real numbers (if the coefficients must be real), there are no non-hyperbolic loxodromic transformations, and the classification is into elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic, as for real conics. The terminology is due to considering half the absolute value of the trace, |tr|/2, as the eccentricity of the transformation – division by 2 corrects for the dimension, so the identity has eccentricity 1 (tr/&quot;n&quot; is sometimes used as an alternative for the trace for this reason), and absolute value corrects for the trace only being defined up to a factor of ±1 due to working in PSL. Alternatively one may use half the trace &quot;squared&quot; as a proxy for the eccentricity squared, as was done above; these classifications (but not the exact eccentricity values, since squaring and absolute values are different) agree for real traces but not complex traces. The same terminology is used for the classification of elements of (the 2-fold cover), and analogous classifications are used elsewhere. Loxodromic transformations are an essentially complex phenomenon, and correspond to complex eccentricities.

== Geometric interpretation of the characteristic constant ==
The following picture depicts (after stereographic transformation from the sphere to the plane) the two fixed points of a Möbius transformation in the non-parabolic case:

The characteristic constant can be expressed in terms of its logarithm:
formula_166
When expressed in this way, the real number &quot;ρ&quot; becomes an expansion factor. It indicates how repulsive the fixed point &quot;γ&quot;1 is, and how attractive &quot;γ&quot;2 is. The real number &quot;α&quot; is a rotation factor, indicating to what extent the transform rotates the plane anti-clockwise about &quot;γ&quot;1 and clockwise about &quot;γ&quot;2.

=== Elliptic transformations ===
If , then the fixed points are neither attractive nor repulsive but indifferent, and the transformation is said to be &quot;elliptic&quot;. These transformations tend to move all points in circles around the two fixed points. If one of the fixed points is at infinity, this is equivalent to doing an affine rotation around a point.

If we take the one-parameter subgroup generated by any elliptic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the &quot;same&quot; two points. All other points flow along a family of circles which is nested between the two fixed points on the Riemann sphere. In general, the two fixed points can be any two distinct points.

This has an important physical interpretation.
Imagine that some observer rotates with constant angular velocity about some axis. Then we can take the two fixed points to be the North and South poles of the celestial sphere. The appearance of the night sky is now transformed continuously in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of elliptic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, ∞, and with the number &quot;α&quot; corresponding to the constant angular velocity of our observer.

Here are some figures illustrating the effect of an elliptic Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):

These pictures illustrate the effect of a single Möbius transformation. The one-parameter subgroup which it generates &quot;continuously&quot; moves points along the family of circular arcs suggested by the pictures.

=== Hyperbolic transformations ===

If &quot;α&quot; is zero (or a multiple of 2), then the transformation is said to be &quot;hyperbolic&quot;. These transformations tend to move points along circular paths from one fixed point toward the other.

If we take the one-parameter subgroup generated by any hyperbolic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the &quot;same&quot; two points. All other points flow along a certain family of circular arcs &quot;away&quot; from the first fixed point and &quot;toward&quot; the second fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.

This too has an important physical interpretation. Imagine that an observer accelerates (with constant magnitude of acceleration) in the direction of the North pole on his celestial sphere. Then the appearance of the night sky is transformed in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of hyperbolic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, ∞, with the real number &quot;ρ&quot; corresponding to the magnitude of his acceleration vector. The stars seem to move along longitudes, away from the South pole toward the North pole. (The longitudes appear as circular arcs under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane.)

Here are some figures illustrating the effect of a hyperbolic Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):

These pictures resemble the field lines of a positive and a negative electrical charge located at the fixed points, because the circular flow lines subtend a constant angle between the two fixed points.

=== Loxodromic transformations ===

If both &quot;ρ&quot; and &quot;α&quot; are nonzero, then the transformation is said to be &quot;loxodromic&quot;. These transformations tend to move all points in S-shaped paths from one fixed point to the other.

The word &quot;loxodrome&quot; is from the Greek: &quot;λοξος (loxos), &quot;slanting&quot; + δρόμος (dromos), &quot;course&quot;&quot;. When sailing on a constant bearing – if you maintain a heading of (say) north-east, you will eventually wind up sailing around the north pole in a logarithmic spiral. On the mercator projection such a course is a straight line, as the north and south poles project to infinity. The angle that the loxodrome subtends relative to the lines of longitude (i.e. its slope, the &quot;tightness&quot; of the spiral) is the argument of &quot;k&quot;. Of course, Möbius transformations may have their two fixed points anywhere, not just at the north and south poles. But any loxodromic transformation will be conjugate to a transform that moves all points along such loxodromes.

If we take the one-parameter subgroup generated by any loxodromic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the &quot;same&quot; two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, &quot;away&quot; from the first fixed point and &quot;toward&quot; the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.

You can probably guess the physical interpretation in the case when the two fixed points are 0, ∞: an observer who is both rotating (with constant angular velocity) about some axis and moving along the &quot;same&quot; axis, will see the appearance of the night sky transform according to the one-parameter subgroup of loxodromic transformations with fixed points 0, ∞, and with &quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;α&quot; determined respectively by the magnitude of the actual linear and angular velocities.

=== Stereographic projection ===
These images show Möbius transformations stereographically projected onto the Riemann sphere. Note in particular that when projected onto a sphere, the special case of a fixed point at infinity looks no different from having the fixed points in an arbitrary location.
== Iterating a transformation ==
If a transformation formula_44 has fixed points &quot;γ&quot;1, &quot;γ&quot;2, and characteristic constant &quot;k&quot;, then formula_168 will have formula_169.

This can be used to iterate a transformation, or to animate one by breaking it up into steps.

These images show three points (red, blue and black) continuously iterated under transformations with various characteristic constants.

And these images demonstrate what happens when you transform a circle under Hyperbolic, Elliptical, and Loxodromic transforms. In the elliptical and loxodromic images, the value of &quot;α&quot; is 1/10.


== Higher dimensions ==
In higher dimensions, a Möbius transformation is a homeomorphism of , the one-point compactification of , which is a finite composition of inversions in spheres and reflections in hyperplanes. Liouville&#x27;s theorem in conformal geometry states that in dimension at least three, all conformal transformations are Möbius transformations. Every Möbius transformation can be put in the form
formula_170
where formula_171, formula_172, formula_173 is an orthogonal matrix, and formula_174 is 0 or 2. The group of Möbius transformations is also called the Möbius group.

The orientation-preserving Möbius transformations form the connected component of the identity in the Möbius group. In dimension , the orientation-preserving Möbius transformations are exactly the maps of the Riemann sphere covered here. The orientation-reversing ones are obtained from these by complex conjugation.

The domain of Möbius transformations, i.e. , is homeomorphic to the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere formula_175. The canonical isomorphism between these two spaces is the Cayley transform, which is itself a Möbius transformation of . This identification means that Möbius transformations can also be thought of as conformal isomorphisms of formula_175. The &quot;n&quot;-sphere, together with action of the Möbius group, is a geometric structure (in the sense of Klein&#x27;s Erlangen program) called Möbius geometry.

== Applications ==

=== Lorentz transformation ===

An isomorphism of the Möbius group with the Lorentz group was noted by several authors: Based on previous work of Felix Klein (1893, 1897) on automorphic functions related to hyperbolic geometry and Möbius geometry, Gustav Herglotz (1909) showed that hyperbolic motions (i.e. isometric automorphisms of a hyperbolic space) transforming the unit sphere into itself correspond to Lorentz transformations, by which Herglotz was able to classify the one-parameter Lorentz transformations into loxodromic, elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic groups. Other authors include Emil Artin (1957), H. S. M. Coxeter (1965), and Roger Penrose, Wolfgang Rindler (1984), Tristan Needham (1997) and W. M. Olivia (2002). 

Minkowski space consists of the four-dimensional real coordinate space R4 consisting of the space of ordered quadruples of real numbers, together with a quadratic form
formula_177

Borrowing terminology from special relativity, points with are considered &quot;timelike&quot;; in addition, if , then the point is called &quot;future-pointing&quot;. Points with are called &quot;spacelike&quot;. The null cone &quot;S&quot; consists of those points where ; the &quot;future null cone&quot; &quot;N&quot;+ are those points on the null cone with . The celestial sphere is then identified with the collection of rays in &quot;N&quot;+ whose initial point is the origin of R4. The collection of linear transformations on R4 with positive determinant preserving the quadratic form &quot;Q&quot; and preserving the time direction form the restricted Lorentz group .

In connection with the geometry of the celestial sphere, the group of transformations is identified with the group of Möbius transformations of the sphere. To each , associate the hermitian matrix
formula_178

The determinant of the matrix &quot;X&quot; is equal to . The special linear group acts on the space of such matrices via

for each , and this action of preserves the determinant of &quot;X&quot; because . Since the determinant of &quot;X&quot; is identified with the quadratic form &quot;Q&quot;, acts by Lorentz transformations. On dimensional grounds, covers a neighborhood of the identity of . Since is connected, it covers the entire restricted Lorentz group . Furthermore, since the kernel of the action () is the subgroup , then passing to the quotient group gives the group isomorphism

Focusing now attention on the case when is null, the matrix &quot;X&quot; has zero determinant, and therefore splits as the outer product of a complex two-vector &quot;ξ&quot; with its complex conjugate:

The two-component vector &quot;ξ&quot; is acted upon by in a manner compatible with (). It is now clear that the kernel of the representation of on hermitian matrices is .

The action of on the celestial sphere may also be described geometrically using stereographic projection. Consider first the hyperplane in R4 given by &quot;x&quot;0 = 1. The celestial sphere may be identified with the sphere &quot;S&quot;+ of intersection of the hyperplane with the future null cone &quot;N&quot;+. The stereographic projection from the north pole of this sphere onto the plane takes a point with coordinates with
formula_179
to the point
formula_180

Introducing the complex coordinate
formula_181
the inverse stereographic projection gives the following formula for a point on &quot;S&quot;+:

{\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1}\\
x_2 &amp;= \frac{\zeta-\bar{\zeta}}{i(\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1)}\\
x_3 &amp;= \frac{\zeta\bar{\zeta}-1}{\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|4}}

The action of on the points of &quot;N&quot;+ does not preserve the hyperplane &quot;S&quot;+, but acting on points in &quot;S&quot;+ and then rescaling so that the result is again in &quot;S&quot;+ gives an action of on the sphere which goes over to an action on the complex variable &quot;ζ&quot;. In fact, this action is by fractional linear transformations, although this is not easily seen from this representation of the celestial sphere. Conversely, for any fractional linear transformation of &quot;ζ&quot; variable goes over to a unique Lorentz transformation on &quot;N&quot;+, possibly after a suitable (uniquely determined) rescaling.

A more invariant description of the stereographic projection which allows the action to be more clearly seen is to consider the variable as a ratio of a pair of homogeneous coordinates for the complex projective line CP1. The stereographic projection goes over to a transformation from to &quot;N&quot;+ which is homogeneous of degree two with respect to real scalings

which agrees with () upon restriction to scales in which formula_182 The components of () are precisely those obtained from the outer product
formula_183

In summary, the action of the restricted Lorentz group SO+(1,3) agrees with that of the Möbius group . This motivates the following definition. In dimension , the Möbius group Möb(&quot;n&quot;) is the group of all orientation-preserving conformal isometries of the round sphere &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; to itself. By realizing the conformal sphere as the space of future-pointing rays of the null cone in the Minkowski space R1,n+1, there is an isomorphism of Möb(&quot;n&quot;) with the restricted Lorentz group SO+(1,&quot;n&quot;+1) of Lorentz transformations with positive determinant, preserving the direction of time.

Coxeter began instead with the equivalent quadratic form .

He identified the Lorentz group with transformations for which is stable. Then he interpreted the &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s as homogeneous coordinates and , the null cone, as the Cayley absolute for a hyperbolic space of points . Next, Coxeter introduced the variables
formula_184
so that the Lorentz-invariant quadric corresponds to the sphere . Coxeter notes that Felix Klein also wrote of this correspondence, applying stereographic projection from to the complex plane formula_185 Coxeter used the fact that circles of the inversive plane represent planes of hyperbolic space, and the general homography is the product of inversions in two or four circles, corresponding to the general hyperbolic displacement which is the product of inversions in two or four planes.

=== Hyperbolic space ===
As seen above, the Möbius group acts on Minkowski space as the group of those isometries that preserve the origin, the orientation of space and the direction of time. Restricting to the points where in the positive light cone, which form a model of hyperbolic 3-space &quot;H&quot;, we see that the Möbius group acts on &quot;H&quot; as a group of orientation-preserving isometries. In fact, the Möbius group is equal to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space. If we use the Poincaré ball model, identifying the unit ball in R3 with &quot;H&quot;, then we can think of the Riemann sphere as the &quot;conformal boundary&quot; of &quot;H&quot;. Every orientation-preserving isometry of &quot;H&quot; gives rise to a Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere and vice versa.

<text>In lunar astronomy, libration is the cyclic variation in the apparent position of the Moon that is perceived by observers on the Earth and caused by changes between the orbital and rotational planes of the moon. It causes an observer to see slightly different hemispheres of the surface at different times. It is similar in both cause and effect to the changes in the Moon&#x27;s apparent size because of changes in distance. It is caused by three mechanisms detailed below, two of which cause a relatively tiny physical libration via tidal forces exerted by the Earth. Such true librations are known as well for other moons with locked rotation.

The quite different phenomenon of a trojan asteroid&#x27;s movement has been called &quot;Trojan libration&quot;, and &quot;Trojan libration point&quot; means Lagrangian point.

==Lunar libration==

The Moon keeps one of itself facing the Earth because of tidal locking. Therefore, the first view of the far side of the Moon was not possible until the Soviet probe Luna 3 reached the Moon on October 7, 1959, and further lunar exploration by the United States and the Soviet Union. This simple picture is only approximately true since over time, slightly &quot;more&quot; than half (about 59% in total) of the Moon&#x27;s surface is seen from Earth because of libration.

Lunar libration arises from three changes in perspective because of the non-circular and inclined orbit, the finite size of the Earth, and the orientation of the Moon in space. The first of these is called optical libration, the second parallax, and the third physical libration. Each of these can be divided into two contributions.

The following are the three types of lunar libration:
* Optical libration, the combined libration of longitudinal and latitudinal libration produces a movement of the sub-Earth point and a wobbling view between the temporarily visible parts of the Moon, during a lunar orbit. This is not to be confused with the change of the Moon&#x27;s apparent size because of the changing distance between the Moon and the Earth during the Moon&#x27;s elliptic orbit, or with the change of positional angle because of the change in the position of the Moon&#x27;s tilted axis, or with the observed swinging motion of the Moon because of the relative position of the Earth&#x27;s tilted axis during an orbit of the Moon.
** Libration in longitude results from the eccentricity of the orbit of the Moon around the Earth; the Moon&#x27;s rotation sometimes leads and sometimes lags its orbital position. The lunar libration in longitude was discovered by Johannes Hevelius in 1648. It can reach 7°54′ in amplitude. Longitudinal libration allows an observer on Earth to view at times further into the Moon&#x27;s west and east respectively at different phases of the Moon&#x27;s orbit.
** Libration in latitude results from the Moon&#x27;s axial tilt (about 6.7°) between its rotation axis and orbital axis around Earth. This is analogous to how Earth&#x27;s seasons arise from its axial tilt (about 23.4°) between its rotation axis and orbital axis about the Sun. Galileo Galilei is sometimes credited with the discovery of the lunar libration in latitude in 1632 although Thomas Harriot or William Gilbert might have done so before. Note Cassini&#x27;s laws. It can reach 6°50′ in amplitude. The 6.7° depends on the orbit inclination of 5.15° and the negative equatorial tilt of 1.54°. Latitudinal libration allows an observer on Earth to view beyond the Moon&#x27;s north pole and south pole at different phases of the Moon&#x27;s orbit.
* Parallax libration depends on both the longitude and latitude of the location on Earth from which the Moon is observed.
** Diurnal libration is the small daily libration and oscillation from Earth&#x27;s rotation, which carries an observer first to one side and then to the other side of the straight line joining Earth&#x27;s and the Moon&#x27;s centers, allowing the observer to look first around one side of the Moon and then around the other—since the observer is on Earth&#x27;s surface, not at its center. It reaches less than 1° in amplitude.
*Physical libration is the oscillation of orientation in space about uniform rotation and precession. There are physical librations about all three axes. The sizes are roughly 100 seconds of arc. As seen from the Earth, this amounts to less than 1 second of arc. Forced physical librations can be predicted given the orbit and shape of the Moon. The periods of free physical librations can also be predicted, but their amplitudes and phases cannot be predicted.

== Physical libration ==
Also called real libration, as opposed to the optical libration of longitudinal, latitudinal and diurnal types, the orientation of the Moon exhibits small oscillations of the pole direction in space and rotation about the pole.

This libration can be differentiated between forced and free libration. Forced libration is caused by the forces exerted during the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth and the Sun, and free libration represents oscillations that occur over longer time periods.

=== Forced physical libration ===

Cassini&#x27;s laws state the following:

# The Moon rotates uniformly about its polar axis keeping one side toward the Earth.
# The Moon&#x27;s equator plane is tilted with respect to the ecliptic plane and it precesses uniformly along the ecliptic plane. 
# The descending node of the equator on the ecliptic matches the ascending node of the orbit plane.

In addition to uniform rotation and uniform precession of the equator plane, the Moon has small oscillations of orientation in space about all three axes. These oscillations are called physical librations. Apart from the 1.5427° tilt between equator and ecliptic, the oscillations are approximately ±100 seconds of arc in size. These oscillations can be expressed with trigonometric series that depend on the lunar moments of inertia &quot;A&quot; &lt; &quot;B&quot; &lt; &quot;C&quot;. The sensitive combinations are &quot;β&quot; = (&quot;C&quot; – &quot;A&quot;)/&quot;B&quot; and &quot;γ&quot; = (&quot;B&quot; – &quot;A&quot;)/&quot;C&quot;. The oscillation about the polar axis is most sensitive to &quot;γ&quot; and the 2-dimensional direction of the pole, including the 1.5427° tilt, is most sensitive to &quot;β&quot;. Consequently, accurate measurements of the physical librations provide accurate determinations of &quot;β&quot; = and &quot;γ&quot; = .

The placement of three retroreflectors on the Moon by the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment and two retroreflectors by Lunokhod rovers allowed accurate measurement of the physical librations by laser ranging to the Moon.

=== Free physical libration ===
A free physical libration is similar to the solution of the reduced equation for linear differential equations. The periods of the free librations can be calculated, but their amplitudes must be measured. Lunar Laser Ranging provides the determinations. The two largest free librations were discovered by O. Calame. Modern values are: 
# 1.3 seconds of arc with a 1056-day (2.9-year) period for rotation about the polar axis, 
# a 74.6-year elliptical wobble of the pole of size 8.18 × 3.31 arcseconds, and 
# an 81-year rotation of the pole in space that is 0.03 seconds of arc in size.

The fluid core can cause a fourth mode with a period around four centuries. The free librations are expected to damp out in times very short compared to the age of the Moon. Consequently, their existence implies that there must be one or more stimulating mechanisms.

<doc id="314495" wikidata="Q2154888" url="?curid=314495" title="Ristar">
<text>Ristar is a 1995 platform game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. The game stars an anthropomorphic cartoon star who uses his hands and long, stretchable arms to both move and fight enemies. Reception for the game was generally positive, but the game&#x27;s initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis&#x27;s lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles.

While never receiving any sequels, Sega has re-released &quot;Ristar&quot; several times digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, including the Sega Forever line of releases for mobile devices. The character has additionally received various cameos in other Sega properties as well. A Game Gear game, &quot;Ristar&quot;, was also released, with different level design and gameplay mechanics.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Ristar&quot; is a 2D sidescrolling platform game, similar to games in the &quot;Super Mario&quot; or &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series of video games, but focusing less on jumping and speed, and more on the use of Ristar&#x27;s stretchable arms, which can reach in 8 different main directions. The player must maneuver Ristar through the level to its end, while avoiding damage from obstacles and enemies. Ristar&#x27;s extendable arms are used as the main means of attacking enemies; through extending his arms, grabbing the enemy, and pulling himself towards them into a &quot;headbutt&quot; motion to defeat them. The same motion also allows for opening treasure chests containing various items, or striking different parts of the environment, such as knocking trees over. Additionally, his elastic arms can merely be used for grabbing and/or throwing objects as well.

Beyond attacking, Ristar&#x27;s arms are also used as a method of projecting him through levels. Many pole-like structures are present to swing Ristar from one side to another, across gaps or to ascend or descend platforms vertically. Ristar is also able to grab on to enemies and objects in mid-air and swing on them. Additionally, &quot;Star Handles&quot; are placed in levels, where the player must have Ristar grab and use momentum to swing him around in a 360 degrees circle. Letting go launches him off in a given direction, dependent on the time of release. If enough momentum is gained, sparkles appear behind Ristar and he performs a move called the &quot;Meteor Strike&quot;, which makes him invincible and able to defeat any enemy upon touching them. When enough momentum is lost, usually a few seconds, flight ceases, and he drops to the ground back into his normal state, though this can be extended by bouncing off walls and ceilings during flight.

Every level ends with a special &quot;Star Handle&quot;, which is used to launch Ristar through the end of the level. Bonus points are awarded based on Ristar&#x27;s altitude when flying offscreen, similar to how levels are ended in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Additionally, every level also contains one hidden handle that sends Ristar to a bonus stage, which involve getting through an obstacle course within a given time limit. Completing the level in a particularly fast time will earn a continue, and after the game is completed, special codes are awarded depending on how many were completed. Ristar&#x27;s health is shown through an icon based health system consisting of four stars in the upper-right corner of the screen. Taking damage removes one star, and losing all stars causes Ristar to lose a life. Locating and grabbing a Ristar figure grants Ristar an extra life, while finding traditional star figures replenish his health; a yellow star replenishes one star, while a blue star restores all four.

==Plot==
Much like other games from the same timeframe, the game&#x27;s story varied between the Japanese language release and its English language counterpart. In all versions of the game, the events take place in a far off galaxy, where an evil space pirate, Kaiser Greedy, has used mind control to make the planets&#x27; leaders obey him. In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Planet Neer (Flora in the international version) pray for a hero before Greedy&#x27;s mind control minion, Riho, snatches the planet elder. The desperate prayers reach the mother of shooting stars, Oruto. She awakens one of her children, Ristar, with the sole purpose of granting the wishes of the innocent people. He must stop Greedy and the brainwashed leaders of each world to restore peace to the Valdi System.

In the international version, Oruto is omitted altogether. Instead, Ristar has a father, the legendary hero, who is a shooting star that protects the constellation of Valjee. Rather than Oruto awakening Ristar, the legendary hero was kidnapped by Greedy, and it is up to Ristar to rescue his father as well. The Japanese version of the game ends with Greedy and two of his underlings, Inonis and Uranim, stranded on a deserted planet, with a picture of Ristar appearing in the space, while Greedy simply stares at it. The ending scene in the international version shows Ristar being reunited with his father once again.

==Development==
In the early 1990s, Sega asked its development teams to create a mascot to rival Nintendo&#x27;s Mario. One proposed character had long rabbit-like ears which could extend and pick up objects, but this was discarded as too complex The team moved on to animals that could roll into a ball, and settled on Sonic the Hedgehog. Some years later, Sega developed another prototype, &quot;Feel,&quot; with a character that used its arms to pick things up instead of ears, which became Ristar.

In a 1994 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; interview, Sega marketing staff Lisa Best and Terry Tang claimed &quot;Ristar&quot; was not designed by the same &quot;Sonic&quot; programming team, although much of the game&#x27;s staff would later go on to create &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; for the Saturn, the next game to be officially credited to Sonic Team. This, along with &quot;Ristar&#x27;s&quot; inclusion in a number of &quot;Sonic&quot; themed compilations and re-releases in subsequent years, would lead game journalists to retroactively label the game as being developed by Sonic Team.

===Localization===
A number of small changes were made in localizing the version released for English-speaking countries. The story was altered slightly; in the Japanese version, a star mother, Oruto, summons Ristar&#x27;s help, where in the international version, Oruto is omitted completely, and Ristar&#x27;s father, a &quot;legendary hero&quot;, is referenced instead.

The boss of the ice themed level, Itamor, was changed from a large cat robot to an ice monster type robot. In the game, Ristar must grab hot dishes of food, and throw it in Itamor&#x27;s mouth. In Japan, it was considered clever to use &quot;hot food&quot; to defeat a cat, due to a Japanese cultural reference regarding a &quot;cat-tongue&quot; not liking hot food. In English-speaking regions, that reference is non-existent, so it was changed to a &quot;cold ice monster&quot; being defeated by being melted by &quot;hot food&quot;.

The rest of the changes were very minor edits in effort to appeal to western audiences, such as minor graphical changes to make Ristar and other character&#x27;s faces look more serious, renaming levels to names more descriptive of their looks, and adding a few non-interactive scenes to show more continuity in the game, such as a skiing sequence before the snow themed level, or putting on anti-gravity shoes to explain why Ristar is floating in a particular level.

==Reception==
In 1994, Sega was originally pitching &quot;Ristar&quot; to be the successor of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. However, the game never received massive exposure or sales, mainly due to being released just three months prior to the Sega Saturn, Sega&#x27;s successor to the Genesis, overshadowing it.

Reviews for the game were generally favorable. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; gave the game an 87% rating, praising the gameplay, graphics, and music, but complaining that the game lacked some originality and borrowed a lot from other platforming games at the time, such as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;, and &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;. &quot;Sega Pro&quot; praised it for both its similarities and differences from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, stating &quot;if you judged games purely by their visual looks, then you&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking that this WAS &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. But when you actually sit back and start playing it, you&#x27;ll discover that this is a much slower, strategic game. There is a big puzzle element here, which should make it stand out from the hundreds of other platformers in the market&quot;. &quot;Sega Power&quot; made a number of similar points, comparing the gameplay to a mix &quot;between &quot;Sonic&quot; and &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;&quot;, but criticized its short length and lack of originality, and only gave it a 74 rating: &quot;...if you like &quot;Sonic&quot; games, you will like this&quot; but that &quot;...it&#x27;s not as good as &quot;Sonic&quot; either&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; likewise remarked that Ristar feels &quot;sluggish&quot; in comparison to Sonic, and criticized that Ristar has few animations compared to other platformer stars and that the game&#x27;s low difficulty makes it suitable only for beginning gamers. Despite this, they gave the game an overall recommendation based on the colorful visuals and cleverly designed gameplay. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s team of five reviewers gave it a 7.6 out of 10, with Mike Weigand summarizing: &quot;An excellent new character, &quot;Ristar&quot; requires more technique than the typical run-and-jump action titles&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, while noting that &quot;Ristar&quot; borrowed heavily from &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;, contended that the player character has more than enough originality and versatility to go beyond being a mere clone. Citing the excellent stage design, &quot;slick transparencies, original bosses, and great music&quot;, he deemed it &quot;one of the best platform games to date&quot;. Despite this, he gave it only three out of five stars. &quot;Famitsu&quot; scored the game a 29 out of 40.

&quot;Ristar&quot; received considerably more positive reviews over a decade later upon being re-released digitally and as part of &quot;Sonic&quot; and Sega themed game compilations. &quot;IGN&quot; gave the Virtual Console version an eight out of ten, praising the game&#x27;s graphics, music and gameplay, and closed with saying &quot;platformer fans would do well to give this one a look&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the Virtual Console release as well, especially its graphics, stating: &quot;Visually, the developers made the best of the system&#x27;s limited color palette and employed every graphical trick they could to make the game look snazzy. Ristar and his enemies have a good variety of animations, but what you&#x27;ll probably notice the most are the colorful, multilayered backgrounds that constantly flaunt animated details in the form of moving clouds, falling debris, and rampaging creatures that have a habit of hurling things at you from a distance&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; scored it at 9/10 and referred to the game as one of the best of the system in regards to graphics, animation, and gameplay, writing: &quot;&quot;Ristar&quot; proves that taking a radical approach to play control in a platformer can sometimes really pay off in the end. Not only did Sonic Team create a game that easily differentiates itself from their &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, they&#x27;ve also come up with some of the most unique game play ideas to come out of the 16-bit era and a game that&#x27;s every bit as much fun to play today as it was almost 15 years ago when it was first released&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; referred to the game as &quot;excellent&quot; and referred to it as the &quot;most entertaining&quot; of the four non-&quot;Sonic&quot; games in &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot;. AllGame echoed the sentiment, referring to it as &quot;being as good if not better than any of the included &quot;Sonic&quot; games in &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; and as &quot;an overlooked gem&quot; as part of &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was less positive in their review, giving it a B− review score due to the perceived redundancy and recycling of ideas from the &quot;Sonic&quot; series.

In a retrospective piece by Levi Buchanan of &quot;IGN&quot;, he praised the graphics and gameplay as being great for the aging Sega Genesis, but also asserted that the platform hurt the game&#x27;s ability to succeed with sales and visibility: &quot;Ristar&quot; never stood a chance. The game was released in early 1995, just as the videogame world was moving on to the next generation of hardware. Sega was concentrating on the impending release of the Saturn and Sonic was still a monster success. And so &quot;Ristar&quot; was put to pasture&quot;. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked &quot;Ristar&quot; 41st on their &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.&quot;

==Legacy==
In a 2006 interview, &quot;Ristar&quot; designer Akira Nishino said:Will Ristar come back? Probably not. Of course, as a game developer, I would love to see it happen. At the time of the original, I was thinking of a sequel. It got as far as a character design for that sequel, but it didn&#x27;t happen for various reasons. But since fans have a say in such matters, your input is greatly appreciated.

While &quot;Ristar&quot; has never received any sequels, it has received further attention in later years through re-releases in several &quot;Sonic&quot; and Sega-themed compilations, including &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot;, &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot;, &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; and &quot;Sega Forever&quot;. It has also been released for digital download for the Virtual Console and Steam. In 2021, it was released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The game was also included on the North American and European edition of the Sega Genesis Mini 2, released on October 27, 2022.

Ristar, as a character, has only made a few minor cameo appearances outside of his two original games in 1995. In Sega&#x27;s two &quot;Shenmue&quot; games for the Dreamcast, &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;Shenmue II&quot;, the player can choose to spend money to purchase a randomly selected collectible &#x27;Gachapons&#x27; (capsule toys) from a machine; one of the possibilities in both games is a Ristar figurine. He also briefly appeared in the introductory video of the 2001 Japan-only Dreamcast game &quot;Segagaga&quot;. Ristar did not make any more appearances until 2010, where he makes a cameo appearance in a downloadable track for &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot; due to the high demand for him to be in the game. He also made an appearance as a flagman in the sequel, &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;, in 2012. In 2012, &quot;Ristar&quot; was cited by &quot;GameSpot&quot; as one of the examples of lost video games from the 1990s that deserved to return.

<text>Gandia (, ) is a city and municipality in the Valencian Community, eastern Spain on the Mediterranean. Gandia is located on the Costa de Valencia, south of Valencia and north of Alicante. Vehicles can access the city through road N-332 and AP-7 highway.

Gandia operated as an important cultural and commercial centre in the 15th and 16th centuries: in the 15th century it had a university. It was home to several important people, including the poet Ausiàs March (1400-1459) and the novelist Joanot Martorell (1410-1465). It is perhaps best known for the Borja or Borgia, through their family title, Duke of Gandia (originally created in 1399).

 Gandia is one of the largest coastal towns in Spain, with a population of over 200,000 during summer, and a centre of commerce and tourism in its region. There are two main zones, Gandia City, which has all the historical monuments, commercial activity, and shopping, and Gandia beach, which has apartments and summer residences used during the summer season. The bars and nightclubs are concentrated in the beach area. As is normal for Spain, nightlife does not begin until well after midnight. The beach and town are actually some apart, which succeeds in separating summer tourism from day-to-day living.

==Culture==
For culture, there are literary contests, the Summer University (Universitat d&#x27;Estiu), the International Festival of Classical Music and art exhibitions; sports include water, golf, tennis and hiking. Gandia hosts the annual Cortoons Gandia animation festival in April, which celebrates international animation and short films.

===Tourism===

With its long, wide, golden, sandy beaches Gandia is one of the major tourist destinations in Spain. Traditionally Gandia&#x27;s tourism has a domestic base, with the majority coming from Madrid, although in recent years it has been an increasingly popular destination for international tourists, mainly French, German and British.

There are some popular Spanish restaurants around the beach.

Gandia has a number of shopping facilities including shopping malls and chain supermarkets like Carrefour, Carrefour Express, Lidl, Mercadona and Aldi.

====Main sights====
* Collegiate Basilica of Gandia
* Ducal Palace of Gandia
* Convent of Santa Clara of Gandia
* Archaeological Museum of Gandia
* Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba
* Route of the Borgias
* Route of the Monasteries of Valencia
* Route of the Valencian classics

==Geography==

Gandia has an important regional wetland with an extension above in the outskirts of the city, called Marjal de La Safor. This natural area is home to several water plants such as Lemna gibba, Lemna minor, and specially many species of water lily plants, such as Nymphaea alba, Utricularia australis and Potamogeton fluitans. Underwater plants also exist, such as Myriophyllum and Ceratophyllum. Native land plants are mostly formed of various Phragmites species, Typha domingensis, various Scirpus and Cladium species.

Various species of palm trees are naturalised in the area, and they are also found widely in the marjal due to seed dispersion, either wind or animal dispersion. The most common naturalised palm trees in the area are Phoenix dactylifera (African date palm), Washingtonia robusta (Mexican fan palm) and Phoenix canariensis (Canary Island date palm). There are some specimens of the native palm tree Chamaerops humilis (European palmetto), although very few compared to the naturalised species.

This natural zone is also rich in fauna, with many species of birds, fish, amphibian and reptiles, with some mammal species. The most common species of birds are Tachybaptus ruficollis, Anas platyrhynchos, Falco tinnunculus, Fulica atra and Gallinula chloropus amongst many other species. The most common fish and amphibian species are Cobitis maroccana, Anguilla anguilla, Syngnathus abaster, Bufo bufo, Bufo calamita and Rana perezi.

The most common reptiles are turtles, with a native species (Emys orbicularis) which is in critical condition due to the heavy expansion of the Trachemys scripta scripta and Trachemys scripta elegans, most known as Florida turtles, which are introduced species in Spain. Other species of reptiles are Tarentola mauritanica, Podarcis hispanicus and Natrix maura amongst others.

The most common and native mammals are the European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the greater white-toothed shrew Musaranya comuna (Crocidura russula), the European bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and the wild hog (Sus scrofa) amongst others.

===Climate===
The climate of Gandia is Mediterranean (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with mild winters, and hot summers. The annual average temperature is between 18-19 °C. Gandia receives about 600mm of rain per year, the majority falling from September to November. Autumn is the wettest season.

==Sports==
The local football team is CF Gandía.

==International relations==

* Laval in France

== Public transport ==
Gandia has an extensive bus network and two Renfe stations that connect the city with Valencia (despite the fact that one of them only has three daily services). Buses in the Gandia area are operated by the company La Marina Gandiense and L&#x27;Urbanet. There are two La Marina Gandiense lines: line 1 that connects Gandia with the nearby municipality of Real de Gandia (and sometimes with the University) and line 2, which connects Gandia to the beach, which is 5 km (3,107 miles) away from the city. In L’Urbanet, there are three lines, although one of them is divided, which would be counted as four. The following lines are:

Line 3: Circular. Starts and ends at the Renfe station in Gandia city

Line 4: Gandia train station - San Francisco de Borja hospital

Line 5: This line has the peculiarity that despite being the same line it makes two totally different routes, which are:
* Gandia train station - Marenys de Rafalcaid
* Gandia train station - Marchuquera

There are also bus lines that connect Gandia with nearby villages such as Daimuz, Guardamar de la Safor, Oliva, etc. There are also some buses which connect Gandia with cities such as Madrid, Salamanca, Medina del Campo, Tordesillas, Teruel, Zaragoza, Bilbao, Galicia, Barcelona, Alicante and Andalucía.

Referring to train services, Gandia has two train stations which connect Gandia with Valencia. Both of them are terminal of line C-1 from Cercanías Valencia. The following stations are: 
* Gandia
* Platja i Grau de Gandia (this one gives service to Gandia’s beach, causing only three daily trains to reach this station)

<text>Victor B. Cline (1925–2013) was a University of California, Berkeley Ph D in Psychology, a research scientist with the George Washington University’s Human Resources Research Office, and an Emeritus Professor in Psychology at the University of Utah. His private clinical practice was in Salt Lake City, Utah.

==Career==

Due to his studies on the effects of pornography, Cline has been utilized as an expert witness in court cases and by the US Judiciary Committee. Cline&#x27;s opinion was requested by the Commission on Child Online Protection, which is associated with San Jose State University. Cline provided the following testimony:
According to Cline, online pornography can plunge a person into the pornography cycle of addiction, escalation, desensitization, and acting out sexually. The cost of addiction includes &quot;divorce, loss of family and problems with the law,&quot; and it escalates so that the addict requires more deviancy in order to get a &quot;high&quot; or &quot;sexual turn-on.&quot;

<text>Leonard Kriegel (May 25, 1933 – September 25, 2022) was an American author and self-proclaimed &quot;cripple&quot;. His writing included essays, stories, and novels. He contracted polio at the age of 11, leaving him confined to steel braces and crutches shortly after. Kriegel recounted his experience with the illness in his memoir, &quot;The Long Walk Home&quot;, published in 1964. He received both Guggenheim and Rockefeller Fellowships, and three of his books were named &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Books of the Year.

==Early life==
Kriegel was born in the Bronx on May 25, 1933. His father, Fred, worked as a deli counterman; his mother, Sylvia (Breittholz), was a housewife. Kriegel grew up in the neighborhood of Norwood. He caught polio during summer camp in 1944 and consequently remained at the New York State Reconstruction Home in West Haverstraw for two years. After being unsuccessfully treated, he went back to his home borough and finished his secondary school at home with visiting teachers. Kriegel opted not to use a wheelchair – believing that it suggested surrender to his illness – and consequently taught himself how to use braces and crutches to walk. He studied at Hunter College, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He then obtained a master&#x27;s degree at Columbia University, before being awarded a Doctor of Philosophy from New York University. The subject of his thesis was the writer and critic Edmund Wilson.

==Career==
Kriegel first taught at Long Island University, before teaching at the City College of New York and becoming director of its Center for Worker Education. He published his first book, &quot;The Long Walk Home&quot;, in 1964. The memoir bluntly described his experience with polio and his resulting anger, and utilized the term &quot;cripple&quot; at his insistence (a phrase that would be used throughout his later works). He recounted telling his wife how he wanted his work to be &quot;free of the sentimentality and cant and papier-mâché religiosity usually found in such books&quot;, at a time when it was uncommon to openly talk about the illness. Richard Shepard described the memoir in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;superb craft and keen insight ... written without a trace of false sentimentality or phony revelation&quot;. Another reviewer, in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, noted that it had &quot;flashes of insight and self-understanding amid sordidness and frequently unnecessary obscene realism&quot;.

Kriegel went on to author several other books, including &quot;Working Through: A Teacher’s Journey in the Urban University&quot; (1972), &quot;Notes for the Two-Dollar Window: Portraits From an American Neighborhood&quot; (1976), &quot;On Men and Manhood&quot; (1979), and &quot;Quitting Time&quot; (1982). He also released &quot;Flying Solo: Reimagining Manhood, Courage, and Loss&quot;, a collection of mostly autobiographical essays, in 1998. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for general nonfiction in 1971. Four years later, he was conferred a Rockefeller fellowship. Kriegel also received a MacDowell fellowship in 1976, the O. Henry Award, and three of his books were named &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Books of the Year.

==Personal life==
Kriegel was married to Harriet Bernzweig until his death. Together, they had two children.

Kriegel died on September 25, 2022, in Manhattan. He was 89, and suffered from heart failure prior to his death.

<text>Meilen is a municipality in the district of Meilen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.

== History ==

Archaeological finds in Meilen date back more than 4,000 years. In January 1854 the level of lake Zürich was particularly low and the locals took the chance to reclaim some land. During this undertaking prehistoric objects from the Pfyn, Horgen and early Bronze Age cultures were unearthed providing clear evidence of early settlement.

The locals also unearthed coins from Roman times (1st to 3rd century AD). One of the Roman roads connected &quot;Turicum&quot; (Zürich) with places up to &quot;Chur&quot; and passed by Meilen. Many findings were discovered during more recent road construction.

Parts of Meilen were possessions of monasteries, including the monastery of &quot;St. Gallen&quot;, the ones of &quot;Einsiedeln&quot; and &quot;Säckingen&quot;, or the more local &quot;Grossmünster&quot; of Zürich. Meilen is first mentioned between 820 and 880 as &quot;Meilana&quot;.

The town&#x27;s coat of arms shows two castle towers which represent the castle of &quot;Friedberg&quot;, the local castle. The castle was built around 1200 but was extended in the 14th century. Some remains are still visible, including the fountain which reaches down 29 metres. Wine making in Meilen dates back for centuries.

In 1384 Meilen became a bailiwick of Zürich. Thanks to the reeve Meilen enjoyed relative autonomy until 1798. Since the Middle Ages local trade and handicraft was established in Meilen. There were at least four mills to support the local agriculture. Towards the end of the 18th century, industrialisation arrived in Meilen in form of textiles, but this form of production disappeared in the 19th century. With the arrival of the railway in 1894 local trade and industry blossomed. The ferry to Horgen was opened in 1933.

<text>Joseph Edgar Foreman (born July 28, 1974), better known by his stage name Afroman, is an American rapper. His debut studio album, &quot;The Good Times&quot; (2001), featured the singles &quot;Because I Got High&quot; and &quot;Crazy Rap&quot;. He was nominated for a Grammy Award the following year.

==Early life==
Joseph Edgar Foreman was born on July 28, 1974, in Los Angeles, California. He initially grew up in the state of Mississippi before moving back to South Central Los Angeles at an early age. He later lived in the High Desert Southern California city of Palmdale, briefly in Las Vegas, Nevada, and then Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

==Career==
The first song Afroman wrote was entitled &quot;Hairy Carrie&quot;. He stated it was written during his time in middle school and was a &quot;diss song&quot; about a student known for her cruel harassment of fellow students concerning their appearances.

His musical career began in the eighth grade when he began recording homemade songs and selling them to his classmates. He later recalled: &quot;The first tape I made was about my eighth-grade teacher. She got me kicked out of school for sagging my pants, which was a big deal back then. So I wrote this song about her and it sold about 400 copies: it was selling to teachers, students, just about everybody. And I realized that, even though I wasn&#x27;t at school, my song was at school, so in a way I was still there. All these people would come by my house just to give me comments about how cool they thought the song was.&quot; Foreman also performed in his church at a young age, playing both the drums and guitar.

In 1998, Afroman released his first album, &quot;My Fro-losophy&quot;, which was described as a &quot;flop&quot;. The following year, he released &quot;Sell Your Dope&quot; and relocated to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where he met drummer Jody Stallone, keyboardist/bassist Darrell Havard, and producer Tim Ramenofsky (a.k.a. Headfridge). Afroman attributes his musical success in part to his relocation. In a 2023 interview with DJ Vlad, he stated Midwesterners and Southerners were more willing than people in LA to experiment with their taste in music.

Ramenofsky produced and released Afroman&#x27;s album &quot;Because I Got High&quot; in 2000 on T-Bones Records; it was distributed primarily through local concerts and the file-sharing service Napster before its title track was played on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. The song humorously describes how cannabis use is degrading the narrator&#x27;s quality of life. In late 2001, the song became a hit and was featured in the 2000s films &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Score&quot;, and &quot;Disturbia&quot;. &quot;Because I Got High&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 2002.

After the single&#x27;s success, Afroman joined the lineup of Cypress Hill&#x27;s fall festival &quot;Smoke Out&quot; with the Deftones, Method Man, and others. After this, Universal Records signed Afroman to a six-album deal, and Universal released &quot;The Good Times&quot; in 2001. &quot;The Good Times&quot; was a compilation of Afroman&#x27;s first two albums and also featured new songs.

Afroman started releasing his music independently and mostly through the Internet in 2004, and that year, he recorded &quot;Jobe Bells&quot;, which satirized traditional Christmas songs.

Afroman was part of the 2010 Gathering of the Juggalos lineup.

In October 2014, Afroman released a remix of his hit song &quot;Because I Got High&quot; in order to highlight the usefulness of cannabis as part of the effort to legalize its sale across the United States.

==Personal life==

===Religion===
In 2003, Afroman declared himself a Christian. In January 2023, he released an hour-long video on YouTube titled &quot;How To Be Happy In An Unhappy World - Sermon By Afroman&quot; detailing his experiences and understanding on life&#x27;s issues and how to overcome tribulations through faith in the word of God.

===Assault case===
On February 17, 2015, Afroman was midway through his performance at a live music venue in Biloxi, Mississippi, when a woman walked on stage. While dancing and holding a drink, she approached Afroman from behind. Afroman punched her in the face and was eventually escorted offstage by security. He was taken into custody, charged with assault, and released on bond shortly thereafter.

There were reportedly 12 to 15 security guards on duty to manage a crowd in excess of 500 people. According to Afroman&#x27;s representative, he had punched the woman as an involuntary reaction to the invasion of his personal space. Afroman also stated that he mistook her for another audience member who had been heckling him throughout the performance. He publicly apologized and sought assistance with anger management.

===Raid on Ohio home===
In August 2022, the Adams County, Ohio Sheriff&#x27;s Department searched Afroman&#x27;s home on suspicion of kidnapping and drug trafficking. Nothing was found during the search, and according to Afroman he &quot;had nothing more in his house than the ends of a few blunts and unused pipes made for him by fans.&quot; No charges were presented against Afroman. 

Afroman, who was in Chicago when his neighbors informed him of the raid, posted about the experience on social media, and criticized the officers for raiding his home and causing damage to his property. He also posted about a previous burglary on his home where he was threatened with arrest by the sheriff&#x27;s department if he kept checking about the progress of the case and was told they did not have time to provide him with an update. The search of Afroman&#x27;s home damaged his door, external gate, and security system wiring, which cost over $20,000 to repair. During the raid officers also seized over $5,000 of cash from his home. The cash was later returned to him, but with $400 missing. 

He recorded a trio of songs criticizing the raid, titled &quot;Will You Help Me Repair My Door&quot;, “Lemon Pound Cake&quot; (also the name of his album, set to the tune of &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; by The Drifters) and &quot;Why You Disconnecting My Video Camera&quot;, and released three music videos composed primarily of security camera recordings of the raid, to his YouTube account, on December 29, 2022.

On March 14, 2023, seven police officers from the Adams County Sheriff&#x27;s office sued Afroman, alleging that his use of their personas from the video of the raid was an invasion of the officers&#x27; privacy. Afroman tried to get the case dismissed. The court dismissed the claim that he improperly used the officer&#x27;s likeness for commercial purposes, but let the claim that he defamed and placed the officers in a false light go to trial.

=== 2024 presidential candidacy ===
On December 20, 2022, Afroman announced his candidacy in the 2024 presidential election. His campaign manager, Jason Savage, announced his candidacy on his behalf, citing inflation, the housing market, law enforcement corruption, and legalizing marijuana as key issues of his campaign.

<doc id="314509" wikidata="Q333207" url="?curid=314509" title="Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough">
<text>Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough, (8 September 1790 – 22 December 1871), was a British Tory politician. He was four times President of the Board of Control and also served as Governor-General of India between 1842 and 1844.

==Background and education==
Ellenborough was the eldest son of Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough, and Anne Towry, daughter of George Towry. He was educated at Eton College and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1812, he became Chief Clerk of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench (his father&#x27;s court), a sinecure which was worth nearly £8,000 a year. Owing to the political embarrassment it caused, it was commuted for a life pension in 1838.

==Political career, 1813–1842==
Ellenborough represented the subsequently disfranchised rotten borough of St Michael&#x27;s, Cornwall, in the House of Commons, until the death of his father in 1818 gave him a seat in the House of Lords. In the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s government of 1828, Ellenborough was made Lord Privy Seal; he also took part in the business of the foreign office, as an unofficial assistant to Wellington, who recognised his talents. He hoped to be Foreign Secretary, but had to be content with the presidency of the Board of Control, which he retained until the fall of the ministry in 1830. Ellenborough was an active administrator, and took a lively interest in questions of Indian policy. The revision of the East India Company&#x27;s charter was approaching, and he held that the government of India should be transferred directly to the crown. He was impressed with the growing importance of a knowledge of central Asia, in the event of a Russian advance towards the Indian frontier, and despatched Alexander Burnes to explore the district.

Ellenborough subsequently returned to the Board of Control in Robert Peel&#x27;s first and second administrations. He had only held office for a month on the third occasion when he was appointed by the court of directors to succeed Lord Auckland as Governor-General of India.

==Governor-General of India, 1842–1844==
His Indian administration of two and a half years, or half the usual term of service, was from first to last a subject of hostile criticism. His own letters sent monthly to the Queen, and his correspondence with the Duke of Wellington, published in 1874, afford material for an intelligent and impartial judgment of his meteoric career. The events chiefly in dispute are his policy towards Afghanistan and the army and captives there, his conquest of Sind, and his campaign in Gwalior.

Ellenborough went to India to &quot;restore peace to Asia&quot; but the whole term of his office was occupied by war. On his arrival there the news that greeted him was that of the massacre of Kabul, and the sieges of Ghazni and Jalalabad, while the sepoys of Madras were on the verge of open rebellion. In his proclamation of 15 March 1842, as in his memorandum for the queen, dated the 18th, he stated with characteristic clearness and eloquence the duty of first inflicting some signal and decisive blow on the Afghans, and then leaving them to govern themselves under the sovereign of their own choice. Unhappily, when he left for upper India and learned of the failure of General England, he instructed George Pollock and William Nott, who were advancing triumphantly with their avenging columns to rescue the British captives, to fall back. The army proved true to the governor-general&#x27;s earlier proclamation rather than to his later fears; the hostages were rescued and the scene of Sir Alexander Burnes&#x27;s murder in the heart of Kabul was burned down.

Dost Mahommed Khan was quietly released from a prison in Calcutta to the throne in the Bala Hissar, and Ellenborough presided over the painting of the elephants for an unprecedented military spectacle at Ferozepur, on the south bank of the Satluj. When Mahmud of Ghazni, in 1024, sacked the Hindu temple of Somnath on the north-west coast of India, he carried off the richly-studded sandalwood gates of the fanes and set them up in his capital of Ghazni. The Muslim puppet of the English, Shah Shuja, had been asked, when ruler of Afghanistan, to restore them to India; and what he had failed to do the Christian ruler of opposing Muslim and Hindus resolved to effect in the most solemn and public manner. In vain had Major (afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson proved that they were only reproductions of the original gates, to which the Ghazni moulvies clung merely as a source of offerings from the faithful who visited the old conqueror&#x27;s tomb. In vain did the Hindu sepoys show the most chilling indifference to the belauded restoration. Ellenborough could not resist the temptation to copy Napoleon&#x27;s magniloquent proclamation under the pyramids. The fraudulent folding doors were conveyed on a triumphal car to the fort of Agra, where they were found to be made not of sandalwood but of deal. That Somnath proclamation (immortalized in a speech by Macaulay) was the first step towards its author&#x27;s recall.

Hardly had Ellenborough issued his medal with the legend &quot;Pax Asiae Restituta&quot; when he was at war with the amirs of Sind. The tributary amirs had on the whole been faithful, for Major James Outram controlled them. He reported some opposition, and Ellenborough ordered an inquiry, but entrusted the duty to Sir Charles Napier, with full political as well as military powers. Mir Au Morad was intrigued with both sides so effectually that he betrayed the amirs on the one hand, while he deluded Napier on the other. Ellenborough was led on till events were beyond his control, and his own instructions were forgotten. Sir Charles Napier made more than one confession like this: &quot;We have no right to seize Sind, yet we shall do so, and a very advantageous, useful and humane piece of rascality it will be.&quot; The battles of Meeanee and Hyderabad followed; and the Indus became a British river from Karachi to Multan.

Sind had hardly been disposed of when troubles arose on both sides of the governor-general, who was then at Agra. On the north, the disordered kingdom of the Sikhs was threatening the frontier. In Gwalior to the south, the feudatory Mahratta state, there were a large rebellious army, a Ranee only twelve years of age, an adopted chief of eight, and factions in the council of ministers. These conditions brought Gwalior to the verge of civil war. Ellenborough reviewed the danger in the minute of 1 November 1845, and told Sir Hugh Gough to advance. Further treachery and military licence rendered the battles of Maharajpur and Punniar (fought on the same day), inevitable though they were, a surprise to the combatants. The treaty that followed was as merciful as it was wise. The pacification of Gwalior also had its effect beyond the Sutlej, where anarchy was restrained for yet another year, and the work of civilisation was left to Ellenborough&#x27;s two successors. But by this time the patience of the directors was exhausted. They had no control over Ellenborough&#x27;s policy; his despatches to them were haughty and disrespectful; and in June 1844 they exercised their power of recalling him.

==Political career, 1844–1858==
On his return to England, Ellenborough was created Earl of Ellenborough, in the county of Cumberland, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath and received the thanks of Parliament; but his administration soon became the theme of hostile debates, though it was successfully vindicated by Peel and Wellington. When Peel&#x27;s cabinet was reconstituted in 1846 Ellenborough became First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1858 he took office under Lord Derby as president of the board of control, for the fourth time. It was then his congenial task to draft the new scheme for the government of India which the Indian Rebellion of 1857 had rendered necessary. But his old fault of impetuosity again proved his stumbling block. He wrote a caustic despatch censuring Lord Canning for the Oudh proclamation, and allowed it to be published in &quot;The Times&quot; without consulting his colleagues, who disavowed his action in this respect. General disapprobation was excited; votes of censure were announced in both Houses; and, to save the cabinet, Ellenborough resigned.

But for this act of rashness, he might have enjoyed the task of carrying into effect the home constitution for the government of India which he sketched in his evidence before the select committee of the House of Commons on Indian territories on 8 June 1852. Paying off his old score against the East India Company, he then advocated the abolition of the court of directors as a governing body, the opening of the civil service to the army, the transference of the government to the crown, and the appointment of a council to advise the minister who should take the place of the President of the Board of Control. These suggestions of 1852 were carried out by his successor Lord Stanley, in 1858, so closely even in details, that Lord Ellenborough must be pronounced the author, for good or evil, of the system of direct rule of India that was introduced at that time. Though acknowledged to be one of the foremost orators in the House of Lords, and taking a frequent part in debate, Ellenborough never held office again.

See &quot;History of the Indian Administration&quot; (Bentley, 1874), edited by Lord Colchester; &quot;Minutes of Evidence taken before the Select Committee on Indian Territories&quot; (June 1852); volume i. of the &quot;Calcutta Review&quot;; the &quot;Friend of India&quot;, during the years 1842–1845; and John Hope, &quot;The House of Scindea: A Sketch&quot; (Longmans, 1863). The numerous books by and against Sir Charles Napier, on the conquest of Sind, should be consulted.

==Family==
Lord Ellenborough was married twice. He married firstly Lady Octavia Catherine, daughter of Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry, in 1813. They had no children. She died of tuberculosis in March 1819.

He married secondly Jane Digby, daughter of Admiral Sir Henry Digby. They had one child, the Hon. Arthur Dudley Law (15 February 1828 – 1 February 1830). Arthur&#x27;s biological father was Jane&#x27;s cousin; after her cousin ended their affair, she had at least two more affairs. After the news of her affair with Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg became public, Lord and Lady Ellenborough were divorced by Act of Parliament in 1830.

He did not remarry, although he had illegitimate children with his mistress. The stage actor St. Clair Bayfield (born John St. Clair Roberts) was his grandson through his illegitimate daughter, Ida Roberts.

==Death==
Ellenborough died at his seat, Southam House, near Cheltenham, in December 1871, aged 81. On his death, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony by his nephew, Charles Towry-Law, 3rd Baron Ellenborough. He was buried in the family mausoleum at Oxenton Church.

<doc id="314510" wikidata="Q496689" url="?curid=314510" title="Dire wolf">
<text>The dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus ) is an extinct canine. The dire wolf lived in the Americas during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene epochs (125,000–9,500 years ago). A putative, controversial fossil was recently reported from northeast China, but other researchers questioned the taxonomic attribution of this specimen. The species was named in 1858, four years after the first specimen had been found. Two subspecies are recognized: &quot;Aenocyon dirus guildayi&quot; and &quot;Aenocyon dirus dirus&quot;. The largest collection of its fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.

Dire wolf remains have been found across a broad range of habitats including the plains, grasslands, and some forested mountain areas of North America and the arid savanna of South America. The sites range in elevation from sea level to . Dire wolf fossils have rarely been found north of 42°N latitude; there have been only five unconfirmed reports above this latitude. This range restriction is thought to be due to temperature, prey, or habitat limitations imposed by proximity to the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that existed at the time.

The dire wolf was about the same size as the largest modern gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;): the Yukon wolf and the northwestern wolf. &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; weighed on average and &quot;A.d.dirus&quot; was on average . Its skull and dentition matched those of &quot;C.lupus&quot;, but its teeth were larger with greater shearing ability, and its bite force at the canine tooth was stronger than any known &quot;Canis&quot; species. These characteristics are thought to be adaptations for preying on Late Pleistocene megaherbivores, and in North America, its prey is known to have included western horses, ground sloths, mastodons, ancient bison, and camels. Its extinction occurred during the Quaternary extinction event along with its main prey species. Its reliance on megaherbivores has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climatic change and competition with other species, or a combination of those factors. Dire wolves lived as recently as 9,500 years ago, according to dated remains.

==Taxonomy==

From the 1850s, the fossil remains of extinct large wolves were being found in the United States, and it was not immediately clear that these all belonged to one species. The first specimen of what would later become associated with &quot;Aenocyon dirus&quot; was found in mid-1854 in the bed of the Ohio River near Evansville, Indiana. The fossilized jawbone with cheek teeth was obtained by the geologist Joseph Granville Norwood from an Evansville collector, Francis A. Linck. The paleontologist Joseph Leidy determined that the specimen represented an extinct species of wolf and reported it under the name of &quot;Canis primaevus&quot;. Norwood&#x27;s letters to Leidy are preserved along with the type specimen (the first of a species that has a written description) at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In 1857, while exploring the Niobrara River valley in Nebraska, Leidy found the vertebrae of an extinct &quot;Canis&quot; species that he reported the following year under the name &quot;C.dirus&quot;. The name &quot;C.primaevus&quot; (Leidy 1854) was later renamed &quot;Canis indianensis&quot; (Leidy 1869) when Leidy found out that the name &quot;C.primaevus&quot; had previously been used by the British naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson for the dhole.
In 1876 the zoologist Joel Asaph Allen discovered the remains of &quot;Canis mississippiensis&quot; (Allen 1876) and associated these with &quot;C.dirus&quot; (Leidy 1858) and &quot;Canis indianensis&quot; (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 he had found a skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name &quot;C.dirus&quot; (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy&#x27;s 1858 specimen, &quot;C.dirus&quot;. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared &quot;C.indianensis&quot; a synonym of &quot;C.dirus&quot;. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus &quot;Aenocyon&quot; (from &quot;ainos&quot;, &#x27;terrible&#x27; and &quot;cyon&quot;, &#x27;dog&#x27;) to become &quot;Aenocyon dirus&quot;, but at that time not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus &quot;Canis&quot;. &quot;Canis ayersi&quot; (Sellards 1916) and &quot;Aenocyon dirus&quot; (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of &quot;C.dirus&quot; by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of &quot;C.dirus&quot; in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.

In 1984 a study by Björn Kurtén recognized a geographic variation within the dire wolf populations and proposed two subspecies: &quot;Canis dirus guildayi&quot; (named by Kurtén in honor of the paleontologist John E. Guilday) for specimens from California and Mexico that exhibited shorter limbs and longer teeth, and &quot;Canis dirus dirus&quot; for specimens east of the North American Continental Divide that exhibited longer limbs and shorter teeth. Kurtén designated a maxilla found in Hermit&#x27;s Cave, New Mexico as representing the nominate subspecies &quot;C. d. dirus&quot;.

In 2021, a DNA study found the dire wolf to be a highly divergent lineage when compared with the extant wolf-like canines, and this finding is consistent with the previously proposed taxonomic classification of the dire wolf as genus &quot;Aenocyon&quot; (Ancient Greek: &quot;terrible wolf&quot;) as proposed by Merriam in 1918.

===Evolution===
In North America, the canid family came into existence 40 million years ago, and the canine subfamily Caninae about 32 million years ago. From the Caninae, the ancestors of the fox-like Vulpini and the dog-like Canini came into existence 9 million years ago. This group was first represented by &quot;Eucyon&quot;, and mostly by coyote-like &quot;Eucyon davisi&quot; that was spread widely across North America. From the Canini the Cerdocyonina, today represented by the South American canids, came into existence 6–5 million years ago. Its sister the wolf-like Canina came into existence 5 million years ago, however, they are likely to have originated as far back as 9 million years ago. Around 7 million years ago, the canines expanded into Eurasia and Africa, with &quot;Eucyon&quot; giving rise to the first of the genus &quot;Canis&quot; in Europe. Around 4–3 million years ago &quot;C. chihliensis&quot;, the first wolf-sized member of &quot;Canis&quot;, arose in China and expanded to give rise to other wolf-like members across Eurasia and Africa. Members of the genus &quot;Canis&quot; would later expand into North America.

The dire wolf evolved in North America. However, its ancestral lineage is debated, with two competing theories. The first theory is based on fossil morphology, which indicates that an expansion of the genus &quot;Canis&quot; out of Eurasia led to the dire wolf. The second theory is based on DNA evidence, which indicates that the dire wolf arose from an ancestral lineage that originated in the Americas and was separate from the genus &quot;Canis&quot;.

====Morphological evidence====


Morphological evidence based on fossil remains indicates an expansion of genus &quot;Canis&quot; from out of Eurasia led to the dire wolf.

In 1974 Robert A. Martin proposed that the large North American wolf &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; (Armbruster&#x27;s wolf) was &quot;C. lupus&quot;. Nowak, Kurtén, and Annalisa Berta proposed that &quot;C. dirus&quot; was not derived from &quot;C. lupus&quot;. In 1987, a new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could give rise to a larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant, but when food later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and speciationa process by which a new species splits from an older onecould occur together during periods of climatic extremes. Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin, proposing further that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of &quot;C. dirus&quot; in North America and, judging from the similarities in their skull shapes, that &quot;C. lupus&quot; had given rise to the &quot;C. dirus&quot; hypermorph due to an abundance of game, a stable environment, and large competitors.

The three paleontologists Xiaoming Wang, Richard H. Tedford, and Ronald M. Nowak propose that &quot;C. dirus&quot; evolved from &quot;Canis armbrusteri&quot;, with Nowak stating that both species arose in the Americas and that specimens found in Cumberland Cave, Maryland, appear to be &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; diverging into &quot;C. dirus&quot;. Nowak believed that &quot;Canis edwardii&quot; was the first appearance of the wolf in North America, and it appears to be close to the lineage which produced &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; and &quot;C. dirus&quot;. Tedford believes that the early wolf from China, &quot;Canis chihliensis&quot;, may have been the ancestor of both &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; and the gray wolf &quot;C. lupus&quot;. The sudden appearance of &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; in mid-latitude North America during the Early Pleistocene 1.5 million years ago, along with the mammoth, suggests that it was an immigrant from Asia, with the gray wolf &quot;C. lupus&quot; evolving in Beringia later in the Pleistocene and entering mid-latitude North America during the Last Glacial Period along with its Beringian prey. In 2010 Francisco Prevosti proposed that &quot;C. dirus&quot; was a sister taxon to &quot;C. lupus&quot;.
&quot;C. dirus&quot; lived in the Late Pleistocene to the early Holocene, 125,000–10,000 YBP (years before present), in North and South America. The majority of fossils from the eastern &quot;C. d. dirus&quot; have been dated 125,000–75,000 YBP, but the western fossils are not only smaller in size but more recent; thus it has been proposed that derived from However, there are disputed specimens of &quot;C. dirus&quot; that date to 250,000 YBP. Fossil specimens of &quot;C. dirus&quot; discovered at four sites in the Hay Springs area of Sheridan County, Nebraska, were named &quot;Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis&quot; (Frick 1930, undescribed), but Frick did not publish a description of them. Nowak later referred to this material as &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot;; then, in 2009, Tedford formally published a description of the specimens and noted that, although they exhibited some morphological characteristics of both &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; and &quot;C. dirus&quot;, he referred to them only as &quot;C. dirus&quot;.

A fossil discovered in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota may possibly be &quot;C. dirus&quot;; if so, this fossil is one of the earliest specimens on record. It was catalogued as &quot;Canis cf. C. dirus&quot; (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain). The fossil of a horse found in the Horse Room provided a uranium-series dating of 252,000 YBP and the &quot;Canis cf. dirus&quot; specimen was assumed to be from the same period. &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; and &quot;C. dirus&quot; share some characteristics (synapomorphies) that imply the latter&#x27;s descent from the former. The fossil record suggests &quot;C. dirus&quot; originated around 250,000 YBP in the open terrain of the mid-continent before expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot;. The first appearance of &quot;C. dirus&quot; would therefore be 250,000 YBP in California and Nebraska, and later in the rest of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, but the identity of these earliest fossils is not confirmed.

In South America, &quot;C. dirus&quot; specimens dated to the Late Pleistocene were found along the north and west coasts, but none have been found in Argentina, an area that was inhabited by &quot;Canis gezi&quot; and &quot;Canis nehringi&quot;. Given their similarities and timeframes, it is proposed that &quot;C. gezi&quot; was the ancestor of &quot;Canis nehringi&quot;. One study found that &quot;C. dirus&quot; was more evolutionarily derived compared with &quot;C. nehringi&quot;, and was larger in the size and construction of its lower molars for more efficient predation. For this reason, some researchers have proposed that &quot;C. dirus&quot; may have originated in South America. Tedford proposed that &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; was the common ancestor for both the North and South American wolves. Later studies concluded that &quot;C. dirus&quot; and &quot;C. nehringi&quot; were the same species, and that &quot;C. dirus&quot; had migrated from North America into South America, making it a participant in the Great American Interchange. In 2018, a study found that &quot;Canis gezi&quot; did not fall under genus &quot;Canis&quot; and should be classified under the subtribe Cerdocyonina, however no genus was proposed.

The 2020 discovery of a claimed dire wolf fossil in northeast China indicates that dire wolves may have crossed Beringia when it existed, though other researchers doubt that this specimen represents a dire wolf.

====DNA evidence====
DNA evidence indicates the dire wolf arose from an ancestral lineage that originated in the Americas and was separate to genus &quot;Canis&quot;.

In 1992 an attempt was made to extract a mitochondrial DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; to compare its relationship to other &quot;Canis&quot; species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains had been removed from the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.

In 2021, researchers sequenced the nuclear DNA (from the cell nucleus) taken from five dire wolf fossils dating from 13,000 to 50,000 years ago. The sequences indicate the dire wolf to be a highly divergent lineage which last shared a most recent common ancestor with the wolf-like canines 5.7 million years ago. The study also measured numerous dire wolf and gray wolf skeletal samples that showed their morphologies to be highly similar, which had led to the theory that the dire wolf and the gray wolf had a close evolutionary relationship. The morphological similarity between dire wolves and gray wolves was concluded to be due to convergent evolution. Members of the wolf-like canines are known to hybridize with each other but the study could find no indication of genetic admixture from the five dire wolf samples with extant North American gray wolves and coyotes nor their common ancestor. This finding indicates that the wolf and coyote lineages evolved in isolation from the dire wolf lineage.

The study proposes an early origin of the dire wolf lineage in the Americas, and that this geographic isolation allowed them to develop a degree of reproductive isolation since their divergence 5.7 million years ago. Coyotes, dholes, gray wolves, and the extinct &quot;Xenocyon&quot; evolved in Eurasia and expanded into North America relatively recently during the Late Pleistocene, therefore there was no admixture with the dire wolf. The long-term isolation of the dire wolf lineage implies that other American fossil taxa, including &quot;C. armbrusteri&quot; and &quot;C. edwardii&quot;, may also belong to the dire wolf&#x27;s lineage. The study&#x27;s findings are consistent with the previously proposed taxonomic classification of the dire wolf as genus &quot;Aenocyon&quot;.

===Radiocarbon dating===
The age of most dire wolf localities is determined solely by biostratigraphy, but biostratigraphy is an unreliable indicator within asphalt deposits. Some sites have been radiocarbon dated, with dire wolf specimens from the LaBrea pits dated in calendar years as follows: 82 specimens dated 13,000–14,000YBP; 40 specimens dated 14,000–16,000YBP; 77 specimens dated 14,000–18,000YBP; 37 specimens dated 17,000–18,000YBP; 26 specimens dated 21,000–30,000YBP; 40 specimens dated 25,000–28,000YBP; and 6specimens dated 32,000–37,000YBP. A specimen from Powder Mill Creek Cave, Missouri, was dated at 13,170YBP.

==Description==

The average dire wolf proportions were similar to those of two modern North American wolves: the Yukon wolf (&quot;Canis lupus pambasileus&quot;) and the Northwestern wolf (&quot;Canis lupus occidentalis&quot;). The largest northern wolves today have a shoulder height of up to and a body length of . Some dire wolf specimens from Rancho LaBrea are smaller than this, and some are larger.

The dire wolf had smaller feet and a larger head when compared with a northern wolf of the same body size. The skull length could reach up to or longer, with a broader palate, frontal region, and zygomatic arches compared with the Yukon wolf. These dimensions make the skull very massive. Its sagittal crest was higher, with the inion showing a significant backward projection, and with the rear ends of the nasal bones extending relatively far back into the skull. A connected skeleton of a dire wolf from Rancho LaBrea is difficult to find because the tar allows the bones to disassemble in many directions. Parts of a vertebral column have been assembled, and it was found to be similar to that of the modern wolf, with the same number of vertebrae.

Geographic differences in dire wolves were not detected until 1984, when a study of skeletal remains showed differences in a few cranio-dental features and limb proportions between specimens from California and Mexico (&quot;A.d.guildayi&quot;) and those found from the east of the Continental Divide (&quot;A.d.dirus&quot;). A comparison of limb size shows that the rear limbs of &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; were 8% shorter than the Yukon wolf due to a significantly shorter tibia and metatarsus, and that the front limbs were also shorter due to their slightly shorter lower bones. With its comparatively lighter and smaller limbs and massive head, &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; was not as well adapted for running as timber wolves and coyotes. &quot;A.d.dirus&quot; possessed significantly longer limbs than &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot;. The forelimbs were 14% longer than &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; due to 10% longer humeri, 15% longer radii, and 15% longer metacarpals. The rear limbs were 10% longer than &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; due to 10% longer femora and tibiae, and 15% longer metatarsals. &quot;A.d.dirus&quot; is comparable to the Yukon wolf in limb length. The largest &quot;A.d.dirus&quot; femur was found in Carroll Cave, Missouri, and measured .

&quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; is estimated to have weighed on average , and &quot;A.d.dirus&quot; weighed on average with some specimens being larger, but these could not have exceeded due to skeletal limits. In comparison, the average weight of the Yukon wolf is for males and for females. Individual weights for Yukon wolves can vary from to , with one Yukon wolf weighing . These figures show the average dire wolf to be similar in size to the largest modern gray wolf.

The remains of a complete male &quot;A. dirus&quot; are sometimes easy to identify compared to other &quot;Canis&quot; specimens because the baculum (penis bone) of the dire wolf is very different from that of all other living canids. A 2024 study found the baculum of a male dire wolf to be proportionally longer than the baculum of modern canids, which may be indicative of stronger competition between males and unusual behaviors among canids including non-monogamous mating.

==Adaptation==
Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition have been shown to greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size of its body have been correlated with climate fluctuations.

===Paleoecology===
The last glacial period, commonly referred to as the &quot;Ice Age&quot;, spanned 125,000–14,500YBP and was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age, which occurred during the last years of the Pleistocene era. The Ice Age reached its peak during the Last Glacial Maximum, when ice sheets began advancing from 33,000YBP and reached their maximum limits 26,500YBP. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000YBP and in Antarctica approximately 14,500YBP, which is consistent with evidence that glacial meltwater was the primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level 14,500YBP. Access into northern North America was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The fossil evidence from the Americas points to the extinction mainly of large animals, termed Pleistocene megafauna, near the end of the last glaciation.

Coastal southern California from 60,000YBP to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum was cooler and with a more balanced supply of moisture than today. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the mean annual temperature decreased from down to degrees, and annual precipitation had decreased from down to . This region was unaffected by the climatic effects of the Wisconsin glaciation and is thought to have been an Ice Age refugium for animals and cold-sensitive plants. By 24,000YBP, the abundance of oak and chaparral decreased, but pines increased, creating open parklands similar to today&#x27;s coastal montane/juniper woodlands. After 14,000YBP, the abundance of conifers decreased, and those of the modern coastal plant communities, including oak woodland, chaparral, and coastal sage scrub, increased. The Santa Monica Plain lies north of the city of Santa Monica and extends along the southern base of the Santa Monica Mountains, and 28,000–26,000YBP it was dominated by coastal sage scrub, with cypress and pines at higher elevations. The Santa Monica Mountains supported a chaparral community on its slopes and isolated coast redwood and dogwood in its protected canyons, along with river communities that included willow, red cedar, and sycamore. These plant communities suggest a winter rainfall similar to that of modern coastal southern California, but the presence of coast redwood now found to the north indicates a cooler, moister, and less seasonal climate than today. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for dire wolves and their competitors.

===Prey===

A range of animal and plant specimens that became entrapped and were then preserved in tar pits have been removed and studied so that researchers can learn about the past. The Rancho LaBrea tar pits located near Los Angeles in Southern California are a collection of pits of sticky asphalt deposits that differ in deposition time from 40,000 to 12,000YBP. Commencing 40,000YBP, trapped asphalt has been moved through fissures to the surface by methane pressure, forming seeps that can cover several square meters and be deep. A large number of dire wolf fossils have been recovered from the La Brea tar pits. Over 200,000 specimens (mostly fragments) have been recovered from the tar pits, with the remains ranging from &quot;Smilodon&quot; to squirrels, invertebrates, and plants. The time period represented in the pits includes the Last Glacial Maximum when global temperatures were lower than today, the Pleistocene–Holocene transition (Bølling-Allerød interval), the Oldest Dryas cooling, the Younger Dryas cooling from 12,800 to 11,500YBP, and the American megafaunal extinction event 12,700YBP when 90 genera of mammals weighing over became extinct.

Isotope analysis can be used to identify some chemical elements, allowing researchers to make inferences about the diet of the species found in the pits. Isotope analysis of bone collagen extracted from LaBrea specimens provides evidence that the dire wolf, &quot;Smilodon&quot;, and the American lion (&quot;Panthera atrox&quot;) competed for the same prey. Their prey included the extinct camel &quot;Camelops hesternus&quot;, the extinct bison &quot;Bison antiquus&quot;, the &quot;dwarf&quot; pronghorn (&quot;Capromeryx minor&quot;), the equine &quot;Equus occidentalis&quot;, and Harlan&#x27;s ground sloth (&quot;Paramylodon harlani&quot;) native to North American grasslands. The Columbian mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus columbi&quot;) and the American mastodon (&quot;Mammut americanum&quot;) were rare at LaBrea. The horses remained mixed feeders and the pronghorns mixed browsers, but at the Last Glacial Maximum and its associated shift in vegetation the camels and bison were forced to rely more heavily on conifers.

A study of isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP provides evidence that the horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and at the close of the Late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores. A study based on specimens found in Cedral, San Luis Potosi found that the dire wolf primarily preyed on herbivores that consumed C4 plants and on mixed-diet herbivores.

===Dentition and bite force===
When compared with the dentition of genus &quot;Canis&quot; members, the dire wolf was considered the most evolutionary derived (advanced) wolf-like species in the Americas. The dire wolf could be identified separately from all other &quot;Canis&quot; species by its possession of: &quot;P2 with a posterior cusplet; P3 with two posterior cusplets; M1 with a mestascylid, entocristed, entoconulid, and a transverse crest extending from the metaconid to the hyperconular shelf; M2 with entocristed and entoconulid.&quot;

A study of the estimated bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator&#x27;s largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf was similar to that of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.
A study of the cranial measurements and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger than those of the gray wolf, and the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the gray wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.

===Behavior===
At La Brea, predatory birds and mammals were attracted to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of herbivore remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; is the most common carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by &quot;Smilodon&quot;. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did not reflect the wider area. Assuming that only a few of the carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.

The difference between the male and female of a species apart from their sex organs is called sexual dimorphism, and in this regard little variance exists among the canids. A study of dire wolf remains dated 15,360–14,310YBP and taken from one pit that focused on skull length, canine tooth size, and lower molar length showed little dimorphism, similar to that of the gray wolf, indicating that dire wolves lived in monogamous pairs. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition supports the proposal that the dire wolf was a predator that fed on large prey. To kill ungulates larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they work together as a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. It can be assumed that dire wolves lived in packs of relatives that were led by an alpha pair. Large and social carnivores would have been successful at defending carcasses of prey trapped in the tar pits from smaller solitary predators, and thus the most likely to become trapped themselves. The many &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot; and &quot;Smilodon&quot; remains found in the tar pits suggests that both were social predators.

All social terrestrial mammalian predators prey mostly on terrestrial herbivorous mammals with a body mass similar to the combined mass of the social group members attacking the prey animal. The large size of the dire wolf provides an estimated prey size in the range. Stable isotope analysis of dire wolf bones provides evidence that they had a preference for consuming ruminants such as bison rather than other herbivores but moved to other prey when food became scarce, and occasionally scavenged on beached whales along the Pacific coast when available. A pack of timber wolves can bring down a moose that is their preferred prey, and a pack of dire wolves bringing down a bison is conceivable. Although some studies have suggested that because of tooth breakage, the dire wolf must have gnawed bones and may have been a scavenger, its widespread occurrence and the more gracile limbs of the dire wolf indicate a predator. Like the gray wolf today, the dire wolf probably used its post-carnassial molars to gain access to marrow, but the dire wolf&#x27;s larger size enabled it to crack larger bones.

====Tooth breakage====
Tooth breakage is related to a carnivore&#x27;s behavior. A study of nine modern carnivores found that one in four adults had suffered tooth breakage and that half of these breakages were of the canine teeth. The most breakage occurred in the spotted hyena that consumes all of its prey including the bone; the least breakage occurred in the African wild dog, and the gray wolf ranked in between these two. The eating of bone increases the risk of accidental fracture due to the relatively high, unpredictable stresses that it creates. The most commonly broken teeth are the canines, followed by the premolars, carnassial molars, and incisors. Canines are the teeth most likely to break because of their shape and function, which subjects them to bending stresses that are unpredictable in both direction and magnitude. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when killing large prey.

A study of the fossil remains of large carnivores from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and &quot;Smilodon&quot;, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth were the same as in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).

A later La Brea pits study compared tooth breakage of dire wolves in two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. The results showed that the 15,000YBP dire wolves had three times more tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000 and 14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.

Carnivores include both pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter depends on a powerful bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular symphysis. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use the strength of the mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to enable the animals to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of the dire wolf was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the African hunting dog. The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of the dire wolf indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and was therefore a pack hunter. This suggests that the dire wolf may have processed bone but was not as well adapted for it as was the gray wolf. The fact that the incidence of fracture for the dire wolf reduced in frequency in the Late Pleistocene to that of its modern relatives suggests that reduced competition had allowed the dire wolf to return to a feeding behavior involving a lower amount of bone consumption, a behavior for which it was best suited.

The results of a study of dental microwear on tooth enamel for specimens of the carnivore species from LaBrea pits, including dire wolves, suggest that these carnivores were not food-stressed just before their extinction. The evidence also indicated that the extent of carcass utilization (i.e., amount consumed relative to the maximum amount possible to consume, including breakup and consumption of bones) was less than among large carnivores today. These findings indicates that tooth breakage was related to hunting behavior and the size of prey.

===Climate impact===
Past studies proposed that changes in dire wolf body size correlated with climate fluctuations. A later study compared dire wolf craniodental morphology from four LaBrea pits, each representing four different time periods. The results are evidence of a change in dire wolf size, dental wear and breakage, skull shape, and snout shape across time. Dire wolf body size had decreased between the start of the Last Glacial Maximum and near its ending at the warm Allerød oscillation. Evidence of food stress (food scarcity leading to lower nutrient intake) is seen in smaller body size, skulls with a larger cranial base, and shorter snout (shape neoteny and size neoteny), and more tooth breakage and wear. Dire wolves dated 17,900YBP showed all of these features, which indicates food stress. Dire wolves dated 28,000YBP also showed to a degree many of these features but were the largest wolves studied, and it was proposed that these wolves were also suffering from food stress and that wolves earlier than this date were even bigger in size. Nutrient stress is likely to lead to stronger bite forces to more fully consume carcasses and to crack bones, and with changes to skull shape to improve mechanical advantage. North American climate records reveal cyclic fluctuations during the glacial period that included rapid warming followed by gradual cooling, called Dansgaard–Oeschger events. These cycles would have caused increased temperature and aridity, and at LaBrea would have caused ecological stress and therefore food stress. A similar trend was found with the gray wolf, which in the Santa Barbara basin was originally massive, robust, and possibly convergent evolution with the dire wolf, but was replaced by more gracile forms by the start of the Holocene.

===Competitors===

Just before the appearance of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the &quot;Canis&quot; subgenus &quot;Xenocyon&quot; (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the African hunting dog) that was as large as the dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, &quot;Smilodon&quot;, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (&quot;Arctodus simus&quot;), the modern cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), the Pleistocene coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.

Specimens that have been identified by morphology as Beringian wolves (&quot;C.lupus&quot;) and radiocarbon dated 25,800–14,300 YBP have been found in the Natural Trap Cave at the base of the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, in the western United States. The location is directly south of what would at that time have been a division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. A temporary channel between the glaciers may have existed that allowed these large, Alaskan direct competitors of the dire wolf, which were also adapted for preying on megafauna, to come south of the ice sheets. Dire wolf remains are absent north of the 42°Nlatitude in North America, therefore, this region would have been available for Beringian wolves to expand south along the glacier line. How widely they were then distributed is not known. These also became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene, as did the dire wolf.

After arriving in eastern Eurasia, the dire wolf would have likely faced competition from the area&#x27;s most dominant, widespread predator, the eastern subspecies of cave hyena (&quot;Crocuta crocuta ultima&quot;). Competition with this species may have kept Eurasian dire wolf populations very low, leading to the paucity of dire wolf fossil remains in this otherwise well-studied fossil fauna.

==Range==

Dire wolf remains have been found across a broad range of habitats including the plains, grasslands, and some forested mountain areas of North America, the arid savannah of South America, and possibly the steppes of eastern Asia. The sites range in elevation from sea level to . The location of these fossil remains suggests that dire wolves lived predominantly in the open lowlands along with their prey the large herbivores. Dire wolf remains are not often found at high latitudes in North America, with the northernmost record in southern Canada.

In the United States, dire wolf fossils have been reported in Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Nevada. The identity of fossils reported farther north than California is not confirmed. There have been five reports of unconfirmed dire wolf fossils north of 42°Nlatitude at Fossil Lake, Oregon (125,000–10,000YBP), American Falls Reservoir, Idaho (125,000–75,000YBP), Salamander Cave, South Dakota (250,000YBP), and four closely grouped sites in northern Nebraska (250,000YBP). This suggests a range restriction on dire wolves due to temperature, prey, or habitat. The major fossil-producing sites for &quot;A.d.dirus&quot; are located east of the Rocky Mountains and include Friesenhahn Cave, near San Antonio, Texas; Carroll Cave, near Richland, Missouri; and Reddick, Florida.
Localities in Mexico where dire wolf remains have been collected include ElCedazo in Aguascalientes, Comondú Municipality in Baja California Sur, ElCedral in San Luis Potosí, ElTajo Quarry near Tequixquiac, state of Mexico, Valsequillo in Puebla, Lago de Chapala in Jalisco, Loltun Cave in Yucatán, Potrecito in Sinaloa, San Josecito Cave near Aramberri in Nuevo León and Térapa in Sonora. The specimens from Térapa were confirmed as &quot;A.d.guildayi&quot;. The finds at San Josecito Cave and ElCedazo have the greatest number of individuals from a single locality.

In South America, dire wolves have been dated younger than 17,000 YBP and have been reported from six localities: Muaco in the western Falcón state of Venezuela, Talara Province in Peru, Monagas state in eastern Venezuela, the Tarija Department in Bolivia, Atacama Desert of Chile, and Ecuador. If the dire wolf originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South America because of the favorable cool, dry, and open habitats that characterized the region at times. This most likely happened during a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of tropical rain forest.

In 2020, a fossil mandible (IVPP V25381) later analyzed as a dire wolf&#x27;s was found in the vicinity of Harbin, northeastern China. The fossil was taxonomically described and dated 40,000 YBP. This discovery challenges previous theories that the cold temperatures and ice sheets at northern latitudes in North America would be a barrier for dire wolves, which was based on no dire wolf fossils being found above the 42° latitude in North America. It is proposed that the dire wolf followed migrating prey from mid-latitude North America then across Beringia into Eurasia. However, the 2022 study argued that the morphology and size of the specimen is inconclusive for its taxonomic determination as a dire wolf.

==Extinction==

During the Quaternary extinction event around 12,700YBP, 90genera of mammals weighing over became extinct. The extinction of the large carnivores and scavengers is thought to have been caused by the extinction of the megaherbivore prey upon which they depended. The cause of the extinction of the megafauna is debated but has been attributed to the impact of climatic change, competition with other species including overexploitation by newly arrived human hunters, or a combination of both. One study proposes that several extinction models should be investigated because so little is known about the biogeography of the dire wolf and its potential competitors and prey, nor how all these species interacted and responded to the environmental changes that occurred at the time of extinction.

Ancient DNA and radiocarbon data indicate that local genetic populations were replaced by others within the same species or by others within the same genus. Both the dire wolf and the Beringian wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive, which may have outcompeted the dire wolf. One study proposes an early origin of the dire wolf lineage in the Americas which led to its reproductive isolation, such that when coyotes, dholes, gray wolves, and &quot;Xenocyon&quot; expanded into North America from Eurasia in the Late Pleistocene there could be no admixture with the dire wolf. Gray wolves and coyotes may have survived due to their ability to hybridize with other canids – such as the domestic dog – to acquire traits that resist diseases brought by taxa arriving from Eurasia. Reproductive isolation may have prevented the dire wolf from acquiring these traits. A 2023 study documented a high degree of subchondral defects in joint surfaces of dire wolf and &quot;Smilodon&quot; specimens from the La Brea Tar pits that resembled osteochondrosis dissecans. As modern dogs with this disease are inbred, the researchers suggested this would have been the case for the prehistoric species as well as they approached extinction, but cautioned that more research was needed to determine if this was also the case in specimens from other parts of the Americas.

Dire wolf remains having the youngest geological ages are dated at 9,440YBP at Brynjulfson Cave, Boone County, Missouri, 9,860YBP at Rancho La Brea, California, and 10,690YBP at La Mirada, California. Dire wolf remains have been radiocarbon dated to 8,200YBP from Whitewater Draw in Arizona, though one author has stated that radiocarbon dating of bone carbonate is unreliable. All of these dates are uncalibrated and the actual age of the remains is likely older. In South America, the most recent remains at Talara, Peru date to 9,030 ± 240 YBP (also uncalibrated), while the most recent remains of &quot;C. nehringi&quot; from Luján, Argentina are older than the most recent stratigraphical section of the site, dated to 10–11,000 YBP.

<text>Süpplingenburg is a municipality in the district of Helmstedt, Lower Saxony, Germany. It is part of the collective municipality (&quot;Samtgemeinde&quot;) of Nord-Elm.

The village developed next to a 10th-century water castle at the Schunter river, probably erected by the Counts of Haldensleben who then held the office of margraves of the Northern March. Gertrud von Haldensleben&#x27;s daughter, Hedwig of Formbach, married Count Gebhard of Supplinburg. Until 1173 the castle was the seat of the Counts of Supplinburg, among them Gebhard&#x27;s son Emperor Lothair III of Supplinburg.

Lothair had a collegiate church and cloister built within the Supplinburg palace about 1130. In 1173 his grandson Henry the Lion granted Süpplingenburg to the Knights Templar order, from which it fell to the Knights Hospitaller in 1357. It remained a commandry (&quot;Komturei&quot;) of the Order of Saint John until in 1820 it was finally mediatised to the Duchy of Brunswick. The castle was demolished about 1875, while the St John Church survived, today a stop at the scenic Romanesque Road.
==Transportation==
Süpplingenburg can be reached via the Bundesstraße 1 federal highway at Süpplingen or the Bundesautobahn 2 at the Rennau junction. Train service of the Brunswick-Magdeburg railway line is available at Helmstedt.

<text>Major-General Sir William Nott (20 January 1782 – 1 January 1845) was a British military officer of the Bengal Army, East India Company in British India.

==Early life==
Nott was born in 1782, near Neath in Wales, the second son of Charles Nott, a Herefordshire farmer of Welsh background, who in 1794 became an innkeeper of the Ivy Bush Inn at Carmarthen in Wales. Nott was educated in Neath, and then at Cowbridge Grammar School but left education after his father became an innkeeper. Nott joined the volunteer corps in 1798 and obtained a cadetship in the Indian army and went to India in 1800 when under Company rule in India it was a key component of the growing British Empire.

==Military history==

In 1825, Nott was promoted to the command of his regiment of native infantry; and in 1838, on the outbreak of the First Afghan war, he was appointed to the command of a brigade. From April to October 1839 he was in command of the troops left at Quetta, where he rendered valuable service. In November 1840 he captured Khelat, and in the following year compelled Akbar Khan and other tribal chiefs to submit to the British.

On receiving the news of the rising of the Afghans at Kabul in November 1841, Nott took energetic measures. On 23 December the British envoy, Sir William Hay Macnaghten, was murdered at Kabul; and, in February 1842, the commander-in-chief, General Elphinstone, sent orders that Kandahar was to be evacuated. Nott at once decided to disobey, on the supposition that Elphinstone was not a free agent at Kabul; and as soon as he heard the news of the &quot;Massacre of Elphinstone&#x27;s army&quot;, he urged the government at Calcutta to maintain the garrison of Kandahar with a view to avenging the massacre and the murder of Macnaghten. In March he inflicted a severe defeat on the enemy near Kandahar, and in May drove them with heavy loss out of the Baba Wali Pass.

In July, he received orders from Lord Ellenborough, the Governor-General of India, to evacuate Afghanistan, with permission to retire by Kabul. Nott arranged with Sir George Pollock, now commander-in-chief, to join him at Kabul. On 30 August he routed the Afghans at Ghazni, and on 6 September occupied the fortress, from which he carried away, by the governor-general&#x27;s express instructions, the gates of the temple of Somnath ; on the 17th he joined Pollock at Kabul. The combined army recrossed the Sutlej in December.

==Honours and pension==
Nott&#x27;s services were highly commended; he was immediately appointed Resident at Lucknow, was presented with a Sword of Honour, and was invested as a Knights Grand Cross of the GCB. In 1843 he returned to Britain, where the directors of the East India Company voted him a pension of £1,000 per annum (equivalent to £83,000 pa in 2008).

He died at Carmarthen on 1 January 1845, aged 62.

==Family==
Nott was married twice. Firstly he wed Letitia Swinhoe with whom he had five children, including Charlotte, who married John Bower and was the father of Sir William Nott-Bower.

He married his second, much younger, wife in 1843. She was née Rosa Wilson Dore (died 1901), daughter of Major P. L. Dore. After her husband’s death in 1845, she remarried Thomas Twisden Hodges, MP. When her second husband died in 1865 she resumed the name Lady Nott.

==Statue of General Nott in Carmarthen==
A statue of General Nott was erected in his home town of Carmarthen in 1851. Sculpted by Edward Davis, it now has Grade II Listed status. It was based on a portrait of Nott by the painter Thomas Brigstocke, who was also born in the town. According to the PMSA, &quot;the bronze statue was cast from cannon captured at the Battle of Maharajpur. Queen Victoria gave 200 guineas to the memorial fund. The statue occupies the site of the market cross which was dismantled when the market was resited and Nott Square created in 1846.&quot;

<text>Sir John William Kaye (3 June 1814 – 24 July 1876) was a British military historian, civil servant and army officer in India. His major works on military history include a three-volume work on &quot;The History of the Sepoy War in India&quot;. This work was revised later by George Bruce Malleson and published in six volumes in 1890 as &quot;Kaye and Malleson&#x27;s History of the Indian Mutiny&quot;.

== Biography ==
The second son of Charles Kaye, a solicitor, and Eliza, daughter of Hugh Atkins, he was born in London on 3 June 1814 and baptized on 30 June 1814. He was educated at Eton College (1823–1826) and at the Royal Military College, Addiscombe (1831–1832).

From 1832 to 1841 he was an officer in the Bengal Artillery commissioned on 14 December 1832 as a Second-Lieutenant and on 19 August 1840 promoted to Lieutenant. During his time in the Army he began following literary pursuits both in India and in Britain.

In 1839 he married Mary Catherine (1813–1893), daughter of Thomas Puckle of Surrey. He resigned his commission in the army on 1 April 1841 and began to write for newspapers such as the &quot;Bengal Hurkaru&quot;, which he edited. In 1844 he started the &quot;Calcutta Review&quot; and contributed about 50 articles to it while also writing a novel based in Afghanistan.

In 1845 Kaye returned to England to follow a professional literary career. He worked on his &quot;History of the War in Afghanistan&quot;, an account of the First Anglo-Afghan War. The book was well received: John Clark Marshman regarded it as &quot;the most interesting of all works which have hitherto appeared on British Indian history&quot;.

Kaye entered the Home Civil Service of the East India Company in 1856. As John Stuart Mill was promoted to the post of Examiner of Indian correspondence, Kaye succeeded him as Political Assistant in the Examiner Department at East India House. During this time, he wrote the &quot;History of the Sepoy War in India&quot;, his history of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. It is considered a &quot;well-ordered and comprehensive narrative&quot;. This work was later revised and continued by George Bruce Malleson as &quot;Kaye and Malleson&#x27;s History of the Indian Mutiny&quot; and published in six volumes. It was completed in 1890. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; considers Kaye&#x27;s &quot;History of the Sepoy War in India&quot; still to be a standard work.

When in 1858 the government of India was transferred to the British crown, Kaye succeeded as Secretary in the Political and Secret Department of the Office of the Secretary of State for India. In 1866 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the 1871 Birthday Honours he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI).
After retiring from the India Office in 1874 due to ill health, he died in London at his home at Rose Hill on 24 July 1876. An obituary in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; praised him as a &quot;household word in the East&quot;.

<text>Sir William Hay Macnaghten, 1st Baronet (24 August 179323 December 1841), was a British civil servant in India, who played a major part in the First Anglo-Afghan War.

==Life==
William was the second son of Sir Francis Macnaghten, 1st Baronet, judge of the supreme courts of Madras and Calcutta, and was educated at Charterhouse. He went to Madras as a cadet in 1809, but in 1816 joined the Bengal Civil Service. He displayed a talent for languages and published several treatises on Hindu and Islamic law. His political career began in 1830 as secretary to Lord William Bentinck; and, in 1837, he became one of the most trusted advisers of the governor-general, Lord Auckland, with whose policy of supporting Shah Shujah against Dost Mahommed Khan, the reigning Amir of Kabul, Macnaghten became closely identified.

He was created a baronet in 1840, and four months before his death was nominated to the governorship of Bombay. 

As the British Envoy and Political Agent in Kabul, he came into conflict with the British military authorities and subsequently with his subordinate Sir Alexander Burnes. Macnaghten attempted to placate the Afghan chiefs with heavy subsidies, but when the drain on the Indian exchequer became too great, and the allowances were reduced, this policy precipitated a disastrous collapse in relations between the British and Afghans. Burnes was murdered on 2 November 1841; and under the elderly General William Elphinstone, who was also injured in a bad fall from his horse, the morale and confidence of the British/Indian army in Kabul drastically deteriorated. 
Macnaghten tried to save the situation by negotiating with the Afghan chiefs and, independently of them, with Dost Mahammad&#x27;s son, Wazir Akbar Khan. At a meeting with Wazir Akbar Khan outside Kabul on 23 December 1841, Macnaghten presented Wazir Akbar Khan with a fine pair of pistols as a gesture of friendship and good faith. However, Wazir Akbar Khan murdered Macnaghten on the spot. The exact circumstances of his death are unclear. Wazir Akbar Khan may have killed Macnaghten with one of the very pistols that he had just been gifted by Macnaghten, or Macnaghten may have been killed because he was resisting after being captured and it was feared he would break free. The former account is more likely to be true.

The eviction of the British army soon became an inspirational story among the Afghans, with the disastrous retreat from Kabul and the Massacre of Elphinstone&#x27;s army in the Khurd-Kabul Pass following. The entire calamitous episode cast the gravest doubt on Macnaghten&#x27;s capacity for dealing with the problems of colonial diplomacy.

==Works==

Macnaghten produced one of the principal editions of the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot;, known as the &quot;Calcutta II&quot; edition.

== Appearances in fiction ==

Macnaghten appears in the first volume of the &quot;Flashman Papers&quot;, being depicted as ambitious, arrogant and a .

He also appears in &quot;To Herat and Kabul&quot; by G. A. Henty. He is pictured as a brave man, but clueless about Afghan politics. Henty places the blame for convincing Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India, to place Shuja on the throne squarely on his shoulders.

<text>Ferdinand Marie, Comte de Lesseps (; 19 November 1805 – 7 December 1894) was a French Orientalist diplomat and later developer of the Suez Canal, which in 1869 joined the Mediterranean and Red Seas, substantially reducing sailing distances and times between Europe and East Asia.

He attempted to repeat this success with an effort to build a Panama Canal at sea level during the 1880s, but the project was devastated by epidemics of malaria and yellow fever in the area, as well as beset by financial problems, and the planned Lesseps Panama Canal was never completed. Eventually, the project was bought out by the United States, which solved the medical problems and changed the design to a non-sea level canal with locks. It was completed in 1914.

==Ancestry==
The origins of Lesseps&#x27; family are traceable back as far as the end of the 14th century. His ancestors, it is believed, came from Spain, and settled at Bayonne during the period of the Angevin Empire. One of his great-grandfathers, Pierre de Lesseps (1690–1759), son of Bertrand Lesseps (1649–1708) and wife (m.1675) Louise Fisson (1654–1690), was town clerk and at the same time secretary to Queen Maria Anna of Neuburg, widow of Charles II of Spain.

From the middle of the 18th century the ancestors of Lesseps followed diplomatic careers, and he himself occupied several diplomatic posts from 1825 to 1849. His uncle was ennobled by King Louis XVI, and his father was made a count by Emperor Napoleon I. His father, Mathieu de Lesseps (Hamburg, 4 May 1774 – Tunis, 28 December 1832), was in the consular service; his mother, Catherine de Grévigné (Málaga, 11 June 1774 – Paris, 27 January 1853), was Spanish on her mother&#x27;s side, and aunt of the countess of Montijo, mother of the Empress Eugénie. She was a daughter of Henri de Grevigné (baptised Notre-Dame-aux-Fonts, Liège, 2 June 1744) and wife (m.1766) Francisca Antonia Gallegos (1751–1853).

==Early years==
Ferdinand de Lesseps was born November 19, 1805, in Versailles. He had a sister, Adélaïde de Lesseps (1803–1879), married to Jules Tallien de Cabarrus (19 April 1801 – 1870); and two brothers, Théodore de Lesseps (Cádiz, 25 September 1802 – Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 20 May 1874), married in 1828 to Antonia Denois (Paris, 27 September 1802 – Paris, 29 December 1878); and Jules de Lesseps (Pisa, 16 February 1809 – Paris, 10 October 1887), married on 11 March 1874 to Hyacinthe Delarue.

His first years were spent in Italy, where his father was occupied with his consular duties. His father then was appointed the first consul of France in Morocco and in 1800 joined the Egyptian army as commissioner of commercial relations. There the Lesseps struck friendship with the local ruler, Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Ali Pasha wanted his fourth son Sa&#x27;id to have an athletic body, and to get rid of his obesity, so he ordered his young son to exercise daily for two hours and follow a very simple diet. To safeguard the child&#x27;s morals, he could visit no other house than that of de Lesseps. The young prince became friend of Ferdinand and &quot;both of them revelled in devouring immense quantities of spaghetti. This intimacy and his longing for pasta caused Muhammad Said to hurry to the French consulate whenever the frugal diet of the viceregal table left a void in his stomach&quot;.

After Ferdinand returned to France he was educated at the College of Henry IV in Paris. Sa&#x27;id was educated in Paris as well, and kept the friendship. From the age of 18 years to 20 he was employed in the commissary department of the army. From 1825 to 1827 he acted as assistant vice-consul at Lisbon, where his uncle, Barthélemy de Lesseps, was the French &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;. This uncle was an old companion of Jean-François de La Pérouse and the only survivor of the expedition in which La Pérouse perished. Barthélemy de Lesseps had left the expedition in Kamchatka to travel to St Petersburg overland.

==Career==
===Diplomatic===
In 1828, Lesseps was sent as an assistant vice-consul to Tunis, where his father was consul-general. He aided the escape of Youssouff, pursued by the soldiers of the Bey, of whom he was one of the officers, for violation of the seraglio law. Youssouff acknowledged this protection given by a Frenchman by distinguishing himself in the ranks of the French army at the time of the French conquest of Algeria. Lesseps was also entrusted by his father with missions to Marshal Count Bertrand Clausel, general-in-chief of the army of occupation in Algeria. The marshal wrote to Mathieu de Lesseps on 18 December 1830: &quot;I have had the pleasure of meeting your son, who gives promise of sustaining with great credit the name he bears.&quot;

In 1832, Lesseps was appointed vice-consul at Alexandria. While the vessel, in which Lesseps sailed to Egypt, was in quarantine at the Alexandrian lazaretto, M. Mimaut, consul-general of France at Alexandria, sent him several books, among which was the memoir written upon the previously filled and abandoned Ancient Suez Canal, according to Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s instructions, by the civil engineer Jacques-Marie Le Père, one of the scientific members of the French expedition.

This work struck Lesseps&#x27;s imagination, and was one of the influences that gave him the idea of constructing a canal across the African isthmus. Fortunately for Lesseps, Muhammad Ali, the viceroy of Egypt, owed his position in part to the recommendations made on his behalf to the French government by Lesseps himself, who was consul-general in Egypt when Ali was a colonel. Because of this, Lesseps received a warm welcome from the viceroy and became good friends with his son, Said Pasha. Politically, the British were allied with the Ottoman government in Istanbul (doing so in order to prevent the Russians from gaining access to the Mediterranean) and had also assisted in repelling Ali&#x27;s attempt to capture Istanbul in 1833. The French were able to manoeuvre in Egypt under Ali&#x27;s graces by playing off the British intervention against Ali in Istanbul.

In 1833, Lesseps was sent as consul to Cairo, and soon afterwards given the management of the consulate general at Alexandria, a post that he held until 1837. While in Egypt he encountered and was influenced by Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin, who was working on a dam north of Cairo for Ali while preaching for a union of the Mediterranean and Red Seas. While he was there an epidemic of plague broke out and lasted for two years, resulting in the deaths of more than a third of the inhabitants of Cairo and Alexandria. During this time Lesseps went from one city to the other with zeal and energy. Towards the close of the year 1837 he returned to France, and on 21 December married Agathe Delamalle (1819–1853), daughter of the government prosecuting attorney at the court of Angers. By this marriage de Lesseps became the father of five sons: Charles Théodore de Lesseps (1838–1838), Charles Aimé de Lesseps (1840–1923), Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps (1842–1846), Ferdinand Victor de Lesseps (1847–1853) and Aimé Victor de Lesseps (1848–1896).

In 1839, Lesseps was appointed consul at Rotterdam, and in the following year transferred to Málaga, the ancestral home of his mother&#x27;s family. In 1842 he was sent to Barcelona, and soon afterwards promoted to the grade of consul general. In the course of a bloody insurrection in Catalonia, which ended in the bombardment of Barcelona, de Lesseps offered protection to a number of men threatened by the fighting regardless of their factional sympathies or nationalities. From 1848 to 1849 he was minister of France at Madrid.

In 1849, the government of the French Republic sent Lesseps to Rome to negotiate the return of Pope Pius IX to the Vatican. He tried to negotiate an agreement whereby Pope Pius could return peacefully to the Vatican but also ensuring the continued independence of Rome. But, during negotiations, the elections in France caused a change in the foreign policy of the government – Alexis de Tocqueville replaced the previous foreign minister. Lesseps course was disapproved; he was recalled and brought before the Council of State. Louis-Napoleon needed a scapegoat and Lesseps was an easy target. Lesseps was accused of causing dishonor to the French army and was censured although he was not told to leave the Foreign Ministry.

Lesseps was created on 30 August 1851 the 334th Commander and then the 200th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.

Lesseps then retired from the diplomatic service, and never again occupied any public office. In 1853, he lost his wife and his son Ferdinand Victor at a few days&#x27; interval. In 1854, the accession to the viceroyalty of Egypt of Said Pasha gave Lesseps a new impulse to act upon the creation of a Suez Canal.

===Suez Canal===

Lesseps had corresponded at least once with the Société d&#x27;Études du Canal de Suez during the reign of Abbas I in Egypt, but Abbas had closed off most of Egypt to foreign influence. Upon Abbas&#x27; assassination in 1854, Lesseps made inquiries with a former, if short-term, acquaintance and successor in Egypt, Said Pasha. On 7 November 1854 he landed at Alexandria; on the 30th of the same month Said Pasha signed the concession authorizing him to build the Suez Canal.

A first scheme, initiated by Lesseps, was immediately drawn out by two French engineers who were in the Egyptian service, Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds called &quot;Linant Bey&quot; and Mougel Bey. This project, differing from others that were previously presented or that were in opposition to it, provided for a direct link between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. After being slightly modified, the plan was adopted in 1856 by the civil engineers constituting the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez. Encouraged by the engineers&#x27; approval, Lesseps no longer allowed anything to stop him. He listened to no adverse criticism and receded before no obstacle. Neither the opposition of Lord Palmerston, who considered the projected disturbance as too radical and a threat to the commercial position of the British Empire. Lesseps was similarly not deterred by the opinions entertained, in France as well as in Britain, that the sea in front of Port Said was full of mud which would obstruct the entrance to the canal, and that the sands from the desert would fill the trenches.

Lesseps succeeded in rousing the patriotism of the French and obtaining by their subscriptions more than half of the capital of two hundred million francs which he needed in order to form a company, but could not attract any substantial capital contribution from the general public in British or other foreign countries. The Egyptian government thus subscribed for eighty million francs worth of shares.

The Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez was organized at the end of 1858. On 25 April 1859, the first blow of the pickaxe was given by Lesseps at Port Said. During the following ten years, Lesseps had to overcome the continuing resistance of the British government, which kept the Sultan from approving the construction of the canal; at one stage even seeking the support of his cousin, Empress Eugenie, to persuade the Emperor Napoleon III to act as arbitrator in the disputes. Finally, on 17 November 1869, the canal was officially opened by the Khedive, Ismail Pasha.

While in the interests of his canal, Lesseps resisted British government opposition to an enterprise which threatened to give France control of the shortest route to India, he acted favourably towards Britain&#x27;s interests after Benjamin Disraeli acquired the Suez shares belonging to the Khedive, by admitting to the board of directors of the company three representatives from the government of Britain. The consolidation of interests which resulted, and which was strengthened by the addition in 1884 of seven more British directors, chosen from among shipping merchants and business men, increased, for the benefit of all concerned, the commercial character of the enterprise.

Lesseps steadily endeavored to keep out of politics. If, in 1869, he appeared to deviate from this principle by being a candidate at Marseille for the Corps Législatif, it was because he yielded to the entreaties of the Imperial government in order to strengthen its goodwill for the Suez Canal. Once this goodwill had been shown, he bore no malice towards those who rendered him his liberty by preferring Léon Gambetta. Afterward, Lesseps declined the other candidatures that were offered to him: for the Senate in 1876, and for the Chamber in 1877. In 1873, he became interested in a project for uniting Europe and Asia by a railway to Mumbai, with a branch to Beijing. The same year, he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He subsequently encouraged Major Roudaire, who wished to transform a stretch of the Sahara into an inland sea to increase rainfall in Algeria.

Lesseps accepted the presidency of the French committee of Leopold II of Belgium&#x27;s International African Society. From this position he facilitated Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza&#x27;s explorations, and acquired stations that Brazza subsequently abandoned to the French government. These stations were the starting-point of French Congo. Lesseps was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1879.

From 17 November 1899 to 23 December 1956, a monumental statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps by Emmanuel Frémiet stood at the entrance of the Suez Canal.

===Panama Canal attempt===
In May 1879, a congress of 136 delegates (including Lesseps) assembled in the rooms of the Société de géographie in Paris, under the presidency of Admiral de la Roncire le Noury, and voted in favor of the creation of a Panama Canal, which was to be without locks, like the Suez Canal. Lesseps was appointed President of the Panama Canal Company, despite the fact that he had reached the age of 74. It was on this occasion that Gambetta bestowed upon him the title of &quot;Le Grand Français&quot;. However, the decision to dig a Panama Canal at sea level to avoid the use of locks, and the inability of contemporaneous medical science to deal with epidemics of malaria and yellow fever, doomed the project.
In February 1880, Lesseps arrived in New York City to raise money for the project. When he stayed at the Windsor Hotel, its staff flew the French flag in his honor. He met the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Geographic Society while touring the area. Lesseps then went to Washington D.C., met with President Rutherford B. Hayes, and testified to the House Interoceanic Canal Committee. He later went to Boston, Chicago, and several other American cities to raise interest and capital for the project.

In June 1880, Lesseps gave a speech in Liverpool where he was able to find support from a Captain Peacock, who felt the canal project was worth supporting as it would provide routes to save time.

Lesseps went with his youngest child to Panama to see the planned pathway. He estimated in 1880 that the project would take 658 million francs and eight years to complete. After two years of surveys, work on the canal began in 1882. However, the technical difficulties of operating in the wet tropics dogged the project. Particularly disastrous were recurrent landslides into the excavations from the bordering water-saturated hills, and the death toll from malaria and yellow fever. In the end, insufficient financial capital and financial corruption ended the project. The Panama Canal Company declared itself bankrupt in December 1888 and entered liquidation in February 1889.

The failure of the project is sometimes referred to as the Panama Canal Scandal, after rumors circulated that French politicians and journalists had received bribes. By 1892 it emerged that 150 French deputies had been bribed into voting for the allocation of financial aid to the Panama Canal Company, and in February 1893 Lesseps, his son Charles (born 1849), and a number of others faced trial and were found guilty. Lesseps was ordered to pay a fine and serve a prison sentence, but the latter was overturned by the Court of Cassation on the grounds that it had been more than three years since the crime was committed. Ultimately, in 1904 the United States bought out the assets of the Company and resumed work under a revised plan.

==Second marriage and issue==
In Paris on November 25, 1869—a week after the opening of the Suez Canal—Lesseps married his second wife, who was a third his age. Louise-Hélène Autard de Bragard was born on the island of Mauritius in 1848 at Plaines Wilhems and died on 29 January 1909 at Château de La Chesnay in Guilly, Vatan, Indre. 
She was the daughter of Gustave Adolphe Autard de Bragard, a former Magistrate of Mauritius, and wife Marie-Louise Carcenac (1817–1857), daughter of Pierre Carcenac (1771–1819) and wife Marie Françoise Dessachis. Eleven of her twelve children (six boys and six girls) with Lesseps survived their father:

==Statue of Liberty==
On 11 June 1884, Levi P. Morton, the Minister of the United States to France, gave a banquet in honor of the Franco-American Union and in celebration of the completion of the Statue of Liberty. Ferdinand de Lesseps, as head of the Franco-American Union, formally presented the statue to the United States, saying:

This is the result of the devoted enthusiasm, the intelligence and the noblest sentiments which can inspire man. It is great in its conception, great in its execution, great in its proportions; let us hope that it will add, by its moral value, to the memories and sympathies that it is intended to perpetuate. We now transfer to you, Mr. Minister, this great statue and trust that it may forever stand the pledge of friendship between France and the Great Republic of the United States.

In October 1886, Lesseps traveled to the United States to speak at the dedication ceremony of the Statue of Liberty on the date of the 28th, and attended by President Grover Cleveland.

==Death==

Lesseps died at Château de La Chesnaye in Guilly, Vatan, Indre, on 7 December 1894. He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. The grave stands at one of the junctions amongst other large family tombs.

==Legacy==

On 26 July 1956, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser used de Lesseps&#x27; surname as the codeword to Egyptian personnel designated to seize the offices of Suez Canal Company. Nasser used the codeword repeatedly in a public address in Alexandria that was broadcast to the nation via radio, and minutes later announced that he had issued a presidential decree nationalising the Suez Canal Company. The statue of Lesseps at the entrance of the Suez Canal was removed from its pedestal, to symbolize the end of European control of the waterway. The statue now stands in a small garden of the Port Fuad shipyard.

==In popular culture==
Lesseps was portrayed by Tyrone Power in the 1938 film &quot;Suez&quot;, with Loretta Young, a film which provoked complaints and legal action from Lesseps&#x27; family and the Egyptian government.

In addition, Manuel Soto played the part in a 1944 Spanish feature film, &quot;Eugenia de Montijo&quot;. On television, Guy Marchand played Lesseps in the 1983 French/German mini-series &quot;L&#x27;homme de Suez&quot;, and John Walters portrayed him in &quot;The Panama Canal&quot;, an episode of the 2003 BBC docu-drama series &quot;Seven Wonders of the Industrial World&quot;.

Lesseps appears as a great engineer in the game &quot;Civilization V&quot;.

Lesseps is also discussed extensively in the David McCullough book &quot;The Path Between the Seas&quot;.

Lesseps&#x27; descendant Alexandre de Lesseps was married to LuAnn Nadeau (better known as Luann de Lesseps), a main cast member of the Bravo reality TV show &quot;The Real Housewives of New York&quot;.

Most recently, he has focused his research on the value structure of economic theory and its consequences for global civil and environmental life. McMurtry was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) in June 2001 by his peers for his work regarding the study of humanities and social sciences.

McMurtry&#x27;s principal research project in Philosophy spanning over seven years has followed from the invitation by the Secretariat of UNESCO/Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS, Paris-Oxford) to construct, author and edit &quot;Philosophy and World Problems&quot; as a multi-volume study of world philosophy. Three sub-volumes entitled &quot;Western Philosophy and the Life-Ground&quot;, &quot;Modes of Reason&quot;, and &quot;Philosophy, Human Nature and Society&quot; have been written with internationally distinguished philosophers contributing to five topic areas in each of these general fields.

The central title study by McMurtry, entitled, &quot;What is Good, What is Bad? The Value of All Values Across Time, Place and Theories&quot;, is an encompassing in-depth critical study of known world philosophies and fields to explain the inner logic of each canon and school in relationship to world problems across languages and eras including the method of life-value onto-axiology which is deployed to excavate, explain and resolve life-blind presuppositions of the world&#x27;s major thought-systems from the ancients East and West to modern and contemporary philosophy.

==Biography==
John McMurtry received his doctorate from University College, London in the United Kingdom after completing his BA and MA at the University of Toronto, Canada where he also joined the Zeta Psi fraternity. Prior to doctoral studies, he was &quot;a professional football player, print and television journalist, academic English teacher and world-traveller&quot;. In his autobiographic article &quot;The Human Vocation: An Autobiography of Higher Education&quot; for the scholarly journal Nordicum-Mediterraneum, McMurtry recounts the most salient moments of his formative years and states that he &quot;came to philosophy as a last resort, because as someone naturally disposed to question unexamined assumptions and conventional beliefs, I could find no other profession which permitted this vocation at the appropriate level of research.&quot;

Value theory is his unifying field of research, as he has published and taught in as diverse fields of inquiry as social and political philosophy, Asian/Indian and Chinese philosophy, philosophy of economics, philosophy of education, philosophy and literature, philosophy of history, post-Kant continental philosophy, the logic of natural language, and philosophy of the environment.

He is also part of the peace movement and international law study bodies. He served as Chair of Jurists, War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Tribunal at the Alternative World Summit in Toronto, 1989. His professional work has been published in over 150 books and journals, including Inquiry, the Monist, the Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Praxis International, the Encyclopaedia of Ethics, Atlantic Monthly, Guardian Weekly, and the Norton Anthology of Prose.

==Political, philosophical, and economic views==
McMurtry&#x27;s recent research has focused on the underlying value structure of economic theory, its consequences for global civil and environmental life, and the life ground and civil commons. McMurtry considers the global free market &quot;inefficient and life-destructive&quot; in proportion to how unregulated it is by life needs (that without which life capacity is reduced) and by life capital (human and ecological life wealth that reproduces more life wealth if not run down). In general, four principles of analysis and development are applied: the life-ground (all the conditions required to take one&#x27;s next breath), life value (whatever enables life capacities), life capital (means of life that can produce more means of life without loss and cumulative gain), and civil commons (any social construct that enables universal access of community members to life goods through time).

In &quot;Unequal Freedoms: The Global Market As An Ethical System&quot;, 1998, he examines the underlying value system of the global market and claims that it constructs the opposite of the &quot;free and democratic society&quot; it claims to bring about.

In &quot;The Cancer Stage of Capitalism&quot;, 1999, he claims a propensity of human societies to assume the social order in which they live as good however life-destructive they may be, focusing on financial capitalism as displaying the hallmark characteristics of a cancer invasion at the social level of life organization. He conceives &quot;the civil commons&quot; as a social immune system.

In &quot;Value Wars: The Global Market Versus the Life Economy&quot;, 2002, he criticizes capitalist scientific technology, transnational trade apparatuses, NATO wars, and an expanding prison regime as symptoms of a &quot;new totalitarianism cumulatively occupying the world and propelling civil and ecological breakdowns&quot;, and proposes constitutional standards of a &quot;life economy&quot;.

McMurtry addressed the 9/11 conspiracy theories to explain the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In one lecture, he drew comparisons to the event of the Reichstag fire and argued that the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) was lobbied for and exploited by multinational corporations. Journalist Jonathan Kay includes him among the most influential Canadian members of the largely American 9/11 truth movement.

<text>Kim Deitch (born May 21, 1944 in Los Angeles, California) is an American cartoonist who was an important figure in the underground comix movement of the 1960s, remaining active in the decades that followed with a variety of books and comics, sometimes using the pseudonym Fowlton Means.

Much of Kim Deitch&#x27;s work deals with the animation industry and characters from the world of cartoons. His best-known character is a mysterious cat named Waldo, who appears variously as a famous cartoon character of the 1930s, as an actual character in the &quot;reality&quot; of the strips, as the hallucination of a hopeless alcoholic surnamed Mishkin (a victim of the Boulevard of Broken Dreams), as the demonic reincarnation of Judas Iscariot; and who, occasionally, is claimed to have overcome Deitch and written the comics himself. Waldo&#x27;s appearance is reminiscent of such black cat characters as Felix the Cat, Julius the Cat, and Krazy Kat.

The son of illustrator and animator Gene Deitch, Kim Deitch has sometimes worked with his brothers Simon Deitch and Seth Deitch.

== Biography ==
Deitch&#x27;s influences include Winsor McCay, Chester Gould, Jack Cole, and Will Eisner; he attended the Pratt Institute. Before deciding to become a professional cartoonist, Deitch worked odd jobs and did manual labor, including with the merchant marine. Searching for a path, he at one point joined the Republican Party; at another point he became devotee of Hatha yoga.

Deitch regularly contributed comical, psychedelia-tinged comic strips (featuring the flower child &quot;Sunshine Girl&quot; and &quot;Uncle Ed, The India Rubber Man&quot;) to New York City&#x27;s premier underground newspaper, the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, beginning in 1967. He joined Bhob Stewart as an editor of EVO&#x27;s all-comics spin-off, &quot;Gothic Blimp Works&quot;, in 1969. During this period, he lived with fellow cartoonist Spain Rodriguez in a sixth-floor walk-up apartment in New York&#x27;s East Village.

Deitch was also a publisher, as co-founder of the Cartoonists Co-Op Press, a publishing venture by Deitch, Jay Lynch, Bill Griffith, Jerry Lane, Willy Murphy, Diane Noomin, and Art Spiegelman that operated in 1973–1974.

Deitch&#x27;s &quot;The Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2005 as one of the 100 best English-language graphic novels ever written. In 2008, the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art featured a retrospective exhibition of his work.

== Personal life ==
From his first relationship, to cartoonist and author Trina Robbins, Deitch has a daughter, Casey.
Through most of the 1970s, Deitch was in an 11-year relationship with animator Sally Cruikshank. He met Pam Butler in 1994 and they subsequently married.

==Awards==
Deitch won the 2003 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue for &quot;The Stuff of Dreams&quot; (Fantagraphics) and in 2008 he was awarded an Inkpot Award. In 2014, he was nominated for the Ignatz Award for Outstanding Graphic Novel for &quot;The Amazing, Enlightening and Absolutely True Adventures of Katherine Whaley&quot;.

<text>Mountstuart Elphinstone (6 October 1779 – 20 November 1859) was a Scottish and historian, associated with the government of British India. He later became the Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) where he is credited with the opening of several educational institutions accessible to the Indian population. Besides being a noted administrator, he wrote books on India and Afghanistan. His works are pertinent examples of the colonial historiographical trend.

==Early life==
Born in Dumbarton, Dumbartonshire (now Dunbartonshire) on 6 October 1779, educated at the Royal High School. He was the fourth son of the 11th Baron Elphinstone, by Anna, daughter of Lord Ruthven, in the peerage of Scotland. Having been appointed to the civil service of the British East India Company, of which one of his uncles was a director, he arrived at Calcutta (now Kolkata) early in 1796 where he filled several subordinate posts. In 1799, he escaped massacre in Benares (now Varanasi) by the followers of the deposed Nawab of Awadh Wazir Ali Khan. In 1801 he was transferred to the Diplomatic Service where he was posted as the assistant to the British resident Josiah Webbe at the court of the Peshwa ruler Baji Rao II.

==Envoy==
In the Peshwa court he obtained his first opportunity of distinction, being attached in the capacity of diplomatist to the mission of Sir Arthur Wellesley to the Marathas. When, on the failure of negotiations, war broke out, Elphinstone, though a civilian, acted as virtual &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Wellesley. At the Battle of Assaye, and throughout the campaign, he displayed rare courage and knowledge of tactics such that Wellesley told him he ought to have been a soldier. In 1804, when the war ended, Elphinstone was appointed British resident at Nagpur. This gave him plenty of leisure time, which he spent in reading and study. Later, in 1807, he completed a short stint at Gwalior.

In 1808 he was appointed the first British envoy to the court of Kabul, Afghanistan, with the object of securing a friendly alliance with the Afghans against Napoleon&#x27;s planned advance on India. However this proved of little value, because Shah Shuja was driven from the throne by his brother before it could be ratified. The most valuable permanent result of the embassy was in Elphinstone&#x27;s work titled &quot;Account of the Kingdom of Cabul and its Dependencies in Persia and India&quot; (1815).

After spending about a year in Calcutta arranging the report of his mission, Elphinstone was appointed in 1811 to the important and difficult post of resident at Pune. The difficulty arose from the general complication of Maratha politics, and especially from the weakness of the Peshwas, which Elphinstone rightly read from the first. The tenuous peace between the Peshwas was broken in 1817 with the Marathas declaring war on the British. Elphinstone assumed command of the military during an important crisis during the Battle of Khadki also called Third Anglo-Maratha War and managed to secure a victory despite his non-military background. As reparations, Peshwa territories were annexed by the British. Elphinstone became the Commissioner of the Deccan in 1818.

==Governor==

In 1819, Elphinstone was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Bombay, a post he held until 1827. During his tenure, he greatly promoted education in India, at a time when opinion in Britain was against educating the &quot;natives&quot;. He may fairly be regarded as the founder of the system of state education in India. One of his principal achievements was the compilation of the &quot;Elphinstone code.&quot; He also returned many lands that had appropriated by the British to the Raja of Satara.

He built the first bungalow in Malabar Hill during this time, and following his example, many prominent people took up residence here. It soon became a fashionable locality, and remains so to the present.

His connection with the Bombay Presidency is commemorated in the endowment of Elphinstone College by local communities, and in the erection of a marble statue by the European inhabitants. However, the Elphinstone Road railway station and the Elphinstone Circle, both in Mumbai city, are not named after him but in honour of his nephew, John, 13th Lord Elphinstone, who later also became Governor of Bombay in the 1850s. One of Karachi&#x27;s main commercial streets was previously named Elphinstone Street but has been renamed Zaibunnisa Street.

The township of Elphinstone, Victoria, Australia, was named after him. The suburb of Mount Stuart, Tasmania, Australia, and its main road, Elphinstone Road, were also named after him.

There is a statue of him in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.

==Return to Great Britain==
Returning to Britain in 1829, after an interval of two years&#x27; travel, Elphinstone continued to influence public affairs, but based in England rather than Scotland. Nevertheless, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1830 with his proposer being Sir John Robison.

He was one of the seven founders of the Royal Geographical Society which formed on 16 July 1830.

He twice refused appointment as Governor-General of India, preferring to finish his two-volume work, &quot;History of India&quot; (1841). He died in Hookwood, Surrey, England, on 20 November 1859. He is buried in Limpsfield churchyard. There is also a memorial to him in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

James Sutherland Cotton later wrote his biography as part of the Rulers of India series in 1892.

The historian James Grant Duff named his son after Elphinstone.

<doc id="314528" wikidata="Q60178" url="?curid=314528" title="Johannes Trithemius">
<text>Johannes Trithemius (; 1 February 1462 – 13 December 1516), born Johann Heidenberg, was a German Benedictine abbot and a polymath who was active in the German Renaissance as a lexicographer, chronicler, cryptographer, and occultist. He is considered the founder of modern cryptography (a claim shared with Leon Battista Alberti) and steganography, as well as the founder of bibliography and literary studies as branches of knowledge. He had considerable influence on the development of early modern and modern occultism. His students included Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus.

==Early life==
The byname &quot;Trithemius&quot; refers to his native town of Trittenheim on the Moselle River, at the time part of the Electorate of Trier.

When Johannes was still an infant his father, Johann von Heidenburg, died. His stepfather, whom his mother Elisabeth married seven years later, was hostile to education and thus Johannes could only learn in secret and with many difficulties. He learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. When he was 17 years old he escaped from his home and wandered around looking for good teachers, travelling to Trier, Cologne, the Netherlands, and Heidelberg. He studied at the University of Heidelberg.

==Career==
Travelling from the university to his home town in 1482, he was surprised by a snowstorm and took refuge in the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim near Bad Kreuznach. He decided to stay and was elected abbot in 1483, at the age of twenty-one. He often served as featured speaker and chapter secretary at the Bursfelde Congregation&#x27;s annual chapter from 1492 to 1503, the annual meeting of reform-minded abbots. Trithemius also supervised the visits of the Congregation&#x27;s abbeys.

Trithemius wrote extensively as a historian, starting with a chronicle of Sponheim and culminating in a two-volume work on the history of Hirsau Abbey. His work was distinguished by mastery of the Latin language and eloquent phrasing, yet it was soon discovered that he inserted several fictional passages into his works. 
Even during Trithemius&#x27;s lifetime, several critics pointed out the invented sources he used.
 His forgery regarding the connection between the Franks and the Trojans was part of a larger project to establish a link between the current dynasty of Austria with ancient heroes. While his colleagues like Jakob Mennel and Ladislaus Suntheim often inserted invented ancestors in their works, Trithemius invented entire sources, such as Hunibald, supposedly a Scythian historian. For his research on monasteries, he utilized “Meginfrid,” an imagined early chronicler of Fulda and Meginfrid&#x27;s nonexistent treatise &quot;De temporibus gratiae&quot; to substantiate Trithemius&#x27;s ideal of monastic piety and erudition, which were supposed to be the same values shared by the monks of the ninth century. Others opine that Meginfrid was not strictly forgery but the combination of wishful thinking with faulty memory.

In the process though, Trithemius became a famous builder of libraries, which he created in Sponheim and Würzburg. In Sponheim, he set out to transform the abbey from a neglected and undisciplined place into a centre of learning. In his time, the abbey library increased from around fifty items to more than two thousand.

His efforts did not meet with praise, and his reputation as a magician did not further his acceptance. Increasing differences with the convent led to his resignation in 1506, when he decided to take up the offer of the Bishop of Würzburg, Lorenz von Bibra (bishop from 1495 to 1519), to become the abbot of St. James&#x27;s Abbey, the &quot;Schottenkloster&quot; in Würzburg. He remained there until the end of his life.

Trithemius seemed to have a falling out with Maximilian regarding their differences when the emperor wanted to organize a separate ecclesiastical council in 1511, in slight of Pope Julius II. The relationship recovered after Julius&#x27;s death, though.

==Death==
Trithemius was buried in St. James&#x27;s Abbey&#x27;s church; a tombstone by the famous Tilman Riemenschneider was erected in his honor. In 1825, the tombstone was moved to the Neumünster church, next to the cathedral. It was damaged in the firebombing of 1945, and subsequently restored by the workshop of Theodor Spiegel.

==Legacy==
Notably, the German polymath, physician, legal scholar, soldier, theologian, and occult writer Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535) and the Swiss physician, alchemist, and astrologer Paracelsus (1493–1541) were among his pupils.

==The Faust legend==

Trithemius had a reputation as a necromancer. The Faust legend is strongly based on a legend involving Maximilian of Austria, his first wife Mary of Burgundy and Trithemius. Through his 1507 account, Trithemius was the first author who mentioned the historical Doctor Faustus, or Johann Faust of Knittlingen. In a letter he wrote to the polymath Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, another famous occult writer and supposed magician – he appeared to criticize the vanity of Faust, who possessed inferior skills and went against the teachings of the Church. Literary scholar Andrew McCarthy opines that Trithemius considered himself a true necromancer, who studied in order to gain knowledge of the workings of the universe without attracting publicity.

Being summoned to the emperor&#x27;s court in 1506 and 1507, he also helped to &quot;prove&quot; Maximilian&#x27;s Trojan origins. In the 1569 edition of his Tischreden, Martin Luther writes about a magician and necromancer, understood to be Trithemius, who summoned Alexander the Great and other ancient heroes, as well as the emperor&#x27;s deceased wife Mary of Burgundy, to entertain Maximilian. In his 1585 account, Augustin Lercheimer (1522–1603) writes that after Mary&#x27;s death, Trithemius was summoned to console a devastated Maximilian. Trithemius conjured a shade of Mary, who looked exactly like her when alive. Maximilian also recognized a birthmark on her neck, that only he knew about. He was distraught by the experience though, and ordered Trithemius never to do it again. An anonymous account in 1587 modified the story into a less sympathetic version. The emperor became Charles V, who, despite knowing about the risk of black magic, ordered Faustus to raise Alexander and his wife from death. Charles saw that the woman had a birthmark, which he had heard about. Later, the woman in Goethe&#x27;s Faust became Helen of Troy. The story of Maximilian, Mary of Burgundy and the Abbot &quot;Johannes Trithem&quot; later appeared as one of the Grimms&#x27; Tales.

According to John Henry Jones, the blooming of the Faustus myth was fuelled by the witch craze of the time.

==&quot;Steganographia&quot;==


Trithemius&#x27; most famous work, &quot;Steganographia&quot; (written c. 1499; published Frankfurt, 1606), was placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; in 1609 and removed in 1900. This book is in three volumes, and appears to be about magic—specifically, about using spirits to communicate over long distances. Since the publication of the decryption key to the first two volumes in 1606, they have been known to be actually concerned with cryptography and steganography. Until the 1990s, the third volume was widely still believed to be solely about magic, but the &quot;magical&quot; formulae have now been shown to be covertexts for yet more cryptographic content. However, mentions of the magical work within the third book by such figures as Agrippa and John Dee still lend credence to the idea of a mystic-magical foundation concerning the third volume. Additionally, while Trithemius&#x27;s steganographic methods can be established to be free of the need for angelic–astrological mediation, still left intact is an underlying theological motive for their contrivance. The preface to the &quot;Polygraphia&quot; equally establishes that the everyday practicability of cryptography was conceived by Trithemius as a &quot;secular consequent of the ability of a soul specially empowered by God to reach, by magical means, from earth to Heaven&quot;. Robert Hooke suggested, in the chapter &quot;Of Dr. Dee&#x27;s Book of Spirits&quot;, that John Dee made use of Trithemian steganography to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I. Amongst the codes used in this book is the Ave Maria cipher, where each coded letter is replaced by a short sentence about Jesus in Latin.
The reason for &quot;Polygraphia&quot; and &quot;Steganographia&quot; as covertexts being written are unknown. Possible explanations are that either its real target audience was the selected few such as Maximilian, or that Trithemius wanted to attract public attention to a tedious field.

<text>Button Bay, previously known as Button Mould Bay or Buttonmold Bay, is an area of shallow water on the east shore of Lake Champlain. It is located in the town of Ferrisburgh (near Vergennes), in Addison County. It is situated between the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains in New York.

The Bay&#x27;s name is from the clay concretions found on its shores which looked either like actual clay buttons or the moulds used in button making.

Button Bay State Park has been a state park since 1964.

<text>Dost Mohammad Khan Barakzai (Pashto/; 23 December 1792 – 8 June 1863), nicknamed the Amir-i Kabir, was the founder of the Barakzai dynasty and one of the prominent rulers of Afghanistan during the First Anglo-Afghan War. With the decline of the Durrani dynasty, he became the Emir of Afghanistan in 1826. An ethnic Pashtun, he belonged to the Barakzai tribe. He was the 11th son of Payinda Khan, chief of the Barakzai Pashtuns, who was killed in 1799 by King Zaman Shah Durrani.

At the beginning of his rule, the Afghans lost their former stronghold of Peshawar Valley in March 1823 to the Sikh Khalsa Army of Ranjit Singh at the Battle of Nowshera. The Afghan forces in the battle were led by Azim Khan, half-brother of Dost Mohammad Khan. By the end of his reign, he had reunited the principalities of Kandahar and Herat with Kabul. Dost had ruled for a lengthy 36 years, a span exceeded only by Zahir Shah more than a century later.

A brilliant strategist, and ruthless fighter from a young age, Dost Mohammad is regarded as one of the greatest rulers in the history of Afghanistan, his myriad of campaigns had successfully forged the cities of Kabul, Kandahar, and Herat into one state, which all his predecessors, with the exception of Ahmad Shah Durrani, had failed to do.

== Background and rise to power ==
Dost Mohammad Khan was born to an influential Pashtun family on 23 December 1792 in Kandahar, Durrani Empire. His father, Payinda Khan, was chief of the Barakzai Tribe and a civil servant in the Durrani dynasty. Their family can be traced back to Abdal (the first and founder of the Abdali tribe), through Hajji Jamal Khan, Yousef, Yaru, Mohammad, Omar Khan, Khisar Khan, Ismail, Nek, Daru, Saifal, and Barak. Abdal had four sons, Popal, Barak, and Alako. Dost Mohammad Khan&#x27;s mother belonged to the Qizilbash group. Dost Mohammad Khan spoke Pashto, Persian, Punjabi and Turkish. He was also credited with knowledge of Kashmiri by Mohan Lal.

His elder brother, the chief of the Barakzai, Fateh Khan, took an important part in installing Mahmud Shah Durrani as the sovereign of Afghanistan in 1800 and in restoring him to the throne in 1809. Dost Mohammad accompanied his elder brother and then Prime Minister of Kabul Wazir Fateh Khan to the Battle of Attock against the invading Sikhs. Mahmud Shah repaid Fateh Khan&#x27;s services by having him brutally assassinated in 1818, thus incurring the enmity of his tribe. After a bloody conflict, Mahmud Shah was deprived of all his possessions but Herat, the rest of his dominions being divided among Fateh Khan&#x27;s brothers. Of these, Dost Mohammad received Ghazni, to which in 1826 he added Kabul, the richest of the Afghan provinces. At the time of his enthronement, his government revenue was about 500,000 rupees, and by the 1830s it had increased to 2.5 million rupees.

From the commencement of his reign he found himself involved in disputes with Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of the Punjab region, who used the dethroned Sadozai prince, Shah Shujah Durrani, as his instrument. In 1834, Shah Shujah made an attempt to recover his kingdom. Dost Mohammad Khan mobilized for this, beginning initially with the Jalalabad campaign, and then marching on Kandahar, where Shah Shuja was defeated by Dost Mohammad Khan under the walls of Kandahar, but Ranjit Singh seized the opportunity to annex Peshawar which was ruled by the Peshawar Sardars under his deposed brother, Sultan Mohammad Khan. Dost Mohammad sent his son Akbar Khan to defeat the Sikhs at the Battle of Jamrud in 1837.

== European influence in Afghanistan ==

At the intersection of British, Russian and, to a lesser degree, French imperial interests, political maneuvering was necessary. Rejecting overtures from Russia, he endeavoured to form an alliance with Great Britain, and welcomed Alexander Burnes to Kabul in 1837. Burnes, however, was unable to prevail on the governor-general, Lord Auckland, to respond to the Emir&#x27;s advances. Dost Mohammad was enjoined to abandon the attempt to recover Peshawar, and to place his foreign policy under British guidance. He replied by renewing his relations with Russia, and in 1838 Lord Auckland set the British troops in motion against him. To enable such an action, the British manufactured the evidence needed to justify the overthrow of the Afghan ruler.

== War with the Sikhs ==

In 1835, Dost Mohammad Khan, the youngest and the most energetic of the Barakzai brothers, who had supplanted the Durrani dynasty and become Emir (lord, chief or king) of Kabul in 1825, advanced up to Khaibar Pass threatening to recover Peshawar. In 1836, Hari Singh Nalwa, the Sikh general who along with Prince Nau Nihal Singh was guarding that frontier, built a chain of forts, including one at Jamrud at the eastern end of the Khyber Pass to defend the pass. Dost Muhammad erected a fort at `Ali Masjid at the other end. In the beginning of 1837, as Prince Nau Nihal Singh returned to Lahore to get married and the Maharaja and his court got busy with preparations for the wedding.

Dost Muhammad Khan sent a 25,000 strong force, including a large number of local irregulars and equipped with 18 heavy guns, to invest Jamrud. The Sikh garrison there had only 600 men and a few light artillery pieces. The Afghans besieged the fort and cut off its water supply, while a detachment was sent to the neighbouring Sikh fort of Shabqadar to prevent any help from that direction. Mahan Singh Mirpuri, the garrison commander of Jamrud, kept the invaders at bay for four days and managed meanwhile to send a desperate appeal for help to Hari Singh Nalva at Peshawar. Nalva rose from his sick bed and rushed to Jamrud.

The final battle was fought on 30 April 1837, the Afghans withdrew from battle after Hari Singh Nalva was killed. In 1838, with the help and agreement of the Sikh monarch who joined the Tripartite Treaty with British viceroy Lord Auckland, restored Shah Shuja to the Afghan throne in Kabul on 7 August 1839. Dost Muhammad Khan was exiled by the British to Mussoorie in November 1840, but was restored to his former position after the murder of Shah Shuja in April 1842. He thereafter maintained cordial relations with the Lahore Darbar. These events led to the First Anglo-Afghan War.

== Second reign ==
After the end of the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1842, Dost Mohammad Khan was now in a position to expand his state dramatically. This was in part due to the improving relationship between Dost Mohammad Khan and the British. During his exile in Calcutta, he was treated warmly. 

He took note of the technological superiority of the British and was convinced that constant wars with them would damage Afghanistan. Instead, Dost Mohammad would advocate for an alliance with the British as the only way to ensure the survival of the state. With the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars eliminating any threat that the volatile Sikh Empire would have had on Afghanistan, Dost Mohammad Khan was now able to freely expand his kingdom with the help of the British, realizing that he and British had common Central Asian goals.

In 1843, Dost Mohammad Khan subdued the Hazarajat (Behsud, Dai Zangi, Dai Kundi) and Bamian, which had seized the power vacuum during the British invasion to become independent. In 1846, a rebellion by the Kohistani Tajiks of Tagab was suppressed and Dost Mohammad was able to consolidate his position on that traditionally rebellious area. In July 1848, he intended to send a force to conquer Balkh but the Second Anglo-Sikh War prevented this and occupied Dost Mohammad for another year. The Sikhs proposed to cede Peshawar to the Afghans (although it never became a reality) and as a result, Mohammad sent 5,000 Afghans under Mohammad Akram Khan to aid the Sikhs in the war. When the Sikhs were defeated and the British retook Peshawar, it was feared in Kabul that the British would follow up their victory by invading Afghanistan. However, this never happened and Dost Mohammad therefore sent his son, Mohammad Akram Khan, to invade Balkh in the Spring of 1849.

=== Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat ===

The invasion of Balkh was successful and the province was annexed into Afghanistan. When Afzal Khan would take materials from the dilapidated city of Balkh and use it to construct a cantonment known as Takhtapul nearby, so that by 1854 Takhtapul was a fully grown city complete with gardens and courts. In 1850 Mohammad Akram Khan&#x27;s half brother, Ghulam Haidar Khan, conquered Tashqurghan and the Mir Wali was forced to flee.

=== Alliance with the British ===

On 30 March 1855, Dost Mohammad reversed his former policy by concluding an offensive and defensive alliance with the British government, signed by Sir Henry Lawrence, Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, first proposed by Herbert Edwardes. In November 1855, he conquered Kandahar. In 1857, he declared war on Persia in conjunction with the British, and in July, a treaty was concluded by which the province of Herat was placed under a Barakzai prince. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Dost Mohammad refrained from assisting the insurgents. His later years were disturbed by troubles at Herat and in Bukhara.

=== Conquest of Herat and Death ===
In March 1862, Ahmad Khan, the ruler of Herat, captured Farah, which had been controlled by the Barakzai Emirs since 30 October 1856. This became Dost Mohammad Khan&#x27;s cassus belli to launch an attack on Herat. On 29 June or 8 July, Farah was captured by the Muhammadzais. On 22 July, Sabzawar was captured. By 28 July, Herat was besieged. After a 10-month siege on 27 May 1863, he captured Herat, but on 9 June, he died suddenly in the midst of victory, after playing a great role in the history of South and Central Asia for forty years. He named his son, Sher Ali Khan, as his successor. He was buried in Herat at the Gazurgah. By the time of his death, the annual state revenue of his government had risen to 7 million rupees.

<text>Tianlong (; lit. &quot;heavenly dragon&quot;) is a flying dragon in Chinese mythology, a star in Chinese astrology, and a proper name.

==Word==
The term &quot;tianlong&quot; combines &quot;tian&quot; &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;long&quot; &quot;dragon&quot;. Since &quot;tian&quot; literally means &quot;heaven; the heavens; sky&quot; or figuratively &quot;Heaven; God; gods&quot;, &quot;tianlong&quot; can denote &quot;heavenly dragon; celestial dragon&quot; or &quot;holy dragon; divine dragon&quot;.

Tianlong is homophonous with another name in Chinese folklore. Tianlong &quot;Heavenly Deaf&quot; (with the character &quot;long&quot; &quot;deaf&quot; combining the &quot;ear radical&quot; and a &quot;long&quot; phonetic element) and &quot;Diya&quot; &quot;Earthly Dumb&quot; are legendary attendants to Wenchang Wang , the patron deity of literature.

==Meanings==
From originally denoting &quot;heavenly dragon&quot;, &quot;Tianlong&quot; semantically developed meanings as Buddhist &quot;heavenly Nāgas&quot; or &quot;Devas and Nāgas&quot;, &quot;centipede&quot;, and &quot;proper names&quot; of stars, people, and places.

===Dragons===
Among Chinese classic texts, &quot;tian&quot; &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;long&quot; &quot;dragon&quot; were first used together in Zhou dynasty (1122 BCE – 256 BCE) writings, but the word &quot;tianlong&quot; was not recorded until the Han dynasty (207 BCE – 220 CE).

The ancient &quot;Yijing&quot; &quot;Book of Changes&quot; exemplifies using &quot;tian&quot; &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;long&quot; &quot;dragon&quot; together. &quot;Qian&quot; &quot;The Creative&quot;, the first hexagram, says: Commentaries on these explain: 

The earliest usage of &quot;tianlong&quot; &quot;heavenly dragon&quot;, according to the &quot;Hanyu Da Cidian&quot;, is in the &quot;Xinxu&quot; &quot;New Prefaces&quot; by Liu Xiang (79–8 BCE). It records a story about Zigao, the Duke of Ye, who professed to love dragons. After he carved and painted dragon images throughout his house, a [] heavenly dragon [or &quot;fulong&quot; in some editions] came to visit, but Ye was scared and ran away.

The &quot;Fangyan&quot; dictionary by Yang Xiong (53 BCE – 18 CE) has another early usage of &quot;tian&quot; and &quot;long&quot;. It defines &quot;panlong&quot; &quot;coiled dragon&quot; as , syntactically meaning either &quot;Dragons which do not yet ascend to heaven&quot; or &quot;Heavenly Dragons which do not yet ascend&quot;.

===Asterisms===
&quot;Tianlong&quot; Heavenly Dragon names both the Western constellation Draco and a star in the Chinese constellation Azure Dragon.

&quot;Tianlongza&quot; &quot;Heavenly Dragon Seat/Constellation&quot; is the Chinese translation of Draco (from Latin &quot;Dragon&quot;), a constellation near the north celestial pole. The (1578 CE) &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; pharmacopeia&#x27;s entry for &quot;long&quot; &quot;dragon&quot; describes &quot;a pearl under its chin&quot;, and Read notes, 
The constellation Draco has the appearance of guarding and encircling the northern pole which is the centre of the movement of the fixed stars. The Chinese paintings of the Dragon straining after a mystical &quot;Pearl&quot; undoubtedly relate to this relationship to the North Pole Star, though other explanations are given for this. 

&quot;Tianlong&quot; &quot;Heavenly Dragon&quot; is the 3rd star in &quot;Fangxiu&quot; &quot;Room (Chinese constellation)&quot; and corresponds to the Western constellation Scorpius. &quot;Room&quot; is the 4th of the Twenty-eight mansions in the Azure Dragon, which is one of the celestial Four Symbols. Wolfram Eberhard notes, &quot;When the dragon star appeared in the sky it was customary to make a sacrifice supplicating for rain,&quot; and this springtime dragon festival occurs on the 2nd day of the 2nd month.

===Centipede===
The &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; entry for &quot;wugong&quot; &quot;centipede&quot; lists &quot;tianlong&quot; &quot;heavenly dragon&quot; as an alternate name. Li Shizhen&#x27;s commentary reviews earlier Chinese commentators and texts. The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; says, &quot;People eat meat, deer eat grass, [] giant centipedes savor snakes, hawks and crows relish mice.&quot; The &quot;Huainanzi&quot; says, &quot;The [] ascending snake can drift in the mist, yet it is endangered by the [] centipede.&quot; The &quot;Erya&quot; dictionary defines &quot;jili&quot; &quot;thorns; puncture vine; bramble&quot; as &quot;jieju&quot; &quot;centipede; cricket&quot;; which Guo Pu&#x27;s commentary says resembles a &quot;huang&quot; &quot;locust&quot; with a large abdomen, long horns, and which eats snake brains. Although &quot;jieju&quot; can also mean &quot;xishuai&quot; &quot;cricket&quot;, Li concludes it means the snake-controlling &quot;wugong&quot; &quot;centipede&quot; that the &quot;Fangyan&quot; dictionary also calls &quot;maxian&quot; &quot;horse/giant millipede&quot; or &quot;juqu&quot; . According to Eberhard, centipedes were snake predators, and &quot;the enmity between snake and centipede occurs in many folktales and customs.&quot;

===Buddhist usages===
In Chinese Buddhist terminology, &quot;tianlong&quot; means either &quot;heavenly Nāgas (dragon gods)&quot; or &quot;Devas (heavenly gods) and Nāgas&quot;.

First, &quot;tianlong&quot; means &quot;heavenly dragon/nāga&quot; as the first of four nāga classes in Mahayana tradition.
# &quot;Heavenly Nāgas&quot; (), who guard the Heavenly Palace and carry it so that it does not fall.
# &quot;Divine Nāgas&quot; (), who benefit mankind by causing the clouds to rise and the rain to fall.
# &quot;Earthly Nāgas&quot; () who drain off rivers (remove the obstructions) and open sluices (outlets).
# &quot;Nāgas who are lying hidden&quot; () who guard the treasures of the &quot;Cakravartin&quot; () and blesses mankind.

Hangzhou Tianlong &quot;Heavenly Dragon from Hangzhou&quot; was a 9th-century Chan Buddhist master who enlightened Juzhi Yizhi by holding up one finger. The &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; (tr. Cleary 1977:123-8) calls this &quot;Chu Ti&#x27;s One-Finger Ch&#x27;an&quot; kōan.
Second, &quot;tianlong&quot; translates Sanskrit &quot;deva-nāga&quot; &quot;Devas and Nāgas&quot;, the 2 highest categories of the &quot;Tianlong Babu&quot; &quot;8 kinds of beings that protect the Dharma&quot;. The lower 6 categories are &quot;yecha&quot; &quot;Yaksha; cannibalistic devils; nature spirits&quot;, &quot;gantapo&quot; &quot;Gandharva; half-ghost music masters&quot;, &quot;axiuluo&quot; &quot;Asura; evil and violent demigods&quot;, &quot;jialouluo&quot; &quot;Garuda; golden bird-like demons that eat dragons&quot;, &quot;jinnaluo&quot; &quot;Kinnara; half-human half-bird celestial music masters&quot;, and &quot;maholuluojia&quot; &quot;Mahoraga; earthly snake spirits&quot;.

&quot;Tianlong Babu&quot; is also the title of a 1963 wuxia novel by Jin Yong, translated as English &quot;Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils&quot;. This Chinese title is further used by movies, television series, and a Massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

===Proper names===
Tianlong is a common name in Standard Chinese. Tianlongshan &quot;Heavenly Dragon Mountain&quot;, which is located near Taiyuan in Shanxi, is famous for the Tianlongshan Shiku Grottoes (). The commercial name Tianlong &quot;Heavenly Dragon&quot; is used by companies, hotels, and gungfu schools.
Japanese &quot;Tenryū&quot; or , a loanword from Chinese &quot;Tianlong&quot;, is a comparable proper name. A famous example is &quot;Tenryū-ji&quot; &quot;Heavenly Dragon Temple&quot; in Kyoto, which is headquarters of the Tenryū-ji Branch of the Rinzai sect. Tenryū place names include a waterway (Tenryū River ), a city (Tenryū, Shizuoka ), and a village (Tenryū, Nagano ). Further examples include Imperial Japanese Navy names (Japanese cruiser &quot;Tenryū&quot; ), and personal names (Genichiro Tenryu , a wrestler).

<doc id="314539" wikidata="Q893159" url="?curid=314539" title="Bootle">
<text>Bootle (pronounced ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England, which had a population of 51,394 in 2011; the wider Parliamentary constituency had a population of 98,449. It is part of the Liverpool City Region.

Historically part of Lancashire, Bootle&#x27;s proximity to the Irish Sea and the industrial city of Liverpool to the south saw it grow rapidly in the 1800s, first as a dormitory town for wealthy merchants, and then as a centre of commerce and industry in its own right following the arrival of the railway and the expansion of the docks and shipping industries. The subsequent population increase was fuelled heavily by Irish migration.

The town was heavily damaged in World War II with air raids against the port and other industrial targets. Post-war economic success in the 1950s and 1960s gave way to a downturn, precipitated by a reduction in the significance of Liverpool Docks internationally, and changing levels of industrialisation, coupled with the development of modern suburbs and the expansion of industries into the Merseyside hinterlands. By the 1980s, there had been a sharp spike in unemployment and population decline. Large-scale renewal projects have begun to help regenerate the local economy.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Etymologically, Bootle derives from the Anglo Saxon &quot;Bold&quot; or &quot;Botle&quot; meaning a dwelling.
It was recorded as &quot;Boltelai&quot; in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; in 1086. By 1212 the spelling had been recorded as &quot;Botle&quot;. The spellings &quot;Botull&quot;, &quot;Bothull&quot; and &quot;Bothell&quot; are recorded in the 14th century. In the 18th century, it was known as Bootle cum Linacre.

===Resort===
Bootle was originally a small hamlet built near the &#x27;sand hills&#x27; or dunes of the river estuary. In the early 19th century, it began to develop as a bathing resort, attracting wealthy people from Liverpool. Some remaining large villas which housed well-to-do commuters to Liverpool are located in the area known locally as &#x27;Bootle Village&#x27;, centred around Marsh Lane.

===Development===
The Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway arrived in the 1840s and Bootle experienced rapid growth. By the end of the 19th century the docks had been constructed along the whole of the river front as far as Seaforth Sands to the north. The town became heavily industrialised. Fearful of annexation by Liverpool, Bootle was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1868 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and in 1889 was granted the status of a county borough by the Local Government Act 1888, becoming independent from the administrative county of Lancashire. During this time period it was sometimes formally known as &quot;Bootle-cum-Linacre&quot;. Orrell was added to the borough in 1905. There are still large areas of Victorian terraced houses in Bootle, formerly occupied by dock workers. These are built in distinctive pressed red brick.

Bootle Town Hall and other municipal buildings were erected in the last quarter of the 19th century. The population of the town swelled during this period, boosted in large part by Irish immigration and the attraction of plentiful work on the docks. The wealth to pay for the splendour of the town hall and the gentrified &#x27;Bootle Village&#x27; area was generated by these docks. The skilled workers lived in terraced houses in the east of the town, while the casual dock labourers lived in cramped, dwellings near the dockside. Stories about three streets in particular, Raleigh Street, Dundas Street and Lyons Street, caused great alarm. Lyons Street, the scene of the &#x27;Teapot Murder&#x27;, was renamed Beresford Street shortly before the First World War.

Bootle was the first borough to elect its own school board, following the passage of William Forster&#x27;s Elementary Education Act 1870. In 1872 Dr R.J. Sprakeling was appointed the first Medical Officer of Health, and was instrumental in improving sanitary conditions in the town. The Metropole Theatre on Stanley Road played host to stars such as music hall singer Marie Lloyd. Tree lined streets surrounded magnificent open spaces, such as Derby Park, North Park and South Park. Roman Catholic and Anglican churches sprang up all over the town, and Welsh immigration brought with it Nonconformist chapels and the temperance movement. Local societies thrived, including sports teams, scouts and musical groups. The Bootle May Day carnival and the crowning of the May Queen were highlights of the social year. The town successfully fought against absorption by neighbouring Liverpool in 1903. It subsequently made good use of its Latin motto &quot;Respice, Aspice, Prospice&quot;, (&quot;look to the past, the present, the future&quot;).

===Second World War===
The docks made Bootle a target for Nazi German Luftwaffe bombers during the Liverpool Blitz of the Second World War, with approximately 90% of the houses in the town damaged.
Situated immediately adjoining the city of Liverpool, and the site of numerous docks, Bootle had the distinction of being the most heavily bombed borough in the UK, with 458 civilian deaths from enemy action recorded within the borough. Bootle played an important role in the Battle of the Atlantic. 

Royal Navy&#x27;s Captain Frederic John Walker, the famous U-boat hunter, would rest in the Mayor&#x27;s Parlour of Bootle Town Hall and his ships, HMS &quot;Stork&quot; and HMS &quot;Starling&quot;, sailed out of Gladstone Dock Bootle. Memorabilia associated with Walker including the ships&#x27;s bell from HMS &quot;Starling&quot; which was presented to Bootle County Borough Council on 21 October 1964 by Admiral Sir Nigel Henderson Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. can be viewed in Bootle Town Hall.

===Post-war===
After the Second World War large council housing estates were built inland from the town centre, including the area of Netherton, which was built on new town principles. The Liverpool Overhead Railway and Liverpool Tramways Company closure in the 1950s reduced Bootle&#x27;s connection to Liverpool.

Bootle did share in the postwar boom. The centre of the town was redeveloped and the &#x27;Bootle New Strand&#x27; shopping centre was opened in 1968. At the same time, new offices were built in the town centre. The town lost its access to the beach when neighbouring Seaforth Sands was redeveloped in the early 1970s, but the Seaforth Container Port brought new jobs into the area. The local authority, and other &#x27;social&#x27; landlords, saw to it that new housing was built and older stock renovated. Bootle did not go down the route of massive housing clearance, and many local communities remained intact.

The borough celebrated its centenary in 1968 and civic pride was much in evidence.

===Decline===
The docks declined in importance in the 1960s and 1970s, and Bootle suffered high unemployment and a declining population. The establishment of large office blocks housing government departments and the National Girobank provided employment, filled largely by middle-class people from outside the Bootle/Liverpool area. In the early 1970s Bootle was absorbed into the new local authority of Sefton under local government reorganisation. More fundamental than political change was economic change. The very reason for Bootle&#x27;s existence, the access to the Mersey, became almost irrelevant as the docks closed and the new container port required far fewer workers than the old docks had. This in turn affected practically every other industry in the town. The problems slowly gathered pace until Merseyside hit crisis point in the early 1980s. Even by 2006 the area was one of the poorest in the country and had high levels of unemployment.

===Regeneration===
Asda heavily invested in Bootle by building a new eco-friendly superstore on Strand Road in 2008. Among refurbishment and rebuilding projects in the 2010s, the HSE buildings and the new-look Stanley Road have been created, Oriel Road Station has been refurbished, and a new block of flats on the site of the Stella Maris building and a Lidl store on Stanley Road have been built. The Klondyke Estate located off Hawthorne road saw the Welsh terrace houses get demolished and replaced with 2,3 and 4 bed modern houses. This was after the controversial move by Bellway after residents opposed demolition. Sefton Council submitted a bid to the Government&#x27;s Levelling UP Fund in July for £20 million to underpin a regeneration scheme to transform Bootle town centre. The outcome of the fund is expected to be announced in 2023. In March 2023, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced, as part of the Spring Budget, a £58 million fund for &quot;Capital Levelling Up&quot;, of which £20 million has been allocated to the first phase of repurposing the Strand shopping centre and wider transformation of Bootle Town Centre.

In November 2016, Liverpool2 was opened, expanding Seaforth Docks with river berths that can accommodate large container ships.
===Unemployment===
The economic recovery on Merseyside since the 1980s has meant that Bootle is ranked as only the tenth worst area for unemployment in Britain, and all other parts of the region have lower unemployment—a stark contrast to the 1970s and 1980s when areas of Merseyside dominated the list of Britain&#x27;s least economically active areas. As of 2009, in the depth of a recession, unemployment stood at 12%. In 2022, it was reduced to less than 4%, similar to the national average.

==Geography and administration==
Bootle Docks was created as a part of the Mersey Docks and now promoted as Port of Liverpool, with the Liverpool and Wirral Docks, being located on both bank sides of the River Mersey. Bootle Docks are situated at the northern end, that is closer to the Irish Sea estuary.

Bootle, along with Southport, is one of the two main administrative headquarters for the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton. Among Bootle&#x27;s neighbouring districts are Kirkdale to the south, Walton to the east, with Seaforth, Litherland and Netherton to the north. To the west it is bounded by the River Mersey. In the centre is a sizeable area of large office blocks, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

The old civic centre of Bootle contains large Victorian buildings such as the town hall and the municipal baths. To the north lies the New Strand Shopping Centre, which gained notoriety after the abduction and murder of two-year-old James Bulger in 1993.

==Sport and Leisure==
===Football===
Bootle has one association football non-league team known as Bootle F.C. who currently play in the Northern Premier League Division One West. They are a reformed version of the original Bootle F.C. (1879).

===Cricket===
Bootle Cricket Club was founded in 1933 and they incorporated Firwood into the club&#x27;s name in the 1990s. Their main ground is on Wadham Road. Firwood Bootle CC has a significant success record, with 6 Liverpool and District Cricket Competition championship titles to their name.
Bootle field three senior teams that compete in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition and they have an established junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Liverpool Competition Junior League.

==Education==
The town has one further education college, Hugh Baird College, located on Balliol Road. The college delivers over 300 courses to more than 7,000 students with course levels from Entry Level to Level 3, A Levels, apprenticeships and university level courses and degrees.

In January 2014, a multimillion-pound facility called the L20 Building located on Stanley Road was opened. This houses a dedicated University Centre with open-plan study areas for students studying University level courses.

==Transport==

There are two railway stations served by frequent electric services from Liverpool to Southport. These are Oriel Road near the Victorian era civic centre, and New Strand, serving the shopping centre. A third railway station is situated on the boundary of Bootle (Old Roan), and is part of the Liverpool to Ormskirk Line. A goods line, the Bootle Branch, is still in use, but it used to be a passenger line which had a station at Bootle Balliol Road railway station and served the areas of Clubmoor, Tuebrook and Childwall among other places. It closed during the 1960s. Called the Canada Dock Branch, a second route, the North Mersey Branch could still be opened.

The bus station is under the New Strand Shopping Centre and provides services to Liverpool City Centre, Penny Lane, Allerton, Tuebrook and Crosby.

Bootle Docks used to host passenger ships to Belfast and Dublin, but now it is used solely for freight services, and it is somewhat less important than the port of Liverpool.

==Amenities==
The town has a leisure centre, located in the North Park area, which includes a modern gym, swimming pool, and various indoor sports halls. The Bootle New Strand shopping centre contains many of the regular high street stores, combined with a smaller collection of local businesses. For entertainment there is a wide variety of public houses, snooker clubs and late-night bars. There are also a number of restaurants.

==Politics==
Originally a Conservative seat, Bootle elected early MPs such as Bonar Law, a future Tory Prime Minister. The seat was briefly Liberal in the early 1920s. Labour first captured the seat in 1929, in the personage of local hairdresser John Kinley, but lost it in 1931. Although Kinley recaptured it in 1945 it did not become safely Labour until the long tenure of Simon Mahon. It is now impregnable, politically, and since 1997 the Bootle constituency has been one of the safest Labour Party seats in the whole of the United Kingdom. The area was represented in parliament by Joe Benton until he stood down in 2015. The current MP is Peter Dowd.

For elections to Sefton Council the town of Bootle is split between the electoral wards of Netherton and Orrell, whose three representatives, are all members of the Labour Party, and are Susan Ellen Bradshaw, Ian Ralph Maher and Tom Spring. Derby, whose three representatives are Brenda O&#x27;Brien, David Robinson and Anne Thompson and are all members of the Labour Party, and finally Linacre whose three representatives, are all members of the Labour Party, and are John Fairclough, Christine Maher, and Daniel McKee. Overall there are nine councillors representing the Bootle area, all of them are members of the Labour Party.
Overall the electoral wards of Sefton Council in and around Bootle and the parliamentary constituency itself are extremely safe seats for the Labour Party, sometimes standing uncontested by the other parties.

==Notable people==

Many notable footballers were born in Bootle. Jamie Carragher, Steve McManaman and Roy Evans came to prominence playing for Liverpool (with Evans later going on to become the club&#x27;s manager) whilst Alvin Martin is regarded as one of West Ham United&#x27;s greatest-ever players. Former Evertonian Jose Baxter of Sheffield United was also born in Bootle. England Lioness and Manchester City player Alex Greenwood grew up playing on the streets of Bootle.

In the arts, Bootle has produced the comedian Tom O&#x27;Connor, the television presenter Keith Chegwin, television producer and presenter Will Hanrahan and early rock and roll singer Billy J. Kramer. The fashion retailer George Davies was educated in Bootle.

<doc id="314540" wikidata="Q252798" url="?curid=314540" title="Peter the Fuller">
<text>Peter the Fuller was Patriarch of Antioch (471–488) and a Non-Chalcedonian.

Peter received his surname from his former trade as a fuller of cloth. Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont (&quot;Empereurs&quot;, tome vi, p. 404) considers that Peter was originally a member of the convent of the Akoimetoi, which he places in Bithynia on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, at Gomon, &quot;The Great Monastery&quot; and being expelled thence for his behavior and heretical doctrine, passed over to Constantinople, where he courted persons of influence, through whom he was introduced to Zeno, the son-in-law of Leo I (457–474) and future emperor (474–491), whose favor he secured, obtaining through him the chief place in the church of St. Bassa, at Chalcedon. Here his Non-Chalcedonian beliefs quickly became apparent, resulting with his flight to Zeno, who was then setting out for Antioch as commander of the East (Magister Militum per Orientem).

Arriving at Antioch in 463, Peter greatly desired the patriarchal throne, then filled by Martyrius of Antioch. He quickly befriended the populace, with whom he raised suspicions against Martyrius as a concealed Nestorian, thus causing Martyrius&#x27; tumultuous expulsion and his own election to the throne. Theodorus Lector dates this to 469 or 470.

When established as patriarch, Peter II at once declared himself openly against the Council of Chalcedon and added to the Trisagion the words &quot;Who was crucified for us&quot;, which he imposed as a test upon all in his patriarchate, anathematising those who declined to accept it. According to the Synodicon, he summoned a council at Antioch to give synodical authority to this novel clause (Labbe, iv, 1009). The deposed Martyrius went to Constantinople to complain to Emperor Leo I, by whom, through the influence of the Patriarch Gennadius of Constantinople, he was courteously received; a council of bishops found in his favor, and his restoration was decreed (Theodorus Lector, p. 554). But despite the imperial authority, Peter II&#x27;s personal influence, supported by the favour of Zeno, was so great in Antioch that Martyrius&#x27;s position was rendered intolerable and he soon left Antioch, abandoning his throne again to the intruder. Leo I was naturally indignant at this audacious disregard of his commands, and he despatched an imperial decree for the deposition of Peter II and his banishment to the Oasis (Labbe, iv, 1082).

According to Theodorus Lector, Peter II fled, and Julian was unanimously elected bishop in his place (471), holding the see until Peter&#x27;s third restoration by Emperor Basiliscus in 476 (Theophanes the Confessor, p. 99). During the interval, Peter II dwelt at Constantinople, in retirement in the monastery of the Acoemetae, allowed to reside there in return for a pledge that he would not create further disturbances (Theophanes, p. 104). During the short reign of Basiliscus (January 475 – August 476) the fortunes of Peter II revived. Under the influence of his wife, Basiliscus advocated for the Non-Chalcedonians, recalled Timothy II of Alexandria, Patriarch of Alexandria, from exile, and by his persuasion issued an encyclical letter to the bishops calling them to anathematise the decrees of Chalcedon (Evagr. H. E., iii, 4). Peter II gladly complied, and was rewarded by a third restoration to the see of Antioch, 476 (ib. 5). Julian was deposed, dying not long after.

On his restoration Peter II enforced the addition to the Trisagion, and behaved with great zeal against the Chalcedonian party, crushing all opposition by an appeal to the Syrian people, whom he had gained control over. Once established on the patriarchal throne, he was not slow to stretch its privileges to the widest extent, ordaining bishops and metropolitans for all of Syria. The fall of Basiliscus brought the ruin of all who had supported him and been promoted by him, and Peter was one of the first to fall.

In 485 Peter II again was placed on the throne of Antioch by Zeno on his signing the Henoticon (Theophanes, p. 115; Theodorus Lector, p. 569; Evagr. H. E., iii, 16). He at once resumed his zealous career, expelling Chalcedonian bishops who refused to sign the Henoticon and performing ordinations not recognised by Chalcedonians, especially that of the Xenaias (Philoxenus of Mabbug) to the see of Hierapolis (Theophanes, p. 115). He was condemned and anathematised by a synod of 42 Western bishops at Rome 485 and excommunicated. He retained, however, the patriarchate at Antioch till his death in 488 (or according to Theophanes, 490 or 491). One of his last acts was the unsuccessful revival of the claim of the see of Antioch to the obedience of Cyprus as part of the patriarchate, which the First Council of Ephesus had removed from Antioch&#x27;s supervision in 431.

<text>Captain Sir Alexander Burnes (16 May 1805 – 2 November 1841) was a Scottish explorer, military officer and diplomat associated with the Great Game. He was nicknamed Bokhara Burnes for his role in establishing contact with and exploring Bukhara. His memoir, &quot;Travels into Bokhara&quot;, was a bestseller when it was first published in 1835.

==Early life==

Burnes was born on 16 May 1805 in Montrose, Scotland, as the fourth son of James Burnes (1780–1852) the local provost, who was first cousin to the poet Robert Burns. His brother was the doctor and surgeon James Burnes.

At the age of sixteen, Alexander joined the army of the East India Company and while serving in India, he learned Urdu and Persian, and obtained an appointment as an interpreter at Surat in 1822.

He was transferred to Kutch in 1826 where he was based at Bhuj for three years. As assistant to the political agent, he took an interest in the history and geography of north-western India and the adjacent countries, which had not yet been thoroughly explored by the British; he then went to Afghanistan.

==Exploration==

Afghanistan, one of the most remote kingdoms in the world, found itself sandwiched between the rival British and Russian empires. British control in India made the Russians suspect an intention to move northwards through Afghanistan; conversely, the British feared that India was sought by Russia. Sensing the two empires would collide in Afghanistan, the British Government needed intelligence and dispatched Burnes to get it. In 1831, travelling in disguise, Burnes surveyed the route through Kabul to Bukhara and produced the first detailed accounts of Afghan politics.

His proposal in 1829 to undertake a journey of exploration through the valley of the Indus River was approved and in 1831 his and Henry Pottinger&#x27;s surveys of the Indus river would prepare the way for a future assault on the Sindh to clear a path towards Central Asia.

In the same year he arrived in Lahore with a present of horses from King William IV to Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The British claimed that the horses would not survive the overland journey, so they were allowed to transport the horses up the Indus and used the opportunity to secretly survey the river. Despite pressure from his superiors, Burnes declined a military escort on his journey up the Indus, fearing their presence would cause the native population to conclude the British intended to mount an invasion. Instead, Burnes travelled with only one other British officer, Ensign J.D. Leckie, and periodically enlisted members of native communities to man and navigate his convoy. In so doing, Burnes developed close bonds with local leaders and governors in cities along the Indus. His immense skills in diplomacy and knowledge of local customs and rites of flattery enabled him to travel through areas of the Indus previously closed to Europeans, including Thatta, Hyderabad, Bukkur, and Shujabad, among others.

In October 1831, Burnes coordinated the first meeting of Maharaja Ranjit Singh with a sitting commander of British forces in India, Governor General Lord William Bentinck. The assembly took place in the village of Rupur (present day Rupnagar) on the banks of the Sutlej from 22 to 26 October. The event was attended by numerous British political attachés and subalterns including Bentinck, General John Ramsay, and H.T. Prinsep. The event was also marked by the Maharajah&#x27;s open display of the celebrated Koh-i-Noor diamond, which he presented for free inspection by the British attendees (the jewel would eventually come into the possession of the British royal family, and set in the Crown of Queen Alexandra).
Following the Rupur summit, Burnes took up brief residence in Delhi from November to December 1831. It was in Delhi that, on 19 December, Burnes first made contact with his future travelling partner Mohan Lal. While visiting a Hindu school in the grounds of Humayun&#x27;s Tomb, Burnes witnessed a recitation by Lal on the dismemberment of Poland, and was so impressed with the young boy&#x27;s knowledge of western geography, he invited Lal to travel with him to Tartary. From Delhi, Burnes then travelled to Ludhiana where he received permission to proceed in his travels into Central Asia.

In the following years, in company with Mohan Lal, his travels continued through Afghanistan across the Hindu Kush to Bukhara (in what is modern Uzbekistan) and Persia.

The narrative which he published on his visit to England in 1834 added immensely to contemporary knowledge of these countries, and was one of the most popular books of the time. It was republished in 2012. The first edition earned the author £800, and his services were recognised not only by the Royal Geographical Society of London, but also by that of Paris. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society the same year. London&#x27;s prestigious Athenaeum Club admitted him without ballot. Soon after his return to India in 1835 he was appointed to the court of Sindh to secure a treaty for the navigation of the Indus and in 1836 he undertook a political mission to Dost Mohammed Khan at Kabul.

== First Anglo-Afghan War ==
He advised Lord Auckland to support Dost Mohammed on the throne of Kabul, but the viceroy preferred to follow the opinion of Sir William Hay Macnaghten and reinstated Shah Shuja, thus leading to the outbreak of the First Anglo-Afghan War. On the restoration of Shah Shuja in 1839, Burnes became regular political agent at Kabul. He was knighted by Queen Victoria on 6 August 1838, while serving in the 21st India Native Infantry on a mission in Afghanistan, and remained there until his assassination in 1841, during an insurrection in which his younger brother, Charles, was also killed. The calmness with which he continued at his post despite the threat to his life, and after the death of his political assistant Major William Broadfoot, won him a heroic reputation.

It came to light in 1860 that some of Burnes&#x27;s dispatches from Kabul in 1839 had been altered to convey opinions that had not been his, but Lord Palmerston refused after so long to grant the inquiry demanded in the House of Commons. An account of his later labours was published in 1842 under the title of &quot;Cabool: A Personal Narrative of a Journey to, and Residence in that City, in the Years 1836, 7, and 8&quot;.

==Final months and death==
On 7 August 1839, the British Government restored Afghan leader Shah Shuja to the throne in Kabul after an exile of over thirty years. Shujah had been living as a pensioner of the crown for the entirety of his exile. He was considered to be the candidate most complacent and willing to cooperate with British interests in the region.

Burnes, having long considered Shujah unfit to rule, had implored then Governor General Lord Auckland to endorse Dost Mohammad Khan to accede to the throne. His recommendations went unheeded and, on 3 November 1840, Dost Mohammad surrendered himself to British forces, going into exile in India. Despite his hesitation in endorsing Shujah; Burnes, along with Sir William Hay Macnaghten, 1st Baronet, was installed in Kabul as resident political officers, a position Burnes himself resented, calling himself &quot;a highly paid idler&quot;. 

In Kabul, the reign of Shah Shuja was marked by tyranny and widespread poverty among the Afghan people. Shuja announced that he considered his own people to be &quot;dogs&quot; who needed to be taught to be obedient to their master, and spent his time exacting bloody vengeance on those Afghans who he felt had betrayed him.

At the same time, large numbers of British officers, their wives, children, and staff, had relocated to Kabul for the favourable temperatures, having previously been stationed in the hot, dry plains of Hindustan. The British influx brought with it numerous foreign customs such as cricket, skating, and steeplechase. The sudden swelling of the city&#x27;s population caused prices for food and goods in the bazaars to skyrocket. At the same time, Shujah had greatly increased taxation on the population, leading to a large scale economic depression among the lower class.

At the urging of Shah Shuja, the British and Indian troops had agreed to relocate their encampment out of the city walls, setting up a series of cantonments outside the city. Burnes however, chose to remain within the heart of the old city, taking up residence in a walled house with a handful of other senior officers including his brother Lieutenant Charles Burnes, and Major William Broadfoot.

On 1 November 1841, Burnes was approached by his former travelling companion Mohan Lal who informed Burnes of a plot to have him killed, urging him to flee the city for the relative safety of the cantonment. As the representative of Britain in Kabul, it was Burnes whom many Afghans considered responsible for the city&#x27;s financial and religious decay. Confident he could quell any potential trouble, Burnes decided to stay in Kabul against his friend&#x27;s advice. That night, a small group of men began driving up a mob around the city. The group was originally a small contingent directly opposed to Burnes&#x27;s presence. They managed to swell their numbers by spreading the message that the building adjacent to Burnes&#x27;s house was used as the garrison treasury, holding pay for the entire British forces in Kabul.

By nightfall, a large mob had assembled within the courtyard of Burnes&#x27;s house. Burnes sent a runner to the cantonments asking for immediate assistance, before stepping out onto his balcony to attempt to reason with the crowd. Reportedly, assistance from the British army was delayed by a series of internal arguments between senior officers there on how best to respond to the threat.

The situation with the rioters continued to deteriorate as they set fire to the compound stables. A single shot was fired from the crowd and Major Broadfoot, standing beside Burnes on the balcony, was killed. Now assured that there was no longer a chance for rescue, Charles Burnes exited, armed, into the courtyard, reportedly killing six men before being hacked to death. Alexander Burnes was soon beaten and hacked to death by the mob. The events took place just half an hour&#x27;s march from where the British troops had been stationed. One young officer, recording the event in his journal, noted &quot;When 300 men would have been sufficient in the morning, 3000 would not have been adequate in the afternoon.&quot;

==Legacy==
He is commemorated in the name of the rufous-vented grass babbler &quot;Laticilla burnesii&quot;.

<doc id="314544" wikidata="Q868261" url="?curid=314544" title="Black Monday (1987)">
<text>Black Monday (also known as Black Tuesday in some parts of the world due to time zone differences) was a global, severe and largely unexpected stock market crash on Monday, October 19, 1987. Worldwide losses were estimated at US$1.71 trillion. The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended economic instability or even a reprise of the Great Depression.

Possible explanations for the initial fall in stock prices include a nervous fear that stocks were significantly overvalued and were certain to undergo a correction, persistent US trade and budget deficits, and rising interest rates. Another explanation for Black Monday comes from the decline of the dollar, followed by a lack of faith in governmental attempts to stop that decline. In February 1987, leading industrial countries had signed the Louvre Accord, hoping that monetary policy coordination would stabilize international money markets, but doubts about the viability of the accord created a crisis of confidence. The fall may have been accelerated by portfolio insurance hedging (using computer-based models to buy or sell index futures in various stock market conditions) or a self-reinforcing contagion of fear.

The degree to which the stock market crashes spread to the wider (or &quot;real&quot;) economy was directly related to the monetary policy each nation pursued in response. The central banks of the United States, West Germany, and Japan provided market liquidity to prevent debt defaults among financial institutions, and the impact on the real economy was relatively limited and short-lived. However, refusal to loosen monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had sharply negative and relatively long-term consequences for both its financial markets and real economy.

==United States==
===Background===
During a strong five-year bull market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose from 776 in August 1982 to a peak of 2,722 in August 1987. The same bullish trend propelled market indices around the world over this period, as the nineteen largest enjoyed an average rise of 296 percent.

On the morning of Wednesday, October 14, 1987, the United States House Committee on Ways and Means introduced a bill to reduce the tax benefits associated with financing mergers and leveraged buyouts. Unexpectedly high trade deficit figures announced on October 14 by the United States Department of Commerce had a further negative impact on the value of the US dollar while pushing interest rates upward and stock prices downward. As the day continued, the DJIA dropped 95.46 points (3.81 percent) to 2,412.70, and it fell another 57.61 points (2.39 percent) the next day, down over 12 percent from the August 25 all-time high. On Friday, October 16, the DJIA fell 108.35 points (4.6 percent). The drop on the 14th was the earliest significant decline among all countries that would later be affected by Black Monday.

Though the markets were closed for the weekend, significant selling pressure still existed. The computer models of portfolio insurers continued to dictate very large sales. Moreover, some large mutual fund groups had procedures that enabled customers to easily redeem their shares during the weekend at the same prices that existed at the close of market on Friday. The amount of these redemption requests was far greater than the firms&#x27; cash reserves, requiring them to make large sales of shares as soon as the market opened on the following Monday. Finally, some traders anticipated these pressures and tried to get ahead of the market by selling early and aggressively on Monday, before the anticipated price drop.

===The Crash===
Before the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opened on October 19, 1987, there was pent-up pressure to sell. When the market opened, a large imbalance arose between the volume of sell and buy orders, placing downward pressure on prices. Regulations at the time allowed designated market makers (or &quot;specialists&quot;) to delay or suspend trading in a stock if the order imbalance exceeded the specialist&#x27;s ability to fulfill in an orderly manner. The imbalance on October 19 was so large that 95 stocks on the S&amp;P 500 Index (S&amp;P) opened late, as also did 11 of the 30 DJIA stocks. Importantly, however, the futures market opened on time across the board, with heavy selling.

On that Monday, the DJIA fell 508 points (22.6 percent), accompanied by crashes in the futures exchanges and options markets, the largest one-day percentage drop in the history of the DJIA. The DJIA fell from 2,246.74 at the open to 1,738.74 at the close. Significant selling created steep price declines throughout the day, particularly during the last 90 minutes of trading. Deluged with sell orders, many stocks on the NYSE faced trading halts and delays. Of the 2,257 NYSE-listed stocks, there were 195 trading delays and halts that day. Total trading volume was so large that the computer and communications systems were overwhelmed, leaving orders unfilled for an hour or more. Large funds transfers were delayed and the Fedwire and NYSE SuperDot systems shut down for extended periods further compounding traders&#x27; confusion.

===Margin calls and liquidity===
Frederic Mishkin suggested that the greatest economic danger was not events on the day of the crash itself, but the potential for &quot;spreading collapse of securities firms&quot; if an extended liquidity crisis in the securities industry began to threaten the solvency and viability of brokerage houses and specialists. This possibility first loomed on the day after the crash. At least initially, there was a very real risk that these institutions could fail. If that happened, spillover effects could sweep over the entire financial system, with negative consequences for the real economy as a whole. As Robert R. Glauber stated, &quot;From our perspective on the Brady Commission, Black Monday may have been frightening, but it was the capital-liquidity problem on Tuesday that was horrifying.&quot;

The source of these liquidity problems was a general increase in margin calls; after the market&#x27;s plunge, these were about ten times their average size and three times greater than the highest previous levels. Several firms had insufficient cash in customers&#x27; accounts (that is, they were &quot;undersegregated&quot;). Firms drawing funds from their own capital to meet the shortfall sometimes became undercapitalized; 11 firms received margin calls for a single customer that exceeded that firm&#x27;s adjusted net capital, sometimes by as much as two-to-one. Investors needed to repay end-of-day margin calls made on October 19 before the opening of the market on October 20. Clearinghouse member firms called on lending institutions to extend credit to cover these sudden and unexpected charges, but the brokerages requesting additional credit began to exceed their credit limit. Banks were also worried about increasing their involvement and exposure to a chaotic market. The size and urgency of the demands for credit placed upon banks was unprecedented. In general, counterparty risk increased as the creditworthiness of counterparties and the value of collateral posted became highly uncertain.

===Federal Reserve response===
&quot;[T]he response of monetary policy to the crash,&quot; according to economist Michael Mussa, &quot;was massive, immediate and appropriate.&quot; One day after the crash, the Federal Reserve (Fed) began to act as the lender of last resort to counter the crisis. Its crisis management approach included issuing a terse, decisive public pronouncement; supplying liquidity through open market operations; persuading banks to lend to securities firms; and in a few specific cases, direct action tailored to a few firms&#x27; needs.

On the morning of October 20, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made a brief statement: &quot;The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the Nation&#x27;s central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system&quot;. Fed sources suggested that the brevity was deliberate, in order to avoid misinterpretations. This &quot;extraordinary&quot; announcement probably had a calming effect on markets that were facing an equally unprecedented demand for liquidity and the immediate potential for a liquidity crisis. The market rallied after that announcement, gaining around 200 points, but the rally was short-lived. By noon the gains had been erased and the slide had resumed.

The Fed then acted to provide market liquidity and prevent the crisis from expanding into other markets. It immediately began injecting its reserves into the financial system via purchases on the open market. On October 20 it injected $17 billion into the banking system through the open market – an amount that was more than 25 percent of bank reserve balances and 7 percent of the monetary base of the entire nation. This rapidly pushed the federal funds rate down by 0.5 percent. The Fed continued its expansive open market purchases of securities for weeks. The Fed also repeatedly began these interventions an hour before the regularly scheduled time, notifying dealers of the schedule change on the evening beforehand. This was all done in a very high-profile and public manner, similar to Greenspan&#x27;s initial announcement, to restore market confidence that liquidity was forthcoming. Although the Fed&#x27;s holdings expanded appreciably over time, the speed of expansion was not excessive. Moreover, the Fed later disposed of these holdings so that its long-term policy goals would not be adversely affected.

The Fed successfully met the unprecedented demands for credit by pairing a strategy of moral suasion that motivated nervous banks to lend to securities firms alongside its moves to reassure those banks by actively supplying them with liquidity. As economist Ben Bernanke (who was later to become Chairman of the Federal Reserve) wrote:

The Fed&#x27;s two-part strategy was thoroughly successful, since lending to securities firms by large banks in Chicago and especially in New York increased substantially, often nearly doubling.

==International ==
All of the twenty-three major world markets experienced a sharp decline in October 1987. Stock markets crashed worldwide, first in Asian markets other than Japan, then Europe, then the US, and finally Japan. When measured in United States dollars, eight markets declined by 20 to 29 percent, three by 30 to 39 percent (Malaysia, Mexico and New Zealand), and three by more than 40 percent (Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore). The least affected was Austria (a fall of 11.4 percent) while the most affected was Hong Kong with a drop of 45.8 percent. Out of twenty-three major industrial countries, nineteen had a decline greater than 20 percent. Worldwide losses were estimated at US$1.71 trillion. The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended economic instability or even a reprise of the Great Depression.
===United Kingdom===

On Friday, October 16, all the markets in London were unexpectedly closed due to the Great Storm of 1987. After they re-opened, the speed of the crash accelerated. By midday, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100) had fallen 296 points, a 14 percent drop. It was down 23 percent in two days, roughly the same percentage that the NYSE dropped on the day of the crash. Stocks then continued to fall, albeit at a less precipitous rate, until reaching a trough in mid-November at 36 percent below its pre-crash peak. Stocks did not begin to recover until 1989.

In Japan, the October 1987 crash is sometimes referred to as &quot;Blue Tuesday&quot;, because of the time zone difference, and its effects were relatively mild. According to economist Ulrike Schaede, the initial market break was severe: the Tokyo market declined 14.9 percent in one day, and Japan&#x27;s losses of US$421 billion ranked next to New York&#x27;s $500 billion, out of a worldwide total loss of $1.7 trillion. However, systemic differences between the US and Japanese financial systems led to significantly different outcomes during and after the crash on Tuesday, October 20. In Japan the ensuing panic was no more than mild at worst: the Nikkei 225 Index returned to its pre-crash levels after only five months. Other global markets performed less well in the aftermath of the crash, with New York, London and Frankfurt all needing more than a year to achieve the same level of recovery.

Several of Japan&#x27;s distinctive institutional characteristics already in place at the time, according to economist David D. Hale, helped dampen volatility. These included trading curbs such as a sharp limit on price movements of a share of more than 10 to 15 percent; restrictions and institutional barriers to short-selling by domestic and international traders; frequent adjustments of margin requirements in response to changes in volatility; strict guidelines on mutual fund redemptions; and actions of the Ministry of Finance to control the total shares of stock and exert moral suasion on the securities industry. An example of the latter occurred when the ministry invited representatives of the four largest securities firms to tea in the early afternoon of the day of the crash. After their visit to the ministry, these firms made large purchases of stock in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.

===Hong Kong===

The worst decline among world markets was in Hong Kong, where share values dropped by 45.8 percent. In its biggest-ever single fall, the Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 420.81 points, eliminating HK$65 billion&#x27; (10 percent) of its share value. Noting the continued fall of New York markets on their next trading day and fearing steep drops or total collapse of their own exchanges, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Committee and the committee of the Futures Exchange announced the following morning that both would be closed. Their closure lasted for four working days. Their decision was motivated in part by the high risk that a market collapse would have serious consequences for the entire financial system of Hong Kong, and perhaps result in rioting, with the added threat of intervention by the army of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. According to Neil Gunningham, a further motivation was brought on by a significant conflict of interest: many of these committee members were themselves futures brokers, and their firms were in danger of substantial defaults from their clients.

Although the stock exchange was in distress, structural flaws in the futures exchange, which was then the world&#x27;s most heavily traded outside the U.S., were at the heart of the greater financial crisis. The structure of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange differed greatly from many other exchanges around the world. In many countries, large institutional investors dominate the market. Their principal motivation for futures transactions is hedging. In Hong Kong, the market itself, as well as many of its traders and brokers, was inexperienced. It was composed heavily of small, local investors who were relatively uninformed and unsophisticated, had only a short-term commitment to the market, and whose goals were primarily speculative rather than hedging. Among all parties involved, there was little or no expectation of the possibility of a crash or a steep decline or understanding of the consequences of such a fall. In fact, speculative investing that depended on the bull market to continue was prevalent among individual investors, often including the brokers themselves.

The key shortcomings of the futures exchange, however, were mismanagement and a failure of regulatory diligence and design. These failures were particularly grave in the area of credit control. In Hong Kong, the approach to credit involved a system of margins and margin calls plus a Guarantee Corporation backed by a guarantee fund. Although on paper the Hong Kong exchange&#x27;s margin requirements were in line with those of other major markets, in practice brokers regularly extended credit with little regard for risk. In a lax, freewheeling and fiercely competitive environment, margin requirements were routinely cut in half and sometimes ignored altogether. Hong Kong also had no suitability requirements that would force brokers to screen their customers for ability to repay any debts. The absence of oversight creates an imbalance of risk due to moral hazard: it becomes profitable for traders with low cash reserves to speculate in futures, reaping benefits if they speculate correctly, but simply defaulting if their hunches are wrong. If there is a wave of dishonored contracts, brokers become liable for their clients&#x27; losses, potentially facing bankruptcy themselves.
Finally, the Guarantee Corporation was severely underfunded, with capital on hand of only HK$15 million (US$2 million). That amount was inadequate for dealing with any large number of clients&#x27; defaults in a market trading around 14,000 contracts a day, with an underlying value of HK$4.3 billion.

The crash initially left about 36,400 contracts worth HK$6.7 billion [US$1 billion] outstanding. As late as April 1988, HK$800 million had not been settled. According to Neil Gunningham, the accumulative impact was nearly fatal to the Hong Kong futures market: &quot;Whereas futures exchanges elsewhere [in the world] emerged from the crash with only minor casualties, the crisis in Hong Kong has resulted, at least in the short term, in the virtual demolition of the Futures Exchange.&quot; Finally, in the interest of preserving political stability and public order, the then British colonial government was forced to rescue the Guarantee Fund by providing a bail-out package of HK$4 billion.

===New Zealand===

The crash of the New Zealand stock market was notably long and deep, continuing its decline for an extended period after other global markets had recovered. Unlike other nations, moreover, for New Zealand the effects of the October 1987 crash spilled over into its real economy, contributing to a prolonged recession.

The effects of the worldwide economic boom of the mid-1980s had been amplified in New Zealand by the relaxation of foreign exchange controls and a wave of banking deregulation. Deregulation in particular suddenly gave financial institutions considerably more freedom to lend, though they had little experience in doing so. The finance industry was in a state of increasing optimism that approached euphoria. This created an atmosphere conducive to greater financial risk taking including increased speculation in the stock market and real estate. Foreign investors participated, attracted by New Zealand&#x27;s relatively high interest rates. From late 1984 until Black Monday, commercial property prices and commercial construction rose sharply, while share prices in the stock market tripled.

New Zealand&#x27;s stock market fell nearly 15 percent on the first day. In the following three-and-a-half months, the value of its market shares was cut in half. By the time it reached its trough in February 1988, the market had lost 60 percent of its value. The financial crisis triggered a wave of deleveraging with significant macro-economic consequences. Investment companies and property developers began a fire sale of their properties, partially to help offset their share price losses, and partially because the crash had exposed overbuilding. Moreover, these firms had been using property as collateral for their increased borrowing. When property values collapsed, the health of balance sheets of lending institutions was damaged.

Holding onto a disinflationary stance, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand declined to loosen monetary policy – which would have helped firms settle their obligations and remain in operation. As the harmful effects spread over the next few years, major corporations and financial institutions went out of business, and the banking systems of New Zealand and Australia were impaired, contributing to a &quot;long recession&quot;. Access to credit was reduced. In fact, because of legislation requiring the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to achieve an inflation rate no higher than 2 percent by 1993, interest rates were volatile, with multiple increases. The combination of these contributed significantly to a long recession running from 1987 until 1993.

==Causes==
Discussions of the causes of the Black Monday crash focus on two theoretical models, which differ in whether they emphasise on variables that are exogenous or endogenous. The first searches for exogenous factors, such as significant news events, that affect or &quot;trigger&quot; investor behavior. The second, &quot;cascade theory&quot; or &quot;market meltdown&quot;, attempts to identify endogenous internal market dynamics and interactions of systemic variables or trading strategies such that an order imbalance leads to a price change, this price change in turn leads to further order imbalance, which leads to further price changes, and so on in a spiralling cascade. It is possible that both could occur, if a trigger sets off a cascade.

===Market forces===
Several events have been cited as potential triggers for the initial fall in stock prices. One of these was a proposed tax change that would make corporate takeovers more costly. However, Nobel-prize winning economist Robert J. Shiller surveyed 889 investors (605 individual investors and 284 institutional investors) immediately after the crash regarding several aspects of their experience at the time. Only three institutional investors and no individual investors reported a belief that the news regarding proposed tax legislation was a trigger for the crash.

Other factors often cited include a general feeling that stocks were overvalued and were certain to undergo a correction, the decline of the dollar, persistent trade and budget deficits, and rising interest rates. According to Shiller, the most common responses to his survey were related to a general mindset of investors at the time: a &quot;gut feeling&quot; of an impending crash, perhaps driven by excessive debt. This aligns with an account suggested by economist Martin Feldstein, who has made the argument that several of these institutional and market factors exerted pressure in an environment of general anxiety. Feldstein suggests that the stock market was in a speculative bubble that kept prices &quot;too high by historic and sustainable standards&quot;. The real economy was doing well, profits and earnings were rising, but stock prices were rising faster than the underlying profits would warrant. These capital gains created high price-earnings ratios that were unsupportable. There was a common perception that the market was overpriced, and that a correction was certain to occur. At the same time tight monetary policy and a market expectation of continued tightening were driving up interest rates. Bad trade figures from August were announced in October. This created an anticipation that the Fed would raise interest rates again. With the stock market appearing overextended and interest rates rising, a switch from stocks to bonds began to appear increasingly attractive. Yet investors were also hesitant to make this move: &quot;...everybody knew the market was overpriced, but everybody was greedy and didn&#x27;t want to miss out on a continuation of the wonderful rise that had been going on since the beginning of the year. But they were very, very nervous&quot;. As a final catalyst, there was also concern that portfolio insurance would greatly accelerate any drop into an avalanche whenever it began. A return to equilibrium was thus inevitable, but when the bubble burst, the combination of portfolio selling, and significant market nervousness brought a sharp crash.

A second explanation for the crash lies in a crisis of confidence in the dollar created by uncertainties regarding the viability of the Louvre Accord. International investment in the US stock market had expanded significantly in the prolonged bull market. However, trade and budget deficits were bringing both downward pressure on the dollar and an expectation of higher interest rates. These factors and others motivated the industrialized nations (and in particular, the US, Japan and West Germany) to reach the Louvre agreement with several related goals in mind, one of which was to keep a floor beneath the value of the dollar while holding exchange rates within a specified band or reference range of one another. However, the market had limited confidence in the willingness of governments to abide by these agreements. The central banks of Japan and West Germany had been vocal about their fears of rising inflation; this created an expectation that these countries would raise interest rates to reduce liquidity and quell inflationary pressures. If those countries raised their rates, then in order to keep all countries within the agreed range of each other, the US would be expected to raise rates as well. When the Bundesbank followed through on its remarks and took steps to raise short-term interest rates, US Treasury Secretary James Baker publicly clashed with the Germans, making remarks that were interpreted as a threat to devalue the dollar. Even under normal circumstances, a weaker dollar would tend to make US stocks look less attractive to foreign investors. These remarks, however, created shock and panic among investors outside the US. They raised the prospect of a currency war, or even the collapse of the dollar, an anonymous senior Reagan administration later summarized the fear and uncertainty in investor&#x27;s minds after Baker&#x27;s statement: 

In this account, the result was a punishing selloff that started in Asia and spread to Europe and the US as markets opened up across the world.

===Market meltdown===

====De-linked markets and index arbitrage====
Under normal circumstances the stock market and those of its main derivatives–futures and options–are functionally a single market, given that the price of any particular stock is closely connected to the prices of its counterpart in both the futures and options market. Prices in the derivative markets are typically tightly connected to those of the underlying stock, though they differ somewhat (as for example, prices of futures are typically higher than that of their particular cash stock). During the crisis this link was broken.

When the futures market opened while the stock market was closed, it created a pricing imbalance: the listed price of those stocks which opened late had no chance to change from their closing price of the day before. The quoted prices were thus &quot;stale&quot; and did not reflect current economic conditions; they were generally listed higher than they should have been (and dramatically higher than their respective futures, which are typically higher than stocks).

The decoupling of these markets meant that futures prices had temporarily lost their validity as a vehicle for price discovery; they no longer could be relied upon to inform traders of the direction or degree of stock market expectations. This had harmful effects: it added to the atmosphere of uncertainty and confusion at a time when investor confidence was sorely needed; it discouraged investors from &quot;leaning against the wind&quot; and buying stocks since the discount in the futures market logically implied that investors could wait and purchase stocks at an even lower price; and it encouraged portfolio insurance investors to sell in the stock market, putting further downward pressure on stock prices.

The gap between the futures and stocks was quickly noted by index arbitrage traders who tried to profit through sell at market orders. Index arbitrage, a form of program trading, added to the confusion and the downward pressure on prices:

Although arbitrage between index futures and stocks placed downward pressure on prices, it does not explain why the surge in sell orders that brought steep price declines began in the first place. Moreover, the markets &quot;performed most chaotically&quot; during those times when the links that index arbitrage program trading creates between these markets was &quot;broken&quot;.

====Portfolio insurance hedges====
Portfolio insurance is a hedging technique which seeks to manage risk and limit losses by buying and selling financial instruments (for example, stocks or futures) in reaction to changes in market price rather than changes in market fundamentals. Specifically, they buy when the market is rising, and sell as the market falls, without regard for any fundamental information about &quot;why&quot; the market is rising or falling. Thus, it is an example of an &quot;informationless trade&quot; that has the potential to create a market-destabilizing feedback loop.

This strategy became a source of downward pressure when portfolio insurers whose computer models noted that stocks opened lower and continued their steep price decline. The models recommended even further sales. The potential for computer-generated feedback loops that these hedges created has been discussed as a factor compounding the severity of the crash, but not as an initial trigger. Economist Hayne Leland argues against this interpretation, suggesting that the impact of portfolio hedging on stock prices was probably relatively small. Similarly, the report of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange found the influence of &quot;other investors—mutual funds, broker-dealers, and individual shareholders—was thus three to five times greater than that of the portfolio insurers&quot; during the crash. Numerous econometric studies have analyzed the evidence to determine whether portfolio insurance exacerbated the crash, but the results have been unclear. Markets around the world that did not have portfolio insurance trading experienced as much turmoil and loss as the US market. More to the point, the cross-market analysis of Richard Roll, for example, found that markets with a greater prevalence of computerized trading (including portfolio insurance) actually experienced relatively less severe losses (in percentage terms) than those without.

====Noise trading====
Contemporaneous causality and feedback behavior between markets increased dramatically during this period. In a volatile and uncertain market, investors worldwide were inferring information from changes in stock prices and communication with other investors in a self-reinforcing contagion of fear. This pattern of basing trading decisions on market psychology is often referred to as one form of &quot;noise trading&quot;, which occurs when ill-informed investors &quot;[trade] on noise as if it were news&quot;. A significant amount of trading takes place based on information which is unquantifiable and potentially irrelevant, such as unsubstantiated rumors or a &quot;gut feeling&quot;. Investors vary between seemingly rational and irrational behaviors as they &quot;struggle to find their way between the give and take, between risk and return, one moment engaging in cool calculation and the next yielding to emotional impulses&quot;. If noise is misinterpreted as meaningful news, then the reactions of risk-averse traders and arbitrageurs will bias the market, preventing it from establishing prices that accurately reflect the fundamental state of the underlying stocks. For example, on October 19 rumors that the NYSE would close created additional confusion and drove prices further downward, while rumors the next day that two Chicago Mercantile Exchange clearinghouses were insolvent deterred some investors from trading in that marketplace.

A feedback loop of noise-induced-volatility has been cited by some analysts as the major reason for the severe depth of the crash. It does not, however, explain what initially triggered the market break. Moreover, Lawrence A. Cunningham has suggested that while noise theory is &quot;supported by substantial empirical evidence and a well-developed intellectual foundation&quot;, it makes only a partial contribution toward explaining events such as the crash of October 1987. Informed traders, not swayed by psychological or emotional factors, have room to make trades they know to be less risky.

==Aftermath==
After Black Monday, regulators overhauled trade-clearing protocols to bring uniformity to all prominent market products. They also developed new regulatory instruments, known as &quot;trading curbs&quot; or &quot;circuit breakers&quot;, allowing exchanges to temporarily halt in instances of exceptionally large price decline; for instance, the DJIA. The curbs were implemented multiple times during the 2020 stock market crash.

Arguably, a second consequence of the crash was the death of the Louvre Accord. Its intent was already being defeated by market forces as early as April of that year. Then the response of the Reagan administration to the crash was to deliberately let both interest rates and the value of the dollar fall to provide liquidity. They later resumed some interventions on behalf of the dollar until December 1988, but eventually it became clear that &quot;international currency coordination of any kind, including a target zone, is not possible.&quot;

The crash of 1987 altered implied volatility patterns that arise in pricing financial options. Equity options traded in American markets did not show a volatility smile before the crash but began showing one afterward.

<text>Leptospermum is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the myrtle family Myrtaceae commonly known as tea trees, although this name is sometimes also used for some species of &quot;Melaleuca&quot;. Most species are endemic to Australia, with the greatest diversity in the south of the continent, but some are native to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and Southeast Asia. Leptospermums all have five conspicuous petals and five groups of stamens which alternate with the petals. There is a single style in the centre of the flower and the fruit is a woody capsule.

The first formal description of a leptospermum was published in 1776 by the German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam Forster, but an unambiguous definition of individual species in the genus was not achieved until 1979. Leptospermums grow in a wide range of habitats but are most commonly found in moist, low-nutrient soils. They have important uses in horticulture, in the production of honey and in floristry.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Leptospermum&quot; range in size from prostrate shrubs to small trees, and have fibrous, flaky or papery bark. The leaves are arranged alternately and are relatively small, rigid and often aromatic when crushed. The flowers may be solitary or in groups, and have bracteoles and sepals which in most species fall off as the flower opens. There are five spreading, conspicuous petals which are white, pink or red. There are many stamens which are usually shorter than the petals and in five groups opposite the stamens, although they often appear not to be grouped. A simple style usually arises from a small depression in the ovary which has from three to five sections in most species, each section containing a few to many ovules. The fruit is a woody capsule which opens at the top to release the seeds, although in some species this does not occur until the plant, or the part of it, dies.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The first formal description of a leptospermum was published by Johann Reinhold Forster and Johann Georg Adam Forster in their 1776 book, &quot;Characteres Generum Plantarum&quot;. In 1876, George Bentham described twenty species, but noted the difficulty of discriminating between species. (&quot;The species are very difficult to discriminate.&quot;) Of the species he named, only ten remain as valid.

In 1979, Barbara Briggs and Laurie Johnson published a classification of the family Myrtaceae in the &quot;Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales&quot;. Although there have been revisions to their groupings, their paper allowed a systematic examination of species in the genus &quot;Leptospermum&quot;. In 1989, Joy Thompson published a complete revision of the genus. In 2000, O&#x27;Brien &quot;et al.&quot; published yet another revision, using matK-based evidence to suggest that &quot;Leptospermum&quot; is polyphyletic, and should be split into persistent, Western non-persistent, and Eastern non-persistent fruiting plants, with &quot;Leptospermum spinescens&quot; as an outlier. However, neither phylogeny has been universally accepted. Current estimates recognize about ninety species of &quot;Leptospermum&quot;.

The common name &quot;tea tree&quot; derives from the practice of early Australian settlers who soaked the leaves of several species in boiling water to make a herbal tea. The genus name (&quot;Leptospermum&quot;) means &quot;slender-seeded&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Most &quot;Leptospermum&quot; species are endemic to Australia where most are found in southern areas of the country. They are most common in moist, nutrient-poor soils although they sometimes occupy other situations. &quot;Leptospermum laevigatum&quot; is usually found growing on beach sand and &quot;L. riparium&quot; growing in Tasmanian rainforest on the edges of rivers. &quot;Leptospermum amboinense&quot; extends from Queensland to Southeast Asia and three species, &quot;L. javanicum&quot;, &quot;L. parviflorum&quot; and &quot;L. recurvum&quot; are endemic to southeast Asia. &quot;L. recurvum&quot; is only found on Mount Kinabalu in Sabah. &quot;Leptospermum scoparium&quot; is one of the most widespread in the genus and occurs in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and New Zealand, where it is one of the most widespread and important native shrub species.

==Ecology==
In Australia, &quot;Leptospermum&quot; species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus &quot;Aenetus&quot;, including &quot;A. lewinii&quot; and &quot;A. ligniveren&quot;. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down.

==Uses==
===Use in horticulture===
Most &quot;Leptospermum&quot; species make desirable garden plants. The hardiest species (&quot;L. lanigerum, L. liversidgei, L. polygalifolium, L. rupestre, L. scoparium&quot;) are hardy to about to ; others are sensitive to frost. They tolerate most soils, but many suppliers specify ericaceous (i.e. lime-free) compost with good drainage and full sun. Established plants are drought tolerant. They are often found as hedge plants on the west coast of the United States, and some species are popular for cultivation as bonsai. Many cultivars exist.

===Use in floristry===
These flowers are also grown in double cultivars and are used in floral designs. However, they do not last when out of water and the single flowers do not last when wired. The &#x27;Pacific Beauty&#x27; (&quot;Leptospermum polygalifolium&quot;) is a useful flower to use in large church-service bowls and function arrangements, however use of &quot;Leptospermum&quot; in corporate designs is less desirable as they dry and drop when subjected to heating and air conditioning.

===Honey production===
The nectar from the flowers is harvested by bees, yielding Leptospermum honey, which is marketed as Manuka honey. Honey produced from Australian &quot;Leptospermum polygalifolium&quot; is also known as &quot;jelly bush&quot; or the &quot;lemon-scented tea tree&quot;.

<text>Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California is a private Catholic college in Moraga, California. Established in 1863, it is administered by the De La Salle Brothers. The college offers undergraduate and graduate programs with a total student count at under 4,000 .

== History ==

St. Mary&#x27;s College began in 1863 as a diocesan college for boys established by Joseph Alemany, a member of the Dominicans and the first archbishop of San Francisco. One of its first donors was Mary Ellen Pleasant, a famed Black Catholic philanthropist who gave the school roughly $10,000 in today&#x27;s money to help get the school off the ground.

Unhappy with the archdiocese&#x27;s operation of the college, Archbishop Alemany applied for assistance from Rome and in 1868 St. Mary&#x27;s College was handed over to the De La Salle Christian Brothers.

In 1889, the college moved east across San Francisco Bay to Oakland, California. The location on the corner of 30th and Broadway became affectionately known as &quot;The Brickpile&quot; and Saint Mary&#x27;s College would call Oakland home until 1928, when it moved further eastward to Moraga after a fire severely damaged the Brickpile. The Oakland site is California Historical Landmark #676 and has been marked by a commemorative plaque. The former San Francisco site is now the site of the St. Mary&#x27;s Park neighborhood. The college and high school sections separated not long after the move to Moraga and the high school is currently located in Albany.
During its first years in Moraga, the college nearly went bankrupt, but eventually managed to gain financial security when it was bought by Archbishop John Joseph Mitty, for whom a residence hall is now named. During World War II the college was used by the United States Navy for the training of pilots. Former President Gerald Ford was briefly stationed at the school and served as a naval instructor. The navy erected many buildings, including the world&#x27;s largest indoor pool, but only one, Assumption Hall, remains on the campus as the school had little use for most of the buildings after the war. Saint Mary&#x27;s continued to be a male-only school until 1970, when it became coeducational. Since then, more women have come to the college and by 2011, 62% of the students were women.

In the 1970s, the college was well known by secondary schools throughout the San Francisco Bay Area for producing the Saint Mary&#x27;s Math Contest. The popular contest was discontinued in 1978 but later became the chief inspiration for the Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival which continues to this day.

Roughly two dozen Christian Brothers still live and work at the school, and the school presidents had always been Brothers until 2013. Recognizing the dwindling number of Christian Brothers, in 2003 the college&#x27;s bylaws were changed to allow the election of a non-Christian Brother to the presidency if no qualified Brother exists or steps forward. James A. Donahue, a committed and engaged Roman Catholic, became the first non-Christian Brother to serve as president in the 150-year history of Saint Mary&#x27;s on July 1, 2013.

==Academics==


There are four schools at Saint Mary&#x27;s: the School of Liberal Arts, the School of Science, the School of Economics and Business Administration, and the Kalmanovitz School of Education. Saint Mary&#x27;s College is a liberal arts institution, and the majority of undergraduate students are in the School of Liberal Arts. However, the most popular major is Business Administration. This is followed by Psychology, Communication, Kinesiology, and Accounting. The average class size is 19, with a student faculty ratio of 13:1. 91% of classes are taught by full-time faculty, of which 95% hold the highest degree in their fields. There are 40 academic majors, with an option to create your own major. Most Saint Mary&#x27;s faculty are required to teach six courses per year (three per semester).

===Collegiate seminar===
In addition to these general education courses, traditional four-year students take three Collegiate Seminar courses. Although previously based on the academic programs at St. John&#x27;s College, the Saint Mary&#x27;s College program is required for all students regardless of major. The first course is offered in the spring of their first year, in the fall of their sophomore year, and then students have the choice of when they want to take the last course during their junior or senior years. Transfer students take a course that combines the first and second-year courses before completing the final course. One section of a Seminar elective course, Multicultural Thought, is offered in both the fall and spring semesters.

===Integral Program===

The Integral Liberal Arts Program is a &quot;college-within-a-college&quot;. It is distinct from a major at Saint Mary&#x27;s College, and it incorporates the Seminar method for all of its classes. It was modeled on St. John&#x27;s College. The Integral Program is a complete four-year Great Books course of study, covering all mathematics, science, religious and language requirements. Instead of taking four classes in addition to the general education, Integral students&#x27; entire curriculum, including subjects not traditionally related to the &quot;classics,&quot; is in the Seminar style. For example, math is taught through reading and discussing Euclid and Galileo, rather than actually completing numerical problem sets. Although the Seminar portion of the program is twice as long (eight semesters vs. four), moves more quickly and covers more material than the Collegiate Seminar program, it is not an honors program. The program does not have any tests or lectures, however students are expected to complete a substantial amount of reading per night in preparation for classroom discussions. Although seminal works such as the Bible and the writings of some theologians are organic to the Western Canon, the program itself is non-religious. Classics from cultures other than western are in the Program roughly where they were chronologically introduced into western discourse.

While the Integral Program is housed in the School of Liberal Arts and Integral students receive a Bachelor of Arts degree, Integral Liberal Arts students graduate separately from the Liberal Arts majors. Many students go on to graduate school for pre-med or pre-law studies.

===Term schedule===
Saint Mary&#x27;s has a &quot;4–1–4&quot; system, similar to Middlebury College: fall semester, January Term, and spring semester. Students are given three weeks off for Christmas following fall semester, one week off following Jan-Term, and one week in the middle of spring semester for Easter. Fall semester usually begins the Monday before Labor Day and runs through the second week of December. Graduation is usually the third or fourth week of May.

January Term is an academic session in which during the month of January students are required to take one class and encouraged to take one outside their major. Jan Term classes are more intensive than a normal fall or spring class. Instead of meeting two or three times a week, they meet four times a week for two and a half hours. Students must take four Jan Term classes to graduate. This differs from many colleges at which January Term or &quot;Intersession&quot; is optional. Each year, a committee meets to determine the year&#x27;s January Term theme, and the process includes a vote of the final three selections by the community. Classes during January Term range from Shakespeare to Star Trek, and students have the option to travel abroad for their January class. There are also optional quarter credit classes for January Term and during the semesters, such as digital photography or weight training.

==Campus==

St. Mary&#x27;s historic campus is located in Moraga, California. The majority of the principal buildings on campus are built in the California Churrigueresque style, while the rest of campus is made up of other styles of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture or Mission Revival architecture.

All first-year students at Saint Mary&#x27;s live on campus. 55% of the total student population lives on campus. There are six first year residence halls (Augustine, Justin, Mitty, De La Salle, Aquinas and Assumption Halls). All first year residence halls (with the exception of Aquinas) are set up &quot;community style,&quot; in which two or three students usually share a room and the entire floor shares a central bathroom. Floors are usually separated by sex in first year halls (because of the shared bathrooms). The only exceptions are Aquinas hall which has students live in suites with their own bathroom, and the first floor of Assumption, which is coeducational with separate bathrooms for each sex. Currently, first years living on campus are guaranteed a spot on campus for their second year. Sophomores live in Becket Hall, More Hall, North and South Claeys Halls, and Ageno A, B, and C Halls. All of these halls are &quot;suite&quot; style living and each suite comes with three or four bedrooms, accommodates six students, and has its own bathroom and shower. Floors on suite buildings are co-ed.
Juniors and seniors enter into a housing lottery to determine if they can live on campus. Many upperclassmen live in &quot;townhouse&quot; buildings: Ageno East and West, Guerreri East and West, Freitas, Thille, Syufy and Sabatte Halls. All townhouses come with two or three bedrooms (accommodating five to six students), a bathroom and shower, kitchen and living room. Upperclassmen also live off-campus in Moraga, Orinda, Lafayette, and Walnut Creek. Upperclassmen resident advisers, as well as a few other upperclassmen, live in the traditionally freshman and sophomore halls. All residence hall rooms are fully furnished and come with two phones with free long distance, free Internet, and free TV cable outlet. Others often choose to live at home if they are within half an hour of campus. In addition to several student resident advisers, each residence hall also has at least one resident director, who is a Brother or a faculty or staff member and lives in the residence hall.
There are four Living Learning Communities on campus. The Honors/Science living learning community is available only for first years and is located in Assumption Hall. Live-in tutors specializing in the sciences and the humanities – along with live-in faculty – help to create this intellectually stimulating and supportive community. The International Community is located in Claeys Hall North, where both international and domestic students can learn skills important in both cross-cultural communication and living globally. The Lasallian Community is a community of sophomores living in Becket Hall. They participate in a class, service and community time together and are focused on learning the life and principles of Saint John Baptist De La Salle. The Santiago Community is a community of juniors and Seniors living in Ageno West who are focused on a Faith, Service, and Community aspect, and learning about James Santiago Miller who died when his work to educate the poor came in opposition to the military powers.

The majority of classes are held in Galileo, Dante and Garaventa halls, which each have three floors. Most of the professors&#x27; offices are also in these halls. A science building, known as Brousseau Hall was built in 2000. Sichel Hall is a smaller, media-oriented classroom building used by the Communication Department, and Syufy Performing Arts Hall houses large and small practice rooms for arts students. The newest building on campus is Filippi Academic Hall, which houses the School of Education. The library, St. Albert Hall, is located near the freshmen dorms.

The cafeteria is called Oliver Hall and its neighbor, Dryden Hall has recently been retrofitted into overflow seating for Oliver Hall and is also used for other events around campus. The Cassin Student Union is a student lounge, adjacent to Dryden. Attached to Cassin is Café Louis, a coffee shop, which is operated by Sodexo, the same company that runs the dining hall. Other spaces often used by students are the Delphine Intercultural Center, the Women&#x27;s Resource Center and the bookstore.

Athletics facilities include McKeon Pavilion (basketball and volleyball), Saint Mary&#x27;s Stadium (soccer and rugby), Madigan Gym, Louis Guisto Field (baseball), Cottrell Field (softball) as well as additional soccer, rugby and intramural fields. The college also operates Timothy Korth Tennis Complex and frequently hosts conference, area and regional tennis tournaments. In March 2015, the college opened the new Joseph L. Alioto Recreation Center.

Two other important buildings are the Soda Activity Center and the Lefevre Theatre, where various events are held. There is also St. Albert Hall Library and the Brother Cornelius Art Center, which houses both classrooms and the Saint Mary&#x27;s College Museum of Art. All buildings on campus except Assumption Hall are named after an important person in the Catholic religion or a person important to the school.

There is a cross at the top of a hill on campus and a large concrete &quot;SMC&quot; on top of one of the surrounding hills, which gets painted frequently by student groups around campus.

==Museum of Art==
Saint Mary’s College of California began collecting art in the early 20th century. Founded by professor Brother Fidelis Cornelius Braeg in 1934, the William Keith Gallery exhibited the museum&#x27;s collection of paintings by the renowned California landscape artist, who lived from 1838 to 1911. Brother Cornelius wrote &quot;Old Master of California&quot;, a biography of Keith, after years or working directly with the artist&#x27;s widow, Mary McHenry Keith.

The gallery was expanded in 1977 with a grant from the Hearst Art Foundation and reopened as the Hearst Art Gallery. Through this expansion, the gallery began exhibiting ethnographic materials and works by Western artists.

In 2011, the Hearst Art Gallery completed an extensive renovation and expansion project, and was renamed Saint Maryʼs College Museum of Art (SMCMoA). In 2021, the museum was awarded accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums, the highest national recognition afforded to museums in the United States; of over 1000 museums in California, SMCMoA is one of only 77 accredited.

SMCMoA cares for a permanent collection of over 5000 objects including the William Keith Collection, the most comprehensive collection of the artist&#x27;s work, with over 200 objects. The museum rotates exhibitions twice a year, showcasing the permanent collection, traveling exhibitions, and emerging California artists.

The museum is located in the Brother Cornelius Art Center. All exhibitions and public programs are free and open to the public, and the facility is ADA accessible.

==Student life==

As a Lasallian school, community service plays a big role on campus. The Catholic Institute for Lasallian Social Action coordinates most service work on campus, and each year students perform many hours of community service. On the first Saturday of every other month, they have the opportunity to participate in &quot;Saturday of Service&quot; where Saint Mary&#x27;s students branch out all across the Bay Area and serve their community.

==Athletics==

Saint Mary&#x27;s has 17 Division I teams, competing in the West Coast Conference. The nickname of Saint Mary&#x27;s sports teams is the Gaels, which had been given to the school&#x27;s football team in 1926 by Pat Frayne, a writer for the San Francisco Call-Bulletin. The school&#x27;s previous nickname was the Saints although the baseball team still kept the nickname the Phoenix up until the 1940s.

The men&#x27;s basketball team is recognized nationally as one of the top mid-major programs in the country; in 2010, it made it to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen.

The Gaels are also known for their strong pursuit of Australian talent, such as NBA players Patty Mills and Matthew Dellavedova. Chants such as &quot;Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi&quot; are common among students, and an Australian flag now hangs from the back wall of Saint Mary&#x27;s basketball arena, McKeon Pavilion during games. This has also given the college a big following in Australia, with most basketball games shown on ESPN Australia/New Zealand. Point guard Matthew Dellavedova was named WCC Player of the Year in 2012 and became the first male athlete at Saint Mary&#x27;s to earn first-team Capital One Academic All-America honors. In 2013, he broke school records becoming the all-time leader in scoring, assists, and three-pointers.

In 2011, the men&#x27;s soccer team won the West Coast Conference title, beating the University of San Diego, 1–0, giving Saint Mary&#x27;s an automatic bid into the NCAA Tournament and their first-ever WCC title. In the first round Saint Mary&#x27;s defeated No. 25 CSU Bakersfield 1–0 to send them to the next round. The second round was played against UC Irvine. The Gaels defeated the No. 7 Anteaters, 2–1, in double overtime. The game-winning goal was headed in by Justin Howard in the 103rd minute, sending Saint Mary&#x27;s into the &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;. The third round of the NCAA Tournament saw the Gaels against Brown University, beating the Bears in overtime 3–2, at Stevenson Field. The win over the Bears sent the Gaels into the &quot;Elite Eight,&quot; making it only the second team in school history to make it to the Elite Eight along with the 1959 men&#x27;s basketball team. Saint Mary&#x27;s lost to the University of North Carolina in the Quarter Finals, 2–0. The participation of the men&#x27;s soccer team in the 2011 NCAA Tournament was the most successful postseason run in Saint Mary&#x27;s history.
In 2012, the Gaels&#x27; golf team took the program&#x27;s first-ever WCC title, and junior Ben Geyer became just the fourth Saint Mary&#x27;s player to take home medalist honors in the tournament&#x27;s 41-year history. Head coach Scott Hardy earned his seventh WCC Coach of the Year honor after leading the team to the 2013 title – the first back-to-back championship in program history. He earned his eight WCC Coach of the Year honors in 2015.

In 2001, the women&#x27;s basketball and soccer teams competed in their NCAA tournaments, with both teams advancing to the second round. The women&#x27;s volleyball team advanced to the &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; in 2004. Women&#x27;s tennis, softball and volleyball won the WCC Conference championships and went on to play in NCAA postseason tournaments. The 2010 and 2013 women&#x27;s tennis teams won WCC championships and the program has advanced to 4-straight NCAA tournaments, the most consecutive invitations to NCAA tournament play of any Saint Mary&#x27;s athletic program.

Saint Mary&#x27;s College was once known for its American football team led by Edward &quot;Slip&quot; Madigan, which dominated west coast football, indeed beating USC and California during the thirties, and with several wins against eastern powerhouses during the 20s, 30s, and 40s including winning the 1939 Cotton Bowl by narrowly defeating favored Texas Tech 20 to 13. The Gaels were known for their flashy style that reflected the personality of their flamboyant coach. Madigan traveled to New York for the Fordham game with 150 fans on a train that was labelled &quot;the world&#x27;s longest bar.&quot; To stir up publicity for the game, he threw a party the night before and invited not only sportswriters, but such celebrities as Babe Ruth and New York mayor Jimmy Walker. They dropped the sport in 2004.

Currently, 60% of the students who attend Saint Mary&#x27;s are involved with organized athletics. There are 13 club sports teams that they have the opportunity to participate in as well as Intramural teams and NCAA. Student-athletes from Saint Mary&#x27;s graduate at the second-highest success rate among all California Division 1 Institutions, according to data released by NCAA.

Another successful sports program at Saint Mary&#x27;s is rugby, which, though not well known in the United States generally, is the oldest athletic club at Saint Mary&#x27;s. The men&#x27;s rugby team enjoyed a rise in the past few years and won the school&#x27;s first national championship on May 10, 2014, beating Life University 21–6 to win the USA Rugby D1A title at Stanford University. The team frequently is ranked among the top teams in the country, competing with large high-profile schools such as California, Ohio State, and the military academies. In 2008, it reached the Final Four of the USA Rugby Division One National Championship tournament, losing to California 41–31 in the semi-finals, and was also ranked at #2 in the nation for Division 1 Collegiate Rugby at the season&#x27;s end. In 2011, it competed in the National 7s and in 2012, after beating No.1 ranked California 20 –18 in Moraga, the team finished the regular season undefeated in the Pacific Coast Conference and ranked No. 2 in the country. It defeated Utah 25–15 in the D1-A quarterfinals before falling to Arkansas State in the semifinals. In 2015, the Saint Mary&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Rugby team clinched the national D1-A title for the second year in a row when it beat Life University 30-24 at Kennesaw State University in Georgia.

<text>Great Crosby is an area of the town of Crosby, in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England and is historically, part of Lancashire.

==Location==
In 1907, the Victoria County History described Great Crosby&#x27;s location thus: &#x27;The ancient township of Great Crosby, which includes Waterloo, lies on the northern shore of the estuary of the Mersey, with a level sandy beach extending over three miles (5 km) from north-west to southeast; it stretches inland some two miles (3 km), and has an area of , of which belong to the present diminished township. The village, which lies more than a mile inland, is becoming modernized and growing quickly, especially along the principal road, that from Liverpool to Southport, which crosses the township in a northerly direction, with roads branching off to the shore and to Thornton. The Liverpool and Southport line of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, opened in 1848, with stations at Waterloo and Blundellsands, also passes through the township. An electric tramway connects Great Crosby with the Seaforth terminus of the Liverpool Overhead Railway.&#x27; 

==History==
Great Crosby was a small village of Viking origin until the arrival of the railway in the 1840s. The village grew rapidly during the late 19th and early 20th century and merged with a number of distinct areas with their own character, to form the Great Crosby urban district. These areas included:
* &quot;Crosby Village&quot;, the main area for shopping, pubs and restaurants
* Blundellsands, a middle class residential area close to the seafront
* Brighton-le-Sands
* Thornton, a residential area of semi-detached and detached housing which dates mainly from the 1930s.

Great Crosby was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Sephton, in 1866 Great Crosby became a separate civil parish, in 1894 Great Crosby became an urban district, the urban district annexed Little Crosby in 1932. On 9 November 1937, the district was combined with the Waterloo with Seaforth urban district to form the municipal borough of Crosby, On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and it became part of the new Metropolitan Borough of Sefton. In 1951 the parish had a population of 26,982. These boundary changes defined the town of Crosby in its modern borders and shrank down the modern area of Great Crosby from the old urban district, making it an area of the modern town of Crosby which today is a separate area of Crosby to Blundellsands, Brighton-le-Sands, and Thornton.

==Amenities==
Great Crosby has three fee-paying schools (Merchant Taylors&#x27; Boys&#x27; School, Merchant Taylors&#x27; Girls&#x27; School, St Mary&#x27;s College), a number of state schools (including Sacred Heart Catholic College) and parks facing the sea. In nearby Waterloo there is a cinema, the Plaza Community Cinema, which is run by volunteers.

In the past, Crosby had five cinemas: the Corona, and the Regent were in the northern part of the district. The Corona, almost opposite the Library, in College Road, was part of the Gaumont chain, and after merging with the Rank Organisation became a second-run house, as Rank already had taken over the Plaza in Waterloo, which became an Odeon and had the first run policy. The Corona played the Bill Hayley film &#x27;Rock Around The Clock&#x27; just before the cinema closed in 1957 and demolished before the end of that decade. 
Waterloo had two independent cinemas, the Queens on South Road and the Winter Gardens in Church Road. The Queens closed in the late fifties, and the Winter Gardens closed nearly ten years later.

Another cinema in the Great Crosby area, was the Regent on Liverpool Road at the junction of Endbutt Lane; it became part of the ABC group, and closed in 1967 to become a bingo hall, and has since become part of St. Mary&#x27;s College. Land had been purchased in Crosby Village, across the road from the Crown Buildings, to be redeveloped into a Super Cinema. This never happened due to the onset of World War II. By the time building restrictions were lifted in the mid-1950s, cinema admissions were in decline. The land remained derelict until the 1960s when the Midland Bank and Satterthwaite&#x27;s shop, amongst others, were built on the site.

Above the College Road shops, from the Corona Cinema to the corner with Brompton Avenue, was the Corona Ballroom, mostly used for ballroom dancing. The entrance to the ballroom was in Brompton Avenue. Another musical venue was St. Lukes Church Hall on Liverpool Road, where regular Saturday night dances were held.

Alexandra Hall, completed in 1888 and situated at the junction of Mersey Road, College Road and Coronation Road was originally the Town Hall for the Crosby Urban District Council. When the Great Crosby and Waterloo with Seaforth Urban Districts were merged into the Borough of Crosby, the council offices were transferred to Waterloo Town Hall. The frontage of the red brick Alexandra Hall had an ironwork and glass canopy, which was removed in the late 1950s because of rust erosion. Alexandra Hall played host to The Beatles, before they became superstars, in January 1961. The Crosby Flower Show and local drama groups used the Main Hall upstairs each year. In the 1970s the building was converted into Law Courts, and survived to the Millennium. In 2004 the building was demolished and replaced by residential apartments.

A private park, known locally as the &#x27;Key Park&#x27;, consists of of unspoilt land in Warren Road, Blundellsands. Members pay a subscription, and are given a key.

Set in the Moor Park area, close to the heart of the old village, is the Northern Club, a multi-sporting club.

In College Road is the ground and club house for Marine Football Club. Also worthy of note is Waterloo R.F.C., with their ground in St. Anthony&#x27;s Road.

==Transport==
Residents can commute to Liverpool or Southport either by car, by bus or by train from Blundellsands &amp; Crosby and Hall Road stations, located on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network.

The Liverpool Overhead Railway opened in 1893, and to attract more custom, built a street tramway from their terminus at Seaforth Sands railway station, along Crosby Road South, Crosby Road North and Liverpool Road to terminate at the junction of Cooks Road and Victoria Road in the centre of Great Crosby. The tramway started in 1900 and had a 25 years lease; when this was due to expire Liverpool Corporation had shown interest in operating a service into Crosby; talks broke down at a late stage, and the Waterloo and Crosby Motor Services took on the route for bus operation, later taken over by Ribble Motor Services to become the L9.

Before 1932, Ribble Motor Services acquired the small local bus operators, including Waterloo and Crosby Motor Services (Ribble Timetables Area 4 1932). In 1936 Ribble opened a bus station on Little Crosby Road; this was very basic being a plot of land with a turning circle - passengers waited for their bus in a central waiting area which was open to the elements. Buses operated anti-clockwise round the waiting area.
Ribble monopolised the services in the district and their L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9, L11, L15, L20, L30, L50, L60, L80, L90, S1, S2 and S3 services served the district. The L3 was Ribble&#x27;s most frequent service linking Great Crosby with Liverpool Skelhorne Street; the service was also used for trials of new vehicles, and demonstrators. Once a year the S23 operated from Crosby Bus Station to Aintree Old Roan in connection with the Grand National; this service fell into decline and ceased in the early sixties. As traffic congestion grew in the early 1960s, the Ribble services began to suffer reliability problems. Ribble introduced two local services C1 and C2 using single deck vehicles in 1968. In January 1972, Ribble signed an agency agreement with Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive which gave the PTE control of all bus services in Crosby. In November 1974, PTE route 92 was introduced between Hall Road Station and Huyton. The Executive opened the Waterloo Interchange in January 1977, all local bus services were timed to connect with Merseyrail services to and from Liverpool.

The Liverpool to Southport railway line provided a link to Liverpool Exchange railway station, serving the business sector of the city. The line was listed in Dr. Beeching&#x27;s Report for closure in 1962, as requiring extra sets of trains for peak hour use only was costly. Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive recognised the needs of the line, and supported improvements to the service and stations, including diverting the line under the city centre (and so closing Liverpool Exchange, replaced by Moorfields railway station) and onward to Hunts Cross, and the line has survived.

The Southport to Liverpool line also had a through service to London Euston on weekdays, when a steam hauled train, generally of two or three carriages, would call at selected stations on the line including Blundellsands &amp; Crosby and Waterloo. The train would leave the line after Bootle Oriel Road, to take the line round the city to join the main line into Lime Street. The through coaches were discontinued in 1966 when the Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston line converted to electric powered locomotives from steam power.
To compensate for this loss of amenity, British Rail introduced a diesel multiple unit service between Southport Chapel Street and Liverpool Lime Street. Generally five trains a day ran on weekdays. This service operated until Liverpool Exchange Station closed in 1977, when the trains from Southport were diverted, proceeding under the city to Liverpool Central Low Level.

==Disasters==
In 1926 the erosion of the sand dunes near The Serpentine, brought the sides of several large houses down. The River Alt at Formby and Hightown were a major cause to the erosion of the banks of the River Mersey at Crosby. The sea moving ever closer, brought about the total demolition of the residences. Over the years since the erosion, the site has become a promenade for walkers, with a car park with a view.

<text>Akranes () is a port town and municipality on the west coast of Iceland, around north of the capital Reykjavík.

The area where Akranes is located was settled in the 9th century; however, it did not receive a municipal charter until 1942.

==History==
Akranes was settled in the 9th century by the brothers Þormóður and Ketill, sons of Bresi, who came from Ireland. The town started to form in the mid-17th century as a fishing village. In 1942, it was formally chartered, and in the following years it had the biggest surge in population in its history.

Industry has been a big and growing employer: a cement plant has been operated in the town since the 1950s, and an aluminium smelting plant has been in operation near the town since 1998.

==Economy==
The fishing industry remains the town&#x27;s most important source of employment. Akranes also acts as a service center for the large rural region surrounding it.

The town is expected to grow in the coming years because of an increase in industrial activity and improvements in transportation to the Reykjavík area. The Hvalfjörður Tunnel, opened in 1998, is one of the world&#x27;s longest underwater road tunnels.

==Notable people==
Akranes was the birthplace of the Atom poet Jón Óskar, the writer Eva Björg Ægisdóttir and footballers Ríkharður Jónsson and Arnór Sigurðsson.

==Sport==
Akranes has a strong football tradition. The local team, Íþróttabandalag Akraness (ÍA), which currently plays in the Úrvalsdeild karla, has for many years been among the best of the Icelandic football league system. Ríkharður Jónsson, who was born in the town, is often considered to be one of Iceland&#x27;s finest footballers. He both played for and managed ÍA. Former Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal midfielder Siggi Jónsson was also born in Akranes and had three seasons as a player with ÍA. The town is also home to second division club Knattspyrnufélagið Kári.

==Climate==
Akranes has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Eolo&quot;), with temperatures rising above only in July and August.
==Twin towns – sister cities==
Akranes is twinned with:

* Bamble, Norway
* Närpes, Finland
* Qaqortoq, Greenland
* Sørvágur, Faroe Islands
* Tønder, Denmark
* Västervik, Sweden

<text>Hatfield is a town in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 3,352 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. The census-designated place of Hatfield consists of the town center and surrounding areas.

==History==

Hatfield was founded in 1660 on land granted to General Daniel Dennison and Governor William Bradford. It was formally incorporated as a town in 1670 and has a board of selectmen and an annual town meeting.

One of the theories of Hatfield&#x27;s incorporation in 1670 was that during that time it was a colony of Hadley and Hadley&#x27;s church was located across the Connecticut River on what is now West Street in present-day Hadley. The citizens living in what is now Hatfield asked the officials if they could build the church on the west side of the river, so that they could go to church and not have to cross the river, which was hard to cross every week, especially during the winter season when the river would freeze. When the citizens asked main Hadley, Hadley said &quot;No.&quot; Enraged, they held a vote on whether Hatfield would still remain territory of Hadley, or secede into its own town. The vote for secession won. Many believed this was a good decision as during that time, travel was not easy, and it was very unusual for the already large Hadley, which had already claimed many of its surrounding towns, to have a spot on the west side of the river.

As a center for agriculture, the region produced cattle, sheep, corn, and tobacco. At first their relations with the local Native Americans were very welcoming on both sides. On October 16, 1675, a substantial part of the town was destroyed in King Philip&#x27;s War, and surviving settlers sought refuge in Springfield. On September 19, 1677, another raid occurred, killing thirteen and resulting in seventeen hostages being taken to Canada. After nine months, the surviving hostages were ransomed and returned to Hatfield.

During the American Revolution, Hatfield was an important source of supplies and men for the rebels. In 1786, the town was used as an assembly area for the discontented who became involved in Shays&#x27; Rebellion.

One family supplied many of Hatfield&#x27;s physicians for generations. The Hastings family, descendants of English Puritan immigrant Thomas Hastings, was originally settled at Watertown, but within a generation members of the family had relocated to Hatfield, where they produced a succession of Hatfield physicians, including Dr. Thomas Hastings (1652–1712); Dr. Thomas Hastings (1679–1728); Dr. Waitstill Hastings (1714–1748); and Dr. John Hastings (1765–1845). The first Thomas Hastings, aside from serving as physician to Hatfield and surrounding communities, was also the town&#x27;s first schoolteacher. He authored a contemporary account of the devastating 1704 Indian attack on nearby Deerfield.

Hatfield was the birthplace and hometown of Sophia Smith (1796–1870), the founder of both Smith Academy (the Hatfield public high school), and Smith College, the famous women&#x27;s college in Northampton. Another notable resident was Rebecca Dickinson (1738–1812), a never-married gownmaker whose surviving diary, preserved in the collections of the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association in Deerfield, has served as the basis for scholarship in early American women&#x27;s history.

==Geography==
Hatfield is located on the west bank of the Connecticut River at the mouth of the Mill River, north of Springfield and about west of Boston. It is bordered to the west by Horse Mountain (a typical New England granite glacial remnant) and the town of Williamsburg, to the north by the town of Whately, to the east and south across the Connecticut River by the town of Hadley, and to the southwest by the city of Northampton.

<text>The following is a list of the lieutenant governors of Saskatchewan. Though the present day office of the Lieutenant Governor in Saskatchewan came into being only upon the province&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation in 1905, the post is a continuation from the first Governorship of the Northwest Territories in 1869.

<text>Arthur Hunt Lyman (February 2, 1932 – February 24, 2002) was a Hawaiian jazz vibraphone and marimba player. His group popularized a style of faux-Polynesian music during the 1950s and 1960s which later became known as exotica. His albums became favorite stereo-effect demonstration discs during the early days of the stereophonic LP album for their elaborate and colorful percussion, deep bass and 3-dimensional recording soundstage. Lyman was known as &quot;the King of Lounge music.&quot;

==Biography==
Arthur Lyman was born on the island of Kauai in the U.S. territory of Hawaii, on February 2, 1932. He was the youngest of eight children of a Hawaiian mother and a father of Hawaiian, French, Belgian and Chinese descent. When Arthur&#x27;s father, a riveter, lost his eyesight in an accident on Kauai, the family settled in Makiki, a subdistrict of Honolulu. Arthur&#x27;s father was very strict with him, each day after school locking him in a room with orders to play along to a stack of Benny Goodman records &quot;to learn what good music is.&quot; &quot;I had a little toy marimba,&quot; Lyman later recalled, &quot;a sort of bass xylophone, and from those old 78 rpm disks I learned every note Lionel Hampton recorded with the Goodman group.&quot; At age eight he made his public debut playing his toy marimba on the &quot;Listerine Amateur Hour&quot; on radio station KGMB, Honolulu, playing &quot;Twelfth Street Rag.&quot; &quot;I won a bottle of Listerine,&quot; he laughed. Lyman joined his father and brother playing USO shows on the bases at Kaneohe and Pearl Harbor. Over the next few years he became adept at the four-mallet style of playing which offers a greater range of chord-forming options. In fact he became good enough to turn professional at age 14 when he joined a group called the Gadabouts, playing vibes in the cool-jazz style then in vogue. &quot;I was working at Leroy&#x27;s, a little nightclub down by Kakaako. I was making about $60 a week, working Monday to Saturday, from 9 to 2 in the morning, and then I&#x27;d go to school. So it was kind of tough.&quot;

==Exotica==
After graduating from McKinley High School in 1951, he put music on hold to work as a desk clerk at the Halekulani hotel. It was there in 1954 that he met pianist Martin Denny, who, after hearing him play, offered the 21-year-old a spot in his band. Initially wary, Lyman was persuaded by the numbers: he was making $280 a month as a clerk, and Denny promised more than $100 a week. Denny had been brought to Hawaii in January on contract by Don the Beachcomber, and stayed in Hawaii to play nightly in the Shell Bar at the Hawaiian Village. Other members of his band were Augie Colon on percussion and John Kramer on string bass. Denny, who had traveled widely, had collected numerous exotic instruments from all over the world and liked to use them to spice up his jazz arrangements of popular songs. The stage of the Shell Bar was very exotic, with a little tropical garden pool of water right outside the bandstand, and rocks &amp; palm trees growing around. One full moon night Lyman had &quot;had a little too many Mai-Tais to drink,&quot; and when they began playing the theme from &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;, Lyman let out a few bird calls. &quot;The next thing you know, the audience started to answer me back with all kinds of weird cries. It was great.&quot; These bird calls became a trademark of Lyman&#x27;s sound.
When Denny&#x27;s &quot;Exotica&quot; album was released on record in 1957 it became a smash hit, igniting a national mania for all things South Pacific during the lead-up to Hawai&#x27;i becoming a state, including the stage play, the movie, tiki-themed restaurants like Don the Beachcomber&#x27;s and Trader Vic&#x27;s, luaus, Oceanic art, exotic drinks, aloha shirts, and straw hats.

==Later career==
That same year, Lyman was persuaded by Henry J. Kaiser to leave The Martin Denny Group to form his own group, continuing in much the same style but even more flamboyant. For decades Arthur and Martin did not speak to each other, but eventually came together (with many of their former bandmates) on Denny&#x27;s 1990 CD &quot;Exotica &#x27;90&quot; and remained friends since. Although the Polynesian craze faded as music trends changed, Lyman&#x27;s combo continued to play to tourists nearly every Friday and Saturday night at the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel in Honolulu throughout the 1970s. Lyman continued to play as a solo act at the New Otani in the 1980s and 1990s. He also performed for years at Don the Beachcomber&#x27;s Polynesian Village, the Shell Bar, the Waialae Country Club and the Canoe House at the Ilikai Hotel at Waikiki, the Bali Hai in San Diego and at the Edgewater Beach Hotel in Chicago. During the peak of his popularity Lyman recorded more than 30 albums and almost 400 singles, earning three gold albums. &quot;Taboo&quot; peaked at number 6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s album chart and stayed on the chart for over a year, eventually selling more than two million copies. The title song peaked at number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in July 1959. Lyman&#x27;s biggest pop single was &quot;Yellow Bird,&quot; originally a Haitian song, which peaked at #4 in July 1961. His last charting single was &quot;Love For Sale&quot; (reaching number 43 in March 1963), but his music enjoyed a new burst of popularity in the 1990s with the lounge music revival and CD reissues.

==Death==
Lyman died from esophageal cancer in February 2002.

==Recording details==
Most of Lyman&#x27;s albums were recorded in the aluminum Kaiser geodesic dome auditorium on the grounds of the Kaiser Hawaiian Village Hotel on Waikiki in Honolulu. This space provided unique acoustics and a natural 3-second reverberation. His recordings also benefited from being recorded on a one-of-kind Ampex 3-track 1/2&quot; tape recorder designed and built by engineer (and Hi-Fi Records label owner) Richard Vaughn. All of Lyman&#x27;s albums were recorded live, without overdubbing. He recorded after midnight, to avoid the sounds of traffic and tourists, and occasionally you can hear the aluminum dome creaking as it settles in the cool night air. Lyman noted that he did not like recording in the dome because of the echo and the outside noise but did so because it was free. At night, after playing in the lounge the band would wheel their instruments over to the dome and record all night. They knew their recording session was over when morning came and the trash trucks started making noise. The quality of these recordings became even more evident with the advent of CD reissues, when the digital mastering engineer found he didn&#x27;t have to do anything to them but transfer the original 3-track stereo masters to digital. The recordings remain state-of-the-art nearly 50 years later.

<text>Newton-le-Willows is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, Merseyside, England. The population at the 2021 census was 24,642. Newton-le-Willows is on the eastern edge of St Helens, south of Wigan and north of Warrington, equidistant to Liverpool and Manchester.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the Newton township was historically largely pastoral lands, with the mining industry encroaching from the north and the west as time went on. The township (often referred to as Newton in Makerfield at that time) is documented since at least the 12th century. In the early 19th century the township saw significant urban development to support the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The presence of the Sankey Canal running through the Sankey Valley necessitated the construction of the Sankey Viaduct by George Stephenson, and the town of Earlestown developed around the industrial works there. Earlestown gradually became the administrative and commercial centre of the township, with the historic market and fairs moving to a purpose built square.

==Name==
Historically, Newton was known as both &quot;Newton-le-Willows&quot; and &quot;Newton in Makerfield&quot; to differentiate it from other towns of the same name. The name Newton means &quot;new town&quot;, while Makerfield is an ancient name for the district from the Brittonic word &quot;mager&quot; meaning &quot;wall&quot; combined with the English word &quot;field&quot;. &quot;Neweton&quot; was mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; while the spelling of Makerfield evolved and was recorded as Makeresfeld in 1205 and 1351, as Makefeld in 1206, Makerefeld in 1213 and Makerfield since 1242.

==History==

Before the Norman Conquest, Newton was head of a hundred. The Domesday hundred was assessed at five hides one of which included Newton. The lord of the manor was Edward the Confessor at his death in 1066. The Newton Hundred was subsequently combined with the Warrington and Derby Hundreds to form the West Derby Hundred.

The fields between Newton and Winwick were the site of the battle of Winwick, the last battle of the Second English Civil War.

Newton has two railway stations. Newton-le-Willows railway station and Earlestown railway station, opened in 1830. They are two of the oldest railway stations. Earlestown was an important junction where the original Liverpool and Manchester Railway line was joined by the 1837 line running south to Birmingham. The town also had three other railway stations, situated at Parkside, the Vulcan Village, and the old racecourse (which closed when Haydock Park Racecourse was opened). Parkside is notable as the site of the world&#x27;s first fatal rail accident, at which a notable MP at the time, William Huskisson died. Two other local railway related landmarks are Newton Viaduct and the Sankey Viaduct which is locally known as the &quot;Nine Arches&quot;.

==Governance==
Forming part of the historic county boundaries of Lancashire from a very early time, Newton-le-Willows is an ancient town. It was initially part of the Fee of Makerfield, which was part of the West Derby Hundred. It was later made a parliamentary borough from 1558 until 1832, one of the earliest in Lancashire. From this date until 1894, the town came under the control of a court leet and improvement commissioners. The developing industrial town was then created into an urban district under the name Newton in Makerfield. The name of the urban district was changed in 1939 to Newton-le-Willows. On 1 April 1974 Newton-le-Willows Urban District Council merged with a number of neighbouring local authorities, to create St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council in the new ceremonial county of Merseyside.

Newton-le-Willows is split into two wards, Newton East and Newton West; each ward returns three councillors to serve on St Helens Borough Council. As of May 2022, the East ward is represented by three Labour councillors, while Newton West has two Independent councillors and one Labour.

==Geography==

Newton-le-Willows is located off the A580 East Lancashire Road between Liverpool and Manchester in north-west England. It is in the east of the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens in Merseyside, near to the border with Wigan in Greater Manchester. To the south is the Borough of Warrington in Cheshire. The wider built-up area of Newton-le-Willows includes Earlestown and areas of Wargrave and Vulcan Village.

The town is considered as part of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area for statistical purposes despite being situated within Merseyside.

==Transport==

The M6 and M62 motorways and A580 East Lancashire Road pass close to the town. This has helped Newton become an important commuter town, now that most of its industry has gone, with the city centres of Manchester and Liverpool also being accessible by train in as little as 18 minutes and 16 minutes respectively. There have as a result been many new housing estates built around the outskirts of the town.

The Sankey Canal passes through the town and is crossed, on the Sankey Viaduct, by the world&#x27;s first passenger railway, also within the boundaries of the town.

Newton-le-Willows and Earlestown railway stations have a regional service with regular trains running to Liverpool and Manchester, St Helens, Warrington, Chester, West Yorkshire and along the North Wales coast to Llandudno. Earlestown is a very large station for the size of the town, with 5 platforms. On platform 2 is the old waiting room, regarded as one of the oldest remaining railway buildings in the world.

There is a small bus station in Tamworth Street, with a number of bus routes running around the town, and out of town services connecting neighbouring Burtonwood, Haydock, Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lowton, Garswood and major towns of Warrington, St. Helens, Wigan and Leigh.

==Religion==
Once part of the ancient parish of Winwick, the town is split into four Anglican parishes, St Peter&#x27;s covering Newton, St John&#x27;s covering Earlestown, Emmanuel covering Wargrave and All Saints&#x27; covering the northern parts of the town.

Similar to other towns in Lancashire, Newton has a large Roman Catholic population and there are three Catholic churches in the town: St Patrick&#x27;s in Earlestown, St Mary and St John&#x27;s in Newton and St David&#x27;s in Wargrave.

There are also other denominations represented in the town, such as the Methodist and Baptist churches in the town centre.

==Local media==
From Victorian times until 2007, the town had a number of local newspapers. The &quot;Newton and Golborne Guardian&quot; was the longest established, which ceased publication in 2007. Other papers to have served the town over the years include the &quot;Earlestown Guardian&quot;, and &quot;Newton Reporter&quot;. The town comes within the distribution area of the &quot;St Helens Star&quot; and &quot;St Helens Reporter&quot;, both free newspapers. The &quot;Warrington Guardian&quot;, &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;, &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; and &quot;Wigan Post&quot; are widely available within the town.

Local radio is provided by WA12Radio an internet-based radio station, founded in 2011 and named after the local postal code. The station is now part of Newton Boys and Girls Club. Regional radio is provided by Heart North West, BBC Radio Merseyside and BBC Radio Manchester.

The town falls within the BBC North West region and Granada region for ITV.

==Sport==
Newton-le-Willows racecourse closed down in 1898 and was replaced by Haydock Park Racecourse. The Old Newton Cup is the world&#x27;s oldest continually competed for trophy, with a history dating back over 200 years.

Football has always been an important sport within the town, and Newton-le-Willows had its own club between 1894 and 1908. Newton-le-Willows F.C. played in the local leagues until the 1900–01 season when the club joined the English Combination where they competed for three years. In 1903–04 season the club joined the Lancashire Combination where their derby matches included Bryn Central and Wigan Town (a forerunner of Wigan Athletic). The club left the league at the end of the 1907–08 season at which point the club folded. Newton-le-Willows home ground was the Pied Bull Ground which was situated behind the public house of the same name and bordered Rob Lane (then Golborne Road), more or less where the Parchments estate lies. 
There has been a couple of spells that Earlestown Football Club has been quite successful. The team competed in the Lancashire Combination league which at the time (1950s/1960s) was the equivalent of today&#x27;s Conference North. Earlestown enjoyed a local rivalry with a number of teams which would go on to national prominence, especially Wigan Athletic. Earlestown was a very ambitious club who hit the headlines when they signed Wilf Mannion as player manager. Crowds of one or two thousand were not unknown for local derbies. However, falling gates and the cost of a professional squad forced the club into bankruptcy in the mid 1960s. In its earlier history, Earlestown F.C. created a few pieces of history, including being defeated by Everton in the Liverpool Cup which was the Toffees&#x27; first cup final victory. A year later, Earlestown won the final beating an Everton side that would help form the football league just three years later. Earlestown also played Everton in the first ever match at Anfield stadium. A number of smaller teams operated in the town, the most prominent being Vulcan Newton who have previously been in the Lancashire Combination and North West Counties League.

The area is very popular for rugby league, with St Helens R.F.C., Warrington Wolves, Widnes Vikings, Wigan Warriors, Salford Red Devils and Leigh Leopards all being local teams. However, Newton-le-Willows never had a rugby league team until 2002, with the formation of Newton Storm RLFC. Storm has become one of the fastest-growing amateur rugby league clubs in the north-west. 
Rugby union was historically the most popular code in the town, with two teams, Newton-le-Willows RUFC and Vulcan RUFC being prominent teams in the South Lancashire and Cheshire leagues. The most prominent players in the past have been former England and British Lions international Fran Cotton, and Wigan player Steve Hampson.

Cricket is now the major sport in the town, with Newton C.C. playing in the Premier Division of the Liverpool Competition, a major north west league with teams stretching from the Fylde coast to North Wales competing in it. Vulcan C.C. also represent the town on a more localised level. Newton has produced a number of players who have progressed onto Lancashire County Cricket Club.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===
Quaid has been married four times and has three children. He met his first wife, actress P. J. Soles, on the set of the film &quot;Our Winning Season&quot;. They were married in 1978 and divorced in 1983.

On February 14, 1991, Quaid married actress Meg Ryan. Quaid and Ryan fell in love during the shooting of their second film together, &quot;D.O.A.&quot; They have a son, Jack Quaid (born 1992). Quaid and Ryan announced their separation on June 28, 2000, saying they had been separated six weeks by then. Their divorce was finalized in July 2001.

Quaid dated model Shanna Moakler from February to October 2001.

Quaid married Texas real estate agent Kimberly Buffington on July 4, 2004, at his ranch in Paradise Valley, Montana. They have fraternal twins who were born via a surrogate on November 8, 2007, in Santa Monica, California.

On November 18, 2007, hospital staff mistakenly gave Quaid&#x27;s 10-day-old twins a dosage of heparin (a blood thinner) that was 1,000 times the common dosage for infants. The babies recovered, but Quaid filed a lawsuit against the drug manufacturer, Baxter Healthcare, claiming that packaging for the two doses of heparin are not different enough. In May 2008, the Quaids testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, asking the U.S. Congress not to preempt the right to sue drug manufacturers for negligence under state law. The incident led Quaid to become a patient-safety advocate, producing a series of documentaries on preventable medical errors that aired on the Discovery Channel, as well as co-authoring a medical-journal article addressing the positive influence of patient stories in motivating change in healthcare. The first documentary, &quot;Chasing Zero: Winning the War on Healthcare Harm&quot;, aired on the Discovery Channel in 2010, and the second documentary, &quot;Surfing the Healthcare Tsunami: Bring Your Best Board&quot;, aired on the Discovery Channel in 2012.

Buffington filed for divorce from Quaid in March 2012. Buffington&#x27;s attorney then withdrew the divorce papers on April 26, 2012. That summer, Quaid and Buffington moved to California. In October 2012, he and Buffington again decided to separate, and Buffington filed for legal separation, seeking joint legal and sole physical custody of the twins. After waiting to establish the required six months of residency in California, Quaid filed for divorce on November 30, 2012, asking for joint legal and physical custody of the children and offering to pay spousal support to Buffington. They then reconciled, and the divorce was dismissed by September 2013. On June 28, 2016, the couple announced in a joint statement that they were divorcing, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; as the reason, with Buffington asking for full physical custody and joint legal custody. The divorce was finalized on April 27, 2018.

Following his separation from Buffington, Quaid dated model Santa Auzina from July 2016 to 2019.

On October 21, 2019, Quaid confirmed his engagement to Laura Savoie. Their original wedding plans were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and they married on June 2, 2020, in Santa Barbara. Savoie is a CPA and yoga instructor, 39 years his junior, who shares his Christian faith. Quaid says, &quot;God is in the relationship. I&#x27;ve never had a relationship like that before.&quot; Together, they launched the production company Bonniedale Films, based in Nashville, where they live.

===Religious beliefs===
Quaid is a Christian, coming to faith around 1990 after struggling with addiction. He wrote the Christian song &quot;On My Way to Heaven&quot;, dedicated to his mother and included in the film &quot;I Can Only Imagine&quot;, in which Quaid starred.

===Interests===
In addition to acting, Quaid is a musician and plays with his band, the Sharks. Quaid wrote and performed the song &quot;Closer to You&quot; in the film &quot;The Big Easy&quot; (1987). He also has a pilot&#x27;s license and owned a Cessna Citation. Quaid is also a one-handicap golfer, and in 2005, he was named the top golfer among the &quot;Hollywood set&quot; by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine.

Quaid is a fan of the Houston Astros, and after the team&#x27;s 2005 National League Championship–winning season, he narrated their commemorative DVD release. After the filming of &quot;The Express: The Ernie Davis Story&quot;, Quaid went to Cleveland Browns Stadium to dedicate Davis&#x27;s jersey.

Quaid began podcasting in 2020, starting &quot;The Pet Show with Dennis Quaid and Jimmy Jellinek&quot;. Its first episode premiered on July 10, 2020. During that podcast, Quaid learned of a shelter cat in Lynchburg, Virginia, also named Dennis Quaid. He adopted the cat and flew it out to California to live at his recording studio.

===Substance use===
There have been extensive stories about Quaid&#x27;s past abuse of cocaine. In a 2002 interview with Larry King on his talk show, after King asked about his motives for using drugs, Quaid responded, &quot;Well, you got to put it in context. Back in the late 1960s, early 1970s. That was back during the time where, you know, drugs were going to expand our minds and everybody was experimenting and everything. We were really getting high, we didn&#x27;t know it. And cocaine at that time was considered harmless. You know. I remember magazine articles in &quot;People&quot; magazine of doctors saying it is not addicting. It is just—alcohol is worse. So I think we all fell into that. But that&#x27;s not the way it was.&quot;

When Quaid was asked if he believed he had ever been addicted to the drugs, Quaid responded, &quot;It was a gradual thing. But it got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t have any fun unless I had it. Which is a bad place to be.&quot; Later in the interview, he said, &quot;But I saw myself being dead in about five years if I didn&#x27;t stop.&quot;

===Political views===
In a 2018 interview with the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Quaid stated he was a registered independent and has voted for both Democratic and Republican candidates, saying that he did not consider himself an adherent to any particular ideology; though he did opine that Ronald Reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Quaid stated that President Donald Trump was handling the pandemic well, calling him &quot;involved.&quot; Quaid subsequently recorded an interview with infectious-disease expert Anthony Fauci as part of an advertising campaign by the Department of Health and Human Services to &quot;defeat despair&quot; surrounding COVID-19.

In May 2024, Quaid endorsed Donald Trump for president during an interview on &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored,&quot; and later appeared at a rally with the former president.

<doc id="314564" wikidata="Q5455111" url="?curid=314564" title="Fishman Affidavit">
<text>The Fishman Affidavit is a set of court documents submitted by self-professed ex-Scientologist Steven Fishman in 1993 in the federal case, &quot;Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz&quot; (Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx) United States District Court for the Central District of California).

The affidavit contained criticisms of the Church of Scientology and substantial portions of the Operating Thetan auditing and course materials.

==&quot;Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz&quot;==
The documents were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on 9 April 1993 as part of &quot;Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz&quot;. Along with Kendrick Moxon and Laurie Bartilson, Timothy Bowles was one of the lead attorneys for the Church of Scientology in the case.

Fishman told the court that he had committed crimes on behalf of the Church. He also attested that he was assigned to murder his psychologist, Uwe Geertz, and then commit suicide. Fishman received a mail fraud conviction three years earlier, and he claimed being brainwashed by the Church and that he had committed the crime to cover the cost of his Scientology sessions. The court rejected Fishman&#x27;s defense and he was soon after sued for libel by Scientology.

As evidence, Fishman submitted course materials he said that he purchased from Ellie Bolger, a fellow Scientologist, and Richard Ofshe, an expert witness for his defense. The Church says the documents were stolen and considers them to be copyrighted and a trade secret. Among other materials, the affidavit contains 61 pages of the allegedly trade-secret and copyrighted story of Xenu.

The Fishman Affidavit contains much text from the old versions of the Operating Thetan levels. The versions of OT I to OT VII in the Fishman Affidavit are considered authentic as the church&#x27;s Religious Technology Center (RTC) brought copyright lawsuits over their release on the Internet. Fishman&#x27;s description of OT VIII contains what many interpret as the accusation that Jesus was a pedophile. After initially asserting copyright to all the OT level descriptions in the affidavit, RTC amended its claim to remove the OT VIII description, calling it a forgery. Fishman stated that he had obtained his copy of OT VIII from Ofshe, a different source than his copies of the other OT Levels, purchased from a fellow Scientologist.

The Church of Scientology dropped its libel case against Fishman and Geertz in 1994.

An important side aspect of the case was that several high-ranking Scientology officials and lead attorneys for the organization and former high-ranking Scientologists submitted declarations on their activities for the Church of Scientology, giving thereby insight into the internal ongoings of the Scientology management.

Among others, declarations were submitted by:

* Richard Aznaran &amp; Vicki Aznaran, former executives of the Religious Technology Center
* Jonathan Epstein, at that time International Finance Director of the Church of Scientology International
* Guillaume Lesevre, at that time Executive Director International of the Church of Scientology International
* David Miscavige, Chairman of the Board of the Religious Technology Center
* Raymond Mithoff, at that time Senior Case Supervisor International of the Church of Scientology International
* Thomas Spring, tax attorney for the Church of Scientology International
* Norman Starkey, at that time executive director of Author Services Inc.
* André Tabayoyon, ex-Scientologist and former security official of the Church of Scientology International
* William Walsh, attorney for different organizations of the Church of Scientology
* Marc Yager, at that time Chairman of the Watchdog Committee of the Church of Scientology International
* Monique Yingling, tax attorney for the Church of Scientology International
* Robert Vaughn Young, former spokesperson for the Guardian&#x27;s Office and Author Services Inc.
* Stacy Brooks Young, former official of the U.S. Office of Special Affairs

==Posting to the Internet==
Although the Church of Scientology attempted to prevent others from receiving the document by continuously borrowing it, the text of this declaration and its exhibits were scanned, converted to text, and posted onto the Usenet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology by ex-Scientologist Arnie Lerma. The material was then placed on the World Wide Web by David S. Touretzky.

Lerma&#x27;s newsgroup posting resulted in the August 1995 raid of his home for copyright violation on the materials, and the resulting lawsuit &quot;Religious Technology Center (Scientology) vs Arnaldo Lerma, Richard Leiby, and The Washington Post&quot;. U.S. Federal Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that while Richard Leiby and the Washington Post had not violated copyright, Lerma was liable and fined $2,500 but with no costs awarded to Scientology. Judge Brinkema also stated that the primary motivation for the case was &quot;to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics.&quot;

After being posted to the newsgroup, the documents were mirrored on hundreds of websites worldwide. The Church of Scientology responded by suing a number of people and their Internet service providers for copyright infringement. The defendants responded by challenging the church to prove it was actually the copyright holder of the disputed documents.

The other notable case in connection with this was against Dutch writer Karin Spaink. The Church brought suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material, and claimed rewordings would reveal a trade secret. In 2003, Spaink won the case, with the court holding that her quotation of Scientology works was acceptable and expressing concern about Scientology&#x27;s attempts to prevent discussion of its doctrines. The Church appealed but dropped the case after a negative advice on the appeal from the Attorney-General to the court in March 2005. In December 2005, the court dismissed the appeal, making the previous ruling final. The Church has no further possibility for appeal due to their dropping the case. The ruling also reversed earlier decisions affecting hyperlinking.

Critics of the church have accused it of intentionally using lawsuits in these and other cases as SLAPP suits, intended to silence their opposition. Critics of Steven Fishman have produced the affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, a Scientology executive, which states that Fishman received services from a Scientology mission, did a few introductory courses, never worked for the Church or CCHR, and did not get any auditing or do any courses at the main Miami church, which would conflict with his claims. Vicki Aznaran, a former Scientologist who was involved in anti-Scientology litigation before retracting her claims as part of a settlement with Scientology, gave a declaration through Scientology attorneys in which she states various allegations made by Steven Fishman and other church critics are untrue, contradicting her previous declaration given in &quot;CSI v. Fishman and Geertz&quot;.

==Fishman&#x27;s relationship to the Church of Scientology==

A great deal of controversy with regards to Fishman&#x27;s involvement with the Church of Scientology has arisen in the decades following the case. Initially, the allegations questioning Fishman&#x27;s involvement came solely from the Church itself and their legal team, who pursued the libel suit recognizing that he was not in their records. In 2015, notable Scientology critic Tony Ortega published an exposé on the affair; in which he characterizes Fishman as a “squirrel” or Independent Scientologist. He describes Fishman as follows:

In addition to there being no listed Scientology completions for Steven Fishman ever published, many now ex-Scientologists mentioned in his book, &quot;Lonesome Squirrel&quot;, have categorically refuted the events of the book mentioning them, and denied having known him altogether. Fishman has long asserted that he received OT levels I-VII and VIII respectively from two Sea Org members. Although Ortega professes skepticism regarding this, he states he believes the document to be authentic nonetheless.

<doc id="314566" wikidata="Q916387" url="?curid=314566" title="Exotica">
<text>Exotica is a musical genre that was popular during the 1950s to mid-1960s with Americans who came of age during World War II. The term was coined by Simon &quot;Si&quot; Waronker, Liberty Records co-founder and board chairman, named after the 1957 Martin Denny album &quot;Exotica&quot;. The musical colloquialism &quot;exotica&quot; means tropical ersatz, the non-native, pseudo experience of insular Oceania, Southeast Asia, Hawaii, the Amazon basin, the Andes, the Caribbean and tribal Africa. Denny described the musical style as &quot;a combination of the South Pacific and the Orient...what a lot of people imagined the islands to be like...it&#x27;s pure fantasy though.&quot; While the South Seas forms the core region, exotica reflects the &quot;musical impressions&quot; of every place from standard travel destinations to the mythical &quot;shangri-las&quot; dreamt of by armchair safari-ers.

==History==

Les Baxter&#x27;s album &quot;Ritual of the Savage&quot; (&quot;Le Sacre du Sauvage&quot;) was released in 1952 and would become a cornerstone of exotica. This album featured lush orchestral arrangements along with tribal rhythms and offered such classics as &quot;Quiet Village&quot;, &quot;Jungle River Boat&quot;, &quot;Love Dance&quot;, and &quot;Stone God.&quot; &quot;Ritual&quot; is the seminal exotica record, influencing all that came after it. As the 1950s progressed, Baxter carved out a niche in this area, producing a number of titles in this style including &quot;Tamboo!&quot; (1956), &quot;Caribbean Moonlight&quot; (1956), &quot;Ports of Pleasure&quot; (1957), &quot;The Sacred Idol&quot; (1960) and &quot;Jewels of the Sea&quot; (1961). Baxter claimed Ravel and Stravinsky as influences on his work.

In 1957, Martin Denny covered Les Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Quiet Village&quot;, with exotic bird calls and a vibraphone instead of strings, which established the sound of the Polynesian styled music. The song reached #2 on Billboard&#x27;s charts in 1959 with Denny&#x27;s &quot;Exotica&quot; album reaching #1. Soon the new technology of stereo further opened up the musical palettes of Denny and other prominent exotica artists such as Arthur Lyman and Juan García Esquivel.

The distinctive sound of exotica relies on a variety of instruments: conga, bongos, vibes, Indonesian and Burmese gongs, boo bams (bamboo sticks), Tahitian log, Chinese bell tree, and Japanese kotos. Additionally intrinsic to the sound of exotica are bird calls, big-cat roars, and even primate shrieks, which invoke the dangers of the jungle. Though there are some standards which contain lyrics (including those by Yma Sumac), singing is rare. Abstract, siren-like ululations, chants, vocalized animal calls, and guttural growls are common.

The music of American composer Raymond Scott is sometimes recognized as a precursor to exotica, as several of his songs were written with the intent of transporting the listener to exotic locations via novelty instruments and sound effects.

As a result of the popularity of exotica during the late 1950s, a large number of records were released that featured covers of recently released exotica songs (mainly by Les Baxter) and Hawaiian and easy-listening standards. These recordings include &quot;Exotica&quot; by Ted Auletta, &quot;Exotic Percussion&quot; by Stanley Black and his Orchestra, &quot;Orienta&quot; by Gerald Fried, &quot;Taboo&quot; and &quot;Taboo 2&quot; by Arthur Lyman and &quot;The Sounds of Exotic Island&quot; by The Surfmen. Some composers pushed the bounds of the genre by producing albums of original content, often with unusual instrumentation. These recordings include &quot;Voodoo&quot; by Robert Drasnin, &quot;Africana&quot; by Chaino, &quot;Pagan Festival&quot; by Dominic Frontiere And His Orchestra, and &quot;White Goddess&quot; by Frank Hunter. By 1959, the majority of American record labels had released at least one exotica-themed album, usually utilizing composers and musicians that produced jazz, classical or easy listening recordings.

After several years of rising excitement leading up to Hawaii becoming a state in 1959, the Hawaiiana fad waned in the United States and so did exotica&#x27;s commercial appeal. CD re-issues ignited a revival in the early 1990s.

==Revival==
In 1971 Roger Roger and Nino Nardini released the album &quot;Jungle Obsession&quot; on the French Neuilly record label. Intended as a sound library recording, it soon took on a life of its own. Although clearly influenced by the exotica arrangements of Baxter, Martin Denny, Frank Hunter and Dick Hyman, it went beyond the simpler themes used by those composers to employ &quot;a series of motifs, leitmotifs, and modes that were out of the musical sphere at the time: they took rock and classical and bossa and jazz and easy listening, wove them together with polyrhythmic invention and a boatload of sound effects&quot;.

In the 1990s exotica resurfaced more generally, along with a new category in which to place the genre: lounge. Dozens of long out-of-print LPs were reissued on CD. The revival accompanied a related swing revival and general appreciation for tiki culture. A new crop of bands, such as Pink Martini, were influenced by the classic albums, and Combustible Edison for one featured songs like &quot;Breakfast at Denny&#x27;s&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek title for a song styled on the music of Martin Denny.

The early 2000s saw additional exotica revival efforts, such as Hawaii-based Don Tiki, the comeback of 1960s composer Robert Drasnin, Waitiki, The Martini Kings, The Tikiyaki Orchestra, Kava Kon, and Hawaii Music Award winning Tiki Joe&#x27;s Ocean, formed by multi-instrumentalist/composer Andy Nazzal. The Florida-based ensemble called Stolen Idols followed in the tradition of Robert Drasnin by playing new music composed by their leader, Drew Farmer, along with some reinterpreted classics. Their album &quot;Moonlight Offerings&quot; was a welcome contribution to the genre. They were for a few years regular performers at the Hukilau festival. After a lengthy hiatus, they have recently come back together. 

Several podcasts broadcast classic and new exotica and tiki revival music. In late 2024, San Francisco online radio station SOMA FM started a tiki and exotica-focused stream called Tiki Time.

<doc id="314575" wikidata="Q166080" url="?curid=314575" title="Octagon">
<text>In geometry, an octagon () is an eight-sided polygon or 8-gon.

A &quot;regular octagon&quot; has Schläfli symbol {8} and can also be constructed as a quasiregular truncated square, t{4}, which alternates two types of edges. A truncated octagon, t{8} is a hexadecagon, {16}. A 3D analog of the octagon can be the rhombicuboctahedron with the triangular faces on it like the replaced edges, if one considers the octagon to be a truncated square.

==Properties==

The sum of all the internal angles of any octagon is 1080°. As with all polygons, the external angles total 360°.

If squares are constructed all internally or all externally on the sides of an octagon, then the midpoints of the segments connecting the centers of opposite squares form a quadrilateral that is both equidiagonal and orthodiagonal (that is, whose diagonals are equal in length and at right angles to each other).

The midpoint octagon of a reference octagon has its eight vertices at the midpoints of the sides of the reference octagon. If squares are constructed all internally or all externally on the sides of the midpoint octagon, then the midpoints of the segments connecting the centers of opposite squares themselves form the vertices of a square.

===Regularity===
A regular octagon is a closed figure with sides of the same length and internal angles of the same size. It has eight lines of reflective symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 8. A regular octagon is represented by the Schläfli symbol {8}.
The internal angle at each vertex of a regular octagon is 135° (formula_1 radians). The central angle is 45° (formula_2 radians).

=== Area ===
The area of a regular octagon of side length &quot;a&quot; is given by
:formula_3

In terms of the circumradius &quot;R&quot;, the area is
:formula_4

In terms of the apothem &quot;r&quot; (see also inscribed figure), the area is
:formula_5

These last two coefficients bracket the value of pi, the area of the unit circle.
The area can also be expressed as
:formula_6

where &quot;S&quot; is the span of the octagon, or the second-shortest diagonal; and &quot;a&quot; is the length of one of the sides, or bases. This is easily proven if one takes an octagon, draws a square around the outside (making sure that four of the eight sides overlap with the four sides of the square) and then takes the corner triangles (these are 45–45–90 triangles) and places them with right angles pointed inward, forming a square. The edges of this square are each the length of the base.

Given the length of a side &quot;a&quot;, the span &quot;S&quot; is
:formula_7
The span, then, is equal to the &quot;silver ratio&quot; times the side, a.

The area is then as above:
:formula_8

Expressed in terms of the span, the area is
:formula_9

Another simple formula for the area is 
:formula_10

More often the span &quot;S&quot; is known, and the length of the sides, &quot;a&quot;, is to be determined, as when cutting a square piece of material into a regular octagon. From the above,
:formula_11

The two end lengths &quot;e&quot; on each side (the leg lengths of the triangles (green in the image) truncated from the square), as well as being formula_12 may be calculated as
:formula_13

===Circumradius and inradius===

The circumradius of the regular octagon in terms of the side length &quot;a&quot; is

:formula_14

and the inradius is

:formula_15
(that is one-half the &quot;silver ratio&quot; times the side, &quot;a&quot;, or one-half the span, &quot;S&quot;)

The inradius can be calculated from the circumradius as
:formula_16

===Diagonality===
The regular octagon, in terms of the side length &quot;a&quot;, has three different types of diagonals:

*Short diagonal;
*Medium diagonal (also called span or height), which is twice the length of the inradius;
*Long diagonal, which is twice the length of the circumradius.

The formula for each of them follows from the basic principles of geometry. Here are the formulas for their length:

*Short diagonal: formula_17 ;
*Medium diagonal: formula_18 ; (&quot;silver ratio&quot; times a) 
*Long diagonal: formula_19 .

===Construction===

A regular octagon at a given circumcircle may be constructed as follows:
#Draw a circle and a diameter AOE, where O is the center and A, E are points on the circumcircle.
#Draw another diameter GOC, perpendicular to AOE.
#(Note in passing that A,C,E,G are vertices of a square).
#Draw the bisectors of the right angles GOA and EOG, making two more diameters HOD and FOB.
#A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H are the vertices of the octagon.

A regular octagon can be constructed using a straightedge and a compass, as 8 = 23, a power of two:

The regular octagon can be constructed with meccano bars. Twelve bars of size 4, three bars of size 5 and two bars of size 6 are required.
Each side of a regular octagon subtends half a right angle at the centre of the circle which connects its vertices. Its area can thus be computed as the sum of eight isosceles triangles, leading to the result:

:formula_20

for an octagon of side &quot;a&quot;.

===Standard coordinates===
The coordinates for the vertices of a regular octagon centered at the origin and with side length 2 are:
*(±1, ±(1+)) 
*(±(1+), ±1).

===Dissectibility===
Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2&quot;m&quot;-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into &quot;m&quot;(&quot;m&quot;-1)/2 parallelograms.
In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the &quot;regular octagon&quot;, &quot;m&quot;=4, and it can be divided into 6 rhombs, with one example shown below. This decomposition can be seen as 6 of 24 faces in a Petrie polygon projection plane of the tesseract. The list defines the number of solutions as eight, by the eight orientations of this one dissection. These squares and rhombs are used in the Ammann–Beenker tilings.
== Skew ==

A skew octagon is a skew polygon with eight vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an octagon is not generally defined. A &quot;skew zig-zag octagon&quot; has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.

A regular skew octagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In three dimensions it is a zig-zag skew octagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a square antiprism with the same D4d, [2+,8] symmetry, order 16.

===Petrie polygons===
The regular skew octagon is the Petrie polygon for these higher-dimensional regular and uniform polytopes, shown in these skew orthogonal projections of in A7, B4, and D5 Coxeter planes.
==Symmetry==

The &quot;regular octagon&quot; has Dih8 symmetry, order 16. There are three dihedral subgroups: Dih4, Dih2, and Dih1, and four cyclic subgroups: Z8, Z4, Z2, and Z1, the last implying no symmetry.
On the regular octagon, there are eleven distinct symmetries. John Conway labels full symmetry as r16. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars) Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders. Full symmetry of the regular form is r16 and no symmetry is labeled a1.

The most common high symmetry octagons are p8, an isogonal octagon constructed by four mirrors can alternate long and short edges, and d8, an isotoxal octagon constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular octagon.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g8 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.
==Use==

The octagonal shape is used as a design element in architecture. The Dome of the Rock has a characteristic octagonal plan. The Tower of the Winds in Athens is another example of an octagonal structure. The octagonal plan has also been in church architecture such as St. George&#x27;s Cathedral, Addis Ababa, Basilica of San Vitale (in Ravenna, Italia), Castel del Monte (Apulia, Italia), Florence Baptistery, Zum Friedefürsten Church (Germany) and a number of octagonal churches in Norway. The central space in the Aachen Cathedral, the Carolingian Palatine Chapel, has a regular octagonal floorplan. Uses of octagons in churches also include lesser design elements, such as the octagonal apse of Nidaros Cathedral.

Architects such as John Andrews have used octagonal floor layouts in buildings for functionally separating office areas from building services, such as in the Intelsat Headquarters of Washington or Callam Offices in Canberra.

<text>Edge Hill is a district of Liverpool, England, south east of the city centre, bordered by Kensington, Wavertree and Toxteth.

Edge Hill University was founded here, but moved to Ormskirk in the 1930s.

==History==
The area was first developed in the late 18th-early 19th century Georgian era. Many of the Georgian houses of the time still survive. Edge Hill was designated a Conservation Area in 1979. Most of the Georgian property around St. Mary&#x27;s Church is now English Heritage listed. The later terraces, of the Victorian era, have also largely been demolished. Although some modern housing has been built, the area still has a depopulated appearance, with many vacant lots and derelict pubs and shops.

Joseph Williamson (1769–1840), a tobacco magnate, was responsible for much of the building in the area in the early 19th century. The &quot;Mole of Edge Hill&quot; employed hundreds of men to construct the Williamson Tunnels beneath the area. Part of the tunnel network is now open to the public as a tourist attraction.

In the early 19th century, Edge Hill was the site of two railway works. Both the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Grand Junction Railway initially set up workshops, but with restricted expansion as the business grew, the Grand Junction Railway moved its main locomotive production to Crewe in 1843. Locomotives continued to be built at Edge Hill until 1851. Liverpool and Manchester were absorbed by the Grand Junction in 1845, which in turn became part of the London and North Western Railway in 1846.

The first Edge Hill station was built in 1830 on a site about 150m from its present location. Of this little remains. There was a &quot;Moorish Arch&quot; with a stationary engine hauling trains up and down from Crown Street Station until locomotive-hauled trains were able to cope with the gradient. The current station dates from 1836 when the main city railway terminus was moved to Lime Street. The station retains its original buildings but is very quiet owing to the sheer lack of population or industry in the area. These buildings are the oldest in the world and are still open to the public at working railway stations.

Formerly all trains stopped at Edge Hill at the entrance to the tunnel to Lime Street station, giving rise to &quot;getting off at Edge Hill&quot; as a euphemism for coitus interruptus.

A local school on Durning Road, the Ernest Brown Junior Instructional College, was the site of one of the worst civilian bombings of the Second World War. On 29 November 1940, a parachute mine dropped by the Luftwaffe exploded on the building which was being used as an air raid shelter by 300 people. The structure collapsed on itself and destroyed boilers and furnaces inside, which spilled into the shelter. This resulted in many suffering extreme burns or being boiled alive. There was further damage and loss of life when nearby gas mains exploded. Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, referred to the incident as &quot;the single worst civilian incident of the war&quot;. 166 people were killed with many more physically and mentally injured. Survivors suffered severe psychological trauma for many years afterwards.

Edge Hill was the site of huge railway marshalling yards until the 1970s, sorting trains to and from the docks via the Victoria Tunnel and Wapping Tunnel to Park Lane and Waterloo goods stations on the dockside.

Crown Street Resource Centre is a mental health resource centre in Edge Hill that opened in 1982 and is run by Liverpool social services and Merseycare for people living in the Liverpool city area.

Edge Hill University began work in the area in 1885 as a teacher training college, though it moved to its current Ormskirk site in 1933.

==Notable residents==
Herbert Rowse Armstrong, the Hay poisoner, lived at 52 Durning Road, Edge Hill whilst practising as a solicitor in the city.

Patrick Mahon, convicted of the 1924 murder of Emily Kaye at the Crumbles, Eastbourne, grew up on Helena Street. The site of the street is now covered by a DIY store car park.

The actor Chris Mason was born in Edge Hill.

Elon Musk&#x27;s grandmother, Cora Robinson, was born at 36 Bridge Road, Edge Hill in 1923 and lived there until c1939.

<doc id="314603" wikidata="Q844005" url="?curid=314603" title="Game Developer (magazine)">
<text>Game Developer was a magazine for video game creators, originally started in March 1994 by Miller Freeman, Inc as quarterly, later bimonthly, and finally monthly. In each issue, industry leaders and experts shared technical solutions, reviewed new game development tools, and discussed strategies for creating innovative, successful video games. Monthly postmortems dissected the industry&#x27;s leading games, from AAA console to social and mobile games and beyond, and columns gave insight into deeper development practices from across all disciplines, from design, to programming, to art, to business, and audio. It was closed in 2013 as part of a restructuring at parent company UBM Tech (part of UBM plc) that included the closing of all print publications owned by that company.

==Contents==

The magazine contained articles on professional game development topics relating to game programming, art, audio, quality control, design, and production. Monthly columns from industry veterans offered in depth discussion on a variety of topics. It had articles by notable video game industry figures and reviews on game development related books, tools, and software packages. The back page &quot;Soapbox&quot; was also a popular feature but moved to sister site to Gamasutra circa 2004. It was replaced by a splash art page called &quot;Thousand Words&quot; and then replaced again with a regular column &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.

&quot;Game Developer&quot;&#x27;s most popular feature was probably its monthly &quot;Postmortem&quot; column which discusses the recent development of a video game with the top five each of &quot;What Went Right&quot; and &quot;What Went Wrong&quot;. It provided a frank, first-hand account of the lessons learned in the development process. The first Postmortem was featured in October 1997 and written by Andre Vrignaud on &quot;Dark Sun Online&quot;.

Starting in 1998, &quot;Game Developer&quot; recognized exceptional game development tools with their &quot;Front Line Awards&quot; which were given annually. Winners included software (such as Photoshop and VTune), game engines (Unreal Engine), middleware (Havok physics), hardware (GeForce 3), and books (&quot;Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice&quot;).

&quot;Gamasutra&quot;, the sister publication web site of &quot;Game Developer&quot;, acts as an online resource for game developers, as well as a job posting board for employment in the game development field. It was not part of the closure that resulted in &quot;Game Developer&quot;&#x27;s cessation and continued some features from the magazine. &quot;Gamasutra&quot; rebranded itself to &quot;Game Developer&quot; on August 26, 2021.

<doc id="314604" wikidata="Q434824" url="?curid=314604" title="Rick Barry">
<text>Richard Francis Dennis Barry III (born March 28, 1944) is an American former professional basketball player who starred at the NCAA, American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA) levels. Barry ranks among the most prolific scorers and all-around players in basketball history. He is the only player to lead the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), ABA, and NBA in points per game in a season. He ranks as the all-time ABA scoring leader in regular season (30.5 points per game) and postseason (33.5) play, while his 36.3 points per game are the most in NBA Finals history.

Barry is widely known for his unorthodox underhand free throw technique. His career .880 free throw percentage ranks No. 1 in ABA history, and his .900 percentage was the best of any NBA player at the time of his retirement in 1980. In 1987, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1996, he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. In October 2021, Barry was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

Barry is the father of former professional basketball players Brent Barry, Jon Barry, Drew Barry, and Scooter Barry, and current professional player Canyon Barry. His wife, Lynn Norenberg Barry, was a star basketball player at the College of William &amp; Mary, where she became the first female athlete to have her jersey number (22) retired.

==Early life==
Barry was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey and grew up in nearby Roselle Park, an urban middle-class community. As a fifth-grader, he played with the varsity basketball team, for which his father Aldo served as coach, however, baseball was his best sport and he was a fan of local New York Giants superstar Willie Mays, who wore jersey number 24. Barry would wear the same number in tribute to the outfielder throughout his basketball career. In 1962, he graduated from Roselle Park High School in Roselle Park, New Jersey.

==College career==
Barry fielded more than 30 scholarship offers before he chose the University of Miami, largely because the Hurricanes adhered to an up-tempo, pro-style system under head coach Bruce Hale that was conducive to his skills set and athleticism. It was there that the three-time All-American met his future wife Pamela, who was the daughter of the head coach. In the 1964–65 campaign, the senior led the NCAA with a 37.4 points per game average. He and his teammates did not take part in the NCAA Tournament, however, because the Hurricanes&#x27; program was on probation at the time.

Barry was drafted by the San Francisco Warriors with the second pick of the 1965 NBA draft.

Barry was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1976, and his number 24 jersey is one of only two to have been retired by the Hurricanes.

==Professional career==
===San Francisco Warriors (1965–1967)===

In Barry&#x27;s first season in the NBA with the San Francisco Warriors, the team made a quantum leap from 17 to 35 victories and was in playoff contention until the final game of the regular season.

Nicknamed the &quot;Miami Greyhound&quot; by longtime San Francisco Bay Area broadcaster Bill King because of his long and slender physical build, whippet-like quickness, and remarkable instincts, the Barry won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 25.7 points and 10.6 rebounds per game in the 1965–66 season. The following year, he won the 1967 NBA All-Star Game MVP award with a 38-point outburst as the West team stunned the East team that featured Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell and head coach Red Auerbach, among other all-time greats. He also led the NBA in scoring with a 35.6 point per game average, which currently ranks as the eighth-highest single season ppg average in league history.

Along with All-Star center Nate Thurmond, Barry carried the Warriors to the 1967 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in six highly competitive games, something that Russell and the Boston Celtics could not do in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Despite an injured left knee that required cortisone shots on game days, Barry averaged 40.8 points per game in the series, an NBA Finals record that stood for three decades. &quot;The guy was so good that we had to have three different guys guard him at different times,&quot; Wilt Chamberlain said. &quot;&#x27;Cause he would run them all ragged.&quot;

===Joining the ABA (1968–1972)===
At odds with Warriors owner Franklin Mieuli over unpaid incentive monies due him, Barry moved to the ABA&#x27;s Oakland Oaks (owned by singer Pat Boone), who overwhelmed him with a historic contract offer. Bruce Hale, who coached at Miami and was Barry&#x27;s father-in-law, was tapped to serve as head coach. Barry became the first marquee NBA player to jump to the rival league. Barry signed for a salary of $75,000 along with 15 percent ownership of the Oaks and 5 percent of Oaks&#x27; gate receipts above $600,000. When asked about the deal, he stated, &quot;I know what a lot of people think of me. They call me a traitor. Is that fair? If they would just look at it the same way they do their own businesses. This is the way I support my family. Why should I be called unloyal? They change their jobs and nobody says they&#x27;re unloyal. If everything was based just on loyalty, no one would ever make any money.&quot;

At the time, all NBA teams had one-year options on player contracts and the Warriors were quick to exercise theirs. The courts ordered Barry to sit out the 1967–68 season for the Oaks, upholding the validity of the reserve clause in his Warriors contract. Barry&#x27;s court case preceded by two years that of St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; outfielder Curt Flood, whose own challenge to the reserve clause went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although Flood&#x27;s challenge is better known, Barry was in fact the first American professional athlete to bring a court action against a major league. The ensuing publicity cast Barry in a negative light, portraying him as selfish and money hungry. He was hardly alone in his vision, however, as numerous NBA players also saw the rival league as a rare opportunity to enhance their careers.

====Oakland Oaks (1968–1969)====

The Oaks finished 22–56 in their ABA debut, which Barry spent as part of their broadcast team. Prior to the 1968–69 season, they hired his former San Francisco Warriors coach Alex Hannum to replace Hale, who moved to a front office position. If there was any question about whether Barry would remain the most dominant player in professional basketball, he quickly answered it. In his ABA debut, he averaged a league-high 34.0 points per game and the Oaks became the first West Coast team to capture a league championship in professional basketball history. Barry also paced the league in free-throw percentage in the regular season, a feat he would repeat in the 1970–71 and 1971–72 seasons.

Barry had his season come to an abrupt halt on December 27, 1968, when late in a game against the New York Nets, he was blindsided by Ken Wilburn on a drive to the basket and tore left knee ligaments on the play. He attempted to come back in January 1969, only to aggravate the injury and sit out the remainder of the season. He took part in only 35 games but still was named to the ABA All-Star team.

Even without the arguably the best all-around player in basketball, the Oaks barely skipped a beat. They finished with a 60–18 record under Hannum, dominating the Western Division by 14 games over the second-place New Orleans Buccaneers. In the 1969 ABA Playoffs, the Oaks ousted the Denver Rockets in a seven-game series then swept the Buccaneers in the Western Division finals. In the championship round, they made short work of the Indiana Pacers, 4–1, to capture the league title.
In lieu of a parade in downtown Oakland, a modest victory celebration was held at a restaurant in Jack London Square. It was there that Barry announced, &quot;I see no hope for the rest of the teams in the league.&quot;

====Washington Caps (1969–1970)====
Despite their on-court excellence, the Oaks were a disappointment at the gate, partly because of Barry&#x27;s absence in the final five months of the season, partly because they were the only ABA member that competed in the same market as an NBA team, that being the more established Warriors across the bay. They averaged just 2,800 fans per home game at the state-of-the-art Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena, slightly more than the league average. By that time, entertainer-business entrepreneur Pat Boone had become the majority team owner, and after more than $2 million in losses over two seasons, he wanted out of the basketball business. In August 1968, the franchise was sold to a group headed by real estate attorney and former Baltimore Bullets owner Earl Foreman, who immediately moved it to Washington, D.C., even though there was no suitable arena in the vicinity at the time.

Reluctantly, Barry played the 1969–70 season with the ABA&#x27;s Washington Caps. He refused to report to the team at the outset, at one point commenting: &quot;If I wanted to go to Washington, I&#x27;d run for president!&quot; He missed the first 32 games before he joined the team, which played in the Western Division, making for a grueling travel schedule. The Caps still managed to finish with a respectable 44–40 record, good for third place in the Western Division. Appearing in only 52 games because of a knee injury, Barry finished the season with 1,442 points (27.7 per game), second-best in the league. The Denver Rockets edged the Caps, 4–3, in the Western Division semifinals. In Game 7 on the road, Barry went off for 52 points, the most scored in a seventh and deciding game in professional basketball history.

====New York Nets (1970–1972)====
The Washington Caps became the Virginia Squires after the 1969–70 season, but Barry was openly despondent about playing in Virginia. At the same time, he wanted to continue playing in the ABA. Featured on the August 24, 1970, cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in a Squires jersey, he indicated that he would not return to the NBA if the league paid him &quot;a million dollars a year.&quot; He denounced the Squires (and, subsequently, never suited up for them), saying he did not want his kids growing up with a Southern accent. On September 1, 1970, the Squires traded Barry to the New York Nets for a draft pick and $200,000. The negative comments were not the primary reason; rather, Squires owner Earl Foreman was mired in financial troubles and sold Barry to help meet expenses.

After the Squires dealt Barry to the New York Nets, he played in only 59 games in the 1970–71 season because of a knee injury but still made the ABA All Star team. He repeated as an ABA All Star during the 1971–72 season. During the 1970–71 season he led the league in scoring (29.4 points per game) and led the league again in 1971–72 with 31.5 points per game. In both of those years he also led the ABA in free throw percentage as he had in 1968–69. Barry also became the ABA record holder for most consecutive free throws in one game with 23.

In the 1970–71 season, the Nets finished 40–44, good for fourth place in the Eastern Division and a place in the 1971 ABA Playoffs. The Virginia Squires defeated the Nets 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division semifinals. The 1971–72 Nets finished the season at 44–40, making the 1972 ABA Playoffs by claiming third place in the Eastern Division, 24 games behind the 68–16 Kentucky Colonels. In the Eastern Division semifinals the Nets shocked the ABA by defeating the Colonels 4 games to 2. The Nets then eked out a 4–3 game victory over the Virginia Squires in the Eastern Division finals. The Nets were then edged by the Western Division champion Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 2, in the 1972 ABA Finals.

On June 23, 1972, a United States District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction to prohibit Barry from playing for any team other than the Golden State Warriors after his contract with the Nets ended, due to a 5-year contract signed in 1969. On October 6, 1972, the Nets released Barry and he returned to the Warriors.

===Golden State Warriors (1972–1978)===

Upon Barry&#x27;s return to the Warriors and the NBA, Barry moved his game away from the basket, where he arguably became the first so-called point forward in league history. That is, Barry took on a role similar to that of a point guard and became the chief facilitator of the offense. While his offensive forays were not as frequent as in the past, on March 26, 1974, he scored a career-high 64 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a 143–120 win over the visiting Portland Trail Blazers.

In training camp prior to the 1974–75 season, Barry was elected captain by his teammates. The Warriors went on to capture the Pacific Division crown as Barry had the best all-around season of his career. He averaged 30.6 points per game. Barry led the league in free throw percentage (.904) and steals per game (2.9) and ranked sixth in assists per game (6.2), the only forward among the top 10 in the category. In the playoffs, the upstart Warriors turned back the Seattle SuperSonics and Chicago Bulls to capture the Western Conference crown. In the 1975 NBA Finals, the Warriors faced the Washington Bullets, who were led by future Hall of Famers Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld, winning the series in four games. Barry was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player after averaging 29.5 points, 5.0 assists and 3.5 steals per game.

In the 1975 NBA draft, the Warriors selected point guard Gus Williams in the first round. Barry was not required to contribute as much during the 1975–76 season, and his scoring average dipped to 21.0 points per game as a result. Barry&#x27;s relationship with his teammates continued to deteriorate, to the point where during the final game of the 1976 Western Conference Finals, when Suns rookie Ricky Sobers assaulted Barry away from the ball in the first quarter, none of his teammates came to his aid (in response, Barry took very few shots for the rest of the game, leading to speculation that Barry &quot;quit on the team&quot;).

In the 1976–77 season, the Warriors won 46 games with Barry, Phil Smith, and Williams sharing the majority of the scoring and ball-handling responsibilities but were eliminated in the second round by the Los Angeles Lakers. Reportedly, Barry and Williams clashed over the ball-handling role, and Williams was subsequently traded after the season to the Seattle SuperSonics.

Barry averaged 23.1 points per game in his farewell season (1977–78) with the Warriors.

===Houston Rockets (1978–1980)===
Barry finished his career with the Houston Rockets, playing through the 1979–80 NBA season. The Rockets signed him as a free agent in June 1978, and the league awarded veteran guard John Lucas to the Warriors as compensation.

In the twilight of his career, Barry continued to make history. In his Rockets debut, he assumed a new role as the first player off the bench. It was not long before he elevated the point forward position to another level. Barry finished with a career-high 502 assists to become the first true small forward to reach the 500 mark in one season. Until then, swingman John Havlicek had been the only forward with as many as 500 assists in a season, but the Boston Celtics swingman also spent considerable time at the off guard spot. Barry averaged 13.5 points per game and established a new NBA record (since broken) with a .947 free throw percentage.

Barry was less of a factor in his final season. The Rockets were swept by the Celtics in the 1980 Eastern Conference semifinals, and when contract talks with Boston and the Seattle SuperSonics failed to produce a contract, he decided to retire.

==Coaching career==
On October 30, 1992, Barry accepted an offer to become the head coach for the Cedar Rapids Sharpshooters of the Global Basketball Association (GBA). He had led the team to a 12–4 record – the best in the GBA that season – when the league folded in December 1992.

On January 25, 1993, Barry was appointed as head coach for the Fort Wayne Fury of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). He was fired on March 8, 1994, after the Fury had a 12-game losing streak.

Barry coached in the United States Basketball League (USBL) for the New Jersey ShoreCats in 1998 and 1999, and Florida Sea Dragons in 2000.

==Post-playing career==
Barry is part owner and promoter for the Ektio basketball shoe, which doctor and former college basketball player Barry Katz designed to reduce ankle injuries. He also serves on the company&#x27;s board of directors.

Barry finished second in his division at the 2005 World Long Drive Championship.

==Broadcasting career==
Barry was among the first professional basketball players to make a successful transition to the broadcasting profession. He began broadcasting during the 1967–68 season broadcasting Oakland Oaks games because of contractual matters that kept him off the court. Barry continues to work in the field, a career that began with his own radio show in San Francisco and CBS while still an active player and then with TBS.

While working as a CBS analyst during Game 5 of the 1981 NBA Finals, Barry made a controversial comment when CBS displayed an old photo of colleague Bill Russell, who is African-American. He tried to joke that &quot;it looks like some fool over there with that big watermelon grin&quot;. Barry later apologized for the comment, claiming that he did not realize that a reference to watermelons had racial overtones. Russell said that he believed Barry with regard to Barry&#x27;s racial attitudes, but nonetheless, the two men are reported not to have been particularly friendly for other reasons, unrelated to that comment.

CBS did not renew Barry&#x27;s employment for the subsequent season. Producers later cited the general negative tone of his game commentary, which did not sit well with some players and agents around the league. The next season Barry filled in on a few Seattle SuperSonics broadcasts, but a plan for a full-time position fell through when he insisted that his then-wife be allowed to join him when the team was on the road, which would have been contrary to team policy. The next year, Barry was featured in a lengthy &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article written by Tony Kornheiser in which he lamented the failure of his broadcasting career to that point, as well as the fact that he&#x27;d left a reputation within NBA circles for being an unlikeable person. After this, Barry worked with TBS and later on, TNT into the 1989–90 season, mostly as a color analyst but sometimes as a play-by-play announcer paired with Bill Russell. One of the more notable games Barry called as play-by-play announcer on TBS was Game 5 of the 1985 Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers, where Larry Bird made a last-second steal which sealed the win and the Eastern Conference Championship for the Celtics. After the 1989–90 season, Barry became the color analyst for Atlanta Hawks games that aired on TBS, paired with Skip Caray.

In a rare non-sports venture, he hosted the pilot for the mid-1980s game show &quot;Catchphrase&quot;; however, when the series debuted in the fall of 1985, game show veteran Art James replaced him (the series itself was short-lived in the US, but was brought over to the UK and is still running).

In September 2001, Barry began hosting a sports talk show on KNBR in San Francisco until June 2003, when KNBR paired him up with Rod Brooks to co-host a show named &quot;Rick and Rod&quot;. The show aired on KNBR until August 2006, when Barry left the station abruptly for reasons not disclosed to the public.

==Personal life==
Barry is of Irish, English, French, and Lithuanian descent. He is a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He was raised Catholic and later became a Methodist.

As of 2017, Barry resided in Colorado Springs, Colorado with his wife, Lynn Norenberg Barry. While their youngest son, Canyon, played basketball for the University of Florida, they rented a condominium in Gainesville, Florida to watch him play.

He has four sons and a daughter with his first wife Pam: Scooter, Jon, Brent, Drew and Shannon. All of Barry&#x27;s sons were professional basketball players, and he is the only NBA player to have three sons also play in the NBA (Jon, Brent, and Drew). Barry wrote an autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Basketball Gypsy: The Rick Barry Story&quot; with Bill Libby that was published in 1972. With his third wife Lynn he also has a son, Canyon, who is a professional player, playing for Chinese club Hunan Jinjian Miye in the 2018–19 season and later for the United States 3x3 men&#x27;s basketball team.

When his son Brent won the NBA Championship in 2005 with the San Antonio Spurs, Rick and Brent became the second father-son duo to both win NBA Championships as players, following Matt Guokas Sr. and Matt Guokas Jr. Later, this would be repeated by Bill and Luke Walton, Mychal and Klay Thompson, and Gary Payton and Gary Payton II.

Jon and Brent have also moved to broadcasting after retirement. Jon serves as a game analyst on ESPN while Brent worked as a studio and game analyst on TNT and NBA TV until 2018 when he took a job with the San Antonio Spurs to be vice president of basketball operations. Scooter won titles in the CBA and the top Belgian League.

<text>Play-Doh or also known as Play-Dough is a modeling compound for young children to make arts and crafts projects. The product was first manufactured in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, as a wallpaper cleaner in the 1930s. Play-Doh was then reworked and marketed to Cincinnati schools in the mid-1950s. Play-Doh was demonstrated at an educational convention in 1956 and prominent department stores opened retail accounts.

Advertisements promoting Play-Doh on influential children&#x27;s television shows in 1957 furthered the product&#x27;s sales. Since its launch on the toy market in the mid-1950s, Play-Doh has generated a considerable amount of ancillary merchandise such as the Fun Factory.

==History==

===Origin===

The non-toxic, non-staining, reusable modeling compound that came to be known as &quot;Play-Doh&quot; was a pliable, putty-like substance concocted by Noah McVicker of Cincinnati-based soap manufacturer Kutol Products. It was devised at the request of Kroger Grocery, which wanted a product that could clean coal residue from wallpaper.

Following World War II, with the transition from coal-based home heating to natural gas and the resulting decrease in internal soot, and the introduction of washable vinyl-based wallpaper, the market for wallpaper cleaning putty decreased substantially. McVicker&#x27;s nephew, Joe McVicker, joined Kutol with the remit to save the company from bankruptcy. Joe McVicker was the brother-in-law of nursery school teacher Kay Zufall, who had seen a newspaper article about making art projects with the wallpaper cleaning putty. Her students enjoyed it, and she persuaded Noah McVicker (who also sold the putty) and Joe McVicker to manufacture it as a child’s toy. Zufall and her husband came up with the name Play-Doh; Joe McVicker and his uncle Noah had wanted to call it &quot;Rainbow Modeling Compound&quot;.

===Launch===
Joe McVicker took Play-Doh to an educational convention for manufacturers of school supplies, and Woodward &amp; Lothrop, a department store in Washington, DC began selling the compound. In 1956, the McVickers formed the Rainbow Crafts Company to make and sell Play-Doh. Also in 1956, a three-pack of 7-ounce cans was added to the product line, and, after in-store demonstrations, Macy&#x27;s of New York and Marshall Field&#x27;s of Chicago opened retail accounts. In 1957, chemist Dr. Tien Liu reduced Play-Doh&#x27;s salt content (thus allowing models to dry without losing their color), and Play-Doh ads were telecast on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, &quot;Ding Dong School&quot;, and &quot;Romper Room&quot;. In 1958, Play-Doh&#x27;s sales reached nearly $3 million.

===Subsequent developments===
In 1964, Play-Doh was exported to Britain, France, and Italy. By 1965, Rainbow Crafts received a patent for Play-Doh. Also in 1965, the food company General Mills bought Rainbow Crafts for $3 million. In 1967, General Mills bought Kenner Products. In 1971, Rainbow Crafts and Kenner merged, and, in 1987, the Tonka Corporation bought the two. In the 1980s, its cardboard can (with a rust-prone metal bottom) was replaced with a more cost effective plastic container. In 1991, Hasbro became the owner of Play-Doh, putting the compound under its Playskool brand, and continues to manufacture the product today. In 1996, gold and silver were added to Play-Doh&#x27;s palette to celebrate its 40th anniversary.

More than two billion cans of Play-Doh were sold between 1955 and 2005, and, in 2005, Play-Doh was being sold in 75 countries at 95 million cans a year. In the United States, more than 6,000 stores carry Play-Doh.

Play-Doh was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York, in 1998.

In 2003, the Toy Industry Association placed Play-Doh into its &quot;Century of Toys List&quot;, a roll call of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the twentieth century.

In late 2014, the company offered to replace the &quot;Play-Doh Cake Mountain&quot; playset&#x27;s extruder tool, for free, after receiving complaints about the tool&#x27;s &quot;phallic shape&quot;.

===Scent===
To mark Play-Doh&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, Demeter Fragrance Library created a limited-edition fragrance inspired by Play-Doh&#x27;s distinctive odor for &quot;highly-creative people, who seek a whimsical scent reminiscent of their childhood.&quot;

In 2018, Hasbro registered Play-Doh&#x27;s signature scent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It&#x27;s described as a &quot;combination of a sweet, slightly musky, vanilla-like fragrance, with slight overtones of cherry, and the natural smell of a salted, wheat-based dough.&quot;

===Mascots===

Play-Doh packaging was briefly illustrated with children in the mid-1950s, but replaced by the Play-Doh Pixie, an elf mascot which, in 1960, was superseded by Play-Doh Pete, a smock and beret-wearing cartoonish boy. By 1992, Play Doh Pete&#x27;s beret was recolored in blue, and his eyes were given a more human look. Later in 2000, Play-Doh Pete&#x27;s beret was replaced with a baseball cap. Play-Doh Pete later retired and was removed in 2003, lasting for 42 years. Since 2012, the Doh-Dohs are the mascots.

==Ingredients==
Play-Doh&#x27;s current manufacturer, Hasbro, says the compound is primarily a mixture of water, salt, and flour, while its 2004 United States patent indicates it is composed of water, a starch-based binder, a retrogradation inhibitor, salt, lubricant, surfactant, preservative, hardener, humectant, fragrance, and color.

A petroleum additive gives the compound a smooth feel, and borax prevents mold from developing. Play-Doh contains wheat and may cause allergic reactions in people who are allergic to wheat gluten. It is not intended to be eaten.

==Related merchandise==

In 1960, the Play-Doh Fun Factory (a toy press that extrudes the compound in various shapes) was invented by Bob Boggild and Bill Dale. The Play-Doh Fuzzy Pumper Barber &amp; Beauty Shop of 1977 and Mop Top Hair Shop of 1986 featured a figurine whose extruded &quot;hair&quot; could be styled.

In 1995, an educational software CD-ROM game, &quot;Play-Doh Creations&quot; was released.

In 2003, the Play-Doh Creativity Table was sold. Play-Doh related merchandise introduced during the 2007 anniversary year included the Play-Doh Birthday Bucket, the Play-Doh Fifty Colors Pack, the Fuzzy Pumper Crazy Cuts (a reworking of the 1977 Fuzzy Pumper Barber &amp; Beauty Shop), and the Play-Doh Creativity Center. In 2012, &quot;Play-Doh Plus&quot; was introduced. It is lighter, more pliable, and softer than regular Play-Doh.

==Other media==
===Film===
On April 2, 2015, 20th Century Fox announced work on a film adaptation with Hasbro Studios along with its subsidiary company Allspark Pictures and Chernin Entertainment producing, Jason Micallef writing, and Paul Feig directing from his production company Feigco. The film was eventually cancelled and rejected after the acquisition of Fox&#x27;s parent company 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company.

On March 17, 2022, it was announced that a new animated film adaptation is in development at Entertainment One and its parent company Hasbro, Emily V. Gordon writing and Jon M. Chu producing and possibly directing.

===Series===
A game show adaptation started streaming on Amazon Freevee (then known as IMDb TV) initially as a one-off holiday special on December 10, 2021 and later as a full-length series on November 11, 2022. It is hosted by Sarah Hyland.

<text>A pebble is a clast of rock with a particle size of based on the Udden-Wentworth scale of sedimentology. Pebbles are generally considered larger than granules ( in diameter) and smaller than cobbles ( in diameter). A rock made predominantly of pebbles is termed a conglomerate. Pebble tools are among the earliest known man-made artifacts, dating from the Palaeolithic period of human history. 

A beach composed chiefly of surface pebbles is commonly termed a shingle beach. This type of beach has armoring characteristics with respect to wave erosion, as well as ecological niches that provide habitat for animals and plants.

Inshore banks of shingle (large quantities of pebbles) exist in some locations, such as the entrance to the River Ore, England, where the moving banks of shingle give notable navigational challenges.

Pebbles come in various colors and textures and can have streaks, known as veins, of quartz or other minerals. Pebbles are mostly smooth but, dependent on how frequently they come in contact with the sea, they can have marks of contact with other rocks or other pebbles. Pebbles left above the high water mark may have growths of organisms such as lichen on them, signifying the lack of contact with seawater.

== Location ==

Pebbles on Earth exist in two types of locations – on the beaches of various oceans and seas, and inland where ancient seas used to cover the land. Then, when the seas retreated, the rocks became landlocked. Here, they entered lakes and ponds, and form in rivers, travelling into estuaries where the smoothing continues in the sea.

Beach pebbles and river pebbles (also known as river rock) are distinct in their geological formation and appearance.

Manufactured Pebbles-These  are made from natural stones such as marble, granite, and sandstone. Manufactured Pebbles are designed to specified sizes and forms, making them flexible for many purposes.

=== Beach ===

Beach pebbles form gradually over time as the ocean water washes over loose rock particles. The result is a smooth, rounded appearance. The typical size range is from 2 mm to 50 mm. The colors range from translucent white to black, and include shades of yellow, brown, red and green. Some of the more plentiful pebble beaches are along the coast of the Pacific Ocean, beginning in Canada and extending down to the tip of South America in Argentina. Other pebble beaches are in northern Europe (particularly on the beaches of the Norwegian Sea), along the coast of the U.K. and Ireland, on the shores of Australia, and around the islands of Indonesia and Japan.

=== Inland ===

Inland pebbles (river pebbles of river rock) are usually found along the shores of large rivers and lakes. These pebbles form as the flowing water washes over rock particles on the bottom and along the shores of the river. The smoothness and color of river pebbles depends on several factors, such as the composition of the soil of the river banks, the chemical characteristics of the water, and the speed of the current. Because river current is gentler than the ocean waves, river pebbles are usually not as smooth as beach pebbles. The most common colors of river rock are black, grey, green, brown and white.

== Human use ==

Beach pebbles and river pebbles are used for a variety of purposes, both outdoors and indoors. They can be sorted by colour and size, and they can also be polished to improve the texture and colour. Outdoors, beach pebbles are often used for landscaping, construction and as decorative elements. Beach pebbles are often used to cover walkways and driveways, around pools, in and around plant containers, on patios and decks. Beach and river pebbles are also used to create water-smart gardens in areas where water is scarce. Small pebbles are also used to create living spaces and gardens on the rooftops of buildings. Indoors, pebbles can be used as bookends and paperweights. Large pebbles are also used to create &quot;pet rocks&quot; for children.

== Mars ==
On Mars, slabs of pebbly conglomerate rock have been found and have been interpreted by scientists as having formed in an ancient streambed. The gravels, which were discovered by NASA&#x27;s Mars rover Curiosity, range from the size of sand particles to the size of golf balls. Analysis has shown that the pebbles were deposited by a stream that flowed at walking pace and was ankle- to hip-deep.

<doc id="314615" wikidata="Q961786" url="?curid=314615" title="Nate Thurmond">
<text>Nathaniel Thurmond (July 25, 1941 – July 16, 2016) was an American professional basketball player who spent the majority of his 14-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Golden State Warriors franchise. He played the center and power forward positions. Thurmond was a seven-time All-Star and the first player in NBA history to record an official quadruple-double. In 1965, he grabbed 42 rebounds in a game; only Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell recorded more rebounds in an NBA game. Thurmond was named a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985, one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, and part of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

Known to fans as &quot;Nate the Great&quot;, Thurmond has had his No. 42 jersey retired by both the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

== Early life and college ==

Thurmond started at Akron&#x27;s Central High School, where he played alongside fellow future NBA star Gus Johnson. Passing up a scholarship offer from Ohio State to avoid becoming a backup to Jerry Lucas, a high school rival, Thurmond chose to play college basketball at Bowling Green.

Thurmond led the Mid-American Conference in rebounds during all three of his varsity seasons (with a college career average of 17.0 rebounds per game), and was named a first-team All-American by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in 1963. In Thurmond&#x27;s last two years with Bowling Green, he helped lead the team into the NCAA Tournament and he set a school record with 31 rebounds in his final college game.

== Professional career ==
=== San Francisco/Golden State Warriors ===
Thurmond was drafted 3rd overall by the San Francisco Warriors (now known as the Golden State Warriors) in the 1963 NBA draft. As a rookie, he mainly played a supporting role alongside Hall of Fame center Wilt Chamberlain. Thurmond averaged 7 points and 10.4 rebounds in his first NBA season and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team in 1964.

After Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers during the next season, Thurmond blossomed into a highly productive starting center for the Warriors. Among his many accomplishments Thurmond set a regular-season record for rebounds in a quarter with 18, and averaged 21.3 and 22.0 rebounds per game in the 1966–67 and 1967–68 seasons. Thurmond placed second to Chamberlain in the MVP balloting in the 1966–67 season, averaged over 20 points per game each season from 1967–68 through 1971–72, and played in seven NBA All-Star Games as a member of the Warriors.

Thurmond also gained a fearsome defensive reputation in the NBA. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar called Thurmond the toughest defender he ever faced during his 20-season professional career. NBA All-Star center Bob Rule recalled Thurmond blocking six of his seven shots during the first half of their first encounter. After his coach urged him to &quot;Keep putting &#x27;em up. He can&#x27;t block &#x27;em all&quot;, Rule responded &quot;Yeah, well if I hadn&#x27;t made that layup it would have been all of &#x27;em.&quot;

In spite of the contributions of star teammates like Rick Barry and Thurmond&#x27;s stalwart play at center, the Warriors were unable to win a championship. They reached the 1967 NBA Finals, but lost to Chamberlain&#x27;s 76ers.

=== Chicago Bulls ===
A 33-year-old Thurmond was acquired by the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Clifford Ray and $100,000 prior to the 1974–75 season on September 3, 1974. The Bulls had felt a need for one starting center rather than continue with a three-man rotation of Ray, Tom Boerwinkle and Dennis Awtrey. The Warriors added more fiscal stability when completing the deal. On October 18, 1974, against the Atlanta Hawks, in his debut as a Bull, he recorded 22 points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists and 12 blocked shots, becoming the first player in NBA history to officially record a quadruple-double (blocked shots were not counted before ).

=== Cleveland Cavaliers ===
Thirteen games into the 1975–76 season, Thurmond was traded along with Rowland Garrett to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Steve Patterson and Eric Fernsten on November 27, 1975. Thurmond&#x27;s mobility on the court failed to mesh with an offense built for a more stationary center, resulting in diminished playing time on a team enduring a nine-game losing streak at the time of the deal. In Cleveland, the now 35-year-old Thurmond came off the bench for the injured Jim Chones to lead Cleveland&#x27;s &quot;Miracle at Richfield&quot; team to the NBA Eastern Conference finals before the Cavaliers lost to the Boston Celtics in 1976.

A role player reduced to limited minutes and mid-single digit scoring and rebounds, Thurmond retired at the end of the 1976–77 season.

== Personal life ==
After retirement, Thurmond returned to San Francisco and opened a restaurant, Big Nate&#x27;s BBQ. He sold the restaurant after 20 years, while living in San Francisco with his wife, Marci. As of 2019, the Chase Center, home venue for the Golden State Warriors, features a Big Nate&#x27;s BBQ kiosk with dishes that pay homage to his career.

He was given the title &quot;Warriors Legend &amp; Ambassador&quot; by the Warriors organization.

Thurmond died on July 16, 2016, nine days away from his 75th birthday, after a short battle with leukemia. During the 2016–17 season, the Warriors paid homage to Thurmond by patching his number to their jerseys.

<doc id="314616" wikidata="Q800825" url="?curid=314616" title="Glasgow Central railway station">
<text>Glasgow Central (), usually referred to in Scotland as just Central or Central Station, is one of two principal mainline rail terminals in Glasgow, Scotland. The railway station was opened by the Caledonian Railway on 1 August 1879 and is one of 20 managed by Network Rail. It is the northern terminus of the West Coast Main Line ( north of London Euston). As well as being Glasgow&#x27;s principal inter-city terminus for services to England, Central also serves the southern suburbs of the Greater Glasgow conurbation, as well as the Ayrshire and Clyde coasts. The other main station in Glasgow is , which primarily serves regional and intercity services to the north of Glasgow.

With 25 million passengers in 2023–2024, Glasgow Central is the fifteenth-busiest railway station in Britain and the busiest in Scotland, as well as the third busiest station in the UK outside of London, behind and . The station is protected as a category A listed building.

In &quot;Britain&#x27;s 100 Best Railway Stations&quot; by Simon Jenkins, the station was one of only ten to be awarded five stars. In 2017, the station received a customer satisfaction score of 95.2%, the highest in the UK.

==Original station==

The original station, opened on 1 August 1879 on the north bank of the River Clyde, had eight platforms and was linked to Bridge Street station by a railway bridge over Argyle Street and a four-track railway bridge, built by Sir William Arrol, which crossed the Clyde to the south. The station was built over the site of Grahamston village, whose central street (Alston Street) was demolished to make way for the station platform.

The station was soon congested. In 1890, a temporary solution of widening the bridge over Argyle Street and inserting a ninth platform on Argyle Street bridge was completed. It was also initially intended to increase Bridge Street station to eight through lines and to increase Central station to 13 platforms.

==Low-level station==
Originally built as a separate station, there were two island platforms making four platform faces, and a siding to the north. The station was built to serve the underground Glasgow Central Railway, authorised on 10 August 1888 and opened on 10 August 1896. The Glasgow Central Railway was taken over by the Caledonian Railway in 1890. Services ran from and from the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway in the west through to and via Tollcross through to , Newton, and other Caledonian Railway destinations to the east of Glasgow. Other stations include Cambuslang and Motherwell.

==1901–1905 station rebuild==
By 1900 the station was again found to be too small, passenger numbers per annum on the high-level station having increased by 5.156 million since the first extension was completed in 1890. Passenger usage per annum in 1899 was 16.841 million on the high-level station and 6.416 million on the low-level station, a total of 23.257 million. The station is on two levels: the High-Level station at the same level as Gordon Street, which bridges over Argyle Street, and the underground Low-Level station.

Between 1901 and 1905 the original station was rebuilt. The station was extended over the top of Argyle Street, and thirteen platforms were built. An additional eight-track bridge, the Caledonian Railway Bridge, was built over the Clyde, and the original bridge was raised by 30 inches (0.75 m). Bridge Street station was then closed.

Also during the 1901–1905 rebuild, a series of sidings was created at the end of Platforms 11 and 12 on the bridge over the River Clyde. These were named West Bank Siding, Mid Bank Siding and East Bank Siding. A dock siding, No. 14 Dock, was created at the south end of Platform 13.

Central Station has a spacious concourse containing shops, catering outlets, ticket offices and a travel centre. It is fronted by the Central Hotel on Gordon Street, designed by Robert Rowand Anderson. The station building also houses a long line of shops and bars down the Union Street side. The undercroft of the station is not open to the general public, except through regular official tours, and houses private car-parking and utility functions for the station and the adjoining Central Hotel.

The station&#x27;s famous architectural features are the large glass-walled bridge that takes the station building over Argyle Street, nicknamed the &#x27;Hielanman&#x27;s Umbrella&#x27; (Highlandman&#x27;s Umbrella) because it was used as a meeting place for highlanders living in the city; and the former ticket office and information building. This was a large oval building, with the booking office on the ground floor and the train information display for passengers on large printed cloth destination boards placed behind large windows on the first floor by a team of two men. Underneath the &quot;Umbrella&quot; are a number of shops and bars. The Arches, a one-time nightclub, theatre, gallery and restaurant complex, was also located below the station.

==Central Hotel==
Central Station is fronted by the Central Hotel on Gordon Street. Adjoining onto the station concourse, it was one of Glasgow&#x27;s most prestigious hotels in its heyday.

It was originally designed by Robert Rowand Anderson, in &#x27;Queen Anne style&#x27;; he also furnished the public rooms. The hotel was completed in 1883, but was extended along with the station in 1901–1906. The hotel extension was designed by James Miller and it opened on 15 April 1907.

The world&#x27;s first long-distance television pictures were transmitted to the Central Hotel in the station, on 24 May 1927 by John Logie Baird. The hotel was sold by British Rail in the 1980s, and passed through the hands of various private operators until its most recent owner, the Real Hotel Group, went into administration in February 2009, and the hotel subsequently closed amid concerns of asbestos contamination and structural deterioration.

In June 2009, a new company acquired the hotel building, and worked to refurbish and rebrand it as the Glasgow Grand Central Hotel. The refurbished hotel re-opened in September 2010. In 2021 it was refurbished by IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts and rebranded voco Grand Central Hotel.

==Signalling==

The original 1889 signal box was replaced with an electro-pneumatic power-operated box based on the Westinghouse system. Work started in October 1907 and it opened on 5 April 1908. It was built directly over the River Clyde, sitting between the two river bridges, above the level of the tracks. Inside was a frame of 374 miniature levers, making it the longest power frame ever built in Great Britain.

Glasgow Central Signalling Centre, located in the &quot;vee&quot; of Bridge Street Junction, opened on 2 January 1961. It replaced signal boxes at Central Station, Bridge Street Junction, Eglinton Street Junction and Eglinton Street Station. When initially opened it was capable of handling 1,000 routes.

The new signalling centre was needed for three reasons:

* The 1907 power signal box was worn out;
* The original 1879 bridge over the River Clyde was coming to the end of its useful life, and it was more effective to use the newer (1904) bridge to handle all the traffic, with the lines signalled bi-directionally;
* Electrification of the Cathcart Circle Lines, and subsequently the Gourock and Wemyss Bay services and the West Coast Main Line.

In addition to the removal of the east river bridge, the scissor crossovers through the station, the Cathcart Engine siding, East Bank Siding, Mid Bank Siding and No. 14 Dock were removed. The West Bank Siding was numbered as Platform 11a.

Glasgow Central Signalling Centre closed on 27 December 2008, when its area of control was transferred to the new West of Scotland Signalling Centre (WSSC) at Cowlairs. The NX panel is to be preserved. The station is currently signalled by two Westinghouse Westlock Interlockings which are controlled via an Alstom MCS control system.

==Railway electrification==

Overhead power lines began to appear on the high-level platforms in the early 1960s under British Railways. Firstly came 6.25 kV AC overhead power lines from the Cathcart Circle Line electrification scheme, which started on 29 May 1962. During this period, the old 1879 bridge over the River Clyde was removed and the railway lines were rearranged.

This was followed by the 25 kV AC overhead-power-lines electrification of the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway and the Inverclyde Line to Gourock and Wemyss Bay, completed in 1967. The WCML northern electrification scheme started on 6 May 1974. Part of the Cathcart Circle was upgraded to 25 kV AC supply in 1974, to provide a diversionary route; the whole of the Cathcart Circle route was later upgraded to that supply.

Plans to electrify other routes, such as the Whifflet Line, as part of a scheme to improve rail services in Scotland, were completed in November 2014.

==Late-20th century developments==

=== Low-level station ===
====Closure====
Services through the Low-Level station, initially generous, had been greatly reduced due to competition with the extensive and efficient Glasgow Corporation tram system well before the withdrawal of service at the Low-Level station on 3 October 1964 under the &quot;Beeching Axe&quot;. The trams themselves had been replaced by buses by 1962.

====Re-opening====
In 1979, part of the low-level line was electrified and the Low-Level station was re-opened as the Argyle Line of the Glasgow suburban railway network. It consisted of the southern island platform with the original northern island platform and siding remaining closed. Changes to the original track layout had to be made to allow the southern island platform to serve eastbound and westbound trains as the platform was previously only served by westbound trains. The reopened island platform was numbered as Platforms 14 and 15 (later renumbered to 16 and 17 respectively when the project to re-signal and add two additional platforms to the higher level took place in 2008).

Initially services were provided by Class 303 and Class 314 units. The latter were built specifically for this service. Following the withdrawal of the Class 303 units, the service was provided by Class 318 and Class 334 &quot;Juniper&quot; units.

Class 320 units were intended to be used on the route, but due to the position of the original driver&#x27;s monitors for checking doors, this proved impossible. Therefore, these units were restricted to the North Clyde Line. This changed in 2011 with a programme of works carried out to enable the Class 320 units to work through the station in passenger service. The class 320 and 318 units between them now provide the majority of Argyle Line services, with most 334s having moved to operate the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link.

====Flooding of the Low-Level line====
Over the Christmas festive period of 1994, on 11 December, torrential rain caused the River Kelvin to burst its banks at the closed Kelvinbridge station, with the water making its way through the disused tunnels to and the Low-Level station, which was completely submerged by the resultant flash flood. It was closed until 24 September 1995 while repairs were made.

In August 2002, torrential rain flooded out the low-level stations from through to for a number of weeks. Most services were routed to the high-level platforms, or to Queen Street station. The 2002 Glasgow floods had a number of other effects, causing a cryptospiridium outbreak in Glasgow&#x27;s water supply.

===1980s redevelopment===
The high-level station&#x27;s facilities were substantially redeveloped in the mid-1980s. The old ticket office / train information building was replaced in 1985 by an all-new Travel Centre adjacent to the Gordon Street entrance. By 1986 a large electro-mechanical destination board at the end of the platforms, with a smaller repeater board at the western side of the concourse, had replaced the former manually operated train-information boards. The old booking office / train information building was retained and redeveloped into shops, eateries and an upstairs bar/restaurant, and the station was re-floored in marble.

During this redevelopment the staffed ticket barriers at Platforms 1 to 8 were removed and the &quot;yellow ticket&quot; automatic barriers were removed from Platforms 9 to 13 (now 15).

===1998–2005 refurbishment===
In 1998, a five-year renovation programme was initiated by Railtrack, which saw the trainshed completely re-roofed and internally refurbished by Bovis Lend Lease – which also included the restoration of Hielanman&#x27;s Umbrella. The 1980s vintage mechanical pixel-style destination boards were later replaced around 2005 with an array of LED-style destination boards. The final improvement, the upgrading of the upstairs restaurant area, was completed in 2005.

== 21st-century developments ==

===Layout===
Platform 1 is at the east end and platform 15 is located at the west end of the station with platforms 16 and 17 being directly underneath the station&#x27;s high level platforms. Platforms 1 and 2 are usually used by longer distance cross-border services operated by Avanti West Coast, TransPennine Express, LNER and CrossCountry while platforms 3 to 6 are used mainly by services to Lanark, Edinburgh, East Kilbride, Barrhead, Kilmarnock, Carlisle, Girvan, and Stranraer. Platforms 7–10 are used by services which operate along the Cathcart Circle and also Neilston and Newton, but other services are known to use them as well, while platforms 11–15 are used mostly by services to Ayr, Largs, Ardrossan, Gourock, Wemyss Bay and Paisley Canal, with platform 11 being used as a relief platform for Avanti West Coast services if platforms 1 or 2 cannot be used.

===2009/10 expansion===

To accommodate the cancelled Glasgow Airport Rail Link plans, the platforms were renumbered. Platform 11a (the previous West Bank Siding, on the bridge over the Clyde) was renumbered 12, whilst 12 &amp; 13 were renumbered 14 &amp; 15 respectively. In September 2009 the former platform-level car park and passenger drop-off area was taken out of use and the platform over the Clyde (recently renumbered 12) was removed. Two new platforms were created between 11 and 14, being brought into use in May 2010. There is no plan to replace indoor parking or passenger drop-off within Central station. The existing multi-storey parking facility on Oswald Street and on-street parking surrounding Central station remain, with passenger drop-off having moved to surrounding streets. During Cyclone Bodil in December 2013, the glass roof of the station was broken by flying debris.

===Barriers===

Automatic ticket barriers were installed at Glasgow Central and three other city-centre stations from 2011 as part of a crackdown on fare-dodging to increase ticket revenue. This follows barriers being erected at Queen Street Station in 2004, ending ScotRail&#x27;s &quot;open stations&quot; policy under which staffed and previous &quot;yellow ticket&quot; automatic barriers had been scrapped during the 1980s to encourage more passengers; tickets were checked on trains instead. ScotRail finalised negotiations with Network Rail over the project in June 2010, with the project completed in February 2012, covering High Level Platforms 3 to 15 and Low Level Platforms 16 and 17. Platforms 1 and 2 were left without barriers, as they are mostly used by long-distance express services with a high proportion of passengers carrying heavy luggage.

=== Station tours ===
Following the success of the Doors Open day event in summer 2013, tours of the station several times each week began in November 2014. These 90-minute tours cover the roof, plus the catacombs, vaults, and a view of disused platforms below the station.

=== Piano garden ===
In December 2017, McLaren&#x27;s Pianos gave a piano to the station on permanent loan, which is available to the public to play. This area is referred to as the &quot;Piano Garden&quot; and is located directly behind the mobility assistance booth.

=== Current developments ===
In November 2023, Network Rail renewed the concourse departure screens, replacing the 2005 style boards. The new ones are similar to the screens at Glasgow Queen Street. The concourse is due to receive minor refurbishment which will be carried out between late 2023 and late 2024. This work will create better retail space, a new multi faith room and a relocated station reception. Low Level Platforms 16 and 17 will be refreshed, similar to the works carried out at Anderston in 2022.

== Station ticket facilities ==
There are three ticket halls. Two are operated by ScotRail (main concourse and Argyle Street entrance) and the third is a travel centre run by Avanti West Coast adjacent to Platform 1 and 2. Avanti West Coast also operate a dedicated customer lounge next to Platform 1 and a First Class lounge.

== Services 2024 ==
As of December 2024, Glasgow Central is served by five train-operating companies. ScotRail uses both the high level and low level platforms, all other operators use only the high level.

A taxi rank is to the north of the station, while buses operate from the adjacent streets. St Enoch and Buchanan Street Subway stations are within a few minutes&#x27; walk.

First Glasgow operates a bus service on behalf of ScotRail to and Buchanan bus station; this bus is numbered 398 and runs every 12 minutes

<doc id="314619" wikidata="Q456766" url="?curid=314619" title="Paul Arizin">
<text>Paul Joseph Arizin (April 9, 1928 – December 12, 2006), nicknamed &quot;&#x27;Pitchin Paul&quot;, was an American basketball player who spent his entire National Basketball Association (NBA) career with the Philadelphia Warriors from 1950 to 1962. He retired with the third highest career point total (16,266) in NBA history, and was named to the NBA&#x27;s 25th, 50th and 75th anniversary teams. He was a high-scoring forward at Villanova University before being drafted by the Warriors of the fledgling NBA.

==Early life==
Paul Joseph Arizin was born on April 9, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to French immigrants. Arizin did not play basketball at La Salle College High School, failing to make the team in his only tryout as a senior. Arizin graduated just a year before another Basketball Hall of Famer, Tom Gola, entered La Salle College High School as a freshman.

==College career==
During his freshman year at Villanova, Arizin played CYO (Catholic Youth Organization) basketball in Philadelphia. Late in that season, Al Severance, then the Villanova varsity basketball coach, attended one of Arizin&#x27;s CYO games. Afterwards, Severance approached Arizin and asked him if he would like to go to Villanova, to which Arizin answered: &quot;I already go to Villanova.&quot;

Arizin made the team in 1947, his sophomore year, and played for three years. In 1950 he was named the collegiate basketball player of the year after leading the nation with 25.3 points per game. During a game on , Arizin scored 85 points against the Naval Air Materials Center roster. Arizin also scored at least 100 points in a game while playing for Villanova, but the game is not recognized by the NCAA because the opponent was a junior college.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Warriors (1950–1962)===
After being selected by the Warriors with their first pick in the 1950 NBA draft, Arizin averaged 17.2 points per game in his rookie season and was named NBA Rookie of the Year — a designation not currently sanctioned by the NBA for the 1950–51 season. He became one of the greatest NBA players of the 1950s, leading the league in scoring during the 1951–52 and 1956–57 seasons and leading in field goal percentage in 1951–52. Arizin sat out the 1952–53 and 1953–54 NBA seasons while serving in the Marines during the Korean War. On March 20, 1954, he appeared in a game for the Berwick Carbuilders of the Eastern Professional Basketball League (EPBL) and scored 32 points.

Arizin became famous for his line-drive jump shots, and teamed with center Neil Johnston to form the best offensive one-two punch in the NBA at the time, leading the Warriors to the 1956 NBA title. He also played with scoring star Joe Fulks early in his career, and with Philadelphia legends Tom Gola and Wilt Chamberlain toward the end of his career in the early 1960s. Arizin chose to retire from the NBA rather than move with the Warriors to San Francisco. At the time of his retirement, no player had retired from the game with a higher scoring average (21.9 points per game) in his final season. This record would stand until Bob Pettit&#x27;s retirement in 1965 following a season in which he averaged 22.5 PPG.

Arizin played in a total of 10 NBA All-Star Games (he was the 1952 NBA All-Star Game MVP) and was named to the All-NBA First-Team in 1952, 1956, and 1957.

===Camden Bullets (1962–1965)===
After retiring from the NBA, Arizin played for three seasons with the Camden Bullets of the Eastern Professional Basketball League (EPBL), who won the 1964 title. Averaging over 20 points per game each season, he was named the EPBL MVP in 1963, was named to the EPBL All-Star First Team in 1963 and 1964 and to the EPBL All-Star Second Team in 1965.

===Legacy===
Arizin was named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, and was selected to the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. In October 2021, Arizin was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Team. He was inducted into the inaugural class of the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. Arizin died in his sleep at age 78 on December 12, 2006, in Springfield, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="314621" wikidata="Q487586" url="?curid=314621" title="Snog (band)">
<text>Snog is a band that was formed by Australian musician David Thrussell, along with fellow art school friends Tim McGrath and Julia Bourke in 1989. The band&#x27;s music is a fusion of many different styles, including industrial, techno, ambient, experimental, funk and country music. The band name is a reference to &quot;kissing and cuddling&quot;.

==History==
Snog&#x27;s first album &quot;Lies Inc.&quot; was released in 1992 and Pieter Bourke, who has since worked with Dead Can Dance and Lisa Gerrard, joined the band soon afterwards. The second album &quot;Dear Valued Customer&quot;, which drew heavily on techno influences, was then released in 1994. Also in 1994, the side projects Soma (Thrussell and Pieter Bourke) and Black Lung.

By 1997, the band was primarily a solo project for Thrussell, who collaborated with guest musicians on recordings. The next album release was &quot;Buy Me... I&#x27;ll Change Your Life&quot; and country western-style guitar was featured, as well as a cover version of Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s &quot;Let the Little Flowers Grow&quot;. &quot;Third Mall from the Sun&quot; followed in 1999 and the album blended the styles of the previous two albums, in addition to new influences. Thrussell described the progression of Snog&#x27;s musical styles in a 1998 interview with &quot;Sonic Boom Magazine&quot;: &quot;In the past Snog has written a lot of dance floor material and while it has been successful, I kind of felt that I needed to write something different. I intentionally try and do something new with every Snog release. I do not want to get caught up in the musical trap of remaking the same album over and over&quot;.

&quot;Third Mall from the Sun&quot; was followed by the remix album &quot;Relax into the Abyss&quot;. In 2003, the album &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Proles&quot; was released and its follow-up &quot;Snog vs. the Faecal Juggernaut of Mass Culture&quot; was released three years later.

Snog continued to release music into the 21st century and the EP &quot;Everything Is Under Control&quot; (consists of remixes and the additional song &quot;The Lament of the Lost Sheep&quot;) was released on iTunes on 25 March 2013. The EP was followed by 23 April 2013 album release &quot;Babes in Consumerland&quot; and both recordings are part of a contract with the Metropolis record label.

A music video for &quot;Everything Is Under Control&quot; was published on the Internet on 19 March 2013. On 20 March 2013 Snog also released a 12&quot; vinyl record with French record label M-Tronic entitled &quot;The Plug-In Drug&quot;; produced as blue-coloured vinyl and limited to 300 copies, the record features three songs from &quot;Babes In Consumerland&quot;, in addition to remixes and unreleased songs.

==Politics==
Thrussell&#x27;s songs frequently contain themes of anti-consumerism, anti-capitalism, individuality and opposition to the idea of Big Brother.

The albums &quot;Third Mall from the Sun&quot; (1999), &quot;Relax into the Abyss&quot; (2000) and &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Proles&quot; (2003), &quot;The Last Days of Rome&quot; (2006) and &quot;City&quot; (2008) featured artwork by Canadian artist Chris Woods, whose paintings lampoon the advertising tactics of major corporations such as McDonald&#x27;s, The Gap and Nike.

Snog supports the copying of its music and depending on the recording label, many releases are designated copyleft (or &quot;copyright-free&quot;), as indicated by a crossed-out &quot;©&quot; symbol that is printed on the album case.

== Reception ==
In a 2008 review of &quot;The Last Days of Rome&quot;, Matthew Rich from &quot;Left Hip Magazine&quot; described Snog as &quot;the greatest band at the moment&quot;.

<text>Garrett Augustus Morgan Sr. (March 4, 1877 – July 27, 1963) was an American inventor, businessman, and community leader. His most notable inventions were a type of three-way traffic light in 1923, and a protective &#x27;smoke hood&#x27; notably used in a 1916 tunnel construction disaster rescue. Morgan also discovered and developed a chemical hair-processing and straightening solution. He created a successful company called &quot;G. A. Morgan Hair Refining Company&quot; based on his hair product inventions and a complete line of hair care products. He was involved in African Americans&#x27; civic and political advancement, especially in and around Cleveland, Ohio.

==Early life and education==
Morgan was born in 1877 in Paris, Kentucky, an almost exclusively African American community. His father was Sydney Morgan, a son and freed slave of Confederate General John H. Morgan of Morgan&#x27;s Raiders. His mother, also a freed slave, was Elizabeth Reed, daughter of Rev. Garrett Reed; she was part Native American. Garrett Morgan was the seventh of eleven children. Morgan received a sixth grade education at Branch Elementary School in Claysville, Kentucky. At age 14, he moved in search of work to Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Career==
Morgan spent most of his teenage years working as a handyman for a Cincinnati landowner. Like many African American children growing up at the turn of the century, he had to quit school at a young age to work full-time. Morgan hired a tutor and continued his studies while working in Cincinnati. In 1895, he moved to Cleveland, where he began repairing sewing machines for a clothing manufacturer. This experience sparked Morgan&#x27;s interest in how things worked, and he built a reputation for fixing them. His first invention, made during this period, was a belt fastener for sewing machines. Morgan also invented a zigzag attachment for sewing machines.

In 1907, Morgan opened a sewing machine shop. In 1908, more conscious of his heritage, he helped start the Cleveland Association of Colored Men. In 1909, he and his second wife, Czech-immigrant Mary Anne Hassek, opened Morgan&#x27;s Cut Rate Ladies Clothing Store. The shop made coats, suits, dresses, and other clothing, and ultimately had 32 employees.

Around 1910, his interest in repairing other people&#x27;s inventions waned, and he became interested in developing some of his own. He received his first patent in 1912. In 1913, he incorporated hair care products into his growing list of patents and launched the G. A. Morgan Hair Refining Company, which sold hair care products, including his patented hair straightening cream, hair coloring, and a hair straightening comb invented by Morgan. 

In 1914, he patented his smoke hood design, also known as a &#x27;breathing device&#x27;. In 1914, he launched the &quot;National Safety Device Company&quot;. The invention earned him the first prize at the Second International Exposition of Safety and Sanitation in New York City.&quot; In 1916, Morgan rescued workers trapped in a water intake tunnel beneath Lake Erie, using the smoke hood to protect his eyes from smoke and featuring a series of air tubes that hung near the ground to draw clean air beneath the rising smoke.

In 1923, Morgan designed a traffic signal after witnessing a horrible crash at an intersection. His manually-operated design included moving arms featuring signals for &quot;go&quot; and &quot;stop&quot;. He eventually sold the rights to General Electric for $40,000.

Later in life he developed glaucoma. By 1943 was functionally blind. He had poor health the rest of his life, but continued to work on his inventions. One of his last was a self-extinguishing cigarette, which used a small plastic pellet filled with water placed just before the filter. He died on July 27, 1963, at age 86. He is buried at the Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

==Products and inventions==
===Hair care products===
Morgan conducted experiments with a liquid that gave sewing machine needles a high polish, that prevented the needle from burning fabric as it sewed. In 1905, Morgan accidentally discovered that the liquid could straighten hair. After he discovered this, he wiped the liquid on a piece of pony fur cloth and it stood straight. He observed that the liquid worked on his neighbor&#x27;s dog and his own hair. 

He made the liquid into a refining cream and launched the &quot;G. A. Morgan Hair Refining Company&quot; to market it. Morgan received great success and added other products including &quot;hair-growing&quot; cream, black hair oil dye, and a curved-tooth comb for hair straightening in 1910.

=== Traffic signal ===
Following the success of his company, Morgan became a well-known citizen in Cleveland and achieved financial success leading to his purchasing of a new automobile. In 1922, he witnessed an accident between a horse-drawn carriage and a car which sparked inspiration to prevent future accidents. Morgan designed a manually-operated traffic signal with moving arms featuring &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go&quot; signs, which could be placed on a post at traffic intersections. The arms could be raised halfway to indicate caution moving forward. A traffic attendant would crank the post to operate the signal and all lanes could be stopped by showing &quot;stop&quot; if needed. In 1923, Morgan patented his traffic signal. He later sold the rights to General Electric for $40,000.

===Smoke hood ===

Garrett Morgan invented a &quot;safety hood smoke protection device&quot; after seeing firefighters struggling to withstand the suffocating smoke they encountered in the line of duty. His device used a moist sponge to filter out smoke and cool the air. It took advantage of the way smoke and fumes tend to rise to higher positions while leaving a layer of more breathable air below, by using an air intake tube that dangled near the floor. 

The hood used a series of tubes to draw clean air of the lowest level the tubes could extend to. Smoke, being hotter than the air around it, rises, and by drawing air from the ground, the Safety Hood provided the user with a way to perform emergency respiration. In 1912, he filed for a patent for the device. In 1914, he founded a company called the National Safety Device Company to market it. He was able to sell his invention around the country, sometimes using the tactic of hiring a white actor, who would take credit rather than revealing himself as its inventor. 

For demonstrations of the device, he sometimes adopted the disguise of &quot;Big Chief Mason,&quot; a purported full-blooded Indian from the Walpole Island Indian Reserve in Canada. He would demonstrate the device by building a noxious fire fueled by tar, sulfur, formaldehyde, and manure inside an enclosed tent. Disguised as &quot;Big Chief Mason,&quot; he would enter the tent full of black smoke, and would remain there for 20 minutes before emerging unharmed.

A successful demonstration occurred in Cleveland, Ohio. A representative of the company, Mr. Mason, entered a poisonous building with Morgan&#x27;s hood on his head and remained in that environment for twenty minutes. The test was satisfactory according to Chief Stickle of the Cleveland Fire Department, who said that the device was much cheaper and simpler than the oxygen mask used during that time. Following the demonstration, Chief Stickle recommended the purchase of several smoke hoods for the fire department.

Mr. Mason continued to make demonstrations in Ravenna, Youngstown, Canton, and other neighboring cities in Ohio where the device was proclaimed a success. Many large cities throughout the United States had Morgan&#x27;s Smoke Hood in their fire departments, hospitals, asylums, and ammonia factories, and were using them satisfactorily. His safety hood device was simple and effective, whereas the other devices in use at the time were generally difficult to put on, excessively complex, unreliable, or ineffective. 

It was patented and awarded a gold medal two years later by the International Association of Fire Chiefs. Morgan&#x27;s safety hood was used to save many lives during the period of its use.

He developed later models that incorporated an airbag, that could hold about 15 minutes of fresh air.

In 1916, his invention became known nationally when he led a rescue that saved several men&#x27;s lives after the July 24, Waterworks Tunnel explosion in Cleveland, Ohio. Before Morgan arrived, two previous rescue attempts had failed. The attempted rescuers had become victims themselves by entering the tunnel and not returning. Morgan was roused in the middle of the night after one of the members of the rescue team who had seen a demonstration of his device sent a messenger to convince him to come and to bring as many of his Safety Hoods as he could. He and his brother Frank, arrived on the scene still wearing their pajamas and bringing four Smoke Hoods with them. 

Most of the rescuers on the scene were initially skeptical of his device, so he and his brother went into the tunnel along with two other volunteers, and pulled out two men from the previous rescue attempts. He emerged carrying a victim on his back, and his brother followed just behind with another. Others joined in after his team succeeded, and rescued several more. His device was also used to retrieve the bodies of the rescuers that did not survive. Morgan personally made four trips into the tunnel during the rescue, and his health was affected for years afterward from the fumes he encountered there. 

Cleveland newspapers and city officials initially ignored Morgan&#x27;s act of heroism as the first to rush into the tunnel for the rescue, and the key role he played as the provider of the equipment that made the rescue possible. It took years for the city to recognize his contributions. The mayor, Harry L. Davis, failed to put Garrett Morgan&#x27;s name on the list of recommended heroes. 

City officials requested that the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission issue medals to several of the men involved in the rescue, but excluded Morgan from their request. Morgan believed that the omission was racially motivated. Morgan&#x27;s suspicions were confirmed by Victor M. Sincere of the Bailey Company in his statement to the Citizens Award Committee. &quot;Your deed should serve to help break down the shafts of prejudice with which you struggle. And is sure to be the beacon of light for those that follow you in the battles of life.&quot; 

In 1917, a group of Cleveland citizens tried to correct for the omission by presenting him with a diamond-studded gold medal. After the heroic rescue Morgan&#x27;s company received more order requests from fire departments all over the country. However, the national news contained photographs of him, and officials a number of southern cities canceled their existing orders when they discovered he was black. Morgan said in his diary, &quot;I had but a little schooling, but I am a graduate from the school of hard knocks and cruel treatment. I have personally saved nine lives.&quot;

He was given a medal from the International Association of Fire Engineers, which made him an honorary member.

==Community leadership==
In 1908, he co-founded the Cleveland Association of Colored Men, which later merged with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Morgan served as its treasurer. He was a member of the NAACP and donated money to historically black colleges and universities.

In 1920, Morgan founded the &quot;Cleveland Call&quot;, a weekly newspaper. In 1938, he participated in its merger with another paper, which created the &quot;Cleveland Call and Post&quot; newspaper. Morgan purchased a farm near Wakeman, Ohio, and upon that land build the Wakeman Country Club, open to Blacks, unlike most country clubs then.

Morgan was a member of the Prince Hall Freemasons, in Excelsior Lodge No. 11 of Cleveland, Ohio. He belonged to Antioch Baptist Church.

In 1931, believing that Cleveland was not properly addressing the needs of its African American citizens, Morgan ran for a seat on the Cleveland City Council as an independent, but was not elected.

==Personal life==
He married Madge Nelson in 1896. They divorced in 1898.

In 1908, he and Czech-immigrant Mary Anne Hassek were married. Together, they had three children: John Pierpont, Garrett Augustus Jr., and Cosmo Hamlin Morgan. Garrett died in Cleveland in 1963. He is buried in Lake View Cemetery.

==Awards and recognitions==
At the Emancipation Centennial Celebration in Chicago, Illinois, in August 1963, one month after his death, Morgan was nationally recognized.

In the Cleveland, Ohio, area, the Garrett A. Morgan Cleveland School of Science and the Garrett A. Morgan Water Treatment Plant are named in his honor. In 2023 the Cleveland Fire Department&#x27;s new fire boat was named in his honor. In Chicago, an elementary school is named in his honor. An elementary school bearing his name opened in the fall of 2016 in Lexington, Kentucky. 

In Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, there is a street named Garrett A. Morgan Boulevard, formerly Summerfield Boulevard until 2002, and the adjacent Metro stop, Morgan Boulevard, bears his name.

Morgan was included in the 2002 book &quot;100 Greatest African Americans&quot; by Molefi Kete Asante.

Morgan is an honorary member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

Morgan&#x27;s invention of the safety hood was featured on the television show &quot;Inventions that Shook the World&quot; and &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; (S08E05).
