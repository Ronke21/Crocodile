<text>John McCarthy (September 4, 1927 – October 24, 2011) was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist. He was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence. He co-authored the document that coined the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (AI), developed the programming language family Lisp, significantly influenced the design of the language ALGOL, popularized time-sharing, and invented garbage collection.

McCarthy spent most of his career at Stanford University. He received many accolades and honors, such as the 1971 Turing Award for his contributions to the topic of AI, the United States National Medal of Science, and the Kyoto Prize.

== Early life and education ==
John McCarthy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 4, 1927, to an Irish immigrant father and a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant mother, John Patrick and Ida (Glatt) McCarthy. The family was obliged to relocate frequently during the Great Depression, until McCarthy&#x27;s father found work as an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Los Angeles, California. His father came from Cromane, a small fishing village in County Kerry, Ireland. His mother died in 1957.

Both parents were active members of the Communist Party during the 1930s, and they encouraged learning and critical thinking. Before he attended high school, McCarthy became interested in science by reading a translation of &quot;100,000 Whys&quot;, a Russian popular science book for children. He was fluent in the Russian language and made friends with Russian scientists during multiple trips to the Soviet Union, but distanced himself after making visits to the Soviet Bloc, which led to him becoming a conservative Republican.

McCarthy graduated from Belmont High School two years early and was accepted into Caltech in 1944.

He showed an early aptitude for mathematics; during his teens, he taught himself college math by studying the textbooks used at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech). As a result, he was able to skip the first two years of math at Caltech. He was suspended from Caltech for failure to attend physical education courses. He then served in the US Army and was readmitted, receiving a Bachelor of Science (BS) in mathematics in 1948.

It was at Caltech that he attended a lecture by John von Neumann that inspired his future endeavors.

McCarthy completed his graduate studies at Caltech before moving to Princeton University, where he received a PhD in mathematics in 1951 with his dissertation &quot;Projection operators and partial differential equations&quot;, under the supervision of Donald C. Spencer.

== Academic career ==
After short-term appointments at Princeton and Stanford University, McCarthy became an assistant professor at Dartmouth in 1955.

A year later, he moved to MIT as a research fellow in the autumn of 1956. By the end of his years at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) he was already affectionately referred to as &quot;Uncle John&quot; by his students.

In 1962, he became a full professor at Stanford, where he remained until his retirement in 2000.

McCarthy championed mathematics such as lambda calculus and invented logics for achieving common sense in artificial intelligence.

== Contributions in computer science ==

John McCarthy is one of the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of artificial intelligence, together with Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert A. Simon. McCarthy, Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude E. Shannon coined the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; in a proposal that they wrote for the famous Dartmouth conference in Summer 1956. This conference started AI as a field. (Minsky later joined McCarthy at MIT in 1959.)

In 1958, he proposed the advice taker, which inspired later work on question-answering and logic programming.

In the late 1950s, McCarthy discovered that primitive recursive functions could be extended to compute with symbolic expressions, producing the Lisp programming language. That functional programming seminal paper also introduced the lambda notation borrowed from the syntax of lambda calculus in which later dialects like Scheme based its semantics. Lisp soon became the programming language of choice for AI applications after its publication in 1960.

In 1958, McCarthy served on an Association for Computing Machinery ad hoc committee on Languages that became part of the committee that designed ALGOL 60. In August 1959 he proposed the use of recursion and conditional expressions, which became part of ALGOL. He then became involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

Around 1959, he invented so-called &quot;garbage collection&quot; methods, a kind of automatic memory management, to solve problems in Lisp.

During his time at MIT, he helped motivate the creation of Project MAC, and while at Stanford University, he helped establish the Stanford AI Laboratory, for many years a friendly rival to Project MAC.

McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the very earliest time-sharing systems (Compatible Time-Sharing System, BBN Time-Sharing System, and Dartmouth Time-Sharing System). His colleague Lester Earnest told the Los Angeles Times:

In 1961, he was perhaps the first to suggest publicly the idea of utility computing, in a speech given to celebrate MIT&#x27;s centennial: that computer time-sharing technology might result in a future in which computing power and even specific applications could be sold through the utility business model (like water or electricity). This idea of a computer or information utility was very popular during the late 1960s, but had faded by the mid-1990s. However, since 2000, the idea has resurfaced in new forms (see application service provider, grid computing, and cloud computing).

In 1966, McCarthy and his team at Stanford wrote a computer program used to play a series of chess games with counterparts in the Soviet Union; McCarthy&#x27;s team lost two games and drew two games (see Kotok-McCarthy).

From 1978 to 1986, McCarthy developed the circumscription method of non-monotonic reasoning.

In 1982, he seems to have originated the idea of the space fountain, a type of tower extending into space and kept vertical by the outward force of a stream of pellets propelled from Earth along a sort of conveyor belt which returns the pellets to Earth. Payloads would ride the conveyor belt upward.

== Other activities ==
McCarthy often commented on world affairs on the Usenet forums. Some of his ideas can be found in his sustainability Web page, which is &quot;aimed at showing that human material progress is desirable and sustainable&quot;. McCarthy was an avid book reader, an optimist, and a staunch supporter of free speech. His best Usenet interaction is visible in rec.arts.books archives. He actively attended San Francisco (SF) Bay Area dinners in Palo Alto of r.a.b. readers, called rab-fests. He went on to defend free speech criticism involving European ethnic jokes at Stanford.

McCarthy saw the importance of mathematics and mathematics education. His Usenet signature block (.sig) for years was, &quot;He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense&quot;; his license plate cover read, similarly, &quot;Do the arithmetic or be doomed to talk nonsense.&quot; He advised 30 PhD graduates.

His 2001 short story &quot;The Robot and the Baby&quot; farcically explored the question of whether robots should have (or simulate having) emotions, and anticipated aspects of Internet culture and social networking that became increasingly prominent during ensuing decades.

==Personal life==
McCarthy was married three times. His second wife was Vera Watson, a programmer and mountaineer who died in 1978 attempting to scale Annapurna I Central as part of an all-women expedition. He later married Carolyn Talcott, a computer scientist at Stanford and later Scientific Research Institute (SRI) International.

McCarthy declared himself an atheist in a speech about artificial intelligence at Stanford Memorial Church. Raised as a Communist, he became a conservative Republican after a visit to Czechoslovakia in 1968 after the Soviet invasion. He died at his home in Stanford on October 24, 2011.

== Philosophy of artificial intelligence ==

In 1979 McCarthy wrote an article entitled &quot;Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines&quot;. In it he wrote, &quot;Machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs, and having beliefs seems to be a characteristic of most machines capable of problem-solving performance.&quot; In 1980 the philosopher John Searle responded with his famous Chinese Room Argument, disagreeing with McCarthy and taking the stance that machines cannot have beliefs simply because they are not conscious. Searle argues that machines lack intentionality. A vast amount of literature has been written in support of one side or the other.

<text>The music of Oregon reflects the diverse array of styles present in the music of the United States, from Native American music to the contemporary genres of rock and roll, country, rhythm and blues, jazz, pop, electronic music, and hip hop. However, throughout most of its history, the state has been relatively isolated from the cultural forces shaping American music. Much of modern popular music traces its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of African American blues and the growth of gospel music in the 1920s. African American musicians borrowed elements of European and Indigenous musics to create new American forms. As Oregon&#x27;s population was more homogeneous and more white than the United States as a whole, the state did not play a significant role in this history.

== History ==
The state&#x27;s main contributions to American popular music began in the 1960s, when The Kingsmen and Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders established Oregon as a minor center of frat rock and garage rock. This led in one direction to the blues rock tradition of the Robert Cray Band and Curtis Salgado, and in another direction to the hardcore punk scene of the early 1980s Pacific Northwest, led by the Wipers in Portland and like-minded bands in Seattle and Vancouver, BC. Over the next twenty years, punk rock evolved into grunge, riot grrrl, alternative rock, and, eventually, indie rock. In the last decade, Oregon has made a unique contribution to American independent music, with a strong indie music scene developing in Portland. The city&#x27;s reputation as a hipster mecca has paralleled the rise of local indie musicians such as The Decemberists (singer Colin Meloy attended the University of Oregon), Gossip, The Dandy Warhols, M. Ward, Logan Lynn, Storm Large, Pink Martini and the late Elliott Smith. Floater is Portland&#x27;s leading example of an indie band. They have remained unsigned to a major label for over 20 years and have managed to be voted the best band of Portland for 2009 in addition to frequently selling out major venues like the Crystal Ballroom and the Aladdin Theater. Other prominent musicians have relocated to Portland, including Modest Mouse (of Seattle), Sleater-Kinney (of Olympia, Washington), The Shins (of Albuquerque, New Mexico), Spoon (of Austin, Texas), former Pavement leader Stephen Malkmus (of Stockton, California), singer songwriter Patterson Hood (of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and Athens, Georgia), and former R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck (of Berkeley, California and Athens, Georgia).

==Portland==
===Pop Music===
From the 1960s to the 1980s, some musical groups from Portland had occasional success on the pop charts. The Kingsmen (singer Jack Ely died in Oregon) were the first to hit the top 10 with their 1960s garage rock classic &quot;Louie Louie&quot; peaking at #2, and Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders gained popularity in Portland after relocating there from Idaho. The Hudson Brothers had several hits, such as &quot;Mr. Kirby&quot; (though originally this came when the group was named &#x27;The New Yorkers&#x27;), &quot;So You Are a Star&quot; and even had their own eponymous TV show during the 1970s. Quarterflash (which started out in the 1970s as a jazz band called &#x27;Seafood Mama&#x27;), were led by the husband/wife duo Marv &amp; Rindy Ross. The band had several hits, including a platinum-selling #3 song &quot;Harden My Heart&quot; in 1981. Nu Shooz, also led by a husband/wife duo (John Smith &amp; Valerie Day), also had several hits, their biggest also going to #3 &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; in 1986.

===Punk rock===
Portland had one of the most vibrant hardcore punk scenes in the early 1980s Pacific Northwest, rivaled only by Seattle and Vancouver. The Wipers and Poison Idea are the best known representatives of the scene, especially The Wipers, a major grunge influence. These bands played at The Met and the Satyricon. Other hardcore bands in the 1980s included Lockjaw, Final Warning, and The Rats. Hole frontwoman Courtney Love spent time in Portland, and was active in the city&#x27;s punk scene at the time.

===Indie music===
In recent years, a number of indie music bands from Portland which have played local venues have won recording contracts with promoters such as Partisan Records and Knitting Factory Records and have been touring nationally. These include Emil Amos of Holy Sons, Sallie Ford and the Sound Outside, Ages and Ages, Dolorean, and others.

=== Dance Music ===
Portland is also home of the world&#x27;s first and only all-Asian American dance rock band, The Slants, another independent act who has been made international headlines, both for their public battle with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as their active involvement in the anime industry.

==Eugene==
Formed in 1984, the Surf Trio was a punk/surf band based in Eugene.

Floater was formed in 1993 and made their start playing garage parties and at the University of Oregon. Now residing in Portland, Floater has released eight studio albums, plus three live albums on indie label Elemental Records. They have also received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammys from NARAS in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for their first album &quot;Sink&quot; and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for their second album &quot;Glyph&quot;.

As for songs about Eugene, two country stars have weighed in. Dolly Parton wrote a song about Eugene in 1972, which was released in the 4-CD box set &quot;Dolly&quot; in 2009, with the refrain, &quot;Eugene, Oregon I&#x27;ll remember you for the rest of my life, I won&#x27;t forget how good you were to me, No and I won&#x27;t be forgettin&#x27; all the kindness that you show To a homesick country girl a long, long way from Tennessee.&quot; In addition, Johnny Cash recorded the song &quot;Lumberjack,&quot; written by Leon Payne, referring to Eugene Saturday nights: &quot;Well you work in the woods from morning to night, You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight, On Saturday night you go to Eugene, And on a Sunday morning your pockets are clean.&quot;

In 2015 Sufjan Stevens released Carrie &amp; Lowell, which includes a song entitled &quot;Eugene&quot;, as well as &quot;All Of Me Wants All of You&quot;, with references to Spencer Butte, a landmark at Eugene&#x27;s southern edge.

<text>The music in Nevada is often associated with the Rat Pack and lounge singers like Wayne Newton playing in Las Vegas, Reno, and Carson City. However, Nevada has launched many other notable artists and bands from a variety of genres.

==Alternative rock==
The Killers formed in Las Vegas in 2001. They are seen as one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century, and the most successful rock act to ever emerge from the state of Nevada, having sold an estimated 28 million albums worldwide. They had a #1 album in 2019, and their 2006 album &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot; was #2 on the Billboard 200. They have achieved worldwide success as a live band, performing in over fifty countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as Madison Square Garden and Wembley Stadium. The Killers&#x27; lead vocalist Brandon Flowers, born in Henderson, Nevada, has additionally released two solo albums (like Flamingo), both of which reached #1 on the UK Albums charts.

== Indie ==
As a result of the downtown Las Vegas restoration that began in 2006, mainly that of the Fremont East district, which spurred the opening of several new bars and clubs, a new music scene began sprouting up in Las Vegas. With the support of local press, independent musical artists such as the bands Black Camaro, The Big Friendly Corporation, Halloween Town, and A Crowd of Small Adventures grew large fan bases quickly in Las Vegas.

The Las Vegas indie music community would soon form its own music festival to parallel that of the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Founded by Thirry Harlin, James Woodbridge, and Jason Aragon, the music festival, known as Neon Reverb, which consisted of both national and local indie acts, experimented with genres such as Hip-Hop and punk rock as well as other culture related segments such as film and visual art that complement the music portion of the festival. The festival has grown to include a radio segment of the same name, founded by Donald Hickey and The Killers bassist, Mark Stoermer that broadcasts from 91.5 KUNV in Las Vegas.

As a result of the continuing revitalization of downtown Las Vegas, a second wave of indie acts have grown prominent in the local music scene. In December 2011, songwriter Zach Ryan premiered his new band Zach Ryan and the Rouge, which has since been renamed Zach Ryan and the Renegades. Other second wave Las Vegas Indie acts include Restless Suns, and Alaska, who both arrived in 2012. In October 2012, Las Vegas based band Bear With Me finished tracking an EP at Chrome Werewolf, a Las Vegas studio opened in 2011 by Black Camaro&#x27;s Brian Garth. The EP marks Bear With Me&#x27;s second release and features the song &quot;I Am a Fiesta.&quot;

==Pop==
Leah Dizon released an album that reached the top ten albums in Japan in 2007 and included two top ten singles on the Oricon Singles Chart.

==Psychedelic==
In December 2012 Trevor and The Joneses self-released &quot;There Was Lightning&quot;, their first LP. The band formed in early 2012, has performed over 150 shows, and has shared the stage with acts such as The Warlocks. The band was the last to record in Brian Garth&#x27;s now defunct studio Chrome Werewolf in downtown Las Vegas.

== Punk rock ==
Las Vegas is home to notable punk and hardcore bands such as Caravels and Stolas.

===Punks in Vegas===
Punksinvegas.com is a website founded by Emily Matview in 2011. The website publishes news, concert photographs and album reviews relating to punk rock, hardcore punk, ska, emo and indie rock with a specific emphasis on bands from or playing in the Las Vegas and Henderson area. The website began as a simple database of punk shows coming to the Las Vegas area and quickly expanded to include original content, most notably a series of acoustic videos called The Stripped Down Sessions. The Stripped Down Session have featured such notable acts as Less Than Jake, The Bouncing Souls and Dead to Me playing acoustic versions of their songs, often debuting songs for the first time through the Sessions. In late 2011 the website released their first music compilation, featuring new, acoustic holiday-themed songs from Forever Came Calling, Last Call and The Sheds. More recently, Punksinvegas.com has begun re-releasing out of print punk and hardcore albums digitally under the Vegas Archive banner.

<text>James Nicholas Gray (1944 – declared dead in absentia 2012) was an American computer scientist who received the Turing Award in 1998 &quot;for seminal contributions to database and transaction processing research and technical leadership in system implementation&quot;.

==Early years and personal life==
Gray was born in San Francisco, the second child of Ann Emma Sanbrailo, a teacher, and James Able Gray, who was in the U.S. Army; the family moved to Rome, Italy, where Gray spent most of the first three years of his life; he learned to speak Italian before English. The family then moved to Virginia, spending about four years there, until Gray&#x27;s parents divorced, after which he returned to San Francisco with his mother. His father, an amateur inventor, patented a design for a ribbon cartridge for typewriters that earned him a substantial royalty stream.

After being turned down for the Air Force Academy he entered the University of California, Berkeley as a freshman in 1961. To help pay for college, he worked as a co-op for General Dynamics, where he learned to use a Monroe calculator. Discouraged by his chemistry grades, he left Berkeley for six months, returning after an experience in industry he later described as &quot;dreadful&quot;. Gray earned his B.S. in engineering mathematics (Math and Statistics) in 1966.

After marrying, Gray moved with his wife Loretta to New Jersey, his wife&#x27;s home state; she worked as a teacher and he worked at Bell Labs on a digital simulation that was to be part of Multics. At Bell, he worked three days a week and spent two days as a Master&#x27;s student at New York University&#x27;s Courant Institute. After a year they traveled for several months before settling again in Berkeley, where Gray entered graduate school with Michael A. Harrison as his advisor. In 1969 he received his Ph.D. in programming languages, then did two years of postdoctoral work for IBM.

While at Berkeley, Gray and Loretta had a daughter; they were later divorced. His second wife was Donna Carnes.

==Research==
Gray pursued his career primarily working as a researcher and software designer at a number of industrial companies, including IBM, Tandem Computers, and DEC. He joined Microsoft in 1995 and was a Technical Fellow for the company until he was lost at sea in 2007.

Gray contributed to several major database and transaction processing systems. IBM&#x27;s System R was the precursor of the SQL relational databases that have become a standard throughout the world. For Microsoft, he worked on TerraServer-USA and Skyserver.

His best-known achievements include:
* ACID, an acronym describing the requirements for reliable transaction processing and its software implementation
*Granular database locking
* Two-tier transaction commit semantics
* The Five-minute rule for allocating storage
* OLAP cube operator for data warehousing
* Characterization of software bug types

He assisted in developing Virtual Earth. He was also one of the co-founders of the Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research.

==Disappearance==

Gray, an experienced sailor, owned a sailboat. On January 28, 2007, he failed to return from a short solo trip to scatter his mother&#x27;s ashes at the Farallon Islands near San Francisco. The weather was clear, and no distress call was received, nor was any signal detected from the boat&#x27;s automatic Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon.

A four-day Coast Guard search using planes, helicopters, and boats found nothing.
On February 1, 2007, the DigitalGlobe satellite scanned the area and the thousands of images were posted to Amazon Mechanical Turk. Students, colleagues, and friends of Gray, and computer scientists around the world formed a &quot;Jim Gray Group&quot; to study these images for clues. On February 16 this search was suspended, and an underwater search using sophisticated equipment ended May 31.

Marine search expert Bob Bilger explains that the type of boat used by Gray, a C&amp;C 40 is vulnerable to hull damage, and can sink as quickly as in 30 seconds, also taking any equipment with it, not leaving any loose debris.

The University of California, Berkeley and Gray&#x27;s family hosted a tribute on May 31, 2008. Five years after the disappearance, Carnes petitioned a court to have her husband declared dead and on January 28, 2012, Gray was declared legally dead.

In 2012, Carnes co-authored a paper on coping with ambiguous loss. In 2014, in conjunction with the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, CNN interviewed Carnes. At the time, she lived with her elderly mother suffering from dementia in Wisconsin.

==Legacy==
Microsoft&#x27;s WorldWide Telescope software was dedicated to Gray. In 2008, Microsoft Research opened Gray Systems Lab, a research center in Madison, Wisconsin, named after Jim Gray.

Database conference SIGMOD confers the Jim Gray Doctoral Dissertation Award annually to doctoral candidates researching databases.

Each year, Microsoft Research presents the Jim Gray eScience Award to a researcher who has made an outstanding contribution to the field of data-intensive computing. Award recipients are selected for their ground-breaking, fundamental contributions to the field of eScience. Previous award winners include Alex Szalay (2007), Carole Goble (2008), Jeff Dozier (2009), Phil Bourne (2010), Mark Abbott (2011), Antony John Williams (2012), and Dr. David Lipman, M.D. (2013).

<doc id="308368" wikidata="Q1616457" url="?curid=308368" title="Mycroft Holmes">
<text>Mycroft Holmes is a fictional character appearing in stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle from 1893 to 1908. The elder brother (by seven years) of detective Sherlock Holmes, he is a government official and a founding member of the Diogenes Club. Mycroft is described as having abilities of deduction and knowledge exceeding even those of his brother, though their practical use is limited by his dislike of fieldwork.

==Fictional character biography==
===History and occupation===
Mycroft Holmes is Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s older brother. He mainly appears in two stories by Doyle, &quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;. He also appears briefly in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, and is mentioned in &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;.

He first appears in &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot;, in which he brings Sherlock a case involving one of his neighbours. Sherlock Holmes tells Dr. Watson that Mycroft has powers of observation and deduction superior to his own, but is not energetic or ambitious, nor does he have the capability to prepare a case for trial. He also comments that some of his most interesting cases have come to him through Mycroft. In the story, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson visit Mycroft at the Diogenes Club, which Mycroft co-founded. Also, Mycroft visits 221B Baker Street.

Mycroft makes a brief appearance in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. Sherlock Holmes gives Dr. Watson instructions to take a certain route to leave London to avoid Moriarty&#x27;s gang, and part of this plan involves a ride in a brougham driven by a cloaked driver. Watson sees the coachman and does not recognise him. Sherlock later tells Watson that the driver was Mycroft. Near the end of the story after Sherlock&#x27;s supposed death, Watson reads a letter left by Sherlock, which includes the statement, &quot;I made every disposition of my property before leaving England, and handed it to my brother Mycroft.&quot;

In &quot;The Empty House&quot;, it is revealed that Sherlock Holmes faked his death in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; and subsequently went abroad. His only confidant during this time was Mycroft, who provided him with the money he needed. When Sherlock returned to London, he found that Mycroft had preserved his Baker Street rooms and his papers &quot;exactly as they had always been&quot;.

In &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;, Mycroft goes to Baker Street to speak with his brother about recovering missing submarine plans for the government. Sherlock Holmes says in this story that Mycroft only visited 221B Baker Street once before. Though Sherlock initially told Watson in &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; that Mycroft audits books for the British government, he reveals to Watson in &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; that Mycroft&#x27;s true role is more substantial:

Mycroft has a unique position in the government, which is not named in the stories. Sherlock comments regarding Mycroft&#x27;s role that there &quot;has never been anything like it before, nor will be again&quot; and that Mycroft &quot;has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man living&quot;. He describes Mycroft&#x27;s position:

He adds to this that Mycroft thinks of nothing other than government policy, except when he asks Mycroft to advise him on one of his cases.

Several Holmesian scholars have proposed theories about Mycroft, though none of these are confirmed in the stories. In &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot;, Dr. Watson records that Sherlock Holmes could assume various disguises in &quot;at least five small refuges&quot; which he had in different parts of London; Vincent Starrett wrote that Mycroft&#x27;s residence &quot;would certainly be one of them&quot;. Ronald A. Knox suggested that Mycroft was a double agent who assisted both Sherlock and Professor Moriarty, with the goal of ultimately betraying Moriarty and members of his gang, including Colonel Moran. June Thomson theorised that Mycroft nominated Sherlock to infiltrate the German spy ring in &quot;His Last Bow&quot; (set in 1914) and might have persuaded Sherlock to come out of retirement. Thomson calculated that Mycroft would have retired himself in 1912 at the age of sixty-five years old, but would have maintained his connections with former colleagues in the government.

===Personality and habits===
Possessing deductive powers exceeding even those of his younger brother, Mycroft is nevertheless unsuitable for performing detective work as he is unwilling to put in the physical effort necessary to bring cases to their conclusions. In &quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot;, Sherlock Holmes says:

Mycroft does not have ambitions of any kind, according to Sherlock. Despite being &quot;the most indispensable man in the country&quot;, as Sherlock says, Mycroft remains a subordinate, will receive &quot;neither honour nor title&quot;, and his relatively modest annual salary in &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; (which takes place in 1895) is £450 ().

He lives in rooms in Pall Mall. His regular routine is to walk around the corner each morning to Whitehall where he works, and in the evening, to walk back to Pall Mall. He then stays at the Diogenes Club, which is located across from his lodgings in Pall Mall, from quarter to five until twenty to eight. He seldom breaks this routine or goes anywhere except these three locations.

Mycroft reads Watson&#x27;s accounts of Sherlock&#x27;s adventures and takes an interest in Sherlock&#x27;s cases. In &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot;, he takes snuff from a tortoise-shell box while at the Diogenes Club, and brushes the grains from his coat with a large, red silk handkerchief. He is also seen &quot;sitting smoking in the armchair&quot; at Baker Street. Mycroft is occasionally referred to by Sherlock Holmes as &quot;Brother Mycroft&quot; in &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;. He is the only character to refer to Sherlock exclusively by his first name.

===Appearance and age===
Mycroft resembles his brother Sherlock Holmes, but is described in &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; as being &quot;a much larger and stouter man&quot;. According to Watson, Mycroft&#x27;s eyes are &quot;a peculiarly light, watery grey&quot; and always have &quot;that far-away, introspective look&quot; which Watson had only seen in Sherlock&#x27;s when he exerted his full powers (Sherlock also has grey eyes.) In &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, Sherlock informs Watson that the driver of the brougham (later revealed to be Mycroft) will wear &quot;a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red&quot;. When Watson sees the coachman, he describes him as &quot;a very massive driver wrapped in a dark cloak&quot;. In &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;, Watson states that Mycroft is &quot;tall and portly&quot;, and gives the following description of him:

Mycroft is seven years older than Sherlock. According to Leslie S. Klinger, Mycroft was born in 1847. A reference in the short story &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, which takes place in 1914, suggests that Sherlock is sixty years old at the time. This would make the year of Sherlock&#x27;s birth approximately 1854, and thus Mycroft&#x27;s approximately 1847.

==Adaptations==

Mycroft Holmes has been portrayed many times in adaptations of the Holmes stories in film, television, radio, and other media.

===Radio===
* Episodes adapted from the stories in which Mycroft appears, &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; and &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot;, both aired in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1931, and in &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1939 and 1940 respectively, as well as both in 1943 in the same series. No cast listing currently exists to show who portrayed Mycroft in these episodes. Rex Evans played Mycroft in at least two episodes of &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which were broadcast in 1945 and 1946 respectively, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson.
* In the 1950s radio series starring John Gielgud as Sherlock Holmes, Gielgud&#x27;s own brother, Val Gielgud, played the part in &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;.
* In the BBC radio dramatisations with Carleton Hobbs and Norman Shelley, Mycroft was played at various times by Malcolm Graeme, Keith Williams, Felix Felton, and, in &quot;The Empty House&quot;, by Carleton Hobbs himself.
* In the BBC Radio adaptations starring Clive Merrison as Sherlock and Michael Williams as Watson, John Hartley played Mycroft in &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; on 21 October 1992, &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; on 24 January 1994, and &quot;The Retired Colourman&quot; on 29 March 1995. Mycroft, voiced by James Laurenson, also appears in a two-part episode of the BBC radio series &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, again with Clive Merrison as Sherlock Holmes.
* Mycroft is a recurring character in the American radio series &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

===Film===
* The first film appearance of Mycroft Holmes was in the 1922 short film &quot;The Bruce Partington Plans&quot; in the Stoll film series, where he was played by Lewis Gilbert.
* In the 1965 film &quot;A Study in Terror&quot;, Mycroft is played by Robert Morley.
* In the Billy Wilder-directed film &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970), Mycroft was played by Christopher Lee. 
* The 1975 film &quot;The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes&#x27; Smarter Brother&quot;, starring Gene Wilder as Holmes&#x27;s &quot;younger&quot; brother &quot;Sigerson Holmes,&quot; was inspired by Mycroft, who is mentioned, but does not appear except in a photograph of the three brothers as children.
* Charles Gray assumed the character in both the 1976 film &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; and Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series.
* Peter Jeffrey played Mycroft in the 1990 film &quot;Hands of a Murderer&#x27;.
* Stephen Fry played Mycroft in the Guy Ritchie-directed &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, released in December 2011.
* Hugh Laurie played Mycroft in the Will Ferrell comedy movie &quot;Holmes &amp; Watson&quot;, released in 2018
* Sam Claflin played Mycroft in the movie &quot;Enola Holmes&quot;, released in September 2022.

===Television===
* The BBC broadcast two &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series in 1965 and 1968 which starred Douglas Wilmer (1965) and Peter Cushing (1968) as Sherlock and Nigel Stock as Watson. Mycroft appeared twice, once in 1965 in &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; and played by Derek Francis and in 1968 in &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; and played by Ronald Adam.
* Boris Klyuyev played Mycroft Holmes in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot;, a Soviet television film series. Klyuyev was nine years younger than Vasily Livanov, who played Sherlock Holmes. According to Sherlock, Mycroft is married and has a son.
*Charles Gray, who played Mycroft in the film &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, also played the character in four episodes of Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Gray&#x27;s first two television appearances were adaptations of the two stories in which Mycroft actually appears (&quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; and &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;). In the two other appearances, the character was used to replace another for various reasons. In &quot;The Golden Pince-Nez&quot;, Mycroft was used in place of Watson, since Edward Hardwicke was unavailable due to a prior commitment to appear in &quot;Shadowlands&quot;. In &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot;, Mycroft was used in place of Sherlock owing to Jeremy Brett&#x27;s ill health.
* A direct female descendant named Mycroft Holmes is introduced in the &quot;BraveStarr&quot; episode &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 23rd Century&quot; as an agent of Scotland Yard and an ally of her ancestor.
* Jerome Willis played Mycroft in &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady&quot;, a 1991 made-for-TV film which starred Christopher Lee as Holmes and Patrick Macnee as Watson.
* R. H. Thomson played Mycroft in the 2001 made-for-TV film &quot;The Royal Scandal&quot; opposite Matt Frewer&#x27;s Sherlock.
* Richard E. Grant played Mycroft in &quot;&quot; (2002). In the television film, Mycroft was injected with an unidentified substance by Moriarty many years before the film takes place, which left Mycroft disabled and dependent on leg braces and walking sticks. It is not explained further in the film why or how this occurred.
* In the 2010 BBC television series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, Mycroft is portrayed by series co-creator Mark Gatiss. In this contemporary version, Sherlock and Mycroft exhibit smouldering animosity towards each other (which Dr. Watson characterises as &quot;sibling rivalry&quot; and Mycroft himself refers to as a &quot;childish feud&quot;). Mycroft is part of the Cabinet Office and is so powerful that he can use mass surveillance to track Sherlock. In keeping with the books, Mycroft describes himself as &quot;occupying a small position in the British government&quot;, but more accurately, &quot;he &quot;is&quot; the British government&quot;. While Sherlock goes so far as to suggest that they would both be willing to arrange the death of the other, Mycroft gradually reveals a well-hidden deep familial love for his brother, something Sherlock, in time, begins to reciprocate. In the 2015 Christmas Special &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot;, he is portrayed by Gatiss in heavy makeup as morbidly obese, more in keeping with the original stories.
*Rhys Ifans played Mycroft Holmes in another modern adaptation, &quot;Elementary&quot;. In this series, Mycroft is introduced as a London restaurateur who later turns out to work for MI6 as a source due to his restaurants being used as a front for various crime organisations. Mycroft goes into hiding at the end of the second season when he exposed his ties to MI6 to help Sherlock with a case, which Holmes feels reflected a lack of trust in him to find another solution. In the sixth-season episode &quot;Nobody Lives Forever&quot;, it is revealed that Mycroft died ten months prior to the events of that episode of a brain haemorrhage, which Sherlock was never informed about until he started digging.

===Novels and short stories===
The character has been used many times in works that are not adaptations of Holmes stories:

* American former basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anna Waterhouse authored &quot;Mycroft Holmes&quot;, released September 2015, as well as two sequels entitled &quot;Mycroft and Sherlock&quot; released in 2018 and &quot;Mycroft and Sherlock: The Empty Birdcage&quot; released in 2019.

<text>The Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) is a medium-sized shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. The scientific name of this species records a name shift: Manx shearwaters were called Manks puffins in the 17th century. Puffin is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English &quot;pophyn&quot;) for the cured carcasses of nestling shearwaters. The Atlantic puffin acquired the name much later, possibly because of its similar nesting habits.

==Taxonomy==
The shearwaters form part of the family Procellariidae, a widespread group containing nearly 100 species of medium to large seabirds. They have long, narrow wings and the characteristic “tube nose”. Although it was considered a monotypic species, recently an endemic subspecies for the Canary Islands has been proposed &quot;P. puffinus canariensis&quot;. The large genus &quot;Puffinus&quot; includes several species formerly considered to be subspecies of the Manx shearwater, including the yelkouan shearwater, Balearic shearwater, Hutton&#x27;s shearwater, black-vented shearwater, fluttering shearwater, Townsend&#x27;s shearwater and the Hawaiian shearwater. Of these, the Hawaiian and possibly Townsend&#x27;s shearwaters seem to be most closely related to the Manx shearwater.

Three extinct species appear to be closely related to the Manx shearwater, the lava shearwater, the dune shearwater and Scarlett&#x27;s shearwater. DNA recovered from the lava shearwater of the Canary Islands suggests that it is the Manx shearwater&#x27;s sister species despite being significantly smaller.

The Manx shearwater was first described by Danish zoologist Morten Thrane Brünnich as &quot;Procellaria puffinus&quot; in 1764. The current scientific name &quot;Puffinus&quot; derives from &quot;puffin&quot; and its variants, such as poffin, pophyn, and puffing, which referred to the cured carcass of the fat nestling of the shearwater, a former delicacy. The original usage dates from at least 1337, but from as early as 1678, the term gradually came to be used for another seabird, the Atlantic puffin. The current English name was first recorded in 1835 and refers to the nesting of this species on the Calf of Man.

==Description==
The Manx shearwater is with a wingspan and weighs . It has the typically &quot;shearing&quot; flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wings held at right angles to the body, and it changes from black to white as the black upper parts and white under sides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.

===Voice===
This shearwater is mainly silent at sea, even when birds are gathered off the breeding colonies. It calls on its nocturnal visits to the nesting burrows in flight, on the ground, and in the burrows, although moonlight depresses the amount of calling. The vocalisations largely consists of a raucous series of croons, howls, and screams, typically in groups of a few syllables, which become weaker and throatier. The male has some clear ringing and shrieking tones absent from the harsher repertoire of the female, the difference being obvious when a pair duets.

The nocturnal vocalisations of Manx shearwater are notorious for their eerie character and the alarm they might arouse in uninitiated hearers. Anecdotally: &quot;the diabolical shrieks and cackles of this species have earned it, in various parts of the world and various languages, the local nickname &#x27;Devil Bird.

Females can recognise the voice of their mates, but not of their young. They do not provide postnesting care, and a chick in their burrow is likely their own, so voice identification is not needed.

===Vision===

The vision of the Manx shearwater has a number of adaptations to its way of life. Like other tube-nosed seabirds, it has a long, narrow area of visual sensitivity containing the fovea across the retina of the eye. This region is characterised by the presence of ganglion cells that are regularly arrayed and larger than those found in the rest of the retina. This feature helps in the detection of items in a small area projecting below and around the bill. It may assist in the detection of prey near the sea surface as a bird flies low over it.

Since it visits its breeding colony at night, a shearwater has adaptations for nocturnal vision, too. In the shearwater&#x27;s eyes, the lens does most of the bending of light necessary to produce a focused image on the retina. The cornea, the outer covering of the eye, is relatively flat, so of low refractive power. In a diurnal bird like a pigeon, the reverse is true; the cornea is highly curved and is the principal refractive component. The ratio of refraction by the lens to that by the cornea is 1.6 for the shearwater and 0.4 for the pigeon. The shorter focal length of shearwater eyes give them a smaller, but brighter, image than is the case for pigeons. Although the Manx shearwater has adaptations for night vision, the effect is small, and these birds likely also use smell and hearing to locate their nests.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Manx shearwater is entirely marine, typically flying within of the sea surface. It nests in burrows on small islands, which it visits only at night. Its nesting colonies are in the north Atlantic Ocean in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, France, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, the Azores, Canary Islands, and Madeira. The most important colonies, with a total of more than 300,000 pairs, are on islands off Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Three-quarters of the British and Irish birds breed on just three islands; Skomer, Skokholm, and Rùm. Around 7000–9000 pairs breed in Iceland, with at least 15,000 pairs on the Faeroes. Other populations are of at most a few hundred pairs. The northeast of North America has recently been colonised from Newfoundland and Labrador to Massachusetts; although breeding was first recorded in 1973, populations remain small. Records in the northeast Pacific are increasing, and breeding has been suspected in British Columbia and Alaska.

During the breeding-season birds regularly commute between their colonies and offshore feeding grounds that can be up to 1,500 km away. For example, adult Manx shearwaters rearing their chick on the west coast of Ireland have been observed to travel all the way to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to feed when the conditions are right.

The breeding colonies are deserted from July to March, when the birds migrate to the South Atlantic, wintering mainly off Brazil and Argentina, with smaller numbers off southwest South Africa.
Juvenile birds undertake their first migration without their parents. Only a few days after leaving the nest, these birds can already travel up to 2000 km. The journey south can be over , so a 50-year-old bird has probably covered over a million km (600,000 mi) on migration alone. The migration also appears to be quite complex, containing many stopovers and foraging zones throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Ornithologist Chris Mead estimated that a bird ringed in 1957 when aged about 5 years and still breeding on Bardsey Island off Wales in April 2002 had flown over 8 million km (5 million mi) in total during its 50-year life.

Manx shearwaters are able to fly directly back to their burrows when released hundreds of kilometres away, even inland. 
==Behaviour==
Manx shearwaters are long-lived birds. A Manx shearwater breeding on Copeland Island, Northern Ireland, was as of 2003/04, the oldest known living wild bird in the world: ringed as an adult (at least 5 years old) in July 1953, it was retrapped in July 2003, at least 55 years old.

This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially on migration in autumn. It is silent at sea, but at night, the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls.

===Breeding===

Although shearwaters return to the breeding colonies from March onwards, the females often then leave again for 2–3 weeks before egg-laying in early May. Males return to the colonies in which they were hatched, but up to half of females may move elsewhere. The nest is a burrow, often previously excavated by a European rabbit, although shearwaters can dig their own holes. Suitable holes under rocks may also be used. The burrows may be reused in subsequent years.

The single white egg averages and weighs , of which 7% is shell.

===Food and feeding===
The Manx shearwater feeds on small fish (herrings, sprats, and sand eels), crustaceans, cephalopods, and surface offal. The bird catches food off the surface or by pursuit diving, and forages alone or in small flocks. It can be attracted by feeding cetaceans, but rarely follows boats or associates with other shearwater species.

Tube-nosed seabirds can detect food items at a distance of several tens of kilometres using their sense of smell to detect offal and compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide produced when phytoplankton is consumed by krill. They track across the wind until they find a scent and then follow it upwind to its origin.
=== Rafting ===
Manx shearwaters engage in a behaviour termed &quot;rafting&quot;, where birds sit, often in large groups of more than 10,000, on the water adjacent to their Skomer Island breeding colony before and after visiting their chicks. Rafts move closer to the island during the night and further away in the morning which produces a &quot;halo&quot; effect - where no birds are found close to the island during daylight. These day-night cycles of rafting distributions are prominent for Manx shearwaters around Skomer Island and might provide a way of waiting for dusk that reduces predation risk.

==Predators and parasites==

Because of their lack of mobility on land, Manx shearwaters are vulnerable to attack by large gulls, such as the great black-backed gull, and great skua. Birds of prey such as the peregrine falcon and golden eagle are also recorded as killing adult birds.

Rats and cats are a serious problem where they are present; the large shearwater colony on the Calf of Man was destroyed by rats that arrived from a shipwreck in the late 18th century. European hedgehogs eat the eggs of nesting seabirds where they have been introduced. Red deer have been recorded killing and eating young shearwaters on at least Foula, Skokholm, and Rùm; on the latter island, 4% of the chicks are killed by deer, and sheep have also been involved. The reason for the carnivorous behaviour is thought to be a need for extra calcium.

Manx shearwaters frequently carry feather lice (Mallophaga) most of which are either the feather-eaters in the groups Ischnocera, or Amblycera, which also consume blood. The most common are the ischnocerans &quot;Halipeurus diversus&quot; and &quot;Trabeculus aviator&quot;. The nests of breeding birds frequently contain the shearwater flea; &quot;Ornithopsylla laetitiae&quot; is also commonly present, which shares a common ancestry with North American rabbit fleas. Where their burrows are near those of Atlantic puffins, the tick &quot;Ixodes uriae&quot; is common. The mite &quot;Neotrombicula autumnalis&quot; is often present, and has been implicated in spreading puffinosis. Puffinosis is a viral disease of in which young birds get blisters on their feet, conjunctivitis, and problems with movement. The death rate can reach 70% in infected birds. Internal parasites include the tapeworm &quot;Tetrabothrius cylindricus&quot;.

== Status ==
The European population of the Manx shearwater has been estimated at 350,000–390,000 breeding pairs or 1,050,000–1,700,000 individual birds, and makes up 95% of the world total numbers. Although this species&#x27; population now appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this shearwater is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.

In the north of its range, numbers are stable and the range is expanding, but human activities are affecting populations in the Macaronesian islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. These include birds stranded when dazzled by artificial lighting. As with other shearwaters and petrels, newly fledged Manx shearwaters are susceptible to grounding in built-up areas due to artificial light. The moon cycle and strong onshore winds largely influence grounding events in west Scotland, and visibility conditions to a lesser extent. Around 1000–5000 chicks a year are legally taken for food in the Faroes. Introduced mammals are a problem, although populations can recover when rats and cats are removed from islands. Rabbits may try to occupy burrows, but also dig new tunnels.

==In culture==

The large chicks of the Manx shearwater are very rich in oil from their fish diet and have been eaten since prehistoric times. They are easily extricated from their burrows, and the annual crop from the Calf of Man may have been as high as 10,000 birds per year in the 17th century. The young birds were also eaten in Ireland, Scotland, and the Scottish islands.

The eerie, nocturnal cries of nesting shearwaters and petrels has led to associations with the supernatural. The breeding colonies at Trollaval on Rùm and Trøllanes and Trøllhøvdi in the Faroe Islands are believed to have acquired their troll associations from the night-time clamour.

Other Phoenix bands include the Meat Puppets, American Standards, Gin Blossoms (lead guitarist Doug Hopkins died in &#x27;93 in Tempe), Phunk Junkeez, Chronic Future, Dead Hot Workshop, The Jetzons, and Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers.

In the 1960s, rock and R&amp;B bands inspired by British Invasion groups like The Beatles appeared in Phoenix. Musicians to emerge from this era include Alice Cooper, and Bill Spooner of The Tubes. The group Pages was formed by Phoenix residents Richard Page and Steve George, who later formed the nucleus of the Phoenix pop-rock group Mr. Mister (who had 2 #1 Hot 100 hits, including &quot;Broken Wings&quot; in 1985).

Dolan Ellis has lived in Phoenix most of his adult life. He moved to LA in the early 1960s, where he was an original member of the Grammy-winning folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Dolan returned to Phoenix while the group was still at its peak. In February 1966, Governor Sam Goddard appointed Dolan as Arizona&#x27;s Official State Balladeer, which was renewed under ten consecutive governors. He was selected as the first Arizona Culture Keeper, and Senator John McCain read his accomplishments into the U.S. Congressional Record. Dolan spent a few years away from Phoenix from about 1993 through 2003, to found the Arizona Folklore Preserve in Ramsey Canyon. He still commutes to the AFP, where he continues to serve as Artist in Residence, about twice a month.

In the early 1980s, Phoenix hardcore punk bands included The Feederz, JFA (Jodie Foster&#x27;s Army) and Meat Puppets, the latter of which had country influences and became a major influence on grunge. Other rock bands of the time included Flotsam and Jetsam, Sun City Girls, Sacred Reich, Caterwaul, and Mighty Sphincter.

During the 1990s, Chester Bennington (d.2017), lead singer for Linkin Park, spent several years in Phoenix as the lead singer for the post-grunge band Grey Daze. Bennington also collaborated with Phoenix musician DJ Z-Trip. This period also saw the formation and rise of pop punk/emo band Jimmy Eat World. Bob Stubbs, formerly of Social Distortion, played drums in local bands. In the mid 1990s independent punk rock record labels, Bad Stain Records and Dirty Records both formed, signing various local punk bands at the time. Dirty Records released albums from the punk bands Dirty Laundry, Mandingo, The Twits, and Adam&#x27;s Alcoholic&#x27;s. Bad Stain Records released albums from Subject Mad, D-I-X, Corrupt Citizen, and Dirty Laundry, and released a popular series of compilation CD&#x27;s featuring various local punk and ska bands, as well as popular national bands including Less Than Jake, At The Drive In, Buckwild, The Weakerthans, Link 80, Yellowcard, and more!

The late 1990s and early 2000s saw an emerging rock scene in Phoenix and the surrounding areas.

Punk influenced artists included Where Eagles Dare, Authority Zero, Bad Stain Recording artists Against The Majority (ATM) and Numbers On Napkins, and Hit and Run Jimmy, Haunted Cologne, and Andrew Jackson Jihad. Psychostick, a comedy style rock band, was formed in Tempe. In 1998 a band from Phoenix toured the midwest called Thee illuminatix, catching the attention of Jello Biafra.

There was also a post-hardcore scene including bands like Scary Kids Scaring Kids, Blessthefall, Eyes Set To Kill, The Word Alive, Greeley Estates, and American Standards. The middle years of the decade was marked by the transition from hardcore punk into death metal with bands such as The Irish Front, Knights of the Abyss and Job for a Cowboy.

Pop Rock band The Summer Set is based out of Scottsdale.

Country music star Dierks Bentley is from Phoenix and Michelle Branch is from Sedona. Country star Marty Robbins had a #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit with &quot;El Paso&quot; in 1959.

Arizona residents who have had varying success on the &quot;American Idol&quot; show include Jordin Sparks who won the sixth season. She was later selected to sing the National Anthem at Super Bowl XLII, which happened to take place in her hometown of Glendale, Arizona. On the seventh season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, Arizona had two contestants make it to the final twelve. David Hernandez came in twelfth place while Brooke White made it to fifth place. The eighth season featured a regional audition at the Jobing.com Arena in Glendale on July 25, 2008. Several contestants made it to the &quot;Hollywood phase&quot; but only one made it into the final twelve: Scott MacIntyre, who came in eighth place. Despite this, Phoenix was called one of the &quot;year&#x27;s standout cities.&quot;

Phoenix is home to the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra.

Hispanic/Latino music has a large following here, and numerous import stores exist throughout the city for it. There are also several Spanish-language music radio stations. The annual Fiestas Patrias celebration brings Mexican groups including Los Tigres del Norte.

He died on March 17, 2005, at the age of 89, and was one of the first inductees to the Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame.

Travis Edmonson was named Tucson&#x27;s &quot;Singing Ambassador of Goodwill&quot; in 1975, a mayoral appointment that still stands today. Edmonson grew up in Nogales and spent time in Mexico developing a talent for singing and playing the native music of Mexico. Edmonson and his friend actor Roger Smith were active musicians at the University of Arizona. Edmonson went on to become a member of the Gateway Singers and was half of the folk and Mexican music duo Bud &amp; Travis that recorded intermittently from about 1958 to 1965, producing 10 albums.

<text>Simon Thassi ( &quot;Šīməʿōn haTassī&quot;; died 135) was the second son of Mattathias and thus a member of the Hasmonean family. 

==Names==

The name &quot;Thassi&quot; has a connotation of &quot;the Wise&quot;, a title which can also mean &quot;the Director&quot;, &quot;the Guide&quot;, &quot;the Man of Counsel&quot;, and &quot;the Zealous&quot;. This Simon is also sometimes distinguished as , , or (from Latin) .

==History==

Simon took a prominent part in the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid Empire led by his brothers, Judas Maccabaeus and Jonathan Apphus. The successes of the Jews rendered it expedient for the Seleucid leaders in Syria to show them special favour. Therefore, Antiochus VI appointed Simon &quot;strategus&quot;, or military commander, of the coastal region stretching from the Ladder of Tyre to Egypt. As &quot;strategus&quot;, Simon gained control of the cities of Beth-zur and Joppa, garrisoning them with Jewish troops, and built the fortress of Adida.

After the capture of Jonathan by the Seleucid general Diodotus Tryphon, Simon was elected leader by the people, assembled at Jerusalem. He at once completed the fortification of the capital, and made Joppa secure.

At Hadid he blocked the advance of Tryphon, who was attempting to enter the country and seize the throne of Syria. Realizing he could gain nothing by force, Tryphon demanded a ransom for Jonathan and for the release of Jonathan&#x27;s sons as hostages. Although Simon was aware that Tryphon would deceive him, both Josephus and 1 Maccabees state that he acceded to both demands so that the people might see that he had done everything possible for his brother. Jonathan was nevertheless treacherously assassinated, and the hostages were not returned. Simon thus became the sole leader of the people.

As an opponent of Diodotus Tryphon, Simon decided to side with the Seleucid king, Demetrius II, to whom he sent a deputation requesting freedom from taxation for the country. The fact that his request was granted implied recognition of the political independence of Judea.

He became the first prince of the Hebrew Hasmonean dynasty. He reigned from 142 to 135.

The Hasmonean dynasty was established by a resolution, adopted in 141 at a large assembly &quot;of the priests and the people and of the elders of the land, to the effect that Simon should be their leader and high priest forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet&quot;. Recognition of the new dynasty by the Roman Republic was accorded by the Senate about 139, when the delegation representing Simon was in Rome. Simon had made the Jewish people semi-independent of the Seleucid Empire.

In February 135, Simon and his two sons Mattathias and Judah were assassinated at a banquet at Dok by his son-in-law Ptolemy, the Seleucid governor at Jericho. Simon&#x27;s third son John Hyrcanus succeeded him as high priest and ruler of Judea but was unable to capture Ptolemy, initially because the latter held John&#x27;s mother hostage, and subsequently because his army disbanded in observance of the custom at the time of resting every seventh year.

==Legacy==
Simon (and its Hebrew form, Simeon) would go on to become the most popular male name for some three centuries afterward in both the Hasmonean Kingdom and Roman Judea. This was both to honor a Jewish hero who had attained independence for the Jewish state, as well as because &quot;Simon&quot; did not sound artificial or strange to Greek ears.

<text>Vienna has been an important center of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert and Johann Strauss II, among others, were associated with the city, with Schubert being born in Vienna. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music. Vienna&#x27;s status began its rise as a cultural center in the early 16th century, and was focused on instruments including the lute.

==Yodel==
Yodeling, a form of singing that involves rapid and repeated changes of register, was developed in the Alps. What Austria called it was &quot;juchizn&quot;.

==Rock and pop music==

Falco was the most popular Austrian solo artist throughout the 1980s. His song &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot; reached number one of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1986. His sudden death in 1998 in the Dominican Republic catapulted his music from the 1980s once again into the spotlight.

Although Austria is not exactly the biggest exporter of international rock and pop-bands, there are a few notable musicians and bands. Opus also made it in the charts worldwide as well. In the last few years, several music groups toured Europe and had commercial success in the international charts. The most prominent being Christina Stürmer. SheSays, who supported Bryan Adams on his European tour and some other bands like Cornerstone, are notable for their recent contributions. The bands Wanda and Bilderbuch became successful in the 2010s. Soap&amp;Skin has found international recognition as well, being known for her contributions to the score of the Netflix-series &quot;Dark&quot;, among other things.

Blackened death metal trio Belphegor currently leads the Austrian metal scene, which also includes Hollenthon, Pungent Stench, Abigor, Disharmonic Orchestra, Visions of Atlantis, Dornenreich, Summoning and Estatic Fear.

Christian Fennesz is an Austrian electronic musician. Other electronic musicians who call Austria home include Der Blutharsch, active in the Neofolk scene, as are Sturmpercht.

Drummer Thomas Lang was born in Vienna in 1967, and has played with artists such as Robert Fripp, Geri Halliwell and Robbie Williams.

One of the few international touring bands is Killed By 9V Batteries and Gasmac Gilmore from Vienna.

Yearly the Waves Vienna Music Festival &amp; Conference takes place in October. This festival is a showcase festival for European pop music acts.

==Classical music==

The Vienna Philharmonic is a classical music ensemble and tours throughout the year all over the world. Their New Year&#x27;s Day concert held in Vienna every year in the Musikverein is one of Europe&#x27;s most important classical concerts during the year.

==Electronic music==

There is a vital electronic music scene in Austria. Groups and artists include Parov Stelar, Bernhard Fleischmann, Kruder and Dorfmeister and Elektro Guzzi. Drum &#x27;n&#x27; Bass also has a healthy reputation, with internationally successful Artists like Camo &amp; Krooked, Disaszt, Ill.Skillz and Mefjus.

==Neue Deutsche Härte==

Neue Deutsche Härte (New German Hardness) is most popular in Austria and the rest of the German Sprachraum. Notable bands include Stahlhammer and L&#x27;Âme Immortelle, both of which have had some international success. The German band Samsas Traum is now based in Austria as well.

==Eurovision success==

At 2014, Conchita Wurst won the Eurovision Song Contest representing Austria. Conchita Wurst is a drag queen portrayed by Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Neuwirth, which sparked some controversy. Following the win, the 60th anniversary Eurovision was held in Vienna in 2015. This was the second Eurovision contest to be held in Austria, first one being in 1967, after the winning performance Merci, Chérie by Udo Jürgens.

<doc id="308392" wikidata="Q1224630" url="?curid=308392" title="Diggers">
<text>The Diggers were a group of religious and political dissidents in England, associated with a political ideology and programme resembling what would later be called agrarian socialism. Gerrard Winstanley and William Everard, amongst many others, were known as True Levellers in 1649, in reference to their split from the Levellers, and later became known as &quot;Diggers&quot; because of their attempts to farm on common land. Due to this and to their beliefs, the Diggers were driven from one county after another by the authorities.

The Diggers tried (by &quot;levelling&quot; land) to reform the existing social order with an agrarian lifestyle based on their ideas for the creation of small, egalitarian rural communities. They were one of a number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time. Their belief in economic equality was drawn from , which describes a community of believers that &quot;had all things in common&quot; instead of having personal property.

== Theory ==
In 1649, Gerrard Winstanley and 14 others published &quot;The True Levellers Standard Advanced&quot;, a pamphlet and manifesto in which they called themselves &quot;True Levellers&quot; to distinguish their ideas from those of the Levellers. Once they put their idea into practice and started to cultivate common land, both opponents and supporters began to call them &quot;Diggers&quot;. The Diggers&#x27; beliefs were informed by Winstanley&#x27;s writings which envisioned an ecological interrelationship between humans and nature, acknowledging the inherent connections between people and their surroundings; Winstanley declared that &quot;true freedom lies where a man receives his nourishment and preservation, and that is in the use of the earth&quot;. With this the Diggers sought to establish a communistic utopia.

The True Levellers advocated for an early form of public health insurance and communal ownership in opposition to individual ownership. They rejected the perceived immorality and sexual liberalism of another sect known as the Ranters, with Gerrard Winstanley denoting them as &quot;a general lack of moral values or restraint in worldly pleasures&quot;.

== Practice ==

=== St George&#x27;s Hill, Weybridge, Surrey ===

The Council of State received a letter in April 1649 reporting that several individuals had begun to plant vegetables in common land on St George&#x27;s Hill, Weybridge near Cobham, Surrey at a time when harvests were bad and food prices high. Sanders reported that they had invited &quot;all to come in and help them, and promise them meat, drink, and clothes&quot;. They intended to pull down all enclosures and cause the local populace to come and work with them. They claimed that their number would be several thousand within ten days. It was at this time that &quot;The True Levellers Standard Advanced&quot; was published.

Where exactly in St. George&#x27;s Hill the Diggers were is a matter of dispute. Sanders alleges that they worked &quot;on that side of the hill next to Campe Close&quot;. George Greenwood, however, speculated that the Diggers were &quot;somewhere near Silvermere Farm on the Byfleet Road rather than on the unprofitable slopes of St. George&#x27;s Hill itself&quot;.

Winstanley remained and continued to write about the treatment they received. The harassment from the lord of the manor, Francis Drake (not the famous Francis Drake, who had died more than 50 years before), was both deliberate and systematic: he organised gangs in an attack on the Diggers, including numerous beatings and an arson attack on one of the communal houses. Following a court case, in which the Diggers were forbidden to speak in their own defence, they were found guilty of being sexually liberal Ranters (though in fact Winstanley had reprimanded Ranter Laurence Clarkson for his sexual practices). If they had not left the land after losing the court case then the army could have been used to enforce the law and evict them; so they abandoned Saint George&#x27;s Hill in August 1649, much to the relief of the local freeholders.

=== Little Heath near Cobham ===
Some of the evicted Diggers moved a short distance to Little Heath in Surrey. were cultivated, six houses built, winter crops harvested, and several pamphlets published. After initially expressing some sympathy for them, the local lord of the manor of Cobham, Parson John Platt, became their chief enemy. He used his power to stop local people helping them and he organised attacks on the Diggers and their property. By April 1650, Platt and other local landowners succeeded in driving the Diggers from Little Heath.

=== Wellingborough, Northamptonshire ===

This community was probably founded as a result of contact with the Surrey Diggers. In late March 1650, four emissaries from the Surrey colony were arrested in Buckinghamshire bearing a letter signed by the Surrey Diggers including Gerrard Winstanley and Robert Coster inciting people to start Digger colonies and to provide money for the Surrey Diggers. According to the newspaper &quot;A Perfect Diurnall&quot; the emissaries had travelled a circuit through the counties of Surrey, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire before being apprehended.

On 15 April 1650 the Council of State ordered Mr Pentlow, a justice of the peace for Northamptonshire, to proceed against &quot;the Levellers in those parts&quot; and to have them tried at the next Quarter Session.

=== Iver, Buckinghamshire ===
Another colony of Diggers connected to the Surrey and Wellingborough colony was set up in Iver, Buckinghamshire about from the Surrey Diggers colony at St George&#x27;s Hill. The Iver Diggers&#x27; &quot;Declaration of the grounds and Reasons, why we the poor Inhabitants of the Parrish of Iver in Buckinghamshire ...&quot; revealed that there were further Digger colonies in Barnet in Hertfordshire, Enfield in Middlesex, Dunstable in Bedfordshire, Bosworth in Leicestershire and further colonies at unknown locations in Gloucestershire and Nottinghamshire. It also revealed that after the failure of the Surrey colony, the Diggers had left their children to be cared for by parish funds.

== Response ==
Oliver Cromwell and the Grandees&#x27; attitude to these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile.

== Influence ==
The San Francisco Diggers were a community-action group of activists and Street Theatre actors operating from 1966 to 1968, based in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco.

Since the revival of anarchism in the British anti-roads movement, the Diggers have been celebrated as precursors of land squatting and communalism.
On 1 April 1999, the 350th anniversary of the Diggers&#x27; occupation of the English Civil War on the same hill, The Land Is Ours organised a rally, then occupied land at St. George&#x27;s Hill near Weybridge, Surrey.

In 2011, an annual festival began in Wigan to celebrate the Diggers. In 2012, the second annual festival proved a great success and the sixth took place in 2016. In Wellingborough, a festival has also been held annually since 2011. Bolton Diggers were established in 2013 and have promoted the commons as a foil to privatisation. They have established community food gardens, cooperatives and the Common Wealth café, a pay-as-you-feel café using surplus food from supermarkets. The Manchester Urban Diggers, which operate out of Platt Fields Gardens, takes its name and ethos from the historical diggers, and supports developing food sovereignty through &quot;educational services and growing fruit, vegetables and herbs to make available to the local community&quot;.

=== Influence on literature and popular culture ===
* In 1966, a faction of the San Francisco Mime Troupe formed a Diggers group in the hippie community in the Haight–Ashbury district of San Francisco. A strongly anti-establishment group, they handed out free food in Golden Gate Park.
* &quot;The World Turned Upside Down&quot; by Leon Rosselson, 1975, a song about the Diggers and their activities on St. George&#x27;s Hill in 1649; this song was also performed by numerous other artists, including:
** Dick Gaughan on his album &quot;Handful of Earth&quot;, 1981
** The Barracudas on their album &quot;Endeavour to Persevere&quot;, 1984
** Billy Bragg on his &quot;Between the Wars&quot; EP, 1985
** Chumbawamba on the b-side of their single &quot;Timebomb&quot;, 1993
** Four to the Bar on &quot;Another Son&quot; in 1995
** Attila the Stockbroker with Barnstormer on &quot;The Siege of Shoreham&quot;, 1996
** Oysterband on their albums &quot;Shouting End of life&quot; and &quot;Alive and Shouting&quot;, 1995 and 1996
** Karan Casey (formerly of the Irish band Solas), on her album &quot;Songlines&quot;, 1997
** Clandestine, a Houston-based Celtic group, on their album &quot;To Anybody at All&quot;, 1999
** Ramshackle Glory on the album &quot;Live the Dream&quot;, 2016
* &quot;Winstanley&quot;, a fictionalised 1975 film portrait of the Diggers, directed by Kevin Brownlow, was based upon the novel &quot;Comrade Jacob&quot; by David Caute.
* &quot;As Meat Loves Salt&quot; by Maria McCann, Harcourt, 2001 () deals in part with the founding and destruction of a fictional Digger colony at Page Common near London.
* Caryl Churchill&#x27;s 1976 play &quot;Light Shining in Buckinghamshire&quot;, named after the Digger pamphlet and set in the English Civil War, charts the rise and fall of the Diggers and other social ideas from the 1640s.
* Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Antkind&quot; references Winstanley and the Diggers. A character called &quot;Digger&quot; is given a copy of &quot;The True Levellers Standard Advanced&quot; in order to motivate her to revolt against an oppressive government.

<doc id="308394" wikidata="Q2206345" url="?curid=308394" title="Diggers (theater)">
<text>The Diggers were a radical community-action group of activists and street theatre actors operating from 1966 to 1968, based in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco. Their politics have been categorized as &quot;left-wing;&quot; more accurately, they were &quot;community anarchists&quot; who blended a desire for freedom with a consciousness of the community in which they lived. The Diggers&#x27; central tenet was to be &quot;authentic,&quot; seeking to create a society free from the dictates of money and capitalism.

The Diggers were closely associated and shared a number of members with the guerrilla theater group San Francisco Mime Troupe. They were formed out of after-hours Mime Troupe discussions between Emmett Grogan, Peter Coyote, Peter Berg, and Billy Landout.

The Diggers fostered and inspired later groups like the Yippies.

== Origins ==
The Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers (1649–1650) who had promulgated a vision of society free from buying, selling, and private property. During the mid- and late 1960s, the San Francisco Diggers organized free music concerts and works of political art, provided free food, medical care, transport, and temporary housing and opened stores that gave away stock. Some of their events included the Death of Money Parade, Intersection Game, Invisible Circus, and Death of Hippie/Birth of Free.

== Publishing ==

One of the first Digger activities was the publishing of various broadsides, which were printed by sneaking into the local Students for a Democratic Society office and using their Gestetner printer. The leaflets were eventually called &quot;The Digger Papers&quot;, and soon morphed into small pamphlets with poetry, psychedelic art, and essays. The first issue of &quot;The Digger Papers&quot; was published in Fall 1965. Peter Berg was one of the regular contributors to the publication.

&quot;The Digger Papers&quot; originated such phrases as &quot;Do your own thing&quot; and &quot;Today is the first day of the rest of your life.&quot;

They often included statements that mocked the prevailing attitude of the counterculture promoted by less-radical figures like the Haight-Independent Proprietors (HIP), Timothy Leary, and Richard Alpert. The first paper mocked the acid community, saying &quot;Time to forget because flowers are beautiful and the sun&#x27;s not yellow, it&#x27;s chicken!&quot; They rarely included authors&#x27; names, though some had pseudonyms like &quot;George Metevsky,&quot; a reference to the &quot;Mad Bomber&quot; George Metesky. (After some HIP members tried to find out who the Diggers were, Grogan and Landout responded with a telegram: &quot;REGARDING INQUIRIES CONCERNED WITH THE IDENTITY AND WHEREABOUTS OF THE DIGGERS; HAPPY TO REPORT THE DIGGERS ARE NOT THAT.&quot;) 

The &quot;1% Free&quot; poster, showing two Chinese Tong assassins under the Chinese character for &quot;revolution,&quot; was thought to be demanding a 1% tithe from merchants, but that was not the case. The poster was a challenge, implicitly suggesting that &quot;free&quot; people were the minority, and inciting others to step up.

=== The Communications Company (ComCo) ===
Writers Chester Anderson and Claude and Helene Hayward helped found the publishing arm of the Diggers, known as the Communications Company (ComCo). Using &quot;two &#x27;beautiful&#x27; Gestetner mimeograph machines that had been nefariously obtained through the offices of &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine,&quot; the Communications Company distributed daily (and sometimes hourly) broadsides on the streets of the Haight-Ashbury district during the early part of 1967 and the Summer of Love. ComCo was a member of the Underground Press Syndicate, a network of countercultural newspapers and magazines.

Through the Communications Company, Anderson circulated a number of his own bitter broadside polemics in the Haight, including, in April 1967, &quot;Uncle Tim&#x27;$ Children,&quot; with its infamous, often-quoted line, &quot;Rape is as common as bullshit on Haight Street.&quot;

Richard Brautigan&#x27;s poem &quot;All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace&quot; was first published, in March 1967, by the Communication Company on an mimeographed broadside with both the title and imprint handwritten. The first run included a picture of a megaphone, and a second printing had an image of people working on a large computer, rotated to run vertically beside the poem, with simple line drawings of animals all over the page. In April of the same year, the Communication Company published it again as the title poem in the collection by the same name. It included 36 typewritten yellow pages measuring , in a print run of 1,500, all of which were given away for free. Brautigan then gave permission to The Diggers to include the poem in the final edition of &quot;The Digger Papers&quot;, published in August 1968.

Also in March 1967, ComCo distributed Willard S. Bain&#x27;s &quot;Informed Sources: Day East Received&quot;, a satirical allegory of the assassination of John F. Kennedy in the form of fictional news wire bulletins, in an edition of about 500 mimeographed copies.

The Communications Company also published Harry Driggs&#x27; pioneering underground comic &quot;The Life and Loves of Cleopatra&quot; (June 1967), an obscene 28-page narrative inspired by the Elizabeth Taylor film &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, and which featured artwork that today would be seen as child pornography. The Diggers gave away the comic in their free store at the corner of Cole and Carl in Haight-Ashbury. 

Joan Didion described the role Chester Anderson and ComCo played in Haight-Ashbury in her 1967 essay for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot;, which was later included in the book of the same name.

== Parties, theater events, and happenings ==
The Diggers threw free parties with music provided by the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane and other bands. They also staged street theater events, such as driving a truck of semi-naked belly dancers through the Financial District, inviting brokers to climb on board and forget their work.

On December 17, 1966, the Diggers held a happening called &quot;The Death of Money&quot; in which they dressed in animal masks and carried a large coffin full of fake money down Haight Street, singing &quot;Get out my life, why don’t you babe?&quot; to the tune of Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March&quot; (or &quot;Death March&quot;). 

This was a precursor to the happening &quot;The Death of Hippie,&quot; staged in October 1967, in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. Masked participants carried a coffin with the words &quot;Hippie—Son of Media&quot; on the side. This event was meant to mark the end of the hippie era of Haight-Ashbury. The event was staged so as to make any media outlet that simply described the happening to unintentionally transmit the Diggers&#x27; message that Hippies were a media invention. This was called &quot;creating the condition you describe&quot;. The Diggers skillfully used this technique for media relations.

== Free stores, food, medical care ==
The Diggers opened numerous free stores in Haight-Ashbury which offered discarded but usable items, free for the taking or giving. The first free store was in a six-car garage on Page Street that they found filled with empty picture frames; they tacked these up outside the building and called it the Free Frame of Reference.

The Diggers provided free food service in the Panhandle of Golden Gate Park every day at four o&#x27;clock, feeding about 100 people with a stew from donated meat and vegetables that was served from behind a giant yellow picture frame, also called the Free Frame of Reference, which people were required to step through before being served.

This was superseded by the Trip Without a Ticket on Frederick Street. It was unclear how the stores were funded.

The Diggers also opened a free medical clinic, initially by inviting volunteers from the University of California, San Francisco medical school up the hill from the neighborhood.

The free food and medical clinics were immediate responses to conditions caused by the enormous influx of young people during the heyday of the hippie scene, conditions that the San Francisco government was ignoring.

=== Digger Bread ===
The Diggers also popularized whole wheat bread: their Digger Bread was baked in coffee cans at the Free Bakery in the basement of Episcopal All Saints Church on 1350 Waller Street. In cooperation with All Saints Church and later via the Haight Ashbury Switchboard at 1830 Fell Street, they arranged free &quot;crashpad&quot; housing for homeless youth drawn to the Haight-Ashbury area.

== Division of labor ==
The Diggers&#x27; division of labor between men and women has been criticized as sexist, with male members primarily forming ideas while female members were tasked with most of the practical work to realize these ideas. For instance, in providing free food, the men socialized and promoted the events, while the women did most of the collecting, cooking and serving. Decision-making in the organization was controlled by male Diggers, who either came up with or took credit for new ideas, while female Diggers, who provided much of the organization&#x27;s income via welfare checks and social assistance, were sidelined. This stratification &quot;typifies prefeminist-era radicalism in the sixties.&quot;

== Leaving San Francisco ==
Running soup kitchens and medical clinics, however, was not the authentic, long-term concern of the Diggers&#x27; founders. After passing those institutions on to a local church and David E. Smith to continue, the Diggers moved out of the city, creating various land bases in California, including Forest Knolls, Olema, Covelo, Salmon River, Trinidad, and Black Bear Ranch. There they integrated with other groups — The Free Bakery, the Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers, and the Gypsy Truckers — creating The Free Family. 

That larger group still exists informally, and many of the Diggers&#x27; children and grandchildren remain in contact with one another, and many are still involved with progressive causes.

== In media ==
Various alternative communities like those of the Diggers were covered in a feature-length documentary film by Will Vinton, later known for his ClayMation studio in Portland, Oregon. This early-1970s documentary (1974 according to one source) was titled &quot;Gone for a Better Deal&quot;, but it has never been released in any video format.

Haight-Ashbury Golden-Gate park poet Ashleigh Brilliant, later known for his &quot;pot-Shots&quot; epigrams, released a CD of his songs and parodies about &quot;life in the Haight,&quot; including two songs about the Diggers.

A fictionalized version of the Diggers was featured in Haleh Roshan&#x27;s play &quot;Free Free Free Free&quot;.

<doc id="308397" wikidata="Q704081" url="?curid=308397" title="Balearic shearwater">
<text>The Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) is a medium-sized shearwater in the seabird family &quot;Procellariidae&quot;. &quot;Puffinus&quot; is a Neo-Latin loanword based on the English &quot;puffin&quot; and its variants, that referred to the cured carcass of the fat nestling of the Manx shearwater, a former delicacy. The specific &quot;mauretanicus&quot; refers to Mauretania, an old name for an area of North Africa roughly corresponding to Morocco and Algeria. The Balearic Shearwater is listed critically endangered by the IUCN and is one of Europe&#x27;s most endangered seabirds.

==Taxonomy==
The Balearic shearwater was formerly described in 1921 by the English ornithologist Percy Lowe. He treated it as a subspecies of the Manx shearwater and coined the trinomial name &quot;Puffinus puffinus mauretanicus&quot;.

The Balearic shearwater was long regarded a subspecies of the Manx shearwater. Following an initial split, it was held to be a subspecies of the &quot;Mediterranean shearwater&quot; for nearly ten more years, until it was resolved to be a distinct species, separate from the yelkouan shearwater. It is the last taxon of the &quot;Puffinus&quot; complex that was recognized as a separate entity.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2021 found very little genetic difference between the Balearic shearwater and the yelkouan shearwater (&quot;Puffinus yelkouan&quot;). The authors of the study suggested that these two taxa might be better considered as conspecific.

It appears to belong to a group of Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic species which includes the yelkouan shearwater and one to three prehistorically extinct taxa, Hole&#x27;s and possibly also Olson&#x27;s shearwater and an undescribed form of unclear distinctness from Menorca. The two living Mediterranean lineages had probably separated before the end of the Pliocene (c. 2 mya), as indicated by molecular differences and the Ibizan fossil &quot;Puffinus nestori&quot; from the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene, which may have been the direct ancestor of the present species.
==Description==
Balearic shearwater is in length and has a wingspan of . It has the typically &quot;shearing&quot; flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from dark brown to dirty white as the dark upperparts and paler undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.

Apart from its less contrasting plumage, this species is very similar to the Manx and yelkouan shearwaters found elsewhere in the Mediterranean. At least one mixed breeding colony of Balearic and yelkouan shearwaters exists on Menorca, and the species&#x27; winter ranges overlap in the Central Mediterranean; for scientific purposes at least, a combination of morphological characteristics and DNA sequence data is suggested to identify the species.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species breeds on islands and coastal cliffs in the Balearic islands. Most winter in that sea, but some enter the Atlantic in late summer, reaching north to Great Britain and Ireland.

==Behaviour==
This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially in autumn. It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls, higher pitched than the Manx shearwater&#x27;s.
===Breeding===
This species nests in burrows and caves which are visited only at night to avoid predation by large gulls.

===Feeding===
The Balearic shearwater feeds on fish and molluscs. It does not follow boats.

==Conservation and threats==
The Balearic shearwater is considered critically endangered with extinction by the IUCN. Recent models estimate a mean decrease of 7.4% per year and a mean extinction time of 40.4 years. This equates to an ongoing decline of more than 80% over the next three generations (54 years). It is under severe threat from the development of holiday resorts near its breeding sites. These can destroy or alter its natural breeding habitat by, for example, producing light pollution around nesting colonies. Predation from introduced animals such as cats and rats also cause problems. The discovery of yelkouan shearwaters in the Menorcan colony suggests that hybridization may also pose a problem. A further problem for conservation of the Balearic Shearwater is that 25 official languages are spoken across its distribution, hampering the dissemination of conservation information. The Balearic shearwater is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels applies.

In 1965, at the age of 17, she won the tenth edition of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;, representing Luxembourg. Later in her career, she worked with singer-songwriter Michel Berger, whom she married in 1976. Her most successful singles include &quot;, &quot; and &quot;.

==Early life==
Gall was born in Paris on 9 October 1947, to a highly musical family. Her father, the lyricist Robert Gall, wrote songs for Édith Piaf and Charles Aznavour. Her mother, Cécile Berthier, was a singer as well and the daughter of Paul Berthier, the co-founder of Les Petits Chanteurs à la Croix de Bois. The only daughter of her family, France had two brothers: Patrice and Philippe. In spring 1963, Robert Gall encouraged his daughter to record songs and send the demos to the music publisher Denis Bourgeois. That July, she auditioned for Bourgeois at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, after which Bourgeois wanted to sign her immediately. France was subsequently signed to Philips.

At the time, Bourgeois was working for the label as artistic director for Serge Gainsbourg and assumed this role for Gall as well. He encouraged her to record four tracks with the French jazz musician, arranger and composer Alain Goraguer.

==Career==
===Early career===
The first airplay of Gall&#x27;s first single &quot;Ne sois pas si bête&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Be So Stupid&quot;) occurred on her 16th birthday. It was released in November and became a hit, selling 200,000 copies. Gainsbourg, who had released several albums and written songs for singers including Michèle Arnaud and Juliette Gréco, was asked by Bourgeois to write songs for Gall. Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;N&#x27;écoute pas les idoles&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t listen to the idols&quot;) was Gall&#x27;s second single; it reached the top of the French charts in March 1964 and stayed there for three weeks.

At the same time, Gall made her live debut, opening for Sacha Distel in Belgium. She teamed with Distel&#x27;s business manager Maurice Tézé, a lyricist, which allowed her to create an original repertoire, unlike the majority of her contemporaries who sang adaptations of Anglophone hits. Elaborate orchestrations by Alain Goraguer blended styles, permitting her to navigate among jazz, children&#x27;s songs, and other genres. Examples of this mixed-genre style included &quot;Jazz à gogo&quot; (by Alain Goraguer and Robert Gall) and &quot;Mes premières vraies vacances&quot; (by Jacques Datin and Maurice Vidalin). Gall and Gainsbourg&#x27;s association produced many popular singles, continuing through the summer of 1964 with the hit song &quot;Laisse tomber les filles&quot; (&quot;Leave the girls alone&quot;) followed by &quot;Christiansen&quot; by Datin-Vidalin. Gainsbourg also secretly recorded Gall&#x27;s laughter to use on &quot;&quot;, a track on his 1964 album &quot;Gainsbourg Percussions&quot;.

===1965===
Having previously resisted, Gall gave in to her managers at the end of 1964 and recorded a single intended for children. The song &quot;Sacré Charlemagne&quot;, written by her father, and set to the music of George Liferman, was a hit in 1965, peaking at number one in France and number five in Turkey.

===Eurovision===
Gall was then selected to represent Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest 1965. From the 10 songs proposed to her, she chose Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Poupée de cire, poupée de son&quot;. On 20 March 1965, Gainsbourg, Gall, and Goraguer attended the finals of the song contest in Naples, where the song was &quot;allegedly booed in rehearsals for straying so far from the sort of song usually heard in the Contest at this point.&quot;

Although the delivery during the live show may not have been Gall&#x27;s strongest performance — one critic wrote that Gall&#x27;s performance was &quot;far from perfect,&quot; another noted that her voice was out of tune and her complexion pale, and when Gall called Claude François, her lover at the time, immediately after the performance, he shouted at her, &quot;You sang off key. You were terrible!&quot; — the song impressed the jury and it took the Grand Prix. Success at Eurovision ensured that Gall became even better known outside Europe and she recorded &quot;Poupée de cire, poupée de son&quot; in French, German, Italian and Japanese. There appears to be no English version released by France Gall, although there was an English cover version by the English 1960s star Twinkle.

===Summer tour===
In 1965, Gall toured France for several months with Le Grand Cirque de France (The Great Circus of France), a combination of radio show and live circus. Her singles continued to chart successfully, including the Gainsbourg-penned &quot;Attends ou va-t&#x27;en&quot; (&quot;Wait for me, or go away&quot;) and &quot;Nous ne sommes pas des anges&quot; (&quot;We are not angels&quot;). She also had a hit with the song &quot;L&#x27;Amérique&quot; (&quot;America&quot;) by Eddy Marnay and Guy Magenta.

Stewart Mason states this early period of Gall&#x27;s career, culminating in the Eurovision win:[A]lthough many dismissed Gall as a Francophone Lesley Gore, making fluffy and ultra-commercial pop hits with little substance, Gall&#x27;s hits from this era stand up far better than most. Only Françoise Hardy was consistently making records up to these standards during this era. Though Gall&#x27;s high, breathy voice was admittedly somewhat limited, she made the most of it. Even dopey hits like &quot;Sacré Charlemagne&quot;, a duet with a pair of puppets who were the stars of a children&#x27;s show on French TV, have an infectious, zesty charm; meatier tunes, like the sultry jazz-tinged ballad &quot;Pense a Moi&quot; and the brilliant rocker &quot;Laisse tomber les filles&quot;, were as good as any single produced in the U.S. or Great Britain at the time.

===1966===
In 1966, her children&#x27;s song &quot;Les Leçons particulières&quot; (&quot;Private lessons&quot;) caused notoriety and displeasure; the same occurred when Jean-Christophe Averty choreographed a troupe of men on all fours to accompany her children&#x27;s song, &quot;J&#x27;ai retrouvé mon chien&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve found my dog&quot;), on his television programme &quot;Les Raisins verts&quot;.

Also in 1966, Gall released another successful song written by Gainsbourg titled &quot;Les sucettes&quot; (Lollipops). Although the song was ostensibly about a young girl who likes aniseed-flavoured lollipops, plays-on-words in the lyrics implied another meaning, that of oral sex. Gall was 18 at the time the song was released, and she maintained that she was ignorant of the song&#x27;s double entendres. She said she had sung &quot;with an innocence of which I&#x27;m proud&quot; and later said that this humiliation caused her to avoid going out in public after being &quot;betrayed by the adults around me&quot;. She then refused to sing the song and vowed never to work with Gainsbourg again. Gall left for a tour in Japan shortly after the song was released and it has been stated that she felt mistrust for producers until meeting Michel Berger.

===Psychedelic era and transition to adulthood===
At the beginning of 1967, Gall sang &quot;La Petite&quot; in a duet with Maurice Biraud, which describes a young girl coveted by a friend of her father. The controversy over this performance overshadowed her release that year of Gainsbourg&#x27;s poetic &quot;Néfertiti&quot;. Her next single was recorded with the orchestration of the English composer David Whitaker. New authors Frank Thomas and were brought on board. They wrote &quot;Bébé requin&quot; (&quot;Baby Shark&quot;), a song which was a success for Gall at the end of 1967, her last one for six years.

This was followed by &quot;Teenie Weenie Boppie&quot;, an anti-LSD song by Gainsbourg, which has been described as &quot;a bizarre tune about a deadly LSD trip that somehow involves Mick Jagger&quot;. Gainsbourg then sang an anti-capital punishment song with Gall, &quot;Qui se souvient de Caryl Chessman?&quot; (&quot;Who remembers Caryl Chessman?&quot;), about a prisoner on death row.

Stewart Mason wrote about this period: &quot;The psychedelic era found Gall, under Gainsbourg&#x27;s guidance, singing increasingly strange songs ... set to some of Gainsbourg&#x27;s most out-there arrangements.&quot;
Her next record &quot;C&#x27;est toi que je veux&quot;, again with Whitaker, also failed to make an impact. With this string of recordings in the late 1960s, none of them an unmitigated success, and making the transition from teenage to adult performer, Gall faced some challenges in this period through the early 1970s. Mason wrote,No longer a teenager, but without a new persona to redefine herself with, (and without the help of Gainsbourg, whose time was taken by his own albums and those of his wife Jane Birkin), Gall floundered both commercially and artistically. A label change from Philips to BASF in 1972 didn&#x27;t help matters ...&quot;

===German-language career===
Although struggling in her home country, Gall regularly recorded in Germany from 1966 to 1972, in particular with the composer and orchestrator Werner Müller. She had a successful German career with songs by Horst Buchholz and Giorgio Moroder: &quot;Love, l&#x27;amour und Liebe&quot; (1967), &quot;Hippie, hippie&quot; (1968), &quot;Ich liebe dich, so wie du bist&quot; (&quot;I love you the way you are&quot;) (1969) and &quot;Mein Herz kann man nicht kaufen&quot; (&quot;My heart is not for sale&quot;) (1970). Her other German hits included &quot;Haifischbaby (Bébé requin)&quot;, &quot;Die schönste Musik, die es gibt&quot; (&quot;The most beautiful music there is&quot;/&quot;Music to Watch Girls By&quot;), &quot;Was will ein Boy&quot; (&quot;What does a boy want?&quot;) (1967), &quot;Ja, ich sing&quot; (&quot;Yes, I sing&quot;), &quot;A Banda (Zwei Apfelsinen im Haar)&quot; (&quot;Two oranges in my hair&quot;), &quot;Der Computer Nr. 3&quot; (1968), &quot;Ein bisschen Goethe, ein bisschen Bonaparte&quot; (&quot;A bit of Goethe, a bit of Bonaparte&quot;), &quot;I like Mozart&quot; (1969), &quot;Dann schon eher der Piano player&quot; (&quot;I prefer the piano player&quot;) (1970), &quot;Ali Baba und die 40 Räuber&quot; (&quot;Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves&quot;) (1971), &quot;Komm mit mir nach Bahia, Miguel&quot; (&quot;Come with me to Bahia, Miguel&quot;) (1972).

===Post-Gainsbourg career: New label, new beginnings===
Gall had several other releases in France in 1968, none of which aroused any great interest. At the end of 1968, on reaching the age of 21, Gall separated from Denis Bourgeois and spread her wings upon the expiration of her contract with Philips. She moved to the record label La Compagnie in 1969, with whom her father Robert signed a contract, where she made a number of recordings, but did not succeed in finding a coherent style with Norbert Saada as artistic director.

She went her own way in 1969 with two adaptations: one Italian and the other British: &quot;L&#x27;Orage/La Pioggia)&quot; (&quot;The Storm&quot;) which she sang with Gigliola Cinquetti at the 1969 Sanremo Music Festival, and &quot;Les Années folles&quot; (&quot;Gentlemen Please&quot;), created by Barbara Ruskin. Ruskin had actually released it as a single herself that year on the President label. Gall&#x27;s version made the Ultratop 50 Singles chart in Belgium that year. She also had it released in Spanish as &quot;Los años locos&quot;.

Her songs &quot;Des gens bien élevés&quot;, &quot;La Manille et la révolution&quot;, &quot;Zozoï&quot; and &quot;Éléphants&quot; were largely ignored. La Compagnie went bankrupt within three years of its creation, co-founder and singer Hugues Aufray&#x27;s blaming the failure entirely on Norbert Saada.

The early 1970s continued to be a barren period for Gall. Although she was the first artist to be recorded in France for Atlantic Records in 1971, her singles &quot;C&#x27;est cela l&#x27;amour&quot; (1971) and &quot;Chasse neige&quot; (1971), faltered in the charts. In 1972, Gall, for the last time, recorded songs by Gainsbourg, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Les Petits ballons&quot;, but these also failed to chart. The results of her collaboration with Jean-Michel Rivat as artistic director, &quot;La Quatrieme chose&quot; (1972), &quot;Par plaisir&quot; and &quot;Plus haut que moi&quot; (1973) all failed to meet with commercial success.
From the 1970s, Gall started regularly visiting Senegal. She bought a hideaway there on the island of N&#x27;Gor, close to Dakar in 1990.

===Collaboration with Michel Berger===
Gall was enthralled by Michel Berger&#x27;s music when she heard his song &quot;Attends-moi&quot; (&quot;Wait for Me&quot;) one day in 1973. During a later radio broadcast, she asked him for his opinion on songs which her then producer wanted her to record. Although he was disconcerted by the quality of the songs, there would be no question of collaboration.

In 1974, after she sang vocals on the song &quot;Mon fils rira du rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; on Berger&#x27;s new album, Gall&#x27;s publisher asked him, at her behest, to write for her. Gall had already made her mind up that &quot;It will be him and nobody else&quot;. In 1974, &quot;La Déclaration d&#x27;amour&quot; was to be the first in a long line of hits which marked a turning point in Gall&#x27;s career. Meanwhile, the two artists had fallen in love and married on 22 June 1976, the only marriage for both. After they married, Gall only sang songs written by Berger until his death in 1992.

In 1978, pushed by Berger, she again trod the boards of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, where she had auditioned 15 years earlier, starring in a show titled &quot;Made in France&quot;. The most novel aspect of this show was that, except for the Brazilian drag act Les Étoiles, the members of the orchestra, choir and the dance troupe were exclusively female. In this show, France sang &quot;Maria vai com as outras&quot; the original, Brazilian (Portuguese) version of &quot;Plus haut que moi&quot;.

In 1979, Gall took part in a show which remains memorable for many. Composed by Michel Berger and written by the Québécois author Luc Plamondon, the rock opera &quot;Starmania&quot; enjoyed a success not usual for musicals in France. The show played for one month at the Palais des congrès de Paris. In 1982, Gall rehearsed in the Palais des Sports of Paris to present &quot;Tout pour la musique&quot;, an innovative spectacle marked by its use of electronic music. The songs &quot;Résiste&quot; and &quot;Il jouait du piano debout&quot; (&quot;He played the piano standing&quot;) quickly became French pop standards.

===1980s and humanitarian projects===
In 1985, Gall joined Chanteurs Sans Frontières, on the initiative of Valérie Lagrange. She also worked for S.O.S Éthiopie for the benefit of Ethiopia under the aegis of Renaud. At the same time, she gave a successful series of concerts lasting three weeks at the new venue Le Zénith in Paris, where she performed new songs like &quot;Débranche&quot; (&quot;Loosen-up&quot;), &quot;Hong-Kong Star&quot;, and gave solid acoustic performances of &quot;Plus haut&quot;, &quot;Diego libre dans sa tête&quot; and &quot;Cézanne peint&quot;.

In 1985 and 1986, Gall worked with Berger, Richard Berry, Daniel Balavoine and for the benefit of Action Écoles, an organisation of schoolboy volunteers which collects essential food products in France for African countries where famine and drought prevail. On 14 January 1986, during a trip to Africa, Balavoine died in a helicopter crash. In 1987, the song &quot;Évidemment&quot;, written by Berger and sung by Gall, was a moving homage to their lost friend. The song appeared on the album &quot;Babacar&quot;.

On the same album, the song &quot;Babacar&quot; was about a child Gall and Berger had thought about adopting from Dakar, Senegal after meeting a mother who had begged Gall to take her child. Instead of adopting the child Berger and Gall decided to help financially by writing a song about the dilemma and donating the proceeds of the song to the child. The costs covered an apartment for the family and paid study costs for both the mother and child.

Gall topped the pop charts in many countries in 1987 and 1988 with another song from the &quot;Babacar&quot; album, &quot;Ella, elle l&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;Ella&#x27;s got it&quot;), a Berger tribute to Ella Fitzgerald. Following the release of &quot;Babacar&quot;, Gall launched a show produced by Berger. Opening at Le Zénith, the successful production toured throughout Europe, and gave rise to the live album &quot;Le Tour de France &#x27;88&quot;.

===1990s and later===
Gall took a break from singing in the early 1990s and did not record any more for several years. She did make an album titled &quot;Double Jeu&quot; with Berger, released 12 June 1992. Following the release of &quot;Double Jeu&quot;, Gall and Berger announced a series of concerts in various Parisian venues; this project was nearly cancelled by Berger&#x27;s death from a heart attack on 2 August 1992. Although Gall was strongly affected by Berger&#x27;s death, she wanted to complete the project they had planned. She decided to commit to the performances at Bercy and promoted the songs that she and Berger had created together.

She performed at the Bercy in September. All the songs she performed were written by Michel Berger from &quot;Double Jeu&quot;, and from their discographies. A year later, she performed in a show in the Salle Pleyel in Paris featuring new musicians. The repertoire featured songs written exclusively by Berger, but Gall included her own versions of songs originally performed by others.

In 1996, Gall asked Jean-Luc Godard to produce the video clip of her song &quot;Plus haut&quot;, taken from her album &quot;France&quot;. Godard initially refused, but later agreed, and directed a dreamy, picturesque video titled &quot;Plus Oh!&quot; near his residence in Rolle, Switzerland. It was given its first and only airing (due to copyright issues) on 20 April 1996 on the French television channel M6.

After a year in Los Angeles, she released her album &quot;France&quot; in 1996. The same year, she headlined at the Paris Olympia. In 1997, she announced her retirement and recorded an unplugged show for French television showcasing songs from her final album.

==Personal life==
Gall married her collaborator and songwriter Michel Berger on 22 June 1976. They had two children together, Pauline and Raphaël.

Her daughter Pauline was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis soon after she was born. She and Berger focused their hopes on the progress of medical research and to keep details of Pauline&#x27;s condition a secret from the public. She entered into a pact with her husband to alternate their professional projects to take care of their daughter in the hope that a cure would be found.

Michel Berger died of a heart attack in 1992 at age 44. In April 1993, Gall was diagnosed with breast cancer, which was successfully treated.

Pauline died in December 1997. Following the death of her daughter, Gall made only occasional public appearances.

She was a patron of the French charity Cœurs de Femmes and a regular poker player until her death.

==Film career==
After a TV film directed by Jean-Christophe Averty and dedicated to the songs of Gall was distributed in the United States in 1965, Gall was sought by Walt Disney to appear as Alice in a musical film version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, after having already made &quot; Alice&quot; into a cartoon in 1951. Although Gall had insisted she did not want to become involved in film work, this was the only project which appealed to her. The project was cancelled after Disney&#x27;s death in 1966.

In 1966, Gall appeared in the television film &quot;Viva Morandi&quot;, made in the same psychoanalytical mould as the (1965) Federico Fellini film &quot;Giulietta degli Spiriti&quot; (&quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot;). She played La Grâce alongside Christine Lebail, who played La Pureté, both singing &quot;Les Sucettes&quot; in a segment which was prominently labelled &quot;Fantasy&quot; in a clear reference to the song&#x27;s sexual undertones. 

In 1993, she considered appearing on screen for a cinematographic collaboration with her best friend, screenwriter Telsche Boorman. This planned project was never completed due to Boorman&#x27;s death in 1996.

In January 2010, Gall was portrayed by Sara Forestier in a feature film released in France, &quot;Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque)&quot;, based on the graphic novel by writer-director Joann Sfar.

==Death and legacy==

As a farewell to her career, &quot;France Gall par France Gall&quot;, a documentary movie was shot in 2001, and millions watched the documentary when it was broadcast on French television that year. She staged and appeared in the 2007 France 2 documentary &quot;Tous pour la musique&quot;, marking the 15th anniversary of Michel Berger&#x27;s death.

A long-term breast cancer survivor, Gall died, aged 70, of an infection after a two-year battle with a cancer of undisclosed primary origin, at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 7 January 2018.

She was buried with her husband and daughter on 20 Avenue Rachel (division 29) at Montmartre Cemetery in Paris.

On 9 October 2023, Google celebrated what would have been her 76th birthday, five and a half years after her death, with a Google Doodle.

<text>John Charles Layfield (born November 29, 1966), better known by the ring name John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield, is an American retired professional wrestler and football player. He is currently signed to WWE, where he is an ambassador and commentator for the company.

Layfield rose to prominence in WWE during its Attitude Era under the ring name Bradshaw, during which time he became a three-time WWF Tag Team Champion with Ron Simmons as part of the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) or simply the Acolytes, a feared pair of strong and tough mercenaries who, aside from occasionally wrestling and doing &quot;work&quot; for &quot;clients&quot; spent most of their time sitting around in their &quot;office&quot; playing cards, drinking beer, fighting people backstage and then going out to bars and getting into bar fights. In 2004, Simmons retired and the APA separated, and Layfield was rebranded as the heel character JBL— a rough-mannered, brawling, blustering, bad-tempered and bigmouthed Texas elite businessman, driven into the arena by limousine. The gimmick was built off of Layfield&#x27;s real-life accomplishments as a stock market investor. Later that year, he captured the WWE Championship and held it for 280 days. A month before his in-ring retirement at 2009&#x27;s WrestleMania 25, he became Intercontinental Champion, which made him the 20th Triple Crown Champion and the 10th Grand Slam Champion in WWE history.

After his retirement, Layfield became an on-air commentator for WWE programming. Layfield was inducted into the 2021 WWE Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2020. Layfield is currently a finance commentator and is featured regularly on Fox News and Fox Business. He is also employed by Northeast Securities as its senior vice president.

== Early life ==
Layfield was born on November 29, 1966, in Sweetwater, Texas.

== Football career ==
Layfield was a collegiate American football player for Trinity Valley Community College and for Abilene Christian University. At Abilene, Layfield was a two-year starter on the offensive line and was named first-team All-Lone Star Conference as a junior and senior. Layfield signed with the Los Angeles Raiders as an undrafted free agent, but was released before the 1990 season began. Layfield did play in the World League of American Football, starting all ten games of the 1991 season at right tackle for the San Antonio Riders, wearing jersey number 61. Future Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett was the quarterback of that team.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1992–1996) ===
Layfield was trained initially by Black Bart and Brad Rheingans. He debuted in September 1992 in the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in Texas. His first gimmick was as &quot;John Hawk,&quot; storyline cousin of the Windham brothers. He formed the tag team &quot;Texas Mustangs&quot; with Bobby Duncum Jr.; they quickly won the GWF Tag Team Championship from Rough Riders (Black Bart and Johnny Mantell) on November 27 but dropped the titles to The Bad Breed (Ian and Axl Rotten) on January 29, 1993.

In January 1993, Layfield went on his first overseas trip to Japan, wrestling for George and Shunji Takano&#x27;s Network of Wrestling. Later that same year, he would also wrestle in Mexico for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), wrestling under the name &quot;Vampiro Americano&quot; and frequently teamed with Vampiro Canadiense. He would also wrestle for Federacion Internacional de Lucha Libre, where he won its Heavyweight Championship. Hawk won his second GWF Tag Team Championship with Black Bart on December 25, 1993, from Steve Dane and Chaz Taylor, eventually losing them to The Fabulous Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin and Terry Gordy) on June 3, 1994.

In June 1994, he went to Europe and toured Austria and Germany for Otto Wanz&#x27;s Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) for the remainder of the year. In January 1995, Layfield joined NWA Dallas. He won the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship on January 14, 1995, defeating Kevin Von Erich. Two months later, he lost the NWA North American title to Greg Valentine. He wrestled for NWA Dallas until May 1995.

In June 1995, Layfield returned to Japan, but with NOW recently folded, he went to Genichiro Tenryu&#x27;s WAR, where he went by the name &quot;Death Mask.&quot; From June to December 1995, he wrestled in Austria and Germany for the Catch Wrestling Association, where he won its World Tag Team Championship with Cannonball Grizzly in November 1995. He was set to join Smoky Mountain Wrestling in December 1995, to wrestle Buddy Landel, but this did not happen due to the company closing in November. From December 1995 to February 1996, he performed for the Confederate Wrestling Alliance in Dallas, Texas.

=== World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE (1995–present)===
==== Early years (1995–1997) ====
In December 1995, Layfield (as &quot;John Hawk&quot;) debuted in the World Wrestling Federation, losing to Savio Vega in a dark match. He made his televised debut on the January 27, 1996, episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; as &quot;Justin &#x27;Hawk&#x27; Bradshaw,&quot; defeating Bob Holly in his debut match. His initial gimmick was that of a rough and tumble Texas cowboy (similar in terms of appearance and character to Stan Hansen), with Uncle Zebakiah as his manager. After victories, he branded his opponents with the symbol &quot;JB&quot; in ink, rather than being seared into the flesh. Bradshaw remained undefeated for three months until a loss to The Undertaker via disqualification on the April 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. He lost a Caribbean Strap Match to Savio Vega on the September 22, 1996, PPV In Your House 10: Mind Games. The character fizzled out by the end of the year, perhaps remembered only for a feud with Savio Vega and a match with Fatu which he won in eight seconds. Following a handicap match loss to Jesse James on December 9, Bradshaw attacked Zebekiah, who accidentally cost them the match. Afterwards, Bradshaw would work in house shows until February 1997.

==== The New Blackjacks (1997–1998) ====

In February 1997, Layfield paired up with his storyline cousin Barry Windham to form The New Blackjacks, Layfield cut off his long hair and completed with the traditional &quot;Blackjack&quot; handlebar mustaches and short, dyed black hair. In late 1997 Bradshaw traveled to the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) where he competed as a singles wrestler (without Windham). During his time in the USWA he helped his former manager in the WWF, Dutch Mantel (also known in the WWF as Uncle Zebekiah) defeat Jerry Lawler for the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship.

Windham&#x27;s injuries piled up throughout 1997 and Layfield wrestled only occasionally on TV as Blackjack Bradshaw worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling from November to December of that year. The team disbanded in January 1998. He earned a shot at the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship against Jeff Jarrett at No Way Out of Texas: In Your House and won by disqualification, but Jarrett retained the title because a title cannot change hands by a disqualification. In 1998, he wrestled as a mid-carder wrestling the likes of Marc Mero at Mayhem in Manchester, Kaientai (Funaki, Dick Togo, and Men&#x27;s Teioh) with Taka Michinoku in a handicap match at Over the Edge in which Michinoku was pinned. Sometimes teaming with fellow Texan Terry Funk. He defeated Vader in a Falls Count Anywhere Match at which was won by Bradshaw.

==== Acolytes Protection Agency (1998–2002) ====
On Sunday Night Heat right before Survivor Series 1998, Bradshaw teamed alongside former Nation of Domination leader Faarooq to form the tag team of the Acolytes, managed by the Jackyl. Their main gimmick was that of a dark duo known for their unrepentant savagery against their opponents, occult symbols painted on their chest and the Necronomicon &quot;gate of Yog-Sothoth&quot; pentagram symbol on their black tights. Bradshaw would grow a goatee and let his hair go long. After the Jackyl left the WWF, Faarooq and Bradshaw joined The Undertaker&#x27;s new Ministry of Darkness. The Ministry went on to feud with the Corporation. As part of the Ministry, Bradshaw feuded with Ken Shamrock. The two stables would soon unite as the Corporate Ministry, but disbanded after Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Undertaker at Fully Loaded. When the Undertaker went on hiatus in September, Bradshaw and Faarooq&#x27;s dark gimmick faded.

On the May 31, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, the Acolytes (still with the Corporate Ministry) won their first WWF Tag Team Championship by defeating Kane and X-Pac. On the July 5 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, they dropped the titles to the Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) before defeating the Hardyz and their manager Michael &quot;P.S.&quot; Hayes at Fully Loaded for their second WWF Tag Team Championship. On the August 9 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, they lost the titles to Kane and X-Pac.

The duo became fan favorites and changed their gimmick to that of cigar-smoking bar brawlers for hire. In jeans and T-shirts, Faarooq and Bradshaw became the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA), with a motto of &quot;because we need beer money.&quot; The duo was often seen in the backrooms of arenas with a poker table and later a framed doorway comically in the middle of the often large, open aired hallways, which they insisted anyone who came to speak to them use.

The Acolytes earned a shot at the WWF Tag Title at the Royal Rumble against the New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn), but lost the match. Their next shot at the title was at Fully Loaded when they faced Edge and Christian. The Acolytes won the match by disqualification but did not become champions. After unsuccessfully challenging for the tag title in 2000, APA won their third WWF Tag Team Championship on the July 9, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; by defeating the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). On the August 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, they lost the tag title to Alliance members Diamond Dallas Page and Chris Kanyon.

On the October 22 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Bradshaw defeated The Hurricane to win the WWF European Championship, his first singles title in the WWF. He lost the title to Christian on the November 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. At No Way Out in 2002, APA won a Tag Team Turmoil match and as a result, they challenged for the tag title at WrestleMania X8 along with Hardys and Dudleys, in a Four Corners Elimination match. The champions Billy and Chuck retained their title.

==== Singles competition (2002–2003) ====

Shortly after WrestleMania, Faarooq and Bradshaw split due to the brand extension. Bradshaw was drafted to Raw where his gimmick had an increased emphasis on his Texas roots, which included him carrying a cowbell to the ring and teaming up with fellow Texan Stone Cold Steve Austin. Bradshaw helped Austin in Austin&#x27;s feud against the nWo, teaming up with him against them and had a brief feud with Scott Hall where he faced Hall at Backlash on April 21 in a losing effort due to interference by X-Pac. Following Austin&#x27;s walkout on the WWE, Bradshaw joined the hardcore division and won the WWE Hardcore Championship seventeen times, with his first title win coming over Steven Richards on the June 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. He renamed the title the Texas Hardcore Championship. It was also during this time that his finishing move was briefly renamed from the &quot;Clothesline From Hell&quot; to the &quot;Clothesline From Texas&quot; or the &quot;Clothesline From Deep in the Heart of Texas.&quot; Jim Ross often called the move as such during his commentary, although the name eventually reverted to the original &quot;Clothesline From Hell.&quot;

In the hardcore division, Bradshaw feuded and exchanged the title with the likes of Richards, Shawn Stasiak, Raven, Christopher Nowinski, Big Show, Justin Credible, Johnny Stamboli, Crash Holly, Jeff Hardy, and Tommy Dreamer, before the title was unified by WWE Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam in August. In September, Bradshaw suffered a torn left biceps at a house show. He was out of action for six months until returning to Ohio Valley Wrestling and then a few weeks later to the active WWE roster.

==== APA reunion (2003–2004) ====
Bradshaw returned on the June 19, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which saw him and Faarooq saving the Undertaker from the hands of Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli, reuniting the APA in the process. Bradshaw returned with a new look, cutting his long hair, returning it to its natural color blonde, and going clean shaven. On the June 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the APA and the Undertaker defeated Stamboli, Palumbo and Nunzio. At Vengeance on July 27, Bradshaw won a bar room brawl match which featured Faarooq and a variety of mid-card superstars and other WWE employees. The duo lost to The Basham Brothers at No Mercy on October 19.

On the October 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the APA defeated Big Show and Brock Lesnar by disqualification after Lesnar attacked Faarooq with a steel chair. On the November 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Bradshaw defeated A-Train. At Survivor Series on November 16, Bradshaw was part of Kurt Angle&#x27;s team, as they faced Brock Lesnar&#x27;s team in a five-on-five tag team match. Bradshaw managed to eliminate A-Train, before he himself was eliminated by Big Show. His team eventually won the match. Bradshaw was defeated by A-Train on the November 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, ending their brief feud. At &quot;WWE Tribute to the Troops&quot; on December 25, the APA defeated The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team.

At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Bradshaw entered into the Royal Rumble match at entry number 5, but quickly was eliminated by Chris Benoit. At No Way Out on February 15, the APA faced the World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team in a losing effort. At WrestleMania XX on March 14, the APA unsuccessfully challenged for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a fatal four-way tag team match. The gimmick continued on-and-off until the March 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; until losing a tag team &quot;You&#x27;re Fired&quot; match to WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty for the tag team title. general manager Paul Heyman, frustrated by an insult by the APA, told Faarooq that if he did not win the aforementioned match, then &quot;You&#x27;re Fired.&quot; After the match, Bradshaw led Faarooq back to Heyman&#x27;s office to state they had not been fired, but had resigned. Then, Heyman cleared up the misunderstanding and pointed out that he said that if they did not win the titles, then he told Faarooq &quot;You&#x27;re fired.&quot; His reason for saying this directly to Faarooq was because it applied only to Faarooq because &quot;WWE Management&quot; still saw a lot of potential in Bradshaw. He left them after telling Bradshaw to think about his own future. Faarooq shouted after Heyman that he was not fired because they (Faarooq and Bradshaw) had quit. Bradshaw, however, hesitated. Faarooq took Bradshaw&#x27;s hesitation to mean that he would not resign, and so Faarooq promptly disbanded the APA and left. This turned Bradshaw heel. In reality, the WWE had decided to stop using Ron Simmons as an on-air performer due to health issues. He was initially released, but he was later re-hired to work behind the scenes in the WWE under various roles.

==== WWE Champion (2004–2005) ====
After the on air character of Faarooq disappeared from WWE television, Bradshaw proceeded to take on a J. R. Ewing esque gimmick, complete with a suit, cowboy hat, and tie. He began his first main event push as Kurt Angle and Big Show were injured and Brock Lesnar left the company, with someone needed to face the current WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero. He began referring to himself as John Bradshaw Layfield, or JBL. His finishing move&#x27;s name was part of the overhaul, becoming the &quot;Clothesline From Wall Street&quot; until he later changed it back to its original name. His first promo was on the border between Texas and Mexico, where he hunted for incoming illegal immigrants to win a &quot;Great American Award,&quot; which granted the winner number one contendership to the WWE Championship. He won, thanks to the then-SmackDown! general manager Kurt Angle, and immediately challenged Eddie Guerrero for the title.

At Judgment Day on May 16, he defeated Guerrero via disqualification in a match for the WWE Championship, but since a title cannot change hands by disqualification, Guerrero retained the title. JBL won his sole world championship, the WWE Championship from Guerrero in a Texas Bull Rope match at The Great American Bash on June 27. JBL won a rematch in a steel cage two weeks later on the July 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, again with Angle&#x27;s assistance.

After claiming he would not be defending the title at SummerSlam on August 15, The Undertaker challenged JBL for the title. Around this time, JBL hired Orlando Jordan to help him in title matches. At SummerSlam, JBL won the match by disqualification after The Undertaker hit him with the title belt. After the match, The Undertaker chokeslammed JBL through the roof of his limousine. While JBL wore a halo complete with his cowboy hat on top for the next few weeks to sell his &quot;injuries,&quot; SmackDown! general manager Theodore Long ultimately booked a Last Ride match for the title at No Mercy on October 3. JBL retained the title with some help from Heidenreich.

Though JBL held the title for many months, most title matches were won controversially. At Survivor Series on November 14, JBL defeated Booker T to retain his WWE Championship by hitting Booker T in the face with the title belt when the referee was knocked out. JBL defeated Eddie Guerrero, The Undertaker, and Booker T in a Fatal Four-Way at Armageddon on December 12 after a run-in by Heidenreich, who incapacitated The Undertaker, allowing JBL to take advantage and hit Booker T with the Clothesline From Hell to get the pinfall victory.
During JBL&#x27;s time as WWE Champion, he employed a stable named &quot;The Cabinet.&quot; At its peak, the stable contained Orlando Jordan, who was JBL&#x27;s &quot;Chief-of-Staff&quot; and Doug and Danny Basham, who were his &quot;Co-Secretaries of Defense&quot; until quitting the Cabinet on the June 16, 2005, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Amy Weber was also a member, being JBL&#x27;s image consultant, but later left WWE. WWE explained Weber&#x27;s absence by saying that JBL fired her after an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; taped in Japan. That episode saw Weber accidentally shoot JBL with a tranquilizer gun. Jordan is the only member not announced to have left the group, though mention of the term cabinet went on hiatus after SummerSlam and Orlando was released from WWE in May 2006.

JBL defended the title at the Royal Rumble on January 30, 2005 against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a Triple Threat match when he pinned Angle after the Clothesline From Hell and against Big Show in a Barbed Wire Steel Cage match at No Way Out on February 20, when Big Show chokeslammed JBL off the top rope through the ring and JBL later crawled out from under the ring apron, winning the match by escape. On the next episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, JBL had a &quot;Celebration of Excellence&quot; in which he and his Cabinet celebrated the fact that he was the longest-reigning WWE Champion in ten years, a party which was broken up and ruined by Big Show and newly crowned number one contender John Cena.

JBL lost the WWE Championship to John Cena at WrestleMania 21 on April 3. JBL&#x27;s unbroken nine-month reign was billed as the longest in a decade, lasting 280 days. On the April 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, JBL defeated Big Show, Booker T, and Kurt Angle in a fatal four-way elimination match to earn a rematch for the WWE Championship, but lost to Cena at Judgment Day on May 22 in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match.

On June 12, JBL appeared at the WWE-promoted ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view as an anti-ECW &quot;crusader.&quot; In the course of the night, he attacked The Blue Meanie in a shoot. WWE capitalized on the situation by resigning Meanie to a short-term contract. On the July 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Meanie was reunited with his old The Blue World Order associates Nova and Stevie Richards and he defeated JBL with the help of the World Heavyweight Champion Batista, who was drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; a few weeks after Cena was drafted to &quot;Raw&quot;. JBL and Batista then met in a match at The Great American Bash on July 24 for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL won the match by disqualification, after Batista hit JBL with a steel chair, but since a title does not change hands by disqualification, Batista retained the title. At SummerSlam on August 21, Batista defeated JBL in a No Holds Barred match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL lost another rematch with Batista on the September 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a Texas Bullrope match, ending the feud.

==== United States Champion (2005–2006) ====

On the September 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, JBL lost to Rey Mysterio. He hired Jillian Hall to &quot;fix&quot; his career. At No Mercy on October 9, JBL defeated Mysterio in a rematch. JBL started a feud with The Boogeyman who scared him many times. The two had a match at the Royal Rumble on January 29, 2006, which the Boogeyman won. His next opponent was Bobby Lashley, whom JBL defeated at No Way Out on February 19. On the February 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he suffered a broken hand at the hands of Chris Benoit in a six-man tag team match, and WWE.com announced that he underwent successful surgery. JBL returned and feuded with Benoit, defeating him for his United States Championship at WrestleMania 22 on April 2. During this time, Jillian Hall remained at the side of JBL until the April 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when JBL fired Hall, due to a mistake she made during a steel cage rematch between JBL and Benoit the week before as well as her lack of putting together an &quot;appropriate&quot; celebration for him.

JBL, while still United States Champion, challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL tried to weaken then champion Rey Mysterio in the weeks leading up to his title match as Mysterio faced off against any opponent of JBL&#x27;s choosing, capitalizing on Mysterio claiming that he was &quot;a man of his word,&quot; and would take on anyone. Mysterio was defeated by Mark Henry and squashed by The Great Khali in non-title singles matches before facing Raw&#x27;s Kane in a match, that went to a no-contest. This was leading to their title match at Judgment Day on May 21, which Mysterio won and retained the title by pinning JBL after a frog splash. On the May 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mysterio turned the tables on JBL, making him take on Bobby Lashley with the United States Championship on the line, and JBL lost the title. Infuriated, JBL went to SmackDown! general manager Theodore Long, telling Long that he wanted a rematch with Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship and that if JBL lost, he would quit. When he lost, the crowd at the arena began to sing &quot;Na Na, Hey Hey, Goodbye&quot;. JBL later stated that he did not have a formal contract with Long going into the match and that he did not intend to leave &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. This angle was used to give JBL time off wrestling due to his serious back injury.

==== Commentator and part-time wrestler (2006–2008) ====
At ECW One Night Stand on June 11, JBL announced that he would take Tazz&#x27;s place as the new color commentator for &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He made his debut as a color commentator on the June 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. JBL noted in a commentary on TheStreet.com that he was retiring from in-ring competition for good. In his final column on the website, JBL wrote, &quot;I have also come to believe that you can&#x27;t fight father time. A broken back suffered in a match in England, compounded by a herniated and bulged disc, finally made me realize my career as a professional wrestler was over. I since migrated to the color commentary position much in the way that Jesse Ventura did before me.&quot;

JBL returned to the ring on November 13 in the main event of a WWE house show in Dublin, Ireland. JBL teamed with Mr. Kennedy and King Booker against The Brothers of Destruction (Kane and The Undertaker), and Batista. On the December 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, JBL cut a promo berating Theodore Long and cursing out the fans for cheering during the Inferno match at Armageddon on December 17 (&quot;Rome didn&#x27;t fall because of the gladiators in the ring. Rome fell because of the spectators in the stands.&quot;)

On the October 12, 2007, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, JBL was announced as one of the options WWE fans would be able to vote for to be the special guest referee at Cyber Sunday on October 28 for the World Heavyweight Championship match between Batista and The Undertaker, but he lost the vote to Stone Cold Steve Austin. At Cyber Sunday, he issued a heated altercation towards those running alongside him, ultimately receiving a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin. After this, he became physical as a color commentator, attacking both Batista and The Undertaker in the middle of a match as revenge after he was speared by Batista and later chokeslammed by The Undertaker after taunting them consecutively, in events leading up to Cyber Sunday. He justified these actions by explaining, &quot;I am retired, not dead&quot; (and that he [Layfield] should be respected).

At Armageddon on December 16, JBL was present at the SmackDown! announcer&#x27;s table during the WWE Championship match. During this match, Randy Orton whipped a charging Chris Jericho over the announcer table where JBL was situated, and in the heat of the match, Jericho &quot;pushed&quot; JBL out of the way. Minutes later, an infuriated JBL kicked Jericho in the head, leading to a disqualification victory for Jericho meaning that Orton retained the title.
On the December 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, JBL announced that he would resume his wrestling career in response to a challenge made by Jericho. On the December 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, JBL gave his farewell address from SmackDown!, officially marking his return to Raw on December 31. Jericho was disqualified in their match at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2008 after hitting JBL with a chair. The duo battled in a rematch on the February 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which Jericho won.

On February 18 on &quot;Raw&quot;, JBL interfered in the scheduled steel cage match between Mr. McMahon and his storyline illegitimate son, Hornswoggle. After Vince whipped Hornswoggle with his belt, JBL attacked Finlay from behind and handcuffed him to the top rope. After Mr. McMahon left the ring, JBL proceeded to beat Hornswoggle throwing him against the sides of the cage. JBL later revealed to McMahon that Hornswoggle was Finlay&#x27;s storyline son, not McMahon&#x27;s. On March 29, JBL inducted the Brisco Brothers into the WWE Hall of Fame. On March 30, JBL defeated Finlay in a Belfast Brawl at WrestleMania XXIV.

JBL&#x27;s first championship bid since returning to the ring came by challenging Randy Orton for the WWE Championship and participating in a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match at Backlash on April 27 that also included John Cena and Triple H. JBL was eliminated first in the match by tapping out to Cena&#x27;s STFU, thus renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL at Judgment Day on May 18 and then at One Night Stand on June 1 in a First Blood match. He managed to defeat Cena in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash on July 20.

==== Intercontinental Champion and retirement (2008–2009) ====

JBL&#x27;s next on-screen rivalry was with CM Punk, the reigning World Heavyweight Champion. During the feud, JBL insulted Punk&#x27;s straight-edge lifestyle, calling it &quot;boring.&quot; On the August 11 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, JBL challenged Punk to a contest he claimed that Punk would not be able to win, which was revealed to be an alcohol drinking contest where he challenged Punk to drink a shot of Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey to prove that he would do anything to remain champion. Punk refused, not wanting to risk compromising his beliefs, before throwing the drink in JBL&#x27;s face. JBL faced Punk for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam on August 17, which he would lose after Punk hit him with his finishing move, the Go 2 Sleep. On September 7 at Unforgiven, JBL faced Batista, Kane, Rey Mysterio and Chris Jericho (who replaced Punk in the match after he was attacked by Randy Orton) in a Championship Scramble match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Jericho went on to win the match and the World Heavyweight Championship. At No Mercy on October 5, JBL was defeated by Batista in a No. 1 Contender&#x27;s match for the World Heavyweight Championship.

Throughout late 2008 and early 2009, JBL had a short rivalry with Shawn Michaels. At Survivor Series on November 23, JBL&#x27;s team faced Michaels&#x27; team in a five on five tag team elimination tag team match in which Michaels&#x27; team emerged victorious. Michaels had lost his family&#x27;s personal savings due to the global financial crisis and would later become JBL&#x27;s employee at Armageddon on December 14. After failing to secure JBL for the World Heavyweight Championship against John Cena at the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2009, Michaels agreed to take part in an &quot;All or Nothing&quot; match at No Way Out on February 15. Michaels won the match at No Way Out, after his wife (who was watching in the audience) punched JBL in the face and Michaels planted the Sweet Chin Music. This ended any employment links between the two with Michaels still receiving the full payment owed to him and end the feud.

On the March 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, JBL defeated CM Punk to win the Intercontinental Championship, thus becoming the tenth Grand Slam Champion and twentieth Triple Crown Champion. He held the title for one month, losing the Intercontinental title at WrestleMania 25 on April 5 against Rey Mysterio in 21 seconds. After the match, he grabbed a microphone and said &quot;I quit!&quot;; the next day he announced his retirement on his WWE Universe blog.

==== Return to commentating (2011–2017) ====
Layfield made his return to WWE on the March 7, 2011, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as Michael Cole&#x27;s choice for special guest referee for his match against Jerry Lawler at WrestleMania XXVII on April 3. He cut a promo claiming he was starting his &quot;journey back to the main event at WrestleMania,&quot; before being interrupted by Stone Cold Steve Austin just as he was about to sign the contract. After a brief argument between the two, Austin hit Layfield with the &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; and signed the contract to be the special guest referee.

On March 31, 2012, Layfield inducted his former tag team partner and real life best friend Ron Simmons into the 2012 WWE Hall of Fame. On July 23 Layfield returned with Simmons at &quot;Raw 1000&quot; as the APA, after being called for protection by Lita. After a &quot;Clothesline from Hell&quot;, Lita defeated Heath Slater, thus turning face for the first time since 2004.
Starting at Night of Champions on September 16, Layfield returned to his JBL persona, and sporadically filled in as color commentator, replacing Jerry Lawler, who suffered a legitimate heart attack during the &quot;Raw&quot; episode preceding Night of Champions. Layfield later re-signed with WWE and returned to the &quot;SmackDown&quot; broadcast team on a full-time basis, alongside Josh Mathews and eventually Michael Cole. On April 1, 2013, JBL became the third commentator for &quot;Raw&quot; alongside Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler. JBL was also part of the commentary team at WWE pay-per-views and commentated at WrestleMania 29 on April 7. On September 12, JBL was named commissioner of NXT, replacing Dusty Rhodes. On January 26, 2014, at the Royal Rumble, JBL wrestled in his first WWE match in nearly five years as a surprise entrant in the Royal Rumble match. Having been on commentary the whole broadcast, JBL left the commentator&#x27;s table when his number (#24) came up. However, JBL was quickly eliminated by Roman Reigns while trying to hand his jacket to Michael Cole and resumed his role as commentator for the rest of the broadcast. In July, JBL was retired as &quot;NXT&quot; general manager and succeeded by William Regal. On the January 19, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, JBL, along with Ron Simmons (a fellow member of The Acolytes Protection Agency), the New World Order and The New Age Outlaws attacked The Ascension and then, JBL would perform a &quot;Clothesline from Hell&quot; on Viktor. On the March 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, JBL, along with Booker T and Michael Cole, were injured by Brock Lesnar after Seth Rollins refused Lesnar his WWE World Heavyweight Championship rematch.

Following the 2016 WWE draft on July 19, WWE announced on their website that JBL would move to the &quot;SmackDown&quot; commentary team, joining Mauro Ranallo and David Otunga. Layfield returned to his alma mater, Abilene Christian University, a color commentator for two radio broadcasts as the ACU football team faced Houston Baptist University and Stephen F. Austin State University in September 2016. He made his first appearance on the American Sports Network on October 1, 2016, when ACU hosted the University of Central Arkansas. On the January 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, JBL saved Jerry Lawler, after Lawler&#x27;s interview with Dolph Ziggler, who took credit for Lawler&#x27;s real-life heart attack in September 2012, before Ziggler viciously kicked Lawler&#x27;s chest and left the ring.

==== Sporadic appearances and WWE Hall of Famer (2017–present) ====
On September 1, 2017, JBL announced that he was stepping away from the SmackDown Live commentary team to focus on humanitarian work in and out of WWE, mainly as a Beyond Sport Global Ambassador. The APA made an appearance at the &quot;Raw 25 Years&quot; show on January 22, 2018, playing poker with other legends and superstars. Layfield occasionally works on commentary during the Tribute to the Troops events with the latest one occurred on December 4, 2018 (aired on December 20) in Fort Hood.

On March 3, 2020, during &quot;WWE Backstage&quot; it was officially announced that JBL would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of WrestleMania 36 week however the event was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 22, 2020, he made an appearance at Survivor Series during The Undertaker&#x27;s retirement ceremony. During WrestleMania 37 week, JBL was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2020 during the 2021 ceremony following the delay the previous year, he was later a panelist on the WrestleMania 37 kick-off show, and provided commentary in the singles match between Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn.

From October 2022 until February 2023, Layfield worked as the manager of Baron Corbin.

On the November 21, 2023, episode of NXT, JBL announced who will be in the qualifiers for the Iron Survivor Challenge at NXT Deadline.

On December 8, 2023, JBL served as a guest commentator for the 21st annual Tribute to the Troops episode on SmackDown.

On the January 20, 2025, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, JBL served as the guest commentator for the match between Rey Mysterio and Kofi Kingston.

=== Non-WWE appearances (2024–present) ===
Layfield, in his first non-WWE appearance since 1995, as John Layfield, accompanied Nic Nemeth (formerly Dolph Ziggler) to the ring at Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide&#x27;s Triplemanía XXXII: Mexico City event on August 17, 2024, to defend the AAA Mega Championship, in which Nemeth lost to Alberto El Patrón. During the following weeks, Layfield also appeared at Game Changer Wrestling&#x27;s Homecoming and Dream On Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s Emergence, Bound for Glory and Genesis, Major League Wrestling&#x27;s Fightland., and Juggalo Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Devil&#x27;s Night

==Business career==
WWE describes Layfield as a &quot;self-made&quot; millionaire. In 2003, Layfield published a book on financial management titled &quot;Have More Money Now&quot;. He and his wife, then Oppenheimer Holdings&#x27; financial analyst Meredith Whitney, were featured in the August 2008 issue of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine.

Layfield is the founder of Layfield Energy. In 2008, Layfield Energy launched a drink called MamaJuana Energy. In March 2009, Layfield Energy became the main sponsor and advertiser of Ohio Valley Wrestling, a former WWE developmental promotion based in Louisville, Kentucky.

Layfield has lived full-time in Bermuda since shortly after his retirement from in-ring activity. Feeling confined living in New York City, he spent the summer of 2009 in Bermuda at his wife&#x27;s encouragement, and the couple soon bought a full-time home there. As he acclimated to Bermuda, he noticed what he called &quot;the almost predominant black-on-black violence that is unfortunately pervasive throughout the local neighborhoods&quot;, and in 2011 created the nonprofit organization Beyond Rugby Bermuda, using rugby union to provide young people with an alternative to gangs. The organization is an offshoot of Beyond Sport, a South African nonprofit that uses running for similar purposes; Layfield was introduced to that group&#x27;s founder when he and his wife visited the country for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He spends much of his time outside of WWE with the organization, filling duties as varied as celebrity fundraising and mowing the rugby field. Beyond Rugby Bermuda began with six boys; as of February 2017, more than 400 boys and girls were involved. Layfield is now a global ambassador for Beyond Sport alongside figures such as Tony Blair and Desmond Tutu.

In the spring of 2018, Major League Rugby announced that they would start an expansion team in New York City. In this announcement, it was announced that the co-founders of the Rugby New York club would be James Kennedy and Layfield.

== Cable news ==
In 2004, Layfield was hired by CNBC to be a contributor. During a WWE house show in Munich, Germany, early in June 2004, in an attempt to draw heel heat, he gave the crowd several Nazi salutes while goose-stepping around the ring. Such a display is illegal in Germany, and CNBC fired Layfield as a result of the controversy. In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Layfield explained &quot;I&#x27;m a bad guy [on WWE TV]. I&#x27;m supposed to incite the crowd. I&#x27;ve done it for decades. I really didn&#x27;t think anything of [the Nazi salute] – I know how bad it is, I&#x27;ve lived [in Germany]. I&#x27;ve been to Dachau, seen those places where they exterminated millions of Jews. I draw the line between me and my character. That&#x27;s like saying Anthony Hopkins (who portrays Hannibal Lecter) really enjoys cannibalism.&quot;

Layfield left CNBC and was subsequently hired by Fox News and sister network (and CNBC rival) Fox Business as a business commentator.

==Other media==
In April 2009, following his departure from WWE, Ohio Valley Wrestling owner Danny Davis announced in a press release that Layfield would be color commentator and host for &quot;Vyper Fight League&quot;, which Layfield would also sponsor with Layfield Energy; however, the company folded the following year.

In November 2012, Layfield started hosting a new show on WWE&#x27;s YouTube channel alongside Michael Cole and Renee Young called &quot;The JBL and Renee Show&quot; (formerly known as &quot;The JBL Show&quot; and &quot;The JBL and Cole Show)&quot;. The series ended in May 2015.

Layfield used to run the website Layfield Report which highlighted a variety of his views and opinions in numerous articles. The site was ended in September 2014.

Layfield has appeared as a playable character in a number of WWE video games. His first appearance as a playable character was in &quot;WWF Attitude&quot;, with his latest appearance in &quot;WWE 2K22&quot;, as well as being a playable character, in &quot;WWF WrestleMania 2000&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, &quot;WWF No Mercy&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It&quot;, &quot;WWF Road to WrestleMania&quot;, &quot;WWF Raw&quot;, &quot;WWE WrestleMania X8&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;, &quot;WWE Crush Hour&quot;, &quot;WWE Raw 2&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot;, &quot;WWE WrestleMania 21&quot;, &quot;WWE Day of Reckoning 2&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010&quot;, &quot;WWE &#x27;13&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K15&quot; as DLC, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K18&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K22&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K23&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot; Layfield also appears as a commentator for several games, including &quot;WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2008&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;.

Layfield began broadcasting American football games in 2016, serving as analyst for a pair of Abilene Christian University radio broadcasts and two Southland Conference games televised on American Sports Network. His ASN debut pitted the University of Central Arkansas against Abilene Christian, followed by ACU&#x27;s matchup at McNeese State University.

In 2021, Layfield began hosting a podcast series with Gerald Brisco.

=== Filmography ===
== Personal life ==
His parents are Lavelle Layfield, who is a minister, and Mary Layfield.

Layfield married his second wife, Meredith Whitney, on February 11, 2005, in Key West, Florida. He was previously married to Cindy Womack on June 6, 1994, but divorced in 2003.

===Bullying allegations and hazing===
&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; has said that Layfield &quot;has been accused for years of being a locker room bully,&quot; while &quot;Deadspin&quot; wrote that &quot;backstage tales of Layfield&#x27;s hazing and bullying have long been legend among hardcore wrestling fans.&quot; &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; described that &quot;YouTube has dozens of interviews where former performers discuss harassment, bullying and taking real blows from Layfield while wrestling him in supposedly choreographed matches.&quot; &quot;Le Journal de Montréal&quot; listed Mark Henry, Matt Hardy, René Duprée, Daivari, and Ivory, among others, as wrestlers who in interviews described Layfield as a bully. In 2010, The Miz referenced Layfield in an onscreen promo about hazing he faced in the locker room early in his career. Layfield admitted to hazing Miz and said that he did not regret doing so.

In April 2017, WWE commentator Mauro Ranallo took an absence from WWE, which Dave Meltzer reported had been triggered by hostilities with Layfield. The allegations coincided with the release of former WWE ring announcer Justin Roberts&#x27; autobiography, in which he alleged that Layfield stole his passport. Layfield denied that he himself stole the passport, but John Morrison subsequently claimed that Layfield encouraged him and Joey Mercury to steal Roberts&#x27; passport, which they did not agree to. Angered WWE fans subsequently called on WWE to fire Layfield. On April 22, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that Ranallo and WWE &quot;mutually agreed to part ways,&quot; and Ranallo released a statement in which he said his departure had &quot;nothing to do with JBL.&quot; Layfield released a statement of his own, stating: &quot;Admittedly, I took part in locker room pranks that existed within the industry years ago. WWE addressed my behavior and I responded accordingly, yet my past is being brought up because of recent unfounded rumors. I apologize if anything I said playing &#x27;the bad guy&#x27; on a TV show was misconstrued.&quot;

<text>Christian Kramp (8 July 1760 – 13 May 1826) was a French mathematician, who worked primarily with factorials.
Christian Kramp&#x27;s father was his teacher at grammar school in Strasbourg. Kramp studied medicine and graduated; however, his interests certainly ranged outside medicine, for in addition to a number of medical publications he published a work on crystallography in 1793. In 1795, France annexed the Rhineland area in which Kramp was carrying out his work and after this he became a teacher at Cologne (this city was French from 1794 to 1815), teaching mathematics, chemistry, and physics. Kramp could read and write in German and French.

Kramp was appointed professor of mathematics at Strasbourg, the town of his birth, in 1809. He was elected to the geometry section of the French Academy of Sciences in 1817. As Bessel, Legendre and Gauss did, Kramp worked on the generalised factorial function which applied to non-integers. His work on factorials is independent of that of James Stirling and Vandermonde. He was the first to use the notation &quot;n&quot;! (&quot;Elements d&#x27;arithmétique universelle&quot;, 1808). In fact, the more general concept of factorial was found at the same time by Arbogast.

&quot;Kramp&#x27;s function&quot;, a scaled complex error function, is today better known as the Faddeeva function.

<text>was a Japanese writer of short stories and novels.

==Biography==
Born in the Daikancho quarter of Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, Ishizaka entered Keio University in 1919. Upon graduating from the Faculty of Letters, he took a position at Hirosaki Girls&#x27; High School. Later, he became a teacher at Akita Prefectural Yokote Girls&#x27; High School and Akita Prefectural Yokote Junior High School.

In 1939, he moved to Tokyo to concentrate on his literary work. During World War II, he served as a war correspondent in the Philippines.

His 1947 novel &quot;Blue Mountain Range&quot; (青い山脈, &quot;Aoi sanmyaku&quot;) portrayed the emancipated post-war youth through the relationships of a group of high school students.

While widely popular in Japan, with his writings repeatedly made into films, only a small portion of his writings have been translated and published in English.

<doc id="308411" wikidata="Q1891986" url="?curid=308411" title="Tuned mass damper">
<text>A tuned mass damper (TMD), also known as a harmonic absorber or seismic damper, is a device mounted in structures to reduce mechanical vibrations, consisting of a mass mounted on one or more damped springs. Its oscillation frequency is tuned to be similar to the resonant frequency of the object it is mounted to, and reduces the object&#x27;s maximum amplitude while weighing much less than it.

TMDs can prevent discomfort, damage, or outright structural failure. They are frequently used in power transmission, automobiles and buildings.

==Principle==

Tuned mass dampers stabilize against violent motion caused by harmonic vibration. They use a comparatively lightweight component to reduce the vibration of a system so that its worst-case vibrations are less intense. Roughly speaking, practical systems are tuned to either move the main mode away from a troubling excitation frequency, or to add damping to a resonance that is difficult or expensive to damp directly. An example of the latter is a crankshaft torsional damper. Mass dampers are frequently implemented with a frictional or hydraulic component that turns mechanical kinetic energy into heat, like an automotive shock absorber.

Given a motor with mass &quot;m&quot;1 attached via motor mounts to the ground, the motor vibrates as it operates and the soft motor mounts act as a parallel spring and damper, &quot;k&quot;1 and &quot;c&quot;1. The force on the motor mounts is &quot;F&quot;0. In order to reduce the maximum force on the motor mounts as the motor operates over a range of speeds, a smaller mass, &quot;m&quot;2, is connected to &quot;m&quot;1 by a spring and a damper, &quot;k&quot;2 and &quot;c&quot;2. &quot;F&quot;1 is the effective force on the motor due to its operation.

The graph shows the effect of a tuned mass damper on a simple spring–mass–damper system, excited by vibrations with an amplitude of one unit of force applied to the main mass, &quot;m&quot;1. An important measure of performance is the ratio of the force on the motor mounts to the force vibrating the motor, . This assumes that the system is linear, so if the force on the motor were to double, so would the force on the motor mounts. The blue line represents the baseline system, with a maximum response of 9 units of force at around 9 units of frequency. The red line shows the effect of adding a tuned mass of 10% of the baseline mass. It has a maximum response of 5.5, at a frequency of 7. As a side effect, it also has a second normal mode and will vibrate somewhat more than the baseline system at frequencies below about 6 and above about 10. 

The heights of the two peaks can be adjusted by changing the stiffness of the spring in the tuned mass damper. Changing the damping also changes the height of the peaks, in a complex fashion. The split between the two peaks can be changed by altering the mass of the damper (&quot;m&quot;2).
The Bode plot is more complex, showing the phase and magnitude of the motion of each mass, for the two cases, relative to &quot;F&quot;1.

In the plots at right, the black line shows the baseline response (&quot;m&quot;2 = 0). Now considering &quot;m&quot;2 = , the blue line shows the motion of the damping mass and the red line shows the motion of the primary mass. The amplitude plot shows that at low frequencies, the damping mass resonates much more than the primary mass. The phase plot shows that at low frequencies, the two masses are in phase. As the frequency increases &quot;m&quot;2 moves out of phase with &quot;m&quot;1 until at around 9.5 Hz it is 180° out of phase with &quot;m&quot;1, maximizing the damping effect by maximizing the amplitude of &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;x&quot;1, this maximizes the energy dissipated into &quot;c&quot;2 and simultaneously pulls on the primary mass in the same direction as the motor mounts.

==Mass dampers in automobiles==
===Motorsport===
The tuned mass damper was introduced as part of the suspension system by Renault on its 2005 F1 car (the Renault R25), at the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix. The system reportedly reduced lap times by 0.3 seconds: a phenomenal gain for a relatively simple device. The stewards of the meeting deemed it legal, but the FIA appealed against that decision.

Two weeks later, the FIA International Court of Appeal deemed the mass damper illegal. It was deemed to be illegal because the mass was not rigidly attached to the chassis; the influence the damper had on the pitch attitude of the car in turn affected the gap under the car and the ground effects of the car. As such, the damper was considered to be a movable aerodynamic device and hence an illegal influence on the performance of the aerodynamics.

===Production cars===
Tuned mass dampers are widely used in production cars, typically on the crankshaft pulley to control torsional vibration and, more rarely, the bending modes of the crankshaft. They are also used on the driveline for gearwhine, and elsewhere for other noises or vibrations on the exhaust, body, suspension or anywhere else. Almost all modern cars will have one mass damper, and some may have ten or more.

The usual design of damper on the crankshaft consists of a thin band of rubber between the hub of the pulley and the outer rim. This device, often called a harmonic damper, is located on the other end of the crankshaft opposite of where the flywheel and the transmission are. An alternative design is the centrifugal pendulum absorber which is used to reduce the internal combustion engine&#x27;s torsional vibrations.

All four wheels of the Citroën 2CV incorporated a tuned mass damper (referred to as a in the original French) of very similar design to that used in the Renault F1 car, from the start of production in 1949 on all four wheels, before being removed from the rear and eventually the front wheels in the mid 1970s.

== Mass dampers in bridges ==

The tuned mass damper is widely used as a method to add damping to bridges. One use case for tuned mass dampers in bridges is to prevent large vibrations due to resonance with pedestrian loads. By adding a tuned mass damper, damping is added to the structure which causes the vibration of the structure to be reduced as the vibration steady state amplitude is inversely proportional to the damping of the structure.

==Mass dampers in spacecraft==
One proposal to reduce vibration on NASA&#x27;s Ares solid fuel booster was to use 16 tuned mass dampers as part of a design strategy to reduce peak loads from 6&quot;g&quot; to 0.25&quot;g&quot;, with the TMDs being responsible for the reduction from 1&quot;g&quot; to 0.25&quot;g&quot;, the rest being done by conventional vibration isolators between the upper stages and the booster.

==Dampers in power transmission lines==

High-tension lines often have small barbell-shaped Stockbridge dampers hanging from the wires to reduce the high-frequency, low-amplitude oscillation termed flutter.

==Dampers in wind turbines==
A standard tuned mass damper for wind turbines consists of an auxiliary mass which is attached to the main structure by means of springs and dashpot elements. The natural frequency of the tuned mass damper is basically defined by its spring constant and the damping ratio determined by the dashpot. The tuned parameter of the tuned mass damper enables the auxiliary mass to oscillate with a phase shift with respect to the motion of the structure. In a typical configuration, an auxiliary mass hung below the nacelle of a wind turbine supported by dampers or friction plates.

==Dampers in buildings and related structures==
When installed in buildings, dampers are typically huge concrete blocks or steel bodies mounted in skyscrapers or other structures, which move in opposition to the resonance frequency oscillations of the structure by means of springs, fluid, or pendulums.

===Sources of vibration and resonance===
Unwanted vibration may be caused by environmental forces acting on a structure, such as wind or earthquake, or by a seemingly innocuous vibration source causing resonance that may be destructive, unpleasant or simply inconvenient.

====Earthquakes====
The seismic waves caused by an earthquake will make buildings sway and oscillate in various ways depending on the frequency and direction of ground motion, and the height and construction of the building. Seismic activity can cause excessive oscillations of the building which may lead to structural failure. To enhance the building&#x27;s seismic performance, a proper building design is performed engaging various seismic vibration control technologies.
As mentioned above, damping devices had been used in the aeronautics and automobile industries long before they were standard in mitigating seismic damage to buildings. In fact, the first specialized damping devices for earthquakes were not developed until late in 1950.

====Mechanical human sources====

Masses of people walking up and down stairs at once, or great numbers of people stomping in unison, can cause serious problems in large structures like stadiums if those structures lack damping measures.

====Wind====
The force of wind against tall buildings can cause the top of skyscrapers to move more than a meter. This motion can be in the form of swaying or twisting, and can cause the upper floors of such buildings to move. Certain angles of wind and aerodynamic properties of a building can accentuate the movement and cause motion sickness in people. A TMD is usually tuned to its building&#x27;s resonant frequency to work efficiently. However, during their lifetimes, high-rise and slender buildings may experience natural resonant frequency changes under wind speed, ambient temperature and relative humidity variations, among other factors, which requires a robust TMD design.

===Examples of buildings and structures with tuned mass dampers===

<text>This is a list of notable soups. Soups have been made since ancient times.

Some soups are served with large chunks of meat or vegetables left in the liquid, while others are served as a broth. A broth is a flavored liquid usually derived from boiling a type of meat with bone, a spice mix, or a vegetable mix for a period of time in a stock.

A potage is a category of thick soups, stews, or porridges, in some of which meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they form a thick mush.

Bisques are heavy cream soups traditionally prepared with shellfish, but can be made with any type of seafood or other base ingredients. Cream soups are dairy based soups. Although they may be consumed on their own, or with a meal, the canned, condensed form of cream soup is sometimes used as a quick sauce in a variety of meat and pasta convenience food dishes, such as casseroles. Similar to bisques, chowders are thick soups usually containing some type of starch.

Coulis were originally meat juices, and now are thick purées.

While soups are usually heated, some soups are served only cold and other soups can optionally be served cold.

<doc id="308418" wikidata="Q953153" url="?curid=308418" title="Dennis Miller">
<text>Dennis Michael Miller (born November 3, 1953) is an American political commentator, stand-up comedian, talk show host, writer, actor and former sportscaster.

Miller was a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1985 to 1991, and he subsequently hosted a string of his own talk shows on HBO, CNBC, and also in syndication. From 2007 to 2015, Miller hosted a daily, three-hour, self-titled talk radio program, nationally syndicated by Westwood One. On March 9, 2020, &quot;Dennis Miller + One&quot; show, launched on RT America. It ran twice-weekly and featured celebrity interviews.

Miller is listed as 21st on Comedy Central&#x27;s 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, and he was ranked as the best host of &quot;SNL&quot;″s &quot;Weekend Update&quot; by &quot;Vulture&quot;.
==Early life==
Miller was born in Pittsburgh and grew up in the suburb of Castle Shannon. He is of Scottish descent. Miller&#x27;s parents separated and he was raised by his mother, Norma who was a dietitian at a Baptist nursing home. Miller is reluctant to speak about his father, usually just saying he &quot;moved on when I was very young.&quot; He is the oldest of five children.

Miller attended Saint Anne School, a Catholic elementary school. At St. Anne&#x27;s, he managed the Catholic Youth Organization basketball team for boys 15–16 years old.

His first inspiration to pursue a comedy career came when as a child he was taken to see comedian Kelly Monteith at a Pittsburgh club. After the show, Monteith was kind enough to answer the young Miller&#x27;s questions about being a comedian. Two other early influences were Jonathan Winters and Tim Conway.

Miller went to Keystone Oaks High School. At Keystone Oaks, Miller was a member of the Physical Fitness Club, and in his senior year he worked on the Keynote newspaper and served on the student council, but lost his bid for senior class president.

By high school, he had already developed a reputation for humor. Despite this, his actual personality at this time was one that was reserved, lacking self-confidence, and hidden under a layer of comedy. He graduated from high school in 1971 with the intent of studying to become a sports writer.

===College and odd jobs===

At Point Park University Miller became a member of Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity. Miller likened his social status at this period as being lower than Booger of &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;. Miller majored in journalism. In the fall of his senior year at the university, he began writing for the &quot;South Hills Record&quot;, mixing humor into his sports reporting. When the paper changed its payment structure to pay around an eighth of a penny per column inch, he quit. He graduated from Point Park in 1976 with a degree in journalism. He later reflected, &quot;I&#x27;m just not that interested in other people&#x27;s business and that&#x27;s a tragic flaw in a journalist.&quot;

After college Miller moved through several occupations, including a clerk at Giant Eagle deli, a janitor, a delivery man for a florist, and an ice cream scooper at the Village Dairy. As an ice-cream scooper, Miller recalled that he was twenty-one, five years out of high school, and wearing a paper hat while working alongside teenagers. A spur to quit the ice cream scooping job was when he took the order of the prettiest girl from his high school, which filled him with embarrassment. Miller later said that at the time he feared that if he stayed in such jobs, his life would become a Franz Kafka novella, and it stiffened his resolve to start pursuing a comedy career.

Leaving the ice cream parlor Miller joined the staff at Point Park&#x27;s Recreation Room, where he was in charge of the bowling alley, video games, and running the air-hockey league. A patron from that time recalled that Miller sat on pool tables telling jokes and honing his comedy to those in the rec room, which was the only place the commuters gathered. Miller and the other patrons closely followed the NFL at the time as it was the &quot;era of the Super Steelers&quot;.

==Stand-up==
In 1979, after seeing a Robin Williams comedy special on HBO, Miller began to pursue his dream of being a stand-up comedian.

===Pittsburgh===

In Pittsburgh, Miller began a comedy career by performing at open-mic nights. He backed out of his first two attempts to perform at an open mic due to stage fright and anger with himself over the question of whether the drive to perform was a need for approval from others. When he finally made his début at the Oak&#x27;s Lounge on Sleepy Hollow Road in Castle Shannon, most of Miller&#x27;s family was in the audience to cheer him on.

He began appearing onstage at the Oak&#x27;s Lounge in Castle Shannon while working at the Giant Eagle deli in Kennedy. Miller lived without a car and without much money in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, hitching rides or taking buses.

===New York City===

He continued to do stand-up in Oakland and at places like Brandy&#x27;s in the Strip District and the Portfolio on Craig Street, eventually saving up $1,000 which he used to try to fast-track his comedy career by moving to New York City. Once there, Miller had to bribe a landlord to give him a room for $200, then had to pay the security deposit of $250 and the first month&#x27;s rent of $250. Thus, he spent $700 of his $1,000 savings on his first day in New York, for a sparse, bunker-like room.

While in New York he submitted a joke for a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine contest for humor writing that was judged by an all-star panel including Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Cosby, David Brenner, Martin Mull, Art Buchwald, and Buck Henry. Of around 15,000 entries, Miller tied for second and his joke and picture appeared in the June 1979 issue of the magazine. Miller won $500 in &quot;Playboy&quot;″s first annual humor competition with the following joke:
Miller gained more exposure when he tried out for the New York Laff-Off Contest. The contest had 40 slots but 32 of them had already been filled by the top regulars who appeared at the three comedy venues sponsoring the competition. Many of the 350 comedians Miller was up against had hours of crafted material, while he had fine-tuned around ten minutes. To his surprise and delight, Miller earned one of the remaining slots. For the competition itself he appeared at the Improv and received a standing ovation, moving him on to the finals. While he lost the Laff-Off, he was seen by dozens of talent agents, resulting in bookings at colleges and other clubs.

While he was working in New York City, &quot;Hustler Magazine&quot; listed Miller in a piece called &quot;The 10 Funniest People in America You&#x27;ll Never See on TV&quot;. During this time, Miller supported himself by working day jobs such as bartender and payroll clerk, and by night made the rounds of New York clubs The Comic Strip, The Improvisation, and Catch a Rising Star.

===Return to Pittsburgh and KDKA-TV===

After about a year in New York City, he returned to Pittsburgh. It was there that local television station KDKA-TV was shooting a piece for its &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; and offered him a job at the station. By the end of 1980 Miller was acting as a warm-up in the afternoons for KDKA&#x27;s &quot;Pittsburgh 2Day&quot;. He then began starring in humorous segments for the syndicated &quot;Evening Magazine&quot;. By 1983 he had become the host of &quot;Punchline,&quot; a Saturday-morning newsmagazine aimed at teenagers. In one episode he interviewed fellow comedian Pat Paulsen. Miller later reflected on this time, saying that &quot;you have to start somewhere,&quot; and that he was &quot;just pleased to be in front of a camera.&quot;

During performances at comedy clubs in Pittsburgh, Miller befriended Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld. In 1984 Leno found Miller an apartment in Los Angeles and he and Seinfeld arranged a debut for Miller at The Improv. Miller resigned from KDKA and moved to Los Angeles to try to further his comedy career.

===Los Angeles===

Miller&#x27;s brothers Rich and Jimmy joined him in Los Angeles, taking up varied jobs around The Improv such as booking shows, acting as a bouncer, and selling tickets. Jimmy became a power talent agent with Gold Miller, and Rich ran RCM Entertainment, booking comedians across the country.

In Los Angeles, Leno was a big influence on Miller, as he was to many up and coming comedians in the area at the time. Young comedians gathered at Leno&#x27;s home late at night and he offered critiques with humorous, biting wit. Leno also taped television appearances of his group and showed them during such sessions while offering more humorous critiques. Miller later fondly recalled the time, saying it was like &quot;sitting at his knee, querying Yoda&quot;.

Miller appeared on &quot;Star Search&quot;, where he lost out to fellow comedian Sinbad after the two tied on judges&#x27; scores; Sinbad won with a higher studio-audience approval rating. Miller made his first appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; on June 24, 1985 (other guests were Phil Collins and María Conchita Alonso).

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==
===Audition===
In 1985, Miller was discovered by Lorne Michaels at The Comedy Store. Miller subsequently auditioned for &quot;SNL&quot; in Los Angeles, and did well enough for a second audition at Times Square in New York. About 70 people watched this second audition—this was most of the show&#x27;s staff along with Lorne Michaels, Paul Simon, and Dan Aykroyd. Miller walked into a well-lit room and was told &quot;Go ahead, you have eight minutes, Dennis.&quot;

After the New York audition he went to dinner with Michaels and Jack Nicholson. Miller felt that this was just another aspect of his audition, to see if he could handle himself around famous people, so he &quot;just sat there quietly&quot;. Miller later recalled the conclusion of the meeting with Michaels: &quot;He looked at me and goes, &#x27;Would you like to do my newscast?&#x27;. And I said, &#x27;Yeah, I would&#x27;, and he said, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow&#x27;. And then I walked out. And I remember thinking, &#x27;My life has just changed.&#x27;&quot;

===&quot;Weekend Update&quot;===

Miller succeeded Christopher Guest as the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor. The spot was supposed to go to comic Jon Lovitz, but Lovitz was scheduled for other parts on the show and needed the &quot;Update&quot; segment to do costume changes, so Miller was drafted to read the news. His comedy was apolitical before &quot;SNL&quot; but politics came easy through opening a newspaper and building a new act around a few headlines. He made his stage persona a bit sardonic, as he noticed people who had done the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment as nice guys quickly lost the role.

Miller began his fictional news reports with &quot;Good evening, and what can I tell ya?&quot; and closed with &quot;Guess what, folks? That&#x27;s the news, and I... am... outta here!&quot; Fans of &quot;SNL&quot; became accustomed to his snarky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair—idiosyncrasies that were spoofed by Dana Carvey, Tom Hanks, and Jimmy Fallon, all of whom have impersonated Miller on the show.

During his time at &quot;SNL&quot;, Miller released a stand-up comedy album, &quot;The Off-White Album&quot; in 1988. It drew heavily from the observational and metaphor-driven style he was known for on the show, and showed glimpses of the political humor that influenced his later work. An HBO special, &quot;Dennis Miller: Black and White&quot;, aired shortly after the release of the CD.

Although Miller spent much of his time on &quot;SNL&quot; behind the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; desk, he was included in some sketches. He did a few recurring characters as well as celebrity impersonations including Gary Hart, George Harrison, and Nathaniel Crosby.

===Leaving &quot;SNL&quot;===
It was thought that he would renew his contract with NBC until at least 1993, but Miller left &quot;SNL&quot; in 1991, after six years, turning over the anchor&#x27;s chair to Kevin Nealon.
Miller was happy with his role on the show, but chose to move on because he had turned 38 and his 18-month-old son Holden made him want to strive for things to &quot;make the boy proud.&quot; At the time of his departure, he was (briefly) the longest-running cast member, as he was the first cast member to stay on the show for more than five seasons. However, this record would quickly be surpassed by former cast mates such as Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, and Kevin Nealon, all of whom stayed on the show a few more years (with Nealon getting said record with his departure in 1995, and holding the record until the end of the 1990s).

Miller soon had a late-night talk show in development (&quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;), and it was believed that fans of Letterman would naturally be interested in Miller&#x27;s show and prefer that over Leno&#x27;s in that time slot. He told an interviewer, &quot;I had a great gig and this came up. It seemed like an opportunity that doesn&#x27;t present itself too frequently in your life, so I opted to take it... I wanted to see what other talents I had, so I decided this was the shot.&quot;

===Anniversary special absences===

Miller did not appear on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, and rumors spread that he and fellow alum Victoria Jackson had not been invited due to their conservative political activism. He took to Twitter to dispel the claims, saying Lorne Michaels was classy, well-mannered and invited everyone, but he declined. He later told an interviewer that he would have loved to be there, but could not due to family commitments. Miller also declined to appear at the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special.

==Eponymous shows==

===&quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;===
After it was announced that Miller would start his own show, he was a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.&quot; Carson offered him some advice while reflecting on his own 30-year career from which he was retiring in May 1992. In preparation, Miller sharpened his interviewing skills by practicing on the show&#x27;s stage hands. He felt that the secret to interviewing well was listening to the guest rather than trying to set up jokes while the guest is talking. As the date for the show&#x27;s opening approached, Miller told an interviewer that he was both thrilled and &quot;scared shitless&quot; by the opportunity. He saw Carson&#x27;s approach as the standard but hoped to be original.

In 1992, Miller began hosting his eponymous late-night talk show. Syndication lasted seven months. Launched in January 1992, it was an attempt by syndicator Tribune Entertainment to carve out a niche in the late-night television landscape after Carson&#x27;s retirement from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that May and his replacement by Jay Leno. Bob Odenkirk and Norm Macdonald served as writers for the show. &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot; built an insignificant audience and was cancelled in July.

===&quot;Dennis Miller Live&quot;===
Beginning in 1994, Miller hosted &quot;Dennis Miller Live&quot;, a half-hour talk show on HBO. The show was taped at CBS Television City on the same stage where &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; is taped. It utilized a small set, sparse lighting, no band and Miller speaking to the largely-unseen studio audience from a darkened stage.

Miller hosted one guest per show, with whom he discussed the topic of the day. Early on, guests were all interviewed live via satellite, but soon most appeared live in the studio. Miller and his writing staff won five Emmy Awards during the show&#x27;s run, which aired 215 episodes over nine years. HBO cancelled the show in 2002.

===CNBC show===

====Background====
Miller was considered for a prime-time talk show at MSNBC in 2002 as well as a regular commentator on the Fox News show &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; in 2003 before landing a prime-time political show weeknights on CNBC, simply called &quot;Dennis Miller&quot;. It began airing on January 26, 2004, in the 9:00 p.m. (ET) slot, which placed him against Fox&#x27;s Bill O&#x27;Reilly.

CNBC announced that they were &quot;comfortable with an unabashed Bush fan in the middle of its prime-time schedule in an election year.&quot; Their president Pamela Thomas-Graham said, &quot;When we hired Dennis, we knew exactly what his political beliefs were and his viewers will hear them. The reason we hired him is we think he&#x27;s witty, smart and interesting.&quot; She contrasted his political leanings to that of John McEnroe&#x27;s, whose own talk show followed Miller&#x27;s in the lineup.

Miller promised to serve as &quot;an ombudsman&quot; who will tell it like it is and become &quot;incensed&quot; on the viewer&#x27;s behalf&quot;. When asked if he had the credentials to do a quasi-news show, Miller stressed he was an entertainer. &quot;I don&#x27;t have credibility, I&#x27;m a comedian. I&#x27;m not Ed Murrow up on the roof in a London Fog reporting on the Blitz.&quot;

====Content====
The hour-long show contained a daily news segment called &quot;The Daily Rorschach,&quot; an interview segment, a panel discussion dubbed &quot;The Varsity,&quot; and humorous field pieces by fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alum Tim Meadows and &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;&#x27;s Ant. Stylistically, Miller was seen by some as &quot;attempting to be serious, angry, and funny all at the same time,&quot; and the show was compared to that of Bill Maher. Reviewers felt Miller&#x27;s riffs would benefit from a live audience, and the show incorporated a &quot;nightclub-style audience of 100 or so&quot; beginning on March 9, 2004.

&quot;The Daily Rorschach,&quot; which were wordy riffs on news events, was reminiscent of his role on &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Update&quot; and his HBO show. On Miller&#x27;s interviews, &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; remarked, &quot;Miller may be up front about his own political affiliation, even to the point of shilling for the Republicans, but despite his increasingly aggressive America-first humor, he is unusually evenhanded in his selection of guests.&quot; &quot;The Varsity,&quot; which offered a wide variety of political viewpoints on current topics, included frequent panelists Ed Schultz, Gloria Allred, Willie Brown, David Horowitz, Mickey Kaus, Steven Katz, Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell, Phil Hendrie, and Harry Shearer. In these segments, Miller acted &quot;less like a host than a fellow conversationalist, and seems as happy to listen as to interrupt.&quot;

In the beginning of the series, Miller had a chimpanzee on the show named Ellie, who was declared a &quot;consultant.&quot; After a few appearances Ellie was replaced by a smaller, friendlier chimp named Mo. Mo was noted for swinging across the studio on a rope, doing somersaults on the sofa while giving the appearance of reading &quot;Variety&quot;, and for nuzzling Miller while he gave his monologue.

====Reception and cancellation====
The group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting objected that one of the show&#x27;s producers was Mike Murphy, who was an adviser to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (Miller&#x27;s first guest on the show), and charged that CNBC was setting up a conflict of interest.

&quot;LA Weekly&quot; praised Miller for approaching the panel in a &quot;relatively relaxed and straightforward attitude.&quot; Despite having &quot;worked briefly as a commentator for &quot;Hannity and Colmes&quot; on Fox, he&#x27;s far from being a Murdochian attack dog, and he often sits there and sucks it up while people tell him just how awful the administration of his beloved commander-in-chief really is... Miller, it turns out, is considerably more interested in &#x27;diversity&#x27; than some of his liberal counterparts.&quot;

The show was openly pro-President George W. Bush and its debut coincided with a major decline in Bush&#x27;s approval numbers. While Miller&#x27;s rating started out well with his first episode (&quot;The New York Times&quot; put the figure at 746,000 people), by March 2004 his numbers had slipped to 300,000. This was in contrasted to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with Jon Stewart, which attracted 1.9 million viewers, and which aired at the later time slot of 11 pm.

By April 2005, Miller&#x27;s viewership had declined to 107,000 (a 59% drop from the year before). CNBC canceled the show in May 2005 as part of the network&#x27;s move to refocus on financial news (airings of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and shows hosted by John McEnroe and Tina Brown were also cancelled). Miller&#x27;s show was replaced with a second airing of &quot;Mad Money with Jim Cramer&quot;.

===Westwood One radio show===
In January 2007, Miller signed a deal with Westwood One (later acquired by Dial Global, which rebranded itself as Westwood One) to launch &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;, a weekday three-hour talk radio program. The program debuted on March 26, 2007, and ran through February 27, 2015. A few months into his radio show, Miller noted that his radio show best represented his actual unvarnished views, saying &quot;This time, if I&#x27;m fired, they will be firing the real Dennis Miller.&quot;

The show&#x27;s website provided a live stream of the broadcast, which was free, but a subscription to the Dennis Miller Zone (DMZ) was required in order to access archived broadcasts. The show aired on 250+ stations, airing on tape delay on some of those stations between 6–9 pm ET and 9 pm-12 am ET. His on-air sidekick &quot;Salman&quot; (David S. Weiss) also wrote for &quot;Dennis Miller Live&quot;. His producer Christian Bladt previously appeared on-camera as dozens of different characters during the &quot;Daily Rorschach&quot; segment on his CNBC television show.

Miller&#x27;s program included serious discussions about American culture, current events, politics, and their place in the global context. The show was infused with Miller&#x27;s sarcasm and obscure pop culture references. The first hour&#x27;s opening phrase was a combination of dialogue from the film &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot; and a U.S. space program slogan coined by Alan Shepard: &quot;What&#x27;s up, Hiroshi? Let&#x27;s light this candle!&quot; Miller&#x27;s opening phrases for his second and third hours respectively were &quot;Come to me my babies, let me quell your pain&quot;, (Powers Boothe as Jim Jones in &quot;Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones&quot;) and &quot;ABC – Always be closing if you want the knife set&quot; (from &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;).

Most shows featured three guests (one per hour) as well as calls from listeners. Guests included fellow comedians and &quot;SNL&quot; alumni, pundits and authors, Presidential candidates, and sports commentators. Regulars included columnists and conservatives such as Debra Saunders, Charles Krauthammer, Victor Davis Hanson, John Bolton, Bill Kristol, and Jerome Corsi.

According to &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot;, as of spring 2011, Miller&#x27;s show had an estimated 2,250,000 weekly listeners. Miller and Dial Global signed an agreement in early 2012 to continue his show for three years. Miller ended the radio show after his contract expired on March 27, 2015.

Eventually Miller joined the podcasting world with &quot;The Dennis Miller Option&quot; which was a sort of continuation of his old radio show, albeit only for an hour weekly. It featured interviews with some of the same guests from the radio days, emails from listeners, and the usual Miller rants. He decided to retire from the show after the Elections in 2020 as he felt that the political climate had become too divisive.

===&quot;Dennis Miller + One&quot;===
Miller hosted &quot;Dennis Miller + One&quot;, on RT America, a channel funded by the Russian government, from March 9, 2020, until early 2022. The half-hour program was produced by Ora TV and aired twice weekly, featuring interviews with sports and entertainment celebrities. In line with the name of the show, Miller interviewed a single guest for the entire half hour. The show replaced &quot;Larry King Now&quot;, on which Miller had been a frequent guest host until King&#x27;s death in February 2021. In February 2022, Miller quit the show due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, shortly before RT withdrew from the American market in March.

==Other endeavors==

Miller hosted the MTV Video Music Awards in 1995 and 1996. He was also the host of HBO&#x27;s 1996 series of election specials, &quot;Not Necessarily the Election&quot;.

He has appeared in various television commercials, serving as a spokesman for M&amp;M&#x27;s candies, 10-10-220 long-distance service, Miller beer, and the Internet service provider NetZero. About these activities he has remarked: &quot;Everybody has to sell out at some point to make a living.&quot;

===&quot;Monday Night Football&quot;===

====Background====
In June 2000, Miller auditioned as an announcer for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, a program which was struggling with declining ratings at the time and needed a new announcer after the firing of Boomer Esiason. Miller&#x27;s audition was alongside Al Michaels, the then-current announcer for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, in a mock broadcast. Miller&#x27;s NFL knowledge surprised those in attendance. He had grown up watching the 1970s championship Steelers and was an avid watcher of the NFL draft. He had even inquired about an announcing job with Fox after they had acquired rights to show NFL games in 1994. Michaels later told an interviewer, &quot;It was way beyond what we expected. I had no idea that he knew as much about football as he did. He made points that other analysts we brought in never made, and his points were more salient, more interesting, and better stated.&quot;

In late June 2000, Miller was announced as a new color commentator on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. ABC Sports President Howard Katz told The Associated Press that he approved of trying something new with the show and taking a risk. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Miller&#x27;s hiring &quot;one of the boldest moves in sports television history.&quot; After the announcement, Miller appeared on the July 3, 2000, cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; with the title &quot;Can Dennis Miller Save &#x27;Monday Night Football?&#x27;&quot; Miller told reporters that he would not try to dominate the show and insisted that his role would not be that of a comedian. Miller stated, &quot;I&#x27;m going to try to stay in the background and ask questions a fan would ask. The rants are my HBO show and I won&#x27;t try to recreate that.&quot;

====Commentary====
Miller and the new broadcasting team began airing through the preseason, starting on July 31, 2000. The show&#x27;s official season opener was on September 4, 2000, with the Denver Broncos at the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams. Miller&#x27;s performance at the official opener was met with mixed reviews. AP and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; held that Miller had improved from preseason, but &quot;The Washington Times&quot; said he &quot;comes off as being a smug, smarmy, smirking sort,&quot; and &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; suggested, &quot;Send Miller back to the Comedy Channel. ... This guy just isn&#x27;t very good.&quot; As his first season progressed, Miller&#x27;s critics held that &quot;he sounds scripted&quot; and the show&#x27;s ratings continued to decline. As the ratings did not improve, writers from &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; began openly calling for Miller to be let go.

Throughout Miller&#x27;s football coverage his commentary was sprinkled with esoteric references. A common Miller-ism was after a Hail Mary pass fell incomplete, he would say &quot;Hail Mary is denied—separation of church and state.&quot; He also once referred to &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot;—the St. Louis Rams offense—as the &quot;Murderer&#x27;s Row of Haste.&quot; Online options arose to offer definitions to references made by Miller on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;: a website called &quot;Dennis Miller Demystified,&quot; &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Annotated Dennis Miller,&quot; and the &quot;Shadowpack&quot; (a &quot;content aggregator, formatter, and e-commerce app&quot;) giving real-time explanations on personal digital assistant. Miller stated he was flattered by such attention.

====Leaving &quot;MNF&quot;====
Although Miller signed a contract for a third year, ABC soon began negotiations with veteran football commentator John Madden. Madden had worked at Fox Sports for eight years since the network had won the contract for the NFC Conference games away from CBS in 1994. Since getting the NFL contract, Fox had lost $4.4 billion and was looking to cut programming costs. Madden&#x27;s contract for the next year would cost Fox $8 million so, when ABC was approaching Madden, Fox agreed to let him out of his remaining year. In March 2002, it was announced that Miller would be replaced by Madden, who was signed on February 28, 2002.

Miller later reflected that &quot;the football thing was fun for me. I was in the middle of a maelstrom and I just decided not to pay attention to it because, for me, getting hired was a freakish act of nature.&quot; Elsewhere he said, &quot;as soon as Madden left Fox, I pretty much knew I was going to be whacked. Here was Madden, the Pliny the Elder of football announcers. And they were going to stay with the kid? I was having fun. I had alienated half the community, and probably half of them liked me.&quot; Al Michaels, while overjoyed to work with Madden, praised Miller, saying, &quot;what he tried to do was the hardest thing ever attempted in broadcasting. No other non-football person or someone of that ilk could have pulled it off as well as he did.&quot;

In 2010, TV Guide Network listed Miller&#x27;s stint at No. 12 on their list of &quot;25 Biggest TV Blunders&quot;, while Awful Announcing put him at No. 1 in their list of the &quot;Top 10 Sports Media Busts&quot;.

===Fox News, game shows, and &quot;Sports Unfiltered&quot;===
Miller frequently guested on Fox News in the late 2000s. He appeared on 13 of the 17 aired episodes of the comedy show &quot;The 1/2 Hour News Hour&quot; in 2007. He had a weekly segment called &quot;Miller Time&quot; on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, and has also appeared on &quot;Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld&quot;.

Miller briefly co-hosted the game show &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, which aired on GSN for eight episodes in 2007. For one month, Miller hosted &quot;Amne$ia&quot; for NBC. The show was a replacement program commissioned during the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike and was canceled once the strike was resolved and scripted programming returned to the network.

In November 2007, Versus tapped Miller to host &quot;Sports Unfiltered&quot;, a weekly one-hour sports talk show. It was canceled after eight episodes.

==Comedic style==

For the first year and a half of his comedy career, Miller relied heavily on props, but he felt this limited him and switched to using purely language. To address the stage-fright he developed when initially beginning his stand-up career, Miller later stated &quot;I got up there and acted like the guy I always wanted to be to get through it... it&#x27;s a part of me, but it&#x27;s not the real me.&quot; He kept his hands in his pockets to appear unfazed, or adjusted his cuffs during an audience laugh to give the appearance of indifference to approval. Miller pointed out that part of his act is to show a &quot;hipper-than-thou&quot; persona, but then purposely undermine it at regular intervals for comedic effect.

Miller has a laid-back style (for example, calling people &quot;babe&quot; or &quot;cat&quot;) with a characteristic spoken cadence, and an acerbic, brooding sense of humor. His specialty is the rant, which typically begin with &quot;Now, I don&#x27;t want to get off on a rant here, but...&quot; before launching into a passionate discussion of a given subject, ending with &quot;...of course, that&#x27;s just my opinion. I could be wrong.&quot;

Miller listed his comedic influences for &quot;The New York Times&quot; as including &quot;Jonathan Miller, Richard Pryor, Richard Belzer and Mr. [Jay] Leno.&quot; When the &quot;Times&quot; asked him about the comedians Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce, to whom he is often compared, Miller stated that he had been impressed with transcripts of Sahl&#x27;s early work but that as Sahl&#x27;s career continued he became too tied to the Kennedy family and became a &quot;savage name-dropper,&quot; which diminished him in Miller&#x27;s eyes, and served as an example for him to avoid. Miller had no respect for Bruce, telling the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Lenny was a heroin addict, and I couldn&#x27;t care less about heroin addicts. Once I hear a guy is a heroin addict, and they tell me he&#x27;s a genius, I think, &#x27;Really?&#x27; I&#x27;m not trying to be judgmental. But anybody whose last vision is of a tile pattern on a bathroom floor, I don&#x27;t know what kind of genius they are.&quot;

Describing his career Miller stated, &quot;It&#x27;s all been built on arcane references, precision of language, and a reasonably imperturbable nature on TV. The basics are there, but I&#x27;ve been getting paid, making a living and having fun with it for next to 25 years, and you know that blows my mind that I&#x27;ve stuck with it. That&#x27;s my favorite part of showbiz, hangin&#x27; in, knowing that something good is coming along. ... When I was starting, I thought I&#x27;d have to have a sword-in-the-stone moment of inspiration where I&#x27;d have to lay around for it to be visited on me. &quot;SNL&quot; was just a machine, and if you screwed two or three &#x27;Updates&#x27; up, guess what, they have someone new and ready to go. So I learned how to pick up any newspaper and have five usable jokes in five minutes. &quot;I don&#x27;t ever wanna get self-important. I&#x27;m a comedian, and I want everyone in my life to know it. The stream-of-consciousness style is my monkey trick. I sit there, I watch stuff, and cultural references bump into my head. I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid.&quot;

Miller has referred to his casual stage-style as &quot;quasi-Dean Martin insouciance.&quot; When asked if he has accepted others&#x27; title of him as &quot;the &#x27;intelligent&#x27; comedian,&quot; he replied, &quot;The smartest thing I ever did was not buying into the fact that people thought I was smart. I was telling jokes about where I named the robot maid for The Jetsons. It&#x27;s just a joke. I just did jokes. I never had my head up my ass that I mattered. I&#x27;m trying to get laughs... I&#x27;m OK [intelligence-wise]. I remember I had a writer once who told me—and we disagreed about everything, so I know he didn&#x27;t think I was smart—but he said, &#x27;I&#x27;ll give you this. You have a deep drawer and a nice retrieval system.&#x27; I always thought that was a good appraisal of whatever limited comedy gift I had. I have a pretty good memory for pop arcana and a pretty quick retrieval system.&quot;

==Personal life==
Miller married Carolyn &quot;Ali&quot; Espley, a former model from Vancouver, British Columbia on April 24, 1988. Espley is best known as the girl in Kajagoogoo&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Too Shy&quot; music video. The couple live in Santa Barbara and have two sons who were born in 1990 and 1993.

==Political views==

Although in his early years of fame he was perceived as staunch liberal and an outspoken critic of Republicans, in recent years Miller has become known for his neoconservative political opinions.

===Early outlook===
When asked if his political outlook was a result of early influence by his parents, Miller told a reporter &quot;I didn&#x27;t know my dad—he moved out early. And my mom&#x27;s politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn&#x27;t think about Democrats or Republicans. She thought about who made sense. I&#x27;ve been both in my life. Somebody can say they don&#x27;t understand why somebody drifts. But I&#x27;ve always found people who drift interesting, &#x27;cause it shows me the game&#x27;s not stagnant in their own head. They&#x27;re thinking.&quot;

In 1995, Miller told &quot;USA Today&quot;: &quot;I might be profane and opinionated, but underneath all that are some pretty conservative feelings. On most issues, between Clinton and Newt Gingrich, I&#x27;d choose Newt in a second, even though he is a bit too exclusionary.&quot; Miller also declared himself a &quot;conservative libertarian&quot; in a 1996 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview.

Miller later told &quot;American Enterprise&quot; that one of the reasons he became more conservative was due to liberal critiques of Mayor Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s approach to fighting crime in New York City, which began around 1994. &quot;When I kept hearing liberals equating Giuliani with Hitler—that&#x27;s when I really left the reservation. Even before 9/11, I&#x27;d travel to New York and say, &#x27;Wow, this city certainly seems to be running better. Giuliani is the kind of leader I admire. When it&#x27;s five below zero and you arrest somebody to get him inside off the street—that&#x27;s not something Hitler would do. It made me realize that I was with the wrong group if that&#x27;s what Hitler looked like to them.&quot;

===Post September 11 attacks===
Following the September 11 attacks, Miller&#x27;s political ideology changed significantly and his conservative views became more publicly known. His move from the Democratic to the Republican Party was further facilitated by watching a 2004 presidential primary debate between nine Democrats. &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen a starting nine like that since the &#x27;62 Mets,&quot; he remarked.

In 2006, &quot;Slate&quot; commentator Dennis Cass describes Miller&#x27;s political evolution from a &quot;left-leaning, Dada-ist wisenheimer&quot; to a &quot;tell-it-like-it-is, right-wing blowhard.&quot; The perceived change did not surprise former &quot;SNL&quot; colleague and former Democratic Party Senator Al Franken, who noted Miller had always had a &quot;conservative streak.&quot; In another interview Franken stated, &quot;Dennis was always sort of conservative on certain kinds of issues. I am not quite sure why he decided to become a comedian with a dog in the fight, but as a comedian with a dog in the fight I sympathize with him.&quot;

His political outspokenness led him to become one of the few Hollywood celebrities backing George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. In 2003, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; called Miller &quot;the loudest pro-Bush/pro-war voice in Hollywood&quot;, and quoted his comments on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; from February of that year, where Miller advocated invading Iraq and vented his displeasure at France&#x27;s lack of support for the idea. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that he was &quot;raising his political profile&quot; at this time, and that he &quot;spoke out passionately in favor of the war in Iraq. He has made frequent appearances on conservative talk radio; he does weekly political commentary for &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, a Fox News Channel talk show.&quot; That same year, &quot;The National Review&quot; wrote, &quot;Conservatives ... have welcomed and even cheered the comedian&#x27;s unabashed patriotism and endorsement of President Bush&#x27;s foreign—and, in certain cases, domestic—policy.&quot; They noted that &quot;During appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, he has also advocated profiling at airports and oil-drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&quot;

While he was not at all shy about expressing his conservative views on topics such as taxes and foreign policy, Miller was quick to point out that he is quite liberal on many social issues. During a 2004 interview, Miller said &quot;If two gay guys want to get married, it&#x27;s none of my business. I could care less. More power to them. I&#x27;m happy when people fall in love.&quot; He added, &quot;I think abortion&#x27;s wrong, but it&#x27;s none of my business to tell somebody what&#x27;s wrong. So I&#x27;m pro-choice. I want to keep my nose out of other people&#x27;s personal business.&quot; In 2006, he noted in an interview with Penn Jillette that his liberal attitude on social issues made him a libertarian, saying &quot;that&#x27;s what I am, I&#x27;ll be honest with you.&quot;

In 2007, Miller admitted that his open conservatism may have cost him some passing acquaintances, but it has not affected &quot;my dear friends. I certainly hope our friendship runs deeper than that. I still have some ultra-liberal friends.&quot; In a 2012 interview, Miller showed no concern over whether his political stance had made him less popular or robbed him of the credit of popularizing comedic rants, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a 58-year-old man and I&#x27;m happy where I&#x27;m at. I don&#x27;t think about any of that. I go on &quot;O&#x27;Reilly&quot; once a week, I do my radio show and I go on the road about 20 dates a year... If you&#x27;re 58 and you&#x27;re still worrying about whether you&#x27;re popular, what are you, in eighth grade?&quot;

===George W. Bush===
Miller made several jokes about the George W. Bush administration before 9/11. He poked fun at George W. Bush&#x27;s intelligence on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, saying &quot;God, the man thinks Croatia is the show that&#x27;s on after &quot;Moesha&quot;.&quot; In another incident he joked, &quot;Bush can&#x27;t walk and fart at the same time.&quot; In January 2001 on his HBO series, Miller joked, &quot;Condoleezza Rice has often been described as W&#x27;s &#x27;foreign policy tutor.&#x27; Oh, yeah, I love the sound of that. It&#x27;s nice to know we&#x27;re signing our nuclear arsenal over to a man who needs after-school help.&quot;

After 9/11, Miller&#x27;s opinion on Bush changed significantly. In 2003, Miller told an interviewer that he was impressed by Bush for pursuing &quot;the liquidation of terrorism,&quot; even though &quot;that&#x27;s not gonna be finished in his lifetime... But to take the first step? Ballsy.&quot; In October 2003, Miller praised Bush in an interview with &quot;The American Enterprise&quot;, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s much smarter than his enemies think he is. I think he&#x27;s a genius. People whine about him getting into Yale—the way I see it, if your old man buys a building you should get into Yale! But I think he could have gotten into Yale on his own; he&#x27;s a very smart man.&quot; He also noted Bush&#x27;s faith, saying &quot;In this messed up world, I like seeing my President pray... This is an infinitely complex world, and at some point one has to have faith in one&#x27;s religion. I find it endearing that President Bush prays to God and that he&#x27;s not an agnostic or an atheist. I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s someone higher that he has to answer to.&quot;

Miller began to appear at events for Bush starting in 2003. In June, Miller spoke at the President&#x27;s fund-raisers in San Francisco and Los Angeles. After the San Francisco appearance, he was invited to ride in the Presidential limousine and fly on Air Force One to travel to the dinner at Los Angeles. Miller also sat in the gallery at President Bush&#x27;s State of the Union address on January 21, 2004. That same month, Miller told The Associated Press that his CNBC show was not going to do any jokes about George W. Bush, explaining, &quot;I like him. I&#x27;m going to give him a pass. I take care of my friends.&quot; Miller later reflected in a 2008 interview: &quot;I thought it was so integral that he got re-elected that I laid off him for awhile.&quot;

Reflecting on his thoughts near the end of Bush&#x27;s second term in 2007, Miller still had good words when talking about Bush. &quot;After 9/11 it was a different world. One where crazies strap a bomb to their kids in the name of religion. Bush and (Rudy) Giuliani were fearless leaders during the national crisis. Thank God Bush chose to stay on the offense.&quot;

===Candidacy consideration===
In 2003, Rob Stutzman and other members of the leadership for the Californian Republican party, after seeing the political success of Arnold Schwarzenegger, approached Miller in an effort to draft him to challenge Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer.

When asked about the possibility of facing a Miller candidacy, Boxer spokesman Roy Behr dismissed his odds: &quot;The Republican Party has gone through a desperate search to find someone who is remotely credible—they&#x27;ve looked at everybody and everything, and they couldn&#x27;t find anybody, so they&#x27;re looking at bringing in the circus.&quot; &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;&#x27;s Bill Whalen saw that, with the ascent of Schwarzenegger, other celebrities were considering political careers (such as Republican Kelsey Grammer). Examining Miller&#x27;s chances for the Senate seat the &quot;Standard&quot; pointed out that it was &quot;hard to imagine a candidate quicker on the draw or more withering in a debate&quot; and noted other Republican celebrities successfully made the transition to elected politician because they &quot;embodied optimism.&quot; Miller, the &quot;Standard&quot; proclaimed, was seen in contrast as &quot;both terribly erudite... and decidedly yuppie (the comedian endorses DirecTV and Amstel Light...) Not to mention a little too edgy for some Republicans.&quot; When asked about Miller&#x27;s chances, Martin Kaplan, director of USC&#x27;s Norman Lear Center, theorized that Miller might face a tough primary battle to win the Republican nomination from other members of the party that had actual political experience.

By November 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; did a piece on the Republican opposition to Boxer and reported that &quot;Mr. Miller was never serious about the idea, Republican officials who spoke with him say. ... &#x27;Dennis has never contacted us,&#x27; said George M. Sundheim III, chairman of the state Republican Party&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; pointed out that while the Republican Party was talking about drafting him, Miller &quot;had signed a multiyear contract with CNBC as a political talk show host.&quot;

Miller, invoking his pleasant home life in Santa Barbara with his wife and two children, later told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;They inquired about my availability to run against Barbara Boxer, but I&#x27;m not at the point where I would consider it.&quot; He expanded on the subject in an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine saying he had declined the draft offer because &quot;At some point that involves moving to Washington, D.C., sitting in a room all day with a moron like Barbara Boxer. I&#x27;m just not interested.&quot; He told the Associated Press, &quot;Maybe when I get older I would think about it, just as a lark, view it as its own form of a TV show. I think it would be fun to get in there and turn out the whole process—just refuse to play, and don&#x27;t budge. Get rid of me if you want, but I&#x27;m just going to do what I want.&quot;

===Political support===
In 1988, Miller voted for George H. W. Bush, a fact he brought up in 1992 as proof that he was &quot;essentially conservative.&quot;

In 1992, Miller, who had endorsed the candidacy of Jerry Brown during the Democratic primaries, moved his support to Independent candidate Ross Perot. Miller volunteered for Ross Perot&#x27;s candidacy at his San Fernando Valley campaign office. Miller told a reporter, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that you need to know that much about him. He&#x27;s an outsider, and the two-party system is going to hell.&quot; Miller stated that he had become &quot;really grossed out by the system after observing the behavior of politicians in both parties during the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas. When Ross Perot dropped out of the Presidential race on July 16, 1992, saying he feared a conspiracy against his family, many began to joke about his sanity. On July 30, 1995, Miller told a reporter, &quot;I&#x27;d vote for him [Perot] tomorrow. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a genius but I love the thought of him at State Dinners mistaking the Queen of Denmark for Kaye Ballard. People say to me, &#x27;You wouldn&#x27;t want Ross Perot with his finger on the button.&#x27; But believe me, they would never let Ross Perot near the real button. They would rig up a stunt button for him, and if he ever pressed it, it would squirt him in the face with milk or something.&quot;

In 1995, considering the candidates for president, Miller told a reporter, &quot;I don&#x27;t respect Bill Clinton. He&#x27;s the same as [George H. W.] Bush or [Bob] Dole. Clinton&#x27;s my age, and I know how full of shit I am. So I look at him and think, &#x27;I know you. You&#x27;re the guy who used to tap the keg.&#x27;&quot; He continued to mock Clinton when he won the Presidency, and later admitted to voting for Bob Dole in the 1996 election (despite Perot being on the ballot in every state).

On February 21, 2007, while appearing as a guest on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, and again on May 25, 2007, while appearing as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Miller stated that he initially supported Rudy Giuliani for President in 2008. After Giuliani&#x27;s departure from the race he redirected his support to John McCain. Miller said that he gave Barack Obama six to eight months before forming an opinion on him, because he saw that his election was inspiring to black youth and hoped it would be healing. He came to the conclusion that Obama was mostly hype, and in actuality, &quot;He&#x27;s an inept civil servant who stinks.&quot;

Miller endorsed Herman Cain in the 2012 Republican primary, but later dropped his support, saying of Cain, &quot;He can&#x27;t win!&quot; He later campaigned for Mitt Romney in the general election. After the Presidential election of 2012, Miller appeared on Fox News and said that under Obama, the US is on the road to the &quot;European model&quot;.

In 2016, Miller did not endorse any particular Republican primary candidate. By December 16, 2015, he told Bill O&#x27;Reilly, &quot;I would vote for any of them over Hillary, except for Lindsey Graham... and Pataki.&quot; Miller became a strong supporter of Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. general election, addressing a tweet to Republicans who were uncertain after Trump wrapped up the nomination: &quot;Don&#x27;t kid yourself. At this point, any vote for anyone that is not Donald Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton. Also, both Presidential boxes left blank is a vote for Hillary Clinton because, as mindless as Liberals can be, even they don&#x27;t enter into suicide pacts with that petulant, whiny part of themselves.&quot;

<text>News of the World is the sixth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 28 October 1977 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. &quot;News of the World&quot; was the band&#x27;s second album to be recorded at Sarm and Wessex Sound Studios in London, and engineered by Mike Stone, and was co-produced by the band and Stone.

In 1977, punk rock acts, most notably the Sex Pistols, sparked massive backlash against progressive rock artists such as Queen, to which the band responded by simplifying their symphonic rock sound and gearing towards a more spontaneous hard rock sound. The album subsequently reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and number 3 on the US Top Albums chart while achieving high certifications around the world. It has sold over 4 million copies in United States. Its lead single, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Critical reaction to &quot;News of the World&quot; was initially mixed, with many reviewers commenting on the band&#x27;s change in musical style. However, it has since come to be regarded as one of Queen&#x27;s greatest albums, while &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; have since become rock anthems.

==Background and recording==
After completing the &quot;A Day at the Races Tour&quot; in June 1977, the quartet entered the studio to begin work on their sixth studio offering in July 1977, enlisting Mike Stone as assistant producer at Sarm East and Wessex studios in London. The initial activity began on 4 July when Taylor and assistant &#x27;Crystal&#x27; Taylor arrived in a lorry at Sarm to set up his drum kit, which continued over the next two days. That Wednesday, on 6 July, the rest of the band arrived at Sarm. They did backing track takes for &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot;.

After recording all the backing tracks, work moved to Wessex Sound, again preceded by two days dedicated to drum kit set up. The lorry arrived on 1 August, and drum kit construction would continue well into 2 August. Andy Turner, a tea boy at Wessex, recalls thinking &quot;You&#x27;re being charged £200 an hour for this!&quot; At Wessex, the band overdubbed onto the backing tracks. Some songs had been previously overdubbed, such as &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot;, &quot;Who Needs You&quot;, &quot;All Dead All Dead&quot;, and &quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot;. During the last few days of overdubbing, on 22 August, calls to the U.S. would be made regarding venues for the band&#x27;s tour in November.

According to studio documentation, a lot of sessions had late arrivals, which were usually pre-arranged around an hour before the band would actually arrive. The median shift length was around 3pm - 11pm, but sometimes the band would stay in the studio until 4am if they were falling behind schedule. The last principal overdubbing session was on 23 August, with the first mixes the next day on 24 August. Occasionally, further overdubbing would occur, as mixing continued. On 26 August, &quot;We Are The Champions&quot; was mixed, followed by &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot;, and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; on 27 August, and Take 12 of &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; on 28 August.

After taking a day off for the Summer Bank Holiday, the band went to Leighton Mans Studios and Primrose Hill Studios on 30 August, although the output of these sessions is unknown. They also spent a day at Olympic Studios on 31 August. The last documented overdubbing session was on 1 September. Mixing continued until 4 September at Wessex, during which there was a delay on 3 September due to technical issues. That day, Roger appeared on the last episode of the show &quot;Saturday Scene&quot;. The mixes were delivered back to Sarm Studios on 5 September for mastering, which would be completed on 16 September.
They scaled down their complex arrangements and focused on a &quot;rootsier&quot; sound (as Brian May put it). However, the staple of the Queen sound – multi-tracked harmonies and guitar orchestrations – still exist on this album, albeit more subtly than previously. Having received some criticism that their first completely self-produced album, &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, was a &quot;boring&quot; album, Queen decided to shift their musical focus towards the mainstream but remain as the producers of the next album. &quot;Races&quot; garnered criticism as many critics felt that it was too similar to &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, something which the band members themselves acknowledged. In addition, the arrival of punk rock, led by the Sex Pistols, saw the mainstream shift away from progressive rock and more towards simpler rock music. Queen were seen as the antithesis of punk, particularly in their camp influences and elaborate production.

Brian May stated in an interview that &quot;We&#x27;d already made a decision that...[after] &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, we wanted to go back to basics for &quot;News of the World&quot;. But it was very timely because the world was looking at punk and things being very stripped down. So in a sense we were conscious, but it was part of our evolution anyway.&quot;

In contrast to &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, which had taken five months to record, only two months were booked to record at Sarm East and Wessex Sound Studios. Most of the recording sessions took place in Wessex Studios, which was also where the Sex Pistols were busy recording &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;. As such, the two groups had several interactions, including the famous meeting between Mercury and Sid Vicious. Vicious, upon stumbling into Queen&#x27;s recording studio, asked &quot;Have you succeeded in bringing ballet to the masses yet?&quot; in response to a comment the singer had made in an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, to which Mercury called him &quot;Simon Ferocious&quot; (a playful reference to Vicious&#x27; stage name) and replied &quot;We&#x27;re doing our best, dear.&quot; Johnny Rotten also expressed a desire to meet with Mercury. According to Bill Price, who engineered &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;, Rotten crawled on all fours across Queen&#x27;s studio to Mercury, who was playing piano, and said &quot;Hello Freddie&quot; before leaving. Queen&#x27;s history with the Sex Pistols dated back to December 1976, in which Queen were set to appear on Bill Grundy&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. However, Mercury had a toothache, and was forced to schedule a dentist appointment on the same day, his first one in 15 years. As a replacement, EMI offered the Sex Pistols instead, which led to their now famous appearance on the &quot;Today&quot; show.

==Songs==
===Overview===
&quot;News of the World&quot; shows Queen&#x27;s songwriting less dominated by Mercury and May than previously, with Roger Taylor and John Deacon composing two songs each. It has been classified as hard rock and arena rock, and has been regarded as a transitional album due to its shift towards a more minimalist production. Its songs are notable for their eclectic themes which would crystallise on future albums &quot;Jazz&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;: &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; are arena rock, &quot;Who Needs You&quot; features a Latin influence, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; is punk rock, &quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot; is based upon blues rock, &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; features funk overtones, &quot;My Melancholy Blues&quot; imitates jazz and &quot;Fight from the Inside&quot; was the group&#x27;s first disco related song. Chuck Eddy said the album was widely regarded as a &quot;back-to-basics&quot; offering, minimising the group&#x27;s more ornate and &quot;multi-part-epic tendencies&quot;, with some even dubbing it Queen&#x27;s response to punk rock. He added, however, that the record &quot;sounds even more often like a response to funk&quot;, citing &quot;Fight from the Inside&quot; and &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot;, as well as the &quot;proto-rap sparseness&quot; of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;.

===Side one===
====&quot;We Will Rock You&quot;====

&quot;We Will Rock You&quot; () was released as the B-side of &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, and became one of Queen&#x27;s biggest songs worldwide as a staple of arena and stadium sets. It was a conscious decision by Brian May to make the song simple and anthemic (&#x27;stomp, stomp, clap, pause&#x27; per 4/4 measure), so that their live audience could be more directly involved in the show. In the videos for &#x27;We Will Rock You&#x27; and &#x27;Spread Your Wings&#x27;, which shows the band performing in the snow in Roger Taylor&#x27;s garden, May used a copy of his guitar. He supposedly did not want to submit his Red Special to the weather.

On 7 October 2017, Queen released a &quot;Raw Sessions&quot; version of the track to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;News of the World&quot;. It shows a radically different approach to the guitar solo and includes May&#x27;s count-in immediately prior to the recording.

====&quot;We Are the Champions&quot;====
According to Freddie Mercury, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; had already been written in 1975 but was not recorded until 1977. Released as a single with &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; reached number two in the UK and number four in the US. &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; was the first promotional video for which fan club members were invited to participate in the filming. The video was filmed at the New London Theatre on 6 October 1977. Everyone received a free single of &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, a day before the single was released. To thank the audience for their attendance and role in making the video, Queen performed a short free concert after the shoot. It is one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs.

On 7 October 2017, Queen released a &quot;Raw Sessions&quot; version of the track to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;News of the World&quot;. It was made from previously unheard vocal and instrumental takes from the original multi-track tapes. It also presents for the first time the original recorded length of the track, which is two choruses more than the 1977 edited single.

====&quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;====

&quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; was half-finished at the time of the 1974 album of the same name. Taylor sang lead on the demo, but for the final version the band decided Mercury should sing lead vocals, with Taylor singing the chorus. Rhythm guitar and bass were played by Taylor, apart from some guitar &quot;screams&quot; by May during the instrumental section. According to Eddy, the song is the &quot;most punk-sounding&quot; Queen song, highlighting its &quot;proto-no-wave guitar solo and proto-Devo lyrics blaming teenage angst on D.N.A. (i.e., nature not nurture)&quot;, and the &quot;toppling-over-itself tempo&quot; later reprised by Prince&#x27;s &quot;own punkest song&quot; &quot;Sister&quot; (1980).

====&quot;All Dead, All Dead&quot;====
&quot;All Dead, All Dead&quot; was written and sung by May, who also played piano with Mercury on backing vocals. In an episode of &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot;, May confirmed rumours that the song is partly inspired by the death of his boyhood pet cat.

On 27 October 2017, in celebration of the album&#x27;s 40th Anniversary, Queen released a specially created &quot;hybrid version&quot; of the track with previously unheard lead vocals by Mercury. It was accompanied with an animated lyric video of a cat exploring a place that is later revealed to be the inside of the robot of the album cover lying motionless in a field.

====&quot;Spread Your Wings&quot;====

&quot;Spread Your Wings&quot; was written by bassist John Deacon. The piano is played by Mercury, although Deacon mimes it in the music video. The video was filmed in the back garden of Taylor&#x27;s then house, when the weather was freezing, and the band performed in the snow. Mercury can be seen wearing star-shaped sunglasses in the video. May is seen playing a copy of his Red Special, owing to the cold weather conditions.

====&quot;Fight from the Inside&quot;====
&quot;Fight from the Inside&quot; was written and sung by Taylor. In addition to the drums, he also plays rhythm guitar and bass guitar; for the latter he borrowed Deacon&#x27;s instrument. It is also one of the few songs in the band&#x27;s discography recorded almost entirely by one member.

Guitarist Slash has cited the guitar riff to this song as one of his favourite riffs of all time.

=== Side two ===
==== &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; ====

&quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot;, written by Mercury, is among the most sexually oriented songs in the Queen catalogue. Eddy calls it one of the album&#x27;s funkier tracks, with a &quot;proto-industrial-music perviness&quot; which eventually morph into &quot;sex-moaning psychedelic spaces&quot; that constitute a form of &#x27;dub-metal&#x27; comparable to similar parts of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;.

The song was introduced into the band&#x27;s live show immediately after its release, and remained a staple of their &quot;medley&quot; until the end of the Hot Space Tour of 1982. On the Hot Space tour, the song was reduced to the first verse/chorus only as a way to lead into May&#x27;s guitar solo. In live versions of this song, Taylor used Latin-influenced percussion with timbales on the News of the World Tour, and tightly tuned Remo Roto-Toms on the Jazz Tour, Crazy Tour, The Game and Hot Space tours.

The distinctive &#x27;psychedelic&#x27; sound effects heard in the song were not produced on a synthesiser, but on May&#x27;s Red Special and an Electroharmonix Frequency Analyzer pedal, which he would often do live. The studio cut made use of an Eventide Harmonizer. These sound effects, together with Mercury&#x27;s moans and groans, were expanded upon during live renditions of the song, the band taking an opportunity to show off the full potential of their stage lights and effects.

A more aggressive version of this song was covered by the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails as a B-side for the 1990 single, &quot;Sin&quot;. It was later added as a bonus track to the 2010 remastered edition of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;.

====&quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot;====
&quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot;, a blues excursion, was written and sung by May. It is the only song in their discography to be recorded (except for the vocals) in one take. Lyrically, it deals with an aspiring trumpet player&#x27;s career, delivered in a &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; fashion. May sings with an American accent and measures the aforementioned trumpet player&#x27;s success by &quot;bucks&quot; (dollars), as opposed to pounds or &quot;quid&quot;. On a close inspection, Deacon can be heard playing the wrong notes in some bass parts, and May can also be heard laughing at the end of the song. It is also one of the few Queen songs not to feature any vocals by Mercury, although he did perform lead vocals in live performances.

The band&#x27;s web site states they were unaware that they were being recorded, but May has cast doubt on the authenticity of this, though has confirmed the first take of the backing track was used.

====&quot;Who Needs You&quot;====
&quot;Who Needs You&quot; was a song written by Deacon, who, along with May, plays Spanish guitar. Mercury&#x27;s lead vocal is entirely panned on the right audio channel while the lead guitar is on the left channel. May also plays maracas and Mercury plays a cowbell. It has been described as a &quot;tentative reggae homage&quot;, albeit with &quot;Spanish rather than Jamaican guitars&quot;.

====&quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot;====

&quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot;, written by May, was his idea of treating a song as a three-act theatrical play. It makes use of the tapping technique.

====&quot;My Melancholy Blues&quot;====
&quot;My Melancholy Blues&quot; was composed by Mercury. There are no backing vocals or guitars. Deacon played fretless bass on stage during this song but used a regular fretted bass on the record.

==Artwork and packaging==

The album&#x27;s cover was a painting by American sci-fi artist Frank Kelly Freas. Taylor had an issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (October 1953) whose cover art depicted a giant intelligent robot holding the dead body of a man. The caption read: &quot;Please... fix it, Daddy?&quot; to illustrate the story &quot;The Gulf Between&quot; by Tom Godwin. The painting inspired the band to contact Freas, who agreed to alter the painting for their album cover, by replacing the single dead man with the four &quot;dead&quot; band members (with Mercury and May dead in the robot&#x27;s hand—Mercury bleeding from his chest and blood on the robot&#x27;s middle finger of its opposite hand—and with Taylor and Deacon falling to the ground, Taylor only visible on the back cover).

The inner cover (gatefold) has the robot extending its hand to snatch up the petrified fleeing audience in the shattered auditorium where the corpses were removed. Freas said he was a classical music fan and did not know Queen, and only listened to the band after doing the cover &quot;because I thought I might just hate them, and it would ruin my ideas&quot;, but eventually liked their music.

==Release==
===Singles===
*&quot;We Are the Champions&quot; was released as the first single from the album on 7 October 1977 in the UK, where it reached number 2. In the US it reached number 4.
*&quot;Spread Your Wings&quot; followed as the second single. Released in the UK on 10 February 1978, it reached number 34.
*&quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot; is the last single from the album; it was released in 1978, and only in the US, Canada, Japan and New Zealand. It only reached number 74 in the US, failing to chart everywhere else.

===Tour===
The News of the World Tour was a concert tour by Queen to promote the album. Queen played 26 shows in North America and 21 in Europe, beginning on 11 November 1977 in Portland, United States and concluding the tour on 13 May 1978 in London.

===Re-issues===
In May 2011, a remastered and expanded reissue of the album was released. This was part of a new record deal between Queen and Universal Music, which meant Queen&#x27;s association with EMI Records would come to an end after almost 40 years. According to Universal Music, all Queen albums would be remastered and reissued in 2011. This reissue included a deluxe edition which contains five additional tracks. The second batch of albums (the band&#x27;s middle five albums) was released in June 2011.

On 4 September 2017, Queen released a multi-format deluxe boxset marking the 40th anniversary of the album&#x27;s original issue by the Virgin EMI label. The set contains previously unreleased outtakes and rarities from the band&#x27;s archives, in the form of a newly created &quot;alternative&quot; version of the entire album, dubbed &quot;Raw Sessions&quot;. The boxset also includes a pure analogue vinyl LP, cut from the original analogue master mix tapes, and a brand new one-hour DVD documentary created from backstage material filmed during the North American leg of Queen&#x27;s 1977 News of the World Tour.

In promotion of the anniversary release, on 6 October Queen released the previously unheard &quot;Raw Sessions&quot; of &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. On 27 October, the band published on their official YouTube channel a new version of &quot;All Dead, All Dead&quot; with previously unheard lead vocals by Mercury, and was accompanied with an animated lyric video. The box set was officially released on 17 November 2017.

==Reception==
&quot;News of the World&quot; initially received mixed reviews, mostly reflecting on the album&#x27;s shift towards a more minimalist sound, and away from the band&#x27;s previous predominantly progressive rock sound. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commended the band&#x27;s experimentation within a range of hard rock to soft rock, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Bart Testa noted, &quot;Most of the songs on News of the World either challenge Queen&#x27;s artistic enemies or endeavor to establish a vision of the new order.&quot; He further dismissed the album as &quot;the salient fictions of which today&#x27;s Top Ten albums are made.&quot; For &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1977, Robert Christgau said that one side of the album is devoted to &quot;the futile rebelliousness of the doomed-to-life losers (those saps!) (you saps!) who buy and listen&quot;, while the other is devoted to songs about indecent women.

&quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; hailed it as the &quot;most intriguing Queen album since their finest, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;,&quot; commenting that &quot;whether all the obvious tension within the band will spur them on, or simply pull them apart, remains to be seen.&quot; Although &quot;Sounds&quot; dismissed side one as &quot;foreboding&quot;, they reacted positively to side two, particularly praising &quot;My Melancholy Blues&quot;. &quot;The Valley News&quot; criticised it as being &quot;tamer&quot; than the band&#x27;s first four albums, but concluded that &quot;Queen still pulls off top honors,&quot; particularly praising the production, Mercury&#x27;s vocals and May&#x27;s guitar work. In a mixed review, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; described &quot;News&quot; as &quot;Queen stripped down to almost basics...it&#x27;s not a bad album by any means, but it could have been better.&quot;

Retrospective reviews of the album have been generally positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the eclecticism in comparison to &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, describing it as &quot;an explosion of styles that didn&#x27;t seem to hold to any particular center.&quot; He praised May&#x27;s contributions for giving the album &quot;some lightness&quot;, and concluded that &quot;when it works, it&#x27;s massive, earth-shaking rock &amp; roll, the sound of a band beginning to revel in its superstardom.&quot; In &quot;Creem&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual poll, readers voted &quot;News of the World&quot; as the 19th best album of 1977. BBC Music&#x27;s Daryl Easlea said that the album is an exceptional showcase of &quot;Queen&#x27;s unerring ability to sound absolutely like no-other group – even when parodying other musical styles&quot;. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the album a generally positive rating, and observed that Queen had &quot;ventured deeper into stadium rock&quot;, while Brendan Schroer of Sputnikmusic also noted the relation to stadium rock, calling it &quot;the great arena rock wonder&quot; with very few flaws.

The 40th anniversary release prompted several more reviews, with David Chiu of &quot;The Quietus&quot; calling it &quot;a work that had swagger and attitude&quot;, while &quot;Loudersound&quot; wrote that &quot;Despite damping down their instincts so punks wouldn&#x27;t spit at them, they still sound like flamboyance has burst through the wall, riding a Harley and wearing a tiara.&quot; Several publications have hailed it as the one of the band&#x27;s greatest albums. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it as the best Queen album, describing it as &quot;their sharpest, surest set&quot;, while Christopher Thelen of the &quot;Daily Vault&quot; praised it for being &quot;the best mixture of musical styles they had ever achieved&quot; and Queen&#x27;s &quot;creative peak&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The album as a whole has been released on Super Audio CD. In 2012, the TV show &quot;Family Guy&quot; dedicated an episode plot line to the album cover, in which Stewie Griffin is frightened of the cover. Show creator Seth MacFarlane stated that it was based on his own fear of the cover when he was a child.

Marvel paid tribute to &quot;News of the World&quot; on a variant cover of &quot;X-Men Gold&quot; #11. The cover, by artist Mike del Mundo, depicts a Sentinel holding Old Man Logan and Kitty Pryde as Colossus plummets to the ground.

The giant robot from the album cover, also known as &quot;Frank&quot;, was used as a special effect during the songs &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;Killer Queen&quot; for the 2017–18 Queen + Adam Lambert Tour, which was in celebration of the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

<doc id="308428" wikidata="Q188454" url="?curid=308428" title="Yamaha Corporation">
<text>is a Japanese musical instrument and audio equipment manufacturer.

It is one of the constituents of Nikkei 225 and is the world&#x27;s largest musical instrument manufacturing company.

The former motorcycle division was established in 1955 as Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd., which started as an affiliated company but has been spun-off as its own independent company.

== History ==

 was established in 1887 as a reed organ manufacturer by Torakusu Yamaha () in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, and was incorporated on 12 October 1897. In 1900, the company manufactured the first piano to be made in Japan, and its first grand piano two years later. In 1987, 100 years after the first reed organ built by Yamaha, the company was renamed Yamaha Corporation in honor of its founder. The company&#x27;s origins as a musical instrument manufacturer are still reflected today in the group&#x27;s logo—a trio of interlocking tuning forks.

After World War II, company president Genichi Kawakami repurposed the remains of the company&#x27;s war-time production machinery and the company&#x27;s expertise in metallurgical technologies to the manufacture of motorcycles. The YA-1 (AKA Akatombo, the &quot;Red Dragonfly&quot;), of which 125 were built in the first year of production (1954), was named in honour of the founder. It was a 125cc, single cylinder, two-stroke street bike patterned after the German DKW RT 125 (which the British munitions firm, BSA, had also copied in the post-war era and manufactured as the Bantam and Harley-Davidson as the Hummer). In 1955, the success of the YA-1 resulted in the founding of Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd., splitting the motorcycle division from the company. Also, in 1954 the Yamaha Music School was founded.

Yamaha has grown into the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of musical instruments (including pianos, &quot;silent&quot; pianos, drums, guitars, brass instruments, woodwinds, violins, violas, cellos, and vibraphones), and a leading manufacturer of semiconductors, audio/visual, computer-related products, sporting goods, home appliances, specialty metals, and industrial robots. Yamaha released the Yamaha CS-80 in 1977.

In 1983, Yamaha made the first commercially successful digital synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7.

In 1988, Yamaha shipped the world&#x27;s first CD recorder. Yamaha purchased Sequential Circuits in 1988. It bought a majority stake (51%) of competitor Korg in 1987, which was bought out by Korg in 1993.
In the late 1990s, Yamaha released a series of portable battery operated keyboards under the PSS and the PSR range of keyboards. The Yamaha PSS-14 and PSS-15 keyboards were upgrades to the Yamaha PSS-7 with short demo songs, short selectable phrases, and sound effects.

In 2002, Yamaha closed its archery product business that was started in 1959. Six archers in five different Olympic Games won gold medals using their products.

In January 2005, it acquired German audio software manufacturer Steinberg from Pinnacle Systems. In July 2007, Yamaha bought out the minority shareholding of the Kemble family in Yamaha-Kemble Music (UK) Ltd, Yamaha&#x27;s UK import and musical instrument and professional audio equipment sales division. It was renamed Yamaha Music U.K. Ltd in late 2007. Kemble &amp; Co. Ltd, the UK piano sales &amp; manufacturing arm, was unaffected.

On 20 December 2007, Yamaha made an agreement with the Austrian Bank BAWAG PSK Gruppe to purchase all the shares of Bösendorfer, with Yamaha intending to continue manufacturing at the Bösendorfer facilities in Austria. The acquisition was announced on 28 January 2008, after the NAMM Show in Los Angeles. As of 1 February 2008, Bösendorfer Klavierfabrik GmbH operates as a subsidiary of Yamaha Corporation.

Yamaha electronics have proven to be successful, popular, and respected products. For example, the Yamaha YPG-625 was awarded &quot;Keyboard of the Year&quot; and &quot;Product of the Year&quot; in 2007 from &quot;The Music and Sound Retailer&quot; magazine. Other noteworthy Yamaha electronics include the SHS-10 Keytar, a consumer-priced keytar which offered MIDI output features normally found on much more expensive keyboards.

==Business segments==
Yamaha is segmented into three primary business domains of musical instruments, audio equipment, and others (industrial machinery and components, etc.)

* Musical Instruments – the manufacture and sales of pianos; digital musical instruments; wind, string, and percussion instruments; and other music-related activities.
** Pianos
** Digital Musical Instruments
** Winds, Strings/Percussion
** Guitars
* Audio Equipment – the manufacture and sales of audio products, professional audio equipment, information and telecommunication equipment, and certain other products.
** Consumer
*** Yamaha Home Audio
** B2B
*** Yamaha Pro Audio
*** Yamaha Unified Communications, Inc.

* Industrial Machinery and Components (IMC) &amp; others – electronic devices business, automobile interior wood components, factory automation (FA) equipment, golf products and a resort business.

=== Living room business ===
The company began by manufacturing high-end furniture based on its expertise in wood processing for piano manufacturing, and was spun off into a separate company in 1991 with the establishment of YAMAHA Livingtec (YLT). The company manufactured and sold unit baths, system kitchens, and other products. In 1992, the company decided to stop selling system furniture, and after narrowing down its product lineup, it terminated orders and production in 2005 March.

In 2010, Yamaha sold its 85.1% stake in YLT to Japan Industrial Partners and three foreign investment funds as part of a restructuring. At this point, the YAMAHA brand and company name continued, but the company essentially withdrew from management. Subsequently, YLT conducted a MBO of the investments of Yamaha and the investment funds, and the company name was changed as of 1 October 2013 and withdrew from the housing equipment business in both name and reality.

=== Synthesizers and samplers ===

Yamaha announced the singing synthesizer Vocaloid for the first time at the German fair Musikmesse on 5–9 March 2003.

Yamaha began the sale and production of Vocaloid applications, starting with Lily which was later sold via Internet Co., Ltd.&#x27;s website. Their involvement continued with the VY series, with VY1 being the first, released in deluxe and standard editions on 1 September 2010. The VY series is a series designed to be a high quality product for professional musicians. The series is also designed with the intention to set a new standard for the Vocaloids for having no face, sex, or set voice, but are designed to complete any song. VY1 has a new approach to how the software handled the database of samples and improved the performance of the Vocaloid 2 engine.

Yamaha announced a version of the Vocaloid 2 software for the iPhone and iPad, which exhibited at the Y2 Autumn 2010 Digital Content Expo in Japan. Later, this version of the software was released using the VY1 voice. VY2 will also be released for this version of the software.

<doc id="308430" wikidata="Q373267" url="?curid=308430" title="The Faculty">
<text>The Faculty is a 1998 American science fiction horror film directed and edited by Robert Rodriguez with a screenplay by Kevin Williamson. It stars Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Laura Harris, Josh Hartnett, Shawn Hatosy, Famke Janssen, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth, Robert Patrick, Usher Raymond, Jon Stewart, and Elijah Wood.

The film was theatrically released on December 25, 1998, by Miramax Films through Dimension Films. It grossed $63.2 million and has developed a cult following since its release.

==Plot==
One evening at Herrington High School in Ohio, teachers and Principal Drake leave after discussing the school&#x27;s budget. When Drake returns to retrieve her keys, she is attacked by the school&#x27;s football coach, Joe Willis. Drama teacher Mrs. Olson emotionlessly stabs Drake with scissors as she flees the school.

The following morning, the students arrive, including Casey Connor, the dedicated but perpetually harassed photographer for the school newspaper. Casey is the unappreciated assistant to spiteful Delilah Profitt, the paper&#x27;s editor-in-chief and head cheerleader. Delilah&#x27;s mistreated boyfriend Stan Rosado is contemplating quitting the football team to pursue academics. Zeke Tyler is an intelligent yet rebellious student repeating his senior year. Zeke sells, among other illegal items, a powdery ecstasy-like drug he distributes hidden in ballpoint pens. He is confronted by teacher Elizabeth Burke, who expresses concern for him over his illegal activities. Naive transfer student Marybeth Louise Hutchinson befriends self-styled outcast Stokely Mitchell, who has deliberately spread rumors that she is a lesbian though she has a crush on Stan. Marybeth develops a crush on Zeke which is reciprocated.

Casey finds a strange creature on the football field and takes it to science teacher Mr. Furlong, who believes it is a new species of cephalopod-specific parasite called a mesozoan. Delilah and Casey hide in the teachers&#x27; lounge to find a story. They witness Coach Willis and Ms. Olson forcing one of the parasites into the ear of the school nurse. They also find the body of another teacher, Mrs. Brummel. Casey and Delilah flee, and Casey calls the police, but his claims are dismissed.

The next day, Casey tells Delilah, Stan, and Stokely he believes the teachers are being controlled by aliens. After Zeke and Marybeth tease them about their theory, Mr. Furlong attempts to infect them. Zeke injects his homemade drugs into Furlong&#x27;s eye, killing him. Zeke takes the five to his house, where he experiments on a specimen retrieved by Casey. He discovers it needs water to survive and can be killed by his &quot;drug&quot;, revealed to actually be raw, powdered caffeine (as caffeine acts to dehydrate the user, and the aliens are hyper-sensitive to hydration of both themselves and their host). Zeke makes everyone take his drug to prove they are uninfected. Delilah is revealed as infected and she destroys Zeke&#x27;s lab and most of his drug supply before escaping.

Acting on Stokely&#x27;s speculation that killing the alien queen will revert everyone to normal, the group returns to the school, where their football team is playing and infecting opposing players. Believing Principal Drake to be the queen, they isolate her in the gym and fatally shoot her. Stan confronts the coach and team to see if the plan worked, but becomes infected himself. Zeke and Casey retrieve more of Zeke&#x27;s drugs from his car. Casey leads infected students away from Zeke, who encounters Miss Burke in the parking lot and incapacitates her.

At the gym, Marybeth reveals herself to be the alien queen; earlier on, she faked taking the drug. Casey and Stokely flee to the swimming pool, where Stokely is injured and becomes infected. Zeke and Casey hide in the locker room, where Marybeth reverts to her human disguise. She explains she is taking over Earth because her planet is dying. Marybeth transforms back into her true form and hurls Zeke across the room into the lockers, knocking him out. Casey seizes the drug and traps the queen behind retracting bleachers. Just as the queen infects him, he stabs the drug into her eye, killing her and halting his infection. Casey returns to the locker room and finds Stokely and Zeke alive.

One month later, everyone has returned to normal. Stan and Stokely, who has shed her Goth girl image, are now dating. Zeke has taken Stan&#x27;s place on the football team, while Miss Burke affectionately watches him practice. Delilah, no longer vindictive, is now dating Casey, who is considered a local hero as various news media reveal the attempted alien invasion is now public knowledge, even as the FBI denies it.

==Cast==

==Production==
In 1990, David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel wrote their first draft of the script and sent it out, but there were no buyers. It wasn&#x27;t until after the success of &quot;Scream&quot; (1996) that Miramax Films bought the script and rushed it into production. Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein brought in Kevin Williamson to do rewrites, keeping the basic story, but rewriting the dialogue and adding new characters to make it more &quot;hip&quot;. Originally, Williamson was set to direct the film, but he chose not to so he could direct his self-penned script &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; (1999). The Weinsteins brought in Robert Rodriguez to direct the film instead.

&quot;The Faculty&quot; takes place in the fictional town of Herrington, Ohio, but was shot in Austin, San Marcos, Dallas, and Lockhart, Texas. In a retrospective interview, Clea Duvall said the making of the film &quot;was so much fun. It was mostly night shoots, so it was like we were in this alternate universe. Working all night long and making this fun sci-fi horror movie. I loved it.&quot;

==Music==


The score is composed by Marco Beltrami, who had previously scored the teen-slasher-horror film, &quot;Scream&quot;, as well as &quot;Mimic&quot; (1997). Both Beltrami&#x27;s score and songs by various artists used in the film were released as albums. The &quot;music from the motion picture&quot; album features songs by various indie and alternative rock groups.

On March 7, 2023, the label Intrada released Beltrami&#x27;s complete score for the movie.

==Release==
===Home media===
Several scenes involving an additional character named Venus, played by Kidada Jones, were shown in TV previews for the film, as well as in Tommy Hilfiger promotional commercials for the movie, but her scenes were cut from the final film. She is visible in a scene in the theatrical version, standing next to Gabe (Usher) in Mr. Furlong&#x27;s (Jon Stewart) science class when they are looking at the &quot;new species&quot; in the aquarium.

&quot;The Faculty&quot; was released in several countries on Blu-ray, such as Canada, on October 6, 2009, by Alliance; in Australia on September 1, 2011, by Reel; in the United Kingdom on October 3, 2011, by Lionsgate, in Germany on October 6, 2011, by Studio Canal; in France on January 10, 2012, by Studio Canal; and in the United States on July 31, 2012, by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. Lionsgate re-issued the Blu-ray version in the United States on October 7, 2014, after Echo Bridge lost the rights to the Miramax films. Home media for &quot;The Faculty&quot; do not include traditional extras provided for other Robert Rodriguez films, such as a &quot;10 Minute Film School&quot; feature, audio commentary, and making-of featurettes.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Faculty&quot; was viewed on 2,365 screens on its opening weekend, debuting at No. 5 in the US and making $11,633,495. Its eventual US gross was $40.3 million. Its debut below commercial expectations has been partly credited to the studio&#x27;s decision to release the movie on Christmas Day, a time when audiences are likelier to watch traditional dramas or feel-good fare.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Faculty&quot; holds an approval rating of 57% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 5.70/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus called the film a &quot;Rip-off of other sci-fi thrillers.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Positive reviews at the time praised Kevin Williamson&#x27;s self-aware script and trademark meta humor that included references to iconic science-fiction films. In a review for &quot;Variety&quot;, Dennis Harvey wrote, &quot;&quot;The Faculty&quot; works hard at mixing a canny cocktail of cineastic in-jokes, affectionate teenploitation and high-octane suspense that&#x27;s as enjoyable as it is impossible to take seriously.&quot; Harvey added that Williamson and Robert Rodriguez combine to &quot;make a complete lack of socially redeeming value seem so much fun that &quot;&#x27;The Faculty&quot;&#x27; might well become a pulp classic&quot;. Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot; called the film &quot;subversive&quot; and said &quot;its honest, good-natured junkiness… feels like a relief&quot;. He appreciated the film&#x27;s homages to genre movies including &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976), &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1978) and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986) while also citing the character of Stokely as the standout amongst the teen archetypes.

Michael Sauter of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a grade of B− and expressed a wish that the film had used the faculty characters more. In contrast, Tom Sinclair, also of &quot;EW&quot;, gave the film a C+ and said Williamson has become &quot;too invested in the earnestness of teen angst to portray it in the scathing parodistic terms a hip horror movie demands&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a mostly negative review but praised the cast. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; awarded the film 3.5 stars and said, &quot;While it may suffer a bit from excess character clutter (nearly 10 major characters throughout), it&#x27;s nonetheless a slam-bang, sci-fi actioner, relentlessly paced and edited, with a pounding soundtrack and some ingenious aliens courtesy of Bernie Wrightson and KNB Effects.&quot;

===Retrospective===
In subsequent years, various critics have written about &quot;The Faculty&quot; impact. Aliya Whiteley wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s all about examining the tropes of science fiction with a smart, funny angle. Half of the fun in this film is in identifying where you first came across a certain character&#x27;s name or saw a particular special effect. For instance, there&#x27;s a brilliant moment with a head on legs that I defy you to watch and not think of a certain John Carpenter film.&quot; Whiteley concluded, &quot;&quot;The Faculty&quot; is very definitely a big mess of a movie. But if you love all things sci-fi, it&#x27;s a good mess.&quot; Keith Phipps described the film as &quot;a Kevin Williamson-scripted high-school variation on &quot;Invasion Of The Body Snatchers&quot;.&quot; Haleigh Foutch considered it one of the most iconic 1990s teen horror films: &quot;Yet another win from 90s teen screenwriter in chief Kevin Williamson, &quot;The Faculty&quot; fused Williamson&#x27;s knack for snappy teen drama with Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s subversive camp to fantastic results. It&#x27;s smart without ever taking itself too seriously and campy without ever losing its cool, drawing proudly from the tradition of classic alien invasion movies and casting them in the 90s teen tradition.&quot;

===Cast and director&#x27;s reception===
In a series of interviews, several &quot;The Faculty&quot; cast members reflected on their experiences with the film and its surprising journey to cult status. Robert Rodriguez, the director, shared that he had been drawn to &quot;The Faculty&quot; because of his love for genre-mixed films, even though he knew this would limit the movie&#x27;s initial audience. He admitted that while the film did not perform as expected at the time, it had gained a strong following over the years: &quot;I’ve never heard people talk so enthusiastically about &quot;The Faculty&quot; until the last couple of years.&quot; Rodriguez also recalled his casting process, highlighting how actors like Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett stood out. He believed the film’s original title, &quot;The Faculty&quot;, did not resonate with younger audiences, suggesting titles like &quot;Alienated&quot; or &quot;The Others&quot;, which the studio later used for another movie.

Jordana Brewster reflected on the contrast between &quot;The Faculty&quot; and &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, noting that they expected &quot;The Faculty&quot; to be a massive hit due to the success of teen movies, such as &quot;Scream&quot;, at the time. She recalled thinking it would make them huge stars: “We all thought we were gonna be these huge teen stars... but it didn’t quite work out that way.” Despite the film’s initial underperformance, she is now proud of its cult status, which she finds &quot;cool&quot;.

Clea DuVall also discussed the film’s initial reception, noting that it did not have the impact they expected during its release, despite the popularity of Kevin Williamson’s work at the time. However, she has been pleased to see &quot;The Faculty&quot;’s lasting influence: &quot;It’s cool to see the legs that movie has had.&quot; She acknowledged that people still recognize her as Stokely, the character she portrayed, which continues to be a huge part of her legacy: &quot;I feel like that is the number one thing that people come up to me and say or recognize me from still.&quot; DuVall mentioned that while she does not fully understand why the film did not perform better initially, she believes that broader cultural conversations may be partly responsible for its rediscovery.

Elijah Wood described his experience on &quot;The Faculty&quot; as one of his most memorable. He said, &quot;For all around experience, I would say &quot;The Faculty&quot; because the crew was so amazing. [Robert Rodriguez] was amazing to work with. There aren&#x27;t enough adjectives to describe how cool it was working with him.&quot; He went on to emphasize the fun and unique atmosphere on set, stating, &quot;It was so fun getting a chance to work with Robert, who had a very different approach than any other director that I&#x27;d worked with.&quot; Wood also highlighted the close-knit environment, noting, &quot;There was a lot of love on the set. We&#x27;re all really close, so it was cool.&quot;

===Analysis===
The film has been praised for its portrayal of teenage alienation, especially within the high school environment and its system of cliques and social roles. In particular, the alien invasion through parasitized bodies has been recognized as functioning as a metaphor for those concepts, reflecting the fear of losing one&#x27;s nascent individuality to a crowd. The alien queen encapsulates this by offering the heroes a world without alienation or differences, in which &quot;everything that is both wonderful and awful about being a teenager is done away in favor of blind allegiance&quot;.

Experts also noted in &quot;The Faculty&quot; a reinvention of the fear of female sexuality often found in the horror genre. The character of Marybeth, the alien queen, is &quot;a complex imbrication of woman, alien and power&quot; that acts beyond the role of femme fatale. She masquerades as a virginal, unassuming girl clad in floral dresses, but at the final battle she reveals her true sexual threat, becoming nude by her alien transformation and turning confident and flirtatious. Her role as a threatening, castrating agent is underlined by the sharp teeth of her species, which evoke a vagina dentata, and their association to water, the archaic, womb-like female element. As the monstrous mother of her race, she tries to seduce the heroes by offering them a symbolic return to the womb. As Sharon Packer and Jody Pennington put it:

The image on the screen is dual: we see the beautiful, young, naked Marybeth strolling around looking for Casey, and the shadow of the monstrous form in the walls. Marybeth delivers a speech which ties the elements of the movie together. It is about the &quot;world&quot; she came from and its promises of &quot;paradise&quot; for lost and lonely humans, trapped in high-school &quot;hell&quot;.

The character of Miss Burke precedes Marybeth in the same line, revealing her hidden sexuality only after being infected and turned into a monster. The scene of her detached, tentacled head in particular echoes the Freudian Medusa head. The monstrous feminine is therefore used in the film to reflect the teenage characters entering adult world, where they are forced to &quot;come to terms with female sexuality and overcome their fear of its &#x27;monstrous&#x27; aspects in order to become fully functioning adults&quot;. Casey, the male character closest to his softer, feminine side, is the final hero of the film.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for a total of eight awards, including an ALMA Award for director Robert Rodriguez, 2 Saturn Awards, 2 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and 3 Teen Choice Awards, but did not win any.
==Remake==

In January 2025, it was reported that a script for a remake was in the works by &quot;Companion&quot; (2025) writer-director Drew Hancock. Rodriguez is set to produce, along with Miramax and BoulderLight Pictures.

<text>The Navy and Marine Corps Medal is the highest non-combat decoration awarded for heroism by the United States Department of the Navy to members of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. The medal was established by an act of Congress on 7 August 1942, and is authorized under .

The Navy and Marine Corps Medal is the equivalent of the Army&#x27;s Soldier&#x27;s Medal, the Air and Space Forces&#x27; Airman&#x27;s Medal, and the Coast Guard Medal.

==Criteria==
As the senior non-combat award for heroism, this award hinges on the actual level of personal &quot;life threatening&quot; risk experienced by the awardee. For heroic performance to rise to this level it must be clearly established that the act involved very specific life-threatening risk to the awardee.

During the mid-20th century, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal has been awarded instead of the Silver or Gold Lifesaving Medal, for sea rescues involving risk to life. This is due primarily to the creation of a variety of additional military decorations that are often considered more prestigious than the Lifesaving Medal.

Additional awards of the medal are denoted by gold or silver inch stars.

The Navy and Marine Corps Medal was first bestowed during World War II. However, the medal was awarded retroactively for actions that predated its establishment, &quot;to any person to whom the Secretary of the Navy, before August 7, 1942, awarded a letter of commendation for heroism, and who applies for that medal, regardless of the date of the act of heroism.&quot;

==Appearance==
The Navy and Marine Corps Medal is an octagonal bronze medal. The obverse depicts an eagle holding a fouled anchor over a globe. The word &quot;Heroism&quot; is inscribed below the globe. The ribbon of the medal is three equal stripes of navy blue, old gold, and apple red.

==Notable recipients==
*Barbara O. Barnwell - First female Marine awarded the medal, which she was awarded on August 7, 1953, for saving a fellow Marine from drowning. 
*Carl Brashear, USN, Navy Master Diver
*Charles Jackson French, USN, Mess Attendant 2nd Class
*John F. Kennedy, USN – President of the United States who was awarded the medal as commanding officer of Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109 during World War II.
*Don Shipley, USN, Former Navy SEAL and Stolen valor activist
*Britt K. Slabinski, USN, Medal of Honor recipient, Navy SEAL
*James E. Williams, USN, Medal of Honor recipient, Vietnam War

<doc id="308435" wikidata="Q4835233" url="?curid=308435" title="The Ice Storm (novel)">
<text>The Ice Storm is a 1994 American novel by Rick Moody. The novel was widely acclaimed by readers and critics alike, described as a funny, acerbic, and moving hymn to a dazed and confused era of American life.

In 1997, the novel was adapted into an acclaimed feature film directed by Ang Lee.

==Plot summary==
The novel takes place over Thanksgiving weekend 1973, during a dangerous ice storm, and centers on two neighboring families, the Hoods and the Williamses, and their difficulties in dealing with the tumultuous political and social climate of the day. The setting is an affluent Connecticut suburb during the height of the sexual revolution. The novel is narrated by four members of the two families, each promoting his or her view of complications that arise throughout the novel. 

The Hood family members are Ben, Elena, Paul and Wendy, and the Williamses are Jim, Janey, Mikey, and Sandy. The Hood family is overridden with lies. Ben is currently having an affair with his married neighbor Janey. His wife Elena is alienated. Her daughter ventures into sexual liaisons with both females and males, including her neighbors Mikey and Sandy. The story focuses on the 24 hours in which a major ice storm strikes the town of New Canaan, just as both families are melting down from the parents&#x27; alcoholism, escapism and adultery, and their children&#x27;s recreational drug use and sexual experimentation.

==Characters==
*Ben Hood
*Elena Hood
*Paul Hood
*Wendy Hood
*Janey Williams
*Jim Williams
*Mikey Williams
*Sandy Williams

==Themes and analysis==
The novel explores the loss of innocence and moral compass in upper-middle class Americans. Its themes find their reflection in the setting: the 1970s at the time of the Watergate scandal in the wake of the sexual revolution. Themes include secrets, permissiveness, vulnerability, betrayal, and absence. Youthful characters engage in sexual experimentation as their parents pursue affairs and otherwise absent themselves from their lives. The rapidly changing sexual mores of the period are reflected in the lives of both families, whose members experiment with traditionally taboo acts such as suicide and adultery.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Ice Storm&quot; was largely commended for its audacity and the many daring subjects explored in the novel. Critic Adam Begley of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the novel: &quot;A bitter and loving and damning tribute to the American family... This is a good book, packed with keen observation and sympathy for human failure&quot; while &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;one of the wittiest books about family life ever written.&quot; Amanda Heller of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; stated &quot;Moody brings this profusion of metaphor to order with a fierce, subversive intelligence. His characters, drawn with a manic acuity that isn&#x27;t fully accounted for until the end, stay with us long after we&#x27;ve finished reading.&quot;

The novel was a moderate success commercially; however its sales were boosted in 1997 with the release of the film adaptation.

==Film adaptation==

The film adaptation &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; featured a cast including Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire and Elijah Wood. The film was a &quot;succès d&#x27;estime&quot; as an art house film and critically acclaimed despite a poor box office; however, it gained a modest reception on subsequent home video releases. While remaining more or less faithful to the book, some details were changed. Most notably, Weaver and Jamey Sheridan&#x27;s characters were named Janey and Jim Carver, while in Moody&#x27;s book, their surname was Williams.

==Impact==
The author Junot Díaz claims to have received the idea for the deep structure for &quot;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&quot; from this book.

<doc id="308436" wikidata="Q2861662" url="?curid=308436" title="Arliss (TV series)">
<text>Arliss (rendered in its logo as Arli$$) is an American dark comedy series, created by and starring Robert Wuhl (who was also the series&#x27; showrunner), about the glitzy, big-money world of professional sports, with Wuhl playing the eternally optimistic and endlessly resourceful L.A. sports agent Arliss Michaels, whose Achilles&#x27; heel is his inability to say &quot;no&quot; to clients and employees. &quot;Arliss&quot; ran for seven seasons and 80 episodes on HBO, from August 10, 1996, to September 8, 2002. After almost two decades off the air, the entire catalog of &quot;Arliss&quot; episodes returned to Max in a streaming format in 2022.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called the show &quot;One of the freshest shows to come along in a while.&quot; It was well-known for taking on very controversial (at the time) topics, including point shaving, political corruption, personal seat license fees, relocation of professional sports teams, sports in the Las Vegas metropolitan area, right to work law states, domestic abuse, steroid use, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, gay and transgender athletes, alcoholism, and unwanted athlete pregnancies.

The idea behind &quot;Arliss&quot; was to show the hype, greed, and hypocrisy of powerful sports agents like Arliss Michaels, and what really happens &quot;behind the scenes&quot; in professional sports. In a 2018 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Wuhl said the idea for &quot;Arliss&quot; was based on the book &quot;&quot; by Donald Trump and journalist Tony Schwartz:

I had read &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot; and I thought, &quot;This is total, 100 percent bullshit. He&#x27;s saying stuff that I don&#x27;t believe a fuckin&#x27; word of it. He&#x27;s telling you what happened, but I want to see what really happened.&quot; We can use this, as Arliss the sports agent, telling you what happens and then prove he&#x27;s full of shit and show what really happened.

Over 400 celebrities had cameo appearances on &quot;Arliss&quot;, including Les Moonves, George Wallace, Bobcat Goldthwait, Shannon Elizabeth, Fred Williamson, Al Michaels, John Elway, Derek Jeter, Dan Marino, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Warren Moon, Alonzo Mourning, Bob Costas, Jimmy Johnson, Jerry Jones, Picabo Street, Katarina Witt, and Barry Bonds.

==Cast==
* Robert Wuhl as Arliss Michaels, the president of a sports agency, who tries to cater to his clients&#x27; every need as best he can
* Sandra Oh as Rita Wu, Arliss&#x27;s personal assistant
* Jim Turner as Kirby Carlisle, a middle-aged ex-football star
* Michael Boatman as Stanley Babson, a conservative financial advisor

==Series overview==

==Critical reception==
&quot;Arliss&quot; has a 72/100 rating on Metacritic, and 62% on Rotten Tomatoes. The popular show, which ran for seven seasons, has been cited as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for future HBO shows such as &quot;Ballers&quot; and &quot;Entourage&quot;, and as an example of how premium cable networks manage their programming. A number of HBO subscribers cited &quot;Arliss&quot; as the sole reason that they paid for the network, and as a result, its fan base was able to keep the show on the air for a lengthy run. The show frequently used obscure sports references, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; repeatedly called it one of the worst shows on television; sportswriter Bill Simmons (who later worked for HBO under his digital banner &quot;The Ringer&quot;) used &quot;Arliss&quot; as an example of what he saw as a lack of good fictional shows about sports.

<doc id="308441" wikidata="Q1422734" url="?curid=308441" title="USS Michigan (SSGN-727)">
<text>USS &quot;Michigan&quot; (SSBN-727/SSGN-727) is an nuclear-powered guided missile submarine (SSGN), converted from a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), that is part of the United States Navy. She is the third vessel to bear the name of the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Michigan&quot; was constructed at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, and was commissioned on 11 September 1982. &quot;Michigan&quot; arrived in Bangor, Washington, on 16 March 1983 and completed sixty-six Strategic Deterrent Patrols. She was originally designed and commissioned as a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) capable of deploying 24 Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) with nuclear warheads.

== Conversion to SSGN ==

As of June 2007, &quot;Michigan&quot; has been converted to an SSGN at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Her hull classification symbol then changed from SSBN-727 to SSGN-727.

== Post-conversion ==

On 12 December 2009, &quot;Michigan&quot; returned to Naval Base Kitsap, her home base, completing her first deployment after the SSGN conversion. The deployment began 10 November 2008, and included numerous missions. The boat also completed several theater security cooperation engagements with Pacific Rim nations.

On 28 June 2010, &quot;Michigan&quot; was one of three &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines involved in a US response to Chinese missile testing in the contested East China Sea. &quot;Michigan&quot;, , and all surfaced simultaneously in the waters of South Korea, the Philippines, and the British Indian Ocean Territory respectively.

In August 2016, CSC Dominique Saavedra embarked aboard &quot;Michigan&quot; and became the first enlisted female sailor to have earned her submarine qualification serving on a U.S. Navy submarine, the first boat specially modified with separate accommodations for enlisted female crew. (The first female, both officer and overall was in 2011.)

On 25 April 2017, &quot;Michigan&quot; docked at Busan Naval Base, South Korea, during a time of heightened tensions with North Korea. She later joined the USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; Carrier Strike Group in the Sea of Japan for exercises. Photographs show a dry deck shelter mounted on &quot;Michigan&quot;.

&quot;Michigan&quot; returned to Busan Naval Base, South Korea on 15 June 2023, the day after North Korea fired two short-range missiles off its east coast. The visual display of the submarine - again with a mounted dry deck shelter - was done to demonstrate the US resolve to support and protect South Korea against North Korea&#x27;s recent aggression.

<doc id="308445" wikidata="Q122474" url="?curid=308445" title="Skywriting">
<text>Skywriting is the process of using one or more small aircraft, able to expel special smoke during flight, to fly in certain patterns that create writing readable from the ground. These messages can be advertisements, general messages of celebration or goodwill, personal messages such as a marriage proposals and birthday wishes, or acts of protest.

==Description==
The typical smoke generator consists of a pressurized container of viscous oil, such as Chevron/Texaco &quot;Canopus 13&quot; (formerly &quot;Corvus Oil&quot;). The oil is injected into the hot exhaust manifold, vaporizing it into a huge volume of dense white smoke.

Relatively few pilots have the skills to skywrite legibly. Also, wake turbulence and wind disperse and shear the smoke, causing the writing to blur and twist, usually within a few minutes. For these reasons, computer-controlled &quot;skytyping&quot; has been developed where multiple small aircraft, flying in line abreast formation, write in dot-matrix fashion, creating messages that can be much longer, and legible for longer periods, than those of traditional skywriting.

==History==
The beginnings of skywriting are disputed. In a 1926 letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Albert T. Reid wrote:

:A newspaper paragraph says skywriting was perfected in England in 1919 and used in the United States the next year. But Art Smith, who succeeded Beachey in flying exhibitions at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915, after the latter had been killed, did skywriting, always ending his breathtaking stunts by writing &quot;Good night.&quot; This was not a trial exhibition, but a part of every flight, and was always witnessed by thousands.

Major Jack Savage, former British Royal Air Force pilot and a writer for &quot;Flight&quot; magazine, had a successful skywriting fleet of Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 aircraft in England. He flew throughout the 1920s and 1930s, bringing the practice to America as well. The first recorded use of skywriting for advertising purposes was over the Derby at Epsom Downs Racecourse in the United Kingdom in May 1922, when Royal Air Force Captain Cyril Turner wrote &quot;Daily Mail&quot; above the track. In the United States, the first use of skywriting in advertising followed on November 28, 1922, over Times Square in New York City during a visit of Savage and Cyril Turner. Turner, a Royal Air Force pilot, spelled out &quot;Hello USA&quot;, followed by &quot;Call Vanderbilt 7200&quot; (the telephone number for the Vanderbilt Hotel, which received 47,000 phone calls in the next three hours).

Commercial skywriting in the United States developed in 1932 by Sid Pike, president of the Skywriting Corporation of America. One of their first major clients was Pepsi-Cola, which used skywriting to reach a mass market. Pepsi contracted a tremendous number of flights, including 2,225 in 1940.

Artists have also used skywriting as a visual medium. Skywriter Wayne Mansfield created aerial messages for John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and appeared as a sky artist over the Biennale in Venice, Italy. Artist Vik Muniz used skywriting for his &quot;Pictures of Clouds&quot; project.

== Skytyping ==

In 1946 the Skywriting Corporation purchased a fleet of surplus World War II planes and developed &quot;dot matrix skywriting&quot;, subsequently known as &quot;skytyping&quot;. The process uses five planes, flying in line abreast formation, releasing puffs of smoke under computer control, similar to characters produced by dot-matrix printers. These messages, written at , can be up to tall and over long. Traditional skywriting messages are limited to and take much longer to write (1–2 minutes/character, vs. 2–5 seconds/character with skytyping), limiting messages to no more than a few words before the smoke disperses. 

== Banner towing ==

Another form of skywriting is using an aircraft to tow a banner, a medium that has been popular in the United States for decades. It is usually practiced in coastal areas, where aircraft can fly at low levels past crowded beaches. Banner towing is a popular way to make a romantic marriage proposal.

<text>A bronchus ( ; : bronchi, ) is a passage or airway in the lower respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs. The first or primary bronchi to branch from the trachea at the carina are the right main bronchus and the left main bronchus. These are the widest bronchi, and enter the right lung, and the left lung at each hilum. The main bronchi branch into narrower secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi or segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.
The bronchi, when too narrow to be supported by cartilage, are known as bronchioles. No gas exchange takes place in the bronchi.

==Structure==
The trachea (windpipe) divides at the carina into two main or primary bronchi, the left bronchus and the right bronchus. The carina of the trachea is located at the level of the sternal angle and the fifth thoracic vertebra (at rest).

The right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left main bronchus, its mean length is 1.09 cm. It enters the root of the right lung at approximately the fifth thoracic vertebra. The right main bronchus subdivides into three secondary bronchi (also known as lobar bronchi), which deliver oxygen to the three lobes of the right lung—the superior, middle and inferior lobe. The azygos vein arches over it from behind; and the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it. About 2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the right lung, which is also called the eparterial bronchus. &quot;Eparterial&quot; refers to its position above the right pulmonary artery. The right bronchus now passes below the artery, and is known as the &quot;hyparterial&quot; branch which divides into the two lobar bronchi to the middle and lower lobes.

The left main bronchus is smaller in caliber but longer than the right, being 5 cm long. It enters the root of the left lung opposite the sixth thoracic vertebra. It passes beneath the aortic arch, crosses in front of the esophagus, the thoracic duct, and the descending aorta, and has the left pulmonary artery lying at first above, and then in front of it. The left bronchus has no eparterial branch, and therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the right lung. The left main bronchus divides into two secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung—the superior and the inferior lobe.

The secondary bronchi divide further into tertiary bronchi, (also known as segmental bronchi), each of which supplies a bronchopulmonary segment. A bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from the rest of the lung by a septum of connective tissue. This property allows a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments. Initially, there are ten segments in each lung, but during development with the left lung having just two lobes, two pairs of segments fuse to give eight, four for each lobe. The tertiary bronchi divide further in another three branchings known as 4th order, 5th order and 6th order segmental bronchi which are also referred to as subsegmental bronchi. These branch into many smaller bronchioles which divide into terminal bronchioles, each of which then gives rise to several respiratory bronchioles, which go on to divide into two to eleven alveolar ducts. There are five or six alveolar sacs associated with each alveolar duct. The alveolus is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange in the lung.

The main bronchi have relatively large lumens that are lined by respiratory epithelium. This cellular lining has cilia departing towards the mouth which removes dust and other small particles. There is a smooth muscle layer below the epithelium arranged as two ribbons of muscle that spiral in opposite directions. This smooth muscle layer contains seromucous glands, which secrete mucus, in its wall. Hyaline cartilage is present in the bronchi, surrounding the smooth muscle layer. In the main bronchi, the cartilage forms C-shaped rings like those in the trachea, while in the smaller bronchi, hyaline cartilage is present in irregularly arranged crescent-shaped plates and islands. These plates give structural support to the bronchi and keep the airway open.

The bronchial wall normally has a thickness of 10% to 20% of the total bronchial diameter.

===Microanatomy===
The cartilage and mucous membrane of the main bronchus (primary bronchi) are similar to those in the trachea. They are lined with respiratory epithelium, which is classified as ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The epithelium in the main bronchi contains goblet cells, which are glandular, modified simple columnar epithelial cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. Mucus plays an important role in keeping the airways clear in the mucociliary clearance process.

As branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases until it is absent in the bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a transition from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium, to simple squamous epithelium in the alveolar ducts and alveoli

===Variation===
In 0.1 to 5% of people there is a right superior lobe bronchus arising from the main stem bronchus prior to the carina. This is known as a tracheal bronchus, and seen as an anatomical variation. It can have multiple variations and, although usually asymptomatic, it can be the root cause of pulmonary disease such as a recurrent infection. In such cases resection is often curative.
The cardiac bronchus has a prevalence of ≈0.3% and presents as an accessory bronchus arising from the bronchus intermedius between the upper lobar bronchus and the origin of the middle and lower lobar bronchi of the right main bronchus.

An accessory cardiac bronchus is usually an asymptomatic condition but may be associated with persistent infection or hemoptysis. In about half of observed cases the cardiac bronchus presents as a short dead-ending bronchial stump, in the remainder the bronchus may exhibit branching and associated aerated lung parenchyma.

==Function==
The bronchi function to carry air that is breathed in through to the functional tissues of the lungs, called alveoli. Exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli. The alveolar ducts and alveoli consist primarily of simple squamous epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

==Clinical significance==

Bronchial wall thickening, as can be seen on CT scan, generally (but not always) implies inflammation of the bronchi (bronchitis). Normally, the ratio of the bronchial wall thickness and the bronchial diameter is between 0.17 and 0.23.

===Bronchitis===

Bronchitis is defined as inflammation of the bronchi, which can either be acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections. Many sufferers of chronic bronchitis also suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and this is usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure to irritants.

===Aspiration===
The left main bronchus departs from the trachea at a greater angle than that of the right main bronchus. The right bronchus is also wider than the left and these differences predispose the right lung to aspirational problems. If food, liquids, or foreign bodies are aspirated, they will tend to lodge in the right main bronchus. Bacterial pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia may result.

If a tracheal tube used for intubation is inserted too far, it will usually lodge in the right bronchus, allowing ventilation only of the right lung.

===Asthma===
Asthma is marked by hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi with an inflammatory component, often in response to allergens.

In asthma, the constriction of the bronchi can result in difficulty in breathing giving shortness of breath; this can lead to a lack of oxygen reaching the body for cellular processes. In this case, an inhaler can be used to rectify the problem. The inhaler administers a bronchodilator, which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi and to re-expand the airways. This effect occurs quite quickly.

===Bronchial atresia===
Bronchial atresia is a rare congenital disorder that can have a varied appearance. A bronchial atresia is a defect in the development of the bronchi, affecting one or more bronchi – usually segmental bronchi and sometimes lobar. The defect takes the form of a blind-ended bronchus. The surrounding tissue secretes mucus normally but builds up and becomes distended. This can lead to regional emphysema.

The collected mucus may form a mucoid impaction or a bronchocele, or both. A pectus excavatum may accompany a bronchial atresia.

<text>The bronchioles ( ) are the smaller branches of the bronchial airways in the lower respiratory tract. They include the terminal bronchioles, and finally the respiratory bronchioles that mark the start of the respiratory zone delivering air to the gas exchanging units of the alveoli. The bronchioles no longer contain the cartilage that is found in the bronchi, or glands in their submucosa.

== Structure ==

The pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1 mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. 
Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called &quot;terminal&quot;, which are 0.5 mm or less in diameter. Terminal bronchioles in turn divide into smaller respiratory bronchioles which divide into alveolar ducts. Terminal bronchioles mark the end of the conducting division of air flow in the respiratory system while respiratory bronchioles are the beginning of the respiratory division where gas exchange takes place.

The diameter of the bronchioles plays an important role in air flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called bronchodilation and is stimulated by either epinephrine or sympathetic nerves to increase air flow. A decrease in diameter is called bronchoconstriction, which is the tightening of the smooth muscle surrounding the bronchi and bronchioles due to and stimulated by histamine, parasympathetic nerves, cold air, chemical irritants, excess mucus production, viral infections, and other factors to decrease air flow. Bronchoconstriction can result in clinical symptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness, and dyspnea, which are common features of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic bronchitis. 

===Bronchioles===

The trachea divides into the left main bronchus which supplies the left lung, and the right main bronchus which supplies the right lung. As they enter the lungs these primary bronchi branch into secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi which supply each lobe of the lung. These in turn give rise to tertiary bronchi (&quot;tertiary&quot; meaning &quot;third&quot;), known as segmental bronchi which supply each bronchopulmonary segment. The segmentary bronchi subdivide into fourth order, fifth order and sixth order segmental bronchi before dividing into the bronchioles. The bronchioles are histologically distinct from the bronchi in that their walls do not have hyaline cartilage and they have club cells in their epithelial lining. The epithelium of the bronchioles starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support. The inner lining (lamina propria) of these bronchioles is thin with no glands present, and is surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle. As the bronchioles get smaller they divide into terminal bronchioles. Each bronchiole divides into between 50 and 80 terminal bronchioles. These bronchioles mark the end of the conducting zone, which covers the first division through the sixteenth division of the respiratory tract. Alveoli only become present when the conducting zone changes to the respiratory zone, from the sixteenth through the twenty-third division of the tract.

===Terminal bronchioles===
The terminal bronchioles are the most distal segment of the conducting zone. They branch off the lesser bronchioles. Each of the terminal bronchioles divides to form respiratory bronchioles which contain a small number of alveoli. Terminal bronchioles are lined with simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium containing club cells. Club cells are non-ciliated, rounded protein-secreting cells. Their secretions are a non-sticky, proteinaceous compound to maintain the airway in the smallest bronchioles. The secretion, called pulmonary surfactant, reduces surface tension, allowing for bronchioles to expand during inspiration and keeping the bronchioles from collapsing during expiration. Club cells are a stem cell of the respiratory system, and also produce enzymes that detoxify substances dissolved in the respiratory fluid.

===Respiratory bronchioles===
The respiratory bronchioles are the narrowest airways of the lungs, 0.5 mm across. The bronchi divide many times before evolving into the bronchioles.
The respiratory bronchioles deliver air to the exchange surfaces of the lungs.
They are interrupted by alveoli which are thin walled evaginations. Alveolar ducts are side branches of the respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles are lined by ciliated cuboidal epithelium along with some non-ciliated cells called club cells.

==Clinical significance==
Bronchospasm, a potentially life-threatening situation, occurs when the smooth muscular tissue of the bronchioles constricts, severely narrowing their diameter. The most common cause of this is asthma. Bronchospasm is commonly treated by oxygen therapy and bronchodilators such as albuterol.

Diseases of the bronchioles include asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans, respiratory syncytial virus infections, and influenza.

===Inflammation===
The medical condition of inflammation of the bronchioles is termed bronchiolitis.

<text>The Attica Prison riot took place at the state prison in Attica, New York; it started on September 9, 1971, and ended on September 13 with the highest number of fatalities in the history of United States prison uprisings. Of the 43 men who died (33 inmates and 10 correctional officers and employees), all but one guard and three inmates were killed by law enforcement gunfire when the state retook control of the prison on the final day of the uprising. The Attica Uprising has been described as a historic event in the prisoners&#x27; rights movement.

Prisoners revolted to seek better living conditions and political rights, claiming that they were treated as beasts. On September 9, 1971, 1,281 of the approximately 2,200 men incarcerated in the Attica Correctional Facility rioted and took control of the prison, taking 42 staff hostage. During the four days of negotiations, authorities agreed to 28 of the prisoners&#x27; demands, but did not accept the demand for the removal of Attica&#x27;s warden or to allow the inmates complete amnesty from criminal prosecution for the prison takeover. By order of Governor Nelson Rockefeller (after consultation with President Richard M. Nixon), armed corrections officers and state and local police were sent in to regain control of the prison. By the time they stopped firing, at least 39 people were dead: 10 correctional officers and civilian employees and 29 inmates, with nearly all killed by law enforcement gunfire. Law enforcement subjected many of the survivors to various forms of torture, including sexual violence.

Rockefeller had refused to go to the prison or meet with prisoners. After the uprising was suppressed, he falsely stated that the prisoners &quot;carried out the cold-blood killings they had threatened from the outset&quot;. Medical examiners confirmed that all but the deaths of one officer and three inmates were caused by law enforcement gunfire. The &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Fred Ferretti said the rebellion concluded in &quot;mass deaths that four days of taut negotiations had sought to avert.&quot;

As a result of the rebellion, the New York Corrections Department made changes in prisons to satisfy some of the prisoners&#x27; demands, reduce tension in the system, and prevent such incidents in the future. While there were improvements to prison conditions in the years immediately following the uprising, many of these improvements were reversed in the 1980s and 1990s. Attica remains one of the most infamous prison riots to have occurred in the United States.

== Background ==
The uprising occurred within the context of anti-colonial movements throughout the Third-World, the Black Power Movement and New Left movements within the United States, and intensifying state repression of these movements, including via War on Crime and the FBI&#x27;s Counter Intelligence Program. Some of the prisoners in Attica participated in the riot because they desired better living conditions. Historian and left-wing activist Howard Zinn wrote the following about the conditions in Attica prior to the uprising, 
Prisoners spent 14 to 16 hours a day in their cells, their mail was read, their reading material restricted, their visits from families conducted through a mesh screen, their medical care disgraceful, their parole system inequitable, racism everywhere. Overcrowding contributed to the poor conditions, as in recent years the prison&#x27;s population had increased from the 1,200 prisoners for which it was designed to 2,243.

Additionally, as in many American prisons, racial disparities also existed at Attica. Within the prison population, 54% of the incarcerated men were African American, 9% of them were Puerto Rican, and 37% of them were white. All of the guards or all but one of the guards (depending on the source) were white. Guards often threw out letters written in Spanish sent to or from Puerto Rican prisoners, and relegated black prisoners to the lowest-paid jobs and subjected them to regular racial harassment. There were also geographic disparities – most of the incarcerated men were from urban areas, including metropolitan New York, while most of the guards were from the local region.

Anthropologist Orisanmi Burton has shown that while improving prison conditions and racial disparities were an important concern, many Attica prisoners were critical of prison reform and participated in the uprising because they understood prisons like Attica as sites of revolutionary warfare. Burton therefore argues that the Attica rebellion was informed by the politics of prison abolition. For example, in 1972 an Attica prisoner named Joseph Little told a government panel, &quot;I&#x27;m not for no penitentiary reform. I&#x27;m for abolishing the whole concept of penitentiary reform.&quot;

During this period, there was a growing culture of activism in which prisoners not only demanded better treatment, but sought to participate in broader movements for radical social transformation within and beyond the United States. The previous year, multiple rebellions occurred throughout the New York City Jail system, including the Manhattan House of Detention, the Brooklyn House of Detention, The Queens Branch House of Detention at Kew Gardens, the Queens Branch House of Detention at Long Island City, and the Adolescent Remand Shelter on Rikers Island. Inmates at the Manhattan House of Detention held five guards hostage for eight hours, until state officials promised to hear prisoner grievances and they also promised not to take any punitive action against the rioters. Despite that promise, officials had the primary ringleaders shipped to various New York State Prisons and many were brutalized, held for months in solitary confinement and faced further criminal charges. Incarcerated people and state authorities in Auburn Correctional Facility engaged in an ongoing conflict and confrontation between November 2, 1970, and June 9, 1971. Several participants in what came to be known as the Auburn prison riot were subsequently transferred to other New York State prisons, including Attica.

In July 1971, a group of Attica inmates presented a list of 27 demands regarding improvements in living conditions in Attica to state Commissioner of Corrections Russell Oswald and Governor Nelson Rockefeller. These demands included improvements in multiple areas such as diet, the quality of guards, rehabilitation programs, and, in particular, education programs. The inmates also demanded increased religious freedom, the ability to engage in political activity, and an end to censorship, which they argued were all vital to a proper education within the prison. The commissioner did not take any actions on the list of demands. Attica warden Vincent Mancusi responded by adding additional restrictions to inmates&#x27; reading materials and personal belongings.

In August 1971, George Jackson, an author and prominent member of the Black Panther Party, was shot and killed during an escape attempt in which three prison guards and two white inmates were murdered at San Quentin State Prison in California. Through his writings, Jackson had encouraged imprisoned people throughout the United States to become politically active. As a result, Jackson became one of the first targets of the FBI&#x27;s Black Extremist Activities in Penal institutions program, which later evolved into the Prison Activists Surveillance Program (PRISACTS). Many incarcerated people in Attica had read Jackson&#x27;s books and cited Jackson&#x27;s death as a major catalyst for the riot. The day after Jackson&#x27;s death, at least 700 Attica inmates participated in a hunger strike in his honor.

==The initial uprising==
On Wednesday, September 8, 1971, two inmates fought during their recreation break, and a correctional officer came up to intervene. One inmate had already left the area, but the officer demanded the remaining inmate return to his cell, and in the ensuing argument the inmate hit the officer. Other inmates and guards joined the commotion, and another inmate also hit the same officer, Lt. Richard Maroney, but before the violence could intensify, Lieutenant Robert Curtiss moved to deescalate the situation. Later that evening, warden Vincent Mancusi ordered the two inmates, Leroy Dewer and Ray Lamorie, involved in the altercation to be taken to solitary confinement, but when the officers arrived at 5 Company to take the inmates away, other prisoners resisted. The other inmates in 5 Company shouted and threw things at the guards and one inmate, William Ortiz, hit an officer, Tom Boyle, with a can of soup, resulting in him being assigned to &quot;keep lock&quot;, or confinement to his cell.

The morning of Thursday, September 9, 1971, prisoners of 5 Company were still upset and demanded that officers tell them what would become of Ortiz. Officer Gordon Kelsey told them he did not know and tried to continue the routine. As inmates headed to breakfast, some managed to open Ortiz&#x27;s cell door and he left with them to the mess hall. When the command staff found out what had occurred, they decided to return all of the men of 5 Company to their cells after breakfast. But they did not inform all the correctional officers, and when officers led inmates out toward the recreation area after breakfast, both officers and inmates were surprised to find the doors locked. The inmates believed they were about to be punished and a melee broke out, which resulted in chaos as some inmates attacked the guards and others tried to flee. The chaos spread to other nearby companies of inmates, and the uprising began. During this stage, several guards and inmates were injured. Officer William Quinn would die in the hospital two days later of injuries sustained during the initial riot.

By noon on September 9, correctional officers and police controlled about half the prison and its inmates, while 1,281 of Attica&#x27;s approximately 2,200 inmates controlled the other half, including D-yard, two tunnels, and the central control room, referred to as &quot;Times Square&quot;. Inmates held 42 officers and civilian employees as hostages.

==Negotiations==
Once inmates had secured their section of the prison, they began organizing. Inmates elected leaders to represent them in negotiations, appointed inmates to serve as medics and security, and began drafting a list of demands for officials to meet before they would surrender. For example, Frank &quot;Big Black&quot; Smith (September 11, 1933 – July 31, 2004) was appointed as head of security, and he kept both the hostages and the observers committee safe. Additionally, 21-year-old Elliott James &quot;L.D.&quot; Barkley, an ardent orator, was a strong force during the negotiations. He spoke eloquently to the inmates, journalist camera crews, and viewers at home. Barkley, just days away from his scheduled release at the time of the uprising, was killed during the recapturing of the prison.

As speakers such as Barkley raised morale, the elected group of negotiators drafted proposals to present to the commissioner. &quot;The Attica Liberation Faction Manifesto of Demands&quot; was a compilation of complaints written by the Attica prisoners, which speak directly to the &quot;sincere people of society&quot;. It included 33 demands, including better medical treatment, fair visitation rights, improved food quality, religious freedom, higher wages for inmate jobs, &quot;an end of physical abuse, for [access to] basic necessities like toothbrushes and showers every day, for professional training, and access to newspapers and books.&quot; The manifesto assigns the power to negotiate to five inmates elected to represent the others: Donald Noble, Peter Butler, Frank Lott, Carl Jones-El, and Herbert Blyden X. Additionally, the document specifically lists &quot;vile and vicious slave masters&quot; who oppressed the prisoners, such as the New York governor, New York corrections, and the United States courts.

Inmates requested a team of outside observers to assist with negotiations, whom they considered knowledgeable of prison conditions, many of whom officials were able to persuade to come to Attica. Observers included Tom Wicker, an editor of the &quot;New York Times&quot;; James Ingram of the &quot;Michigan Chronicle&quot;; State Senator John Dunne, head of a Prisons Committee in the legislature; State Representative Arthur Eve, U.S. congressman from New York; attorney Herman Badillo; civil rights lawyer William Kunstler; Clarence Jones, publisher of the &quot;Amsterdam News&quot; in New York and former advisor to Martin Luther King Jr.; representatives of the Young Lords, and others. Prisoners requested Minister Louis Farrakhan, national representative of the Nation of Islam, but he declined. Inmates also requested representatives from the Black Panther Party; Bobby Seale addressed the inmates briefly on September 11 but did not stay long and some believed that he inflamed tensions.

The prisoners and team of observers continued to negotiate with Commissioner of Corrections Russell Oswald, who agreed to 28 of the inmates&#x27; demands, but refused to agree to amnesty for the inmates involved in the uprising or to fire the Attica warden. William Kunstler, a lawyer who agreed to represent the inmates in negotiations, said, &quot;The prisoners had two non-negotiable demands: the removal of the warden, and general amnesty, and they had already given up on the removal of the warden. And on the general amnesty, we had worked out several formulas that we were discussing with the commissioner hours before the attack, and if we had been allowed to continue, everyone would be alive and the matter would be settled today.&quot;

The situation may have been further complicated by Governor Rockefeller&#x27;s refusal even to come to the prison or meet with the inmates. Instead, Rockefeller dispatched Commissioner of the Office of General Services Almerin C. O&#x27;Hara, a retired National Guard major general, as his personal representative and liaison. Because Rockefeller was unwilling to compromise, some analysts&#x27; later evaluations of the incident postulated that Rockefeller&#x27;s absence prevented the situation from deteriorating. Negotiations broke down, as Oswald was unwilling or unable to make further concessions to the inmates. Oswald and members of the observers committee called Rockefeller and begged him to come to the prison to calm the situation, but he refused. Following the governor&#x27;s refusal, Oswald and Rockefeller agreed that Oswald would order the State Police to retake the facility by force, a decision which was later criticized.

==Retaking of the prison and retaliation==
On the night of Sunday, September 12, 1971, plans were drawn up to retake the prison by force. Members of the team of observers argued for Oswald to deliver to inmates one final appeal for a settlement before the forcible retaking. Oswald agreed, but was instructed not to phrase the demand as an ultimatum, as Rockefeller did not want to let inmates know that the assault was beginning. At 8:25 a.m. on Monday, September 13, 1971, Oswald gave the inmates a statement directing them to release the hostages and accept the offered settlement within the hour. However, he did not tell them that negotiations had ended and he would take the prison back by force if they refused, even stating, &quot;I want to continue negotiations with you.&quot; The inmates rejected his offer, and as it appeared to them as though Rockefeller remained opposed to their demands the mood among the inmates deteriorated.

In preparation for prison authorities potentially taking the prison back by force, inmates had dug defensive trenches, electrified metal gates, fashioned crude battlements out of metal tables and dirt, and fortified the &quot;Times Square&quot; prison command center. After Oswald left following the inmates&#x27; rejection of his latest offer, the inmates decided to try to impress upon prison officials that they were serious about their demands, and to remind them that inmates had power over the hostages if the state was to come in by force. The inmates brought eight corrections officers to the catwalk on top of the command center and surrounded them with inmates armed with homemade weapons. According to surviving inmates, they did not intend to kill the hostages, but rather to use them as insurance. Shortly after inmates and hostages were positioned on the catwalk, Oswald gave the order to begin the retaking. Of the decision, he later said, &quot;On a much smaller scale, I think I have some feeling now of how Truman must have felt when he decided to drop the A-bomb.&quot;

At 9:46 a.m. on Monday, September 13, 1971, tear gas was dropped into the yard and hundreds of New York State Police troopers, Bureau of Criminal Investigation personnel, deputy sheriffs, park police, and correctional officers opened fire into the smoke. Among the weapons used by the troopers were shotguns loaded with buckshot pellets, which led to the wounding and killing of hostages and inmates who were not resisting. Additionally, some of the guns utilized by law enforcement used unjacketed bullets, &quot;a kind of ammunition that causes such enormous damage to human flesh that it was banned by the Geneva Conventions.&quot; Correctional officers from Attica were allowed to participate, a decision later called &quot;inexcusable&quot; by the commission established by Rockefeller to study the riot and the aftermath. By the time the facility was reported as fully secured at 10:05 a.m., law enforcement had shot at least 128 men and killed nine hostages and twenty-nine inmates. A tenth hostage, Correctional Officer Harrison W. Whalen, died on October 9, 1971, of gunshot wounds received during the assault.

Inmate survivors alleged that leaders were singled out and killed by troopers during and after the retaking. According to a doctor who treated survivors, &quot;[m]any of the ringleaders were approached by guards and shot systematically. Some had their hands in the air surrendering. Some were lying on the ground.&quot; One of the leaders, Elliott James &quot;L.D.&quot; Barkley, who was frequently featured in news coverage, was allegedly alive after the initial retaking. Assemblyman Arthur Eve testified that Barkley was alive after the prisoners had surrendered and the state regained control; another inmate stated that the officers searched Barkley out, yelling his name, and executed him with a shot to the back. Sam Melville, a member of the committee that helped organize and draft inmates&#x27; demands and who was known in the prison as a radical, was allegedly shot while he had his hands in the air trying to surrender.

The final death toll from the rebellion also includes the officer fatally injured by inmates during the initial uprising and three inmates who were subjected to vigilante killings by fellow inmates before the retaking of the prison. Ten hostages died from gunfire by state troopers and soldiers. The New York State Special Commission on Attica wrote, &quot;With the exception of Indian massacres in the late 19th century, the State Police assault which ended the four-day prison uprising was the bloodiest one-day encounter between Americans since the Civil War.&quot;

State officials, including Oswald and Rockefeller, initially stated that inmates slit the throats of many of their hostages. The false information was widely reported in the media. But less than 24 hours later, official medical examiners confirmed that all the hostages had been killed by bullets fired by law enforcement officers. The Special Commission found that state officials failed to quickly refute the early rumors and false reports.

Troopers and prison officers set about with physically violent and humiliating reprisals. Inmates were made to strip naked and crawl through mud, broken glass, and the prisoners&#x27; hand-dug latrines. State officials also subjected the prisoners to sexual violence and rape. Directed into the prison, they were forced to run hallways naked between lines of enraged officers, who beat the inmates and yelled insults and racial slurs. Some inmates, including leaders such as Frank Smith, were subject to additional reprisals and punishments, including repeated physical abuse and being locked in solitary confinement. Several days after the uprising&#x27;s end, doctors treating wounded inmates reported evidence of more beatings. As the repression was happening in Attica, incarcerated people in other New York State Prisons, especially Auburn Correctional Facility and Clinton Correctional Facility, were subjected to similar forms of violence. Many of these men had previously been incarcerated in Attica and had been involved in political organizations.

==Public response==

Following the uprising, protests and riots occurred in prisons across the United States, including in prisons in New York, Massachusetts, Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia, and Georgia. According to a Prisoners Solidarity Committee newsletter from September 30, 1971, &quot;[t]he 13 reported rebellions since the Attica massacre doubles the total number of reported prison rebellions since the beginning of this year&quot;. Numerous rallies in support of the prisoners occurred, especially in New York, but also in cities as far away as Los Angeles and Norman, Oklahoma; several rallies in support of Governor Rockefeller also took place. In addition, activists such as Angela Davis and artists such as John Lennon wrote works in support of the inmates and condemning the official response.

At 7:30 p.m. on September 17, militant left-wing organization the Weather Underground launched a retaliatory attack on the New York Department of Corrections, exploding a bomb near Oswald&#x27;s office. &quot;The communiqué accompanying the attack called the prison system an example of &#x27;how a society run by white racists maintains its control,&#x27; with white supremacy being the &#x27;main question white people have to face.

In response to public criticism, in November 1971 Governor Rockefeller established the New York State Special Commission on Attica, appointing members and naming Dean of NYU Law School Robert B. McKay as chair. Known as the McKay Commission, the commission was directed to investigate the circumstances leading up to, during, and following the events at Attica. The commission&#x27;s report, published in September 1972, was critical of Rockefeller, the Department of Corrections, and New York State Police for their handling of the prison retaking and for their negligence in protecting inmates from reprisals after the riot.

==Lawsuits and payments==
In October 1971, Robert Fischer was appointed as Special Deputy Attorney General to lead the Attica Task Force and was charged with investigating any criminal acts that may have been committed during the uprising or retaking (Fischer was later succeeded as the Attica Task Force leader by Anthony Simonetti). Within four years of the uprising, 62 inmates had been charged in 42 indictments with 1,289 separate counts. One state trooper was indicted for reckless endangerment. In May 1975, two former inmates were convicted in the death of William Quinn, despite the fact that &quot;[o]nly faltering evidence linked the two inmates to the actual beating that left Quinn dead&quot;. Charles Pernasilice, who was Catawba Indian, was sentenced to a term of up to two years for attempted assault, and John Hill, who was Mohawk, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years to life. Supporters alleged that the trial was unfairly conducted and that the men&#x27;s ethnicity contributed to their indictment and conviction, with Hill&#x27;s lawyer William Kunstler saying at the sentencing, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to give the impression to the outside world that there is justice here.&quot;

In 1975, Malcolm Bell, a prosecutor in the Attica Task Force, sent a report to Governor Hugh Carey alleging that his superiors were covering up evidence of criminal actions by law enforcement officers in the retaking of Attica and preventing him from fully investigating and prosecuting law enforcement. After Bell&#x27;s report was leaked to the public, Carey appointed Judge Bernard S. Meyer of the Supreme Court for Nassau County, New York to the post of Special Deputy Attorney General to investigate. The Meyer Report, released in December 1975, found &quot;[t]here was no intentional cover-up&quot;, but &quot;there were, however, serious errors of judgment&quot; including &quot;important omissions on the part of the State Police in the gathering of evidence.&quot;

Initially, only the first of the three-volume Meyer report was released to the public; in 1981 the State Supreme Court ordered that the other two be sealed permanently. The Forgotten Victims of Attica, a group made up of officers injured in the riot and families of killed officers, pushed for the State of New York to release state records of the uprising to the public. In 2013, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he would seek release of the entirety of volumes 2 and 3, totaling 350 pages. After redactions, 46 pages of the report were released in May 2015. The released pages contain accounts from witnesses and inmates describing torture, burning, and sexual abuse of inmates by prison authorities. In 2021, the 50th anniversary of the uprising, the Forgotten Victims of Attica, surviving inmates, families of killed inmates, historians, and lawyers continued to push for the release of all records related to Attica.

In December 1976, Governor Carey announced he was &quot;closing the book on Attica&quot;. He pardoned all inmates who had previously pleaded guilty to obtain reduced sentences, commuted the sentences of the two inmates convicted in court, and dismissed pending disciplinary actions against 20 law enforcement officers relating to the uprising.

Though the possibility of criminal suits was closed with Carey&#x27;s decision, civil suits were allowed to proceed. Surviving inmates and families of inmates killed in the prison retaking sued the State of New York for civil rights violations by law enforcement officers and prison officials during and after the retaking of Attica. After decades in the courts, the state agreed in 2000 to pay $8 million ($12 million minus legal fees) to settle the case.

In 2005, the state separately settled with surviving prison employees and families of the slain prison employees for $12 million. Frank &quot;Big Black&quot; Smith advocated both for compensation for inmate survivors and the families of the deceased, and for their correctional officer counterparts who had been killed or injured and their bereaved as well.

==Effects on the New York State prison system==
Partially in response to the Attica uprising, the New York State Department of Corrections implemented changes including:

# Providing more basics such as more showers, soap, medical care, and family visits
#Introducing a grievance procedure in which inmates could report actions by a staff member that violated published policy
#Creating liaison committees in which inmates elect representatives to speak for them in meetings with prison officials
#Allocating funding to Prisoners Legal Services, a statewide network of lawyers to assist inmates
#Providing access to higher education
#Allowing more religious freedom for inmates
While there were improvements in prison conditions in the years immediately following the uprising, during the &quot;tough on crime&quot; era of the 1980s and 1990s many of these improvements were reversed. For example, the 1994 Crime Bill eliminated all Pell Grants for prisoners, resulting in the defunding of higher education within prisons. As a result, all university-level education programs in prisons ended with no other educational options for inmates. Overcrowding worsened, with the prison population of New York increasing dramatically from 12,500 at the time of the Attica uprising to 72,600 in 1999. In 2011, after a man incarcerated in Attica was brutally beaten by guards, for the first time in New York State history, correction officers were criminally charged for a non-sexual assault of an inmate. The guards pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of misconduct in order to avoid prison time. In news stories regarding the incident, current and former inmates of Attica reported that the prison maintained a reputation as &quot;a facility where a small group of correction officers dole out harsh punishment largely with impunity&quot; and inmates conveyed numerous stories of poor conditions and severe treatment by guards.

Interpreting the post-Attica reforms through the lens of counterinsurgency theory and practice, anthropologist Orisanmi Burton has argued that these temporary &quot;improvements&quot; to prison conditions were designed to fracture that organizing and activism taking place within prisons and to create a cleavage between the prison population&#x27;s reformist and revolutionary/abolitionist elements.

== Books ==
Published in 1972, the first historical account of the Attica Prison Uprising was written by The New York State Special Commission on Attica and was entitled &quot;Attica: The Official Report&quot;.

Published in 1974, The Brothers of Attica is a first hand account written by a former Attica prisoner and Nation of Islam member named Richard X. Clark.

&quot;In 1975,&quot; Tom Wicker, a &quot;New York Times&quot; editor, who was present at the prison as an observer, published &quot;A Time to Die&quot;.

Another Attica observer, Clarence Jones, released (with Stuart Connelly) his historical account &quot;Uprising: Understanding Attica, Revolution and the Incarceration State&quot; in 2011.

In 1985, Malcolm Bell, a former prosecutor for the Attica Task Force and eventual whistleblower, released his account of the investigation and alleged coverup &quot;The Turkey Shoot: Tracking the Attica Cover-up&quot;.

A detailed historical account of the uprising was published by historian Heather Ann Thompson in 2016. The book, entitled &quot;Blood in the Water&quot;, draws on interviews with former inmates, hostages, families of victims, law enforcement, lawyers, and state officials, as well as significant archives of previously unreleased materials.

Published in 2021, &quot;The Prison Guard&#x27;s Daughter: My Journey Through the Ashes of Attica&quot; is a memoir by Deanne Quinn Miller (with Gary Craig), the daughter of the prison guard killed during the initial riot, William Quinn, and an organizer with The Forgotten Victims of Attica, a group made up of surviving hostages and families of prison employees who were killed.

In 2022, Joshua Melville, the son of Sam Melville, one of the inmates killed in the retaking of the prison, released &quot;American Time Bomb: Attica, Sam Melville, and a Son&#x27;s Search for Answers&quot;. The memoir tells the story of the life of Sam Melville, the Attica Uprising, and the broader goals and controversies of the New Left movement.

In 2020, a non-fiction graphic novel entitled &quot;Big Black: Stand at Attica&quot; was published. It was co-written by Frank &quot;Big Black&quot; Smith, an inmate leader during the uprising. The book was included on the 2020 list of Top Ten Best Graphic Novels for Adults compiled by the Graphic Novels and Comics Round Table of the American Library Association.

In October 2023, &quot;Tip of the Spear: Black Radicalism, Prison Repression, and the Long Attica Revolt&quot; was published by the University of California Press. Drawing on previously untapped archival sources and oral history, anthropologist Orisanmi Burton focuses on the revolutionary, internationalist, and abolitionist dimensions of the Attica rebellion, which the author argues had been largely ignored by previous historical accounts. The book is especially critical of historian Heather Ann Thompson&#x27;s account, arguing that because of its uncritical over-reliance on state-records and its failure to engage non-traditional sources produced and archived by the prisoners themselves, &quot;Blood in the Water&quot; produces a distorted image of Attica through the eyes of the state. Tip of the Spear also challenges the official chronology and geography of the Attica rebellion, arguing that the eruption that occurred in Attica on September 9, 1971, was the culmination of series of rebellions that had been erupting in various New York City jails and state prisons for a year prior to Attica. For this reason, Burton reframes the Attica riot as &quot;The Long Attica Revolt.&quot; The book also shows that in response to the rebellion, prison management techniques began to incorporate elements of counterinsurgency theory and practice, as well as psychological warfare and behavior modification, and mind control experimentation. Tip of the Spear has received critical acclaim from outlets such as The Progressive, The Los Angeles Review of Books, Public Books, Verso, &quot;Medical Anthropology Quarterly&quot;, and &quot;Current Anthropology.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Direct coverage of the Attica Prison rebellion:

* On September 9, 2021, the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the uprising, the documentary &quot;Attica&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. In order for director Stanley Nelson &quot;To tell the story of Attica, he conducts dozens of new interviews with prisoners, journalists, and other eyewitnesses. He makes powerful use of surveillance footage and the extensive news coverage that made Attica a national event.&quot; Produced by Firelight Films and Showtime Documentary Films, the film was released on Showtime in fall 2021.
* In preparation for the 50th anniversary of the Attica prison massacre in 2021, HBO Max released a documentary titled &quot;Betrayal at Attica&quot; on August 1, 2021. The plot is described as: &quot;On September 13, 1971, the State of New York shot and killed 39 of its citizens, injured hundreds more, and tortured the survivors. The plan to retake D Yard led to one of the bloodiest days in American history and set the stage for the worst aspects of modern policing. Radical lawyer Elizabeth Fink tells the story of the Attica prison rebellion, and how she exposed the cover-up that went on for decades.&quot;
*In 2019 Icarus Films released &quot;Ghosts of Attica&quot;, a documentary directed by Brad Lichtenstein featuring extensive interviews with survivors of the uprising, including Frank &quot;Big Black&quot; Smith, who served as the inmate head of security during the uprising; Mike Smith, one of the hostages who was shot during the retaking; Elizabeth Fink, a lawyer who headed the lawsuits for the inmates; and several members of the observer&#x27;s committee, including Tom Wicker, Congressman Herman Badillo, Assemblyman Arthur Eve, and William Kunstler.
* As part of a 40th-anniversary commemoration, filmmakers Chris Christopher and David Marshall, in association with Blue Sky Project, produced a 60-minute, Emmy-nominated documentary called &quot;Criminal Injustice: Death and Politics at Attica&quot;, first aired on PBS in 2012, which brings together a range of previously unavailable interviewees who deconstruct and expose many myths and misconceptions about the Attica Prison rebellion, its causes, and its coverup.
*ScreenSlate describes Cinda Firestone&#x27;s documentary, titled &quot;Attica&quot; (1974), as follows: &quot;Firestone&#x27;s 1974 film, restored in 2007, culls together primary footage from surveillance and news cameras along with prisoner, family, and guard interviews to create an account of the massacre that has been described as temperate, but undeniably damning concerning the state&#x27;s actions.
*At least three fictionalized TV movies of the rebellion have been produced: &quot;Attica&quot; (1980) directed by Marvin J. Chomsky, with George Grizzard and Morgan Freeman; John Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Against the Wall&quot; (1994), with Samuel L. Jackson, Kyle MacLachlan, and Clarence Williams III; and &quot;The Killing Yard&quot; (2001), directed by Euzhan Palcy, with Alan Alda and Morris Chestnut.

Notable references to the Attica Prison rebellion:

*The riot was famously referenced in a quote in the 1975 Sidney Lumet-directed film, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, when Al Pacino&#x27;s character shouts, &quot;Attica! Attica!,&quot; to the reporters and policemen gathered outside during his hostage crisis. The line was placed at number eighty-six on &quot;100 Years...100 Movie Quotes&quot;. Two years later in 1977, John Travolta&#x27;s character of Tony Manero would quote Pacino&#x27;s Attica chant in the movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.

===Music===
The incident is directly referenced in several songs and the name of a band:
* The album &quot;Attica Blues&quot; (1972) by Archie Shepp, and especially its title song, is dedicated to the riots.
* The song &quot;Rubber Bullets&quot; (1973) by British band 10cc.
* The song &quot;Attica State&quot; (1972) by British singer John Lennon.
* The song &quot;Attica Part 1&quot; (1972) By Caribbean Folk singer Exuma.
* The song &quot;The Hostage&quot; (1972) by American folk musician Tom Paxton.
* The song &quot;Remember Rockefeller at Attica&quot; (1975) by jazz musician Charles Mingus, included in his album &quot;Changes One&quot;.
* The song &quot;Hardcore Rap Act&quot; (1995) by Brooklyn-based hip hop duo Das EFX.
* The song &quot;If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)&quot; (1996) by rapper Nas.

===Poetry===
* Boxer Muhammad Ali recited a poem during an interview on RTÉ on a visit to Ireland in July 1972, imagining what Attica&#x27;s prisoners would have said before their death.
* In 1972, avant-garde composer and pianist Frederic Rzewski wrote two pieces connected to the Attica uprising, both for percussion ensemble and speaker. &quot;Coming Together&quot; sets a text by Sam Melville, a leader of the uprising and one of the people who lost their lives as a result of it, from a letter he wrote in 1971. The second and shorter piece, &quot;Attica&quot;, is set to the statement made by inmate Richard X. Clark when he was released from the prison: &quot;Attica is in front of me now.&quot; The two pieces were recorded in 1973 for the Opus One label by the Blackearth Percussion Group, with Steven ben Israel of the Living Theater as the speaker.

===Television===

* In the season 1 finale of &quot;Oz&quot; &quot;A Game of Checkers&quot;, Tim McManus reveals to Said that he grew up in Attica and was a child when the riots occurred days before his birthday, with McManus hoping to prevent the deaths of the inmates and correctional officers during the Emerald City riot.
* In the final episode of &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; season 4, the prisoners rise and chant &quot;Attica! Attica!&quot;. The entirety of season 5 is devoted to the rebellion itself, which contains significant parallels to the Attica uprising.
* The Attica Prison uprising served as a source of inspiration for the Bell Riots in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Past Tense&quot;.

<text>Ziaur Rahman (19 January 193630 May 1981) was a Bangladeshi military officer and politician who served as the sixth President of Bangladesh from 1977 until his assassination in 1981. One of the leading figures of country&#x27;s independence war, he broadcast the Bangladeshi declaration of independence in March 1971 from Chittagong. He was the founder of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). He previously served as the third chief of army staff from 1975 to 1978 with a minor break.

Ziaur, sometimes known as Zia, was born in Gabtali and trained at the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad. He served as a commander in the Pakistan Army in the Second Kashmir War against the Indian Army for which he was awarded the Hilal-e-Jurrat from the Pakistani government. Ziaur was a prominent Bangladesh Forces commander during the country&#x27;s war in 1971. He broadcast the declaration of independence on 27 March from Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra radio station in Kalurghat, Chittagong. During the war in 1971, Ziaur was a Bangladesh Forces Commander of BDF Sector 1 initially, and from June as BDF Commander of BDF Sector 11 of the Bangladesh Forces and the Brigade Commander of Z Force from mid-July. After the war, Ziaur became a brigade commander in Bangladesh Army and later the deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff of Bangladesh Army. His ascent to leadership of the country resulted from the political crisis that had begun with the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding president of Bangladesh in 15 August 1975 military coup, followed by 3 November coup and then finally the 7 November coup (the Sipahi–Janata Revolution) within the military to gain control at the helm. Ziaur Rahman gained the &quot;de facto&quot; power as head of the government under martial law imposed by the Justice Sayem government. He took over the presidency in 1977.

As president in 1978, Ziaur Rahman founded Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He reinstated multi-party politics, freedom of the press, free speech and free markets and accountability. He initiated mass irrigation and food production programmes, including social programmes to uplift the lives of the people. His government initiated efforts to create a regional group in South Asia, which later became SAARC in 1985. He improved Bangladesh&#x27;s relations with the West and China, and departed from Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s close alignment with India. Domestically, Ziaur faced as many as twenty-one coup attempts for which military tribunals were set up, resulting in at least 200 soldiers of Army and Air Force officers being executed, earning him a reputation of being &quot;strict&quot; and &quot;ruthless&quot; amongst international observers. Throughout his military career, Ziaur Rahman was awarded two gallantry awards for two campaigns he participated in; he was awarded the Hilal-i-Jurat for the Indo-Pak War in 1965, and Bir Uttom in 1972 for the Bangladesh Liberation War. He retired from the Bangladesh Army with the rank of Lt. General in 1978.

Ziaur Rahman&#x27;s death created a divided opinion on his legacy in Bangladeshi politics. Awami League supporters vilify him for alleged connections to Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s assassination and controversial actions during his presidency. Critics argue that the Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s authoritarian regime politically motivated the negative portrayal of Ziaur&#x27;s legacy. Nevertheless, Zia is generally credited for his role in the Liberation War, stabilizing Bangladesh, industrializing agriculture, and fostering regional cooperation. His political party, the BNP, remains a major force alongside its rival, the Awami League, with his widow, Khaleda Zia, leading the party and serving three terms as prime minister.

==Early life==
Ziaur Rahman was born on 19 January 1936 to a Bengali Muslim family of Mandals in the village of Bagbari in Gabtali, Bogra District. His father, Mansur Rahman, was a chemist who specialised in paper and ink chemistry and worked for a government department at Writers&#x27; Building in Kolkata. His grandfather, Moulvi Kamaluddin Mandal, migrated from Mahishaban to Nashipur-Bagbari after marrying his grandmother Meherunnisa. His mother&#x27;s name was Jahanara Khatun. Ziaur Rahman was raised in his home village of Bagbari and studied in Bogra Zilla School. He had two younger brothers, Ahmed Kamal (d. 2017) and Khalilur Rahman (d. 2014).

In 1946, Mansur Rahman enrolled Ziaur Rahman for a short stint in a boys school of Calcutta, Hare School, where he studied until the dissolution of the British Empire in India and partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. Mansur Rahman exercised his option to become a citizen of a Muslim majority Pakistan and in August 1947 moved to Karachi, the first capital of Pakistan located in Sindh, West Pakistan. Zia, at the age of 11, had become a student in class six at the Academy School in Karachi in 1947. Ziaur Rahman spent his adolescent years in Karachi and by age 16, completed his secondary education from that school in 1952.

In 1953, Ziaur Rahman was admitted into the D. J. Sindh Government Science College. The same year, he joined the Pakistan Military Academy at Kakul as a cadet.

In August 1960, his marriage was arranged to Khaleda Khanam Putul, the 15-year-old daughter of Iskandar and Taiyaba Majumder from the Feni District (part of then Noakhali District). Khaleda Khanam Putul, later known as Khaleda Zia, went on serve as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh three times. At the time, Ziaur Rahman was a captain in the Pakistan Army, who was posted as an Officer of the Defence Forces. His father, Mansur Rahman could not attend the marriage ceremony, as he was in Karachi. Zia&#x27;s mother had died earlier.

==Military service in Pakistan==
Graduating from the Pakistan Military Academy at 12th PMA long course on 18 September 1955 in the top 10% of his class, Ziaur Rahman was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Pakistan Army. In the army, he received commando training, became a paratrooper and received training in a special intelligence course.

Ziaur Rahman went to East Pakistan on a short visit and was struck by the negative attitude of the Bengali middle class towards the military, which consumed a large chunk of the country&#x27;s resources. The low representation of the Bengalis in the military was largely due to discrimination, but Ziaur Rahman felt that the Bengali attitude towards the military perhaps prevented promising young Bengali from seeking military careers. As a Bengali army officer, he advocated military careers for Bengali youth.
After serving for two years in Karachi, he was transferred to the East Bengal Regiment in 1957. He attended military training schools of British Army. He also worked in the military intelligence department from 1959 to 1964.

Ayub Khan&#x27;s military rule from 1958 to 1968 convinced Ziaur Rahman of the need for a fundamental change in the Bengali attitude towards the military. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Ziaur Rahman saw combat in the Khemkaran sector in Punjab as the commander of a company (military unit) of 100–150 soldiers. Ziaur Rahman was awarded Hilal-i-Jur&#x27;at (Crescent of Courage) medal for gallantry by the Pakistan government, Pakistan&#x27;s second highest military award, and the first Battalion of the East Bengal Regiment (EBR) under which he fought won 3 Sitara-e-Jurat (Star of Courage) medals, and 8 Tamgha-i-Jurat (Medal of Courage) medals, for their role in the 1965 War with India. In 1966, Ziaur Rahman was appointed military instructor at the Pakistan Military Academy, later going on to attend the Command and Staff College in Quetta, Pakistan, he completed a course in command and tactical warfare. Ziaur Rahman helped raise two Bengali battalions called the 8th and 9th Bengals during his stint as instructor. Around the same time, his wife Khaleda Zia, now 24, gave birth to their first child Tarique Rahman on 20 November 1966. Ziaur Rahman joined the 2nd East Bengal regiment as its second-in-command at Joydebpur in Gazipur district, near Dhaka, in 1969, and travelled to West Germany to receive advanced military and command training from the British Army of the Rhine and later spent a few months with the British Army.

=== Pre-Independence ===
Ziaur Rahman returned to Pakistan the following year. He was posted in Chittagong, East Pakistan in October 1970 to be second-in-command of the 8th East Bengal Regiment. East Pakistan had been devastated by the 1970 Bhola cyclone, and the population had been embittered by the slow response of the central government and the political conflict between Pakistan&#x27;s two major parties, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&#x27;s Awami League, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP). In the 1970 Pakistani general election, the Awami League had won a majority and its leader Sheikh Mujib laid claim to form a government, but Pakistan president Yahya Khan postponed the convening of the legislature under pressure from Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s PPP party.

==Bangladesh Liberation War==
Following the failure of last-ditch talks, Yahya Khan declared martial law and ordered the army to crack down on Bengali political activities. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested before midnight on 26 March 1971, taken to Tejgaon International Airport and flown to West Pakistan. He was a Bangladesh Forces Commander of BDF Sector 1 initially, and from June as BDF commander of BDF Sector 11 of the Bangladesh Forces and the Brigade Commander of Z Force from mid-July.

Zia, who already by then geared to revolt against the government of Pakistan revolted and later arrested and executed his commanding officer Lt. Col. Janjua. He was requested by the local Awami League supporters and leaders, to announce the Declaration of Independence that was earlier (in early hours of 26 March 1971) proclaimed by the undisputed Bengali leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, before his (Ziaur Rahman) arrest on 27 March 1971 from Kalurghat, Chittagong, as an Army officer&#x27;s words would carry weight restoring people&#x27;s trust in the &#x27;Declaration of Independence&#x27;, which read:

&quot;I, Major Ziaur Rahman, Provincial Head of the government, do hereby declare the Independence of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh.&quot;
But his (Ziaur Rahman) proclamation as the &quot;Provincial Head&quot; of the government, was much criticised and rebuked by the political leaders present there and he realised his mistake.

Later on the same day (27 March), a second broadcast was read as correction:

&quot;I, Major Ziaur Rahman, do hereby declare the Independence of Bangladesh on behalf of our great leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.&quot;

Later in an interview with German Radio, Ziaur Rahman talked about his 27 March announcement.

Ziaur Rahman organised an infantry unit gathering all Bengali soldiers from military and EPR units in Chittagong. He designated it Sector No. 1 with its HQ in Sabroom. A few weeks later, he was transferred to Teldhala where he organised and created Sector 11. All sectors were restructured officially under Bangladesh Forces as the sector in the Chittagong and Hill Tracts area, under Colonel M. A. G. Osmani, the Supreme Commander of Bangladesh Forces, of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh which had its headquarters on Theatre Road, Calcutta in India. On 30 July 1971, Ziaur Rahman was appointed the commander of the first conventional brigade of the Bangladesh Forces, which was named &quot;Z Force&quot;, after the first initial of his name. His brigade consisted of 1st, 3rd and 8th East Bengali regiments, enabling Ziaur Rahman to launch major attacks on Pakistani forces. With the Z Force, Ziaur Rahman &quot;acquired a reputation for icy bravery&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and was awarded the Bir Uttom, the second-highest military honour (and the highest for living officers) by the Government of Bangladesh.

==Assassination of Mujib in 1975 and its aftermath==

A deep conspiracy with the purpose of removing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the helm was well under way long before his assassination by outside forces and internal collaborators within Bangladesh. On 15 August 1975, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were assassinated in a gun fight with army personnel. One of Mujibur Rahman&#x27;s cabinet ministers and a leading conspirator Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad gained the presidency and dismissed Major General K M Shafiullah, who had stayed neutral during the coup. Major General Ziaur Rahman (then deputy chief of army staff) was appointed as army chief of staff, after Shafiullah resigned. However, the coup of 15 August caused a period of instability and unrest in Bangladesh and amongst the rank and file of the armed forces. Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and the 46th Brigade of Dhaka Cantonment under Colonel Shafaat Jamil revolted against Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed&#x27;s administration on 3 November 1975, and Ziaur Rahman was forced to relinquish his post and put under house arrest. This was followed on 7 November by Sipahi–Janata Revolution (&quot;Soldier–People&#x27;s Revolution&quot;), a mutiny staged by the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal (JSD or National Socialist Party) under retired Lieutenant Colonel Abu Taher and a group of socialist military officers. Khaled Mosharraf was killed by his subordinate officers while he was sheltering with them from the mutineers. Shafaat Jamil escaped but was injured, while Ziaur Rahman was freed by the 2nd Artillery Regiment under Lt. Col. Rashid and re-appointed as army chief of staff with full support of the rank and file of the army.

Following a meeting at army headquarters, an interim government was formed with Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem as chief martial law administrator and Ziaur Rahman, Air Vice Marshal M. G. Tawab and Rear Admiral M. H. Khan as his deputies. However, discipline in the army had totally collapsed and it was difficult to disarm the soldiers supported by JSD and Lt. Col. Taher, as they plotted another coup to remove Ziaur Rahman. Ziaur Rahman realised that the disorder had to be suppressed firmly if discipline was to be restored in the Bangladesh Army. Ziaur Rahman cracked down on the JSD and Gonobahini. Abu Taher was sentenced to death in July 1976 and other party figures received various terms of imprisonment. Taher was executed on 21 July 1976. Ziaur Rahman became the chief martial law administrator the same year. He tried to integrate the armed forces, giving repatriates a status appropriate to their qualifications and seniority. While this angered some veterans of the independence war, who had rapidly reached high positions following independence in 1971, Ziaur Rahman sent discontented officers on diplomatic missions abroad to defuse unrest.

==Presidency==

Ziaur Rahman became the President of Bangladesh on 21 April 1977. Years of disorder from the previous political administration of the Awami League and BAKSAL had left most of Bangladesh&#x27;s state institutions in disarray, with constant internal and external threats. After becoming president in 1977, Ziaur Rahman lifted martial law and introduced massive reforms for the development of the country.

In late September 1977, a failed coup against his administration occurred. A group of Japanese Red Army terrorists hijacked Japan Airlines Flight 472 from India, armed with weapons and ammunition and forced it to land in Tejgaon International Airport. On 30 September, while the attention of the government was riveted on this crisis situation, due to spreading of panic and disinformation actions went under way in Bogra Cantonment where a revolt broke out. Although, the revolt was quickly quelled on the night of 2 October, another revolt started in Dhaka cantonment, led by misinformed airmen of Bangladesh Air Force (BAF). Armed units from these army and air force personnel unsuccessfully attacked Zia&#x27;s residence, captured Dhaka Radio for a short time and killed eleven air force officers and 30 airmen at Tejgaon International Airport, where they were gathered for negotiations with the hijackers. Wing Commander M. Hamidullah Khan TJ, SH, BP (BDF Commander Bangladesh Forces Sector 11), then BAF Ground Defence Commander, quickly put down the rebellion within the Air Force, While, the then government was severely shaken. Chief of Air Staff AVM AG Mahmud reappointed Wing Commander Hamidullah Khan as Provost Marshal of BAF. President Zia immediately appointed Wing Commander Hamidullah Khan as ZMLA (Dhaka) and Director of Martial Law Communications and Control at Tejgaon (present day PM&#x27;s Office). Government intelligence had failed and President Ziaur Rahman promptly dismissed the DG-NSI and the DFI chief, AVM Aminul Islam Khan, of 9th GD (P) formerly coursemate of AVM A. K. Khandkar of Pakistan Air Force. Under Zia&#x27;s presidential directive, Hamidullah initiated the transfer of DFI at Old Bailey Road from the ministry of defence to Dhaka Cantonment under direct control of the president and reorganised as DGFI. In the aftermath, at least 200 soldiers involved in the coup attempt were executed following a military trial.

The size of Bangladesh police forces was doubled and the number of soldiers of the army increased from 50,000 to 90,000. In 1978, he appointed Hussain Muhammad Ershad as the new Chief of Army Staff, promoting him to the rank of lieutenant general. He was viewed as a professional soldier with no political aspirations because of his imprisonment in former West Pakistan during the Bangladesh War of Independence. Quietly Ershad rose to become Zia&#x27;s close political and military counsellor.

===Elections===
In 1978, General Ziaur Rahman ran for and an overwhelmingly won a five-year term as president. The next year elections were held for the National Assembly. Opponents questioned the integrity of the elections.

Zia allowed Sheikh Hasina, the exiled daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to return to Bangladesh in 1981.

===Domestic and foreign policies===
On taking power, Ziaur Rahman was &quot;hailed as the strict leader that the struggling nation needed&quot;. Bangladesh suffered from illiteracy, severe poverty, chronic unemployment, shortages and economic stagnation. Ziaur Rahman reversed course from his predecessor Mujib&#x27;s secular, democratic socialist, pro-Indian policies. Ziaur Rahman announced a &quot;19-point programme&quot; of economic emancipation which emphasised self-reliance, rural development, decentralisation, free markets and population control. Ziaur Rahman spent much of his time travelling throughout the country, preaching the &quot;politics of hope&quot; and urging Bangladeshis to work harder and to produce more. He held cabinet meetings all across Bangladesh. Ziaur Rahman focused on boosting agricultural and industrial production, especially in food and grains, and to integrate rural development through a variety of programmes, of which population planning was the most important. He introduced and opened the Bangladesh Jute and Rice research institutes. He launched an ambitious rural development programme in 1977, which included a highly visible and popular food-for-work programme. He promoted private sector development, exports growth and the reversing of the collectivisation of farms. His government reduced quotas and restrictions on agriculture and industrial activities. Ziaur Rahman launched major projects to construct irrigation canals, power stations, dams, roads and other public works. Directing his campaign to mobilise rural support and development, Ziaur Rahman established &quot;Gram Sarkar&quot; (&quot;Village Councils&quot;) system of self-government and the &quot;Village Defence Party&quot; system of security and crime prevention. Programmes to promote primary and adult education on a mass scale were initiated and focused mainly across rural Bangladesh. During this period, Bangladesh&#x27;s economy achieved fast economic and industrial growth.

Ziaur Rahman began reorienting Bangladesh&#x27;s foreign policy, addressing the concerns of the mostly staunch rightists coupled with some renegade leftist who believed that Bangladesh was reliant on Indian economic and military aid. Ziaur Rahman moved away from India and the Soviet bloc, his predecessors&#x27; had worked with, developing closer relations with the United States and Western Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Ziaur Rahman also moved to harmonise ties with Saudi Arabia and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Pakistan&#x27;s ally who had opposed Bangladesh&#x27;s creation and had not recognised it until 1975. Rahman moved to normalise relations with Pakistan. While distancing Bangladesh from India, Ziaur Rahman sought to improve ties with other Islamic nations. Zia&#x27;s move towards Islamic state policies improved the nation&#x27;s standing in the Middle East. According to historian Tazeen M. Murshid, one aim of these policies was to open the Gulf states to manpower exports. In this Zia was successful, and remittances became an important part of the Bangladeshi economy.

Ziaur Rahman also proposed an organisation of the nations of South Asia to bolster economic and political co-operation at a regional level. This proposal materialised in 1985 under the Presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad with the first meeting of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation in Dhaka. Zia&#x27;s vision has earned him a posthumous award from the organisation.

===Islam and Nationalism===
Ziaur Rahman believed that a massive section of the population was suffering from an identity crisis, both religious and as a people, with a very limited sense of sovereignty. To remedy this, he began a process of mixing ideologies from moderate Islam, pluralism, inclusivity, a new nationalistic ideology and some from secularism. He issued a proclamation order amending the constitution, under whose basis laws would be set in an effort to increase the self-knowledge of religion and nation. In the preamble, he inserted the salutation &quot;Bismillahir-Rahmaanir-Rahim&quot; (&quot;In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful&quot;). In Article 8(1) and 8(1A) the statement &quot;absolute trust and faith in Almighty Allah&quot;&#x27; was added, replacing the socialist commitment to secularism. Socialism was redefined as &quot;economic and social justice&quot; under his leadership. In Article 25(2), Ziaur Rahman introduced the principle that &quot;the state shall endeavour to consolidate, preserve and strengthen fraternal relations among Muslim countries based on Islamic solidarity.&quot; Some intellectuals accuse Ziaur Rahman of changing the nature of the republic from the secularism laid out by Sheikh Mujib and his supporters. However, critics of this accusation say the rationale is absurd and an oversimplification since secular leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser and Ahmed Ben Bella adopted this policy, and that religious slogans and symbolism are also used by the Awami League. Ziaur Rahman believed that Islam, as a religion, could play some role in guiding the Muslim-majority Bangladesh.

Later, Ziaur Rahman introduced Islamic religious education as a compulsory subject for Muslim schoolchildren. At the birth of Bangladesh, many Islamists had supported the Pakistani Army&#x27;s fight against independence and been barred from politics with the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order of 1972. Ziaur Rahman undid this as well as the ban on communal parties and associations, due to his commitment to multiparty democracy and political pluralism.

In public speeches and policies that he formulated, Ziaur Rahman began expounding &quot;Bangladesh Nationalism&quot;, its &quot;Sovereignty&quot;, as opposed to Mujib&#x27;s assertion of a Bengali identity based under language-based nationalism. Claiming to promote an inclusive national identity, Ziaur Rahman reached out to non-Bengali minorities such as the Santals, Garos, Manipuris and Chakmas, as well as the Urdu-speaking peoples of Bihari origin. He even amended the constitution to change the nationality of the citizens from Bengali, an ethnic identity, to Bangladeshi, a national identity, under sovereign allegiance not political belief or party affiliation.

After the formation of Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 1978, Ziaur Rahman took initiative for formation of political institutes and sponsored workshops for the youth to get active political lessons on Bangladesh nationalism. In such a workshop in September 1980, Ziaur Rahman spoke to the learners.

===Indemnity Act===

Ziaur Rahman enacted several controversial measures, some to discipline the army, some to solidify his power and some to win the support of Islamist political groups such as the Jamaat-e-Islami. Zia also facilitated the comeback of the Muslim League and other Islamic parties, appointed the highly controversial anti-independence figure Shah Azizur Rahman (who was earlier released from jail by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1973) as prime minister.

Ziaur Rahman gave foreign appointments to several men accused of assassinating Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Major Dalim, Major Rashid and Major Faruk were given jobs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in subsequent years, they were appointed ambassadors of Bangladesh to African and Middle Eastern nations.

The Indemnity Ordinance (which gave immunity from legal action to the persons involved in the assassination of president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, coups and other political events between 1975 and 1979) was proclaimed by Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad in 1975 president, ratified in the Parliament as the Indemnity Act, and incorporated as the 5th amendment to the constitution during the tenure of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.

==Assassination==

During his term of power, Ziaur Rahman was criticised for ruthless treatment of his army opposition. Although he enjoyed overall popularity and public confidence, Zia&#x27;s rehabilitation of some of the most controversial men in Bangladesh aroused fierce opposition from the supporters of the Awami League and veterans of its Mukti Bahini. Amidst speculation and fears of unrest, Ziaur Rahman went on tour to Chittagong on 29 May 1981 to help resolve an intra-party political dispute in the regional BNP. Ziaur Rahman and his entourage stayed overnight at the Chittagong Circuit House. In the early hours of the morning of 30 May, he was assassinated by a group of army officers. Also killed were six of his bodyguards and two aides.

Nearly two million people are estimated to have attended the funeral held at the Parliament Square.

== Controversies==

Many Bangladeshi politicians consider Ziaur Rahman a war hero. Ziaur Rahman is credited for ending the disorder of the final years of Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s rule and establishing democracy by abolishing BAKSAL (One party rule established by Mujib). On the other hand, Ziaur Rahman is assailed by his critics for suppressing opposition. However, Zia&#x27;s economic reforms are credited with rebuilding the economy and his move towards Islamisation brought him the support of ordinary Bangladeshi people.

=== Political debate ===

Zia&#x27;s role after 15 August 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family remains controversial. The Indemnity Act, an ordinance ordered by Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad in 1975 pardoning the subsequently convicted killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was not abolished by Rahman during his tenure as president. Some killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were sent abroad during his time as president.

=== Ascension to presidency ===

The Dhaka High Court declared the seizures of power by military coups between 1975 and 1979, including Zia&#x27;s military regime, as &quot;unlawful and unconstitutional&quot;. Zia&#x27;s martial law decrees, his ascendancy to the presidency in 1977 and the election held in 1978 were declared &quot;unknown to the constitution&quot;. The court ruling over-ruled the Indemnity Act by which these very events were accorded a legal status and enshrined in the constitution.

=== Reintroducing multi-party democracy ===

Zia rejected Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s one-party state policy and reintroduced multi-party democracy. Not only this, he also paved the way for Awami League for re-entering into politics as Awami League was out of politics after Mujib disintegrated Awami League during formation of BAKSAL (One-party based autocratic state policy) and the 1975 August Revolution (where Mujib was killed by a group of young visionary junior army officers) through which Awami League had already lost maximum public supports. During his reign Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Mujib returned Bangladesh and got chance to re-establish Awami League as a political power. He also brought Bangladesh into the Organization of Muslim Nations, a move that was widely welcomed by the general public. However, many historians argue that these actions might have alienated Bangladesh&#x27;s tribal and religious minorities.

=== Suppression of opposition ===

During Ziaur Rahman&#x27;s regime, at least 20 military coup attempts took place. It is claimed that many soldiers and military officials either disappeared or were killed during Zia&#x27;s reigme. On one occasion, about 1,143 people were hanged in various Bangladeshi prisons, on charges of participating in a failed coup attempt on 2 October 1977.

== Personal life and family ==

With Khaleda Zia, Ziaur Rahman had two sons, Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman (d. 2015). Khaleda became the head of the BNP and organised a coalition of political parties opposed to Ershad&#x27;s regime. In elections held in 1991, she led the BNP to victory and became the first female prime minister of Bangladesh. She lost the 1996 elections to the Awami League&#x27;s Sheikh Hasina, but returned to power in 2001. Tarique served as the acting chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

==Legacy, awards and honours==

Bangladesh Nationalist Party continues to hold this legacy and many things named after him after his death.

<text>NCSA HTTPd is an early, now discontinued, web server originally developed at the NCSA at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign by Robert McCool and others. First released in 1993, it was among the earliest web servers developed, following Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s CERN httpd, Tony Sanders&#x27; Plexus server, and some others. It was for some time the natural counterpart to the Mosaic web browser in the client–server World Wide Web. It also introduced the Common Gateway Interface, allowing for the creation of dynamic websites.

After Robert McCool left NCSA in mid-1994, the development of NCSA HTTPd slowed greatly. An independent effort, the Apache project, took the codebase and continued; meanwhile, NCSA released one more version (1.5), then ceased development. In August 1995, NCSA HTTPd powered most of all web servers on the Internet; nearly all of them quickly switched over to Apache. By April 1996, Apache passed NCSA HTTPd as the No. 1 server on the Internet, and retained that position until mid-to-late 2016.

<doc id="308469" wikidata="Q554949" url="?curid=308469" title="Lanza del Vasto">
<text>Lanza del Vasto (born Giuseppe Giovanni Luigi Maria Enrico Lanza di Trabia-Branciforte; 29 September 1901 – 6 January 1981) was an Italian philosopher, poet, artist, Catholic and nonviolent activist.

He was born in San Vito dei Normanni, Italy and died in Murcia, Spain.

A western disciple of Mohandas K. Gandhi, he worked for inter-religious dialogue, spiritual renewal, ecological activism and nonviolence.

== Youth in Italy ==
His father, Don Luigi Giuseppe Lanza di Trabia-Branciforte, was Sicilian and his mother, Anne-Marie Henriette Nauts-Oedenkoven, was born in Antwerp, in Belgium. Very early he traveled in Italy and Europe. He entered the University of Pisa in 1922.

== Meeting Gandhi ==
In December 1936, Lanza went to India, joining the movement for Indian independence led by Gandhi. He knew of Gandhi through a book by Romain Rolland. He spent six months with the Mahatma, then in June 1937, went to the sources of the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers in the Himalayas, a famous pilgrimage site. There he saw a vision which told him &quot;Go back and found!&quot;

He then returned to Europe. In 1938, he went to Palestine, then in the midst of civil war, to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, &quot;between two lines of tanks&quot;.

He came back to Paris at the time when the Second World War started. He wrote some books of poetry and in 1943 published the story of his trip to India, &quot;Return to the Source&quot;, which became a huge success.

== Foundation of the Ark ==
He founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 which first met with many difficulties. In 1954, he returned to India to participate in nonviolent anti-feudal struggles with Vinoba Bhave.

In 1962, the Community of the Ark settled in Haut-Languedoc, in the south of France, at &quot;La Borie Noble&quot;, near Lodève, in a deserted village. After numbering over a hundred members in the 1970s and 1980s, some communities were closed in the 1990s due to conflicts, ageing population (under thirty members) and a lack of interest in their work and lifestyle. Since 2000, groups are present in a few regions of France, in Belgium, Spain, Italy, Ecuador and Canada.

== Nonviolent activism ==
In 1957, during the Algerian War, del Vasto started with other well-known people (General de Bollardière, François Mauriac, Robert Barrat, etc.) a movement of protest against torture. He fasted for 21 days. In 1958, he demonstrated against the nuclear power plant in Marcoule, France, which produced plutonium for nuclear weapons.

In 1963, he fasted for 40 days in Rome during the Second Vatican Council, asking Pope John XXIII to stand against war - &quot;Pour demander au Pape de prendre position contre la guerre.&quot;

In 1965, he was at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina, talking about non-violence during weeks with the students.
In 1972, he supported the farmers of the Larzac plateau against the extension of a military base while fasting for 15 days. In 1974, a community of the Ark settled in the Larzac in a farmhouse bought by the army.

In 1976, he participated in the demonstrations against the building of the fast breeder reactor Superphénix at Creys-Malville, Isère (France).

==Death==
In January 1981, del Vasto was working to found a new community in Elche de la Sierra, in the Spanish province of Albacete, when on 5 January, he had a brain hemorrhage and was taken to the hospital of Ciudad Sanitaria Virgen de La Arrixaca in Murcia. He died there on 6 Jan.

<doc id="308474" wikidata="Q734737" url="?curid=308474" title="Non-uniform rational B-spline">
<text>Non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) is a mathematical model using basis splines (B-splines) that is commonly used in computer graphics for representing curves and surfaces. It offers great flexibility and precision for handling both analytic (defined by common mathematical formulae) and modeled shapes. It is a type of curve modeling, as opposed to polygonal modeling or digital sculpting. NURBS curves are commonly used in computer-aided design (CAD), manufacturing (CAM), and engineering (CAE). They are part of numerous industry-wide standards, such as IGES, STEP, ACIS, and PHIGS. Tools for creating and editing NURBS surfaces are found in various 3D graphics, rendering, and animation software packages.

They can be efficiently handled by computer programs yet allow for easy human interaction. NURBS surfaces are functions of two parameters mapping to a surface in three-dimensional space. The shape of the surface is determined by control points. In a compact form, NURBS surfaces can represent simple geometrical shapes. For complex organic shapes, T-splines and subdivision surfaces are more suitable because they halve the number of control points in comparison with the NURBS surfaces.

In general, editing NURBS curves and surfaces is intuitive and predictable. Control points are always either connected directly to the curve or surface, or else act as if they were connected by a rubber band. Depending on the type of user interface, the editing of NURBS curves and surfaces can be via their control points (similar to Bézier curves) or via higher level tools such as &quot;spline modeling&quot; and &quot;hierarchical editing&quot;.

== History ==

Before computers, designs were drawn by hand on paper with various drafting tools. Rulers were used for straight lines, compasses for circles, and protractors for angles. But many shapes, such as the freeform curve of a ship&#x27;s bow, could not be drawn with these tools. 

Although such curves could be drawn freehand at the drafting board, shipbuilders often needed a life-size version which could not be done by hand. Such large drawings were done with the help of flexible strips of wood, called splines. The splines were held in place at a number of predetermined points, by lead &quot;ducks&quot;, named for the bill-shaped protrusion that the splines rested against. Between the ducks, the elasticity of the spline material caused the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy of bending, thus creating the smoothest possible shape that fit the constraints. The shape could be adjusted by moving the ducks.

In 1946, mathematicians started studying the spline shape, and derived the piecewise polynomial formula known as the spline curve or spline function. I. J. Schoenberg gave the spline function its name after its resemblance to the mechanical spline used by draftsmen.

As computers were introduced into the design process, the physical properties of such splines were investigated so that they could be modelled with mathematical precision and reproduced where needed. Pioneering work was done in France by Renault engineer Pierre Bézier, and Citroën&#x27;s physicist and mathematician Paul de Casteljau. They worked nearly parallel to each other, but because Bézier published the results of his work, Bézier curves were named after him, while de Casteljau&#x27;s name is only associated with related algorithms.

NURBS were initially used only in the proprietary CAD packages of car companies. Later they became part of standard computer graphics packages.

Real-time, interactive rendering of NURBS curves and surfaces was first made commercially available on Silicon Graphics workstations in 1989. In 1993, the first interactive NURBS modeller for PCs, called NöRBS, was developed by CAS Berlin, a small startup company cooperating with Technische Universität Berlin.

== Continuity ==

A surface under construction, e.g. the hull of a motor yacht, is usually composed of several NURBS surfaces known as NURBS patches (or just &quot;patches&quot;). These surface patches should be fitted together in such a way that the boundaries are invisible. This is mathematically expressed by the concept of geometric continuity.

Higher-level tools exist that benefit from the ability of NURBS to create and establish geometric continuity of different levels:
* Positional continuity (G0) holds whenever the end positions of two curves or surfaces coincide. The curves or surfaces may still meet at an angle, giving rise to a sharp corner or edge and causing broken highlights.
* Tangential continuity (G¹) requires the end vectors of the curves or surfaces to be parallel and pointing the same way, ruling out sharp edges. Because highlights falling on a tangentially continuous edge are always continuous and thus look natural, this level of continuity can often be sufficient.
* Curvature continuity (G²) further requires the end vectors to be of the same length and rate of length change. Highlights falling on a curvature-continuous edge do not display any change, causing the two surfaces to appear as one. This can be visually recognized as &quot;perfectly smooth&quot;. This level of continuity is very useful in the creation of models that require many bi-cubic patches composing one continuous surface.

Geometric continuity mainly refers to the shape of the resulting surface; since NURBS surfaces are functions, it is also possible to discuss the derivatives of the surface with respect to the parameters. This is known as parametric continuity. Parametric continuity of a given degree implies geometric continuity of that degree.

First- and second-level parametric continuity (C0 and C¹) are for practical purposes identical to positional and tangential (G0 and G¹) continuity. Third-level parametric continuity (C²), however, differs from curvature continuity in that its parameterization is also continuous. In practice, C² continuity is easier to achieve if uniform B-splines are used.

The definition of C&quot;n&quot; continuity requires that the &quot;n&quot;th derivative of adjacent curves/surfaces (formula_1) are equal at a joint. Note that the (partial) derivatives of curves and surfaces are vectors that have a direction and a magnitude; both should be equal.

Highlights and reflections can reveal the perfect smoothing, which is otherwise practically impossible to achieve without NURBS surfaces that have at least G² continuity. This same principle is used as one of the surface evaluation methods whereby a ray-traced or reflection-mapped image of a surface with white stripes reflecting on it will show even the smallest deviations on a surface or set of surfaces. This method is derived from car prototyping wherein surface quality is inspected by checking the quality of reflections of a neon-light ceiling on the car surface. This method is also known as &quot;Zebra analysis&quot;.

== Technical specifications ==

A NURBS curve is defined by its order, a set of weighted control points, and a knot vector. NURBS curves and surfaces are generalizations of both B-splines and Bézier curves and surfaces, the primary difference being the weighting of the control points, which makes NURBS curves &quot;rational&quot;. 

(&quot;Non-rational&quot;, aka &quot;simple&quot;, B-splines are a special case/subset of rational B-splines, where each control point is a regular non-homogenous coordinate [no &#x27;w&#x27;] rather than a homogeneous coordinate. That is equivalent to having weight &quot;1&quot; at each control point; &quot;Rational&quot; B-splines use the &#x27;w&#x27; of each control point as a weight.)

By using a two-dimensional grid of control points, NURBS surfaces including planar patches and sections of spheres can be created. These are parametrized with two variables (typically called &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; or &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;). This can be extended to arbitrary dimensions to create NURBS mapping formula_2.

NURBS curves and surfaces are useful for a number of reasons:
* The set of NURBS for a given order is invariant under affine transformations: operations like rotations and translations can be applied to NURBS curves and surfaces by applying them to their control points.
* They offer one common mathematical form for both standard analytical shapes (e.g., conics) and free-form shapes.
* They provide the flexibility to design a large variety of shapes.
* They reduce the memory consumption when storing shapes (compared to simpler methods).
* They can be evaluated reasonably quickly by numerically stable and accurate algorithms.

Here, NURBS is mostly discussed in one dimension (curves); it can be generalized to two (surfaces) or even more dimensions.

=== Order ===
The &quot;order&quot; of a NURBS curve defines the number of nearby control points that influence any given point on the curve. The curve is represented mathematically by a polynomial of degree one less than the order of the curve. Hence, second-order curves (which are represented by linear polynomials) are called linear curves, third-order curves are called quadratic curves, and fourth-order curves are called cubic curves. The number of control points must be greater than or equal to the order of the curve.

In practice, cubic curves are the ones most commonly used. Fifth- and sixth-order curves are sometimes useful, especially for obtaining continuous higher order derivatives, but curves of higher orders are practically never used because they lead to internal numerical problems and tend to require disproportionately large calculation times.

=== Control points ===

The control points determine the shape of the curve. Typically, each point of the curve is computed by taking a weighted sum of a number of control points. The weight of each point varies according to the governing parameter. For a curve of degree d, the weight of any control point is only nonzero in d+1 intervals of the parameter space. Within those intervals, the weight changes according to a polynomial function (&quot;basis functions&quot;) of degree d. At the boundaries of the intervals, the basis functions go smoothly to zero, the smoothness being determined by the degree of the polynomial.

As an example, the basis function of degree one is a triangle function. It rises from zero to one, then falls to zero again. While it rises, the basis function of the previous control point falls. In that way, the curve interpolates between the two points, and the resulting curve is a polygon, which is continuous, but not differentiable at the interval boundaries, or knots. Higher degree polynomials have correspondingly more continuous derivatives. Note that within the interval the polynomial nature of the basis functions and the linearity of the construction make the curve perfectly smooth, so it is only at the knots that discontinuity can arise.

In many applications the fact that a single control point only influences those intervals where it is active is a highly desirable property, known as local support. In modeling, it allows the changing of one part of a surface while keeping other parts unchanged.

Adding more control points allows better approximation to a given curve, although only a certain class of curves can be represented exactly with a finite number of control points. NURBS curves also feature a scalar weight for each control point. This allows for more control over the shape of the curve without unduly raising the number of control points. In particular, it adds conic sections like circles and ellipses to the set of curves that can be represented exactly. The term &quot;rational&quot; in NURBS refers to these weights.

The control points can have any dimensionality. One-dimensional points just define a scalar function of the parameter. These are typically used in image processing programs to tune the brightness and color curves. Three-dimensional control points are used abundantly in 3D modeling, where they are used in the everyday meaning of the word &#x27;point&#x27;, a location in 3D space.
Multi-dimensional points might be used to control sets of time-driven values, e.g. the different positional and rotational settings of a robot arm. NURBS surfaces are just an application of this. Each control &#x27;point&#x27; is actually a full vector of control points, defining a curve. These curves share their degree and the number of control points, and span one dimension of the parameter space. By interpolating these control vectors over the other dimension of the parameter space, a continuous set of curves is obtained, defining the surface.

=== Knot vector ===
The knot vector is a sequence of parameter values that determines where and how the control points affect the NURBS curve. The number of knots is always equal to the number of control points plus curve degree plus one (i.e. number of control points plus curve order). The knot vector divides the parametric space in the intervals mentioned before, usually referred to as &quot;knot spans&quot;. Each time the parameter value enters a new knot span, a new control point becomes active, while an old control point is discarded.
It follows that the values in the knot vector should be in nondecreasing order, so (0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3) is valid while (0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 3) is not.

Consecutive knots can have the same value. This then defines a knot span of zero length, which implies that two control points are activated at the same time (and of course two control points become deactivated). This has impact on continuity of the resulting curve or its higher derivatives; for instance, it allows the creation of corners in an otherwise smooth NURBS curve.
A number of coinciding knots is sometimes referred to as a knot with a certain multiplicity. Knots with multiplicity two or three are known as double or triple knots.
The multiplicity of a knot is limited to the degree of the curve; since a higher multiplicity would split the curve into disjoint parts and it would leave control points unused. For first-degree NURBS, each knot is paired with a control point.

The knot vector usually starts with a knot that has multiplicity equal to the order. This makes sense, since this activates the control points that have influence on the first knot span. Similarly, the knot vector usually ends with a knot of that multiplicity.
Curves with such knot vectors start and end in a control point.

The values of the knots control the mapping between the input parameter and the corresponding NURBS value. For example, if a NURBS describes a path through space over time, the knots control the time that the function proceeds past the control points. For the purposes of representing shapes, however, only the ratios of the difference between the knot values matter; in that case, the knot vectors (0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3) and (0, 0, 2, 4, 6, 6) produce the same curve. The positions of the knot values influences the mapping of parameter space to curve space. Rendering a NURBS curve is usually done by stepping with a fixed stride through the parameter range. By changing the knot span lengths, more sample points can be used in regions where the curvature is high. Another use is in situations where the parameter value has some physical significance, for instance if the parameter is time and the curve describes the motion of a robot arm. The knot span lengths then translate into velocity and acceleration, which are essential to get right to prevent damage to the robot arm or its environment. This flexibility in the mapping is what the phrase &quot;non uniform&quot; in NURBS refers to.

Necessary only for internal calculations, knots are usually not helpful to the users of modeling software. Therefore, many modeling applications do not make the knots editable or even visible. It&#x27;s usually possible to establish reasonable knot vectors by looking at the variation in the control points. More recent versions of NURBS software (e.g., Autodesk Maya and Rhinoceros 3D) allow for interactive editing of knot positions, but this is significantly less intuitive than the editing of control points.

=== Construction of the basis functions ===
The B-spline basis functions used in the construction of NURBS curves are usually denoted as formula_3, in which formula_4 corresponds to the formula_4-th control point, and formula_6 corresponds with the degree of the basis function. The parameter dependence is frequently left out, so we can write 
The definition of these basis functions is recursive in formula_6.
The degree-0 functions formula_8 are piecewise constant functions. They are one on the corresponding knot span and zero everywhere else.
Effectively, formula_9 is a linear interpolation of formula_10 and formula_11. The latter two functions are non-zero for formula_6 knot spans, overlapping for formula_13 knot spans. The function formula_9 is computed as

formula_15
formula_16 rises linearly from zero to one on the interval where formula_10 is non-zero, while formula_18 falls from one to zero on the interval where formula_11 is non-zero. As mentioned before, formula_20 is a triangular function, nonzero over two knot spans rising from zero to one on the first, and falling to zero on the second knot span. Higher order basis functions are non-zero over corresponding more knot spans and have correspondingly higher degree. If formula_21 is the parameter, and formula_22 is the formula_4th knot, we can write the functions formula_24 and formula_25 as
formula_26
and
formula_27
The functions formula_24 and formula_25 are positive when the corresponding lower order basis functions are non-zero. By induction on n it follows that the basis functions are non-negative for all values of formula_6 and formula_21. This makes the computation of the basis functions numerically stable.

Again by induction, it can be proved that the sum of the basis functions for a particular value of the parameter is unity. This is known as the partition of unity property of the basis functions.


The figures show the linear and the quadratic basis functions for the knots {..., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, ...}

One knot span is considerably shorter than the others. On that knot span, the peak in the quadratic basis function is more distinct, reaching almost one. Conversely, the adjoining basis functions fall to zero more quickly. In the geometrical interpretation, this means that the curve approaches the corresponding control point closely. In case of a double knot, the length of the knot span becomes zero and the peak reaches one exactly. The basis function is no longer differentiable at that point. The curve will have a sharp corner if the neighbour control points are not collinear.

=== General form of a NURBS curve ===

Using the definitions of the basis functions formula_9 from the previous paragraph, a NURBS curve takes the following form:
formula_33

In this, formula_34 is the number of control points formula_35 and formula_36 are the corresponding weights. The denominator is a normalizing factor that evaluates to one if all weights are one. This can be seen from the partition of unity property of the basis functions. It is customary to write this as
formula_37
in which the functions
formula_38
are known as the &quot;rational basis functions&quot;.

=== General form of a NURBS surface ===

A NURBS surface is obtained as the tensor product of two NURBS curves, thus using two independent parameters formula_21 and formula_40 (with indices formula_4 and formula_42 respectively):
formula_43
with
formula_44
as rational basis functions.

== Manipulating NURBS objects ==

A number of transformations can be applied to a NURBS object. For instance, if some curve is defined using a certain degree and N control points, the same curve can be expressed using the same degree and N+1 control points. In the process a number of control points change position and a knot is inserted in the knot vector.
These manipulations are used extensively during interactive design. When adding a control point, the shape of the curve should stay the same, forming the starting point for further adjustments. A number of these operations are discussed below.

=== Knot insertion ===
As the term suggests, knot insertion inserts a knot into the knot vector. If the degree of the curve is formula_6, then formula_13 control points are replaced by formula_6 new ones. The shape of the curve stays the same.

A knot can be inserted multiple times, up to the maximum multiplicity of the knot. This is sometimes referred to as knot refinement and can be achieved by an algorithm that is more efficient than repeated knot insertion.

=== Knot removal ===
Knot removal is the reverse of knot insertion. Its purpose is to remove knots and the associated control points in order to get a more compact representation. Obviously, this is not always possible while retaining the exact shape of the curve. In practice, a tolerance in the accuracy is used to determine whether a knot can be removed. The process is used to clean up after an interactive session in which control points may have been added manually, or after importing
a curve from a different representation, where a straightforward conversion process leads to redundant control points.

=== Degree elevation ===
A NURBS curve of a particular degree can always be represented by a NURBS curve of higher degree. This is frequently used when combining separate NURBS curves,
e.g., when creating a NURBS surface interpolating between a set of NURBS curves or when unifying adjacent curves. In the process, the different curves should be brought to the same degree, usually the maximum degree of the set of curves. The process is known as degree elevation.

=== Curvature ===
The most important property in differential geometry is the curvature formula_48. It describes the local properties (edges, corners, etc.) and relations between the first and second derivative, and thus, the precise curve shape. Having determined the derivatives it is easy to compute formula_49. The circle is composed of four quarter circles, tied together with double knots. Although double knots in a third order NURBS curve would normally result in loss of continuity in the first derivative, the control points are positioned in such a way that the first derivative is continuous. In fact, the curve is infinitely differentiable everywhere, as it must be if it exactly represents a circle.

The curve represents a circle exactly, but it is not exactly parametrized in the circle&#x27;s arc length. This means, for example, that the point at formula_50 does not lie at formula_51 (except for the start, middle and end point of each quarter circle, since the representation is symmetrical). This would be impossible, since the &quot;x&quot; coordinate of the circle would provide an exact rational polynomial expression for formula_52, which is impossible. The circle does make one full revolution as its parameter formula_50 goes from 0 to formula_54, but this is only because the knot vector was arbitrarily chosen as multiples of formula_55.

<text>Marcus Verrius Flaccus (c. 55 BCAD 20) was a Roman grammarian and teacher who flourished under Augustus and Tiberius.

==Life==

He was a freedman, and his manumitter has been identified with Verrius Flaccus, an authority on pontifical law; but for chronological reasons the name of Veranius Flaccus, a writer on augury, has been suggested (Teuffel-Schwabe, &quot;Hist. of Roman Lit.&quot; 199, 4). He gained such a reputation by his methods of instruction that he was summoned to court to bring up Gaius and Lucius, the grandsons of Augustus. He moved there with his whole school, and his salary was greatly increased on the condition that he took no fresh pupils. He died at an advanced age during the reign of Tiberius (Suetonius, &quot;De Grammaticis&quot;, 17), and a statue in his honour was erected at Praeneste, in a marble recess, with inscriptions from his &quot;Fasti Praenestini&quot;.

==Works==

Flaccus was also a distinguished philologist and antiquarian investigator. His most important work, &quot;De verborum significatu&quot;, was the first major alphabetical dictionary in Latin. Though only small fragments remain of the work, it served as the basis for Sextus Pompeius Festus&#x27;s epitome, also called &quot;De verborum significatu&quot;. Festus&#x27;s work was in turn abridged centuries later by Paul the Deacon for the library of Charlemagne. Of the calendar of Roman festivals (&quot;Fasti Praenestini&quot;) engraved on marble and set up in the forum at Praeneste, some fragments were discovered (1771) at some distance from the town itself in a Christian building of later date, and some consular &quot;fasti&quot; in the forum itself (1778). The collection was subsequently increased by two new fragments.

Other lost works of Flaccus include:
*&quot;De Orthographia: De Obscuris Catonis&quot;, an elucidation of obscurities in the writings of Cato the Elder
*&quot;Saturnus&quot;, dealing with questions of Roman ritual
*&quot;Rerum memoria dignarum libri&quot;, an encyclopaedic work much used by Pliny the Elder
*&quot;Res Etruscae&quot;, probably on augury.

<text>The Daily Star is a tabloid newspaper published from Monday to Saturday in the United Kingdom since 1978. In 2002, a sister Sunday edition, &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot; was launched with a separate staff. On May 6, 2020, &quot;The Star&quot; published its 10,000th issue. Jon Clark is the editor-in-chief of the paper, while Andrew Gilpin is editor of the web version.

When the paper was launched from Manchester, it was circulated only in the North and Midlands. It was conceived by the then-owners of Express Newspapers, Trafalgar House, to take on the strength of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; in the North. It was also intended to use the under-capacity of the Great Ancoats Street presses in Manchester as the &quot;Daily Express&quot; was losing circulation. The &quot;Daily Star&quot; sold out its first night print of 1,400,000. Its cover price has decreased over the years to compete with its rival &quot;The Sun&quot;.

The &quot;Daily Star&quot; is published by Reach plc. The paper has predominantly focused on stories revolving around celebrities, sport, and news/gossip about popular television programs, such as soap operas and reality TV shows, though in recent times has also criticized what it sees as woke culture.

== History ==
The &quot;Daily Star&quot; was originally created in 1978 as part of Express Newspapers to utilize printing presses that had been running under capacity due to falling &quot;Daily Express&quot; circulation. It was acquired in 2000 by Northern &amp; Shell, and sold to Reach plc in 2018.

==Regular features==
For over 40 years, the newspaper regularly featured a photograph of a topless glamour model (called a &quot;Star Babe&quot;) on weekdays, in a similar vein to &quot;The Sun&quot;″s former Page 3 feature. The feature discovered some well-known models, most notably Rachel ter Horst in 1993 and Lucy Pinder in 2003. In April 2019, the paper claimed it changed from publishing topless models on its third page to publishing clothed glamour images. It also claimed it was the last mainstream British tabloid to discontinue the tradition of printing topless images, after &quot;The Sun&quot; ended its own Page 3 feature in 2015. The paper&#x27;s glamour photographer is Jeany Savage.

Other regular features in the &quot;Daily Star&quot; include Wired, a daily gossip column edited by James Cabooter, &quot;Hot TV&quot;, a television news column edited by Ed Gleave and Peter Dyke, Mike Ward&#x27;s weekly television review page and &quot;Forum&quot;, a daily page devoted to readers&#x27; text messages, which are apparently printed verbatim. Opinion columns by Dominik Diamond and Vanessa Feltz were discontinued in 2008. Until he died in 2012, the chief football writer was Brian Woolnough, lured from &quot;The Sun&quot; in 2001 for a £200,000 pay packet.

The paper&#x27;s leader column, entitled &quot;The Daily Star Says&quot;, appears most days on Page 6.

==Controversies==

===Jeffrey Archer===
In 1987, the newspaper lost a high-profile libel action brought by Jeffrey Archer, leading to an award of £500,000 in damages, over allegations of Archer&#x27;s involvement with a prostitute, Monica Coghlan. The editor of the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial. However, the newspaper always stood by its story, and on 19 July 2001 Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the 1987 trial and was sentenced to a total of four years&#x27; imprisonment. The paper later launched a bid to reclaim £2.2 million – the original payout plus interest and damages. In October 2002, it was reported that this action had been settled with an out of court payment of £1.5 million by Archer.

===Hillsborough disaster===
On 18 April 1989, three days after the Hillsborough disaster in which 97 Liverpool fans were fatally injured at an FA Cup semi-final game, the &quot;Daily Star&quot; ran the front-page headline &quot;Dead Fans Robbed by Drunk Thugs&quot;, alleging that Liverpool fans had stolen from fans injured or killed in the tragedy. These allegations, along with claims that fans had also attacked police officers aiding the injured, were published in several other newspapers, though it was the content of coverage by &quot;The Sun&quot; — particularly a front-page article on 19 April — that caused the most controversy. A later inquiry showed all of the claims made were false.

===Madeleine McCann===
Both the &quot;Daily Star&quot; and its Sunday equivalent, as well as its stablemates the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, featured heavy coverage of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in May 2007. In 2008, the McCann family sued the &quot;Star&quot; and &quot;Express&quot; for libel. The action concerned more than 100 stories across the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;Daily Star&quot; and their Sunday equivalents, which accused the McCanns of involvement in their daughter&#x27;s disappearance. The newspapers&#x27; coverage was regarded by the McCanns as grossly defamatory. In a settlement at the High Court of Justice, the newspapers agreed to run a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, publish another apology on the front pages of the Sunday editions on 23 March and make a statement of apology at the High Court. They also agreed to pay costs and substantial damages, which the McCanns plan to use to aid their search for their daughter. The &quot;Daily Star&quot; apologised for printing &quot;stories suggesting the couple were responsible for, or may be responsible for, the death of their daughter Madeleine and for covering it up&quot; and stated that &quot;We now recognise that such a suggestion is absolutely untrue and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter&#x27;s disappearance&quot;.

===Volcanic ash front page===
On 21 April 2010, in the aftermath of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, the &quot;Star&quot; published a computer-generated image on its front page of British Airways Flight 9, which in 1982 encountered volcanic ash and suffered the temporary loss of all engines. The image, taken from a documentary, was accompanied by a headline &quot;Terror as plane hits ash cloud&quot;, without any indication on the front page that the image was computer-generated. The splash, on the first day that flights restarted after a six-day closure of UK airspace due to volcanic ash, led to the removal of the paper from newsagents at some UK airports.

===&quot;Grand Theft Auto Rothbury&quot;===
On 21 July 2010, the paper ran a story by Jerry Lawton claiming that Rockstar Games was planning an instalment of its &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series of video games based around the then-recent shootings carried out by Raoul Moat. Amid outcry at the inaccuracy of the story, an apology was published by the paper on 24 July for making no attempt to verify the truth of any of the claims, publishing what was claimed to be the cover, criticising Rockstar for its alleged plans without questioning the likelihood, making no attempt to contact Rockstar before publishing, and obtaining statements from a grieving relative of one of Moat&#x27;s victims. The paper claimed to have paid &quot;substantial&quot; damages to Rockstar as a result, which Rockstar donated to charity.

Prior to the paper&#x27;s apology, Lawton defended his story on his Facebook page, claiming to be &quot;baffled by the fury of adult gamers&quot;, describing them as &quot;grown (?!?) men who sit around all day playing computer games with one another&quot;. He then added &quot;Think I&#x27;ll challenge them to a virtual reality duel...stab...I win!&quot;.

===Richard Peppiatt resignation===
In March 2011, reporter Richard Peppiatt quit the &quot;Daily Star&quot; after accusing them of Islamophobic and pro-English Defence League (EDL) coverage: &quot;The lies of a newspaper in London can get a bloke&#x27;s head caved-in down an alley in Bradford&quot;. He admitted to writing false stories about celebrities and alleged they were ordered by superiors. All of his allegations were denied by the newspaper.

=== Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson interview fabrication ===
On 11 January 2019, the paper published a front-page article, in which it is claimed that Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson had stated &quot;generation snowflake or, whatever you want to call them, are actually putting us backwards&quot;, referring to the millennial generation, and &quot;if you are not agreeing with them then they are offended – and that is not what so many great men and women fought for&quot;. In response, Dwayne Johnson stated that the article was &quot;completely untrue, 100% fabricated&quot;, and &quot;never took place&quot; through his Instagram and Twitter pages, later causing the &quot;Daily Star&quot; to take the article offline.

=== Five Inch Naval Gun ===
On July 29, 2016, the paper published an article saying that the MOD spent &quot;183 Million Pounds for a Five Inch Gun&quot; for the Royal Navy. They further quoted the MOD as saying it was &quot;A good value for the taxpayers.&quot; The article criticized the MOD about a gun the, &quot;size of a toothbrush.&quot; The Star was mistakenly thinking the length of the barrel was Five Inches, although it is the size of the Bore that is Five Inches. A subsequent article was published with the correct information without explaining the first articles errors.

== Liz Truss lettuce publicity stunt ==
On 14 October 2022, the &quot;Daily Star&quot; set up a livestream on whether or not Liz Truss&#x27;s premiership would outlast the ten-day shelf life of a lettuce, after &quot;The Economist&quot; described her as having &quot;the shelf-life of a lettuce&quot; amidst a government crisis. When Truss announced her resignation six days later on 20 October, it was played on the stream followed by &quot;God Save the King&quot; and celebratory music, declaring that &quot;the lettuce outlasted Liz Truss&quot;.

==Editors==

* 2018–present: Jon Clark

==Political allegiance==
The paper was originally created with a pro-Labour stance. Ahead of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the Scottish edition named the &quot;Daily Star of Scotland&quot; printed articles in support of the Better Together campaign. In a retrospective of the newspaper in 2018, journalist and former &quot;Daily Star&quot; features editor Roy Greenslade described the publication under the ownership of Richard Desmond as being &quot;a newspaper without either news or views. If it can be said to have any political outlook at all, then it is rightwing. There is no passion, no commitment, no soul.&quot;

Since being taken over by Reach in 2018 and under the editorship of Jon Clark, the publication has taken a more humour-focused direction, with Ian Burrell of the &quot;i&quot; newspaper describing the publication in 2020 as an &quot;unlikely source of satire&quot; contrasting it with the paper under the prior ownership of Desmond, which he described as a &quot;mostly a sordid product that objectified women and obsessed over reality TV&quot;. Clark described the publication&#x27;s political position thus: &quot;We have no interest in whether you are a Tory or a Labour supporter but I want our elected leaders to do right by the electorate and they are not, they are lying to us. The best way to hold them to account is by taking the piss out of them. It&#x27;s hard to come back from being a figure of fun.&quot;

<doc id="308485" wikidata="Q222735" url="?curid=308485" title="Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia">
<text>Ezzo ( – 21 March 1034), sometimes called Ehrenfried, a member of the Ezzonid dynasty, was Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1015 until his death. As brother-in-law of Emperor Otto III, father of Queen Richeza of Poland and several other illustrious children, he was one of the most important figures of the Rhenish history of his time.

==Life==
Ezzo was the son of the Lotharingian count palatine Herman I and his wife Heylwig of Dillingen. He was sent as a child to be educated by Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg (episcopate 923–973), a relative of his mother. Nothing is known about his youth.

Having married Matilda of Germany (died 1025), a daughter of Emperor Otto II and his consort Theophanu, Ezzo became prominent during the reign of his brother-in-law, Emperor Otto III. The marriage was expressly consented by the Dowager Empress Theophanu, probably to rally the powerful family of Ezzo to the throne. Matilda received as dowry out of Ottonian possessions lands in Thuringia and in the Duchy of Franconia (Orlamünde and the East Franconian territories of Coburg and Salz), while her husband gave her as dowry the family estate of Brauweiler near Cologne.

At the death of his father in 996, Herman&#x27;s rich allodial property was shared between his sons. Ezzo received lands in Cochem on the Mosel river, in Maifeld, the Flamersheimer Wald and estates around Tomburg Castle near Rheinbach, as well as half the usufruct of Villewaldin. About the same time, he must have received the Palatinate and previous comital rights, as he is referred as count in the &quot;Auelgau&quot; in 1015 and as Count Palatine in the &quot;Bonngau&quot; in 1020. He also received the county of &quot;Ruhrgau&quot; with tutelage of Essen Abbey.

Unsuccessful candidate to the imperial throne upon the death of Emperor Otto III in 1002, his relation with the new Ottonian king Henry II was immediately very tense. Henry disputed Ezzo&#x27;s ownership of territories, that he defended as his wife&#x27;s inheritance of late Otto III. The conflict dragged on for years and reached its peak in 1011. Facing disturbances in Lotharingia, and in need for Ezzo&#x27;s military support, Henry was forced to come to terms. Ezzo&#x27;s victory led the king to make concessions and to a complete transformation of its policy. He reconciled with Ezzo, recognized its rights of inheritance and gave him the royal territories of Kaiserswerth, Duisburg as well as Saalfeld in Thuringia for renouncing to the throne. He also associated the Ezzonid dynasty to his Eastern policies, and mediated the marriage of Ezzo&#x27;s daughter Richeza with the heir to the Polish throne Mieszko II Lambert.
These huge territorial concessions made Ezzo one of the most powerful princes in the Empire. Ezzo&#x27;s growing power and the increased prestige of his house were reflected in the founding of the family, Brauweiler Abbey, the place where his marriage had been celebrated and whose construction begun after a trip to Rome of the couple in 1024. The Benedictine monastery, which was consecrated in 1028 by Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne, was to be the grave and spiritual centre of the Ezzonid dynasty. 

Henry II died in July 1024 without an heir. Conrad, a great-grandson of Liutgard of Saxony, daughter of Otto I, was elected King of the Romans. In November 1025, Ezzo, who was a supporter of Conrad, invited the Lotharingian nobles to Aachen where they paid homage to the new king, included some, such as Pilgrim, (archbishop of Cologne), who had previously withheld their support. Ezzo&#x27;s wife Matilda died unexpectedly during a visit to Ezzo&#x27;s brother Hermann in Echtz, while Ezzo was in Aachen. She was buried at Brauweiler Abbey.

Very little is known about Ezzo&#x27;s later life, but we are told that he died at a great age at Saalfeld on 21 March 1034, and was buried in Brauweiler.

Ezzo life and offices are described in the &quot;Fundatio monasterii Brunwilarensis&quot;. He was mostly active in political affairs when it came to his own interests and the standing of his house, and where he could increase his territories and authority. His management of the favours of Empress Theophano, Emperor Otto III and later Henry II, testify of his personal ambition and political dexterity.

==Children==

*Liudolf (c. 1000–10 April 1031), Count of Zütphen.
*Otto II (died 1047), Count Palatine of Lotharingia and later Duke of Swabia as Otto II.

<doc id="308487" wikidata="Q550146" url="?curid=308487" title="Gerbrand van den Eeckhout">
<text>Gerbrand van den Eeckhout (19 August 1621 – 29 September 1674) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and a favourite student of Rembrandt. He was also an etcher, an amateur poet, a collector and an adviser on art.

==Biography==
Gerbrand was born in Amsterdam, the son of a jeweller, a Mennonite who fled after 1585 from Antwerp to the north. In 1631 his mother died. His father&#x27;s second wife was Cornelia Dedel, the daughter of a founder of the Delft chamber of the Dutch East India Company.

Arnold Houbraken records Van den Eeckhout was a pupil of Rembrandt. A fellow pupil to Ferdinand Bol, Nicolaes Maes and Govert Flinck, but regarded as inferior to them in skill and experience; he soon assumed Rembrandt&#x27;s manner with such success that his pictures were confused with those of his master.

Eeckhout does not merely copy the subjects; he also takes the shapes, the figures, the Jewish dress and the pictorial effects of his master. It is difficult to form an exact judgment of Eeckhout&#x27;s qualities at the outset of his career. His earliest pieces are probably those in which he more faithfully reproduced Rembrandt&#x27;s peculiarities. Exclusively his is a tinge of green in shadows marring the harmony of the work, a gaudiness of jarring tints, uniform surface and a touch more quick than subtle.

Eeckhout matriculated early in the Gild of Amsterdam. As he grew older Eeckhout succeeded best in portraits, for example that of Isaac Commelin (formerly identified as a portrait of the historian Olfert Dapper (1669)), in the Städel collection in Frankfurt. Eeckhout occasionally varied his style. He followed Gerard ter Borch in &quot;Gambling Soldiers&quot;, at Stafford House, and a &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Merrymaking&quot;, in the collection of the marquess of Bute. Amongst the best of Eeckhout&#x27;s works are &quot;Christ in the Temple&quot; (1662), at Munich, and the &quot;Haman and Mordecai&quot; of 1665, at Luton House.

Eeckhout, unmarried, was also appreciated as art connoisseur, and dealing with poets and scientists. At the end of his life he was living with his sister-in-law, a widow, on Herengracht, at a very prestigious part of the canal. He died in Amsterdam.

<text>Govert (or Govaert) Teuniszoon Flinck (25 January 16152 February 1660) was a Dutch painter of the Dutch Golden Age.

==Life==
Born at Kleve, capital of the Duchy of Cleves, which was occupied at the time by the United Provinces, he was apprenticed by his father to a silk mercer, but having secretly acquired a passion for etching and drawing, was sent to Leeuwarden, where he boarded in the house of Lambert Jacobszoon, a Mennonite, better known as an itinerant preacher than as a painter.

Here Flinck was joined by Jacob Backer, and the companionship of a youth determined like himself to be an artist only confirmed his passion for painting. Amongst the neighbours of Jacobszon at Leeuwarden were the sons and relations of Rombertus van Uylenburgh, whose daughter Saskia married Rembrandt in 1634. Other members of the same family lived at Amsterdam, cultivating the arts either professionally or as amateurs. The pupils of Lambert probably gained some knowledge of Rembrandt by intercourse with the Ulenburgs. Certainly Joachim von Sandrart, who visited Holland in 1637, found Flinck acknowledged as one of Rembrandt&#x27;s best pupils, and living habitually in the house of the dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh at Amsterdam.

For many years Flinck laboured on the lines of Rembrandt, following that master&#x27;s style in all the works which he executed between 1636 and 1648. It was after his time with Rembrandt that he took up the material of blue paper for drawings with his colleagues Jacob Backer and Jacob van Loo. With aspirations as a history painter, however, he looked to the swelling forms and grand action of Peter Paul Rubens, which led to many commissions for official and diplomatic painting. Flinck&#x27;s relations with Cleves became in time very important. He was introduced to the court of the Great Elector, Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg, who possessed the Duchy and who married in 1646 Louisa of Orange. He obtained the patronage of John Maurice of Nassau, who was made stadtholder of Cleves in 1649.

In 1652 a citizen of Amsterdam, Flinck married in 1656 an heiress, Sophie van der Houven, daughter of a director of the Dutch East India Company. Flinck was already well known in the patrician circles over which the brothers Cornelis and Andries de Graeff and the alderman Jan Six presided; he was on terms of intimacy with the poet Joost van den Vondel and the treasurer Johannes Uitenbogaard. In his house, adorned with casts after the Antique, costumes, and a noble collection of prints, he often received the stadtholder John Maurice, whose portrait is still preserved in the work of the learned Caspar Barlaeus. Flinck died in Amsterdam on 2 February 1660.

==Works==

The earliest of Flinck&#x27;s authentic pieces is a portrait of a lady, dated 1636, in the gallery of Brunswick. His first subject picture is the &quot;Blessing of Jacob&quot; (1638), in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. Both are thoroughly Rembrandtesque in effect as well as in vigour of touch and warmth of flesh tints. The four &quot;civic guards&quot; of 1642, and &quot;the twelve musketeers&quot; with their president in an arm-chair (1648); in the Stadhuis, Amsterdam, are fine specimens of composed portrait groups. But the best of Flinck&#x27;s productions in this style is the &quot;peace of Münster&quot; in the Rijksmuseum, a canvas with 19 life-size figures full of animation in the faces, &quot;radiant with Rembrandtesque colour,&quot; and admirably distributed. Flinck here painted his own likeness to the left in a doorway. The mannered period of Flinck is amply illustrated in the &quot;Marcus Curius Dentatus refuses the gifts of the Samnites&quot;, and &quot;Solomon receiving Wisdom&quot;, in the Palace on the Dam at Amsterdam. Here it is that Flinck shows most defects, being faulty in arrangement, gaudy in tint, flat and shallow in execution, that looks as if it had been smeared with violet powder and rouge.

The chronology of Flinck&#x27;s works, so far as they are seen in public galleries, comprises, in addition to the foregoing, the &quot;Grey Beard&quot; of 1639 at Dresden, &quot;A Young Archer&quot; from 1640 in the Wallace Collection, the &quot;Girl&quot; of 1641 at the Louvre, a portrait group of a male and female (1646) at Rotterdam, a lady (1651) at Berlin.

In November 1659 the burgomaster of Amsterdam contracted with Flinck for 12 canvases to represent four heroic figures of David and Samson and Manius Curius Dentatus and Horatius Cocles, and scenes from the Batavians and Romans. Flinck was unable to finish more than the sketches. After his death Rembrandt was asked to fill one of the commissions, and produced his last great history picture, the &quot;Conspriracy of Claudius Civilis&quot;, which the authorities rejected.

In the same year he received a flattering acknowledgment from the town council of Cleves and the completion of a picture of Solomon which was a counterpart of the composition at Amsterdam. This and other pictures and portraits, such as those of Friedrich Wilhelm and John Maurice, and the allegory of &quot;Louisa of Orange attended by Victory and Fame&quot; and other figures at the cradle of the first-born son of the elector, have disappeared. Of several pictures which were painted for the Great Elector, none are preserved except the &quot;Expulsion of Hagar&quot; in the Berlin museum.

<text>John Maurice of Nassau ( ; ; ; 17 June 1604 – 20 December 1679), called &quot;the Brazilian&quot; for his fruitful period as governor of Dutch Brazil, was Count and (from 1664) Prince of Nassau-Siegen. He served as &quot;Herrenmeister&quot; (equivalent to Grand Master) of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg) from 1652 until his death in 1679.

The former residence of John Maurice in The Hague, Netherlands, is now an art museum named Mauritshuis, which means &quot;Maurice House&quot; in Dutch.

==Early years in Europe==
He was born in Dillenburg, and his father was John VII of Nassau-Siegen. His grandfather John VI of Nassau was the younger brother of Dutch &quot;stadtholder&quot; William the Silent of Orange, making him a grandnephew of William the Silent.

He joined the Dutch army in 1621, at a very early age. He distinguished himself in the campaigns of his cousin, the &quot;stadtholder&quot; Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. In 1626, he became a captain. In 1629, he was involved in the capture of Den Bosch. In 1636, he conquered a fortress at Schenkenschans.

== Dutch governor in Brazil ==

He was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1636 by the Dutch West India Company on recommendation of Frederick Henry. He landed at Recife, the port of Pernambuco and the chief stronghold of the Dutch, in January 1637. Immediately after his arrival, he began a campaign against the Spanish-Portuguese forces, which he defeated in repeated encounters. Believing himself strong enough to hold his own, he dispatched part of his forces to attack the Portuguese possessions on the coast of Africa, and continued to extend his conquests with the aid of the natives who were opposed to Spanish rule, but he received a serious check in the attack on São Salvador, being obliged to raise the siege with the loss of many of his best officers. On receiving reinforcements in 1638, and with the co-operation of the Dutch fleet, which defeated the Spanish-Portuguese squadrons in sight of Bay of All Saints, he captured the latter city. When in 1640, Portugal recovered its independence from Spain under John II, 8th Duke of Bragança, the Prince of Nassau-Siegen, anticipating an alliance with the latter, and believing that a treaty of peace with Portugal would leave Holland in possession of the conquered territory, hastened his operations; to give occupation to the host of adventurers that had assembled under his colors, he dispatched an expedition against the Spanish possessions on Plate River, while in 1643, Johan Maurits equipped the expedition of Hendrik Brouwer that attempted to establish an outpost in southern Chile. Later, he visited the conquered provinces and arranged their administration.

===Life in the settlements===
By this series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from Sergipe in the south to São Luís de Maranhão in the north. With the assistance of the famous architect, Pieter Post of Haarlem, he transformed Recife by building a new town adorned with public buildings, bridges, channels, and gardens in the then Dutch style, later naming the newly reformed town Mauritsstad, after himself. He was able to pay the high construction costs from the loot of his expeditions, and from the proceeds of his estates in Germany.
By his statesmanlike policy, he brought the colony into a most flourishing condition. His leadership in Brazil inspired two Latin epics from 1647: Caspar Barlaeus&#x27; &quot;Rerum per octennium in Brasilia et alibi nuper gestarum sub praefectura&quot; and Franciscus Plante&#x27;s &quot;Mauritias&quot;. The painters Albert Eckhout, Frans Post, and Abraham Willaerts served as members of John Maurice&#x27;s entourage.

He also established representative councils in the colony for local government, and developed Recife&#x27;s transportation infrastructure. His large schemes and lavish expenditures alarmed the parsimonious directors of the West India Company, and John Maurice, refusing to retain his post unless he were given a free hand, returned to Europe in July 1644.
As governor-general of a Brazilian colony setup by the Dutch West India Company from 1636 until 1644, Johan Maurice was both personally involved in keeping Africans slaves, and personally profited from the trade and transport of Africans to Brazil. In 1643, Nassau received an embassy from the Manikongo to strengthen the economic relations between the Kingdom of the Kongo and Dutch Brazil through the sale of slaves.

== Return to Europe ==

Shortly after returning to Europe, John Maurice was appointed by Frederick Henry to the command of the cavalry in the Dutch army, and he took part in the campaigns of 1645 and 1646. When the war was ended by the Peace of Münster in January 1648, he accepted from Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg (who had just married John Maurice&#x27;s niece Louise) the post of governor of Cleves, Mark and Ravensberg, and later also of Minden. His success in the Rhineland was as great as it had been in Brazil, and he proved himself a most able and wise ruler. Also, he created large baroque gardens in and around Kleve, as well as a new residence, the Prinzenhof palace.

At the end of 1652, John Maurice was appointed head of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg) and made a prince of the Empire with the style of Serene Highness. In 1664, he came back to Holland; when war broke out with an England supported by the invading bishop of Münster, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Dutch States Army. Though hampered in his command by the restrictions of the states-general, he repelled the invasion, and the bishop, Christoph Bernhard von Galen, nicknamed &quot;Bommen Berend&quot;, was forced to conclude peace. His campaigning was not yet at an end, for in 1668, he was appointed first field-marshal of the States Army, and in 1673, he was charged by &quot;stadtholder&quot; William III to command the forces in Friesland and Groningen, and to defend the eastern frontier of the provinces, again against Van Galen. This he did with success and the troops of Von Galen were forced to withdraw. The next year John Maurice commanded troops against the French during the Battle of Seneffe.

In 1675, his health compelled him to give up active military service, and he spent his last years in his beloved Cleves, where he died in December 1679.

==Legacy==
The residence he built in The Hague is now called the Mauritshuis, and houses the Royal Cabinet of Paintings. It is now a major museum of old Dutch paintings. In the National Library of Paris are two folio volumes containing a fine collection of colored prints of Brazilian animals and plants, which were executed by order of the prince, and accompanied with a short explanation by him.

He is said to have had an affair with Anna Gonsalves Paes de Azevedo.

Brazilian author Paulo Setúbal wrote a historic novel about John Maurice and the Dutch settlement in Brazil, &quot;O Príncipe de Nassau&quot; (&quot;The Prince of Nassau&quot;, translated into Dutch by R. Schreuder and J. Slauerhoff in 1933 as &quot;Johan Maurits van Nassau&quot;).

Two ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy have been named after him.

<text>Richard Copley Christie (22 July 1830 – 9 January 1901) was an English lawyer, university teacher, philanthropist and bibliophile.

==Early life and education==
He was born at Lenton in Nottinghamshire, the son of a mill owner. He was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford where he was tutored by Mark Pattison, and was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1857. He also held numerous academic appointments, notably the professorships of history from 1854 to 1856 and of political economy from 1855 to 1866 at Owens College. 

==Career==
==Philanthropy==
Christie was a friend of the industrialist Sir Joseph Whitworth. By Whitworth&#x27;s will, Christie was appointed one of three legatees, each of whom was left more than half a million pounds for their own use, ‘they being each of them aware of the objects’ to which these funds would have been put by Whitworth. They chose to spend more than a fifth of the money on support for Owens College, together with the purchase of land now occupied by the Manchester Royal Infirmary. In 1897, Christie personally assigned more than £50,000 for the erection of the Whitworth Hall, to complete the front quadrangle of Owens College. 

He was president of the Whitworth Institute from 1890 to 1895 and was much interested in the medical and other charities of Manchester, especially the Cancer Pavilion and Home, of whose committee he was chairman from 1890 to 1893, and which later became the Christie Hospital. In October 1893 the freedom of the city of Manchester was conferred upon him and on his surviving fellow legatee, R. D. Darbishire.

===Chancellor of the diocese===
From 1872 to 1894, Christie was Chancellor of the Anglican Diocese of Manchester. In that capacity, he advised Bishop of Manchester James Fraser on the matters that led to the imprisonment of the Rev. Sidney Faithorn Green under the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874.

===Bibliophily===
Christie was an enthusiastic book collector, and bequeathed to Owens College his library of about 15,000 volumes, rich in a very complete set of the books printed by Étienne Dolet, a series of Aldine Press publications, and of volumes printed by Sebastian Gryphius and other European humanists. His &quot;Étienne Dolet, the Martyr of the Renaissance&quot; (1880) is the most exhaustive work on the subject. 

==Death==
Christie died at Ribsden in Surrey after a long period of illness: the book collection has always been separate from the general stock of the library of Manchester University and was transferred to the John Rylands Library building in Deansgate in 1972. A printed catalogue was issued in 1915 by the librarian, Charles Leigh. A stained glass window commemorates him on the staircase of the Christie Library.

==Scholarship==
He was the author of a number of essays and contributions to periodicals, some of which were published after his death. He was a Member of the Chetham Society, serving as a Member of Council from 1868, as vice-president in 1882–3, and as president from 1884 until 1901.
