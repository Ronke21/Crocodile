<text>In polymer chemistry, living polymerization is a form of chain growth polymerization where the ability of a growing polymer chain to terminate has been removed. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Chain termination and chain transfer reactions are absent and the rate of chain initiation is also much larger than the rate of chain propagation. The result is that the polymer chains grow at a more constant rate than seen in traditional chain polymerization and their lengths remain very similar (i.e. they have a very low polydispersity index). Living polymerization is a popular method for synthesizing block copolymers since the polymer can be synthesized in stages, each stage containing a different monomer. Additional advantages are predetermined molar mass and control over end-groups.

Living polymerization is desirable because it offers precision and control in macromolecular synthesis. This is important since many of the novel/useful properties of polymers result from their microstructure and molecular weight. Since molecular weight and dispersity are less controlled in non-living polymerizations, this method is more desirable for materials design

In many cases, living polymerization reactions are confused or thought to be synonymous with controlled polymerizations. While these polymerization reactions are very similar, there is a distinction between the definitions of these two reactions. While living polymerizations are defined as polymerization reactions where termination or chain transfer is eliminated, controlled polymerization reactions are reactions where termination is suppressed, but not eliminated, through the introduction of a dormant state of the polymer. However, this distinction is still up for debate in the literature.

The main living polymerization techniques are:
* Living anionic polymerization
* Living cationic polymerization
* Living ring-opening metathesis polymerization
* Living free radical polymerization
* Living chain-growth polycondensations

==History==
Living polymerization was demonstrated by Michael Szwarc in 1956 in the anionic polymerization of styrene with an alkali metal / naphthalene system in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Szwarc showed that electron transfer occurred from radical anion of naphthalene to styrene. The initial radical anion of styrene converts to a dianion (or equivalently disodio-) species, which rapidly added styrene to form a &quot;two – ended living polymer.&quot; An important aspect of his work, Szwarc employed the aprotic solvent tetrahydrofuran, which dissolves but is otherwise unreactive toward the organometallic intermediates. After initial addition of monomer to the initiator system, the viscosity increased (due to increased polymer chain growth), but eventually cease after depletion of monomer concentration. However, he found that addition of &quot;more&quot; monomer caused an increase in viscosity, indicating growth of the polymer chain, and thus concluded that the polymer chains had never been terminated. This was a major step in polymer chemistry, since control over when the polymer was quenched, or terminated, was generally not a controlled step. With this discovery, the list of potential applications expanded dramatically.

Today, living polymerizations are used widely in the production of many types of polymers or plastics. For instance, poly(phthalaldehyde) polymer, first developed in 1967, can be synthesized via both living cationic and living anionic polymerization reactions producing both the cyclic or linear form of the polymer respectively. The approach offers control of the chemical makeup of the polymer and, thus, the structural and electronic properties of the material. This level of control rarely exists in non-living polymerization reactions. 

==Fast rate of initiation: low polydispersity==
One of the key characteristics of a living polymerization is that the chain termination and transfer reactions are essentially eliminated from the four elementary reactions of chain-growth polymerization leaving only initiation and (chain) propagation reactions.

A key characteristic of living polymerization is that the rate of initiation (meaning the dormant chemical species generates the active chain propagating species) is much faster than the rate of chain propagation. Thus all of the chains grow at the same rate (the rate of propagation).

The high rate of initiation (together with absence of termination) results in low (or narrow) polydispersity index (PDI), an indication of the broadness in the distribution of polymer chains. The extended lifetime of the propagating chain allowing for co-block polymer formation and end group functionalization to be performed on the living chain. These factors also allow predictable molecular weights, expressed as the number average molecular weight (Mn). For an ideal living system, assuming efficiency for generating active species is 100%, where each initiator generates only one active species the Kinetic chain length (average number of monomers the active species reacts with during its lifetime) at a given time can be estimated by knowing the concentration of monomer remaining. The number average molecular weight, Mn, increases linearly with percent conversion during a living polymerization

===Living anionic polymerization===

As early as 1936, Karl Ziegler proposed that anionic polymerization of styrene and butadiene by consecutive addition of monomer to an alkyl lithium initiator occurred without chain transfer or termination. Twenty years later, living polymerization was demonstrated by Szwarc through the anionic polymerization of styrene in THF using sodium naphthalene as an initiator.

The naphthalene anion initiates polymerization by reducing styrene to its radical anion, which dimerizes to the dilithiodiphenylbutane, which then initiates the polymerization. These experiments relied on Szwarc&#x27;s ability to control the levels of impurities which would destroy the highly reactive organometallic intermediates.

====Living α-olefin polymerization====

α-olefins can be polymerized through an anionic coordination polymerization in which the metal center of the catalyst is considered the counter cation for the anionic end of the alkyl chain (through a M-R coordination). Ziegler-Natta initiators were developed in the mid-1950s and are heterogeneous initiators used in the polymerization of alpha-olefins. Not only were these initiators the first to achieve relatively high molecular weight poly(1-alkenes) (currently the most widely produced thermoplastic in the world PE(Polyethylene) and PP (Polypropylene) but the initiators were also capable of stereoselective polymerizations which is attributed to the chiral Crystal structure of the heterogeneous initiator. Due to the importance of this discovery Ziegler and Natta were presented with the 1963 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Although the active species formed from the Ziegler-Natta initiator generally have long lifetimes (on the scale of hours or longer) the lifetimes of the propagating chains are shortened due to several chain transfer pathways (Beta-Hydride elimination and transfer to the co-initiator) and as a result are not considered living.

Metallocene initiators are considered as a type of Ziegler-Natta initiators due to the use of the two-component system consisting of a transition metal and a group I-III metal co-initiator (for example methylalumoxane (MAO) or other alkyl aluminum compounds). The metallocene initiators form homogeneous single site catalysts that were initially developed to study the impact that the catalyst structure had on the resulting polymers structure/properties; which was difficult for multi-site heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta initiators. Owing to the discrete single site on the metallocene catalyst researchers were able to tune and relate how the ancillary ligand (those not directly involved in the chemical transformations) structure and the symmetry about the chiral metal center affect the microstructure of the polymer. However, due to chain breaking reactions (mainly Beta-Hydride elimination) very few metallocene based polymerizations are known.

By tuning the steric bulk and electronic properties of the ancillary ligands and their substituents a class of initiators known as chelate initiators (or post-metallocene initiators) have been successfully used for stereospecific living polymerizations of alpha-olefins. The chelate initiators have a high potential for living polymerizations because the ancillary ligands can be designed to discourage or inhibit chain termination pathways. Chelate initiators can be further broken down based on the ancillary ligands; ansa-cyclopentyadienyl-amido initiators, alpha-diimine chelates and phenoxy-imine chelates. 
*Ansa-cyclopentadienyl-amido (CpA) initiators 

CpA initiators have one cyclopentadienyl substituent and one or more nitrogen substituents coordinated to the metal center (generally a Zr or Ti) (Odian). The dimethyl(pentamethylcyclopentyl)zirconium acetamidinate in figure___ has been used for a stereospecific living polymerization of 1-hexene at −10 °C. The resulting poly(1-hexene) was isotactic (stereochemistry is the same between adjacent repeat units) confirmed by 13C-NMR. The multiple trials demonstrated a controllable and predictable (from catalyst to monomer ratio) Mn with low Đ. The polymerization was further confirmed to be living by sequentially adding 2 portions of the monomer, the second portion was added after the first portion was already polymerized, and monitoring the Đ and Mn of the chain. The resulting polymer chains complied with the predicted Mn (with the total monomer concentration = portion 1 +2) and showed low Đ suggesting the chains were still active, or living, as the second portion of monomer was added (5).
*α-diimine chelate initiators
α-diimine chelate initiators are characterized by having a diimine chelating ancillary ligand structure and which is generally coordinated to a late transition (i.e. Ni and Pd) metal center. 

Brookhart et al. did extensive work with this class of catalysts and reported living polymerization for α-olefins and demonstrated living α-olefin carbon monoxide alternating copolymers.

===Living cationic polymerization===

Monomers for living cationic polymerization are electron-rich alkenes such as vinyl ethers, isobutylene, styrene, and N-vinylcarbazole. The initiators are binary systems consisting of an electrophile and a Lewis acid. The method was developed around 1980 with contributions from Higashimura, Sawamoto and Kennedy. Typically, generating a stable carbocation for a prolonged period of time is difficult, due to the possibility for the cation to be quenched by a β-protons attached to another monomer in the backbone, or in a free monomer. Therefore, a different approach is taken

In this example, the carbocation is generated by the addition of a Lewis acid (co-initiator, along with the halogen &quot;X&quot; already on the polymer – see figure), which ultimately generates the carbocation in a weak equilibrium. This equilibrium heavily favors the dormant state, thus leaving little time for permanent quenching or termination by other pathways. In addition, a weak nucleophile (Nu:) can also be added to reduce the concentration of active species even further, thus keeping the polymer &quot;living&quot;. However, it is important to note that due to the introduction of a dormant state, as termination has only been decreased, not eliminated (though this topic is still up for debate). But, they do operate similarly, and are used in similar applications to those of true living polymerizations.

===Living ring-opening metathesis polymerization===
Given the right reaction conditions ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) can be rendered living. The first such systems were described by Robert H. Grubbs in 1986 based on norbornene and Tebbe&#x27;s reagent and in 1978 Grubbs together with Richard R. Schrock describing living polymerization with a tungsten carbene complex.

Generally, ROMP reactions involve the conversion of a cyclic olefin with significant ring-strain (&gt;5 kcal/mol), such as cyclobutene, norbornene, cyclopentene, etc., to a polymer that also contains double bonds. The important thing to note about ring-opening metathesis polymerizations is that the double bond is usually maintained in the backbone, which can allow it to be considered &quot;living&quot; under the right conditions.

For a ROMP reaction to be considered &quot;living&quot;, several guidelines must be met:
# Fast and complete initiation of the monomer. This means that the rate at which an initiating agent activates the monomer for polymerization, must happen very quickly.
# How many monomers make up each polymer (the degree of polymerization) must be related linearly to the amount of monomer you started with.
# The dispersity of the polymer must be &lt; 1.5. In other words, the distribution of how long your polymer chains are in your reaction must be very low.
With these guidelines in mind, it allows you to create a polymer that is well controlled both in content (what monomer you use) and properties of the polymer (which can be largely attributed to polymer chain length). It is important to note that living ring-opening polymerizations can be anionic &quot;or&quot; cationic.

Because living polymers have had their termination ability removed, this means that once your monomer has been consumed, the addition of more monomer will result in the polymer chains continuing to grow until all of the additional monomer is consumed. This will continue until the metal catalyst at the end of the chain is intentionally removed by the addition of a quenching agent. As a result, it may potentially allow one to create a block or gradient copolymer fairly easily and accurately. This can lead to a high ability to tune the properties of the polymer to a desired application (electrical/ionic conduction, etc.)

===&quot;Living&quot; free radical polymerization===
Starting in the 1970s several new methods were discovered which allowed the development of living polymerization using free radical chemistry. These techniques involved catalytic chain transfer polymerization, iniferter mediated polymerization, stable free radical mediated polymerization (SFRP), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, and iodine-transfer polymerization.

In &quot;living&quot; radical polymerization (or controlled radical polymerization (CRP)) the chain breaking pathways are severely depressed when compared to conventional radical polymerization (RP) and CRP can display characteristics of a living polymerization. However, since chain termination is not absent, but only minimized, CRP technically does not meet the requirements imposed by IUPAC for a living polymerization (see introduction for IUPAC definition). This issue has been up for debate the view points of different researchers can be found in a special issue of the Journal of Polymer Science titled Living or Controlled ?. The issue has not yet been resolved in the literature so it is often denoted as a &quot;living&quot; polymerization, quasi-living polymerization, pseudo-living and other terms to denote this issue.

There are two general strategies employed in CRP to suppress chain breaking reactions and promote fast initiation relative to propagation. Both strategies are based on developing a dynamic equilibrium amongst an active propagating radical and a dormant species.

The first strategy involves a reversible trapping mechanism in which the propagating radical undergoes an activation/deactivation (i.e. Atom-transfer radical-polymerization) process with a species X. The species X is a persistent radical, or a species that can generate a stable radical, that cannot terminate with itself or propagate but can only reversibly &quot;terminate&quot; with the propagating radical (from the propagating polymer chain) P*. P* is a radical species that can propagate (kp) and irreversibly terminate (kt) with another P*. X is normally a nitroxide (i.e. TEMPO used in Nitroxide Mediated Radical Polymerization) or an organometallic species. The dormant species (Pn-X) can be activated to regenerate the active propagating species (P*) spontaneously, thermally, using a catalyst and optically. 
The second strategy is based on a degenerative transfer (DT) of the propagating radical between transfer agent that acts as a dormant species (i.e. Reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization). The DT based CRP&#x27;s follow the conventional kinetics of radical polymerization, that is slow initiation and fast termination, but the transfer agent (Pm-X or Pn-X) is present in a much higher concentration compared to the radical initiator. The propagating radical species undergoes a thermally neutral exchange with the dormant transfer agent through atom transfer, group transfer or addition fragment chemistry. 
===Living chain-growth polycondensations===

Chain growth polycondensation polymerizations were initially developed under the premise that a change in substituent effects of the polymer, relative to the monomer, causes the polymers end group to be more reactive this has been referred to as &quot;reactive intermediate polycondensation&quot;. The essential result is monomers preferentially react with the activated polymer end groups over reactions with other monomers. This preferred reactivity is the fundamental difference when categorizing a polymerization mechanism as chain-growth as opposed to step-growth in which the monomer and polymer chain end group have equal reactivity (the reactivity is uncontrolled). Several strategies were employed to minimize monomer-monomer reactions (or self-condensation) and polymerizations with low D and controllable Mn have been attained by this mechanism for small molecular weight polymers. However, for high molecular weight polymer chains (i.e. small initiator to monomer ratio) the Mn is not easily to controlled, for some monomers, since self-condensation between monomers occurred more frequently due to the low propagating species concentration.

====Catalyst-transfer polycondensation====

Catalyst transfer polycondensation (CTP) is a chain-growth polycondensation mechanism in which the monomers do not directly react with one another and instead the monomer will only react with the polymer end group through a catalyst-mediated mechanism. The general process consists of the catalyst activating the polymer end group followed by a reaction of the end group with a 2nd incoming monomer. The catalyst is then transferred to the elongated chain while activating the end group (as shown below).
Catalyst transfer polycondensation allows for the living polymerization of π-conjugated polymers and was discovered by Tsutomu Yokozawa in 2004 and Richard McCullough. In CTP the propagation step is based on organic cross coupling reactions (i.e. Kumada coupling, Sonogashira coupling, Negishi coupling) top form carbon carbon bonds between difunctional monomers. When Yokozawa and McCullough independently discovered the polymerization using a metal catalyst to couple a Grignard reagent with an organohalide making a new carbon-carbon bond. The mechanism below shows the formation of poly(3-alkylthiophene) using a Ni initiator (Ln can be 1,3-Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp)) and is similar to the conventional mechanism for Kumada coupling involving an oxidative addition, a transmetalation and a reductive elimination step. However, there is a key difference, following reductive elimination in CTP, an associative complex is formed (which has been supported by intra-/intermolecular oxidative addition competition experiments) and the subsequent oxidative addition occurs between the metal center and the associated chain (an intramolecular pathway). Whereas in a coupling reaction the newly formed alkyl/aryl compound diffuses away and the subsequent oxidative addition occurs between an incoming Ar–Br bond and the metal center. 
The associative complex is essential to for polymerization to occur in a living fashion since it allows the metal to undergo a preferred intramolecular oxidative addition and remain with a single propagating chain (consistent with chain-growth mechanism), as opposed to an intermolecular oxidative addition with other monomers present in the solution (consistent with a step-growth, non-living, mechanism). The monomer scope of CTP has been increasing since its discovery and has included poly(phenylene)s, poly(fluorine)s, poly(selenophene)s and poly(pyrrole)s. 
===Living group-transfer polymerization===
Group-transfer polymerization also has characteristics of living polymerization. It is applied to alkylated methacrylate monomers and the initiator is a silyl ketene acetal. New monomer adds to the initiator and to the active growing chain in a Michael reaction. With each addition of a monomer group the trimethylsilyl group is transferred to the end of the chain. The active chain-end is not ionic as in anionic or cationic polymerization but is covalent. The reaction can be catalysed by bifluorides and bioxyanions such as &quot;tris(dialkylamino)sulfonium bifluoride&quot; or &quot;tetrabutyl ammonium bibenzoate&quot;. The method was discovered in 1983 by Owen Webster and the name first suggested by Barry Trost.

==Applications==
Living polymerizations are used in the commercial synthesis of many polymers.

===Copolymer synthesis and applications===

Copolymers are polymers consisting of multiple different monomer species, and can be arranged in various orders, three of which are seen in the figure below.

While there exist others (alternating copolymers, graft copolymers, and stereoblock copolymers), these three are more common in the scientific literature. In addition, block copolymers can exist as many types, including triblock (A-B-A), alternating block (A-B-A-B-A-B), etc.

Of these three types, block and gradient copolymers are commonly synthesized through living polymerizations, due to the ease of control living polymerization provides. Copolymers are highly desired due to the increased flexibility of properties a polymer can have compared to their homopolymer counterparts. The synthetic techniques used range from ROMP to generic anionic or cationic living polymerizations.

Copolymers, due to their unique tunability of properties, can have a wide range of applications. One example (of many) is nano-scale lithography using block copolymers. One used frequently is a block copolymer made of polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) (abbreviated PS-&quot;b&quot;-PMMA). This copolymer, upon proper thermal and processing conditions, can form cylinders on the order of a few tens of nanometers in diameter of PMMA, surrounded by a PS matrix. These cylinders can then be etched away under high exposure to UV light and acetic acid, leaving a porous PS matrix.

The unique property of this material is that the size of the pores (or the size of the PMMA cylinders) can be easily tuned by the ratio of PS to PMMA in the synthesis of the copolymer. This can be easily tuned due to the easy control given by living polymerization reactions, thus making this technique highly desired for various nanoscale patterning of different materials for applications to catalysis, electronics, etc.

<text>Tonnage is a measure of the capacity of a ship, and is commonly used to assess fees on commercial shipping. The term derives from the taxation paid on &quot;tuns&quot; or casks of wine. In modern maritime usage, &quot;tonnage&quot; specifically refers to a calculation of the volume or cargo volume of a ship. Although tonnage (volume) should not be confused with displacement (the actual mass of the vessel), the long ton (or imperial ton) of 2,240 lb is derived from the fact that a &quot;tun&quot; of wine typically weighed that much.

== Current maritime units ==
Tonnage measurements are governed by an IMO Convention (International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (London-Rules)), which initially applied to all ships built after July 1982, and to older ships from July 1994. A commonly defined measurement system is important, since a ship&#x27;s registration fee, harbour dues, safety and manning rules, and the like may be based on its gross tonnage (GT) or net tonnage (NT).

===Gross tonnage===

Gross tonnage (GT) is a function of the volume of all of a ship&#x27;s enclosed spaces (from keel to funnel) measured to the outside of the hull framing. The numerical value for a ship&#x27;s GT is always smaller than the numerical values of &quot;gross register tonnage (GRT).&quot; Gross tonnage is therefore a kind of capacity-derived index that is used to rank a ship for purposes of determining manning, safety, and other statutory requirements and is expressed simply as GT, which is a unitless entity, even though it derives from the volumetric capacity in cubic metres.

===Net tonnage===

Net tonnage (NT) is based on a calculation of the volume of all cargo spaces of the ship. It indicates a vessel&#x27;s earning space and is a function of the moulded volume of all cargo spaces of the ship.

===Panama Canal/UMS===

The Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) is based on net tonnage modified for Panama Canal purposes. PC/UMS is based on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessel&#x27;s total volume; one PC/UMS net ton is equivalent to of capacity.

===Suez Canal Net Tonnage===

The Suez Canal Net Tonnage (SCNT) is derived with a number of modifications from the former net register tonnage of the Moorsom System and was established by the International Commission of Constantinople in its Protocol of 18 December 1873. It is still in use, as amended by the &quot;Rules of Navigation&quot; of the Suez Canal Authority and is registered in the Suez Canal Tonnage Certificate.

===Thames measurement tonnage===

Thames measurement tonnage (TM) is another volumetric system, generally used for small vessels such as yachts; it uses a formula based on the vessel&#x27;s length and beam.

== Historical maritime units ==
===Traditional casks===

Historically in England, tunnage was the medieval import duty on tuns of wine. A tun was a large size of casks used for wine), used in the wine trade. The number of tuns that a ship could carry was used as a measure of the size of the ship. 

The wine trade to England originated in France, which is where the tuns were made. A French standard tun cask size was established about 1450. The 15th century Bordeaux wine tun was between . When measuring the tonnage of a ship, the approximately cylindrical cask would have air space around it when stowed in a ship. Therefore the volume of hold space required for several tuns was greater than the total of the capacity of those tuns. 252 imperial gallons is just over . British practice by the 19th century was for a ton of cargo volume to be . This is derived from an estimate of the hull space needed to fit the roughly cylindrical tun and is broadly consistent with the much earlier French definition given below.

The Bordeaux tun was used as a measurement elsewhere in Europe. By the 16th century, multi-decked ships which were loaded through hatchways (as opposed to earlier undecked or single decked ships) found it more convenient to use a smaller size of standard barrel. This was the , measuring a quarter of the size of the tun (in English, this barrel was termed a hogshead). For instance, Basque ships engaged in 16th century whaling in Labrador used this size of barrel (with the name ). The French was legally defined, in 1681, as the cubic space into which four fitted, with the casks aligned two directly above the two below (so not optimising the layout). This redefined ton worked out as 42 cubic (. The difference between this measure and, for instance, the Spanish was calculated by recognised adjustment factors.

===Purpose of measuring tonnage===
Tonnage measurement was important for an increasing number of reasons through history. In England in the Middle Ages, ships were often impressed by the crown for military use. To do this in an efficient and speedy manner, a measurement of size was needed. The payment to the owner of the requisitioned ship was based on the tonnage. Port dues and various licences were based on tonnage, and it was a useful measure for a ship builder who needed to build a vessel that met the new owner&#x27;s requirements. 

In the Tudor period a bounty per ton was paid for the construction of larger ships, so the threshold for that payment had to be determined, as well as the amount paid for those qualifying.

===Method of measuring===
In the middle ages, the normal way of discovering the tonnage of a ship was to load her with wine and see how many tuns could be fitted in. There is an instance of the owner of a new ship, in 1459, being challenged that his safe-conduct was for a 400 ton vessel, whilst he had already loaded more than 600 tons. The excuse was accepted that he had no idea of her tonnage until she was loaded. In another case, in 1456, a dispute over the actual tonnage of a ship had to be resolved by having coopers part load her with (presumably empty) barrels to estimate what she could carry.

The Tudor bounty paid for the construction of larger ship was apparently paid without any measurement system to confirm the actual size. The presumption is that it was taken from the amount of cargo unloaded after the first voyage (which would be recorded in the customs records of the relevant port).

===Gross register tonnage===

Gross register tonnage (GRT) represents the total internal volume of a vessel, where one register ton is equal to a volume of ; a volume that, if filled with fresh water, would weigh around 2.83 tonnes. The definition and calculation of the internal volume is complex; for instance, a ship&#x27;s hold may be assessed for bulk grain (accounting for all the air space in the hold) or for bales (omitting the spaces into which bulk, but not baled cargo, would spill). Gross register tonnage was replaced by &quot;gross tonnage&quot; in 1982 under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969, with all ships measured in GRT either scrapped or re-measured in GT by 1994.

===Net register tonnage===

Net register tonnage (NRT) is the volume of cargo the vessel can carry—that is, the gross register tonnage less the volume of spaces that do not hold cargo (e.g., engine compartment, helm station, and crew spaces, again with differences depending on which port or country does the calculations). It represents the volume of the ship available for transporting freight or passengers. It was replaced by &quot;net tonnage&quot; in 1994, under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969.

<doc id="308687" wikidata="Q7527183" url="?curid=308687" title="Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet (7 February 1713 – 11 September 1769) was a British colonial administrator who served as the governor of New York from 1765 to 1769, when he died in office. Moore also served as the lieutenant governor of Jamaica in 1756 and again from 1759 to 1762. He was granted a baronetcy in 1764.

==Early life==

Henry Moore was born on 7 February 1713 in Vere Parish, Jamaica. His parents were prominent members of the planter class who arranged for him to undergo a legal education. After coming of age, Moore became active in managing the affairs of the colonial government.

==Governor of Jamaica==

In 1756, Moore was appointed as the lieutenant governor of Jamaica, which made him the acting governor of the colony. Like many Crown colonies, the governor was frequently absent, collecting his fees and salary while remaining in the British Isles; a local lieutenant governor and council forming the &quot;de facto&quot; government. 

In 1760, Moore gained a considerable reputation for leadership by suppressing Tacky&#x27;s War, a slave rebellion. Under Moore&#x27;s leadership, the Jamaican Maroons of Nanny Town, Charles Town, Jamaica and Scott&#x27;s Hall were summoned to help the colonial forces suppress the revolt. Nanny Town was reportedly renamed Moore Town in his honour.

==Governor of New York==

Moore&#x27;s reward for good performance as Jamaica&#x27;s governor was first to be made a Baronet, and then in 1764 he was named royal governor for New York. 

He arrived in New York City with his family in November 1765. Relations between the colonies and England were strained under the governorship of Cadwallader Colden by this time, but not yet in open rebellion. New York City had seen riots and protests over the Stamp Act, esp around Fort George. 

As new governor, Moore calmed these by meeting directly with Isaac Sears, a leader of the Sons of Liberty. Moore agreed with Sears and the colony&#x27;s assembly to suppress the Stamp Act, and gained additional goodwill by reducing military fortifications within the city. His openness and courtesy earned him floral tributes while other colonial governors were being burned in effigy.

However, during the next few years, he actively used military force to suppress rural riots by tenants of the large estate owners. He ordered General Thomas Gage to actively pursue and suppress this form of rebellion. This did not seem to bring him any increased difficulty in governing, for two reasons: that the Sons of Liberty also feared the introduction of rural problems into the city, believing that they should be the only ones to use riots as a bargaining tactic; and that the assembly at the time was dominated by the patroons, or large estate owners. In December 1767 Moore dissolved the assembly to allow the patroons to make up through new elections some of the numbers they had lost earlier.

== Death ==

Moore married Catherine Maria Long, a member of another prominent Jamaica family, in 1765. They had several children, and after Henry&#x27;s death, Catherine moved to England. Catherine&#x27;s Peak &quot;(altitude 1158 metres)&quot; in Jamaica is named after her, as local legend reports her to be the first woman to climb the peak. 

Moore died suddenly while in office in New York City in 1769. The duties of governor then fell on Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden, whose term was much less peaceful. Moore left with the respect of almost all the colony&#x27;s leadership, the only exception being certain religious fundamentalists angered by his efforts to create a theatre or playhouse. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his thirteen-year-old son John Henry Moore, 2nd Baronet, who died in 1780 aged 23.

<doc id="308695" wikidata="Q601900" url="?curid=308695" title="Jean Hill">
<text>Norma Jean Lollis Hill (February 11, 1931 – November 7, 2000) was an American woman who was an eyewitness to the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Hill was known as the &quot;Lady in Red&quot; because of the long red raincoat she wore that day, as seen in Abraham Zapruder&#x27;s film of the assassination. A teacher by profession, she was a consultant for Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;JFK&quot; and co-wrote &quot;JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness&quot; with Bill Sloan.

Hill&#x27;s claims have been both disputed and embraced. While official sources have considered her an unreliable witness for a number of reasons, other researchers investigating the assassination and the conclusions of the Warren Commission consider her a highly credible witness. They point to significant circumstantial evidence of an apparent smear campaign to undermine the testimony and credibility of Hill, the closest civilian witness to the assassination and its immediate aftermath.

Hill was a consistent critic of the official report of the Warren Commission since its release and in 1992 she co-wrote a book entitled &quot;The Last Dissenting Witness&quot;. In this book she made the assertion that her reported testimony before the Warren Commission was fabricated by the commission, a claim also made by others about Warren Commission testimony. Others observes that those claims cannot be verified one way or the other, and argue that the Warren Commission did not fabricate any testimony, although some people who probably committed perjury point to the possibility of an internal conspiracy.

==Background and early life==

Hill was born and raised in Ferguson, Oklahoma. After her parents divorced in 1943, she moved with her father to Wewoka, Oklahoma where she later graduated from Wewoka High School. Upon graduation, Hill enrolled at Oklahoma Baptist University. She dropped out after two years after marrying Bill Hill. The couple had two children, Jeanne and Billy. Hill eventually returned to college and earned a degree in elementary education in 1955. Hill worked as a teacher in Oklahoma City until 1962 when the family moved to Dallas for Bill Hill&#x27;s job at Science Research Associates.

Shortly after moving to Dallas, Hill and her husband separated. To support herself and her children, Hill got a job as a teacher with the Dallas public school system. Jean and Bill Hill&#x27;s divorce was finalized in August 1964.

==Eyewitness to the assassination of John F. Kennedy==
Hill was present along with her friend Mary Moorman across from the grassy knoll, and was one of the very nearest witnesses to the presidential limousine when shots were fired at President Kennedy. Moorman can be seen in the Zapruder film taking pictures, which Hill stated were later taken and bleached out by unknown parties. At Zapruder frame 313, when Kennedy was shot in the head, Hill was only 21 feet (6.4 m) away, leftward, and slightly behind him. In her Warren Commission testimony, she stated that a Secret Service agent told her right after the attack that another Secret Service agent, watching from the courthouse, saw a bullet strike &quot;at my feet&quot; and kick up debris. Hill was also one of several witnesses who stated that at the end of the assassination they saw smoke lingering near the grassy knoll picket fence corner.

Hill told the Warren Commission that she thought the shots were coming from the direction of the grassy knoll.

She further said that after the assassination she watched a man running from near the Texas School Book Depository toward the picket fence area. After watching this man, Hill crossed the street and was one of many witnesses and authorities who first ran toward the grassy knoll after the shots ended.

Mrs. Jean L. Hill stated that after the firing stopped she saw a white man wearing a brown overcoat and a hat running west away from the Depository Building in the direction of the railroad tracks. She has since stated when she saw a photo of Jack Ruby after his killing of Lee Harvey Oswald she now believes he was the man she saw running. You can see in the Zapruder film that she was clearly looking into the direction of the Texas School Book Depository while the president is right in front of her which appears to support her story of looking at someone running just after the assassination. There are no other witnesses who claim to have seen a man running toward the railroad tracks. Examination of all the available films of the area following the shooting, reexamination of the interviews with individuals in the vicinity of the shooting, and the interviews with members of the Dallas police department and the Dallas Country sheriff&#x27;s office failed to corroborate Mrs. Hill&#x27;s recollection or to reveal the identity of the man described by Mrs. Hill.

Hill stated that she received death threats and that the brake lines of her automobile were cut after the assassination. She viewed herself as a survivor who had escaped the &quot;mysterious deaths&quot; purported to have befallen other witnesses to the assassination.

In her 2004 book &quot;Conspiracy Narratives in Roman History&quot;, Victoria Emma Pagán, a professor of classics at the University of Florida, compared Hill to Hispala Faecenia stating that each had knowledge of a vast conspiracy, were threatened with physical harm if they did not support the official versions, and were deemed unreliable by authorities &quot;by virtue of their low social status&quot;. Pagán wrote that Hill kept silent for 15 years due to &quot;&#x27;accidents&#x27; that befell other witnesses&quot; and eventually defied the official report due to &quot;strong patriotic convictions&quot;. Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, said changes in Hill&#x27;s story over time led some researchers of the Kennedy assassination to consider Hill a &quot;controversial witness&quot;.

==Later life==
Hill was reported to have avoided publicity for nearly 25 years after testifying to the Warren Commission. She continued working for the Dallas Public School System until her retirement a few years before her death.

She worked as a consultant for Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;JFK&quot;, and was portrayed in the movie by Ellen McElduff. In 1992, Hill and Dallas journalist Bill Sloan released &quot;JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness&quot;. Stone wrote the foreword for the book. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said &quot;The Last Dissenting Witness&quot; &quot;was often engaging, sometimes infuriating&quot; and that Hill&#x27;s &quot;story is salutary for those overly respectful of official authority.&quot; Hill spoke to various groups about her experience of the Kennedy assassination and its controversial aftermath during the last few years of her life.

==Death==
On November 7, 2000, she died of complications due to a blood disease in Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, the same hospital to which Kennedy was rushed after being fatally shot. Parkland Memorial Hospital is also where Kennedy&#x27;s accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and Oswald&#x27;s killer Jack Ruby died. Hill is buried in Grove Hill Memorial Park in Dallas.

<doc id="308698" wikidata="Q388101" url="?curid=308698" title="Anglo-Celtic Australians">
<text>Anglo-Celtic Australians is an ancestral grouping of Australians whose ancestors originate wholly or partially in the British Isles - predominantly in England (including Cornish), Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as the Isle of Man and Channel Islands.

While Anglo-Celtic Australians do not form an official ethnic grouping in the Australian Bureau of Statistics&#x27; Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups, due to the long historical dominance and intermixture of Australians with ancestries from the British Isles, it is commonly used as an informal ethnic identifier.

The term has received criticism for erasing historical distinctions between English and Celtic settlers. In particular, it does not account for the political and social segregation of English and Irish Australians which some scholars have labelled an apartheid or the fact that while many English arrived in Australia as willing immigrants, many Irish were forcibly transported as prisoners or refugees.

At the 2021 census, the number of ancestry responses from the following groups as a proportion of the total Australian population amounted to 51.7%: English Australian, Irish Australian, Scottish Australian, Welsh Australian, Cornish Australians, British Australian (so described), Manx Australian, Channel Islander Australian. The precise number of Anglo-Celtic Australians is unknown due to the way in which ancestry data is collected in Australia. For instance, many census recipients nominated two Anglo-Celtic ancestries due to the long history of these ancestries in Australia, tending towards an overcount. Conversely, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most people nominating &quot;Australian&quot; ancestry have at least partial Anglo-Celtic European ancestry despite &quot;Australian&quot; ancestry being classified as part of the Oceanian ancestry group, tending towards an undercount.

== History ==

=== Pre-Federation ===
The British Government initiated European settlement of the Australian continent by establishing a penal settlement at Sydney Cove in 1788. Between then and 1852, about 100,000 convicts (mostly tried in England) were transported to eastern Australia. Scotland and Wales contributed relatively few convicts.

Native-born Australians of British and Irish descent were approximately a quarter of the population of the colony of New South Wales in both 1817 and 1828. There were slightly more native-born than free settlers in 1850. They were nearly half of the population in 1868. Their proportion of the population decreased during the times of the rapid population growth brought on by the goldrushes. The convicts were augmented by free settlers, including large numbers who arrived during the gold-rush in the 1850s. As late as 1861, people born in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland outnumbered even the Australia-born population. The number of settlers in Australia who were born in the United Kingdom (UK) peaked at 825,000 in 1891, from which point the proportion of British among all immigrants to Australia steadily declined.

Until 1859, 2.2 million (73%) of the free settlers who immigrated were British.
=== Post-Federation ===
From the beginning of the colonial era until the mid-20th century, the vast majority of settlers to Australia were from Britain and Ireland, with the English being the dominant group, followed by the Irish and Scottish. Among the leading ancestries, increases in Australian, Irish, and German ancestries and decreases in English, Scottish, and Welsh ancestries appear to reflect such shifts in perception or reporting. These reporting shifts at least partly resulted from changes in the design of the census question, in particular the introduction of a tick box format in 2001.

Those born in the United Kingdom were the largest foreign group throughout the 20th century. Prior to the last quarter of the century, the United Kingdom was strongly favoured as a source country by immigrant selection policies and remained the largest single component of the annual immigration intake until 1995–96, when immigrants from New Zealand surpassed it in number.
However, their share of the total immigrant population is in decline. Those from the United Kingdom comprised 58 per cent of the total overseas-born population in 1901, compared to 27 per cent in 1996. An even greater decline has occurred for those born in Ireland. In 1901, those born in Ireland comprised 22 per cent of all immigrants, while in 1996 the Ireland-born
represented just 1 per cent of the immigrant population.

While those born in England have formed the largest component of the British immigrant population, Australia has also received significant numbers of immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Up until the First World War the Irish were, in their own right, the second largest immigrant population.

The most dramatic increase in the British immigrant population occurred between 1961 and 1971. The number of British-born people living in Australia exceeded one million at the 1971 Census and has remained above one million to this day. The United Kingdom-born population in Australia reached a peak of 1,107,119 in 1991.

==Demographics==

Anglo-Celtic is not an official ancestry category in the Australian census. Census respondents may nominate up to two ancestries. The number of ancestry responses from the following groups as a proportion of the total Australian population amounted to 51.7% at the 2021 census: English Australian, Irish Australian, Scottish Australian, Cornish Australians, Welsh Australian, British Australian (so described), Manx Australian, Channel Islander Australian. The precise number of Anglo-Celtic Australians is unknown due to the way in which ancestry data is collected in Australia. For instance, many census recipients nominated two Anglo-Celtic ancestries due to the long history of these ancestries in Australia, tending towards an overcount. Conversely, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most people nominating &quot;Australian&quot; ancestry have at least partial Anglo-Celtic European ancestry despite &quot;Australian&quot; ancestry being classified as part of the Oceanian ancestry group, tending towards an undercount.

At the 2021 census, the most commonly nominated Anglo-Celtic ancestries were:
The United Kingdom remains a significant source of immigrants to Australia. In 2005–06, 22,143 persons born in the United Kingdom settled in Australia, representing 21.4% of all migrants. At the 2006 Census (excluding overseas visitors) 1,038,165 persons identified themselves as having been born in the United Kingdom (5.2% of the Australian population), while 50,251 identified themselves as Irish born.

Melbourne and Sydney have the lowest rates of Anglo-Celtic Australians, particularly in certain regions of each city (such as Western Sydney). Tasmania could have the nation&#x27;s highest proportion of citizens of Anglo-Celtic origin, possibly as high as 85 percent. On the evidence of statistics of ethnic derivation Tasmania could also be considered more British than New Zealand (where the Anglo-Celtic majority has fallen below 75 percent).

==Historical demographics==
===British and Irish population per census===
The following table shows the British and Irish-born population for every national Australian census as a proportion of the total foreign-born population at various points.
Notes: From 1954 onwards people from &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; and &quot;Ulster&quot; were recorded separately from the people of &quot;Ireland&quot;. The 1966 census (is Republic of Ireland &amp; Ireland (undefined).

==Self-identified census data==
The following table shows various Anglo-Celtic ancestries since 1986, the first census to include as a question on ancestry. The aim of the question was to measure the ethnic composition of the population as a whole. Very little use was made of the ancestry data from the 1986 Census. As a consequence, ancestry was not included in either the 1991 or 1996 Censuses. Between 1987 and 1999, the Anglo-Celtic component of Australia&#x27;s population declined from 75 per cent to 70 per cent. In 1999, the Anglo-Celtic share of the Australian population was calculated as 69.9%.

===Maps===
==Controversy and criticism==
Some have argued that the term is entirely a product of multiculturalism that ignores the history of sectarianism in Australia. For example, historian John Hirst wrote in 1994: &quot;Mainstream Australian society was reduced to an ethnic group and given an ethnic name: Anglo-Celt.&quot;

According to Hirst:

In the eyes of multiculturalists, Australian society of the 1940s, 150 years after first settlement, is adequately described as Anglo-Celtic. At least this acknowledges that the people of Australia were Irish and Scots as well as English, but it has nothing more substantial than a hyphen joining them. In fact a distinct new culture had been formed. English, Scots and Irish had formed a common identity – first of all British and then gradually Australian as well. In the 1930s the historian W. K. Hancock could aptly describe them as Independent Australian Britons.

The Irish-Australian journalist Siobhán McHugh has argued that the term &quot;Anglo-Celtic&quot; is &quot;an insidious distortion of our past and a galling denial of the struggle by an earlier minority group&quot;, Irish Australians, &quot;against oppression and demonisation... In what we now cosily term &quot;Anglo-Celtic&quot; Australia, a virtual social apartheid existed at times between [Irish] Catholics and [British] Protestants&quot;, which did not end until the 1960s.

The term was also criticised by the historian Patrick O&#x27;Farrell as &quot;a grossly misleading, false, and patronising convenience, one crassly present-oriented. Its use removes from consciousness and recognition a major conflict fundamental to any comprehension not only of Australian history but of our present core culture.&quot;

==Culture==

Streams of migration from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland to Australia played a key role in Australia&#x27;s cultural development, despite the last substantial scheme for preferential migration from Britain to Australia ending in 1972.
There is a long history of cultural exchange between the countries and many Australians have used Britain as a stepping-stone to international success, e.g., Nellie Melba, Peter Dawson, Clive James, Robert Hughes.
In 1967, British migrants in Australia formed an association to represent their special interests: the United Kingdom Settlers&#x27; Association, which subsequently became the British Australian Community.

On 10 July 2017, at a press conference in London, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said:
==Place names of British origin==

There are many places in Australia named after people and places in the United Kingdom as a result of the many British settlers and explorers; in addition, some places were named after the British royal family.

===New South Wales===
New South Wales – Cook first named the land &quot;New Wales&quot;, named after Wales. However, in the copy held by the Admiralty, he &quot;revised the wording&quot; to &quot;New South Wales&quot;.

* Hyde Park – was named after the original Hyde Park in London, England and is the oldest public parkland in Australia
* Newcastle, New South Wales – is named after Newcastle, England
* The state capital city of Sydney is named in honour of English politician Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney.

===Northern Territory===
* The state capital city of Darwin. A Scottish naval officer named the region &quot;Port Darwin&quot; in honour of English naturalist Charles Darwin.

===Queensland===
Queensland – The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales.
*Brisbane – is named after Scotsman Thomas Brisbane.

===South Australia===
* The state capital city of Adelaide founded in 1836, is named in honour of Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, queen consort to King William IV.

===Tasmania===

*Launceston – was named in honour of the New South Wales Governor Captain Philip Gidley King, who was born in Launceston, Cornwall, England.

===Victoria===
Victoria – like Queensland, was named after Queen Victoria, who had been on the British throne for 14 years when the colony was established in 1851.

* Melbourne – was named in honour of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, Queen Victoria&#x27;s first Prime Minister, and thus indirectly takes its name from the village of Melbourne, Derbyshire, England.

===Western Australia===
* Perth – The city is named after Perth, Scotland, by influence of Sir George Murray, then British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. in Murray&#x27;s honour.

===External territories===

<text>Volker Schlöndorff (; born 31 March 1939) is a German film director, screenwriter and producer who has worked in Germany, France and the United States. He was a prominent member of the New German Cinema of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

He has won an Oscar as well as the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (1979), the film version of the novel by Nobel Prize-winning author Günter Grass.

== Early life ==

Volker Schlöndorff was born in Wiesbaden, then part of Nazi Germany, to the physician Georg Schlöndorff. His mother was killed in a kitchen fire in 1944. His family moved to Paris in 1956, where Schlöndorff won awards at school for his work in philosophy. He graduated in political science at the Sorbonne, while at the same time studying film at the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques, where he was friends with Bertrand Tavernier and met Louis Malle. Malle gave him his first job as his assistant director on &quot;Zazie in the Metro&quot; (1960), which continued with the films &quot;A Very Private Affair&quot; (1962), &quot;The Fire Within&quot; (1963), and &quot;Viva Maria!&quot; (1965). Schlöndorff also worked as assistant director on Alain Resnais&#x27;s &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; and Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s &quot;Léon Morin, Priest&quot; (both 1961). During this time he also made his first short film, &quot;Who Cares?&quot;, about French people living in Frankfurt in 1960. He collaborated with filmmaker Jean-Daniel Pollet on the 40-minute documentary &quot;Méditerranée&quot;, released in 1963. The film is highly regarded, gaining praise from Jean-Luc Godard and consistently appearing in the popular book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

== Early film career ==

Schlöndorff returned to Germany to make his feature film debut, &quot;Young Törless&quot; (&quot;Der junge Törless&quot;, 1966). Produced by Malle and based on Robert Musil&#x27;s novel &quot;The Confusions of Young Törless&quot;, it debuted at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. Taking place at a semi-military Austrian boarding school, Törless witnesses the bullying of a fellow student but does nothing to prevent it despite his superior and mature intellect. He gradually begins to accept his personal responsibility for the abuse through his inaction and runs away from the school. The analogy to prewar Germany is obvious and the film was highly praised upon release, winning the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes.

The New German Cinema movement unofficially began in 1962 with the Oberhausen Manifesto, calling new young German filmmakers to revitalize filmmaking in Germany, much like the French New Wave of the previous few years. Although not among the initial group of filmmakers involved, Schlöndorff was quick to align himself with the group and &quot;Young Törless&quot; is considered one of its most important films.

Schlöndorff&#x27;s next film was &quot;Degree of Murder&quot; (1967), a counter-culture-saturated film with a musical score by Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones. The film stars Jones&#x27;s then girlfriend Anita Pallenberg as a young waitress who accidentally kills her boyfriend and hides the body with the help of two male friends. The film was very popular upon release among &quot;swinging sixties&quot; youths.

He then made another film that spoke to the counter-culture generation, &quot;Man on Horseback&quot; (&quot;Michael Kohlhaas – Der Rebell&quot;, 1969), set in medieval Germany. Michael Kohlhaas is a horse trader who has been cheated by a local nobleman and nearly starts a revolution to get revenge. The film starred David Warner, Anna Karina and Anita Pallenberg, and was made in both German and English versions.

Schlöndorff then worked on &quot;Baal&quot; (1970), an adaptation for West German television of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s first play, and cast Rainer Werner Fassbinder in the lead role, along with Margarethe von Trotta, whom Schlöndorff married in 1971. Schlöndorff adapted the story of a self-destructive poet to modern-day Munich. He then made another TV movie, &quot;The Sudden Wealth of the Poor People of Kombach&quot; (1971), also starring Fassbinder. The film depicts seven peasants in 19th-century Germany who rob the local tax collection cart but are so conditioned by their poverty that they cannot handle their newfound wealth.

&#x27; (1972) examines a group of people who have lost their sense of morals and co-stars von Trotta. Von Trotta both starred in and co-wrote Schlöndorff&#x27;s next film, &#x27; (&quot;Strohfeuer&quot;, 1972). The film took a feminist look at the condition of modern women in Munich. Von Trotta plays Elizabeth Junker, a recently divorced woman who must struggle to live her life independently as her husband has everything come easily to him, including the villa and son they shared together as a married couple. The film is loosely based on von Trotta&#x27;s experience of divorcing her first husband.

Schlöndorff then completed the TV movie &quot;&quot; (&quot;Übernachtung in Tirol&quot;, 1974); directed his first opera in Frankfurt, a production of Leoš Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;, in the same year; and adapted the Henry James short story &quot;Georgina&#x27;s Reasons&quot; as &quot;Les raisons de Georgina&quot; (1975) for French TV.

== International success as a filmmaker ==

Schlöndorff (and the New German Cinema movement as a whole) had his first financial hit film with &quot;The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum&quot; (1975). Based on the novel by Heinrich Böll, Schlöndorff co-wrote and co-directed the film with von Trotta, in her directorial debut. The film stars Angela Winkler as Blum, who after falling in love and spending the night with a young army deserter becomes the victim of a corrupt police investigation and predatory tabloid newspaper, which cast her as both a terrorist and a prostitute. The newspaper is based upon the real right-wing German tabloid &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot;, whose publisher Axel Springer was the inspiration for the character Werner Tötges.

In Schlöndorff&#x27;s view, West Germany had fallen into political hysteria over the activities of a terrorist group, the Red Army Faction. The police and journalistic activities in both Böll&#x27;s novel and Schlöndorff&#x27;s film portray the Red Army Faction era as reminiscent of McCarthyism in the 1950s U.S., including illegal police raids, phone tapping and tabloid smears. Böll was heavily attacked after the publication of the novel, but both it and the film were hugely successful in West Germany.

After directing his second opera, &quot;We Come to the River&quot;, in 1976, Schlöndorff followed &quot;The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum&quot; with the equally political &quot;Coup de Grâce&quot; (1976). Based on a novel by French author Marguerite Yourcenar, the film stars von Trotta (who co-wrote the script) as Sophie von Reval, a young left-wing aristocrat who sides with the Bolshevik Revolution after being rejected by a young German soldier preparing to fight the Red Army in 1919. The film depicts the same time period and subject matter that von Trotta revisited in the film &quot;Rosa Luxemburg&quot; (1986).

A supporting actress in &quot;Coup de Grâce&quot; was Valeska Gert, a former cabaret dancer, circus performer and silent film actress who had worked with Greta Garbo and G. W. Pabst. This led to the documentary about her life, &quot;Just for Fun, Just for Play&quot;, in 1977.

Schlöndorff then contributed to the anthology film &quot;Germany in Autumn&quot; (1978), in which nine German filmmakers (including Fassbinder, Alexander Kluge, Edgar Reitz, and Böll) made short films about the hysteria and political chaos in West Germany during the German Autumn of 1977.

Schlöndorff&#x27;s next film was the most successful and ambitious of his career: &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;, released in 1979. The film was based on the novel by Günter Grass, who for years had rejected proposed adaptations of his book until giving Schlöndorff his approval (and assistance) to make the film.

&quot;The Tin Drum&quot; stars David Bennent as the protagonist Oscar Matzerath, who, after receiving a tin drum on his third birthday, makes the conscious choice to stop growing and remain a three-year-old for the rest of his life. He hurls himself down a flight of stairs so as to give the adults around him a rational explanation for his handicap, and later discovers that he has the ability to tactically shatter glass with the power of his high-pitched scream, which he produces whenever anyone attempts to take his tin drum away from him. The film co-stars Angela Winkler as Oscar&#x27;s mother, and Mario Adorf and Daniel Olbrychski as the German and Kashubian (Pole) who may both be his biological fathers. It mostly takes place from the end of World War I to the end of World War II (when Oscar is 20) in the city of Danzig, a Free City under League of Nations protection. It was also the site of the first battle of the war, at the Post Office, in which Oscar takes part.

The film was widely hailed as a masterpiece and shared the Palme d&#x27;or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival with &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, as well as winning the 1979 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.

Schlöndorff collaborated with Stefan Aust, Alexander Kluge and Alexander von Eschwege on the documentary &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1980), a film about the political campaign of arch-conservative Franz Josef Strauss. He next made &quot;The Circle of Deceit&quot; released in 1981. Based on the novel by Nicolas Born, the film concerns the politics and moral struggles of war photographers. The film stars Bruno Ganz and Jerzy Skolimowski as photojournalists covering the Lebanon Civil War in Beirut in 1975.

== Hollywood and later career ==

Schlöndorff&#x27;s first English-language film was &quot;Swann in Love&quot; (1984), an adaptation of the first two volumes of Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. The film was shot in France and financed by Gaumont, and stars Jeremy Irons, Ornella Muti, Alain Delon and Fanny Ardant.

Schlöndorff then went to the United States to make a TV adaptation of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, starring Dustin Hoffman as Willy Loman and John Malkovich as Biff. Both actors won Emmys for their performances and Schlöndorff was nominated for an Emmy for his direction. The film premiered on television in 1985 and was released theatrically throughout Europe over the following years.

Schlöndorff followed this with another TV movie in the US, &quot;A Gathering of Old Men&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Ernest J. Gaines. The film stars Richard Widmark, Holly Hunter and Lou Gossett Jr. and concerns racial discrimination in 1970s Louisiana.

Schlöndorff returned to theatrical films with the Hollywood science fiction film &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1990). The film&#x27;s story takes place in a dystopian near future in which most women are sterile due to pollution. Kate (Natasha Richardson) is arrested after attempting to flee to Canada and forced to become a &quot;Handmaid&quot;. Handmaids are fertile women who are enslaved by the state and put in the households of wealthy men – who have &quot;ceremonial&quot; sex with them in the hope of conceiving a child. She becomes the Handmaid of the Commander (Robert Duvall), Fred, who is married to Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway). To save herself from execution, Kate – renamed &quot;Offred&quot;, since she now is attached to Fred&#x27;s household – allows the Commander&#x27;s driver (Aidan Quinn) to impregnate her and falls in love with him. The film was in competition at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival.

This was soon followed by &quot;Voyager&quot; (1991). The film stars Sam Shepard as a man who survives a plane crash, then finds the love of his life (Julie Delpy) on his next trip and begins to question the rationale of his good luck after having spent most of his life being cruel to others. The film was based on the novel &quot;Homo Faber&quot; by Max Frisch and was not a success at the box-office. He directed the concert film &quot;The Michael Nyman Songbook&quot; released in 1992.

The first of Schlöndorff&#x27;s two documentaries on Austrian-born director Billy Wilder was &quot;Billy Wilder, How Did You Do It?&quot;, in which he and German critic Hellmuth Karasek interviewed Wilder about his career over the course of two weeks in 1988. It was aired on German TV in 1992, and shown on TCM in the USA under the title &quot;Billy Wilder Speaks&quot; in 2006. Schlöndorff had been a great admirer of Wilder for many years and sought his advice during the making of &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;.

Appalled at plans to destroy the historic film studios Babelsberg, Schlöndorff mounted a one-man campaign to save them in the early 1990s. He served as the chief executive for the UFA studio in Babelsberg between 1992 and 1997. During that time, he helped Jiang Wen finish editing his film &quot;In the Heat of the Sun&quot; (1994) in Germany, with the studio&#x27;s full financial support. He also helped to get the film selected for the 51st Venice International Film Festival. In 1996 he contributed to the French TV series &quot;Lumière sur un massacre&quot; with the episode &quot;Le parfait soldat&quot;.

Schlöndorff returned to Germany in to make &quot;The Ogre&quot; (1996), his most well-regarded feature film since &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;. Based on a novel by Michel Tournier and starring John Malkovich as the titular Abel Tiffauges, the film revisited many of the themes and time period of &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;. Tiffauges is a slow-witted French soldier who has been accused of child molestation. After being captured by the Nazis and put in an internment camp, he is made a servant at an elite German training camp and kidnaps local children, officially as a way to recruit them for the camp, but in his mind to protect them. The film was screened in competition at the 1996 Venice Film Festival and won the UNICEF award. The film was released in Germany in 1996 and gained positive reviews. On the audio commentary for &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;, Schlöndorff said that he had wanted to film a sequel to &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;, as the film was based only on the first two thirds of the novel. But because actor David Bennent was too old to reprise the role and he did not want to recast Oscar, he considers &quot;The Ogre&quot; to be an unofficial sequel to his masterpiece.

Schlöndorff returned to Hollywood for &quot;Palmetto&quot; (1998). In a noir plot, the film stars Woody Harrelson as a falsely accused journalist who was sent to jail after uncovering corruption in the local government. After getting out of jail and unable to find work, he encounters Rhea Malroux (Elisabeth Shue), a &quot;femme fatale&quot; who propositions him to help her extort money from her millionaire husband. The film was not a financial success and was Schlöndorff&#x27;s last film in the US to date.
Schlöndorff returned to Germany to make the film &quot;The Legend of Rita&quot; (2000). Loosely based upon the lives of members of the Red Army Faction who exiled to East Germany in the 1970s, the film centers around Rita, who most closely resembles real RAF member Inge Viett. Rita abandons the revolution and lives in East Germany under protection of the secret service, but after German reunification she faces the risk of discovery and consequences for her past crimes.

After the documentary &quot;Ein Produzent hat Seele oder er hat keine&quot; and a contribution to the omnibus film &quot;Ten Minutes Older&quot; (both in 2002), Schlöndorff made &quot;The Ninth Day&quot; (2004). The film is Schlöndorff&#x27;s third film to center around World War II and is based on the diary of Father Jean Bernard. Ulrich Matthes plays Father Henri Kremer, a Catholic priest who is interned at Dachau concentration camp during the Second World War. He is inexplicably released for nine days and sent to Luxembourg. There he meets a young SS soldier who informs him that his mission there is to convince the local bishop to cooperate with the Nazi Party, in which case he will not be sent back to Dachau. He is thus faced with the moral dilemma of betraying his faith or returning to the concentration camp.

Schlöndorff next completed the TV movie &quot;&quot; (2005). He returned to what was Danzig to film &quot;Strike&quot; (2006), a docudrama about labor strikes at the Gdańsk Shipyard during the Polish 1970 protests. The film is also a history of the Solidarity Movement in Poland leading up to the fall of Communism.

Schlöndorff&#x27;s &quot;Ulzhan&quot; (2007) stars Philippe Torreton as a treasure hunter on his way home who has lost his soul and Ayanat Ksenbai as Ulzhan, the woman who falls in love with him. David Bennent also co-starred. In the summer of 2012, he worked with Andrew Turner, who had formerly been a runway model for the late Alexander McQueen. Schlöndorff&#x27;s World War II-era film &quot;Diplomacy&quot;, dedicated to his friend Richard C. Holbrooke, debuted at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. Set in 1944, it explores how the Swedish consul general in Paris, Raoul Nordling, helped persuade Dietrich von Choltitz, the German military governor of Paris, not to obey Hitler&#x27;s orders to destroy the historic city should it fall into enemy hands.

== Personal life ==

Schlöndorff was married to fellow film director Margarethe von Trotta from 1971 to 1991 and helped raise her son from her first marriage. He is currently married to Angelika Schlöndorff, and the couple has one daughter.

He founded the production company Bioskop, which produced both his own and von Trotta&#x27;s films.

In 1991, he was the Head of the Jury at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival.

Schlöndorff teaches film and literature at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, where he conducts an Intensive Summer Seminar.

<text>Dorylaeum or Dorylaion (; ) was an ancient city in Anatolia. It is now an archaeological site located near the city of Eskişehir, Turkey.

Its original location was about 10 km southwest of Eskişehir, at a place now known as Karaca Hisar; about the end of the fourth century B.C. it was moved to a location north of modern Eskişehir.

== History ==

=== Early Bronze Age ===
Şarhöyük (aka Dorylaion) has been excavated since 1989. It has revealed a series of archaeological cultural deposits, the earliest dated to the 3rd millennium BC.

The city flourished during the early Bronze Age. Around 2500 BC, a particularly distinctive culture group is discernible in north-western Anatolia, the &#x27;Demircihüyük Culture&#x27;. Dorylaeum-Sharhöyük was at the center of these cultural developments.

Late Bronze Age (ŞH V) layer of the city is one of the best represented cultural phases on the mound. A new Luwian hieroglyphic seal has been discovered there in 2018. This material represents the Hittite Imperial Period.

Later, the city was also important under the Phrygians.

=== Classical and Medieval periods ===
Much later, Dorylaeum was a Roman trading post. It also was probably a key city of the route the Apostle Paul took on his Second Missionary Voyage in 50 AD. It became a bishopric when part of the Late Roman province of Phrygia Salutaris.

In the third century AD, it was threatened by Gothic raids. The Roman army that was based in Asia minor was spread thin, and the navy had moved west from the Northern city of Sinope, therefore the provincials were left exposed. These Goths came from the trans-danubian region on the black sea. When the city was under threat, the people used dedicatory statues to build their wall quicker, indicating their rush to protect themselves against the invaders. After the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 it was taken by the Seljuk Turks.

Dorylaeum was the site of two battles during the crusades. In 1097, during the First Crusade, the crusaders defeated the Seljuks there, in their first major victory. During the Second Crusade it was the site of a major crusader defeat, which effectively ended the German contribution to the crusade.

Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus fortified Dorylaeum in 1175.The contemporary Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates relates that Manuel did not destroy the fortifications of Dorylaeum, as he had agreed to do as part of the treaty he negotiated with the Seljuk Turkish sultan Kilij Arslan II immediately after the Battle of Myriokephalon. The sultan&#x27;s response to this development was not a direct attack on Dorylaeum but the dispatch of a large army to ravage the rich Meander valley to the south.

Dorylaeum was described by the Muslim author al-Harawi (died 1215) as a place of medicinal hot springs on the frontier at the end of Christian territory.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Dorylaeum became a bishopric under the Byzantine Empire and was a suffragan the Metropolitan of Synnada in Phrygia.

Seven bishops are known from the fourth to the ninth century, the most famous being Eusebius. The see is mentioned as late as the twelfth century among the suffragans of Synnada, but must have been suppressed soon after.

=== Titular see ===
Dorylaeum is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees.
The diocese was nominally restored as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric in 1715 as &quot;Dorylaeum&quot;, which is spelled &quot;Dorylaëum&quot; since 1925.

<text>The University of Delaware (colloquially known as UD, UDel, or Delaware) is a privately governed, state-assisted land-grant research university in Newark, Delaware, United States. UD offers four associate&#x27;s programs, 163 bachelor&#x27;s programs, 136 master&#x27;s programs, and 64 doctoral programs across its ten colleges and schools. The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Wilmington, Lewes, and Georgetown, Delaware. With 24,221 students , UD is the largest university in Delaware by enrollment.

UD is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, UD spent $186 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 119th in the nation. It is recognized with the Community Engagement Classification by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

UD students, alumni, and sports teams are known as the &quot;Fightin&#x27; Blue Hens&quot;, more commonly shortened to &quot;Blue Hens&quot;, and the school colors are Delaware blue and gold. UD sponsors 21 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s NCAA Division I sports teams and have competed in the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA) since 2001. The men’s division 1 is hockey team competes in the ESCHL.

==History==
===Early years: Newark Academy===

The University of Delaware traces its origins to 1743, when Presbyterian minister Francis Alison opened a &quot;Free School&quot; in his home in New London, Pennsylvania. During its early years, the school was run under the auspices of the Philadelphia Synod of the Presbyterian Church. The school changed its name and location several times. It moved to Newark by 1765 and received a charter from the colonial Penn government as the Academy of Newark in 1769. In 1781, the academy trustees petitioned the Delaware General Assembly to grant the academy the powers of a college, but no action was taken on this request.

===Transformation to Delaware College===
In 1818, the Delaware legislature authorized the trustees of the Newark Academy to operate a lottery in order to raise funds with which to establish a college. Commencement of the lottery, however, was delayed until 1825, in large part because some trustees, several of whom were Presbyterian ministers, objected to involvement with a lottery on moral grounds.

In 1832, the academy trustees selected the site for the college and entered into a contract for the erection of the college building. Construction of that building (now called Old College) began in late 1832 or in 1833. In January 1833 the academy trustees petitioned the Delaware legislature to incorporate the college and on February 5, 1833, the legislature incorporated Newark College, which was charged with instruction in languages, arts and sciences, and granted the power to confer degrees. All of the academy trustees became trustees of the college, and the college absorbed the academy, with Newark Academy becoming the preparatory department of Newark College.

Newark College commenced operations on May 8, 1834, with a collegiate department and an academic department, both of which were housed in Old College. In January 1835, the Delaware legislature passed legislation specifically authorizing the Newark Academy trustees to suspend operations and to allow the educational responsibilities of the academy to be performed by the academic department of Newark College. If, however, the college ever ceased to have an academic department, the trustees of the academy were required to revive the academy.

In 1843, the name of the college was changed to Delaware College.

The college was supported by a state authorized lottery until 1845. By the late 1840s, with the loss of lottery proceeds, the college faced serious financial problems. Although enrollment did increase to levels that would not be surpassed until the 1900s (there were 118 college students in 1854), the financial condition of the school deteriorated further. After a student fracas in 1858 resulted in the death of a student, the college suspended operations in 1859. The academy continued to operate.

===Land-grant college===
The Civil War delayed the reopening of the college. In 1867, college trustees lobbied the Delaware legislature for Delaware College to be designated as Delaware&#x27;s land-grant college pursuant to the Morrill Land-Grant College Act. Introduced by Congressman Justin S. Morrill of Vermont in 1857 and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862, the Morrill Land-Grant College Act granted public lands to each state in order to establish schools to teach agriculture and engineering. On Jan. 12, 1869, the Board of Trustees of Delaware College signed an agreement to become the state&#x27;s land-grant institution. In exchange, the state received a one-half interest in the property of the college and the authority to appoint half of the members of the board of trustees. The Morrill Land-Grant College Act granted Delaware the title to 90,000 acres in Montana which it sold and invested the profits into bonds used to fund the college.

Delaware College&#x27;s new status as a semipublic college led to the termination of its official connection with the private academy. In 1869, the Newark Academy was revived as a separate institution operating under the 1769 charter.

In 1870, Delaware College reopened. It offered classical, scientific and, as required by its land-grant status, agricultural courses of study. In an effort to boost enrollment, women were admitted to the college between 1872 and 1885.

In 1887, Congress passed the Hatch Act, which provided Delaware College with funding with which to establish an agricultural experiment station. In 1890, the college purchased nine acres of land for an experimental farm located next to its campus. In 1890 the college became the recipient of more federal aid when the New Morrill Act was passed. It provided for annual payments to support land-grant colleges. Under the law, the State of Delaware initially received $15,000 per year, which was to be increased by $1,000 per year until it reached $25,000. Delaware College received 80% of this money. (It did not receive all of it because the law provided that in states in which land-grant colleges did not admit black students, an equitable amount of the granted money had to be used to educate the excluded students. Delaware College had never admitted black students (although it had admitted Native American and Asian students), and as a result the state of Delaware established Delaware State College near Dover for black students, which opened in 1892.) In 1891 and 1893 Delaware College received appropriations from the State of Delaware for the construction of new buildings. One new building built with this money was Recitation Hall.

As a result of this additional funding, Delaware College was invigorated. New buildings, improved facilities, and additional professors helped the college attract more students. Student life also became more active during this period. In 1889 the first football game involving a team representing the college was played. Also in 1889, the college adopted blue and gold as the school&#x27;s colors.

It was not until 1914, though, that the Women&#x27;s College opened on an adjoining campus, offering women degrees in Home Economics, Education, and Arts and Sciences. Brick archways at Memorial Hall separated the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s campuses and gave rise to the legend of the Kissing Arches (where students would kiss good night before returning to their respective residence halls).

In 1921, Delaware College was renamed the University of Delaware. It officially became a coeducational institution in 1945 when it merged with the Women&#x27;s College of Delaware.

The university grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century. After World War II, UD enrollment skyrocketed, thanks to the G.I. Bill. In the late 1940s, almost two-thirds of the students were veterans. Since the 1950s, UD has quadrupled its enrollment and greatly expanded its faculty, its academic programs and its research enterprise.

In 2010–11, the university conducted a feasibility study in support of plans to add a law school focused on corporate and patent law. At its completion, the study suggested that the planned addition was not within the university&#x27;s funding capability given the nation&#x27;s economic climate at the time. Capital expenses were projected at $100 million, and the operating deficit in the first ten years would be $165 million. The study assumed an initial class of two hundred students entering in the fall of 2015. Widener University has Delaware&#x27;s only law school.

=== Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus ===
On October 23, 2009, the University of Delaware signed an agreement with Chrysler to purchase a shuttered vehicle assembly plant adjacent to the university for $24.25 million as part of Chrysler&#x27;s bankruptcy restructuring plan. The university has developed the site into the Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus. The site is the new home of UD&#x27;s College of Health Sciences, which includes teaching and research laboratories and several public health clinics. The STAR Campus also includes research facilities for UD&#x27;s vehicle-to-grid technology, as well as Delaware Technology Park, SevOne, CareNow, Independent Prosthetics and Orthotics, and the East Coast headquarters of Bloom Energy. In 2020, UD opened the Ammon Pinozzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center, which became the new home of the UD-led National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals. Also, Chemours recently opened its global research and development facility, known as the Discovery Hub, on the STAR Campus in 2020. The new Newark Regional Transportation Center on the STAR Campus will serve passengers of Amtrak and regional rail.

==Campus==


The campus itself is divided into four areas: Main, Laird, and South campuses, as well as the Delaware Technology Park.

Main Campus, which has most of the academic and residential buildings, is centered on a roughly north–south axis between South College Avenue and Academy Street. At the center of the campus is Memorial Hall, which once divided the Women&#x27;s College from Delaware College. North and south of Memorial Hall is a large, roughly rectangular green space known either as &quot;The Green&quot; or &quot;The Mall,&quot; around which are many of the oldest buildings on campus. Though the buildings were constructed at various times over the course of more than a century, they follow a cohesive Georgian design aesthetic. The Green area is further subdivided into three areas. &quot;North Central,&quot; which is north of Delaware Avenue, contains the original men&#x27;s dormitories (now co-educational) of what was then Delaware College, as well as several classroom buildings north of Main Street in what had been the original Engineering departments. &quot;Central,&quot; which lies between Delaware Avenue and Memorial Hall, contains many large classroom buildings and laboratories. &quot;South Central,&quot; which extends from Memorial Hall to Park Place, houses the original Women&#x27;s dormitories, as well as some classroom buildings and the Morris Library.

Laird Campus, which has several dormitories as well as a conference center, hotel, and the Christiana Towers apartment complex (currently closed), lies north of Cleveland Avenue between New London Road and North College Avenue. It is primarily residential. It is the former home to the Pencader Complex, which was demolished and replaced by three new residence halls. A total of four residence hall buildings have been built, three named after the three University alumni who signed the Declaration of Independence (George Read, Thomas McKean, and James Smith, who signed for Pennsylvania); the fourth residence hall was named Independence Hall. In addition, the construction of a Marriott Courtyard run by the Hospitality Business Management department expanded the campus.

South Campus has the agricultural school, all of the sports stadiums (including Delaware Stadium and the Bob Carpenter Center), and the Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus, which is built on the site of a former Chrysler vehicle assembly plant. It lies south of the Northeast rail corridor and north of Christina Parkway (Delaware Route 4)

The Delaware Technology Park, which lies to the far east of Main Campus, is located north of the train tracks, south of Wyoming Road, east of Library Avenue (Delaware Route 72) and west of Marrows Road and has several research laboratories, classroom buildings, and offices. The Children&#x27;s Campus, located across the Library Avenue from the Delaware Technology Park, is a 15-acre site home to the Early Learning Center (ages 6 weeks to third grade), the Lab School (ages 6 months to kindergarten) and The College School (first to eighth grades). Also located on-site are UD&#x27;s Cooperative Extension Master Gardeners Program and the Center for Disabilities Studies.

In 1891, prominent Philadelphia architect Frank Furness designed Recitation Hall. Several buildings (Wolf, Sussex, and Harter Halls) were designed by Frank Miles Day, who also designed the formal campus landscape. From 1918 to 1952, Marian Cruger Coffin was appointed the university&#x27;s landscape architect, a position which required her to unite the university&#x27;s two separate campuses (the men&#x27;s to the north and the women&#x27;s to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them with a circle (now called Magnolia Circle) instead of curving the straight paths, which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.

Other major facilities that have opened since 2000 include:
* The David and Louise Roselle Center For The Arts, with facilities for the school&#x27;s music and theater programs, was opened in 2006.
* In 2013, the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (ISE) Laboratory opened on the corner of Academy and Lovett streets. In 2015, it was named the Patrick T. Harker ISE Laboratory in honor of the university&#x27;s 26th president.

==Organization and administration==
In 2015, the UD Board of Trustees elected Dennis Assanis as the 28th President of the University of Delaware; he took office in June 2016. He succeeded Nancy , former dean of the university&#x27;s College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, who served as interim president in 2015–16. She was named 27th president of the university near the end of her service; she was the institution&#x27;s first female president. served after the departure of President Patrick Harker in 2015 to serve as the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

===Tuition and funding===
For the 2022–23 academic year, undergraduate tuition per semester is $14,822 for Delaware residents and $36,082 for non-residents. The total cost of attendance for the 2022–23 academic year (tuition, mandatory fees, room and board) is $32,444 for Delawareans and $54,964 for non-residents.

The university receives funding from a variety of sources as a consequence of its historical origins. Among those sources is the State of Delaware budget. In fiscal year 2020, 10% of the university&#x27;s revenue came from government grants. Tuition, room, board, and fees were 57% of the university&#x27;s total revenue.

The Delaware First fundraising and engagement campaign was the largest philanthropic campaign in UD history. Launched in November 2017, the campaign exceeded the goal of $750 million ahead of schedule, and extended the goal to $1 billion in October 2021. The Campaign concluded in June 2023 with a record-breaking 113,402 University supporters contributing more than $1.05 billion.

===University services===
The University of Delaware Emergency Care Unit (UDECU) is a registered student organization at the university, which provides emergency medical services to the campus and surrounding community. UDECU has approximately 50 members, all of which are volunteers and students at the University of Delaware. UDECU operates one basic life support ambulance (UD-1), one first response vehicle (UD-2), and a bike team. Advanced life support is provided by New Castle County Emergency Medical Services.

The University of Delaware Police Department is responsible for law enforcement on UD&#x27;s three campuses. The police represent one branch of the University of Delaware Department of Public Safety, whose employees also include security officers, as well as dispatchers, EMTs, and Police Cadets.

==Academics==
The university offers more than 150 undergraduate degree programs and, due to the number of academic options, many students complete dual degrees as well as double majors and minors. UD students have access to work and internship opportunities, worldwide study abroad programs, research and service learning programs.

===Undergraduate admissions===
The student body at the University of Delaware is primarily an undergraduate population. For the Class of 2028 (enrolled fall 2024), Delaware received 37,472 applications and accepted 23,818 (63.5%). The university is need-blind for domestic applicants. Of those accepted, 4,617 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 18.7%. Delaware&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 91.5%, with 83.6% going on to graduate within six years.

Of the 60% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1170–1350. Of the 11% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 26 and 31. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 2 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.

===Rankings===

The university is ranked 352nd (tie) globally according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; (2023). The university is ranked between 401st and 500th globally according to &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; (2024).

The &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the University of Delaware&#x27;s engineering graduate program as #47 for 2022 and the undergraduate program as #53 for 2021. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the undergraduate chemical engineering program #7 in the country for 2021 and the graduate chemical engineering programs as #8 in the country for 2022.

Currently, more than 3,600 graduate students are enrolled at UD. The university offers more than 200 graduate and professional degree programs.

===Institutes===
The Institute of Energy Conversion at the University of Delaware is the oldest solar energy research institute in the world. It was established by Karl Boer in 1972 to pioneer research on thin film solar cells and today is one of the only laboratories in the world with expertise in Si, CdTe, and CuInSe2 based solar cells. This included the development of one of the first solar powered homes, a structure still utilized by the university&#x27;s student-run ambulance service, the University of Delaware Emergency Care Unit. Recently the IEC was the number one recipient of the DOE Sunshot Initiative and was awarded 5 grants totaling $9.1 million to research next generation solar cells to reduce the cost of solar cells by 75% by the end of the decade.

The Delaware Environmental Institute launched on October 23, 2009. DENIN is charged with conducting research and promoting and coordinating knowledge partnerships that integrate environmental science, engineering and policy.

The University of Delaware Energy Institute was inaugurated September 19, 2008. UDEI has been selected to receive a $3 million a year grant for advanced solar research.

The John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance was established in 2000 at the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics. Its aim is to propose changes in corporate structure and management through education and interaction. The Center provides a forum for those interested in corporate governance issues.

In February 2017, the School of Public Policy and Administration announced the creation of the Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Institute (Biden Institute), named after alumnus Joe Biden, the 46th president of the United States, who at the time had recently finished his term as the 47th vice president.

===Study abroad===
The University of Delaware was the first American university to begin a study-abroad program, which was later adopted by many other institutions. The program began when Professor Raymond Watson Kirkbride took a group of eight students to Paris, France, during the fall semester of 1923. Since this initial trip, the University of Delaware has expanded its study-abroad program, which now encompasses more than 40 countries. About one-third of UD undergraduate students take advantage of study-abroad experiences prior to completing their bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

Delaware&#x27;s study-abroad program offers many options for students. Undergraduates have the option of studying abroad for a five-week winter or summer session, or an entire semester.

==Student life==
===Music===
The University of Delaware has a variety of musical performance opportunities available to students, including a wind ensemble, orchestra, and jazz and symphonic band. There are also a number of jazz groups available, including two large ensembles, and a smaller group that focus on improvisation. All ensembles are open by audition to all students at the university, and can be taken either for credit or for no credit. The school also has a steel drum ensemble, and an early music ensemble. There are also a variety of choral ensembles, including the University of Delaware Chorale, an all-women&#x27;s choir, and three choirs, also open to community members, that constitute the Schola Cantorum. The music department&#x27;s home is the Amy E. du Pont Music Building, named for Amy Elizabeth du Pont, a prominent benefactor of the university during the 20th century.

In addition, the University of Delaware has a marching band, the University of Delaware Fightin&#x27; Blue Hen Marching Band. The band ranges from 300 to 350 members every year and can be seen performing at every home football game as well as at various festivals and competitions, including the Collegiate Marching Band Festival in Allentown. Additionally, the marching band was selected to perform in the 56th Presidential Inaugural Parade in 2009.

In 2006, the new Center for the Arts building opened. This building has a number of recital halls and a large number of practice rooms, most with upright pianos. The practice rooms are locked and cannot be used by students who are not music majors or in an official UD ensemble. The university employs a tiered access system, with larger rooms and rooms with grand pianos being reserved for certain groups of students. In addition the music department also uses their old building, with offices, classrooms, practice rooms, and recital halls. This building has public-access practice rooms with pianos.

In 2005, the University of Delaware Chorale, under the direction of Paul D. Head and accompanied by Betsy Kent, were invited to perform at the American Choral Directors Association&#x27;s International Convention in Los Angeles. In April 2007, the Chorale won the Grand Prix at the Tallinn International Choral Festival in Estonia, having scored higher than 40 other choirs from around the world. In 2010 the Chorale competed in two categories of the 42nd Annual Tolosa Choral Competition in Tolosa, Spain; they received a Bronze and a Silver award. UD-16, a chamber ensemble of Chorale, also competed in Tolosa in two categories and won two Silver awards. In the Summer of 2012 the Chorale was the only American College Choir to be invited to the International Society for Music Education Conference in Thessaloniki, Greece; the UD Steele Ensemble was also invited. On that same tour, the chorale placed in a close second at the Grand Prix of the 25th Bela Bartok International Choral Competition. In 2000, the music department purchased an 18th-century Ceruti violin for professor and violinist Xiang Gao.

In December 2019, the Department of Music in the College of Arts and Sciences was officially renamed the School of Music to Calculus .

The university also has a student run radio station, 91.3 WVUD, as well as several a cappella groups including one all-female, one all-male, and five mixed groups, several of which compete regularly at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). The most successful group is Vocal Point, who placed third at ICCA finals in 2014. In 2020, The A Cappella Archive ranked UD Vocal Point at #12 all-time among ICCA-competing groups.

In addition, the University of Delaware currently has two music fraternities: Phi Mu Alpha for men and Sigma Alpha Iota for women. Both organizations are active in the music community; hosting a variety of recitals and service events in and around the Newark area.

===Media===

There are currently two student publications at Delaware: &quot;The Review&quot; and &quot;UDress&quot;, as well as radio and television stations.

====Print==== 
&quot;The Review&quot; is a weekly student publication, released in print and online on Tuesdays. It is an independent publication and receives no financial support from the university. It is distributed at several locations across campus, including Morris Library, the Perkins Student Center and the Trabant University Center, as well as various academic buildings and the dining halls. &quot;The Review&quot;&#x27;s office is located at 250 Perkins Student Center, facing Academy Street, and is above the offices of WVUD. In 2004, it was a National Newspaper Pacemaker Award Finalist, and was also named one of the ten best non-daily college newspapers by the Associated Collegiate Press. It currently has a print circulation of 10,000.

&quot;UDress&quot; magazine is the on-campus fashion magazine which publishes one issue per semester, in conjunction with fashion events.

====Broadcast====
The student-run, non-commercial, educational radio station at Delaware broadcasts on 91.3 and uses the call letters WVUD, which the university purchased from the University of Dayton in the 1980s. Although not its intended call letter pronunciation, &#x27;VUD has taken on the slogan &quot;the Voice of the University of Delaware.&quot; They are licensed to the city of Newark, Delaware and broadcasts with a power of 1,000 watts 24 hours a day with its offices and studios located in the Perkins Student Center.

The transmitting facilities are located atop the Christiana East Tower residence hall. WVUD is operated by University of Delaware students, a university staff of two, and community members. No prior radio experience is necessary, nor is there a need to enroll in any certain major to become a part of WVUD. The radio station has a variety of programming, featuring both music and talk formats.

STN is the student-run, non-commercial, educational television station at the University of Delaware. The station broadcasts second-run movies, original student produced content as well as live sports coverage. The initials, STN, originally stood for Shane Thomas Network, later changed to Student Television Network.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Approximately 26% of the University of Delaware&#x27;s undergraduate student population is affiliated with a fraternity or sorority. There are over 26 fraternities and 20 sororities (chapters &amp; colonies) in the Interfraternity Council (IFC), National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), Multicultural Greek Congress (MGC) and Special Interest Greek Council.

===Alcohol use===
A campus website claims that a 1993 study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that high-risk drinking at UD exceeded the national norm. On this survey, a majority of students reported binge drinking more than once in two weeks. The average consumption for students was nine drinks per week, while 29% reported that they drink on 10 or more occasions per month. UD students were found to be more aware of policies, prevention programs, and enforcement risks than the national average.

In 2005, on the Newark campus of the university 1140 students were picked up by the campus police for alcohol-related violations. Of these, 120 led to arrests. These figures are up from previous years, 1062 in 2004 and 1026 in 2003. This represents approximately 6% of the student population. At least one student organization has undertaken the goal of &quot;providing fun activities for those who chose not to drink&quot; and to &quot;promote the idea that one doesn&#x27;t need alcohol to have a good time.&quot;

In 2008, a University of Delaware freshman died of alcohol poisoning after attending a party hosted by members of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, where the student was pledging. A student visiting from another college died on March 19, 2016, in an alcohol-related incident.

==Athletics==


The athletic teams at Delaware are known as the Fightin&#x27; Blue Hens with a mascot named YoUDee. YoUDee is a Blue Hen Chicken, after the team names and the state bird of Delaware. YoUDee was elected into the mascot hall of fame in 2006, and is an eight-time UCA Open Division Mascot National Champion.

UD offers 21 varsity sports, which compete in NCAA Division I (FCS for football). Delaware is currently a member of the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA) in non-football sports and the CAA&#x27;s technically separate football league, CAA Football. In July 2024, UD will start a transition to the top level of college football, Division I FBS, and will join Conference USA a year later. Delaware was a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference in football until the 2006 season. The Fightin&#x27; Blue Hens football teams have won six national titles, including the 2003 NCAA I-AA Championship. In 2007, the Delaware Blue Hens were the runners up in the NCAA I-AA National Championship game, but were defeated by defending champions Appalachian State. In 2010, the Delaware Blue Hens were again runners up in the National Championship game, losing to Eastern Washington 20–19 after being up 19–0 earlier in the game.

Delaware&#x27;s long serving Director of Athletics from 1984-2009, Edgar N. Johnson was a UD swim and track coach who swam for Delaware from 1962-1966. During his tenure, he oversaw construction of a new basketball venue, the Bob Carpenter Center, Delaware&#x27;s first artificial surface facility at Rullo Stadium, and major renovations of Delaware Stadium, Delaware Field House, and Carpenter Sports Building. In his honor, The Edgar Johnson Award is given each year to the University of Delaware senior male athlete who best exhibits the characteristics of dedication, hard work, and fairness, and consistently reaches for excellence. During his tenure, his teams were awarded 10 consecutive America East Commissioner’s Cup Awards, won a total of 83 titles in their conferences, and appeared in 32 NCAA Championships.

Former head football coaches Bill Murray, Dave Nelson and Harold &quot;Tubby&quot; Raymond are College Football Hall of Fame inductees. Delaware is one of only two schools to have three straight head coaches inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame (Georgia Tech is the other).

Delaware&#x27;s only other NCAA National Championships came in 1983 for Women&#x27;s Division I Lacrosse. The Blue Hens have won 29 CAA championships since joining in 2001:

Unofficially, the women&#x27;s rowing team has won the CAA title four times since 2001, placing second the other two times. The 2007 men&#x27;s lacrosse program reached the final four of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in its history.

On March 7, 2012, the Division 1 men&#x27;s ice hockey team (a non-varsity team) won the ACHA National Championship. UD defeated Oakland University 5–1, capturing its first title.

&quot;The Delaware Fight Song&quot; first appeared in the Student Handbook in 1933. It was composed by alumnus George F. Kelly (Class of 1915).

===Intrastate competition===
In November 2007, it was announced that the University of Delaware and Delaware State University would have their first game against each other, the game being in the first round of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision playoffs. The game was played on November 23, with University of Delaware winning 44–7. Delaware has won all of the regular season match-ups, which have been called the Route 1 Rivalry. In all, the two schools played eleven games between 2007 and 2022. In 2019, UD and DSU announced that they have scheduled six games against each other from 2024 through 2030, including the first two games at DSU&#x27;s Alumni Stadium.

==Controversies==
===Handling of violence===
In October 2021, a sophomore male student was accused of assaulting a female student in an off-campus apartment, allegedly having held her captive there for about four hours after choking her unconscious and threatening to kill her. This all happened before throwing her down a flight of stairs. Although he was later arrested on assault, kidnapping and other charges and suspended from the university and barred from its campus, many students protested the perceived inaction from the university which took five days to issue a statement about the incident. The university&#x27;s lack of a timely response was also highlighted by a student in 2019 who protested after the Title IX process was extended to 100 days instead of the mandated 60 days.

===Orientation===
In the fall of 2007, the university implemented a new residence-life education program that was criticized for forcing students into polarizing discussions. The program was abandoned in November of the same year.

===Power plant===
The university agreed to lease 43 acres on the STAR campus to The Data Centers (TDC) for the construction of the data center. The data center plan included a combined heat cycle natural gas-fired power plant capable of generating 248 megawatts of power. TDC claimed that the power plant was critical to ensuring an uninterrupted electrical power supply to the facility, which is critical for data integrity. The TDC business plan also called for sale of excess electricity. Portions of the Newark community questioned the business plan, claiming that the power plant is not an auxiliary part of the data center but a separate industrial use, which would violate the zoning of the STAR campus.

On April 28, 2014, the City of Newark Board of Adjustment upheld its April 19, 2014 ruling that the power plant is an accessory to the data center and that no rezoning was required. The ruling is presently under appeal. The University of Delaware&#x27;s Sustainability Task Force sent an open letter to President Harker citing concerns that the project violates the university&#x27;s strategic plan and Climate Action Plan. On May 4, 2014, the University Faculty Senate voted 43 to 0 (with 8 abstentions) to recommend to the administration that it not allow construction of The Data Center on UD&#x27;s STAR campus if The Data Center includes any fossil-fuel-burning power plant. On July 10, 2014, the university announced that it was terminating the lease for the project.

==Notable alumni and faculty==

<text>Yodeling (also jodeling) is a form of singing which involves repeated and rapid changes of pitch between the low-pitch chest register (or &quot;chest voice&quot;) and the high-pitch head register or falsetto. The English word &quot;yodel&quot; is derived from the German word &quot;jodeln&quot;, meaning &quot;to utter the syllable &quot;jo&quot;&quot; (pronounced &quot;yo&quot;). This vocal technique is used in many cultures worldwide. Recent scientific research concerning yodeling and non-Western cultures suggests that music and speech may have evolved from a common prosodic precursor.

Alpine yodeling was a longtime rural tradition in Europe, and became popular in the 1830s as entertainment in theaters and music halls.
In Europe, yodeling is still a major feature of folk music (&quot;Volksmusik&quot;) from Switzerland, Austria, and southern Germany and can be heard in many contemporary folk songs, which are also featured on regular TV broadcasts.

In the United States, traveling minstrels were yodeling in the 19th century, and, in 1920, the Victor recording company listed 17 yodels in their catalogue. In 1928, blending Alpine yodeling with African American work and blues music styles and traditional folk music, Jimmie Rodgers released his recording &quot;Blue Yodel No. 1&quot;. Rodgers&#x27; &quot;blue yodel&quot;, a term sometimes used to differentiate the earlier Austrian yodeling from the American form of yodeling introduced by Rodgers, created an instant national craze for yodeling in the United States; according to a black musician who lived near Rodgers in Mississippi, both black and white musicians began to copy Rodgers&#x27; style of vocal delivery.

When sound films first became available in the 1930s the industry began to turn out numerous films to meet the nation&#x27;s fascination with the American cowboy. The singing cowboy was a subtype of the archetypal cowboy hero of early Western films, popularized by many of the B-movies of the 1930s and 1940s.
The transformation of Rodgers&#x27; blue yodel to the cowboy yodel involved both a change in rhythm and a move away from Southern blues-type lyrics. Some yodels contained more of the Alpine type of yodel as well. Most famous of the singing cowboy film stars were Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, both accomplished yodelers. The popularity of yodeling lasted through the 1940s, but by the 1950s it became rare to hear yodeling in country and western music.

== History of Alpine yodeling ==
Most experts agree that yodeling was used in the Central Alps by herders calling their flocks or to communicate between Alpine villages. The multi-pitched &quot;yelling&quot; later became part of the region&#x27;s traditional lore and musical expression. The earliest record of a yodel is in 1545, where it is described as &quot;the call of a cowherd from Appenzell&quot;. Music historian Timothy Wise writes:

From its earliest entry into European music of whatever type, the yodel tended to be associated with nature, instinct, wilderness, pre-industrial and pastoral civilization, or similar ideas. It continues to be associated with rural and folk musics or to connote those in other contexts. Because of this original folk connection, yodeling remained associated with the outdoors, with rustic rather than sophisticated personae, and with particular emotional or psychological states or semantic fields.

British stage performances by yodelers were common in the nineteenth century. Sir Walter Scott wrote in his June 4, 1830, journal entry that &quot;Anne wants me to go hear the Tyrolese Minstrels but ... I cannot but think their yodeling ... is a variation upon the tones of a jackass.&quot; In Europe, yodeling is still a major feature of folk music (Volksmusik) from Switzerland, Austria, and southern Germany, and the Swiss Amish in the United States maintain the practice of yodeling to this day.

== Yodeling around the world ==
Apart from the Alps, yodeling can be found in the Solomon Islands, Hawaii, Madagascar, the US, Romania, Bulgaria, and Africa.

Although associated with the Swiss Alps and Austrian Tyrol, ethnomusicologists believe that the origins of yodeling can be traced back tens of thousands of years to ancient African nomadic hunter-gatherer societies.

In Scandinavian folk music, the oral-song tradition Kulning (), also called &quot;huving&quot;, is a form of signal song, a shout to make themselves known over a long distance, especially used in the mountains. Usually it is linked to transhumance tradition. The cry could be individually designed so that it was not just a cry for contact, but also a signifier used to identify the singer. The cry may have a form of text, but is just as well without words. Laling is related to yodeling in Switzerland and Austria. The overture &quot;Hjalarljod&quot; has a background in the phenomenon of yodeling. Laling is a mix of yelling and singing, and is closely related to &quot;lokk&quot;. Huving was spent in the woods and mountains to call the animals, and get in touch with other people, such as other shepherds or people on the neighboring mountain farm and to give messages over long distances.

In Persian classical music, singers frequently use &quot;tahrir&quot; (&quot;tremolo&quot; in English), a yodeling technique that oscillates on neighbor tones. It is similar to the Swiss yodel, and is used as an ornament or trill in phrases that have long syllables, and usually falls at the end of a phrase. Tahrir is also prevalent in Azerbaijani, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Turkish, Armenian, Afghan, and Central Asian musical traditions, and to a lesser extent in Pakistani and some Indian music.

In Georgian traditional music, yodeling takes the form of &quot;krimanchuli&quot; technique, and is used as a top part in three- or four-part polyphony. Yodel-like shamanistic traditions are also seen among the Turkic Sakha people of Siberia, the Inuit of the Arctic regions of Greenland and the Saami of Scandinavia. Among the Irish and Scottish peoples hints of yodeling-like sounds are also evident. In Sakha Yakutian, yodeling plays a very important role in the way to address nature and to plead for the continuance of life.

In Central Africa, Pygmy singers use yodels within their elaborate polyphonic singing, and the Shona people of Zimbabwe sometimes yodel while playing the mbira. The Mbuti of the Congo incorporate distinctive whistles and yodels
into their songs. Living from hunting and gathering, they sing hunting and harvest songs and use yodelling to call each other. In 1952, ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey recorded their songs and they have been released on compact discs.

In Romanian traditional folk music, yodeling takes the form of &quot;horea cu noduri&quot;, mostly used by shepherds to call their sheep or as a way of expressing sorrow. &quot;Horea cu noduri&quot; (knots singing style) is a particular manner of &quot;doina&quot; interpretation acquired through a guttural vocal technique, the knots being strikes of the glottis through the neck muscles contractions.

Many Hawaiian songs feature falsetto. In Hawaiian-style falsettocalled the singer, usually male, emphasizes the break between registers. Sometimes the singer exaggerates the break through repetition, as a yodel. As with other aspects of Hawaiian music, falsetto developed from a combination of sources, including pre-European Hawaiian chanting, early Christian hymn singing and the songs and yodeling of immigrant cowboys, called &quot;paniolos&quot; in the Hawaiian language, during the Kamehameha Reign in the 1800s when cowboys were brought from Mexico to teach Hawaiians how to care for cattle.

Yodelling arrived in America in the mid-19th century and was propagated through travelling entertainment shows.

== Technique ==
Human voices have at least two distinct vocal registers, called the &quot;head&quot; and &quot;chest&quot; voices. Most people can sing tones within a certain range of lower pitches in their chest voice and tones within a certain range of higher pitch in their head voice. Falsetto is an &quot;unsupported&quot; register forcing vocal cords into a higher pitch without any head or chest voice air support. The range of overlap between registers, called the passaggio, can be challenging for untrained singers. Experienced singers can control their voices in this range, easily switching between registers. Yodeling is a version of this technique in which a singer might change register several times in only a few seconds and at a high volume. Repeated alternation between registers at a singer&#x27;s passaggio pitch range produces a very distinctive sound. For example, in the famous &quot;Yodel – Ay – EEE – Oooo&quot;, the &quot;EEE&quot; is sung in the head voice while all other syllables are in the chest voice.

Bart Plantenga, author of &quot;Yodel-Ay-Ee-Oooo: The Secret History of Yodeling Around the World&quot;, explains the technique:

The basic yodel requires sudden alterations of vocal register from a low-pitched chest voice to high falsetto tones sung on vowel sounds: AH, OH, OO for chest notes and AY or EE for the falsetto. Consonants are used as levers to launch the dramatic leap from low to high, giving it its unique ear-penetrating and distance-spanning power.

The best places for Alpine-style yodelling are those with an echo. Ideal natural locations include not only mountain ranges but lakes, rocky gorges or shorelines, and high or open areas with one or more distant rock faces.

== Yodeling in the United States ==
It is thought that yodeling was first introduced to the United States by German immigrants in Pennsylvania in the early 1800s. As the new settlers traveled south through the Appalachian Mountains and beyond into the Deep South they came into contact with Scots and Irish immigrants, Scandinavians (practitioners of a unique yodeling called kulning), and other nationalities including African enslaved people who communicated with &quot;field hollers&quot;, described by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1853 as a &quot;long, loud, musical shout, rising and falling and breaking into falsetto&quot;.

In 1839, the Tyrolese Minstrels toured the United States and started an American craze for Alpine music. During the 1840s, dozens of German, Swiss, and Austrian singing groups crisscrossed the country entertaining audiences with a combination of singing, yodeling, and &quot;Alpine harmony.&quot; The popularity of the European groups led to the formation of many American family singing groups as well. The most popular was the Hutchison Family Singers who toured, singing harmony and yodeling. Minstrel shows parodied the Hutchison&#x27;s yodeling with their own, calling it &quot;Tyrolesian business&quot;. In 1853, Christy&#x27;s Minstrels burlesqued (parodied) the Hutchinson Family singing &#x27;We Come From the Hills With Tyrolean Echo&#x27;.

Other traveling American minstrels were yodeling in the United States as well. Tom Christian was the first American yodeling minstrel, appearing in 1847 in Chicago. Recordings of yodelers were made in 1892 and in 1920 the Victor recording company listed 17 yodels in their catalogue, many of them by George Watson, the most successful yodeler of the time. In 1902, Watson recorded the song &quot;Hush-a-bye Baby,&quot; which was later recorded in 1924 by Riley Puckett as &quot;Rock All Our Babies to Sleep,&quot; the first country yodeling record ever made. Earlier, in 1897, Watson had recorded &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot; which Puckett recorded in 1927 as the second-ever country yodeling record. &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot; was also the first song ever recorded by Jimmie Rodgers (at the Bristol sessions in 1928); Rodgers would eventually come to be known as the father of both country music and American yodeling when he combined the yodel with southern African-American blues.
The American minstrel show consisted of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, performed by white people in blackface or, especially after the American Civil War, black people in blackface. Minstrel shows toured the same circuits as opera companies, circuses, and European entertainers, with venues ranging from lavish opera houses to makeshift tavern stages. When the European Tyrolese Minstrels toured the United States for several years in the early 1840s and created an American craze for Alpine yodeling music, four unemployed white actors decided to stage an African-American style spoof of this group&#x27;s concerts. Calling themselves Dan Emmett&#x27;s Virginia Minstrels, the performance was wildly popular and most historians mark this production as the beginning of minstrelsy in the U.S. According to jazz historian Gary Giddins:

Though antebellum (minstrel) troupes were white, the form developed in a form of racial collaboration, illustrating the axiom that defines – and continues to define – American music as it developed over the next century and a half: African American innovations metamorphose into American popular culture when white performers learn to mimic black ones.

===African American roots of the American blue yodel===
By the 1880s, the minstrel show had been replaced by Vaudeville and American Burlesque. By around 1905, more than 20 years before Jimmie Rodgers introduced his blue yodel, African Americans were touring the country singing and yodeling. The most noted yodelers of that time were Monroe Tabor (&quot;The Yodeling Bellboy&quot; - though he was not a bellboy), Beulah Henderson (who appeared in black face), and Charles Anderson (who played a singing &quot;mammy&quot; and a female impersonator in several of his acts). Tabor performed with the Dandy Dixie Minstrels. In New York in 1908, a &#x27;well-known critic&#x27; reported:

Monroe Tabor sang &quot;A Tear, a Kiss, a Smile&quot;. Mr. Tabor is a new tenor with a good voice, which suffers only from a lack of training ... . While there was not quite enough comedy and ragtime, the Yoodle song, &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot;, was greatly in atonement and showed Monroe Tabor to be unexcelled as a yoodler.

And from a 1917 review:

... and Monroe Tabor yodeled as only J.K. Emmett Sr., of yore could do. At the Avenue Theater in December 1917, &quot;When My Ship Comes Sailing Home&quot; was a fine tenor solo by Tabor, who has no superiors as a yodeler.

Known as The Jolly Hendersons, Beulah Henderson toured with her husband Billy from 1905 through 1910. Billed as &quot;The Classy Colored Comedy Pair&quot;, Beulah was featured as &quot;America&#x27;s only Colored Lady Yodeler&quot;. In Indianapolis in 1911 manager Tim Owsley noted:

The Jolly Hendersons offered a clean, bright and snappy act of singing, talking and dancing. Each song rendered by the jolly pair won for them an encore. Mr Henderson is a real clever light comedian, while his partner, Miss Henderson, is just as clever as a singing and talking soubrette. In fact she is one of the first lady yodlers that we have had the pleasure of hearing.

Charles Anderson began touring with a vaudeville show in 1909, singing a combination of blues and yodeling. A 1913 St. Louis review reports:

The Male Mockingbird, Charles Anderson, the man with the golden voice, is some character singer, imitator, and impersonator. As an imitator, Anderson has the best on the market skinned, his violin imitation intermezzo went big, and was one of the best imitations of a musical instrument heard in this neck of the woods for many moons. &quot;Sleep Baby Sleep&quot;, a lullaby sung in costume of an old nurse went big. The yodeling in this song was excellent. &quot;Baby Seals Blues&quot;, as rendered by Anderson, was worth going to hear. After a quick change, Anderson reappeared as the polished gentleman and sang &quot;When the Cuckoo Sings&quot;, instantly winning the hearts of the audience with his perfect yodeling, causing said audience to cheer like mad for more.

Country blues singer Lottie Kimbrough, billed as The Kansas City Butterball (she was a rather large woman), sang in speakeasies and nightclubs. Kimbrough recorded her music from 1924 through 1929 and is now best known for her collaborations with Winston Holmes. Holmes supplied a series of yodels, vocalized bird calls and train whistles on some of their recordings. A good recording of Kimbrough and Holmes singing &quot;Wayward Girl Blues&quot; (1924) is available on YouTube. The similarity to the Jimmie Rodgers Blue Yodels is evident in this Kimbrough recording.

When music critic Abbe Niles heard the Blue Yodel recordings released by Jimmie Rodgers in 1928 &quot;he was impressed by how distinctively black Rodgers&#x27;s Blue Yodel recordings sounded, yodeling and all.&quot; In his opinion Rodgers was a &quot;white man gone black&quot;. In his 1928 record review column, writing under the heading &quot;White man singing black songs,&quot; Niles acknowledged that Rodgers&#x27;s first Blue Yodel had &quot;started the whole epidemic of yodeling blues that now rages – though Clarence Williams wrote a good one five years ago.&quot; Niles went on to advise his readers to add race records to their collections saying, &quot;Listening to race records is nearly the only way for white people to share the Negroes&#x27; pleasures without bothering the Negroes.&quot;

Authors Lynn Abbott &amp; Doug Seroff write:

While some of the blue yodels heard on late 1920s Race recordings – those by the Mississippi Sheiks, for example – probably do owe something to Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; phenomenal success, others – like Billie Young&#x27;s &quot;When They Get Lovin&#x27; They&#x27;s Gone&quot; (accompanied by Jelly Roll Morton on Victor 23339,1930), Lottie Kimbrough and Winston Holmes&#x27; &quot;Lost Lover Blues&quot; (Gennett 6607, 1928), and Clint Jones&#x27; &quot;Mississippi Woman Blues&quot; and &quot;Blue Valley Blues&quot; (Okeh 8587, 1928) – seem more deeply connected to these precedent recordings by Charles Anderson, and to the venerable line of African-American yodelers they represent. There is no reason to doubt that Jimmie Rodgers, who could not resist a show, was exposed to and influenced by the black yodeler-blues singer tradition. Its practitioners were thoroughly entrenched in minstrelsy and vaudeville, and accessible to all races of people. Perhaps Jimmie even saw Charles Anderson himself perform, or heard some of Anderson&#x27;s crystalline blues and yodeling 78s, before rising to immortality on his own great &#x27;Blue Yodel&#x27; recordings. At any rate, the Freeman references strongly suggest that Charles Anderson and his generation of black professional yodelers had introduced the blue yodel in African-American entertainment before Jimmie Rodgers recorded.

Emmett Anthony was another African American vaudeville comedian who yodeled. Along with Charles Anderson of Birmingham, he was one of the premier African American yodelers. He drew praise for his yodeling and comedy in a 1921 revue with Irvin Miller. A 1912 review in the &quot;Indianapolis Freeman&quot; described him as excellent and noted his unique and interesting style.

== Performers ==
=== Early recordings ===
The first musical recordings were made on wax cylinders, simply known as &quot;records&quot; in their era of greatest popularity (1896–1915). These hollow cylindrical objects had an audio recording engraved on the outside surface, which could be reproduced when played on a mechanical cylinder phonograph. Entertainer J.K. Emmet (1841–91) was probably the most well-known yodeler of his time. He did make recordings but died before the recording industry was firmly established. Many future yodelers recorded songs he had either written or made popular, including &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot;. In the 1910s, the competing disc record system triumphed in the marketplace to become the dominant commercial audio medium. 
Most music historians say that the first country music record to include yodeling was &quot;Rock All Our Babies to Sleep&quot; sung by Riley Puckett, a blind singer from Georgia. In 1924 in country music, his recording was one of the top hits of that year. Another early yodeler was Emmett Miller, a minstrel show performer, also from Georgia. In the 1920s, Miller recorded the song &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, which was later a major hit for country singer Hank Williams. Bob Wills, the King of Western Swing, and many others were also influenced by Miller. Miller&#x27;s version of &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; is available on YouTube with a jacket illustration of Miller in blackface.

In the early 1920s, African-American Winston Holmes started a record label, Merritt Records, and was a performer himself. His vocals included bird calls, train whistles and yodels. He managed and made some songs with blues singer Lottie Kimbrough in the twenties. In 1923 and 1924, black performer Charles Anderson recorded eight sides for the Okeh label which gave a summary account of his vaudeville repertoire during the previous decade. Five of the recorded songs are yodels: &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot;, &quot;Comic Yodle Song&quot;, &quot;Coo Coo&quot; (J K Emmett&#x27;s &quot;Cuckoo Song&quot;, adapted for Anderson&#x27;s famous 60 second sustained soprano note), &quot;Laughing Yodel&quot; and &quot;Roll on Silver Moon&quot;, a sentimental ballad, similar to Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; various Southern ballad recordings.

=== Jimmie Rodgers ===
The Singing Brakeman, Jimmie Rodgers, is credited with creating the American version of Alpine yodeling, the blue yodel. While working on the railroad Rogers learned blues techniques from African American gandy dancers (railroad workers), and eventually created his characteristic sound – a blend of traditional work, blues, hobo, and cowboy songs - his trademark &quot;Blue Yodel.&quot; His first blue yodel, known as &quot;Blue Yodel No. 1&quot; (T For Texas), was recorded in the Trinity Baptist Church at Camden, New Jersey. When the song was released in February 1928 it became &quot;a national phenomenon and generated an excitement and record-buying frenzy that no-one could have predicted&quot;.

According to a black musician who lived near Rodgers in Mississippi, everyone, both black and white alike, began to copy Rodgers: &quot;Every one who could pick a guitar started yodeling like Rodgers.&quot; Standing on the Corner (Blue Yodel No. 9), released in 1930, was recorded with Louis Armstrong playing trumpet and Armstrong&#x27;s wife Lil Hardin Armstrong playing the piano. Rodgers died in 1933. Many performers that followed him claimed that he had been a big influence in their singing style and career.

===Cowboy yodelers===
Although today&#x27;s idea of the life and times of cowboys may not be completely accurate, the American cowboy is not a myth. At one time the American West was an open range with thousands of cattle that needed to be watched over, branded, and herded and rounded up and driven to slaughter houses. John Lomax recalls:

I couldn&#x27;t have been more than 4 years old when I first heard a cowboy yodel and sing to his cattle. I was sleeping in my father&#x27;s cabin in Texas. As the cowboys drove the cattle along, they sang, called and yodeled to them. ... They made up songs about trail life.


Music historian Timothy Wise writes that it was the mass media of the time; radio, phonograph, and film, that spread the romantic myth of the cowboy and &quot;popular music was integral to the mass mediation of the idea and of the representation of the cowboy, and yodeling was one of its primary signifiers.&quot; The transformation of Rodgers&#x27; blue yodel to the cowboy yodel involved a change in both rhythm and a move away from Southern blues-type lyrics. Some yodels contained more of the Alpine type of yodel as well. Roy Rogers, singing with the Sons of the Pioneers in 1934, sings to a &quot;sweet Tyrolean maid&quot; in &quot;A Swiss Yodel&quot;.

Jimmie Rodgers was the first to write and sing a cowboy yodel, &quot;The Land of My Boyhood Dreams&quot;, in 1929. At that time he had moved to Texas and a publicity photograph of Rodgers wearing a cowboy outfit appears on one of the recordings he made with the Carter Family. Other country singers, who at that time were called &quot;hillbilly&quot; singers, quickly took on the cowboy image at least in part to escape the negative connotations of the hillbilly label. A Georgia radio station of that era lists &quot;cowboy Roy Lykes&quot;, the &quot;Yodeling Fence Rider&quot; from Texas, in its 1934 roster. Lykes is described as &quot;a real cowboy&quot; who &quot;wears regulation cowboy shoes to get him in the mood&quot;. Many of the old cowboy songs use a beat meant to signify the trot of a lonely cowboy riding his horse on the range.

Without question the most famous singing cowboys are Gene Autry and Roy Rogers the King of the Cowboys. In the 1930s Rogers founded and sang in the group the Sons of the Pioneers &quot;who through well-crafted romantic songs of the American west—often featuring three-part harmonized yodeling—created a new genre in early country music that was quite distinct from that of the so-called hillbillies.&quot;

Canadian Wilf Carter (Montana Slim), known as the &quot;Father of Canadian Country Music,&quot; is a good example of an early cowboy singer. He began singing in the 1920s after seeing a traveling Swiss performer named &quot;The Yodeling Fool&quot; in a nearby town. Carter sang in the &quot;singing cowboy&quot; style and developed a yodel with a Swiss-sound sometimes called an &quot;echo yodel&quot; or a &quot;three-in-one.&quot;

Elton Britt is also considered to be one of the early cowboy yodelers. In 1934, he recorded what was to become his signature song, &quot;Chime Bells.&quot; Like so many others of that era, Britt listened to records of Jimmie Rodgers, which inspired him to learn how to yodel. Eventually, he became renowned for his ability to sustain his yodel for an unusually long time, a skill he reportedly learned while swimming underwater for several minutes at a time.

Jack Guthrie, the cousin of Woody Guthrie, performed in the thirties and early forties. Known as &quot;Oklahoma&#x27;s Yodeling Cowboy&quot;, he developed a style of singing and yodeling influenced by his idol, Jimmie Rodgers, and his experiences as a bucking-horse rider and rodeo performer.

Known as the &quot;Texas Drifter,&quot; Goebel Reeves claimed to have taught Jimmie Rodgers to yodel, which is doubtful. Reeves came from a middle-class background, but chose the life of a hobo. His most famous song, &quot;Hobo&#x27;s Lullaby,&quot; has been covered by numerous singers, notably Woody Guthrie and his son Arlo.

Zeke Clements, known as &quot;The Dixie Yodeler&quot; acted in &quot;singing cowboy&quot; Westerns and also provided the voice of Bashful, the yodeling dwarf, in Walt Disney&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.&quot; Yodeler Hannes Schroll was the voice for the Goofy holler, a stock sound effect that is used frequently in Walt Disney cartoons and films. It is the cry Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, which could be transcribed as &quot;yaaaaaaa-hoo-hoo-hooey!&quot;
&quot;Yodelin&#x27; Slim Clark&quot; hailed from Maine, and performed for 70 years. Yodeler Don Walser was from Texas. Though he was widely known in Texas, his singing career did not really take off until he was 60 years old in 1994. In 2000 he received a lifetime &quot;Heritage&quot; award from the National Endowment for the Arts, and he and his band played at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Jimmie Davis, who served two terms as the Governor of Louisiana, was also a successful country singer who yodeled.

Don Edwards (born in 1939) is a cowboy singer, guitarist and is an accomplished yodeler. He has recorded several albums, two of which, &quot;Saddle Songs&quot; and &quot;Songs of the Cowboy&quot;, are included in the Folklore Archives of the Library of Congress. He was featured on the soundtrack of the 2005 documentary film &quot;Grizzly Man&quot; singing &quot;Coyotes&quot;. The Great American Country network named &quot;Coyotes&quot; as one of their Top 20 Cowboy and Cowgirl Songs; and the members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

Other western music yodeling singers include Douglas B. Green (Ranger Doug) and Wylie Gustafson. Green sings with his band Riders in the Sky. He is also a music historian and has written a book, &quot;Singing in the Saddle,&quot; described as &quot;the first comprehensive look at the singing cowboy phenomenon that swept the United States in the 1930s.&quot; Gustafson learned to yodel from his dad, who learned from Austrians on the ski team in Bozeman, Montana. In 2007, he released an instructional book and CD.

===Cowgirl yodelers===

The DeZurik Sisters were two of the first women to become stars on both the &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; and the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, largely a result of their original yodeling style.

Carolina Cotton and Patsy Montana were also early cowgirl yodeling singers. Carolina Cotton (born Helen Hagstrom, 1925–1997) began to perform while still a youngster. Known as the Yodeling Blonde Bombshell, she went on to appear on radio shows, numerous Western movies, and early television. In the 1940s she sang with the Sons of the Pioneers; the only &quot;daughter&quot; of the group. In the 1950s when Westerns and Western Swing began to fall out of style, she returned to school and earned a master&#x27;s degree in education and began a teaching career.

Patsy Montana (born Ruby Rose Blevins, 1908 - 1996) was the first female country performer to have a million-selling single with her signature song &quot;I Want to Be a Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, recorded in 1935. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. In 2012, her record was added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry list of &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important&quot; American sound recordings.

&quot;Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; was again popularized in 1946 by Rosalie Allen, a &quot;singing cowgirl&quot; from Pennsylvania, who went on to host her own &quot;western&quot; radio show in New York City. Cowboy singer Betty Cody from Maine said she learned how to yodel by listening to Patsy Montana records. She had a hit record &quot;Tom Tom Yodel&quot; in 1952. Margo Smith, known as the Tennessee Yodler, covered it in the 1970s, and Suzy Bogguss released her version in 1988 where it peaked at #77 on the Hot Country Songs. Singer/yodeler LeAnn Rimes again brought the song back in the 1990s. Singing &quot;Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; in 1997, Jessie James Decker won a Louisiana talent contest when she was only nine-years-old and singing the tune in 2006, 11 year-old Taylor Ware was the runner-up on the NBC show &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. She taught herself to yodel and honed her skills by taking lessons from Margo Smith.

In 1996, Rimes also recorded &quot;The Cattle Call&quot;, a &quot;singing cowboy&quot; song written by cowboy yodeler Tex Owens, with legendary singer Eddy Arnold. &quot;The Cattle Call&quot; was Arnold&#x27;s signature song, but it has been recorded by many artists including Emmylou Harris and even Elvis Presley.

=== &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; ===
One famous yodeling tune known the world-over is the song &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;, also known as &quot;Wimoweh&quot;. It was first recorded by Solomon Linda and the Evening Birds in South Africa in 1939. Linda, a singer of Zulu origin, wrote the song, originally titled &quot;Mbube&quot; (), while working for the Gallo Record Company as a cleaner and record packer. According to South African journalist Rian Malan:

&quot;Mbube&quot; wasn&#x27;t the most remarkable tune, but there was something terribly compelling about the underlying chant, a dense meshing of low male voices above which Solomon yodeled and howled for two exhilarating minutes, occasionally making it up as he went along. The third take was the great one, but it achieved immortality only in its dying seconds, when Solly took a deep breath, opened his mouth and improvised the melody that the world now associates with these words:
::&quot;In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight&quot;.

By 1948, the song had sold about 100,000 copies in Africa and among black South African immigrants in the United Kingdom and had lent its name to a style of African a cappella music that evolved into &quot;isicathamiya&quot; (also called &quot;mbube&quot;), popularized by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. It was covered internationally by many 1950s pop and folk revival artists, including The Weavers, Jimmy Dorsey, Yma Sumac, Miriam Makeba, and The Kingston Trio. In 1961, it became a number one hit in the U.S. as adapted by the doo-wop group The Tokens and in 1982 as a number one hit in the UK for Tight Fit. It went on to earn at least 15 million US dollars in royalties from covers and film licensing. Then, in the mid-1990s, it became a pop &quot;supernova&quot; when it was used in the film &quot;The Lion King&quot;, its spin-off TV series and live musical.

=== The Tarzan yell ===
The Tarzan yell is the yodel-like call of the character Tarzan, as portrayed by actor Johnny Weissmuller in the films based on the character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, starting with &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; (1932). The yell was a creation of the movies, based on what Burroughs described in his books as &quot;the victory cry of the bull ape.&quot; Carol Burnett has been associated with the Tarzan yell ever since doing it on her TV show that started in 1967 and ran for 11 years. This link from the Larry King Now show describes how she came to do it Carol Burnett on how the Tarzan yell started.

=== Radio ===

Other than the National Barn Dance, broadcast out of Chicago starting in 1924, and the Grand Ole Opry in 1925, American Country Western performers had only live performances and records to promote their music. When radio grew in popularity in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the powerful recording company RCA Victor feared that free music would devastate their record business. RCA first attempted to prevent artists from appearing on the radio and then successfully stopped the growth of more powerful FM stations. But radio ownership grew from two out of five U.S. homes in 1931 to four out of five homes in 1938, and stations began to broadcast live shows featuring various artists, sometimes with a live audience. Some artists remained in their home area, but many traveled a circuit covering dozens of low-power AM stations throughout the country, introducing the various styles of singing to others outside of their region.

== Notable performers ==
=== United States ===
Jimmie Davis was a singer and songwriter, and served two terms as the governor of Louisiana. Singing on a local radio station, his early work was in the style of country music singer Jimmie Rodgers. Like Rodgers, he was influenced by African-American blues music and discovering its rich use of sexual double meanings, he wrote some of his own tunes such as &quot;Tom Cat and Pussy Blues&quot; and &quot;Organ Grinder Blues&quot;. In his first run for governor his opponent tried to use some of his old work against him by playing it at a rally, but instead the crowds cheered for it and began dancing. On a week-end fishing trip, he and Hank Williams composed the Williams recording titled &quot;(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle&quot;.

Blue yodeler Cliff Carlisle was one of the most prolific recording artists of the 1930s, and a pioneer in the use of the Hawaiian steel guitar in country music. He frequently released songs with sexual connotations including barnyard metaphors (which became something of a trademark).

Hank Snow was one of the great country legends of the 1950s, but he had actually been singing in Canada for years where he was known as &quot;The Yodeling Ranger&quot;. He admired Jimmie Rodgers as well, and learned to yodel by listening to his records. He even named his son Jimmie Rodgers Snow.

Tommy Duncan, vocalist for &quot;Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys&quot;, was a good yodeler. (See the sound file with Duncan singing Rodger&#x27;s &quot;Blue Yodel No. 1&quot; in 1937) Bob Wills is considered by music authorities to be the co-founder of Western Swing.

In 1949, Hank Williams recorded his first hit song &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, first recorded by Emmett Miller in 1928. Williams was familiar with Miller&#x27;s recording and first performed his version, replacing the jazz musicians with his own country music band but retaining Miller&#x27;s yodel, in an appearance on The Louisiana Hayride. His recording became an overnight success, quickly reaching number one on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; music charts. Singer Patsy Cline could yodel. She released her version of &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; in 1960.

Perhaps yodeler Bill Haley, of &quot;Bill Haley and the Comets,&quot; has one of the strangest histories of all. Haley zoomed to fame as the &quot;King of Rock and Roll&quot; when his song &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was featured in the popular film &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; in 1955, but it was little known that Haley and his band had been touring for years, performing Western swing music with Haley featured as a yodeler. Haley had been born in 1925, and in 1955, when &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; initially charted, he and his band were using the name the Comets. However, prior to that time they had gone under the names the &quot;Down Homers,&quot; the &quot;Texas Range Riders,&quot; the &quot;Four Aces of Western Swing,&quot; and finally, &quot;The Saddlemen.&quot; At one point in the 1940s, Haley was even awarded Indiana State Yodeling Champion for his skill; this might have been a fact that his skillful manager, Colonel Tom Parker, felt not important to mention to his screaming teenage rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll fans.

Yodeler Kenny Roberts was another member of the &quot;Down Homers;&quot; he had taught Bill Haley to yodel before he did a stint in the Navy when Haley took his place in the band. In later years Roberts was popular on children&#x27;s TV shows where he used to leap over two feet in the air while playing guitar and yodeling.

Otis Dewey &quot;Slim&quot; Whitman performed for over 60 years. Whitman avoided the &quot;down on yer luck&quot; songs, preferring instead to sing laid-back romantic melodies about simple life and love. Critics dubbed his musical style &quot;countrypolitan,&quot; due to its fusion of country music and a more sophisticated crooner vocal style. Pop singer Michael Jackson cited Whitman as one of his ten favorite vocalists. Beatles George Harrison and Paul McCartney cite Whitman as an early influence In the film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, a Kansas teenager discovers that the Martians are vulnerable to Whitman&#x27;s song &quot;Indian Love Call,&quot; whereupon he and his grandmother use it to destroy the Martians.

Janet McBride grew up in Maine where she began to yodel while still a child. She continued to sing and record, writing some of her own music, for over 40 years. She has toured in the U.S. and in Austria. McBride was awarded Western Music Association&#x27;s Female Yodeler of the Year in 1991.

Swiss-American folk and country singer Jewel Kilcher yodels, and is known for her version of &quot;Chime Bells&quot;. Jewel says that she learned to yodel from her father, Attila Kuno &quot;Atz&quot; Kilcher, who himself also learned to yodel by listening to Jimmie Rodgers.

Mike Johnson is an African American yodeler who combines the Jimmie Rodgers, Swiss, and Cowboy yodeling styles. In 2007, 114 of his yodeling songs were inducted into the Recorded Sound Reference Center&#x27;s permanent music collection in the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.

Jazz singer Leon Thomas, best known for his work with Pharoah Sanders, particularly the 1969 song &quot;The Creator Has a Master Plan&quot; from Sanders&#x27;s &quot;Karma&quot; album, was known to break out into yodeling in the middle of a vocal. Thomas said he learned to yodel from listening to African Pygmy singers. This style has influenced singers James Moody, Tim Buckley and Bobby McFerrin, among others.

Kerry Christensen, who hails from Idaho, has been performing since he was three years old. He yodels in both western and Alpine styles and also plays the accordion, the zither, and the alphorn ... and is very good at imitating chickens.

Yodeler Taylor Ware was a contestant on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; when she was eleven years old. According to Ware, she taught herself to yodel from an audiotape and instruction book when she was seven years old. Alyse Eady, who holds the title of Miss Arkansas 2010 and was 1st runner-up in the Miss America 2011 Pageant, both yodeled and did ventriloquism in the song &quot;I Want to Be a Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; as her talent performance.

According to Bart Plantenga, author of &quot;Yodel-Ay-Ee-Oooo: The Secret History of Yodeling Around the World,&quot; &quot;... unlikely yodellers include the Muppets (with, of course, special guest Julie Andrews), Shakira, Goofy, Bill Murray (remember &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels?&quot;), Gene Wilder (who was taught to yodel by Rough Guide contributor and yodel legend Kenny Roberts), and South Korea&#x27;s former Miss World Ji-Yea Park.&quot;

&quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, one of Rodgers&#x27;s and Hammerstein&#x27;s best-known collaborations, contains a yodelling song, &quot;The Lonely Goatherd,&quot; in which Mary Martin yodelled to good effect in the original production on Broadway in 1959. Julie Andrews was similarly effective in the 1965 film version, with the same song. Gwen Stefani also yodeled in the 2006 single &quot;Wind It Up&quot;. The lead vocalist for American electro-punk band the Epoxies is also known for her yodeling in a lot of their songs. Soul singer Aaron Neville said he was inspired by Gene Autry&#x27;s yodelling to develop his unusual vibrato singing style.

In a sketch that aired on the TV &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,&quot; the actor Brad Pitt and Jimmy Fallon engaged in a yodeling conversation atop New York City skyscrapers. As they yodeled back and forth, subtitles inform viewers of what they are saying to each another. After some small talk, Pitt asks Fallon if he&#x27;d like to try a &quot;double yodel.&quot; Fallon responds, &quot;A double yodel? But that&#x27;s never been done before!&quot; The episode concludes with the two yodeling in harmony.

In April 2018, eleven-year-old Mason Ramsey, from Golconda, Illinois, was caught on camera yodeling the Hank Williams hit &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; in a Walmart store. Within a few days, videos of his performance collectively garnered over 25 million views and he became a viral sensation and Internet meme. Ramsey&#x27;s performance sparked new interest in Hank Williams 70 year-old recording of the song and, in March, Rolling Stone reported that Spotify&#x27;s Viral 50 chart for the U.S. ranked Hank William&#x27;s &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; at Number Three, and Number Four around the globe. The Wikipedia views of their &quot;Yodeling&quot; article jumped from a few hundred to over 5,000 a day. As a result of his newfound fame Ramsey made an appearance on the &quot; Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;. Saying that his dream was to appear on Grand Ole Opry one day, DeGeneres surprised Ramsey by saying he had been booked for the following weekend.

=== Canada ===
Canadian country singer and yodeler Donn Reynolds set a world record yodelling non-stop for 7 hours and 29 minutes in 1976. Reynolds later established a world record for the fastest 5 tone yodel (3 falsetto) in 1.9 seconds in 1984. His release of the yodelling song &quot;She Taught Me How To Yodel&quot; reached #2 on the Canadian country music charts in 1965.

Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors of Canada is also noted for yodeling in some of his songs.

Rod Erickson born in Beaverlodge, Alberta is also a well known yodeller. His first release after signing with MGM was &quot;She Taught Me How To Yodel&quot; which reached the top ten worldwide within a month. The only yodel song to ever go top ten worldwide. Some of Erickson&#x27;s other chart toppers include &quot;Yodel Sweet Molly&quot;, &quot;Cannonball Yodel&quot; and &quot;Cattle Call.&quot; In 1976 his song &quot;Going Home&quot; went top in Canada, a first for a country song in Canada.

=== Europe ===
Yodeling is a major feature of folk music (Volksmusik) from Switzerland, Austria, and southern Germany and can be heard in many contemporary folk songs, which are also featured on regular TV broadcasts. Stefanie Hertel is a German yodeler and popular performer of Alpine folk music. Hertel has won numerous prizes as a performer; in 1992, she won the Grand Prix der Volksmusik with the song &quot;Über jedes Bacherl geht a Brückerl&quot;.

Franz &quot;Franzl&quot; Lang, known as the Yodelking (German: Jodlerkönig), was a famous yodeler from Bavaria. Lang also played the guitar and the accordion and he authored several books on yodeling. Ursprung Buam is an Austrian folk music trio from Zillertal, Tyrol. One of the most popular touring groups in Austria, Ursprung Buam often tours Germany and many places across the European Union, as well as the Tirolean festival scene. Oesch’s die Dritten is a Yodel Volksmusik family group from the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland.

Bobbejaan Schoepen was an extremely accomplished, successful, and versatile Belgian entertainer, entrepreneur, singer-songwriter, guitarist, comedian, actor, and professional whistler. In 1948, &quot;De Jodelende Fluiter&quot; (&quot;The Yodeling Whistler&quot;) was Schoepen&#x27;s first hit. In 1953, he was one of the first Europeans to appear at the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in the United States. Outside of regional &quot;Volksmusic&quot;, Karl Denver was a Scottish singer who had a series of yodel-based hit singles in the early 1960s. Most famous of these was a 1961 version of &quot;Wimoweh&quot;.

Harry Hopkinson (1902–1979) has been credited as one of the world&#x27;s greatest yodelers. He used the stage name Harry Torrani and was billed as the &quot;Yodeling Cowboy from Chesterfield&quot;. Frank Ifield, an Australian-English singer, released a double A-sided single record, &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; and &quot;She Taught Me How to Yodel&quot; in the UK in 1962. It reached number 1 in the UK charts, and also reached number 44 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.

In England, Edith Sitwell featured a &quot;Jodelling Song&quot; as part of her series of poems &quot;Façade&quot;, set to music by William Walton.

One of the earliest songs to portray an unusual marriage between yodeling and rock music was &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; by the Dutch band Focus released in 1971.

Irish singer Dolores O&#x27;Riordan was renowned for her &quot;natural&quot; Celtic yodeling particularly in tracks such as &quot;Dreams&quot;, one of several O&#x27;Riordan-penned singles from the five-times RIAA certified platinum album, &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot; by the Cranberries. It can also be heard on most of O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s songs, especially on &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be with You&quot;, and &quot;Zombie&quot;, the lead single from the seven-times RIAA certified platinum album, &quot;No Need to Argue&quot;. O&#x27;Riordan continued to incorporate her trademark yodeling in works throughout her career, as in the song &quot;Black Widow&quot; which appears on her solo album &quot;Are You Listening?&quot;. Author Bart Plantenga wrote, &quot;Dolores O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s voice is truly unique, to the point that, as with throat singers, you want to dissect her throat to inspect the physiological source of her enchanting yet discomfiting yodel-inflected vocals&quot;.

The song &quot;Yodel It!&quot; from Ilinca Băcilă and Alex Florea represented Romania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, reaching seventh place. The track musically portrays a mixture between yodeling, rap, rock, pop and hip hop music, featuring Ilinca yodeling through the chorus. &quot;Yodel It!&quot; was originally thought for Swiss band Timebelle, but was then handed to Ilinca to record; Florea was ultimately chosen as a featuring artist for a better quality.

In Spain, the band El Pony Pisador uses yodel mixed with Irish music and bluegrass to create new sonorities.

=== Outside Europe and North America ===
Australia&#x27;s first singing cowboy, Smoky Dawson, was well known for his western-style yodel and featured yodel on his first single, &quot;I&#x27;m A Happy Go-Lucky Cowhand&quot;. In South Africa, yodeling is featured in some Afrikaans-language pop music.

<text>Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and encourage its recitation in public schools, due to violation of the First Amendment. The ruling has been the subject of intense debate.

The prayer was twenty-two words that went as follows:
The Herricks Union Free School District adopted the proposal in July 1958. Students could opt-out with a parent&#x27;s signature. Five parents of public school students attending Herricks High School in New Hyde Park sued the school board president William J. Vitale Jr., challenging the constitutionality of the Regents&#x27; Prayer. Two of the plaintiffs were Jewish, one was an atheist, one was a Unitarian church member, and one was a member of the New York Society for Ethical Culture. Steven I. Engel, a Jewish man, became the lead plaintiff.
The plaintiffs argued that opening the school day with such a prayer violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The governments of twenty-two states submitted an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief to the Supreme Court urging affirmance of the New York Court of Appeals decision which upheld the constitutionality of the prayer. The American Jewish Committee, the Synagogue Council of America, and the American Ethical Union each submitted briefs urging the Court to instead reverse and rule that the prayer was unconstitutional.

==Lower court history==

Bernard S. Meyer wrote the trial court opinion ruling that the Establishment Clause &quot;does not prohibit the non-compulsory saying of the Regents&#x27; prayer in the public schools&quot;. Meyer&#x27;s reasoning was based on the &quot;accepted practice&quot; at the time the amendments were adopted:

The reason the &#x27;establishment&#x27; clause is not breached is ... because traditionally, and particularly at the time of the adoption of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, this was the accepted practice.

Aside from the historical analysis, the trial court relied on the Supreme Court precedent in &quot;Zorach v. Clauson&quot;:

The &quot;Zorach&quot; case holds that the Constitution does not require separation in every and all respects and, as we have seen, constitutional history confirms a tradition of prayer, including prayer in the schools...the instant prayer, at least when its recitation is limited to daily exercises at the opening of school, must be classified as outside &quot;McCollum&#x27;s&quot; proscription of religious instruction and within &quot;Zorach&#x27;s&quot; sanction as an accommodation.

The Appellate Division for the Second Department affirmed the trial court&#x27;s judgment in a &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion. George Beldock wrote a separate opinion, concurring in part, and dissenting in part. Beldock did not agree that the case should be decided based on morning prayer at public schools being an &quot;accepted practice&quot; at the time the amendments were adopted. Citing &quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot;, supported by additional reasoning in &quot;Zorach v. Clauson&quot;, Beldock argued that the Regents&#x27; Prayer merely reaffirmed &quot;that this is a religious nation&quot;. He said the Establishment Clause was not violated because &quot;an accommodation of secular education to the voluntary prayer or confession of religious faith&quot; was not a religious teaching or instruction.

On further appeal, the divided New York Court of Appeals agreed with the lower state courts that the Regents&#x27; prayer could be read in public schools without violating the Establishment Clause as long as student participation was voluntary. The courts said the prayer was constitutional because of the opt-out provision.

==Supreme Court of the United States==
In a 6–1 decision (Justices Felix Frankfurter and Byron White did not participate), the Supreme Court held that reciting government-written prayers in public schools was unconstitutional, violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

===Majority opinion===

Writing for the majority, Justice Hugo Black wrote that recitation of a government-written prayer by school children was &quot;a practice wholly inconsistent with the Establishment Clause&quot; that breached the &quot;wall of separation between Church and State&quot;. Even though the prayer is &quot;non-denominational&quot; and voluntary the Court found there was indirect coercion of religious minorities: &quot;When the power, prestige and financial support of government is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain.&quot;

Justice Black&#x27;s reasoning included historical analysis:

It is a matter of history that this practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America.

Justice Black&#x27;s argument that religion is &quot;too personal, too sacred, too holy to permit its &#x27;unhallowed perversion&#x27; by a civil magistrate&quot; includes a direct quote from James Madison&#x27;s Memorial and Remonstrance.

===Douglas concurrence===
In a concurring opinion, Justice Douglas argued that the Establishment Clause is also violated when the government grants financial aid to religious schools. He argued that the First Amendment requires the government to be neutral in religious matters:

The philosophy is that the atheist or agnostic—the non-believer—is entitled to go his own way. The philosophy is that if government interferes in matters spiritual, it will be a divisive force.

The concurrence was highly criticized. Douglas argued that all religious exercise in public settings was unconstitutional, foreshadowing the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Abington v. Schempp&quot; the following year which took a neutrality view of Establishment: &quot;In the relationship between man and religion, the State is firmly committed to a position of neutrality&quot;.

===Stewart dissent===
In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stewart contended that the Establishment Clause was originally written to abolish the idea of a state-sponsored church, and not to stop a non-mandatory &quot;brief non-denominational prayer&quot;.

==Reactions==
The negative reaction of Congress was overwhelming. Only John Lindsay and Emanuel Celler supported the decision. Frank J. Becker called it &quot;the most tragic decision in the history of the United States&quot; and introduced a proposed constitutional amendment to allow religious exercises in public schools. There was already a lot of anger towards the Warren Court, especially among white Protestants in the South and Midwest, for its school desegregation decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. After the &quot;Engel&quot; decision, some members of Congress, like George Andrews of Alabama and James Eastland of Mississippi, made references to both desegregation and prayer in schools in their attacks on the Warren Court.

&quot;The Christian Century&quot; was critical of the southern politicians who opposed the ruling, accusing them of weaponizing the school prayer controversy &quot;to whip the court for its desegregation of public schools&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Anthony Lewis wrote that politicians were trying to show &quot;how equally wrong the Court had been to outlaw segregation&quot;.

The Senate Judiciary Committee headed by James Eastland held hearings on five measures to overturn the &quot;Engel&quot; decision. Bishop James Pike, a prominent religious moderate and lawyer, opposed the Court&#x27;s broad interpretation of the Establishment Clause because it prohibited non-denominational prayer. He testified in support of a constitutional amendment that would limit the establishment of religion to &quot;the recognition as an Established Church or any denomination, sect, or organized religious association&quot;.

While internal debate continued within the Jewish community about the role of religion in the public square, the American Jewish Congress called the case &quot;a great milestone&quot;, and the decision was celebrated by most American Jewish groups.

Catholic clergy expressed strong disapproval of the decision. Cardinal Spellman said: &quot;The decision strikes at the very heart of the Godly tradition in which America&#x27;s children have for so long been raised.&quot; Led by John J. Rooney of New York, support among Catholics increased for federal funding for parochial schools.

The National Association of Evangelicals, the National Council of Churches and &quot;The Christian Century&quot; opposed proposals to overturn &quot;Engel&quot; by amendment. Supportive of the decision, &quot;The Christian Century&quot; noted that &quot;Engel&quot; had not decided the question of prayer in public schools because its holding was limited to a government-drafted prayer. Justice Clark&#x27;s public statements distancing the majority opinion from Douglas&#x27; concurrence initially gave supporters of school prayer some hope that the Court would decline to issue a broad ruling in upcoming school prayer cases, but recitation of The Lord&#x27;s Prayer in public school was ruled unconstitutional in &quot;Schempp&quot; the following year.

==Subsequent developments==

&quot;Engel&quot; has been the basis for several subsequent decisions limiting government-directed prayer in school. In &quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot; (1985), the Supreme Court ruled Alabama&#x27;s law permitting one minute for prayer or meditation was unconstitutional. In &quot;Lee v. Weisman&quot; (1992), the court prohibited clergy-led prayer at middle school graduation ceremonies. &quot;Lee v. Weisman&quot;, in turn, was a basis for &quot;Santa Fe ISD v. Doe&quot; (2000), in which the Court extended the ban to school-organized &quot;student&quot;-led prayer at high school football games in which a majority of students voted in favor of the prayer.

A year after the 1962 &quot;Engel&quot; ruling, the Court decided in &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot; that recitation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and Bible reading in school were unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause.

<doc id="308726" wikidata="Q1431121" url="?curid=308726" title="St Michael's Mount">
<text>St Michael&#x27;s Mount (, meaning &quot;hoar rock in woodland&quot;) is a tidal island in Mount&#x27;s Bay near Penzance, Cornwall, England (United Kingdom). The island is a civil parish and is linked to the town of Marazion by a causeway of granite setts, passable (as is the beach) between mid-tide and low water. It is managed by the National Trust, and the castle and chapel have been the home of the St Aubyn family since around 1650.

Historically, St Michael&#x27;s Mount was an English counterpart of Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy, France, which is also a tidal island, and has a similar conical shape, though Mont-Saint-Michel is much taller.

St Michael&#x27;s Mount is one of 43 unbridged tidal islands accessible by foot from mainland Britain. Part of the island was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1995 for its geology. Sea height can vary by up to around between low and high tide.

== Etymology ==
Its Cornish language name—literally, &quot;the grey rock in a wood&quot;—may represent a folk memory of a time before Mount&#x27;s Bay was flooded, indicating a description of the mount set in woodland. Remains of ancient trees uncovered by storms have been seen at low tides in Mount&#x27;s Bay.

==Prehistory==
There is evidence of people living in the area during the Neolithic between around 4000 and 2500 BC. The key discovery was of a leaf-shaped flint arrowhead in a shallow pit on the lower eastern slope, now part of the gardens. Other pieces of flint have been found, and at least two could be Mesolithic (about 8000 to 4000 BC). During the early Mesolithic, Britain was still attached to mainland Europe across the southern North Sea between Kent and East Yorkshire (see Doggerland) but by the Neolithic, because of rising sea level, had become an island. Archaeologist and prehistorian Caroline Malone has noted that during the Late Mesolithic the British Isles were something of a &quot;technological backwater&quot; in European terms, still living as a hunter-gatherer society whilst most of southern Europe had already taken up agriculture and sedentary living. The mount was then probably an area of dry ground surrounded by a marshy forest. Any Neolithic or Mesolithic camps are likely to have been destroyed by the later extensive building operations, but it is reasonable to expect the mount to have supported a seasonal or short-term camp.

None of the flints so far recovered can be positively dated to the Bronze Age (c. 2500 to 800 BC), although any summit cairns would have most likely been destroyed when building the castle. Radiocarbon dating established the submerging of the hazel wood at about 1700 BC. A hoard of copper weapons, once thought to have been found on the mount, are now thought to have been found on nearby Marazion Marsh. Defensive stony banks on the north-eastern slopes are likely to date to the early 1st millennium BC, and are considered to be a cliff castle. The mount is one of several candidates for the island of Ictis, described as a tin trading centre in the &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; of the Sicilian-Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the first century BC.

==History==
St Michael&#x27;s Mount may have been the site of a monastery from the 8th to the early 11th centuries. Edward the Confessor gave the site to the Benedictine order of Mont-Saint-Michel and it was a priory of that abbey until the dissolution of the alien houses as a side-effect of the war in France by Henry V. Subsequently, it ceased to be a priory, but was reduced to being a secular chapel which was given to the Abbess and Convent of Syon at Isleworth, Middlesex, in 1424. Thus ended its association with Mont-Saint-Michel, and any connection with Looe Island (dedicated to the Archangel Michael). It was a destination for pilgrims, whose devotions were encouraged by an indulgence granted by Pope Gregory VII in the 11th century. The earliest buildings on the summit, including a castle, date to the 12th century.

===Siege, occupation and ownership===
Sir Henry de la Pomeroy captured the Mount in 1193, on behalf of Prince John, in the reign of Richard I, the leader of the previous occupants having &#x27;died of fright&#x27; upon learning rumours of Richard&#x27;s release from captivity. The monastic buildings were built during the 12th century. Various sources state that the earthquake of 1275 destroyed the original Priory church, although this may be a misunderstanding of the term &quot;St Michael&#x27;s on the Mount&quot; which referred to the church of St Michael atop Glastonbury Tor. Syon Abbey, a monastery of the Bridgettine Order, acquired the Mount in 1424. Some 20 years later the Mount was granted by Henry VI to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge on its foundation. However, when Edward IV took the throne during the Wars of the Roses, the Mount was returned to the Syon Abbey in 1462.

John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, seized and held it during a siege of 23 weeks against 6,000 of Edward IV&#x27;s troops in 1473–1474. Perkin Warbeck, a pretender to the English throne, occupied the Mount in 1497. Sir Humphrey Arundell, Governor of St Michael&#x27;s Mount, led the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549. During the reign of Elizabeth I, it was given to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, by whose son it was sold to Sir Francis Bassett. During the Civil War, Sir Arthur Bassett, brother of Sir Francis, held the Mount against the Parliament until July 1646.

The Mount was sold in 1659 to Colonel John St Aubyn. , his descendants, the Lords St Levan, remain seated at St Michael&#x27;s Mount.

===18th century===
Little is known about the village before the beginning of the 18th century, save that there were a few fishermen&#x27;s cottages and monastic cottages. After improvements to the harbour in 1727, St Michael&#x27;s Mount became a flourishing seaport.

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused a tsunami to strike the Cornish coast over away. The sea rose in 10 minutes at St Michael&#x27;s Mount, ebbed at the same rate, and continued to rise and fall for five hours. The 19th-century French writer Arnold Boscowitz claimed that &quot;great loss of life and property occurred upon the coasts of Cornwall.&quot;

===19th century===
By 1811, there were 53 houses and four streets. The pier was extended in 1821 and the population peaked in the same year, when the island had 221 people. There were three schools, a Wesleyan chapel, and three public houses, mostly used by visiting sailors. Following major improvements to nearby Penzance harbour, and the extension of the railway to Penzance in 1852, the village went into decline, and many of the houses and other buildings were demolished.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the structure of the castle was romanticised. In the late 19th century, the remains of an anchorite were discovered in a tomb within the domestic chapel.
A short, underground narrow gauge railway was constructed in about 1900. It was used to bring goods up to the castle and take away rubbish. In 2018, the tramway was reported as being &quot;still in regular use, perhaps not every day&quot;, and is not open to the general public, although a small stretch is visible at the harbour. It is Britain&#x27;s last functionally operational railway.

Some sources, including in the British industrial narrow gauge railways, a list of track gauges and, in 2018, on an information board near the line, suggest a different gauge of while &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot; says it has a gauge of .

===Second World War===
The Mount was fortified in World War II, during the invasion crisis of 1940–1941. Three pillboxes can be seen to this day. After the war, the decommissioned battleship was beached near the mount, and was scrapped in place after attempts to refloat the wreck failed.

Sixty-five years after the Second World War, it was suggested based on interviews with contemporaries that the former Nazi Foreign Minister and one-time ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, had intended to live at the mount after the planned German conquest. Archived documents revealed that during his time in Britain in the 1930s, when he had proposed an alliance with Nazi Germany, von Ribbentrop frequently visited Cornwall.

===National Trust===
In 1954, Francis Cecil St Aubyn, 3rd Baron St Levan, gave most of St Michael&#x27;s Mount to the National Trust, together with a large endowment fund. The St Aubyn family retained a 999-year lease to inhabit the castle and a licence to manage the public viewing of its historic rooms, managed in conjunction with the National Trust.

==Priors and owners of St Michael&#x27;s Mount==


==Preservation==

The chapel of St Michael, a 15th-century building, has an embattled tower, one angle of which is a small turret, which served for the guidance of ships. The chapel is extra-diocesan and continues to serve the Order of St John by permission of Lord St Levan. Chapel Rock, on the beach, marks the site of a shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary, where pilgrims paused to worship before ascending the mount. Many antiquities, comprising plate armour, paintings and furniture, are preserved at the castle. Several houses are built on the hillside facing Marazion, and a spring provides a natural flow of water. There is a row of eight houses at the back of the present village; built in 1885, they are known as Elizabeth Terrace. Some of the houses are occupied by staff working in the castle and elsewhere on the island. The mount&#x27;s cemetery (currently no public access) contains the graves of former residents of the island and several drowned sailors. There are also buildings that were formerly the steward&#x27;s house, a changing-room for bathers, the stables, the laundry, a barge house, a sail loft (now a restaurant), and two former inns. A former bowling green adjoins one of the buildings. The population of this parish in 2011 was 35.

The harbour, enlarged in 1823 to accommodate vessels of up to 500 tonnes deadweight, has a pier dating back to the 15th century which has also been renovated. Queen Victoria disembarked from the royal yacht at St Michael&#x27;s Mount in 1846, and a brass inlay of her footstep can be seen at the top of the landing stage. King Edward VII&#x27;s footstep is also visible near the bowling green. In 1967 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother entered the harbour in a pinnace from the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;.

The island underground railway is used to transport goods from the harbour to the castle. It was built by miners around 1900, replacing the pack horses which had previously been used. Its steep gradient renders it unsafe for passenger use; thus the National Trust has made it out-of-bounds for public access.

The causeway between the mount and Marazion was improved in 1879 by raising it by with sand and stones from the surrounding area. Repairs were completed in March 2016 following damage from the 2014 winter storms. Some studies indicate that any rise in ocean waters as well as existing natural erosion would put some of the Cornwall coast at risk, including St Michael&#x27;s Mount.

===Local government===

Until recent times, both the mount and the town of Marazion formed part of the parish of St Hilary. St Michael&#x27;s Mount forms its own civil parish for local government purposes. Currently, this takes the form of a parish meeting as opposed to a parish council (that is, a yearly meeting of electors that does not elect councillors). Lord St Levan currently chairs the St Michael&#x27;s Mount parish meeting.

==Geology==
The rock exposures around St Michael&#x27;s Mount provide an opportunity to see many features of the geology of Cornwall in a single locality. The mount is made of the uppermost part of a granite intrusion into metamorphosed Devonian mudstones or pelites. The granite is itself mineralised with a well-developed sheeted greisen vein system. Due to its geology, the island&#x27;s seaward side has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1995.

===Granites===
There are two types of granite visible on the mount. Most of the intrusion is a tourmaline muscovite granite which is variably porphyritic. This is separated from a biotite muscovite granite by pegmatites.

===Devonian pelites===
Originally laid down as mudstones these pelites were regionally metamorphosed and deformed (mainly folded here) by the Variscan orogeny. They were then affected by the intrusion of the granite, which caused further contact metamorphism, locally forming a hornfels, and tin mineralisation.

===Mineralisation===
The best developed mineralisation is found within the uppermost part of the granite itself in the form of sheeted greisen veins. These steep W-E trending veins are thought to have formed by hydraulic fracturing, when the fluid pressure at the top of the granite reached a critical level. The granite was fractured and the fluids altered the granite by replacing feldspars with quartz and muscovite. The fluids were also rich in boron, tin and tungsten, and tourmaline, wolframite and cassiterite are common in the greisen veins. As the area cooled, the veins became open to fluids from the surrounding country rock and these deposited sulphides, e.g. chalcopyrite and stannite. Greisen veins are also locally developed within the pelites.

==Folklore==
In prehistoric times, St Michael&#x27;s Mount may have been a port for the tin trade, and Gavin de Beer made a case for it to be identified with the &quot;tin port&quot; Ictis/Ictin mentioned by Posidonius.

There are popular claims of a tradition that the Archangel Michael appeared before local fishermen on the mount in the 5th century AD. But in fact this is a modern myth. The earliest appearance of it is in a version by John Mirk, copying details of the medieval legend for Mont-Saint-Michel from the Golden Legend. The folk-story was examined and found to be based on a 15th-century misunderstanding by Max Muller.

The chronicler John of Worcester relates under the year 1099, that St Michael&#x27;s Mount was located five or six miles (10 km) from the sea, enclosed in a thick wood, but that on the third day of November the sea overflowed the land, destroying many towns and drowned many people as well as innumerable oxen and sheep; the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records under the date 11 November 1099, &quot;The sea-flood sprung up to such a height, and did so much harm, as no man remembered that it ever did before&quot;. The Cornish legend of Lyonesse, an ancient kingdom said to have extended from Penwith toward the Isles of Scilly, also talks of land being inundated by the sea.

One of the earliest references to the mount (originally named &quot;Dynsol&quot; or &quot;Dinsul&quot;), was in the mid 11th century when it was &quot;Sanctus Michael beside the sea&quot;.

In the 1600s, John Milton used the Mount as the setting for the finale of what was once one of the most famous poems in English literature, his &quot;Lycidas&quot;, which drew on the traditional sea-lore that had it that the archangel Michael sat in a great stone chair at the top of the Mount, seeing far over the sea and thus protecting England. In the mid-1850s the poem&#x27;s scenes of the drowning of Lycidas, in the seas below the Mount, were illustrated in engravings and paintings by J. M. W. Turner. The poem drew together various traditions from the Bible, classical mythology and local folklore to offer an elegy for the pagan world that had faded away.

==Legend==

According to legend, the island was once home to a giant named Cormoran, who lived on the Mount and stole livestock from local farmers. A reward was offered to stop Cormoran and a boy named Jack put himself forward, killing Cormoran by trapping him in a concealed pit and burying him there. When he returned home, the elders in the village gave him a hero&#x27;s welcome, and henceforth, called him &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;.

==In modern popular culture==
The mount has featured in a number of films, including the 1979 film &quot;Dracula&quot;, where it was prominently featured as the exterior of Castle Dracula. 

* It appeared in the 1983 James Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, as two air-launched cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads fly over the English countryside and out to sea, passing directly over St Michael&#x27;s Mount. 
* In the 2003 film &quot;Johnny English,&quot; it was used as the exterior of the character Pascal Sauvage&#x27;s French château.
* In 2006 Simon Armitage published a poem &quot;Causeway&quot; in &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex Versus The Corduroy Kid&quot; dealing with a family visit to St Michael&#x27;s Mount.
* In 2012 it was a filming location for the fantasy adventure film &quot;Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box&quot;.
* In 2021 it was used for the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; prequel series &quot;House of the Dragon&quot;.
* &quot;Mt Saint Michel + Saint Michaels Mount&quot; is the title of a song on the album &quot;drukQs&quot; by musician Aphex Twin.
* It was one of the locations used for BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Balloon&quot; idents which were used from Autumn 1998 to 2002.
* Under its Cornish name of Karrek Loos yn Koos, the island appears prominently in Giles Kristian&#x27;s 2018 historical fiction novel &quot;Lancelot&quot;.
* St Michael&#x27;s Mount is the setting for &quot;The Dead of Winter,&quot; a murder mystery written by Nicola Upson featuring the detectives Archie Penrose and Upson&#x27;s fictionalized version of the author Josephine Tey, published in 2021.

<text>The Reunion Island day gecko (Phelsuma borbonica) is a species of gecko. It is diurnal and lives in northern Réunion. It typically dwells on banana trees and feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the middle-sized day geckos. It can reach a total length of about 16 cm. 

The colour can vary, depending on which population they belong to. The body colour is bluish green or dark green. The head has a yellowish colour, finely mottled with brown. On the back and tail there are brownish or red-brick coloured dots which form a network of reticulated bars. The red spots on the head and neck are smaller and denser than those on the back. The ventral surface is yellowish with brown marbling.

== Distribution ==
This species only inhabits northern part of Réunion. It was found at; Les Hauts du Brûlé, Les Hauts Mensiol, Morne de Patates à Durand, near Bois de Nèfles, Belle-Vue, La Bretagne, Beaumont les Hauts, near St.Marie and Les Hauts de la Perrière near St. Suzanne.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28 °C. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>The American coot (Fulica americana), also known as a mud hen or pouldeau, is a bird of the family Rallidae. Though commonly mistaken for ducks, American coots are only distantly related to ducks, belonging to a separate order. Unlike the webbed feet of ducks, coots have broad, lobed scales on their lower legs and toes that fold back with each step to facilitate walking on dry land. Coots live near water, typically inhabiting wetlands and open water bodies in North America. Groups of coots are called covers or rafts. The oldest known coot lived to be 22 years old.

The American coot is a migratory bird that occupies most of North America. It lives in the Pacific and southwestern United States and Mexico year-round and occupies more northeastern regions during the summer breeding season. In the winter they can be found as far south as Panama. Coots generally build floating nests and lay 8–12 eggs per clutch. Females and males have similar appearances, but they can be distinguished during aggressive displays by the larger ruff (head plumage) on the male. American coots eat primarily algae and other aquatic plants but also animals (both vertebrates and invertebrates) when available.

The American coot is closely related to the Eurasian coot (&quot;Fulica atra&quot;), which occupies the same ecological niche in Eurasia and Australia as the American coot does in North America. Eurasian coots can be distinguished from this species by the absence of a red callus above the bird&#x27;s frontal shield.

The American coot is listed as &quot;Least Concern&quot; under the IUCN conservation ratings. Hunters generally avoid killing American coots because their meat is not as sought after as that of ducks.

American coots display several interesting breeding habits; mothers will preferentially feed offspring with the brightest plume feathers, which has resulted in coot chicks having brightly ornamented plumage which becomes drabber as they age. American coots are also susceptible to conspecific brood parasitism and have evolved mechanisms to differentiate their offspring from those of parasitic females.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The American coot was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other coots in the genus &quot;Fulica&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fulica americana&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Cinereous coot&quot; from North America that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;.

=== Subspecies ===
Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;F. a. americana&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1789 – southeast Alaska and Canada to Costa Rica and the West Indies
* &quot;F. a. columbiana&quot; Chapman, 1914 – Colombia and north Ecuador
The Caribbean coot, a color morph of the American coot is now included with the nominate subspecies.

=== Fossil record ===
Coot fossils from the Middle Pleistocene of California have been described as &quot;Fulica hesterna&quot; but cannot be separated from the present-day American coot. However, the Pleistocene coot &quot;Fulica shufeldti&quot; (formerly &quot;F. minor&quot;), famously known as part of the Fossil Lake fauna, quite possibly was a paleosubspecies of the American coot (as &quot;Fulica americana shufeldti&quot;) as they only differed marginally in size and proportions from living birds. Thus, it seems that the modern-type American coots evolved during the mid-late Pleistocene, a few hundred thousand years ago.

The American coot&#x27;s genus name, &quot;Fulica&quot;, is a direct borrowing of the Latin word for &quot;coot&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;americana&quot; means &quot;America&quot;.

==Description==

The American coot measures in length with a wingspan of . Adults have a short, thick, white bill and white frontal shield, which usually has a reddish-brown spot near the top of the bill between the eyes. Males and females look alike, but females are smaller. Body mass in females ranges from and in males from . Juvenile birds have olive-brown crowns and a gray body. They become adult-colored around 4 months of age.
=== Frontal shield and callus ===
The American coot is recognized by its white frontal shield with a red spot connecting its eyes. The size of the frontal shield depends on season and mating status. During the winter season, birds have smaller, &#x27;shrunken&#x27; shields. During breeding season, birds are recorded to have swelled shields. Birds that are permanently paired or mated have larger shields as well.

According to a 1949 coverage by Gordon W. Gullion, the reddish-brown spot on the frontal shield is not considered a part of the frontal shield despite its proximity to the shield. It is known as the callus. This is due to the fact that it does not completely cover the maxilla, or jawbone, of the coot. It also differs in color and texture from the shield.

===Vocalizations===
The American coot has a variety of repeated calls and sounds. Male and female coots make different types of calls to similar situations. Male alarm calls are &#x27; while female alarm calls are &#x27;. Also, stressed males go &#x27; or &#x27; while females call &quot;&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

American coots are found near water reed-ringed lakes and ponds, open marshes, and sluggish rivers. They prefer freshwater environments but may temporarily live in saltwater environments during the winter months.

The American coot&#x27;s breeding habitat extends from marshes in southern Quebec to the Pacific coast of North America and as far south as northern South America. Birds from temperate North America east of the Rocky Mountains migrate to the southern United States and southern British Columbia. It is often a year-round resident where water remains open in winter. The number of birds that stay year-round near the northern limit of the species&#x27; range seems to be increasing.

Autumn migration occurs from August to December, with males and non-breeders moving south before the females and juveniles. Spring migration to breeding ranges occurs from late February to mid-May, with males and older birds moving North first. There has been evidence of birds travelling as far north as Greenland and Iceland.

===Caribbean coot===

Coots resident in the Caribbean and Greater and Lesser Antilles lack the red portion of the frontal shield, and were previously believed to be a distinct species, the Caribbean coot (&quot;Fulica caribaea&quot;). In 2016, due to research showing that the only distinguishing characteristic between American and Caribbean coots, the presence or absence of red in the frontal shield, was not distinct to Caribbean coots as some American coots, in locations where vagrancy from Caribbean populations was highly unlikely, had fully white shields and, therefore, there was no way to reliably distinguish the species, and there was no evidence of Caribbean and American coots engaging in assortative mating, the American Ornithological Society lumped the Caribbean coot as a regional variation of the American coot.
==Behavior and ecology==
The American coot is a highly species, particularly in the winter, when its flocks can number in the thousands. When swimming on the water surface, American coots exhibit a variety of interesting collective formations, including single-file lines, high density synchronized swimming and rotational dynamics, broad arcing formations, and sequential take-off dynamics.

===Feeding===
The American coot can dive for food but can also forage and scavenge on land. Their principal source of food is aquatic vegetation, especially algae. Yet they are omnivorous, also eating arthropods, fish, and other aquatic animals. During breeding season, coots are more likely to eat aquatic insects and mollusks—which constitute the majority of a chick&#x27;s diet.

===Breeding===

The coot mating season occurs during May and June. Coot mate pairings are monogamous throughout their life, given they have a suitable territory. A typical reproductive cycle involves multiple stages: pairing, nesting, copulation, egg deposition, incubation, and hatching.
The American coot typically has long courtship periods. This courtship period is characterized by billing, bowing, and nibbling. Males generally initiate billing, which is the touching of bills between individuals. As the pair bond becomes more evident, both males and females will initiate billing only with each other and not other males or females. After a pair bond is cemented, the mating pair looks for a territory to build a nest in. A pair bond becomes permanent when a nesting territory is secured. Copulation behavior among coot pairs always falls under the same general pattern. First the male chases the female. Then, the female moves to the display platform and squats with her head under the water. The male then mounts the female, using his claws and wings to balance on the female&#x27;s back while she brings her head above the water. Sexual intercourse usually takes no longer than two seconds.

====Nests====
The American coot is a prolific builder and will create multiple structures during a single breeding season. It nests in well-concealed locations in tall reeds. There are three general types of structures: display platforms, egg nests and brood nests.
* Display platforms are used as roosting sites and are left to decompose after copulation.
* Egg nests are typically in diameter with a ramp that allows the parents to enter and exit without tearing the sides of the nests. Coots will often build multiple egg nests before selecting one to lay their eggs in.
* Brood nests are nests that are either newly constructed or have been converted from old egg nests after the eggs hatch, becoming larger egg nests.
Since American coots build on the water, their structures disintegrate easily and have short life spans. Egg and brood nests are actually elaborate rafts, and must be constantly added to in order to stay afloat. Females typically do the most work while building.

====Egg-laying and clutch size====
Females deposit one egg a day until the clutch is complete. Eggs are usually deposited between sunset and midnight. Typically, early season and first clutches average two more eggs than second nestings and late season clutches. Early season nests see an average of 9.0 eggs per clutch while late clutches see an average of 6.4 eggs per clutch. There is an inverse relationship between egg weights and laying sequence, wherein earlier eggs are larger than eggs laid later in the sequence. It is possible to induce a female coot to lay more eggs than normal by either removing all or part of her clutch. Sometimes, a female may abandon the clutch if enough eggs are removed. Coots, however, do not respond to experimental addition of eggs by laying fewer eggs.

The American coot is a persistent re-nester, and will replace lost clutches with new ones within two days of clutch-loss during deposition. One study showed that 68% of destroyed clutches are eventually replaced. Re-nested clutches are typically smaller than original clutches by one or two eggs, but this could be attributed to differences in time and habitat quality instead of food or nutrient reserves and availability.

Younger females reproduce later in the season and produce smaller eggs than older females. Their offspring are also smaller. However, there is no difference in clutch size between older and younger females as there is in other avian species.

====Incubation and hatching====
Incubation start time in the American coot is variable, and can begin anywhere from the deposition of the first egg to after the clutch is fully deposited. Starting incubation before the entire clutch has been laid is an uncommon practice among birds. Once incubation starts it continues without interruption. Male and female coots share incubation responsibility, but males do most of the work during the 21-day incubation period. Females will begin to re-nest clutches in an average of six days if clutches are destroyed during incubation.

Hatch order usually follows the same sequence as laying order. Regardless of clutch size, eight is the typical maximum size of a brood. Egg desertion is a frequent occurrence among coots because females will often deposit more than eight eggs. Brood size limits incubation time, and when a certain number of chicks have hatched the remaining eggs are abandoned. The mechanism for egg abandonment has not yet been discovered. Food resource constraints may limit the number of eggs parents let hatch, or the remaining eggs may not provide enough visual or tactile stimulation to elicit incubation behavior. An American coot can be forced to hatch more eggs than are normally laid. These additional offspring, however, suffer higher mortality rates due to inadequacy in brooding or feeding ability.

====Maternal effects====
Hormones that are passed down from the mother into the egg affect offspring growth, behavior, and social interactions. These nongenetic contributions by the mother are known as maternal effects. In the American coot, two levels of androgen and testosterone variation have been discovered—within-clutch and among-clutch variation. Within the same clutch, eggs laid earlier in the sequence have higher testosterone levels than eggs laid later in the sequence. Females that lay three clutches deposit more androgens into their yolks than females who lay only one or two clutches.

===Brood parasitism===
The American coot has a mixed reproductive strategy, and conspecific brood parasitism is a common alternative reproductive method. In one 4-year study, researchers found that 40% of nests were parasitized, and that 13% of all eggs were laid by females in nests that were not their own. Increasing reproductive success under social and ecological constraints is the primary reason for brood parasitism. Floater females without territories or nests use brood parasitism as their primary method of reproduction, if they breed at all. Other females may engage in brood parasitism if their partially complete clutches are destroyed. Conspecific brood parasitic behavior is most common among females trying to increase their total number of offspring. Food supply is the limiting factor to chick survival and starvation is the most common cause of chick morbidity. Parasitic females bypass the parental care constraint of feeding by laying additional parasitic eggs in addition to their normal nest.

When a parasitic female lays her egg in a host female&#x27;s nest, the host female experiences a deposition rate of two eggs per day. Host females may recognize parasitic eggs when the egg deposition pattern deviates from the traditional one egg per day pattern. The occurrence of brood parasitism may be influenced by the body size of the potential parasitic female relative to the potential host female. Parasitic females are generally larger than their host counterparts, but on average, there is no size difference between the parasite and the host.

The American coot, unlike other parasitized species, has the ability to recognize and reject conspecific parasitic chicks from their brood. Parents aggressively reject parasite chicks by pecking them vigorously, drowning them, preventing them from entering the nest, etc. They learn to recognize their own chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches. The first-hatched chick is a reference to which parents discriminate between later-hatched chicks. Chicks that do not match the imprinted cues are then recognized as parasite chicks and are rejected.

Chick recognition reduces the costs associated with parasitism, and coots are one of only three bird species in which this behavior has evolved. This is because hatching order is predictable in parasitized coots—host eggs will reliably hatch before parasite eggs. In other species where hatching order is not as reliable, there is a risk of misimprinting on a parasite chick first and then rejecting their own chicks. In these species, the cost of accidentally misimprinting is greater than the benefits of rejecting parasite chicks.

===Chick ornaments===
The first evidence for parental selection of exaggerated, ornamental traits in offspring was found in American coots. Black American coot chicks have conspicuously orange-tipped ornamental plumes covering the front half of their body that are known as &quot;chick ornaments&quot; that eventually get bleached out after six days. This brightly colored, exaggerated trait makes coot chicks more susceptible to predation and does not aid in thermoregulation, but remains selected for by parental choice. These plumes are not necessary for chick viability, but increased chick ornamentation increases the likelihood that a chick will be chosen as a favorite by the parents. Experimental manipulation of chick ornamentation by clipping the bright plumes has shown that parents prefer ornamented chicks over non-ornamented ones.

==Predation==

The American coot is fairly aggressive in defense of its eggs and, in combination with their protected nesting habitat, undoubtedly helps reduce losses of eggs and young to all but the most determined and effective predators. American crows, black-billed magpies and Forster&#x27;s tern can sometimes take eggs. Mammalian predators (including red foxes, coyotes, skunks and raccoons) are even less likely to predate coot nests, though nests are regularly destroyed in usurpation by muskrats. Conversely, the bold behavior of immature and adult coots leads to them falling prey with relative regularity once out of the breeding season. Regular, non-nesting-season predators include great horned owls, northern harriers, bald eagles, golden eagles, American alligators, bobcats, great black-backed and California gulls. In fact, coots may locally comprise more than 80% of the bald eagle diet.

==In culture==
On the Louisiana coast, the Cajun word for coot is pouldeau, from French for &quot;coot&quot;, &quot;poule d&#x27;eau&quot; – literally &quot;water hen&quot;. Coot can be used for cooking; it is somewhat popular in Cajun cuisine, for instance as an ingredient for gumbos cooked at home by duck hunters.

The bird is the mascot of the Toledo Mud Hens Minor League Baseball team.

==Conservation and threats==
The American coot is listed under &quot;least concern&quot; by the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. They are common and widespread, and are sometimes even considered a pest. They are rarely the targets of hunters since their meat is not considered to be as good as that of ducks; although some are shot for sport, particularly in the southeastern United States. Because they are found in wetlands, scientists use them to monitor toxin levels and pollution problems in these environments.

<text>Lady Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset, Pembroke and Montgomery, &quot;[[suo jure]]&quot; 14th Baroness de Clifford (30 January 1590 – 22 March 1676) was an English peeress. In 1605 she inherited her father&#x27;s ancient barony by writ and became &quot;suo jure&quot; 14th Baroness de Clifford. She was a patron of literature and as evidenced by her diary and many letters was a literary personage in her own right. She held the hereditary office of High Sheriff of Westmorland which role she exercised from 1653 to 1676.

==Early years==
Lady Anne was born on 30 January 1590 in Skipton Castle, and was baptised the following 22 February in Holy Trinity Church in Skipton in the West Riding of Yorkshire. She was the only surviving child and sole heiress of George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland (1558–1605) of Appleby Castle in Westmorland and of Skipton Castle, by his wife, Lady Margaret Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.

Her parents&#x27; marriage was soured by the deaths of Anne&#x27;s two elder brothers before the ages of 5 and her parents lived apart for most of her childhood. The strain of the marriage was seen in the public realm as well, especially after the separation. Her father maintained an important position at the court of Elizabeth I, while her mother received no recognition in regard to her husband at court. As her parents were separated, her mother maintained a matriarchal position in her house, for the family was kept under her care.

Anne Clifford was brought up in an almost entirely female household—evoked in Emilia Lanier&#x27;s &quot;Description of Cookeham&quot;—and received an excellent education from her tutor, the poet Samuel Daniel. As a child, she was a favourite of Elizabeth I. Accounts of her expenses in London and at Chenies between 1600 and 1602 mention her farthingale and wired rebato collar. She played the virginals, was taught to dance by Stephens, and musicians were employed at her masque entertainment.

In May 1603, Anne Clifford was staying at Northaw manor and went to see the new king, James VI and I, at Theobalds. In June, she rode north to Coventry to meet Anne of Denmark. She was not allowed to attend their coronation on 25 July for fear of the plague. She wrote a &quot;Memoir&quot; of events of 1603.

==Inheritance==
On the death of her father on 30 October 1605, she succeeded &quot;suo jure&quot; to the ancient title Baroness de Clifford, a barony created by writ in 1299, but her father&#x27;s earldom passed (according to the patent of its creation) as was usual, to the heir male, namely his younger brother Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland (1559–1641), to whom he had willed his estates. He had bequeathed to Anne the sum of £15,000. In her young adulthood, she engaged in a long and complex legal battle to obtain the family estates, which had been granted by King Edward II (1307–1327) under absolute cognatic primogeniture, instead of the £15,000 willed to her.

Her main argument was that she was just 15 years old at the time. King James I supported her rival&#x27;s claim. In January 1617, the queen, Anne of Denmark, encouraged Anne Clifford to pursue her claim and not accept a settlement promoted by King James. It was not until the death in 1643 without a male heir of Henry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland, the 4th Earl&#x27;s only son, that Anne Clifford managed to regain the family estates, although she did not obtain possession until 1649.

==At court==
Anne Clifford never became a lady in waiting or lady of the queen&#x27;s privy chamber, but she danced in masques with Anne of Denmark. She played the &quot;Nymph of the Air&quot; in Samuel Daniel&#x27;s masque &quot;Tethys&#x27;s Festival&quot;, and took roles in several of the early court masques by Ben Jonson, including &quot;The Masque of Beauty&quot; (1608) and &quot;The Masque of Queens&quot; (1609). In April 1613 she joined Anne of Denmark&#x27;s progress to Bath.

==Marriages and children==

Lady Anne married twice. Firstly, on 27 February 1609 to Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset (d.1624). Sackville&#x27;s grandfather arranged the marriage, writing in April 1607 to ask the courtier George More of Loseley to influence the Countess of Cumberland for the match with &quot;that virtuous young lady the Lady Anne&quot;. The old Earl of Dorset had to counter rumours against his family honour that he trumped negotiations for her hand from the heir to the Earl of Exeter. By her first husband Anne had five children, three sons who all died before adulthood and two daughters and co-heiresses:
* Lady Margaret Sackville (1614–1676), who married John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet (1609–1664), by whom she had eleven children. The title Baron de Clifford descended in the Tufton family.
* Lady Isabella Sackville (1622–1661), who married James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton (1622–1681).
Secondly, in 1630, Anne married the wealthy Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke and 1st Earl of Montgomery (1584–1650), whose first wife, Lady Susan de Vere had died the year before.

Both marriages were reportedly difficult; contemporaries cited Lady Anne&#x27;s unyielding personality as a cause, whilst her cousin Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, compared her to the River Rhone. A more sympathetic viewpoint would attribute some of the troubles in her first marriage to her husband&#x27;s extravagance and his infidelities. Her first husband was a prominent figure at court. Her disagreement with her husband over her inheritance claims proved another source of difficulty within their marriage. Lord Dorset believed she should settle the inheritance case rather than pursue it. A central conflict with her second husband lay in her decision to allow her younger daughter to make her own choice of husband.

A list or catalogue of the household and family of the Earl and Countess of Dorset at Knole survives. It records the names and roles of servants. It includes two African servants, Grace Robinson, a maid in the laundry, and John Morockoe, who worked in the kitchen. Both are described as &quot;Blackamoors&quot;.

==Maintaining favour at court==
Lady Anne frequently went to London and the court, in November 1617, wearing a &quot;green damask gown embroidered, without a farthingale&quot;. and met Lady Ruthin. Jane Drummond, Lady Roxburghe, and Lady Ruthin were her contacts in the queen&#x27;s household. Ruthin took Anne Clifford&#x27;s letters and gifts to Anne of Denmark, including a white satin gown embroidered with pearls and coloured silks. The pearls and embroidery cost Clifford £80 over the cost of the satin fabric. Clifford was admitted to the queen&#x27;s bedchamber where she was able to talk to King James.

Clifford sent Lady Ruthin an expensive ruffled satin skirt with £100 worth of embroidery to present to Anne of Denmark. For a New Year&#x27;s Day gift in January 1619, she sent Anne of Denmark a cloth of silver cushion embroidered with the Danish royal arms and embellished with slips of tent stitch. As well as patronising professional embroiderers, Anne embroidered a cushion with Irish stitch. Clifford last saw King James in January 1620 at Whitehall Palace after a masque in the Banqueting House. The show was Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;News from the New World Discovered in the Moon&quot;.

==Patron of arts==

She was an important patron of literature and due to her own writings in the form of letters and the diary she kept from 1603 to 1616, was a literary figure in her own right. John Donne said of her that she could &quot;discourse of all things from Predestination to Slea-silk&quot;.

Jan van Belcamp painted a huge triptych portrait of Anne Clifford to her own design and specifications. Titled &quot;The Great Picture&quot;, it portrays Lady Anne at three points in her life: at age 56 (right), at age 15 (left), and before birth in her mother&#x27;s womb (centre). In connection with the painting, Anne Clifford dated her own conception at 1 May 1589, an unusual act of precision. The painting can now be seen in the Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal, Cumbria.

Anne sent a miniature portrait of herself to her mother the Countess of Cumberland in June 1615, writing, &quot;I have sent you my picture done in little, which some says is very like me, and others say it does me rather wrong than flatters me, I know you will accept the shadow of her whose substance is come from yourself. I hope you will requite me with the same kindness and let me have yours when either you come up to London, or when so ever any that draw pictures comes into those parts where now you are.&quot;

==Building works==
In 1656 she erected the Countess Pillar near Brougham, Cumbria, in memory of her late mother. This was the site of her last meeting with her mother in 1616. On the low stone beside it, money was given to the poor on the anniversary of their parting. This is commemorated annually on 2 April.

She restored churches at Appleby-in-Westmorland, Ninekirks, Brougham and Mallerstang. She was also responsible for the improvement and expansion of many of the Clifford family&#x27;s castles across Northern England, including Skipton Castle in Yorkshire and Pendragon Castle, Brough Castle, Appleby Castle and Brougham Castle, all in Westmorland (now Cumbria).

==Later life and death==
After inheriting her father&#x27;s estates in Westmorland, when the remaining male heirs (her uncle and his son) died out, Lady Anne thus became a wealthy landowner. She was loyal to the Crown during the Civil War, defending her estates until they fell to the Parliamentarians after the Battle of Marston Moor.

She was heavily involved with her tenants to the point of filing lawsuits against them and actively pursuing rents and debts owed to her. This was to be the demeanour of her power in later life, that of a direct landowner calling upon the traditions of the baronial class. After moving north, she rotated her residence amongst her castles, living in various ones for several months to a year at a time. She died aged 86 at Brougham Castle, in the room in which her father had been born and her mother had died. At her death she was the Dowager Countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery. Her tomb and monument is in St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, Appleby-in-Westmorland.

<text>The Brummie dialect, or more formally the Birmingham dialect, is spoken by many people in Birmingham, England, and some of its surrounding area. &quot;Brummie&quot; is also a demonym for people from Birmingham. It is often erroneously used in referring to all accents of the West Midlands, as it is markedly distinct from the traditional accent of the adjacent Black Country, but modern-day population mobility has tended to blur the distinction. Population mobility has meant that to a degree, the Brummie accent extends into some parts of the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull, but much of the accent within the borough might be considered to be closer to contemporary Received Pronunciation (RP).

==Name==
The term &quot;Brummie&quot; derives from &quot;Brummagem&quot; or &quot;Bromwichham&quot;, which are historical variants of the name Birmingham.

==Accent==
The strength of a person&#x27;s accent can vary greatly all across Birmingham. As with most cities, the local accent changes relative to the area of the city in question. A common misconception is that everyone in Birmingham speaks the same accent. It could be argued that Brummie is an accent rather than a dialect as opposed to Black Country speech, which is a dialect with unique words and phrases, such as &quot;owamya?&quot; for &quot;how are you&quot;, which, many comment, is not used in Brummie speech. Similarly, Brummies generally use the word &quot;I&quot; while pronouncing it as &#x27;oy&#x27;, whereas Black Country natives instead use the dialectal term &#x27;Ah&#x27;, as in &#x27;Ah bin&#x27;, meaning &quot;I have been&quot;.

 has said that the accent is &quot;a dialectal hybrid of northern, southern, Midlands, Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire speech&quot;, also with elements from the languages and dialects of its Asian and Afro-Caribbean communities.

There are also differences between Brummie and Black Country accents, which are not readily apparent to people from outside the West Midlands. A Black Country accent and a Birmingham accent can be hard to distinguish if neither accent is that broad. Phonetician John Wells has admitted that he cannot tell any difference between the accents.

Rhymes and vocabulary in the works of William Shakespeare suggest that he used a local dialect, with many historians and scholars arguing that Shakespeare used a Stratford-upon-Avon, Brummie, Cotswold, Warwickshire or other Midlands dialect in his work. However, the veracity of this assertion is not accepted by all historians, and his accent would certainly have been entirely distinct from any modern English accent, including any modern Midlands accent.

===Stereotypes===
According to , among UK listeners &quot;Birmingham English in previous academic studies and opinion polls consistently fares as the most disfavoured variety of British English, yet with no satisfying account of the dislike&quot;. He alleges that overseas visitors, in contrast, find it &quot;lilting and melodious&quot;, and from this claims that such dislike is driven by various linguistic myths and social factors peculiar to the UK (&quot;social snobbery, negative media stereotyping, the poor public image of the City of Birmingham, and the north/south geographical and linguistic divide&quot;).

For instance, despite the city&#x27;s cultural and innovative history, its industrial background (as depicted by the arm-and-hammer in Birmingham&#x27;s coat of arms) has led to a muscular and unintelligent stereotype: a &quot;Brummagem screwdriver&quot; is UK slang for a hammer.

Thorne also cites the mass media and entertainment industry where actors, usually non-Birmingham, have used inaccurate accents and/or portrayed negative roles.

Advertisements are another medium where many perceive stereotypes. Journalist Lydia Stockdale, writing in the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, commented on advertisers&#x27; association of Birmingham accents with pigs: the pig in the ad for Colman&#x27;s Potato Bakes, Nick Park&#x27;s Hells Angel Pigs for British Gas, the puppet simply known as Pig from Pipkins and ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dave the window-cleaner pig&quot; all had Brummie accents. In 2003, a Halifax bank advertisement featuring Howard Brown, a Birmingham-born and -based employee, was replaced by an animated version with an exaggerated comical accent overdubbed by a Cockney actor.

==Pronunciation==
*In Brummie, some SQUARE words have shifted to the NEAR lexical set, such as &quot;there&quot; and &quot;where&quot;, which are thus pronounced as and instead of and , respectively. 

Urszula Clark has proposed the FACE vowel as a difference between Birmingham and Black Country pronunciation, with Birmingham speakers using /ʌɪ/ and Black Country speakers using /æɪ/. She also mentions that Black Country speakers are more likely to use /ɪʊ/ where most other accents use /juː/ (in words such as new, Hugh, stew, etc.). This /ɪʊ/ is also present in some North American dialects for words like &quot;ew&quot;, &quot;grew&quot;, &quot;new&quot;, &quot;due&quot;, etc., contrasting with /u/ (words like &quot;boo&quot;, &quot;zoo&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;too&quot;, &quot;moon&quot;, &quot;doom&quot;, etc.). Other North American dialects may use /ju/ for this purpose, or even make no distinction at all.

Below are some common features of a recognisable Brummie accent (a given speaker may not necessarily use all, or use a feature consistently). The letters enclosed in square bracketsuse the . The corresponding example words in italics are spelt so that a reader using Received Pronunciation (RP) can approximate the sounds.

* The vowel of &quot;mouth&quot; (RP ) can be or 
* The vowel of &quot;goat&quot; (RP ) can be close to (so to an RP speaker, &quot;goat&quot; may sound like &quot;gout&quot;)
* Final unstressed , as in &quot;happy&quot;, may be realised as , though this varies considerably between speakers
* In Birmingham, STRUT and FOOT may either be distinguished or merged. If the two vowels merge, they are pronounced either as or , as in northern England—see foot–strut split. 
* The majority of Brummies use the Northern in words like &quot;bath&quot;, &quot;cast&quot; and &quot;chance&quot;, although the South-Eastern is more common amongst older speakers.
* The vowels in &quot;price&quot; and &quot;choice&quot; may be almost merged as so that the two words would almost rhyme. However, the two are still distinct, unlike in the Black Country dialect.
* In more old-fashioned Brummie accents, the FORCE set of words takes and the PURE set takes , so both sets were in two syllables in broad transcription. In such an old-fashioned accent, the words &quot;paw, pour&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; would all be said differently: , , . In more modern accents, all three are said as .
* Final unstressed may be realised as 
* The letters &quot;ng&quot; often represent where RP has just (e.g. &quot;singer&quot; as , &quot;Birmingham&quot; as )—see NG-coalescence.
* is not pronounced except when prevocalic (followed by a vowel); the Brummie accent, as an urban accent of the West Midlands region, is characteristically non-rhotic. The use of linking R and intrusive R in Birmingham and the rest of the urban West Midlands region is practically universal.
* Some tapping of prevocalic (some speakers; e.g. in &quot;crime&quot; or &quot;there is&quot;)
* In a few cases, voicing of final (e.g. &quot;bus&quot; as )

Recordings of Brummie speakers with phonetic features described in SAMPA format can be found at the &quot;Collect Britain&quot; dialects site.

==Lexicon==
According to the PhD thesis of Steve Thorne at the University of Birmingham&#x27;s Department of English, Birmingham English is &quot;a dialectal hybrid of northern, southern, Midlands, Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire speech&quot; also containing elements from the languages and dialects of its Asian and Afro-Caribbean communities.

Traditional expressions used in Brummie speech include:

; Babby : variation of &quot;baby&quot;
; Bab : variation of &quot;babe&quot;
; Bawlin, bawl : to weep, as in &quot;She started to bawl&quot; (not unique to Birmingham, common in other parts of England, Canada, Australia and South Africa)
; Bottler : a popular and enjoyable song
; Blart : to weep/cry
; Cob : a crusty bread roll (originates from the idea that bread rolls look like street cobbles and may be as hard as one; soft bread rolls are known as rolls or baps)
; Each : everyone (as in &quot;Good evening each&quot;)
; Fock : a milder and more nuanced version of the swear word fuck
; Gambol : a West Midlands term for a forward roll
; Go and play up your own end : said to children from a different street than one&#x27;s own that are making a nuisance of themselves. Used as the title of the autobiographical book and musical play about the Birmingham childhood of radio presenter and entertainer Malcolm Stent
; Mom : a common variation of the word &quot;Mum&quot; (also common in the United States, South Africa and elsewhere)
; Our kid : used to refer to siblings (as in &quot;Our kid fell off his bike.&quot;) Also commonly used in the north of England
; Our wench : an affectionate term meaning &quot;one&#x27;s sister&quot;, also used sometimes by husbands referring to their wives. Derived from the word &quot;wenchs older 16th- and 17th-century meaning of &quot;young woman&quot;
; The outdoor : an exclusively West Midlands term for the off-licence, or liquor store
; Pop : another word for a carbonated drink, e.g. &quot;Do you want a glass of pop?&quot; (common in other parts of Great Britain, as well as in Canada and parts of the United States)
; Snap : food, a meal, allegedly derived from the act of eating itself (usage example: &quot;I&#x27;m off to get my snap&quot; equates to &quot;I&#x27;m leaving to get my dinner&quot;). May also refer to the tin containing lunch, a &quot;snap tin&quot;, as taken down into the pit by miners
; Scrage: a scratched cut where skin is sliced off (example, used as a verb: &quot;I fell over and badly scraged my knee&quot;)
; Suff : another word for a drain, as in the phrase &quot;put it down the suff&quot;
; Throw a wobbly : to become sulky or have a tantrum (not unique to Birmingham; also common in England, Australia and South Africa)
; Trap : to leave suddenly or flee
; Up the cut : up the canal (not unique to Birmingham)
; Yampy : mad, daft, barmy. Many from the Black Country believe &quot;yampy&quot; originates from the Dudley-Tipton area of their region, with the word also being appropriated and claimed as their own by speakers of both Birmingham and Coventry dialects. However, usage of the word is, in fact, found in areas of the Black Country both outside Birmingham and Tipton/Dudley, including areas of south Staffordshire and north Worcestershire; therefore, the term might have originated throughout a more general zone than is popularly thought.

==Notable speakers==

Examples of speakers of the Brummie dialect include TV presenter Adrian Chiles, singer/musician Christine McVie, comedian Jasper Carrott, Goodies actor and TV presenter Bill Oddie, hip-hop and garage musician Mike Skinner, rock musicians Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward (all members of the original Black Sabbath), Roy Wood, Jeff Lynne (ELO founders), and Dave Pegg (of Fairport Convention and Jethro Tull), broadcaster Les Ross, politicians Clare Short and Jess Phillips, SAS soldier and author John &quot;Brummie&quot; Stokes, TV presenter Alison Hammond, internet meme Danny G, and many actresses and actors, including Martha Howe-Douglas, Donnaleigh Bailey, Nicolas Woodman, Julie Walters, Cat Deeley, Sarah Smart, Felicity Jones, footballer Jack Grealish, John Oliver and Ryan Cartwright.

<text>Lushnjë (; locally &quot;Lushnje&quot; ; ) is a city and municipality in west-central Albania. The municipality&#x27;s population is 63,135 as of the 2023 census, in a total area of .

== History ==

In January 1920, Lushnje was a provisional capital of Albania and the place of the Congress of Lushnje. Chieftains of Albania assembled in the town and declared Tirana first a provisional and then the definitive capital of Albania.

3 km away from Lushnjë is the Savra Field. This field is on the Lushnjë-Fier road. Here the first battle between Principality of Zeta and Principality of Albania, Ottoman Empire occurred in 1385 (the Battle of Savra). 
In this battle Balsha II, the Lord of Lower Zeta from 1378 to 1385, was killed.

Along with Fier, Lushnjë was the main district of the concentration camps during the Communist Regime; the camps included the villages of Savër, Gradishtë, Bedat, Gjazë, Rrapëz, and Plug.

== Geography ==

Lushnje is in a hot Mediterranean summer type of climate. Lushnje is in the middle plains and flatland. This land is used for growing crops and raising animals. It is 30 km to Divjakë-Karavasta National Park with wetland and beaches and a lagoon. There is a Reservoir in a village in Kashar, Lushnje with many farmlands around it and a connecting canal known as Perrio. Lushnje also has many olive oil trees and is one of the leading olive oil-producing places in Albania.

=== Subdivisions ===

Subdivisions are Allkaj, Ballagat, Bubullimë, Dushk, Fier-Shegan, Golem, Hysgjokaj, Karbunarë, Kolonjë, Krutje, and Lushnjë.

== Economy ==

Lushnje is located in the Myzeqe region that is known as a main provider of agricultural products to the rest of the country and for exports to other European Countries, and home to a national Institute of Agricultural Research. During the Communism Regime, the city had factories for paper, plastic, and food processing factories. Lushnje has many olive trees. Many other business involve brick making and marble and also oil distributors and small oil refinery for gas station in and out of the city for the city.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Education ===

Lushnje has many schools from college and to pre-k. The biggest and most famous schools in Lushnje are known as &quot;Skënder Libohova&quot;, &quot;18 Tetori&quot; and &quot;Kongresi i Lushnjes&quot;. &quot;Kongresi i Lushnjes&quot; has been renovated and is one for the most modern schools in the city with painted sides and interior upgrades. The college that is situated in Lushnje is Institute of Agricultural Research Lushnje about agriculture research. &quot;Foto Puka&quot; is another school in the city that is the second largest one. There are two high schools, one is &quot;18 Tetori&quot; and the other being &quot;Vath Koreshi&quot;. The city also has a Professional Public High School, &quot;Hasan D. Gina&quot;, with special curriculums raising from informatics to auto-services.

The schools of Lushnje offer a lot of recreation for their students. &quot;Skënder Libohova&quot; school has a new multi-functional park and a basketball and soccer area. &quot;Foto Puka&quot; and &quot;Jani Nushi&quot; are more known for their soccer and volleyball respectively.

=== Transportation ===

There is one highway that passes by the outskirts of Lushnje known as the SH4. The SH4 comes from Durrës to Lushnje, and then to Fier.

There are urban buses through the city with only one straight route. The urban bus goes from the roundabout in , Lushnje, through Lushnje, and to Karbunarë, Lushnje. The ride is about 5 km and 13 minutes or less. There are buses available at the train station which can take you from Lushnje to Greece and many places in the country and Balkan region.

Due to the shutdown of trains in Albania during 1990 there have been no signs of trains.

== Demography ==

Like most southern Albanian regions, the people of Lushnje speak a Tosk dialect. The population is mixed Orthodox and Muslim, typical of southern Albanian cities. Data from the 1918 census shows that the population of Lushnje was split almost evenly between Muslims and Christians at the time of independence from the Ottoman Empire.

=== Sport ===
KS Lushnja was originally formed in 1927 and the first football game held in the city of Lushnje was played shortly after. This was a friendly game against FK Tomori Berat and the team consisted of young men from Lushnje. The club was named Kongresi i Lushnjës following a proposal from a member of parliament and signatory of the Albanian Declaration of Independence Ferit Vokopola to name the club after the Congress of Lushnje, which was where Vokopola himself was elected secretary. In 1927 a young man named Ali Fuga returned from his studies in Austria and joined the club as a player and the head coach. He returned to Albania from Austria with shirts that would be used by the club, and they had green vertical stripes which were used to symbolise the fields of Myzeqe. Although the club was formed on 21 January 1927 it was not &quot;officially&quot; formed until 27 July 1930 shortly after the formation of the Albanian Football Association a month earlier. It was known then as the Kongresi i Lushnjës literacy-artistic society. The club&#x27;s first official jerseys were green, and the first sports chief of the club was Ali Fuga, who had been a key member of the club&#x27;s pre-formation years.

In 1945 they changed their name to KS Traktori Lushnja followed by a further name change in 1950 to SK Lushnja. In 1951 it was changed to Puna Lushnja, before they returned to KS Traktori Lushnja in 1958. In 1991 the club was named KF Lushnja.

The club&#x27;s main supporters&#x27; group is called the Ultras Delegatët. Lushnje has their own volleyball team known as Ekipi i Volejbollit të Lushnjes.

<doc id="308739" wikidata="Q7313418" url="?curid=308739" title="Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union">
<text>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844 (1997), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, unanimously ruling that anti-indecency provisions of the 1996 Communications Decency Act violated the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of freedom of speech. This was the first major Supreme Court ruling on the regulation of materials distributed via the Internet.

== Background and procedural history ==
The Communications Decency Act (CDA) was an attempt to protect minors from explicit material on the Internet by criminalizing the knowing transmission of &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; messages to any recipient under 18; and also knowingly sending to a person under 18 anything &quot;that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.&quot; The American Civil Liberties Union argued that certain parts of the act were facially unconstitutional and sought a preliminary injunction preventing the government from enforcing those provisions.

Section 561 of the act required that any facial challenges be heard by a panel of three district judges; that panel granted the injunction. Because the act also permitted appeals to be heard directly by the Supreme Court, that court took the case without the usual intermediate appellate decision.

The government&#x27;s main defense of the CDA was that the Supreme Court had upheld similar decency laws in three prior decisions: &quot;Ginsberg v. New York&quot; (1968); &quot;F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation&quot; (1978); and &quot;Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.&quot; (1986). 

In &quot;Ginsberg v. New York&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that material that is not obscene may nonetheless be harmful for children, and its marketing may be regulated. In &quot;F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation&quot;, the Supreme Court upheld the possibility of the FCC delivering administrative sanctions to a radio station for broadcasting George Carlin&#x27;s &quot;Seven Dirty Words&quot; comedy routine.

In &quot;Reno v. ACLU&quot;, though, the Supreme Court held that this case law did not justify the CDA. The Court reasoned that the FCC&#x27;s sanctions were not criminal punishments, and TV and radio broadcasts, &quot;as a matter of history, had &#x27;received the most limited First Amendment protection&#x27; ... in large part because warnings could not adequately protect the listener from unexpected program content&quot;, as opposed to Internet users, who must take &quot;a series of affirmative steps&quot; to access explicit material.

Finally, in &quot;Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.&quot;, the Supreme Court upheld a zoning ordinance that kept adult movie theaters out of residential neighborhoods. The government argued that the CDA was an attempt to institute &quot;a sort of &#x27;cyberzoning&#x27; on the Internet&quot;. In &quot;Reno v. ACLU&quot;, however, the Court ruled that the &quot;time, place, and manner regulation&quot; that &quot;Renton&quot; had enacted did not correspond with the CDA, which was &quot;a content-based blanket restriction on speech&quot;.

== Opinion of the Court ==
In a nuanced decision, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote of the differences between Internet communication and previous types of communication that the Court had ruled on. In conclusion, he wrote:

We are persuaded that the CDA lacks the precision that the First Amendment requires when a statute regulates the content of speech. In order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another. That burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve. ... It is true that we have repeatedly recognized the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials. But that interest does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults. As we have explained, the Government may not &quot;reduc[e] the adult population ... to ... only what is fit for children.&quot; 

The rest of the CDA, including the &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision in Section 230 protecting Internet service providers from being liable for the words of others, was not affected by this decision and remains law.

=== Concurring opinion ===
Justice O&#x27;Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, agreed with the decision &quot;as of 1997&quot; but expressed interest in the idea of creating an &quot;adult zone&quot; on the Internet that was made inaccessible to minors through &quot;gateway technology&quot; that had been investigated by a lower district court. If such technology could be introduced, they wrote, zoning portions of the Internet to prohibit adult content could be as constitutional as such zoning is in the physical world.

<text>The sora, sora rail or Carolina crake (Porzana carolina) is a small waterbird of the rail family Rallidae, sometimes also referred to as the sora rail or sora crake, that occurs throughout much of North America. The genus name &quot;Porzana&quot; is derived from Venetian terms for small rails, and the specific &quot;carolina&quot; refers to the Carolina Colony. The common name &quot;Sora&quot; is probably taken from a Native American language.

Adult soras are long, with dark-marked brown upperparts, a blue-grey face and underparts, and black and white barring on the flanks. They have a short thick yellow bill, with black markings on the face at the base of the bill and on the throat. Sexes are similar, but young soras lack the black facial markings and have a whitish face and buff breast. They weigh about .

The sora&#x27;s breeding habitat is marshes throughout much of North America. They nest in a well-concealed location in dense vegetation. The female usually lays 10 to 12 eggs, sometimes as many as 18, in a cup built from marsh vegetation. The eggs do not all hatch together. Both parents incubate and feed the young, who leave the nest soon after they hatch and are able to fly within a month.

They migrate to the southern United States and northern South America. Sora is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, where it can be confused with spotted crake. However, the latter species always has spotting on the breast. a streaked crown stripe, and a different wing pattern.

Soras forage while walking or swimming. They are omnivores, eating seeds, insects and snails. Although soras are more often heard than seen, they are sometimes seen walking near open water. They are fairly common, despite a decrease in suitable habitat in recent times. The call is a slow whistled &quot;ker-whee&quot;, or a descending whinny.

==Taxonomy==
The sora was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the rails in the genus &quot;Rallus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Rallus carolinus&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;little American water hen&quot; that George Edwards had described and illustrated in 1750 from a specimen collected near the Hudson Bay. Linnaeus also cited Mark Catesby who had described the &quot;soree&quot; in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. The sora is now placed in the genus &quot;Porzana&quot; that was erected in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis-Pierre Vieillot. The genus name is derived from Venetian terms for small rails, the specific epithet refers to the Carolina Colony. The common name &quot;Sora&quot; is probably taken from a Native American language. The species in monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Adult soras are long, with dark-marked brown upperparts, a blue-grey face and underparts, and black and white barring on the flanks. They have a short thick yellow bill, with black markings on the face at the base of the bill and on the throat. Sexes are similar, but young soras lack the black facial markings and have a whitish face and buff breast. They weigh about and have a wingspan of 35–40 cm. Soras have two common calls: a loud, squeaking &quot;whinny&quot; that decelerates and descends in pitch, often used to advertise territories; and a softer, ascending &quot;ker-wee&quot; or &quot;sor-ah&quot;. The latter call is sometimes presented as a possible origin for the species&#x27; common name.

==Distribution and habitat==
The sora is common across North America, naturally occurring in 49 US states (the exception being Hawaii), all 10 Canadian provinces and 2 Canadian territories. Outside of US/Canada, the species is found throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. The species has been recorded as a vagrant in Iceland, Great Britain, Portugal, and at Lake Titicaca.

Soras breed from Nova Scotia northwest to southern Yukon and Northwest Territories, south to California, Arizona, and New Mexico and northeast to Pennsylvania and New England. Sora wintering grounds include the Caribbean, northern portions of South America, including Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, north through Central America and Mexico to southern California in the West and coastal regions of the Southeast. From southern Kansas south to northern and eastern Texas and east through the inland areas of the southeastern United States, soras are typically only observed during migration in the spring and fall. In a few areas of the western United States, including central California and areas of Arizona and New Mexico, soras may occur year-round.

The size of an individual Sora&#x27;s home range varies. Sora brood-rearing home ranges in northwestern Iowa averaged . In Arizona, sora home range size varied from in the early breeding season to over in the postbreeding season. These seasonal differences in sora home range size were not significant (p&gt;0.05).

Densities vary from to 12 soras/acre in Colorado to 0.47 pair/ha in Indiana. An average of 1.3 soras/ha responded to calls across sites in Colorado. A similar density of soras was found in southeastern Wisconsin. In Iowa, average density over 2 years and several marsh habitats was 1.3 pairs/ha.
≥Landscape factors, such as marsh area, habitat edges within marshes, and the number of marshes in a region may influence soras.

Although soras occur in marshes of all sizes, they may occur at higher densities in intermediate-sized marshes. Soras were significantly (p≤0.01) positively related with total wetland area and perimeter area of surface water in east and central Maine and were significantly (p&lt;0.05) positively related to area of wetlands in Saskatchewan. In Maine, soras used 10% of wetlands, 40% to 50% of wetlands from in size, and 20% of wetlands larger than . In western New York, soras were significantly (p=0.007) more abundant in marshes from in size than in smaller (&lt; ) or larger () marshes. In addition, sora nests were detected more often in the marshes.

Soras are commonly reported in plant communities dominated by cattails (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.), sedges (&quot;Carex&quot; spp.), bulrushes (&quot;Scirpus&quot; spp.), smartweeds (&quot;Polygonum&quot; spp.), rushes (&quot;Juncus&quot; spp.), rice cutgrass (&quot;Leersia oryzoides&quot;), and barnyard grasses (&quot;Echinochloa&quot; spp.).

Soras also seem to prefer edge habitats. Breeding sora density was significantly (p&lt;0.001) correlated (r=0.62) with the perimeter:area ratio of northwestern Iowa marshes. The distance from the center of sora territories to a habitat edge was also significantly (p&lt;0.005) less than from the center of Virginia rail territories. In Arizona, habitat edges were closer to sora heavy use areas than random sites.

Wetland dynamics at a large scale can affect soras. Indices of sora population at 3 &quot;levels of response&quot; were significantly (p&lt;0.01) correlated (r≥0.70) with the number of ponds present in the prairie pothole region of North Dakota in May.

Outside of wetlands, soras are most often reported in cultivated areas during migration or in the postbreeding period. For instance, a sora was observed from marshland in a cultivated field in Iowa in the middle of August. A male sora was observed less than from a large wetland in a soybean (&quot;Glycine max&quot;) field in northwestern Iowa during the postbreeding period. From early June to mid-July, soras were observed on farms in Saskatchewan sown mainly with wheat (&quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;).

Soras have also been reported in flooded wooded areas. In western New York, soras occurred during the breeding season on a study site where 26% of the area was categorized as &quot;flooded timber,&quot; and 5% was classed as &quot;scrub/shrub marsh&quot;. In eastern and central Maine, an average of 2.1 soras was observed in wooded swamps per 100 hours of observation during the breeding season. On a nonbreeding (August–April) site in southwestern Arizona, soras were found to use a &quot;mixed shrub community&quot; more than expected based on its availability. Soras were observed at low abundances on a site with douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;), ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;), and trembling aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) in British Columbia.

Soras use areas with a wide range of water depths. They are often observed in water less than deep, although the average water depth of sora heavy-use areas in Arizona was . In northwestern Iowa, average water depth in sora territories was , which was significantly (p&lt;0.025) more shallow than water depths at random locations in the marsh. Sora nesting sites occurred in shallower water than random sites in western New York. Average water depths reported at nest sites range from for 4 sora nests in Colorado to nearly for sora nests in western New York. In areas of deep water, soras typically wade on mats of floating vegetation.

Water level fluctuations may result in nest abandonment. For example, at a site in Colorado where water level increased more than , a sora nest with 7 eggs was abandoned. In Alberta, soras nested in more vegetation types during a drought year, most likely due to substantially reduced water levels in the vegetation used the previous year.

Soras use areas with shallower water in fall than in spring. Soras typically avoid open water. There is a significant (p≤0.05) negative relationship between area of open water and sora use of wetlands in Maine and sora relative abundance in Saskatchewan. In western New York, sora nesting sites had a lower percentage of open water than random sites, and in Arizona soras used open water areas less than their availability.

Sora nesting sites had larger percentage of emergent vegetation than random sites in marshes of western New York. Sora numbers in wetlands of northeastern North Dakota were significantly (p&lt;0.05) positively correlated (r=0.45) with hectares of live emergent vegetation. In east and central Maine, wetlands used by soras had significantly (p=0.01) greater area of emergent vegetation than unused wetlands.

Density of emergent vegetation in sora habitat varies. Reported density of emergent vegetation ranges from an average of 121.9 stems/m2 in sora territories in northwestern Iowa to 333 stems/m2 on sites in northeastern Missouri used during fall migration. In western New York, cover was greater than 70% at 95% of sora nests. In addition, nesting sites had more horizontal cover at 20 inches (0.5 m) above water level than random sites. However, average stem density on sora territories was not significantly (p&gt;0.05) different from random sites in northwestern Iowa.

Height of emergent vegetation in sora habitat also varies. It ranged from in the spring after a winter disturbance in northwestern Iowa to in areas heavily used by soras in Arizona. In marshes of western New York, average vegetation height at sora nesting sites was shorter than at random locations. However, the average height of emergent vegetation in sora territories in northeastern Iowa was not significantly (p&gt;0.05) different from the height of vegetation in random plots.

In Arizona, both cover and height of vegetation used by soras varied with seasons. Conway suggested the differences likely reflected the varied diet of the sora. The availability of habitat in different seasons is another possible source of seasonal differences in sora habitat.

Extent of woody vegetation surrounding South Dakota wetlands was not significantly (p=0.6) associated with sora occurrence. However, in marshes of western New York, there was a significant (p=0.041) negative relationship between percent flooded timber on a site and sora relative abundance.

Soras may prefer some cover types. In Arizona, 65.3% of sora use was in southern cattail (&quot;Typha domingensis&quot;), although it accounted for only 16.5% of the vegetation. Bulrushes and a mixed-shrub community were also used more than their availability, while saltcedar (&quot;Tamarix chinensis&quot;) and arrowweed (&quot;Pluchea sericea&quot;) were avoided. A literature review notes sora avoidance of purple loosestrife (&quot;Lythrum salicaria&quot;)-dominated sites. In east and central Maine, wetlands used by soras had significantly (p=0.05) more ericaceous vegetation, such as leatherleaves (&quot;Chamaedaphne&quot; spp.), sweetgales (&quot;Myrica&quot; spp.), and laurels (&quot;Kalmia&quot; spp.). In marshes of northwestern Iowa, broadleaf arrowhead (&quot;Sagittaria latifolia&quot;) occurred in sora territories significantly (p&lt;0.01) more often than at random sites. Johnson and Dinsmore imply that this likely results from both species preferring similar site conditions. In May and June in Wisconsin, soras were detected significantly (p&lt;0.025) more often in cattail (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.) survey areas than in sedge areas. However, in southeastern Wisconsin during the breeding season, there was no significant (p=0.943) difference in sora densities between habitats composed predominantly of cattail, sedge, or bulrush. In addition, soras&#x27; use of glaucous cattail (&quot;Typha × glauca&quot;), broadfruit bur-reed (&quot;Sparganium eurycarpum&quot;), sedge, river bulrush (&quot;Schoenoplectus fluviatilis&quot;), and hardstem bulrush (&quot;S. acutus var. acutus&quot;) habitats in marshes of northwestern Iowa generally reflected availability of these habitats.

Seasonal differences in sora habitat use have been reported. In northeastern Missouri in spring, the likelihood of detecting sora in robust emergents, such as cattail (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.) and longroot smartweed (&quot;Polygonum amphibium var. emersum&quot;), was over 6 times that of detecting soras in these areas in fall. However, availability of habitats during various times of the year was not addressed. In a study performed in southeastern Missouri, plant species used by sora during spring and fall migration differed significantly (p=0.005). However, the author qualifies this finding with his observation of major seasonal differences in vegetation availability.

Temperature may also influence sora abundance. In Colorado, average April temperature was significantly (p&lt;0.01) negatively correlated (r= -0.94) with sora abundance. On sites that had average April temperatures ≤ , soras were more abundant than the closely related Virginia rail (&quot;Rallus limicola&quot;), while on warmer sites the sora to Virginia rail ratio declined.

===Migration===
They migrate to the southern United States, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Sora is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, where it can be confused with spotted crake. However, the latter species always has spotting on the breast. a streaked crown stripe, and a different wing pattern.

Soras forage while walking or swimming. They are omnivores, eating seeds, insects and snails. Although soras are more often heard than seen, they are sometimes seen walking near open water. They are fairly common, despite a decrease in suitable habitat in recent times. The call is a slow whistled &quot;ker-whee&quot;, or a descending whinny. The use of call broadcasts greatly increases the chances of hearing a sora. Call broadcasts can also increase the chances of seeing a sora, as they will often investigate the source of the call.

Sora&#x27;s northern migration occurs in spring, primarily in April and May. For instance, in east-central Kansas significantly (p&lt;0.05) more soras were detected from 24 April to 7 May than the 2-week periods before or after. In southeast Missouri, soras were observed from 25 March to 6 May. Soras were first detected in April to early May in Colorado, Iowa, and Minnesota. In a summary of the first detections of soras in Minnesota, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, all occurred in April.

Soras depart their breeding grounds as early as July and as late as October. Soras were observed returning to wintering grounds in Arizona as early as late July. Although local movements may obscure migration occurring in July, most migration occurred in August and September in Colorado. In northern Ohio, sora abundance was increased in late August and September by migrating individuals. In southeastern Missouri, soras were observed from 5 September to 27 October. Soras have been observed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan as late as October.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===
Although sora nesting activities have been observed from late April through early August, the peak nesting period typically occurs from May to early July. In New York, nesting was initiated in late April. A nest search and literature review study of soras in Colorado reports a clutch initiated in early August. However, mean clutch initiation dates occurred in May and June in regions across the state. Studies from northern Ohio, North Dakota, and Alberta report nesting from May to July. In a review, sora nests with eggs were recorded from early May to early July in Indiana.

The sora&#x27;s breeding habitat is marshes throughout much of North America. They nest in a well-concealed location in dense vegetation. Sora females begin construction of saucer-shaped nests on the ground or on a platform over shallow water at the start of egg laying. Clutch sizes typically range from 8 to 13 eggs, although clutch sizes of up to 16 have been reported. Both parents incubate the eggs. Incubation lasts approximately 19 days, although a wide range of incubation periods has been reported in the literature. Eggs hatch over a span of 2 to 13 days. Soras also appear to exhibit egg discrimination behavior, in which they will bury and refuse to incubate irregular eggs. Nestlings are precocial and are capable of walking and swimming short distances (&lt; ) by the end of their first day. Young soras are independent by about 4 weeks of age. Soras brood once per season. Some late broods may be second nesting attempts, but there is only one report in the literature of a second brood attempt after a successful nest. For information on breeding behavior of soras, see. For information on conspecific nest parasitism and egg discrimination in soras see.

Sora nest success rates vary across locations and years. In the literature addressing sora apparent nest success, the proportions of successful nests varied from 0.61 in Michigan to 0.833 in Minnesota. In western New York, the nest success rate of 6 sora nests was 0.43, and the daily nest success rate was 0.97. Using data from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology&#x27;s nest record program, nesting success rate of soras in North America was estimated as 0.529 over a 28-day period (n=108). On a site in Alberta, 80.6% of eggs successfully hatched, while the following year only 59.6% of eggs hatched. The authors conclude that diminished water level interacting with predators and trampling by cattle resulted in decreased hatching success. During late summer, soras are flightless for a period during their post-nuptial molt.

===Food and feeding===

Soras eat a wide range of foods. Animals that are commonly reported as sora food items include snails (Gastropoda), crustaceans (Crustacea), spiders (Araneae), and insects (Insecta), mainly beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), flies (Diptera), and dragonflies (Odonata). Soras often eat the seeds of plants, such as smartweeds, bulrushes, sedges, and barnyard grasses. Seeds of annual wildrice (&quot;Zizania aquatica&quot;) and rice cutgrass are eaten by soras in the eastern United States. A literature review lists crowngrass (&quot;Paspalum&quot; spp.) and rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;) as relatively important food sources for soras in the Southeast. Plants composing less than 5% of the sora&#x27;s diet are also listed and include spikerushes (&quot;Eleocharis&quot; spp.), duckweeds (Lemnaceae), pondweeds (&quot;Potamogeton&quot; spp.), panicgrasses (&quot;Panicum&quot; spp.), cordgrasses (&quot;Spartina&quot; spp.), and saltgrass (&quot;Distichlis spicata&quot;).

Soras eat more plant food in fall and winter (68%–69%) than in spring and summer (40%). Plant material such as hairy crabgrass (&quot;Digitaria sanguinalis&quot;), fall panicgrass (&quot;Panicum dichotomiflorum&quot;), and bristlegrass (&quot;Setaria&quot; spp.) occurred at substantially higher frequencies and in much larger volumes in sora esophagi collected in southeastern Missouri during fall migration than those collected in spring. In addition, animals were a larger volume of the spring diet than the fall diet. The volume of animal material in esophagi collected in spring was predominantly composed of adult beetles and snails from the Physidae family.

===Survival===
Few data are available on the survival of soras. Radio-marked soras in Arizona had a nonbreeding survival probability of 0.308. The authors suggest the low survival rate may be due to increased mortality of radio-marked birds. Likely causes of mortality are predation and human-caused sources such as road kill.

Sora eggs are eaten by several species including American minks (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), skunks (Mephitidae), coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), grackles (&quot;Quiscalus&quot; spp.), crows (&quot;Corvus&quot; spp.), and herons (Ardeidae). Predation of adult soras by American minks, coyotes, and hawks and owls have been reported.

<doc id="308751" wikidata="Q331787" url="?curid=308751" title="Wings (1990 TV series)">
<text>Wings is an American television sitcom that ran for eight seasons on NBC from April 19, 1990, to May 21, 1997, for a total of 172 episodes.

The show is set at the fictional &quot;Tom Nevers Field&quot; airport, a small two-airline airport in Nantucket, Massachusetts (not to be confused with the actual Nantucket Memorial Airport), where brothers and pilots Joe and Brian Hackett operate Sandpiper Air, a single-plane airline. The majority of the episodes are set in the airport.

Tim Daly and Steven Weber star as Joe and Brian. Crystal Bernard plays Helen, their friend since childhood and later Joe&#x27;s love interest and wife, who runs the airport&#x27;s lunch counter but dreams of becoming a concert cellist. David Schramm plays Roy Biggins, who runs a competing airline, Aeromass. Rebecca Schull plays Fay, Joe and Brian&#x27;s employee at Sandpiper Air. Thomas Haden Church portrayed the mechanic Lowell in the first six seasons, Tony Shalhoub was taxi driver Antonio from season 3 onward, and Farrah Forke was Brian&#x27;s love interest, Alex, during seasons 4 and 5. Amy Yasbeck played Helen&#x27;s sister, Casey, from season 6 through the show&#x27;s end in season 8. Brian Haley briefly played the mechanic Budd, Lowell&#x27;s replacement, in season 7.

&quot;Wings&quot; was created and produced by &quot;Cheers&quot; veterans David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee. The trio later created the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, which was also a spin-off of &quot;Cheers&quot;. &quot;Wings&quot; exists in the same fictional universe as &quot;Cheers&quot;, and many characters from &quot;Cheers&quot; occasionally make special guest appearances on &quot;Wings&quot;. The series were produced by Grub Street Productions in association with Paramount Network Television.

==Synopsis==

Brothers Joe and Brian Hackett own Sandpiper Air, a small single-plane airline on Nantucket Island. Their childhood friend, the beautiful Helen Chappel, runs the airport’s lunch counter. She has always been in love with elder brother Joe. Helen&#x27;s dream is to play the cello in an orchestra and she attends auditions when not making sandwiches. Roy Biggins, the brothers&#x27; unscrupulous business rival, runs Aeromass, a larger airline in the same airport. Lowell Mather is the dimwitted airport mechanic, who maintains the planes for both Aeromass and Sandpiper. They are joined by an Italian immigrant, Antonio Scarpacci, who operates a taxi service and Fay Cochran, a sweet but scatterbrained widow who runs the Sandpiper ticket counter. Later in the series, Helen&#x27;s snobbish older sister Casey moves to the island and becomes the unwitting object of Antonio&#x27;s affections. She later becomes romantically involved with, and roommates with, Brian.

==Cast and characters==
=== Cast changes ===
Tim Daly, Steven Weber, Crystal Bernard, David Schramm, and Rebecca Schull starred in all eight seasons. With a few exceptions, the cast was mostly consistent for the show&#x27;s run:

* Thomas Haden Church was a main cast member for the first six seasons. He left the show in spring 1995, at the end of Season 6, to star in the Fox sitcom &quot;Ned and Stacey.&quot; He later returned for a guest appearance in an episode of Season 7 to wrap up his storyline and was invited back for the finale at the end of Season 8, but declined, though he was in the audience during the taping.
* Tony Shalhoub joined the cast as a taxi driver in Season 3, having previously made a guest appearance as a waiter in a Season 2 episode. Shalhoub so impressed the producers with his one-shot appearance that he was signed as a main character for the rest of the show. References are made to him working as a waiter in New York City and elsewhere.
* Farrah Forke featured in Season 4 and became a main character in Season 5, returning briefly for a guest appearance the following season.
* Amy Yasbeck joined the cast in Season 6 and remained until the end of the show&#x27;s run.
* After Thomas Haden Church&#x27;s departure, Brian Haley briefly joined the cast as the new mechanic for a few episodes of Season 7 before the character was written out without explanation.

=== Main characters ===

==== Joe Hackett ====
Played by Tim Daly, Joseph Montgomery Hackett is a highly responsible, compulsively neat pilot who co-owns the one-plane airline Sandpiper Air on Nantucket Island with his brother Brian. Joe is usually the straight man and the nice guy. He dreamed of becoming a pilot as a child, and became the de facto patriarch of the Hackett family after their mother disappeared, which caused their father to go insane and become institutionalized.

Joe intended to launch Sandpiper Air with his fiancée Carol behind the ticket counter, but his brother Brian ran off with her prior to the start of the series, causing a between the brothers. Joe is a big sports fan, supporting the Boston Red Sox, Boston Bruins, New England Patriots, and Boston Celtics. He grew up playing baseball and football and played on both varsity teams in high school. Joe graduated Boston College and says he pledged a fraternity, but never mentions which one. Joe eventually falls in love with Helen Chappel, his childhood friend.

==== Brian Hackett ====

Played by Steven Weber, Brian Michael Hackett is the younger and more carefree of the brothers and co-owns Sandpiper Air with Joe. His irresponsibility is often a source of consternation for Joe. He had a &quot;free ride&quot; to Princeton and dropped out, was accepted into the Astronaut training program at NASA and was expelled because he took dates into the simulator, and lost other lucrative opportunities due to his chronic irresponsibility.

Ironically, when Brian attempts to act responsibly it causes problems for Joe; When Brian managed to hold down a job flying charter flights on the Caribbean island of Mustique, he was emboldened to seduce Carol to run off to Mustique with him, which caused Joe to cut Brian out of his life.

When Carol leaves Brian for another man and their father Donald Hackett dies, Brian returns to Nantucket, and Joe is eventually persuaded not only to allow him to move into his house, but also to give Brian a job at Sandpiper Air (after some posthumous support from the father). Soon they become partners in the airline. Brian ultimately becomes Joe&#x27;s best friend. Brian is a shameless womanizer for most of the series, but has two significant relationships: the first with helicopter pilot Alex Lambert, and then with Casey Chappel Davenport, Helen&#x27;s older sister.

While &quot;Wings&quot; was on the air, Weber reprised the role of Brian on an episode of &quot;Duckman&quot; titled &quot;Role with It&quot;.

==== Helen Chappel ====
Played by Crystal Bernard, Helen is a petite blonde who speaks with a Texas drawl despite having lived on Nantucket for most of her life. It is explained that her family moved to the island from Texas when she was ten years old. Though Helen dreams of playing the cello in a large symphony orchestra, she runs the lunch counter in the airport terminal and never manages to get a music career off the ground until the final episode. Occasionally, Helen earns money teaching the cello.

A running gag related to her music is that bad luck follows her when she plays. Examples include: Helen having to join a string quartet of neurotic individuals as it is the only group at the time who accepts her; Helen being accepted by a state-run symphony, only to learn the state legislature eliminated the funding; the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) appreciating a cassette of her cello playing, but losing the label and having no way to contact her; and when she finally gets a chance to play for the BSO, the plane crashes en route.

Helen battles a compulsive eating habit that caused her to be obese in her youth. Though successful at losing the weight sometime after Brian eloped with Carol, it is still a spectre in her life and a blight on her self-image. She tends to gain weight when Carol comes to town and makes Helen a mess. She has been a lifelong friend of both Hackett brothers and dreamed of marrying Joe from a young age. Helen marries Antonio to prevent him from being deported. Although Antonio wins the Green Card Lottery and agrees to end the marriage, when Helen tries to get a marriage license to marry Joe, she finds out she is still married to Antonio. Roy advises her to get a quick divorce in Mexico. At the sixth season finale, Helen is finally able to marry Joe.

The writers originally had a different character in mind, written for Peri Gilpin, who would have played a woman of Greek heritage. However Gilpin was unable to commit to the role, and the character of Helen was created for Bernard. Gilpin, however, did star on one episode of &quot;Wings&quot; in the third season, and was later cast as Roz Doyle on &quot;Frasier&quot;.

==== Fay Cochran ====
Played by Rebecca Schull, Fay is Joe&#x27;s only other regular employee besides Brian (Kenny was an employee briefly in season 2). She is a retired flight attendant who handles the ticket counter, baggage check, and flight announcements for Sandpiper Air. She grew up in Syracuse, NY (next to a chop shop), and lived in Hawaii before moving to Nantucket. She is generally sweet and motherly, though slightly batty. She looks after the younger members of their circle as her children, although she can be sweetly manipulative. She came to work for Joe when he met her on a flight to Hawaii right after Carol left him for Brian.

Fay is thrice widowed; all three of her husbands were named George, and she jokes about a curse that if she marries a man named George, he will die prematurely. In one episode she almost marries a man named Lyle, only to learn that &quot;Lyle&quot; is only his middle name and his first name is George. Her full name is Fay Evelyn Schlob Dumbly DeVay Cochran.

Fay has a streak in which she has touched every First Lady of the United States since Eleanor Roosevelt.

==== Roy Biggins ====
Played by David Schramm, Roy Peterman Biggins is the owner of Aeromass, the only other airline on Nantucket and, with seven planes, a larger business than Sandpiper. Roy has been unable to break into the lucrative business of charter flights. He is also a member of the City Council of Nantucket. It is revealed that he started Aeromass with money inherited from an uncle. He usually addresses the cast by their last names.

Generally competitive, arrogant, and unpleasant, Roy belittles Joe for having a small-time operation and mocks Joe&#x27;s business skills. Despite this, Roy feels threatened by Joe&#x27;s presence as a competitor and makes numerous attempts either to buy Sandpiper or put it out of business. Roy is generally the rival of the group.

Roy was married to a woman named Sylvia, played by Concetta Tomei. For several years he claims that she had died, but it is later revealed that she left him and is now married to a wealthy plastic surgeon and living in Boston. When she shows up on the island seeking to hook up with Roy, he&#x27;s initially thrilled until he realizes that she still loathes him and only wants to sleep with him to get revenge on her cheating husband; he&#x27;s willing to go through with it because he likes sex, but after Brian surprisingly tells Roy he doesn&#x27;t deserve to be treated that way, Roy gets his own revenge by showing up for the rendezvous (where Sylvia both confirms she&#x27;s out for revenge and that her husband needs to be thoroughly humiliated and nothing could do that more effectively than cuckolding him with ROY) and then telling Sylvia that he&#x27;s sorry--he&#x27;s just there to end things for good because &quot;I&#x27;m such a tease!&quot; The couple has one son, R.J. (Roy Junior), who is homosexual. It takes a while for Roy to support him and become proud of him.

Roy is the most dishonest businessman on the island. Examples include forcing a customer who has just ordered a large meal from Helen to board the plane immediately, and then stealing both the meal and the money the customer leaves for Helen. He also establishes false charities including one for his &quot;late wife&quot; and uses the proceeds for fly-fishing trips or to subscribe to the Playboy Channel.

Roy has an autographed picture of Richard Nixon in his office, and was once arrested for trying to force his way aboard Air Force One to have a picture taken of himself shaking hands with President George H. W. Bush.

Also in his office he has a poster of a woman wearing a thong bikini riding on a unicycle. He comments, &quot;If that was Paris and she was holding a loaf of bread, they&#x27;d call it art.&quot;

While normally conniving and arrogant, Roy does have a sense of fun: since his birthday is February 29, 1948, a leap year, he celebrates it only once every four years as if he were only a quarter of his real age. He drives a purple El Camino, on which he claims he can disconnect the brake lights in order to engage in insurance fraud by being intentionally rear-ended by people driving luxury cars.

Despite his sleazy and conniving nature, Roy does have a more generous side: when Helen finds out that she was not properly divorced from her sham marriage to Antonio, Roy helps her concoct an elaborate plan to send Joe away for a weekend of fly fishing in Maine while she, Brian and Antonio fly to Tampico, Mexico to get a &quot;quickie&quot; divorce from a Senor Pepe. Roy does not try to blackmail Helen or demand money, simply asking Helen to deliver a message to Senor Pepe, &quot;The donkey has died.&quot;

==== Lowell Mather ====
(Season 1–6, Guest in Season 7) Played by Thomas Haden Church, Lowell is a dim-witted mechanic/handyman who works at the airport. He is a &quot;free agent&quot; of sorts, on the payroll of both Sandpiper and its rival airline Aeromass, as well as anyone else willing to pay him for repairs. He claims that while he is not an orphan, his brother is. He is friendly with all the staff. Lowell has known Brian, Joe and Helen since they were kids. He was married to a woman named Bunny with whom he had several children, but they divorced when Lowell learned that Bunny was sleeping around.

After Brian sinks the houseboat Lowell lives on, Lowell lives with Joe and Brian for a time, where he reveals a surprising talent for cooking. After about a year, however, his eccentricities became unbearable to the Hacketts, and they kick him out to find his own place, which coincides with the conclusion of the insurance investigation, the payout allowing him to buy himself a house on land.

Eventually, Lowell is forced to leave Nantucket and enter the Witness Protection Program after witnessing a mob hit. Although it is hard for him to leave the people he has known all his life, Lowell decides he would rather go into hiding than let a guilty man go free to possibly kill again.

Lowell usually wears a grease-stained orange ball cap, although he is sometimes seen without it at times when it is rude to wear hats indoors. During a later season, Lowell&#x27;s orange hat goes missing. From then on he wears a red hat in its place. When Lowell leaves Nantucket, he gives the red hat to Joe and Brian to remember him by. The brothers nail the hat to the wall of the hangar in memoriam.

==== Antonio Scarpacci ====
(Guest in Season 2, Main Season 3–8) Played by Tony Shalhoub, Antonio V. Scarpacci is an Italian immigrant from Apecchio (in the Central Italian region of Marche), who owns and operates a taxi service to and from the airport. Antonio is mild-mannered, deferential, and hopelessly romantic; he falls head-over-heels for Helen&#x27;s older sister Casey when she returns to Nantucket, although his feelings are not reciprocated. Antonio was originally a waiter, and made a guest appearance in the second season in this role before becoming an official cast member in the third season (by which time he had changed professions). Helen marries him to save him from deportation. The marriage lasts for three years (unbeknownst to either one of them) long after Antonio has his green card, due to an error on Helen&#x27;s part. He is a big fan of the &quot;Mary Pat Lee Show&quot;. Antonio is also friends with Joe, Helen, Brian, Lowell and Faye. He is sometimes annoyed and bullied by Roy.

After the series ended, &quot;Wings&quot; was referenced in the season one finale of Shalhoub&#x27;s later series &quot;Monk&quot;, where Shalhoub&#x27;s character Adrian Monk and his assistant Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) run into Tim Daly (playing himself), and Sharona says he was the star of &quot;Wings&quot;. Monk responds &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen it, but I heard it was good,&quot; in an obvious in-joke.

==== Alex Lambert ====
(Season 4–5, Guest in Season 6) Played by Farrah Forke, Alex is a helicopter pilot who moves to Nantucket to start a helicopter tour business. She has previously flown U.S. Army Apache helicopters in Desert Storm. It is discovered that she posed for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Though she initially rebuffs the amorous attentions of both Hackett brothers, she eventually falls for Brian&#x27;s boyish charms. She and Brian live together briefly, but after Brian spends a wild night in New York with Joe and an old friend, Alex throws him out of the apartment and leaves Nantucket for good. She returns a season later to resolve some of the bitterness in their breakup; she and Brian briefly get back together before they both decide it is best to go their separate ways.

==== Casey Chappel ====
(Season 6–8) Played by Amy Yasbeck, Cassandra &quot;Casey&quot; (Chappel) Davenport is Helen&#x27;s older sister. She returns to Nantucket after being abandoned by her husband, Stuart Davenport (played by John Ritter, who was Yasbeck&#x27;s real life partner and later husband), but despite having grown up there she has difficulty adjusting her upper crust tastes and sensibilities to a working class life on the small island. Antonio falls madly in love with Casey, but she takes little notice of him. Unlike Helen, Casey dropped her Southern accent when she moved to Nantucket. She spends much of season six unemployed and mooching off Helen, until she starts working for Nantucket&#x27;s tourism organization in season seven.

After she and Brian spend the better part of a season sniping at each other, they have sex the night before Joe and Helen&#x27;s wedding. Afterward, they are unable to stay away from each other and have a passionate affair; while Joe and Helen are on their honeymoon, Casey&#x27;s bra lands on the hearth of the lit fireplace and leads to Helen&#x27;s house burning down. Casey&#x27;s relationship with Brian cools after that, but they maintain a friendship. When she first appears in the show, Casey goes by her married name of Davenport, but after she and Stuart divorce at the end of season seven, she reverts to Chappel.

====Budd Bronski====
(Season 7) Played by Brian Haley, Budd is a retired US Marine who is hired to replace Lowell. Budd is Lowell&#x27;s equal as a skilled mechanic and earnest worker, but also as a quirky character. He is jumpy and insecure, and is haunted by an incident in his past when an aircraft he worked on crashed, causing him to face a court martial. Although the military cleared him of charges, Budd continues to blame himself for the incident until Brian convinces him to let it go. Occasionally, Budd astonishes everyone with magic tricks, but otherwise he has difficulty interacting with others. After being introduced early in the seventh season, Budd disappears toward the end of the season and is never mentioned again.

===Recurring characters and notable guest stars===
Carlton Blanchard: played by William Hickey, Carlton is an older man with a high-pitched nasal voice whose outwardly meek yet privately demanding behavior causes everyone who meets him to shudder at his approach. He is known to ask bizarre questions such as &quot;If you were to carpet Florida, how long would it take to vacuum it?&quot; and &quot;If a monkey were to bite you, what kind of drugs do you suppose they&#x27;d give you?&quot; He annoys Joe, Brian, Lowell and Antonio when he demands to be flown to Las Cruces, New Mexico, far beyond the scope of Sandpiper&#x27;s routes. However, the brothers reluctantly agree as Carlton won a charity contest sponsored by Sandpiper and the rules did say the winner &quot;will be flown anywhere&quot;. In another episode, he tricks Helen into throwing him a birthday party and then falls down her stairs to force her to take care of him for a week. Though none of the regulars like Carlton, he is especially disliked by Antonio, a situation made worse when Carlton repeatedly calls him &quot;Angelo&quot;. Hickey&#x27;s casting was a nod to the 1927 film &quot;Wings&quot;, Hickey being born in same year as its debut and the name &quot;Carlton Blanchard&quot; being one of the film&#x27;s characters, played by a different actor named William Hickey.

Lewis Blanchard: played by Gilbert Gottfried, he is Carlton&#x27;s equally irritating nephew. He is very rude and abrasive and makes only the slightest of attempts to hide his wish for Carlton to die so he can inherit his money. He seems to have crushes on Casey, Helen, and Alex, who are all repulsed by his lewd remarks.

Donald Hackett: played by Don Murray, Joe and Brian&#x27;s deceased father took it hard when his wife, the boys&#x27; mother, walked out on the family. He was committed to a mental institution and died just prior to the beginning of the series.

He has a good sense of humor, and in the series premiere his will was required to be read to Brian and Joe together, forcing them to reunite after their six-year estrangement. He willed them a key which opened up a lockbox to another key, then another, which had Joe and Brian go to Boston then back to Nantucket airport where they ended up finding a suitcase full of spring snakes and a photograph of them as children, encouraging them always to value their kinship.

After Brian and Casey burn down Joe&#x27;s house, Joe is fed up with Brian&#x27;s string of irresponsible behavior and fires him from Sandpiper and orders him never to speak to him again. The ghost of their father appears and uses reverse psychology to convince Joe to make peace with Brian.

Lou: played by Phil Leeds, Lou is a feisty old man who is introduced in Season Seven&#x27;s &quot;The Lyin&#x27; King&quot;. In that episode, Joe, in order to assuage his guilt over a plan to go to a strip club, volunteers at the senior citizens&#x27; home, where he is assigned to spend time with Lou. After spending a moment complaining about how lousy nursing home life is, Lou manages to guilt trip Joe into taking him to the strip club. Though Joe is somewhat tolerant of Lou, Brian is decidedly less so, referring to him derisively as &quot;Yoda&quot; (due to Lou&#x27;s shriveled physical appearance). Lou makes it clear he does not care for Brian either. Lou is also prone to talking about a rift he had in the past with his brother Harry, prompting his catchphrase, &quot;He screwed me blue!&quot; Lou was originally intended as a one-shot appearance, but proved so popular that he was brought back in the show&#x27;s final season, along with his brother Harry, played by Abe Vigoda.

Davis Lynch: played by Mark Harelik, Davis is a businessman Joe flies to Nantucket to invest in the airline. Though he rejects Joe&#x27;s offer (and ends up investing in Roy&#x27;s airline), he ends up dating Helen and eventually proposes to her. Helen accepts, but ends up leaving him for Joe. Toward the end of the series, Helen reveals she never broke off the engagement. She had figured he was gone after he was skirted off to Burma in the wake of a coup d&#x27;etat to salvage major investments he had in the company. He was then placed under house arrest by the military junta. Upon his release, Davis returns to see Helen, but while she is trying to work up the courage to tell him she has married someone else, Davis announces that he will be unable to marry her, having fallen in love with a woman who worked for the State Department and risked her life to secure his release.

Roy Biggins, Jr. (a.k.a. R.J.): played by Abraham Benrubi, Roy&#x27;s only son is secretly gay. Roy trained R.J. how to do &quot;guy stuff&quot; such as playing football. The first time R.J. is shown is when he is a high school student taking cello lessons from Helen as an extracurricular activity. R.J. reveals to everyone he is a homosexual. Roy does not take this news well and challenges him to a game of one-on-one basketball on the condition that if R.J. wins he is &quot;allowed&quot; to be gay, but if Roy wins R.J. is not. R.J. wins game after game against Roy, but Roy refuses to give up.

R.J. returns much later in the series after being estranged from Roy for a long time. He has since graduated from law school and plans to take the Massachusetts Bar Exam. Roy is proud of R.J. and his accomplishments, but only so long as R.J.&#x27;s homosexuality is not discussed. The issue finally comes to a head at Roy&#x27;s birthday party, when he accuses R.J. of throwing his lifestyle in his face and ruining his party by bringing his boyfriend Luke (Tim Bagley). After R.J. and Luke walk out, Helen talks to Roy, reminding him that while he does not have to like it, he does have to accept it, because the alternative is accepting that it may be another six years, or longer, before he sees R.J. again. Roy catches up with R.J. just as he and Luke are boarding a flight and fumbles an apology. R.J. loses patience, and points out that Roy cannot even say the word &quot;gay.&quot; Desperate to stop R.J. from walking out of his life forever, Roy finally acknowledges it, and says that he wants to understand it. The two men hug.

Gail Scott: played by Gretchen German, she is Joe&#x27;s girlfriend during the first part of Season Three. They begin dating while Helen is in New York. When Joe persuades Helen to move back to Nantucket because she is unhappy in New York, he does not tell her about his relationship with Gail because of his worry that it will prevent Helen from moving back to Nantucket.

Helen, convinced that she and Joe will pick up right where they left off, does come back, but soon discovers the truth about Joe and Gail. Believing that Joe intended to hurt her by not disclosing his relationship with Gail, Helen drives her jeep through Joe and Brian&#x27;s office.

Gail is in three episodes, but is mentioned in several others, including phone conversations. She is a journalist who constantly travels. She and Helen become friends briefly, but Gail leaves Joe when she catches Joe and Helen kissing in his kitchen.

Sandy Cooper: played by Valerie Mahaffey, Sandy is a friend of Joe, Brian, and Helen from high school. She has an obsessive crush on Joe, but he is unable to convince anyone else of this because she acts normal except when she is alone with Joe, who gives her the nickname &quot;Psycho Sandy&quot;. She appears on Nantucket occasionally and carefully plans her fantasy life with &quot;Joey Bear&quot; at moments when the two of them are alone. Her fantasies include a re-enacted high school prom in the basement of her old house, the couple&#x27;s wedding and honeymoon in Helen&#x27;s living room, and the birth of their first child in Joe&#x27;s therapist&#x27;s office. In one episode, Sandy is shown to be dating Brian, but the relationship is never pursued by the show&#x27;s writers.

Kenny McElvey: played by Michael Manasseri, Kenny is an 18-year-old who becomes Sandpiper&#x27;s backup pilot during a second season story arc where Joe is grounded for hypertension. The comedic focus of the character is his youth and relative inexperience, but he is the most qualified of the small pool of applicants to be Joe&#x27;s replacement. Kenny leaves Sandpiper after Joe is cleared to fly. One episode shows Kenny also working at a fast food joint to supplement his meager income from Sandpiper.

Bunny Mather: played by Laura Innes, Lowell&#x27;s wife flirts with nearly every man she encounters, and has sex with many of them. At one point she pursues Joe and Brian – her fantasy is to sleep with two co-workers. She once sleeps with Antonio, causing he and Lowell to come to blows. Lowell separates from her early in the series, and divorces her when he learns of her affairs. Despite their issues, Lowell and Bunny sleep together the very night they get divorced.

Sylvia: played by Concetta Tomei, Roy&#x27;s ex-wife who divorced him and married a plastic surgeon. Roy initially tells people that she is dead, but after being caught in this lie, he goes to see her, only to find out that she has a new husband and a new life. She returns to the island in season 5 to sleep with Roy in an attempt to get back at her current husband for having an affair. Roy finds out and decides not to go through with it.

Mary Pat Lee: played by Caroline Aaron, she is a dishonest, bullying Boston talk show host who tricks Brian onto her show in season 6 to meet up with his ex-girlfriend Alex. She returns two seasons later as Roy&#x27;s new girlfriend, though Roy dumps her when she uses their relationship to get Joe and Helen on her show to ambush them about a momentary slump in their sex life. Antonio is one of her biggest fans. Her budding relationship with Roy causes Antonio to mutter, &quot;But... she&#x27;s Mary Pat Lee... and he&#x27;s... Roy.&quot; She is never seen again after Roy dumps her. She seems to be a parody of both Kathie Lee Gifford and Geraldo Rivera, with all the traits people hate about the two.

Edgar Clayton: played by Mitchell Ryan, he is a wealthy industrialist who buys Sandpiper from Joe and Brian to keep it from going under. He installs his son Cord as the new president only to see Cord fail miserably. He also fires his uncle Mike in front of his board of directors and has been known to give terminated employees &quot;The Big Ugly&quot;. He is part of a three-part story arc, &quot;Wingless&quot;, during the show&#x27;s final season. Though he is identified in the closing credits as Jonathan Clayton, his name in dialogue is said to be Edgar Clayton.

Eleanor &quot;Bluto&quot; Biggins: played by Rose Marie, Roy&#x27;s eccentric mother who lives in a nursing home. She is a meddlesome, domineering nag and Roy feels threatened by her. Joe, however, stands up to her and calls her a &quot;Miserable Old Gargoyle&quot;. Eleanor is also a heavy drinker and Roy once says she has to be &quot;cut off after six boilermakers.&quot; She is frequently mentioned, but is not seen until the final season.

Walter: played by Ralph Bruneau, he is an air traffic controller. Though he envisions himself as cool and collected he is generally hyperactive and easily distracted. He acts overly friendly toward both Joe and Brian, both of whom find him highly irritating. In season 4, Walter gets married; though he does not appear on-screen after that, he continues to be mentioned frequently. He takes a temporary leave of absence in Season 6 to have eye surgery to correct a double vision problem. In the final episode, he is said to be cheating on his wife.

Mark: played by John Hawkes, he is the waiter at the Crab Restaurant. He becomes infatuated with Helen, who later pushes him toward Alex.

==Locale==
The series takes place primarily at the fictional Nantucket airport Tom Nevers Field. Until 1976, the real-life island was the site of the United States Navy&#x27;s Tom Nevers Naval Facility, later the home of the Nantucket Hunting Association. The Club Car (a real restaurant on Nantucket) is also often featured on the show.

The airplane for the show was a 1981 Cessna 402C, one of which was C/N 402C0507, N121PB, owned and operated by Express Air, owned and operated by Mike Josefek and Richard Sevigny. The pilot during the filming was Austin Carey. The aircraft was eventually sold to Cape Air where it flew until December 2023, when it was scrapped for parts. In the pilot episode (as well as a few other episodes) the airplane fuselage shown in the hangar was C/N 4110069, N121PP (which was destroyed).

==British pilot (1996) ==
A pilot for a British remake also called &quot;Wings&quot; was filmed in 1996. It was commissioned by Channel 3 North East and Yorkshire Television. The title of the episode is &quot;The Legacy&quot; (similar to the original show&#x27;s pilot episode being called &quot;Legacy&quot;). Much of the dialogue is lifted word-for-word from the original pilot episode (with some elements also taken directly from the original&#x27;s Season 2 premiere episode &quot;The Puppetmaster&quot;, written by Philip LaZebnik), as are many of the character names, the location now moving to Jersey in the Channel Islands. Even the look of the set is almost identical to the original series. Sandpiper Air retains its name though Roy&#x27;s competitor airline, Aeromass, has been changed to Goldhawk Air. Very little is known about this attempt at the remake. Seemingly only one episode was filmed and likely aired on November 19, 1996. It was directed by Roy Gould, produced by Andrew Benson, and scripted by all of the original creators—David Angell, Peter Casey, David Lee (or because their original pilot script was used), who are also credited as creators of the remake—and starred Tony Gardner and Jonathan Cake as brothers Michael and Steve Hackett (formerly Joe and Brian Hackett in the original), with Una Stubbs portraying Fay and Debra Beaumont as Helen Chappel. The character of Roy also appeared, played by Tim Wylton, as did Lowell, now renamed Noel and played by Bob Mason. Jason Hall was credited as Passenger and Anthony Schaeffer as Dispatcher. Some limited footage (a handful of clips totalling less than two minutes) surfaced online. With very little known and scant existing footage, this could be an example of a lost television broadcast.

==&quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot; tie-ins==
Although not a spin-off, &quot;Wings&quot; takes place in the same universe as &quot;Cheers&quot;, and by extension, its spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;. Several episodes had tie-ins with &quot;Cheers&quot;; Kelsey Grammer (who was nominated for an Emmy for his guest appearance), Bebe Neuwirth, George Wendt, John Ratzenberger, and Kirstie Alley all appeared on &quot;Wings&quot; playing their &quot;Cheers&quot; characters.

* Cliff Clavin and Norm Peterson visit Nantucket in the season two episode &quot;The Story of Joe&quot;. Their goal is ostensibly to go fishing, but the two never seem to get any farther than the island&#x27;s drinking establishments.
* Frasier and Lilith Crane were the focus of the season three episode &quot;Planes, Trains, &amp; Visiting Cranes.&quot; In the episode, Frasier and a skeptical Lilith come to Nantucket to put on a motivational seminar, but run into opposition from Helen Chappel, a dissatisfied former customer of Frasier&#x27;s program. In the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;License to Hill&quot;, which aired the same night as that particular &quot;Wings&quot; episode, Frasier even mentions that he and Lilith are going to Nantucket, foreshadowing their crossover appearance.
* Rebecca Howe has a cameo appearance in the season four episode &quot;I Love Brian&quot;, whose plot revolves around Brian&#x27;s attempt to infiltrate a post-concert party in Clint Black&#x27;s hotel room. As Rebecca is seen being asked to leave by Black&#x27;s bouncer, she begs Black to come to the bar in Boston where she works so she can prove to the others there that she knows him. Black responds, &quot;Maybe next year,&quot; causing Rebecca to exclaim right before she is kicked out of the party, &quot;But none of you know where we&#x27;re going to be next year!&quot;, a reference &quot;Cheers&quot; being in its final season on television.

In addition, Peri Gilpin—who had also appeared in &quot;Cheers&quot; and was later known for playing Roz in &quot;Frasier&quot;—was originally up for the role of Helen Chappel and also appeared in the &quot;Wings&quot; Season 3 episode &quot;Four Dates That Will Live in Infamy&quot; playing a different character, while her character on Frasier, Roz Doyle, is named as a tribute to one of &quot;Wings&quot;″s producers, who died from breast cancer in 1991.

Rebecca Schull and Tony Shalhoub both guest-starred on episodes of &quot;Frasier&quot; as different characters (Shalhoub in the Season 3 episode &quot;The Focus Group&quot; and Schull in the Season 7 episode &quot;RDWRER&quot;). In the Season 9 episode &quot;Bla-Z-Boy&quot; Niles (David Hyde Pierce) plays the &quot;Wings&quot; theme song (Schubert&#x27;s Piano sonata No. 20 in A Major, D. 959, IV. Rondo. Allegretto.).

Also, several of the same extras and actors in smaller supporting parts appear across all three shows, so it is not unusual to spot familiar faces in the airport in &quot;Wings&quot;, the bar in &quot;Cheers&quot;, and sometimes on &quot;Frasier&quot; as well.

==Episodes==

==Broadcast history==
In Italy, the series aired on Rete 4 in 1995.

In the United Kingdom, the series aired on Sky One and Paramount Comedy Channel from 1991 to 1997.

TVNZ aired the show in New Zealand on Channel 2 throughout the 1990s, usually immediately after &quot;Cheers&quot;.

Reruns of the show have previously aired on the USA Network, Nick at Nite and TV Land. The show can currently be seen on both Antenna TV and spinoff subchannel Rewind TV and Paramount+.

It has also been available on several other services, including CBS All Access (now Paramount+), Hulu Plus, Netflix (DVD only), the now defunct Comedy Gold, and on a Wings channel on Pluto TV.

==Awards and nominations==

==Home media==
Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD have released the entire series on DVD in Region 1.

On September 6, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series. They have subsequently re-released the first four seasons.

On July 3, 2014, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment would release a complete series set on DVD on November 11, 2014.

==Music, opening sequence and closing credits==
The theme was a shortened version of the final movement from Franz Schubert&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 20 in A major, D. 959. Schubert received screen credit as the theme composer in every episode.

The opening theme heard during the first two and a half seasons was a fairly straightforward arrangement of piano and strings. It starts with a shot of Brant Point Lighthouse with seagulls crying in the background. The title card is shown, then the cast members&#x27; names as the plane flies over various places and finally into Nantucket Memorial Airport. The Nantucket Airport control tower is seen with a reflection of the plane landing in the window with the show creators&#x27; names onscreen. The slow opening theme was dropped in January 1992 as episodes began using a cold open, with simply the title card and the cast members and creators. In the season 4 finale the cold open was brusquely interrupted to show the plane caught in a violent thunderstorm instead of the usual clear skies.-

The closing sequence used in seasons 1–5 was accompanied by the plane flying over Nantucket Sound in a sunrise setting. A jazzed-up version of the theme was heard during the closing credits for the first two seasons, then a more up-tempo version with a piano lead from season 3 onward. The closing credits were changed in season 6 with the tag scene accompanied by the closing credits (for NBC&#x27;s original airings, the generic credits were used when NBC started doing this in the 1994–1995 season as well), though some episodes from seasons 6–8, including the series finale, used the standard closing sequence from seasons 1–5 (but with a slightly different font).

<text>A humidor is a humidity-controlled box or room used primarily for storing cigars, cigarettes, cannabis, or pipe tobacco. Either too much or too little humidity can be harmful to tobacco products; a humidor&#x27;s primary function is to maintain a steady, desirable moisture level inside; secondarily it protects its contents from physical damage and deterioration from sunlight. For private use, small wooden boxes holding a few dozen or fewer cigars are common, while cigar shops may have walk-in humidors. Many humidors use hygrometers to monitor their humidity levels. When used and maintained properly, humidors can keep cigars fresh and in perfect condition for decades. 

Another use for a humidor is controlling the moisture level in a baseball, which can have a pronounced effect on its response when hit with a baseball bat. This phenomenon was so great that in order to put an end to much controversy, in 2002, nine years after joining the league, the Colorado Rockies started storing their game balls in a large walk-in humidor at their home stadium, thus counteracting the effects of the low humidity due mainly to Denver&#x27;s famous mile-high altitude of around 5,280 feet above sea level. After the change, various offensive and defensive statistics at Rockies home games, especially the number of home runs, were found to be more in line with the rest of the league. In 2018 the Arizona Diamondbacks, whose Phoenix home field is affected by the arid Sonoran Desert climate, became the second Major League Baseball team to use a humidor.

==Types==
===Walk-in===
Most common in cigar bars or stores. One room is built as or converted to a humidor where all the cigars are stored.

===Cabinet===
Usually placed on the floor as a piece of furniture. It typically holds 1000–5000 cigars. A cabinet humidor is considered a good option for deep storage.

===Desktop===
The most common type of humidor. Typically box sized with lid on top or with one or more drawers. Vary in size from 25–500 cigars capacity. Zino Davidoff is credited as the inventor of the desktop humidor.

===Travel===
Portable, usually holding 2 to 20 cigars. Travel humidors must be especially durable and stand up to repeated openings.

===Cannabis===
Typically box sized that maintains 62% humidity level.

===Electric===
Similar to cabinet humidors, these are fully electronically controlled humidors and function similarly to a fridge.

==Construction==
Commercially made humidor cases are typically made of wood, although materials such as acrylic, glass, and metal are also used. Carbon fibre, silicon carbide, and polyethylene are rare. Aside from pleasing aesthetics, the casing&#x27;s purpose is to protect the interior and create a closed environment, so any durable and airtight material can be used.

The interior is typically a veneer of Spanish cedar, a traditional material which possesses several desirable characteristics for cigar storage:
# It holds more moisture than most woods, so it helps maintain humidity.
# It is not prone to warping or cupping in high humidity.
# It imparts its aroma to cigars. For the same reason, some cigars are wrapped in Spanish-cedar sheets before they are sold.
# It can repel tobacco beetles, pinhead-sized pests which can ruin entire stocks of cigars by eating the tobacco and laying eggs, causing further infestation. They can also be discouraged by ensuring the humidor does not get hotter than . The beetle eggs usually only hatch at around , although there are also instances where they will hatch at cooler temperatures if the humidity is too high.

Humidors are typically commercially produced, though most walk-ins are custom built and some humidors are homemade. They range considerably in material, size and complexity. Capacity is determined by deducting the space required for the humidification element and some extra room between the element and the cigars. It can also be calculated online for the most popular cigar formats.

==Maintenance==
A humidor needs to be seasoned when new or having been out of use for a while. Wood in an unseasoned humidor will absorb moisture from within, drying stored cigars out. The preferred technique for bringing the wood close to an optimal relative humidity level where it will buffer moisture is placing a small container of distilled water inside the humidor for 1 to 3 days.

===Humidity===
Some humidors contain a permanent humidifying system which keeps the air moist, which in turn keeps the cigars moist. Without a humidor, within two to three days, cigars will quickly lose moisture and level up with the general humidity around them. The ideal relative humidity in a humidor is around 68–72%. Though it can vary slightly depending on the cigar smoker&#x27;s preferences, it should never go higher than 75% due to the possibility of hatching tobacco beetles. The more empty space, the more readily the humidity level of the box will fluctuate.

Most humidifying elements are passive, releasing stored humidity through evaporation and diffusion. The use of a 50/50 solution of propylene glycol and distilled water is recommended for replenishing the passive humidifying element, as it has a buffering effect on air humidity, maintaining it at approximately 70%. Retailers and manufacturers claim propylene glycol also has mild antifungal and antibacterial properties; distilled water should always be used, due to its lack of minerals, additives, or bacteria.

Electronic humidifiers are also available, although usually reserved for very large humidors. A sensor measures the outside humidity and then activates a ventilator, which blows air over a humid sponge or water tank into the humidor. Once the preset humidity level has been reached the ventilator stops. This way electronic humidifiers can maintain a much more stable humidity level than passive humidifiers. Also they typically will activate an alarm to notify when the moisture supply needs refilling, to prevent humidity drops. The accuracy of electronic humidifiers depends primarily on the integrated type of sensor; the capacitive type are preferred.

Silica gel beads, familiar for removing moisture from packaging containers, are a third alternative. These are &quot;calibrated&quot; with a coating of mineral salts to absorb or release humidity in various RH ranges (including 65%, 68%, 70%, and 72%), providing a buffering effect on relative humidity. They require only distilled water when necessary, and can be ruined by propylene glycol.

Most humidors contain a hygrometer which is a device that can measure the humidity of the environment. Whether analogue or digital, these hygrometers can be used to measure the levels of humidity inside the humidor. Regardless, digital hygrometers tend to be more accurate when compared to the analogue ones.

===Temperature===
A humidor should never be exposed to direct sunlight. To discourage eggs of tobacco beetles from hatching and to prevent cigar rot, its internal temperature should be kept below , as well as below 75% relative humidity. At temperatures below , the desired ageing process of the cigars is impaired, making storage in wine cellars problematic.

<text>Arthur Norman Prior (4 December 1914 – 6 October 1969), usually cited as A. N. Prior, was a New Zealand–born logician and philosopher. Prior (1957) founded tense logic, now also known as temporal logic, and made important contributions to intensional logic, particularly in Prior (1971).

==Biography==
Prior was born in Masterton, New Zealand, on 4 December 1914, the only child of Australian-born parents: Norman Henry Prior (1882–1967) and his wife born Elizabeth Munton Rothesay Teague (1889–1914). His mother died less than three weeks after his birth and he was cared for by his father&#x27;s sister. His father, a medical practitioner in general practice, after war service at Gallipoli and in Francewhere he was awarded the Military Crossremarried in 1920. There were three more children: Elaine, the epidemiologist Ian Prior, and Owen. Arthur Prior grew up in a prominent Methodist household. His two Wesleyan grandfathers, the Reverends Samuel Fowler Prior and Hugh Henwood Teague, were sent from England to South Australia as missionaries in 1875. The Prior family first moved to New Zealand in 1893.

As the son of a doctor, Prior at first considered becoming a biologist, but ended up focusing on theology and philosophy, graduating from the University of Otago in 1935 with a B.A. in philosophy. While studying for his B.A., Prior attended the seminary at Dunedin&#x27;s Knox Theological Hall but decided against entering the Presbyterian ministry. John Findlay, Professor of Philosophy at Otago, first opened up the study of logic for Prior. In 1936, Prior married Clare Hunter, a freelance journalist, and they spent several years in Europe, during which they tried to earn a living as writers. Daunted by the prospect of an invasion of Britain, he and Clare returned to New Zealand in 1940.
At this point in his life he was a devout Presbyterian, though he became an atheist later in life.

After divorce from his first wife, he remarried in 1943 to Mary Wilkinson, with whom he would have two children. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force from 1943 to 1945 as a radio mechanic. Arthur and Mary kept their correspondence from the war and it is now a part of the Ann Prior Collection at the Bodleian Library. The correspondence is known as the Wartime letters, span more than several thousand pages and contain much important information about the development of Prior&#x27;s view on several philosophical and theological matters. Transcription of the letters are published at the Arthur Prior Digital Archive. 
After the war Prior embarking on an academic career at Canterbury University College in February 1946. His first position was a lectureship which had become available when Karl Popper left the university.

After returning to New Zealand following a year at Oxford as a visiting lecturer he took up a professorship in 1959 at Manchester University where he remained until he was elected a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford in 1966 and appointed a Reader. He continued his Manchester practice of accepting visiting professorships.

Arthur Prior went to give lectures at Norwegian universities in September 1969 and on 6 October 1969, the night before he was to deliver a lecture there, he died from a heart attack at Trondheim, Norway.

==Professional life==
Prior was educated entirely in New Zealand, where he was fortunate to have come under the influence of J. N. Findlay, under whom he wrote his M.A. thesis on &#x27;The Nature of Logic&#x27;. While Prior was very fond of the theology of Karl Barth, his early criticism of Barth&#x27;s adherence to Philosophical Idealism, is a mark of Findlay&#x27;s influence on Prior.

He began teaching philosophy and logic at Canterbury University College in February 1946, filling the vacancy created by Karl Popper&#x27;s resignation. In 1951 Prior met J. J. C. Smart, also known as &quot;Jack&quot; Smart, at a philosophical conference in Australia and the two developed a life-long friendship. Their correspondence was influential on Prior&#x27;s development of tense logic. Smart adhered to the tenseless theory of time and was never persuaded by Prior&#x27;s arguments, though Prior was influential in making Smart skeptical about Wittgenstein&#x27;s view on pseudo-relations. He became Professor in 1953. Thanks to the good offices of Gilbert Ryle, who had met Prior in New Zealand in 1954, Prior spent the year 1956 on leave at the University of Oxford, where he gave the John Locke lectures in philosophy. These were subsequently published as &quot;Time and Modality&quot; (1957). This is a seminal contribution to the study of tense logic and the metaphysics of time, in which Prior championed the A-theorist view that the temporal modalities of past, present and future are basic ontological categories of fundamental importance for our understanding of time and the world. Prior was several times warned by J. J. C. Smart against making tense-logic the topic of his John Locke lectures. Smart feared that tense-logic would get Prior &quot;involved in side issues, even straight philosophy, and not in the stuff that will do Oxford most good.&quot; Prior was however convinced that tense-logic had the potential to benefit logic, as well as philosophy, and thus he considered his lectures an &quot;expression of a conviction that formal logic and general philosophy have more to bring to one another than is sometimes supposed&quot;.

During his time at Oxford, Prior met Peter Geach and William Kneale, influenced John Lemmon, and corresponded with the adolescent Saul Kripke. Logic in the United Kingdom was then in a rather low state, being &quot;deeply out of fashion and its practitioners were isolated and somewhat demoralized.&quot; Prior arranged Logical a Colloquium which brought together such Logicians as John Lemmon, Peter Geach, Czesław Lejewski and more. The colloquiums were a great success and, together with Prior&#x27;s John Locke lecture and his visits around the country, he helped revitalize British logic. From 1959 to 1966, he was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Manchester, having taught Osmund Lewry. From 1966 until his death he was Fellow and Tutor in philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford. His students include Max Cresswell, Kit Fine, and Robert Bull.

Almost entirely self-taught in modern formal logic, Prior published four major papers on logic in 1952, when he was 38 years of age, shortly after discovering the work of Józef Maria Bocheński and Jan Łukasiewicz, despite very little of Łukasiewicz&#x27;s work being translated into English. He went so far as to read untranslated Polish texts without being able to speak Polish claiming &quot;the symbols are so illuminating that the fact that the text is incomprehensible doesn’t much matter&quot;. He went on to employ Polish notation throughout his career. Prior (1955) distills much of his early teaching of logic in New Zealand. Prior&#x27;s work on tense logic provides a systematic and extended defense of a tensed conception of reality in which propositional statements can change truth value over time.

Prior stood out by virtue of his strong interest in the history of logic. He was one of the first English-speaking logicians to appreciate the nature and scope of the logical work of Charles Sanders Peirce, and the distinction between &quot;de dicto&quot; and &quot;de re&quot; in modal logic. Prior taught and researched modal logic before Kripke proposed his possible worlds semantics for it, at a time when modality and intensionality commanded little interest in the English speaking world, and had even come under sharp attack by Willard Van Orman Quine.

He is now said to be the precursor of hybrid logic. Undertaking (in one section of his book &quot;Past, Present, and Future&quot; (1967)) the attempt to combine binary (e.g., &quot;until&quot;) and unary (e.g., &quot;will always be&quot;) temporal operators to one system of temporal logic, Prior—as an incidental result—builds a base for later hybrid languages.

His work &quot;Time and Modality&quot; explored the use of a many-valued logic to explain the problem of non-referring names.

Prior&#x27;s work was both philosophical and formal and provides a productive synergy between formal innovation and linguistic analysis. Natural language, he remarked, can embody folly and confusion as well as the wisdom of our ancestors. He was scrupulous in setting out the views of his adversaries, and provided many constructive suggestions about the formal development of alternative views.

He possessed an intellectual purity and a devotion to the subject that Iimmediately recognized and have always attempted to emulate (Kit Fine)

<text>Case modification, commonly referred to as case modding, is the modification of a computer case or a video game console chassis. Modifying a computer case in any non-standard way is considered a case mod. Modding is done, particularly by hardware enthusiasts, to show off a computer&#x27;s apparent power by showing off the internal hardware, and also to make it look aesthetically pleasing to the owner.

Cases may also be modified to improve a computer&#x27;s performance; this is usually associated with cooling and involves changes to components as well as the case.

==History==
When personal computers first became available to the public, the majority were produced in simple, beige-colored cases. This design is sometimes referred to be as a &quot;beige box&quot;. Although this met the purpose of containing the components of the personal computer, many users considered their computers as &quot;tacky&quot; or &quot;dull&quot;, and some began modifying their existing chassis, or building their own from scratch. One of the original case mods is the &quot;Macquarium&quot;, which consists of replacing the CRT screen in a Compact Macintosh case with a fishbowl.

A new market for third-party computer cases and accessories began to develop, and today cases are available in a wide variety of colors and styles. Today the business of &quot;modding&quot; computers and their cases is a hugely profitable endeavor, and bespoke DIY competitions are commonplace. Since 2017, computer hardware companies have started to offer some of their products with built-in RGB LED lighting, replacing earlier non-RGB LED (single color LED) lighting. Non-RGB LED lighting started to replace earlier CCFL-based (mixed with single color LEDs) lighting, starting in the late 2000s and early 2010s. RGB lighting may be integrated onto fans, liquid cooler pumps, RAM modules, or graphic card coolers, or they may be installed in the case itself as an RGB light strip. RGB lights may be controlled by the motherboard with an onboard lighting controller, or externally with a separate controller. They may also draw power directly from the power supply. Many cases now (as of 2019) come with side windows and RGB fans.

Peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and speakers are sometimes painted or otherwise modified to match the computer. Some system builders, in an effort to make their system more portable and convenient, install speakers and small screens into the case.

==== Case building ====
Sometime modders build entire cases from scratch. Some may attempt to treat the case as a work of art. Others make it look like or appear to be something else, like a teddy bear, wooden cabinet, a shelf mounted on a wall, or antique equipment such as a Macintosh Plus or an old Atari 2600 video game console. Relatively few case modders or builders make their computer cases from scratch; those who do sometimes put hundreds of hours into their work. The WMD case, Project Nighthawk, and Dark Blade case are a few examples of professional cases built from scratch.

==== Component modding ====
This type of modding, as the name suggests, involves modifying the PC components themselves for a perceived improvement in appearance. An example is the relocation of buttons on optical drives. This is often done in combination with &quot;stealthing&quot;, which hides the drive&#x27;s visibility by masking it with a blank face. A riskier modification is installing hard drive windows which show the platters and mechanism, which must be done in a clean room without significant dust. Few people have attempted it and results seem to vary. Some hard drives, including the WD Raptor, now come with a window as standard.
==== Window mods ====
This refers to a window placed within one of the panels of a computer case. This is most often done to the left hand side panel, and less often to the top panel. This modification is so popular that many of the major case manufacturers now offer cases with the windows pre-installed, or replaceable side panels with a window installed. Some companies even offer entire cases made out of transparent materials. A window kit may be modified to hold an LCD screen. Laser engraving can be done on acrylic windows to add a distinct look to a modded case.

==== Lighting mods ====
A lighting mod refers to lighting in or on the computer cases. This is usually achieved with cold cathode lights (CCLs), LED case fans, or electroluminescent wire lights. The lights are sometimes paired with sound controllers that make the lights pulse in time to sound. CCLs come in long tubes and produce heat. LEDs come in many sizes and forms, most often seen in bars similar to CCLs or within fans. Electroluminescent wire, which takes the form of a small light rope, is sometimes embedded in cables such as SATA cables. Lighting modifications are usually paired with window mods to help show off the components. As well, case fans, CPU heatsink fans, and power supplies themselves may feature lighting, thus enabling plug-and-play.

==== Paint mods ====
Painting a case is another method that case modders use to distinguish their system from others. Spray paint is the most common method preferred among amateur modders. There are many spray painting guides for amateur modders. This finish cannot be compared to automotive paint or powder coating , but it is a simple way to change the look of a case. Re-coloring the plastics of a case, keyboard, mouse and speakers with vinyl dye is another method that case modders use to highlight their own system, making them different from the rest. Vinyl dye has the advantages of ease of use like spray paint, but it is much more durable as it does not chip or scratch off. It also does not create a ‘layer’ like spray paint or similar.

==== Cable management ====
Routing cables, most often in computer cases, to be aesthetically pleasing is also a common practice in case modding. Similarly, covering the cables in a fabric, known as &quot;cable sleeving&quot; can also be undertaken to provide a more uniform look to the theme of the case.

==== Laptop modding ====
Laptops can be modified much like a typical computer case. While most laptop mods consist of new paint or other finishes, others have chosen to engrave or cut out designs into their laptop cover (usually behind the screen). Laptops may also be turned into digital photo frames. These types of mods will typically void the warranty of the device, as this requires opening up the computer to do them. To avoid warranty issues, skins or stickers can be purchased, which are easily removable from the casing.

===Function===

==== Cooling mods ====
Numerous modifications fall into this category, the simplest one being drilling a mount for a new fan, or removing a restrictive fan grill. Others include air ducts, water cooling, filtering, sealing openings to make airflow over hot components instead of escaping near where it entered, or even the adding of a tank of pressurized carbon dioxide or liters of mineral oil to the case. These modifications are often performed by overclockers looking either for better cooling for particularly hot components and/or noise (sound) reduction. Some fan modifications are merely a show of technical modding skill or talent and have no functional purpose. Hardcore overclockers often install cooling systems for the sole purpose of achieving performance records. Such systems may include water cooling, phase change materials, thermoelectric/Peltiercoolers, and even liquid nitrogen.

==Less common modifications==
=== Automotive paint &amp; other finishes ===
Automotive paint refers to the paint typically seen on cars and trucks. This type of finish requires a compressed air source, such as an air compressor or tank, and a spray gun. It is more expensive than a finish using spray cans, but when done skillfully it can be better looking and much more durable. Other methods of painting can include powder coating which is highly durable though not quite as aesthetically pleasing to many modders as automotive paint. Electroplating can also be done on steel computer cases and parts. Aluminum cases can be plated or anodized as well, and processes are available to plate plastic cases. Plated coatings can range from a nickel to chrome and even gold. More elaborate finishes can be crafted by using a combination of techniques, such as chrome plating with a transparent color coat.

=== Body filler ===
Body filler (or Bondo) is a two-part putty often used to fix dents in automobiles. Case modders use it to fill and sculpt their own creations. When mixed with a paste catalyst the filler hardens in a short period of time and can be sanded, ground or cut to a desired shape. An alternative system uses fiberglass resin (catalyzed with liquid hardener) and either fiberglass cloth or mat to fill holes and form shapes. Lacquer based Spot Putty is often used to fill smaller imperfections before the application of primer. Typically, a case modder uses a combination of these materials to obtain the desired result. This method is usually used on the front plastic bezel of a computer case to give it a new look.

==Contests==
Many websites and companies feature contests for case modders, awarding prizes and accolades to the winners. Examples include bit-tech&#x27;s Mod of the Month and Mod of the Year competitions, while some of these contests are sponsored by computer enthusiast magazines, such as CPU magazine or Custom PC Magazine, both of which have monthly modding contests. Other contests are sometimes supported by computer parts manufacturers.

==Console case modding==
&quot;Console case modding&quot; refers to the modification of the case of a game console. The most common consoles to modify are the Xbox and Xbox 360, because there is much more room inside to customize them with items such as lights and fans. Moreover, the Xbox 360 requires additional cooling over the factory configuration to avoid overheating issues due to the use of the wrong type of lead-free solder, which was not capable of handling the temperature limits standard solder can. These consoles and their controllers are also relatively easy to take apart. For those who do not wish to scratch-build mods, there are several companies that sell transparent Xbox cases and various cooling/lighting equipment for them.

Console case modding started in the late 1980s when the NES and Sega Genesis, were released; many customers simply put pictures or stickers on them until the PlayStation was released. Many case modders started to change hardware, for example by altering them to play copied games (known as &#x27;chipping&#x27; the games console). The most common modification for the PlayStation was the &#x27;chipping&#x27; process (mentioned above). When the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 were released, many chipped them, styled them, and added additional cooling; some went as far as changing the hardware itself. When the Xbox and Xbox 360 were released, many modders personally customized them further, using neon lights, transparent cases, fans, and PC hard drives (as opposed to Xbox-branded drives). Many modders found that altering the interior of Xbox 360s was difficult due to absence of a power cable (normally in a PC, this cord attaches the hard disk drive to its motherboard). Despite shortcomings, modders also found a way to power neon lighting and other powered equipment by using the DVD-ROM power supply; however, due to insufficient power to the hard disk drive, it often caused freezing during disk access. Another common method for internal case modding uses the power outlet for the internal fan by splitting the cord with a &quot;Y&quot; connector. However, the most up to date modders will use power points under where the PSU (power supply) plugs in, which doesn&#x27;t diminish any (or very little) power from the console.

<doc id="308766" wikidata="Q584729" url="?curid=308766" title="Pericles, Prince of Tyre">
<text>Pericles, Prince of Tyre is a Jacobean play written at least in part by William Shakespeare and included in modern editions of his collected works despite questions over its authorship, as it was not included in the First Folio. It was published in 1609 as a quarto, was not included in Shakespeare&#x27;s collections of works until the third folio, and the main inspiration for the play was Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;. Various arguments support the theory that Shakespeare was the sole author of the play, notably in DelVecchio and Hammond&#x27;s Cambridge edition of the play, but modern editors generally agree that Shakespeare was responsible for almost exactly half the play — 827 lines — the main portion after scene 9 that follows the story of Pericles and Marina. Modern textual studies suggest that the first two acts, 835 lines detailing the many voyages of Pericles, were written by a collaborator, who may well have been the victualler, panderer, dramatist and pamphleteer George Wilkins. Wilkins published &quot;The Painful Adventures of Pericles Prince of Tyre&quot; which is the prose version of the story, and drew from Lawrence Twines&#x27; &quot;The Pattern of Painful Adventures&quot;. &quot;Pericles&quot; was one of the seventeen plays that were in print during Shakespeare&#x27;s life, and was reprinted 5 times between 1609 and 1635.

==Synopsis==
John Gower introduces each act with a prologue. The play opens in the court of Antiochus, king of Antioch, who has offered the hand of his beautiful daughter to any man who answers his riddle; but those who fail shall die.

&lt;poem&gt;
I am no Viper, yet I feed
On mother&#x27;s flesh which did me breed:
I sought a husband, in which labour,
I found that kindness in a father;
He&#x27;s father, son, and husband mild,
I mother, wife; and yet his child:
How they may be, and yet in two,
As you will live resolve it you.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Pericles, the young Prince (ruler) of Tyre in Phoenicia (Lebanon), hears the riddle, and instantly understands its meaning: Antiochus is engaged in an incestuous relationship with his daughter. If he answers incorrectly, he will be killed, but if he reveals the truth, he will be killed anyway. Pericles hints that he knows the answer, and asks for more time to think. Antiochus grants him forty days, and then sends an assassin after him. However, Pericles has fled the city in disgust.

Pericles returns to Tyre, where his trusted friend and counsellor Helicanus advises him to leave the city, for Antiochus surely will hunt him down. Pericles leaves Helicanus as regent and sails to Tarsus, a city beset by famine. The generous Pericles gives the governor of the city, Cleon, and his wife Dionyza, grain from his ship to save their people. The famine ends, and after being thanked profusely by Cleon and Dionyza, Pericles continues on.

A storm wrecks Pericles&#x27; ship and washes him up on the shores of Pentapolis. He is rescued by a group of poor fishermen who inform him that Simonides, King of Pentapolis, is holding a tournament the next day and that the winner will receive the hand of his daughter Thaisa in marriage. Fortunately, one of the fishermen drags Pericles&#x27; suit of armour on shore that very moment, and the prince decides to enter the tournament. Although his equipment is rusty, Pericles wins the tournament and the hand of Thaisa (who is deeply attracted to him) in marriage. Simonides initially expresses doubt about the union, but soon comes to like Pericles and allows them to wed.

A letter sent by the noblemen reaches Pericles in Pentapolis, who decides to return to Tyre with the pregnant Thaisa. Again, a storm arises while at sea, and Thaisa appears to die giving birth to her child, Marina. The sailors insist that Thaisa&#x27;s body be set overboard in order to calm the storm. Pericles grudgingly agrees, and decides to stop at Tarsus because he fears that Marina may not survive the storm.

Luckily, Thaisa&#x27;s casket washes ashore at Ephesus near the residence of Lord Cerimon, a physician who revives her. Thinking that Pericles died in the storm, Thaisa becomes a priestess in the temple of Diana.

Pericles departs to rule Tyre, leaving Marina in the care of Cleon and Dionyza.

Marina grows up more beautiful than Philoten the daughter of Cleon and Dionyza, so Dionyza plans Marina&#x27;s murder. The plan is thwarted when pirates kidnap Marina and then sell her to a brothel in Mytilene. There, Marina manages to keep her virginity by convincing the men that they should seek virtue. Worried that she is ruining their market, the brothel rents her out as a tutor to respectable young ladies. She becomes famous for music and other decorous entertainments.

Meanwhile, Pericles returns to Tarsus for his daughter. The governor and his wife claim she has died; in grief, he takes to the sea.

Pericles&#x27; wanderings bring him to Mytilene where the governor Lysimachus, seeking to cheer him up, brings in Marina. They compare their sad stories and joyfully realise they are father and daughter. Next, the goddess Diana appears in a dream to Pericles, and tells him to come to the temple where he finds Thaisa. The wicked Cleon and Dionyza are killed when their people revolt against their crime. Lysimachus will marry Marina.

==Sources==
The play draws upon two sources for the plot. The first is &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; (1393) of John Gower, an English poet and contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer. This provides the story of Apollonius of Tyre. The second source is the Lawrence Twine prose version of Gower&#x27;s tale, &quot;The Pattern of Painful Adventures&quot;, dating from c. 1576, reprinted in 1607.

A third related work is &quot;The Painful Adventures of Pericles&quot; by George Wilkins, published in 1608. But this seems to be a &quot;novelization&quot; of the play, stitched together with bits from Twine; Wilkins mentions the play in the Argument to his version of the story – so that Wilkins&#x27; novel derives from the play, not the play from the novel. Wilkins, who with Shakespeare was a witness in the Bellott v. Mountjoy lawsuit of 1612, has been an obvious candidate for the author of the non-Shakespearean matter in the play&#x27;s first two acts; Wilkins wrote plays very similar in style, and no better candidate has been found.

The choruses spoken by Gower were influenced by Barnabe Barnes&#x27;s &quot;The Diuils Charter&quot; (1607) and by &quot;The Trauailes of the Three English Brothers&quot; (1607), by John Day, William Rowley, and Wilkins.

==Date and text==
Most scholars support 1607 or early 1608 as most likely, which accords well with what is known about the play&#x27;s likely co-author, George Wilkins, whose extant literary career seems to span only three years, 1606 to 1608. The only published text of &quot;Pericles&quot;, the 1609 quarto (all subsequent quartos were reprints of the original), is manifestly corrupt; it is often clumsily written and incomprehensible and has been interpreted as a pirated text reconstructed from memory by someone who witnessed the play (much like theories surrounding the 1603 &quot;bad quarto&quot; of &quot;Hamlet&quot;). The play was printed in quarto twice in 1609 by the stationer Henry Gosson. Subsequent quarto printings appeared in 1611, 1619, 1630, and 1635; it was one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most popular plays in his own historical era. The play was not included in the First Folio in 1623; it was one of seven plays added to the original Folio thirty-six in the second impression of the Third Folio in 1664. [See: Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare).] William Jaggard included &quot;Pericles&quot; in his 1619 False Folio.

The editors of the Oxford and Arden editions of &quot;Pericles&quot; accept Wilkins as Shakespeare&#x27;s collaborator, citing stylistic links between the play and Wilkins&#x27;s style that are found nowhere else in Shakespeare. The Cambridge editors reject this contention, arguing that the play is entirely by Shakespeare and that all the oddities can be defended as a deliberately old-fashioned style; however, they do not discuss the stylistic links with Wilkins&#x27;s work or any of the scholarly papers demonstrating contrary opinions. If the play was co-written or revised by Wilkins, this would support a later date, as it is believed Wilkins&#x27; career as a writer spanned only the years 1606-8. The 1986 Oxford University Press edition of the &quot;Complete Works&quot; and the subsequent individual edition include a &quot;reconstructed text&quot; of &quot;Pericles&quot;, which adapts passages from Wilkins&#x27; novel on the assumption that they are based on the play and record the dialogue more accurately than the quarto.

The play has been recognised as a probable collaboration since 1709, if not earlier. In that year Nicholas Rowe wrote, &quot;there is good Reason to believe that the greatest part of that Play was not written by him; tho&#x27; it is own&#x27;d, some part of it certainly was, particularly the last Act.&quot; Rowe here seems to be summarising what he believes to be a consensus view in his day, although some critics thought it was either an early Shakespeare work or not written by him at all. Wilkins has been proposed as the co-author since 1868. In 1919, H. Dugdale Sykes published a detailed comparison of numerous parallels between the first half of Pericles and four of Wilkins&#x27;s works, but he thought that Wilkins&#x27;s novelisation of the play preceded its composition. Many other scholars followed Sykes in his identification of Wilkins, most notably Jonathan Hope in 1994 and MacDonald P. Jackson in 1993 and 2003. In 2002, Prof. Brian Vickers summarised the historical evidence and took the Cambridge editors to task for ignoring more than a century of scholarship.

==Analysis and criticism==
Critical response to the play has traditionally been mixed. In 1629, Ben Jonson lamented the audiences&#x27; enthusiastic responses to the play:

&lt;poem&gt;
No doubt some mouldy tale,
Like Pericles; and stale
As the Shrieve&#x27;s crusts, and nasty as his fish—
Scraps out of every dish
Throwne forth, and rak&#x27;t into the common tub (Ben Jonson, &quot;Ode (to Himself)&quot;)
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1660, at the start of the Restoration when the theatres had just re-opened, Thomas Betterton played the title role in a new production of &quot;Pericles&quot; at the Cockpit Theatre, the first production of any of Shakespeare&#x27;s works in the new era.

After Jonson and until the mid-twentieth century, critics found little to like or praise in the play. For example,
nineteenth-century scholar Edward Dowden wrestled with the text and found that the play &quot;as a whole is singularly undramatic&quot; and &quot;entirely lacks unity of action.&quot; The episodic nature of the play combined with the Act Four&#x27;s lewdness troubled Dowden because these traits problematised his idea of Shakespeare. Dowden also banished &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; from the canon because it belonged to &quot;the pre-Shakespearean school of bloody dramas&quot;.

T. S. Eliot found more to admire, saying of the moment of Pericles&#x27; reunion with his daughter: &quot;To my mind the finest of all the &#x27;recognition scenes&#x27; is Act V, sc. i of that very great play &quot;Pericles&quot;. It is a perfect example of the &#x27;ultra-dramatic&#x27;, a dramatic action of beings who are more than human... or rather, seen in a light more than that of day.&quot;

The New Bibliographers of the early twentieth century Alfred W. Pollard, Walter Wilson Greg, and R. B. McKerrow
gave increased attention to the examination of quarto editions of Shakespearean plays published before the First Folio (1623). &quot;Pericles&quot; was among the most notorious &quot;bad quartos&quot;. In the second half of the twentieth century, critics began to warm to the play. After John Arthos&#x27; 1953 article &quot;&quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;: A Study in the Dramatic Use of Romantic Narrative,&quot; scholars began to find merits and interesting facets within the play&#x27;s dramaturgy, narrative and use of the marvelous. And, while the play&#x27;s textual critics have sharply disagreed about editorial methodology in the last half-century, almost all of them, beginning with F. D. Hoeniger with his 1963 &quot;Arden 2&quot; edition, have been enthusiastic about &quot;Pericles&quot;. (Other, more recent, critics have been Stephen Orgel (&quot;Pelican Shakespeare&quot;), Suzanne Gossett (&quot;Arden 3&quot;), Roger Warren (&quot;Reconstructed Oxford&quot;), and Doreen DelVecchio and Antony Hammond (&quot;Cambridge&quot;)).

Harold Bloom said that the play works well on the stage despite its problems, and even wrote, &quot;Perhaps because he declined to compose the first two acts, Shakespeare compensated by making the remaining three acts into his most radical theatrical experiment since the mature &quot;Hamlet&quot; of 1600–1601.&quot;

==Performance history==
The Venetian ambassador to England Zorzi Giustinian and the French diplomat Antoine Lefèvre de la Boderie saw a play titled &quot;Pericles&quot;. Giustinian was in London from 5 January 1606 to 23 November 1608. As far as is known, there was no other play with the same title that was acted in this era; the usual assumption is that this must have been Shakespeare&#x27;s play. The title page of the play&#x27;s first printed edition states that the play was often acted at the Globe Theatre, which was most likely true.

The earliest performance of &quot;Pericles&quot; known with certainty occurred in May 1619, at Court, &quot;in the King&#x27;s great chamber&quot; at Whitehall. The play was also performed at the Globe Theatre on 10 June 1631. A play called &quot;Pericles&quot; was in the repertory of a recusant group of itinerant players arrested for performing a religious play at Goulthwaite Hall in Yorkshire in 1609; however, it is not clear if they performed &quot;Pericles&quot;, or if theirs was Shakespeare&#x27;s play.

John Rhodes staged &quot;Pericles&quot; at the Cockpit Theatre soon after the theatres re-opened in 1660; it was one of the earliest productions, and the first Shakespearean revival, of the Restoration period. Thomas Betterton made his stage debut in the title role. Yet the play&#x27;s pseudo-naive structure placed it at odds with the neoclassical tastes of the Restoration era. It vanished from the stage for nearly two centuries, until Samuel Phelps staged a production at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in Clerkenwell in 1854. Phelps cut Gower entirely, satisfying his narrative role with new scenes, conversations between unnamed gentlemen like those in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, 5.2. In accordance with Victorian notions of decorum, the play&#x27;s frank treatment of incest and prostitution was muted or removed.

Walter Nugent Monck revived the play in 1929 at his Maddermarket Theatre in Norwich, cutting the first act. This production was revived at Stratford after the war, with Paul Scofield in the title role.

=== Modern revivals ===
The play has risen somewhat in popularity since Monck, though it remains extraordinarily difficult to stage effectively, an aspect played with in &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot; (filmed 1957–1960).
* In 1958, Tony Richardson directed the play at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford. The scene design, by Loudon Sainthill, unified the play; the stage was dominated by a large ship in which Gower related the tale to a group of sailors. Geraldine McEwan played Marina; Richard Johnson was Pericles; and Mark Dignam was Simonides. Angela Baddeley was the Bawd. The production was a success; it was later viewed as a model for &quot;coherent&quot; or thematically unified approaches, in contrast to the postmodern or disintegrative approaches of the seventies and eighties.

* The 1969 production by Terry Hands at Stratford also received favourable reviews. The set was almost bare, with a hanging replica of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Vitruvian Man above a bare stage. Hands also introduced extensive doubling, which has since become a staple of productions of this play. Emrys James played Gower (as a Welsh bard) and Helicanus. Susan Fleetwood doubled Thaisa and Marina (with Susan Sheers playing Marina when the two characters appear together in the final scene). Ian Richardson played the title role. For the performances on the nights of the Apollo landing, Hands added a special acknowledgment of the event to Gower&#x27;s lines.

* Ron Daniels directed the play in 1979 at The Other Place, an unlikely venue for such an expansive play. Daniels compensated for the lack of space by canny use of lighting and offstage music and sound effects. Peter McEnery played Pericles; Julie Peasgood was Marina. Griffith Jones was Gower.

* The play was among those adapted for the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; series and was first transmitted on 8 December 1984. The play was opened out so as to deal with the various locations and time intervals and was given a thoughtful and moving interpretation. Mike Gwilym played Pericles, Amanda Redman was Marina and Juliet Stevenson was Thaisa. It was directed by David Jones.

* In 1989, David Thacker directed the play at the Swan. The production was centred on a grid-covered trap suspended in air; the brothel scenes were played below, as in a basement; the shipboard scenes were played on and around the grid. Rudolph Walker was Gower, dressed as a bureaucrat; Nigel Terry played Pericles, and Suzan Sylvester and Sally Edwards were Marina and Thaisa, respectively.

* Productions in the 1990s differed from earlier productions in that they generally stressed the dislocation and diversity inherent in the play&#x27;s setting, rather than striving for thematic and tonal coherence. As early as 1983, Peter Sellars directed a production in Boston that featured extras dressed as contemporary American homeless people; devices such as these dominated English main stages in the nineties. Phyllida Lloyd directed the play at the Royal National Theatre in 1994. The production used extensive doubling. Kathryn Hunter played Antiochus, Cerimon, and the Bawd. The production made extensive use of the mechanised wheel in the theatre to emphasise movement in time and space; however, the wheel&#x27;s noise made some scenes difficult to hear, and some critics disparaged what they saw as pointless gimmickry in the staging.

* Adrian Noble&#x27;s 2002 production at the Roundhouse (his last before leaving the RSC) stressed diversity in another way. Responding to critical interest in Orientalism, Noble accentuated the multicultural aspects of the play&#x27;s setting. Ray Fearon took the title role to Lauren Ward&#x27;s Thaisa; Kananu Kirimi played Marina. Brian Protheroe was Gower. In an echo of the music played during the interval of the 1619 Whitehall performance, Noble featured belly dancing and drumming during the intermission of his production.

* Mary Zimmerman directed Pericles at Washington D.C.&#x27;s Shakespeare Theatre Company for their 2004–05 Season. The production transferred to Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre in 2006.

* The Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey mounted the play in two separate productions in their annual Shakespeare in the Parks series, directed by Jon Ciccarelli (2006) and Noelle Fair (2014) respectively. Both directors noted the 2002 Adrian Noble production as a direct influence on their productions utilizing diversely ethnic casts and set in Mediterranean locales. Ciccarelli&#x27;s production took a more historical and literary slant on the story using Gower as a direct story teller of the action in medieval costume vs. the Greek/Turkish garb of the main cast. Fair&#x27;s production took a more dream like approach using a variety of international music and devised movement pieces to convey the Gower dialogue.

* Joseph Haj directed several productions of &quot;Pericles&quot; from 2008 to 2016: at the PlayMakers Repertory Company in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in 2008; at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2015; and at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 2016—his inaugural production as artistic director of that institution.

* The 2015 Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe production directed by Dominic Dromgoole used a minimal set within the tiny, candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. Sheila Reid played Gower and James Garnon played Pericles. The production was noted for its humor.
* Cesear&#x27;s Forum, Cleveland&#x27;s minimalist theatre company at Playhouse Square, deconstructed the play in an adaptation entitled &quot;Perhaps, Pericles.&quot; Four actors in search of Shakespeare was the nub of this 2013 production.

* There have been four important productions of &quot;Pericles&quot; mounted at The Stratford Festival in Stratford, Canada. In 1973 there was a production directed by Jean Gascon that was repeated in 1974; there were later productions, respectively in 1986, 2003, and the latest in 2015. Both the 1973 and 1974 productions had the same cast, headed by Stratford stars, Nicholas Pennel and Martha Henry; the 1986 production was directed by Richard Ouzounian and starred Geraint Wyn Davies and Goldie Semple; the 2003 production was directed by Leon Rubin and starred Jonathan Goad; and in 2015 the director was Scott Wentworth and starred Evan Buliung. The 2015 production was filmed by CBC Television for the Shakespearean film series &quot;CBC Presents the Stratford Festival&quot;.

* The Theatre for a New Audience in New York City staged a production in early 2016 directed by Trevor Nunn with Christian Camargo as Pericles. Nunn utilized a generally bare stage but with more elaborate and ornate costuming from different eras and cultures. Nunn shifted some scenes around and brought in prose text from George Wilkins&#x27; Pericles story (thought to be the co-author of this play with Shakespeare) in order to improve the pace and clarity of the story. The production included folk songs and dances interwoven throughout the play as was often done in the original Shakespeare productions.

* The 2016 Guthrie Theater production directed by Joseph Haj was a collaboration with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Unlike most scholars, Haj believes that the play was written entirely by Shakespeare, calling it &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;mature&quot;. Rather than an elaborate set, the play uses visual projections on a large screen; this is particularly effective for the shipwreck scene and the &quot;literal wall of water... coming right at you.&quot;. Musicians effectively set the mood, create tension, and underscore the theme.

* The BBC has broadcast two radio adaptations of the play: one in 2005 starring Tom Mannion as Pericles and one in 2017 with Willard White as Gower, Paapa Essiedu as Pericles and Adjoa Andoh as Dionyza/Lychorida.

* In August 2019, Dan Dawes directed a stripped back, multi-roling production of the play for the company Idle Discourse, which focused heavily on bold storytelling and physical comedy. The production initially ran at London&#x27;s Upstairs at the Gatehouse in Highgate before transferring to the Baroque Palace Theatre in the Palace of Valtice, Czech Republic, the following month. Tom Grace starred as Pericles, Adam Elms as Gower, and Lauren Cornelius as Marina.

* In 2020, members of Mary Baldwin University&#x27;s MFA company model performed the show as part of Fireside Shakespeare Company&#x27;s 2020-2021 season. Directed by Millie Koncelik, the show was a small-scale production in which five actors portrayed all the characters. Due to the restraints of the pandemic, the production was masked and socially distanced. As part of the show&#x27;s concept, each of the five actors in turn performed one of Gower&#x27;s choruses throughout the show.

* The Royal Shakespeare Company have completed a July-September 2024 run of &quot;Pericles&quot; at Stratford-Upon-Avon, and this production has gone on tour to Chicago Shakespeare Theater from 20 October to 08 December, 2024. The production is directed by Tamara Harvey with Alfred Enoch as Pericles.

<text>In the First Folio, the plays of William Shakespeare were grouped into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies; and modern scholars recognise a fourth category, &quot;romance&quot;, to describe the specific types of comedy that appear in Shakespeare&#x27;s later works.

==Plays==
This alphabetical list includes everything listed as a comedy in the First Folio of 1623, in addition to the two quarto plays (&quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; and &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;) which are not included in the Folio but generally recognised to be Shakespeare&#x27;s own. Plays marked with an asterisk (*) are now commonly referred to as the &quot;romances&quot;. Plays marked with two asterisks (**) are sometimes referred to as the &quot;problem plays&quot;.

<doc id="308774" wikidata="Q196465" url="?curid=308774" title="Exif">
<text>Exchangeable image file format (officially Exif, according to JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA specifications) is a standard that specifies formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. The specification uses the following existing encoding formats with the addition of specific metadata tags: JPEG lossy coding for compressed image files, TIFF Rev. 6.0 (RGB or YCbCr) for uncompressed image files, and RIFF WAV for audio files (linear PCM or ITU-T G.711 μ-law PCM for uncompressed audio data, and IMA-ADPCM for compressed audio data). It does not support JPEG 2000 or GIF encoded images.

This standard consists of the Exif image file specification and the Exif audio file specification.

==Background==
Exif is supported by almost all camera manufacturers.

The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum:
* Camera settings: This includes static information such as the camera model and make, and information that varies with each image such as orientation (rotation), aperture, shutter speed, focal length, metering mode, and ISO speed information
* Image metrics: Pixel dimensions, resolution, colorspace, and filesize
* Date and time information, digital cameras will record the current date and time and save this in the metadata
* Location information
* A thumbnail for previewing the picture on the camera&#x27;s LCD screen, in file managers, or in photo manipulation software
* Descriptions
* Copyright information

==Version history==
The Japan Electronic Industries Development Association (JEIDA) produced the initial definition of Exif. Version 2.1 of the specification is dated 12 June 1998. JEITA established Exif version 2.2 (a.k.a. &quot;Exif Print&quot;), dated 20 February 2002 and released in April 2002. Version 2.21 (with Adobe RGB support) is dated 11 July 2003, but was released in September 2003 following the release of DCF 2.0. Version 2.3 was released on 26 April 2010, and revised to 2.31 in July 2013 and revised to 2.32 on 17 May 2019, was jointly formulated by JEITA and CIPA. The latest version, 3.0, was released in May 2023, and brings, among other things, support for UTF-8 to allow text data in non-ASCII encoding.

==Technical==
The Exif tag structure is borrowed from TIFF files. On several image specific properties, there is a large overlap between the tags defined in the TIFF, Exif, TIFF/EP, and DCF standards. For descriptive metadata, there is an overlap between Exif, IPTC Information Interchange Model and XMP info, which also can be embedded in a JPEG file. The Metadata Working Group has guidelines on mapping tags between these standards.

When Exif is employed for JPEG files, the Exif data are stored in one of JPEG&#x27;s defined utility &quot;Application Segments&quot;, the APP1 (segment marker 0xFFE1), which in effect holds an entire TIFF file within. When Exif is employed in TIFF files (also when used as &quot;an embedded TIFF file&quot; mentioned earlier), the TIFF Private Tag 0x8769 defines a sub-Image File Directory (IFD) that holds the Exif specified TIFF Tags. In addition, Exif also defines a Global Positioning System sub-IFD using the TIFF Private Tag 0x8825, holding location information, and an &quot;Interoperability IFD&quot; specified within the Exif sub-IFD, using the Exif tag 0xA005.

Formats specified in Exif standard are defined as folder structures that are based on Exif-JPEG and recording formats for memory. When these formats are used as Exif/DCF files together with the DCF specification (for better interoperability among devices of different types), their scope shall cover devices, recording media, and application software that handle them.

==Geolocation==

The Exif format has standard tags for location information. , many cameras and mobile phones have a built-in GPS receiver that stores the location information in the Exif header when a picture is taken. Some other cameras have a separate GPS receiver that fits into the flash connector or hot shoe. Recorded GPS data can also be added to any digital photograph on a computer, either by correlating the time stamps of the photographs with a GPS record from a hand-held GPS receiver or manually by using a map or mapping software. Some cameras can be paired with cellphones to provide the geolocation. The process of adding geographic information to a photograph is known as geotagging. Photo-sharing communities like Panoramio, locr or Flickr equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online.

==Program support==
Exif data are embedded within the image file itself. While many recent image manipulation programs recognize and preserve Exif data when writing to a modified image, this is not the case for most older programs. Many image gallery programs also recognise Exif data and optionally display it alongside the images.

Software libraries, such as libexif for C and Adobe XMP Toolkit or Exiv2 for C++, Metadata Extractor for Java, PIL/Pillow for Python, LEADTOOLS or ExifTool for Perl, parse Exif data from files and read/write Exif tag values.

==Problems==

===Technical===
The Exif format has a number of drawbacks, mostly relating to its use of legacy file structures.

* The derivation of Exif from the TIFF file structure using offset pointers in the files means that data can be spread anywhere within a file, which means that software is likely to corrupt any pointers or corresponding data that it does not decode/encode. For this reason most image editors damage or remove the Exif metadata to some extent upon saving.
* The standard defines a MakerNote tag, which allows camera manufacturers to place any custom format metadata in the file. This is used increasingly by camera manufacturers to store camera settings not listed in the Exif standard, such as shooting modes, post-processing settings, serial number, focusing modes, etc. As the tag contents are proprietary and manufacturer-specific, it can be difficult to retrieve this information from an image or to properly preserve it when rewriting an image. Manufacturers can encrypt portions of the information; for example, some Nikon cameras encrypt the detailed lens data in the MakerNote data.
* Exif is very often used in images created by scanners, but the standard makes no provisions for any scanner-specific information.
* Photo manipulation software sometimes fails to update the embedded thumbnail after an editing operation, possibly causing the user to inadvertently publish compromising information. For example, someone might blank out a licence registration plate of a car (for privacy concerns), only to have the thumbnail not so updated, meaning the information is still visible.
* Exif metadata are restricted in size to 64 kB in JPEG images because according to the specification this information must be contained within a single JPEG APP1 segment. Although the FlashPix extensions allow information to span multiple JPEG APP2 segments, these extensions are not commonly used. This has prompted some camera manufacturers to develop non-standard techniques for storing the large preview images used by some digital cameras for LCD review. These non-standard extensions are commonly lost if a user re-saves the image using image editor software, possibly rendering the image incompatible with the original camera that created it. (In 2009, CIPA released the Multi Picture Object specification which addresses this deficiency and provides a standard way to store large previews in JPEG images.)
* There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information has been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are: &quot;OffsetTime&quot;, &quot;OffsetTimeOriginal&quot; and &quot;OffsetTimeDigitized&quot;.
* There is no standard field to record readouts of a camera&#x27;s accelerometers or inertial navigation system. Such data could help to establish the relationship between the image sensor&#x27;s XYZ coordinate system and the gravity vector (i.e., which way is down in this image). It could also establish relative camera positions or orientations in a sequence of photos. Some software records this information using the GPSImgDirection tag along with custom GPSPitch and GPSRoll tags.
* The XResolution and YResolution tags provide the number of pixels per length unit for the width and height of the image, respectively. (The length unit itself is specified by the tag ResolutionUnit.) By default, these tags in combination are set to 72 pixels per inch (ppi). These tags were inherited from the TIFF 6.0 standard and are required even though for images produced by digital cameras, image resolution values such as ppi are meaningless.

===Privacy and security===

Since the Exif tag contains metadata about the photo, it can pose a privacy problem. For example, a photo taken with a GPS-enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken, and the unique ID number of the device - this is all done by default - often without the user&#x27;s knowledge. Many users may be unaware that their photos are tagged by default in this manner, or that specialist software may be required to remove the Exif tag before publishing. For example, a whistleblower, journalist or political dissident relying on the protection of anonymity to allow them to report malfeasance by a corporate entity, criminal, or government may therefore find their safety compromised by this default data collection.

In December 2012, anti-virus businessman John McAfee was arrested in Guatemala while fleeing from alleged persecution in neighboring Belize. &quot;Vice&quot; magazine had published an exclusive interview on their website with McAfee &quot;on the run&quot; that included a photo of McAfee with a &quot;Vice&quot; reporter taken with a phone that had geotagged the image. The photo&#x27;s metadata included GPS coordinates locating McAfee in Guatemala, and he was captured two days later. McAfee later claimed to have edited the Exif data from his phone to provide a false location.

According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the NSA is targeting Exif information under the XKeyscore program.

The privacy problem of Exif data can be avoided by removing the Exif data using a metadata removal tool.

==Related standards==

Metadata Working Group was formed by a consortium of companies in 2006 (according to their web page) or 2007 (as stated in their own press release). Version 2.0 of the specification was released in November 2010, giving recommendations concerning the use of Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata in images.

Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) is an ISO standard, originally created by Adobe Systems Inc., for the creation, processing and interchange of standardized and custom metadata for digital documents and data sets. IPTC was developed in the early 1990s by the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) to expedite the international exchange of news among newspapers and news agencies.

==Exif fields==
Not all devices use every available metadata field in the Exif standard.

===Example===

The following table shows Exif metadata for a photo made with a typical digital camera. Authorship and copyright information is generally not provided in the camera&#x27;s output, so it must be filled in during later stages of processing. Some programs, such as Canon&#x27;s Digital Photo Professional, allow the name of the owner to be added to the camera itself.

===Time Tags===
In addition to the basic date and time tags (codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3), there are three corresponding &quot;subsecond&quot; tags: codice_4, codice_5, and codice_6. The codice_4 tag is defined in version 2.3 as &quot;a tag used to record fractions of seconds for the DateTime tag;&quot; the codice_5 and codice_6 fields are defined similarly. The subsecond tags are of variable length, meaning manufacturers may choose the number of ASCII-encoded decimal digits to place in these tags. For codice_10, the actual time with various subsecond values would be: 
* codice_11: codice_12
* codice_13: codice_14
* codice_15: codice_16
* codice_17: codice_18
The standard does not specify which particular event during the &quot;taking&quot; of a picture the time tags should describe. The standard is, in fact, ambiguous. The codice_2 tag is defined as &quot;The date and time when the original image data was generated.&quot; For an exposure—say, 30 seconds—longer than the granularity of the timestamp (one second for the codice_2 tag), the tag&#x27;s time could correspond to the beginning of the exposure, the end of the exposure, or some other time. This confusion is exacerbated for the subsecond tags, where the granularity (down to 1/10000th of a second in the examples in the standard) is shorter than many common exposure durations. 

As noted above, tags to specify the previously-missing timezone information were added in Exif version 2.31. These are &quot;OffsetTime&quot;, &quot;OffsetTimeOriginal&quot; and &quot;OffsetTimeDigitized&quot;. They are formatted as seven ASCII characters (including the null terminator) denoting the hours and minutes of the offset, like codice_21 or codice_22. The offset is &quot;from UTC (the time difference from Universal Coordinated Time including daylight saving time) of the time of&quot; the matching tag.

==FlashPix extensions==
The Exif specification also includes a description of FPXR (FlashPix-ready) information, which may be stored in APP2 of JPEG images using a structure similar to that of a FlashPix file. These FlashPix extensions allow meta-information to be preserved when converting between FPXR JPEG images and FlashPix images. FPXR information may be found in images from some models of digital cameras by Kodak and Hewlett-Packard. Below is an example of the FPXR information found in a JPEG image from a Kodak EasyShare V570 digital camera:

==Exif audio files==
The Exif specification describes the RIFF file format used for WAV audio files and defines a number of tags for storing meta-information such as artist, copyright, creation date, and more in these files. The following table gives an example of Exif information found in a WAV file written by the Pentax Optio WP digital camera:

==MakerNote data==
The &quot;MakerNote&quot; tag contains image information normally in a proprietary binary format. Some of these manufacturer-specific formats have been decoded:
* OZHiker (not updated since 2008): Agfa, Canon, Casio, Epson, Fujifilm, Konica/Minolta, Kyocera/Contax, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax/Asahi, Ricoh, Sony
* Kamisaka (not updated since 2007): Canon, Casio, FujiFilm, ISL, KDDI, Konica/Minolta, Mamiya, Nikon, Panasonic, Pentax, Ricoh, Sigma, Sony, WWL
* X3F Info: Sigma/Foveon
* ExifTool: Canon, Casio, FujiFilm, GE, HP, JVC/Victor, Kodak, Leaf, Minolta/Konica-Minolta, Nikon, Olympus/Epson, Panasonic/Leica, Pentax/Asahi, Reconyx, Ricoh, Samsung, Sanyo, Sigma/Foveon, Sony, etc.
* Olypedia: Olympus

The proprietary formats used by many manufacturers break if the MakerNote tag data is moved (i.e. by inserting or editing a tag that precedes it). The reason to edit to the Exif data could be as simple as to add copyright information, an Exif comment, etc. There are two solutions for this problem:

* When the Exif data is saved, the MakerNote data is stored at the same place as before. 
* A special offset tag is added. This tag contains the information by how many bytes the MakerNote data was moved in comparison to the original index.

Microsoft has implemented the last solution in Windows 10: In the Windows explorer you can change the Exif data of an image file by the properties window. Here the tab sheet &quot;Details&quot; contains some Exif data like title, subject, comments etc. and these Exif data can also be changed and stored. When the image file is saved the tag &quot;OffsetSchema&quot; (tag ID = 0xea1d) is added and this tag contains a signed 32 bit number. With this number the original index of &quot;MakerNote&quot; can be restored:

Original index of &quot;MakerNote&quot; = Current index of &quot;MakerNote&quot; - Value of tag &quot;OffsetSchema&quot;

But the tag &quot;OffsetSchema&quot; was defined by Microsoft and it is not part of the official Exif standard.

In some cases, camera vendors also store important information only in proprietary makernote fields, instead of using available Exif standard tags. An example for this is Nikon&#x27;s ISO speed settings tag.

<doc id="308781" wikidata="Q268984" url="?curid=308781" title="President of Croatia">
<text>The president of Croatia, officially the president of the Republic of Croatia (), is the head of state, commander-in-chief of the military and chief representative of the Republic of Croatia both within the country and abroad. The president is the holder of the highest office in Croatia. However, the president is not the head of the executive branch (&quot;non executive president&quot;) as Croatia has a parliamentary system in which the holder of the post of prime minister is the most powerful person within the country&#x27;s constitutional framework and everyday politics.

The president maintains the regular and coordinated operation and stability of the national government system, and safeguards the independence and territorial integrity of the country. The president has the power to call ordinary and extraordinary elections for the Croatian Parliament (in a manner specified by the Constitution), as well as to call referendums (with countersignature of the prime minister). The president formally appoints the prime minister on the basis of the balance of power in parliament and consultations conducted with the leaders of parliamentary parties, grants pardons and awards decorations and other state awards. The president and Government (Cabinet) cooperate in conducting foreign policy. In addition, the president is the commander-in-chief of the Croatian Armed Forces. The president appoints the director of the Security and Intelligence Agency in agreement with the prime minister. The president may dissolve the Parliament under circumstances provided by the Constitution. Although enjoying immunity, the president is impeachable for violation of the Constitution. In case of a temporary or permanent incapability by the president to discharge the duties of office, the speaker of the Parliament assumes the office of acting president until the president resumes their duties, or until the election of a new president within 60 days of the permanent vacancy occurring.

The Office of the President of the Republic () consists of the immediate staff of the president of Croatia, as well as support staff reporting to the president. The office is located in the Presidential Palace in the Pantovčak area of Zagreb. The Constitution of Croatia defines the appearance and use of the presidential standard, which is flown on the buildings of the Office of the President, the residence of the president, any vehicles in use by the president, and in other ceremonial occasions.

The president is elected on the basis of universal suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a five-year term. If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of &quot;all&quot; votes cast (including blank and spoilt ballots), a runoff election is held. The Constitution of Croatia sets a limit of a maximum of two terms in office. The president-elect is required to take an oath of office before the judges of the Constitutional Court. Franjo Tuđman won the first Croatian presidential elections in 1992 and in 1997. During his time in office, the constitution adopted in 1990 provided for a semi-presidential system, which was in the coming years further strengthened by laws specifically aimed at providing Tuđman with sweeping powers (e.g. naming and dismissing numerous government officials, confirming county prefects), as his HDZ party held a supermajority in parliament throughout the 1990s. After his death in 1999, the constitution was amended and many presidential powers were transferred to parliament, to the prime minister and to his government. Stjepan Mesić won two consecutive terms, in 2000 and in 2005, and served as president until 2010. Ivo Josipović won the presidential election held from 2009 to 2010 and left office in 2015, after losing his reelection bid for a second term. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović won the election held in December 2014 and January 2015, but was defeated in her bid for a second term. Namely, on 5 January 2020 the centre-left former prime minister, Zoran Milanović, won the 2019–20 election in the second round and took office on 19 February 2020.

==List of office-holders==
This is a graphical timeline listing of the presidents of Croatia since the first multi-party elections in 1990.

==Powers, duties and responsibilities==

The president of Croatia, officially styled President of the Republic () represents the Republic of Croatia in the country and abroad as the head of state, maintains the regular and coordinated operation and stability of the national government system and safeguards the independence and territorial integrity of the country. The president is barred from executing any other public or professional duty while in office.

The president of Croatia calls elections for the Croatian Parliament () and convenes the first meeting of the parliamentary assembly. The president is also required to appoint a prime minister, on the basis of the balance of power in the parliament. The appointed candidate is in turn required to seek confirmation from the parliament through a confidence vote, to receive a mandate to lead the Croatian Government (after given confidence by the absolute majority of the MPs, the president formally appoints the candidate as Prime Minister, while PM appoints ministers; all with the countersignature of the speaker of the Croatian Parliament). The president may also call referendums, grant pardons and award decorations and other forms of recognition defined by legislation.

===Foreign affairs===

The president of Croatia and the Government cooperate in the formulation and implementation of Croatia&#x27;s foreign policy. This provision of the constitution is an occasional source of conflict between the president and the government. The president decides on the establishment of diplomatic missions and consular offices of the Republic of Croatia abroad, at the Government&#x27;s proposal and with the countersignature of the prime minister. The president, following prior countersignature of the prime minister, appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of the Republic of Croatia, at the proposal of the Government and upon receiving the opinion of an applicable committee of the parliament. The president receives letters of credence and letters of recall from foreign diplomatic representatives.

===National security and defense===
The president of Croatia is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Republic of Croatia and appoints and relieves military commanders of duty, esp. the chief of general staff, conforming to applicable legislation. The President confers ranks on (and promotes) commissioned officers and generals/admirals, upon minister&#x27;s proposal.

The president cooperates with the government directing operation of the Croatian security and intelligence system. The president and the prime minister jointly appoint heads of the security agencies, and the president may attend cabinet meetings, taking part in discussions held at such meetings. The president and the prime minister jointly convene Defense Council as well as the National Security Council; the president chairs these councils and their meetings.

The president of Croatia is supported in his defense and national security duties and responsibilities by the Military Cabinet (&quot;Vojni ured&quot;) as a part of the Office of the President, staffed by commissioned officers. The President works closely with the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces.

====War and state of emergency====
Pursuant to decisions of the parliament, the president declares war and concludes peace. In cases of immediate threats to the independence, unity and existence of the state, the president may order the use of armed forces, even if no state of war is declared, provided that such an order is countersigned by the prime minister. During a state of war, the president may promulgate regulations with the force of law on the basis of, and within the scope of, authority obtained from the parliament. In such circumstances, the president may convene government cabinet meetings and preside over them. If the parliament is not in session, the president is authorized to regulate all matters required by the state of war through regulations carrying the force of law. In case of an immediate threat to the independence, unity and existence of the state, or if the governmental bodies are prevented from performing their constitutional duties regularly, the president may, at the proposal of the prime minister, issue regulations carrying the force of law. Such regulations must also be countersigned by the prime minister to become valid. The president is required to submit regulations that are promulgated thus to the parliament for approval as soon as the parliament may convene, otherwise the regulations become void.

===Dissolution of parliament===

The president of Croatia may dissolve Parliament upon the request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of no confidence or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the prime minister to become valid. The president may also dissolve Parliament after a motion of no confidence supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, the president may not dissolve Parliament at the request of the government if a procedure to determine if the president has violated provisions of the constitution is in progress.

==Office of the President==
The Office of the President of the Republic () consists of the immediate staff of the president of Croatia, as well as support staff reporting to the president. As of May 2008, the office employed 170 staff, with the maximum staffing level set at 191 by the Regulation on Internal Organisation of the Office of the President of Croatia. In 2009 government budget, the office was allocated 54 million kuna ( 7.3 million euro). The net monthly salary of the president is 23,500 kuna ( 3,170 euro).

The Office of the President was created by a presidential decree by Franjo Tuđman on 19 January 1991. The office is headed by a chief of staff (), who is appointed by the president. The presidents declare bylaws regulating composition of the office. The office employs advisors to the president and comprises eight departments, four councils, presidential pardon commission and two decorations and awards commissions.

===Presidential Palace===

The Presidential Palace (, also referred to by the metonym &quot;Pantovčak&quot;) in Zagreb is the official workplace of the president. The president does not actually live in the building, as it is used as the Office of the President of Croatia rather than as a residence. The structure covers . It had been used as the official residence since then-president Franjo Tuđman moved there following the October 1991 bombing of Banski dvori. In addition to the original building, there is also an annex built in 1993, an ancillary structure housing office security services and a bomb shelter predating the 1990s. The building, formerly known as &quot;Villa Zagorje&quot; or &quot;Tito&#x27;s Villa&quot;, was designed by architects Vjenceslav Richter and Kazimir Ostrogović and completed in 1964 for the former Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito.

==Election and taking office==


The president is elected on the basis of universal suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a five-year term. If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of the votes, a runoff election is held in 14 days. The Constitution of Croatia sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office and requires election dates to be determined within 30 to 60 days before the expiry of the term of the incumbent president. Any citizen of Croatia of 18 or over may be a candidate in a presidential election, provided that the candidate is endorsed by 10,000 voters. The endorsements are required in form of a list containing name, address, personal identification number and voter signature. The presidential elections are regulated by an act of the parliament.

The constitution requires that the president-elect resign from political party membership. The president-elect is also required to resign from the parliament as well. Before assuming presidential duty, the president-elect is required to take an oath of office before the judges of the Constitutional Court, swearing loyalty to the Constitution of Croatia. The inauguration ceremony is traditionally held at St. Mark&#x27;s Square in Zagreb, in front of the St. Mark&#x27;s Church, midway between the building of the Parliament of Croatia and Banski dvori—the seat of the Government of Croatia. The text of the oath is defined by the Presidential Elections Act amendments of 1997. The text in its Croatian form is not sensitive to gender and all nouns (e.g. &quot;Predsjednik&quot; (President), &quot;državni poglavar&quot; (head of state)) always retain their masculine form, even when the president being sworn in is a woman (as was the case with Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović in 2015). There is however a notation within the Constitution of Croatia which states that all nouns used within the text of the document apply equally to both genders. The text of the presidential oath of office is as follows:

===Presidential elections===

Presidential elections were held in Croatia for the first time on 2 August 1992, simultaneously with the 1992 parliamentary elections. Voter turnout was 74.9%. The result was a victory for Franjo Tuđman of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), who received 57.8% of the vote in the first round of the elections, ahead of 7 other candidates. Dražen Budiša, the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) candidate and runner-up in the election, received 22.3% of the vote. The second presidential elections in modern Croatia were held on 15 June 1997. The incumbent, Franjo Tuđman ran opposed by Zdravko Tomac, the candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), and Vlado Gotovac, nominated by the HSLS. Tomac and Gotovac received 21.0% and 17.6% of votes respectively in the first round of voting, and Tuđman secured another term. The third presidential elections were held on 24 January 2000, to fill the office of the President of the Republic, after the incumbent Franjo Tuđman died on 10 December 1999. The first round of voting saw Stjepan Mesić, candidate of the Croatian People&#x27;s Party (HNS) in the lead, receiving 41.3% of votes, followed by Dražen Budiša of the HSLS with 27.8% of votes and Mate Granić, nominated by the HDZ, receiving 22.6% of votes. The runoff election, the first in the presidential elections of modern Croatia, was held on 7 February, when Mesić won, picking up 56.9% of votes. Voter turnout in the first round was 63.0% and 60.9% in the runoff. The first round of the fourth presidential elections was held on 2 January 2005. No candidate secured a first-round victory; however, the incumbent Mesić enjoyed a substantial lead over other candidates, as he received 48.9% of votes, and the second and third ranked candidates Jadranka Kosor (HDZ) and Boris Mikšić (independent) managed only 20.3% and 17.8% of voter support respectively. Ultimately, Mesić won reelection, receiving 65.9% of votes in the runoff held on 16 January. The 2009–2010 presidential election was held on 27 December 2009, with Ivo Josipović (SDP) picking up 32.4% of votes, followed by Milan Bandić (independent), Andrija Hebrang (HDZ) and Nadan Vidošević (independent) receiving 14.8%, 12.0% and 11.3% of the votes respectively. The second round of voting was held on 10 January 2010, when Josipović defeated Bandić, receiving 60.3% of the vote. The first round of the most recent presidential election was held on 28 December 2014, where Josipović won 38.46% of the votes, followed by Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović (HDZ) who received 37.22% of ballots. The third was an independent candidate, Ivan Vilibor Sinčić who received 16.42% of votes, and Milan Kujundžić (Croatian Dawn – Party of the People) who was supported by 6.3% of the votes. The runoff was held on 11 January 2015, and Grabar-Kitarović won by a margin of approximately one percentage point.

===History===

The Socialist Republic of Croatia within SFR Yugoslavia was led by a group of communist party officials, who formed a collective Presidency with the president of the Presidency at its head. The first democratic elections of 1990 did not elect members of the Presidency directly. Rather, the parliament was tasked with filling these positions as it had done in the socialist period. The HDZ won the elections and its leader Tuđman assumed the presidency on 30 May 1990. On 25 July of the same year, the parliament passed several constitutional amendments, including amendment LXXI, which created the position of President and Vice-Presidents. The Christmas Constitution, passed on 22 December 1990, established the government as a semi-presidential system and called for presidential elections.

Tuđman won the presidential elections in 1992, and was inaugurated on 12 August 1992. He was reelected in 1997, and the Constitution of Croatia was amended the same year. After his death in 1999, the constitution was amended and much of the presidential powers were transferred to the parliament and the government, creating a parliamentary system. Mesić won two consecutive terms in 2000 on the HNS ticket and in 2005, the maximum term permitted by the constitution. Josipović, an SDP candidate, won the presidential elections held in 2009–2010. Grabar-Kitarović won the elections of 2014–15 and she was voted to become the first woman president of Croatia.

==Immunity and impeachment==
The President of Croatia enjoys immunity—the president may not be arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply is if the president has been caught in the act of committing a criminal offense, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for more than five years. In such a case the state body that has detained the president must notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.

The President of Croatia is impeachable for any violation of the Constitution committed in performance of duty. Impeachment proceedings may be initiated by the Parliament of Croatia by a two-thirds majority vote of all members of the parliament. The impeachment of the president is then decided by the Constitutional Court, by a two-thirds majority vote of all its judges. If the Constitutional Court impeaches the president, the president&#x27;s term is terminated.

==Vacancy or incapacity==

In the case of brief incapacitation to execute the office of the President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the president may transfer his powers to the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties for a longer period of time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.

In the case of death in office or resignation, submitted to the President of the Constitutional Court and communicated to the Speaker of the parliament, or in cases when the Constitutional Court decides to terminate the presidential term through impeachment, the Speaker of the parliament becomes acting president. In those circumstances, new legislation is countersigned by the prime minister instead of the president and a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. This situation occurred after the death of Franjo Tuđman (the only president to date to die in office) on 10 December 1999, when Vlatko Pavletić became the acting president. After the parliamentary elections of 2000, the role was transferred to Zlatko Tomčić, who filled the office until Stjepan Mesić was elected President of Croatia in 2000.

==Symbols==

Legislation defines the appearance and use of the presidential standard of Croatia as a symbol of the President of Croatia, and the appearance and use of the presidential sash as a symbol of honour of the office of the president. The presidential standard is a square, blue field with a thin border of alternating red and white squares on each side. In the centre of the blue field is the main shield depicts the Croatian checkerboard with five lozenge shields for the historical arms of Croatia surrounding the main shield. From left to right, these are the oldest known coats of arms of Croatia, the Republic of Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia, adorned with bands of gold, red and white stripes extending down vertically. Atop the shield there is a Croatian tricolour ribbon with golden letters &quot;RH&quot; that stand for the Republic of Croatia, executed in Roman square capitals. The presidential standard is flown on buildings of the Office of the President of Croatia, the residence of the president, transportation vehicles when in use by the president, and in other ceremonial occasions. The presidential standard was designed by Miroslav Šutej in 1990.

The presidential sash () is a Croatian tricolour band, trimmed with gold and adorned with the coat of arms of Croatia, which is placed in a white field, with the tricolour at the front. The arms are bordered by oak branches on the left and olive branches on the right (the initial version, however, featured only the shield of the coat of arms). The sash is worn diagonally, over the right shoulder, and is fastened using a square clasp trimmed with golden Croatian interlace. The sash is adorned with the arms used on the presidential standard, although without the ribbon used in the arms. The constitution specifies that the sash is worn on Statehood Day, during awards ceremonies, during the acceptance of letters of credence and in other ceremonial occasions. The presidential sash was not in use since the 2000 inauguration of Stjepan Mesić, but was revived in 2015 by Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović during her inauguration and her term in office.

==Post-presidency==
Former presidents of the Republic of Croatia are provided with an office and two staff members paid by the state once they leave the office. In addition, former presidents are assigned a driver, an official car and bodyguards. The government of Croatia is required to provide these benefits within 30 days following the end of the term of president, upon a president&#x27;s personal request. Stjepan Mesić&#x27;s office is located in Grškovićeva Street in Zagreb. The office employs a public-relations advisor and a foreign policy advisor. The office was established in 2010 and assigned an annual budget of 1.3 million kuna ( 175,000 euro). According to Mesić himself, his new office of the former president shall be at the disposal of Croatian companies to help them expand their market. Since the office has been established, former president Mesić also receives foreign diplomats and visits abroad where he meets officials and delivers lectures on occasion.

The rights of the former presidents are defined by a parliamentary Act enacted in 2004, during the first term of Stjepan Mesić. Before that act was enacted, the constitution provided that the former presidents shall become members of the Chambers of Counties of the Parliament of Croatia for life, unless otherwise requested by the president. This was never exercised in practice, since Franjo Tuđman died in office and the Chamber of Counties was abolished before the end of the first term of Stjepan Mesić.

<text>The College of Cardinals, more formally called the Sacred College of Cardinals, is the body of all cardinals of the Catholic Church. there are cardinals, of whom are eligible to vote in a conclave to elect a new pope. Cardinals are appointed by the pope for life but eligibility to vote ceases at the age of 80.

Since the emergence of the College of Cardinals in the Early Middle Ages, the size of the body has historically been limited by popes, ecumenical councils ratified by the pope, and even the college itself. The total number of cardinals from 1099 to 1986 has been about 2,900 (excluding possible undocumented 12th-century cardinals and pseudocardinals appointed during the Western Schism by pontiffs now considered to be antipopes, and subject to some other sources of uncertainty), nearly half of whom were created after 1655.

== History ==

The word &quot;cardinal&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;cardō&quot;, meaning &quot;hinge&quot;. The office of cardinal as it is known today slowly evolved during the first millennium from the clergy of Rome. &quot;The first time that the term &quot;cardinal&quot; appears in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; is in the biography of Pope Stephen III when in the Roman Synod of 769, it was decided that the Roman pontiff should be elected from among the deacons and cardinal priests.&quot;

In 845 the Council of Meaux–Paris &quot;required Bishops to establish Cardinal titles or parishes in their towns and outlining districts&quot;. At the same time, the popes began referring to the cardinal priests of Rome to serve as legates and delegates within Rome at ceremonies, synods, councils, etc., as well as abroad on diplomatic missions and councils. Those who were assigned to the latter roles were given the titles of Legatus a latere (Cardinal Legate) and Missus Specialis (Special Missions).

During the pontificate of Stephen V (816–17), the three classes of the college that are present today began to form. Stephen decreed that all cardinal-bishops were bound to sing Mass on rotation at the high altar at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, one per Sunday. The first class to form was that of the cardinal-deacons, direct theological descendants of the original seven ordained in Acts 6, followed by the cardinal-priests, and finally, the cardinal-bishops.

The college played an integral part in various reforms within the Church as well, as early as the pontificate of Pope Leo IX (1050). In the 12th century, the Third Lateran Council declared that only Cardinals could assume the papacy, a requirement that has since lapsed. In 1130, under Innocent II, all the classes were permitted to take part in papal elections; up to this point, only cardinal-bishops had this role.

From the 13th to 15th centuries, the size of the College of Cardinals never exceeded thirty, although there were more than thirty parishes and diaconal districts which could potentially have a titular holder; Pope John XXII (1316–1334) formalized this norm by limiting the college to twenty members. In the ensuing century, increasing the size of the college became a method for the pope to raise funds for construction or war, cultivate European alliances, and dilute the strength of the college as a spiritual and political counterweight to papal supremacy.

===Size of the College ===
The conclave capitulation of the 1352 papal conclave limited the size of the college to twenty, and decreed that no new cardinals could be created until the size of the college had dropped to 16; however, Pope Innocent VI declared the capitulation invalid the following year.

By the end of the 14th century, the practice of having solely Italian cardinals had ceased. Between the 14th and 17th centuries, there was much struggle for the college between the cardinals and the reigning popes. Although some popes increased the number of cardinals in order to guarantee allies, Pope Benedict XII often refused to do so and created six new cardinals on only one occasion, in 1338.

The Council of Basel (1431–1437, later transferred to Ferrara and then Florence) limited the size of the college to 24, as did the capitulation of the 1464 papal conclave. The capitulations of the 1484 (Pope Innocent VIII) and 1513 (Pope Leo X) conclaves contained the same restriction. The capitulation of the 1492 papal conclave also contained a restriction on the creation of new cardinals.

The Fifth Council of the Lateran (1512–1517), despite its detailed regulation of the lives of cardinals, did not consider the size of the college.

In 1517 Pope Leo X added another thirty-one cardinals, bringing the total to sixty-five so that he could have a supportive majority in the College of Cardinals. Paul IV brought the total to seventy. His immediate successor, Pope Pius IV (1559–1565), raised the limit to seventy-six. Although Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor sought a limit of 26 and complained about the size and quality of the college to his legates to the Council of Trent, and some French attendees advocated a limit of 24, that council did not prescribe a limit to the size of the college. By the papacy of Sixtus V (1585–1590), the number was set at seventy on 3 December 1586, divided among fourteen cardinal-deacons, fifty cardinal-priests, and six cardinal-bishops.

Popes respected that limit until Pope John XXIII increased the number of cardinals several times to 88 in January 1961 and Pope Paul VI continued this expansion, reaching 134 at his third consistory in April 1969.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, there has also been an internationalization of the College of Cardinals.

===Maximum number of electors ===
The total size of the college lost its significance when Paul VI decided to allow only cardinals under the age of 80 to vote in a conclave from 1971 onward. Then, in 1975, Paul set the maximum number of those under 80, the cardinal electors, at 120. His next consistory in 1976 brought the number of cardinal electors to its full complement of 120.

All of Paul&#x27;s successors have at times exceeded the 120 maximum (except for Pope John Paul I, who did not hold any consistories during his very short pontificate). Pope John Paul II reiterated the 120 maximum in 1996, yet his appointments to the college resulted in more than 120 cardinal electors in four of his nine consistories, reaching a high of 135 in February 2001 and again in October 2003. Three of Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s five consistories resulted in more than 120 cardinal electors, the high being 125 in 2012. Pope Francis has exceeded the limit in all ten of his consistories, reaching as high as 140 in December 2024.

===Orders===
Other changes to the college in the 20th century affected specific orders. The 1917 Code of Canon Law decreed that from then on only those who were priests or bishops could be chosen as cardinals, thus officially closing the historical period in which some cardinals could be clergy who had only received first tonsure and minor order, or the major orders of deacon and subdeacon without a further ordination to the priesthood. In 1961 Pope John XXIII reserved to the pope the right to assign any member of the college to one of the suburbicarian sees and the rank of cardinal bishop. Previously only the senior cardinal priest and the senior cardinal deacon had the privilege of requesting such an appointment (&quot;jus optionis&quot;) when a vacancy occurred. In 1962 he established that all cardinals should be bishops, ending the identification of the order of cardinal deacon with cardinals who were not bishops. He consecrated the twelve non-bishop members of the college himself. In February 1965, Pope Paul VI decided that an Eastern Rite Patriarch who is created a cardinal would no longer be assigned a titular church in Rome, but maintain his see and join the order of cardinal bishops, the rank previously reserved to the six cardinals assigned to the suburbicarian dioceses. He also required that the suburbicarian bishops elect one of themselves as the Dean and Vice-Dean of the college, instead of allowing them to select any member of the college. In June 2018, Pope Francis eased the rules governing the rank of cardinal bishop to open that rank to anyone of the pope&#x27;s choosing, granting such cardinals the same privileges as those assigned suburbicarian sees.

===Other modifications ===
Pope Francis adjusted the rules regarding the Dean in December 2019, so they now serve for a term of five years which can be renewed by the Pope. No change was made regarding the Vice-Dean.

The resignation or removal of members has been a relatively rare phenomenon. Between 1791 and 2018, only one was removed from the college – Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne in 1791 – and five resigned: Tommaso Antici in 1798, Marino Carafa di Belevedere in 1807, Carlo Odescalchi in 1838, Louis Billot in 1927, and Theodore Edgar McCarrick in 2018.

===Historical data===
For the Middle Ages, sources concerning the size of the College of Cardinals are most frequently those relating to papal elections and conclaves.


==Functions==
A function of the college is to advise the pope about church matters when he summons them to an ordinary consistory, a term derived from the Roman Emperor&#x27;s crown council. It also attends various functions as a matter of protocol, for example, during the canonization process.

It also convenes on the death or resignation of a pope as a papal conclave to elect a successor, but is then restricted to eligible Cardinals under the age limit, which was set for the first time in 1970 by Pope Paul VI at 80.

The college has no ruling power except during the &quot;sede vacante&quot; (papal vacancy) period, and even then its powers are extremely limited by the terms of the current law, which is laid down in the Apostolic constitution &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; (1996) and the Fundamental Law of Vatican City State.

Historically, cardinals were the clergy serving parishes of the city of Rome under its bishop, the pope. The college acquired particular importance following the crowning of Henry IV as King of Germany and Holy Roman Emperor at the age of six, after the unexpected death of Henry III in 1056. Until then, the Holy See was often bitterly fought for among Rome&#x27;s aristocratic families and external secular authorities had significant influence over who was to be appointed pope, and the Holy Roman Emperor in particular had the special power to appoint him. This was significant as the aims and views of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Church did not always coincide. Churchmen involved in what has become known as the Gregorian Reform took advantage of the new king&#x27;s lack of power and in 1059 reserved the election of the pope to the clergy of the Church in Rome. This was part of a larger power struggle, which became known as the Investiture Controversy, as the Church and the Emperor each attempted to gain more control over the appointment of bishops, and in doing so wield more influence in the lands and governments they were appointed to. Reserving to the cardinals the election of the pope represented a significant shift in the balance of power in the Early Medieval world. From the beginning of the 12th century, the College of Cardinals started to meet as such, when the cardinal bishops, cardinal priests and cardinal deacons ceased acting as separate groups.

===Officials===
In the Catholic church, the Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Cardinal Vice-Dean are the president and vice-president of the college. Both are elected by and from the cardinal bishops (cardinals of the highest order, including those holding suburbicarian dioceses), but the election requires papal confirmation. Except for presiding and delegating administrative tasks, they have no authority over the cardinals, acting as (first among equals).

The Secretary of Roman Curia, the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, the Vicar General of Rome, and the Patriarchs of Venice and Lisbon, are usually cardinals, with few, usually temporary, exceptions. The Fundamental Law of Vatican City State requires that appointees to the state&#x27;s legislative body, the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, be cardinals.

===Electing the pope===
Under the terms of Pope Paul VI&#x27;s 1970 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ingravescentem aetatem&quot;, cardinals who reached the age of 80 before a conclave opened had no vote in papal elections. Pope John Paul II&#x27;s &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; of 22 February 1996 modified that rule slightly, so that cardinals who have reached the age of 80 before the day the see becomes vacant are not eligible to vote.

Canon law sets the general qualifications for a man to be appointed bishop quite broadly, requiring someone of faith and good reputation, at least thirty-five years old and with a certain level of education and five years&#x27; experience as a priest. The cardinals have nevertheless consistently elected the Bishop of Rome from among their own membership since the death of Pope Urban VI (the last non-cardinal to become pope) in 1389. The conclave rules specify the procedures to be followed should they elect someone residing outside Vatican City or not yet a bishop.

Of the 117 cardinals under the age of 80 at the time of Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s resignation, 115 participated in the conclave of March 2013 that elected Pope Francis to succeed him. The two who did not participate were Julius Riyadi Darmaatmadja (for health reasons) and Keith O&#x27;Brien (following allegations of sexual misconduct).

<doc id="308792" wikidata="Q234782" url="?curid=308792" title="Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem">
<text>Sibylla (; – 25 July 1190) was the queen of Jerusalem from 1186 to 1190. She reigned alongside her husband Guy of Lusignan, to whom she was unwaveringly attached despite his unpopularity among the barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Sibylla was the eldest daughter of King Amalric and the only daughter of Agnes of Courtenay. Her father died in 1174, making her heir presumptive to her younger brother, King Baldwin IV. When it became clear that 13-year-old Baldwin had contracted leprosy, the matter of Sibylla&#x27;s marriage became urgent. The regent, Count Raymond III of Tripoli, arranged for her to marry William Longsword of Montferrat in late 1176, but within a year William died, leaving her pregnant and in possession of the County of Jaffa and Ascalon.

Shortly after giving birth to a son, Baldwin, Sibylla came to be associated with her brother in public acts, thereby being designated as next in line to the throne. Sibylla&#x27;s second marriage, to Guy of Lusignan, was arranged in 1180 by her brother. Likely done to foil a coup planned by Raymond, the marriage deeply divided the nobility. By 1183, King Baldwin had become completely disabled as well as disillusioned with Guy&#x27;s character and ability to lead. In order to prevent Guy&#x27;s accession to the throne, he had Sibylla&#x27;s son crowned as co-king and attempted to separate Sibylla from Guy, but she refused.

Sibylla&#x27;s brother, Baldwin IV, died in 1185, having named Raymond to rule as regent for Baldwin V instead of Sibylla or Guy. The boy king died the next year, and Sibylla moved quickly to claim the throne against Raymond&#x27;s ambitions. She agreed to her supporters&#x27; demand to set Guy aside on the condition that she could choose her next husband. At her coronation in mid-September 1186, she outwitted her supporters by choosing Guy and crowning him herself. Saladin took advantage of the discord in the kingdom to invade in 1187, reducing the Kingdom of Jerusalem to a single city, Tyre. Sibylla visited her husband, who had been taken captive at the decisive Battle of Hattin, and procured from Saladin his release. She died, along with their daughters, of an epidemic outside Acre while Guy was besieging it.

==Childhood==
Sibylla was the elder of the two children of the count of Jaffa and Ascalon, Amalric, and his first wife, Agnes of Courtenay. She was born between 1157, when her parents married, and 1161, when her brother, Baldwin, was born. On her father&#x27;s side, Sibylla was the niece of the then-reigning king of Jerusalem, Baldwin III, and granddaughter of Queen Melisende, the first female ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The ruling class of the kingdom and other crusader states, called the Franks, were French-speaking Catholics who had arrived in the Levant from Western Europe and remained Western in culture. Sibylla was named after the countess of Flanders, her father&#x27;s half-sister.

When King Baldwin III died in 1163, the High Court forced Amalric to agree to an annulment of his marriage to Agnes in order to be accepted as the new king. He succeeded in having his and Agnes&#x27;s children declared legitimate by Pope Alexander III. In common with Western practices, Sibylla was educated by the king&#x27;s aunt Abbess Ioveta, Queen Melisende&#x27;s youngest sister, at the Convent of Saint Lazarus near Jerusalem. She consequently had little contact with her mother or brother, who was heir apparent to their father. With his second wife, Maria Komnene, the king had two daughters, of whom Isabella survived infancy.

King Amalric feared that, like his brother and their father, King Fulk, he too would die young, before his heir reached the age of majority. Having no close male relative who could rule as regent on his son&#x27;s behalf if the latter ascended as a minor, Amalric authorized the archbishop of Tyre, Frederick de la Roche, in 1169 to find a husband for Sibylla in Western Europe. The candidate had to be an older man of high-enough rank and with enough experience in government. Amalric chose Count Stephen I of Sancerre, the brother-in-law of King Louis VII of France and a relative of the English royal house. Stephen thus came to Jerusalem in 1171. Sibylla&#x27;s brother was suspected of having contracted leprosy, then an incurable disease that would prevent him from marrying and having children, and Amalric may have seen Sibylla and Stephen as eventual monarchs. Stephen rejected the match, however, for unknown reasons.

==Heir presumptive==

When King Amalric died of dysentery in July 1174, the High Court met to discuss who should succeed him. Sibylla&#x27;s 13-year-old brother, Baldwin, would have been the obvious successor had there not been for fears of his incipient leprosy. The only serious alternative to him was Sibylla, then aged about 15. Female succession had been grounded in recent law and had precedent, as Amalric&#x27;s mother, Melisende, preceded her sons on the throne. But unlike her grandmother, Sibylla was young, inexperienced, and unmarried. No bachelor in the Latin East was fit to marry her; Count Raymond III of Tripoli and Baldwin of Antioch were too closely related, and a marriage to one of the barons in the kingdom could have caused resentment among the others. A match had to be found abroad, but that would have taken too long. Baldwin IV was therefore chosen, with the expectation that a husband would be found for Sibylla to succeed him if he proved to be affected during his minority.

===Marriage===
Count Raymond of Tripoli, who was by then also prince of Galilee in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, became regent for the young king on the basis of being the nearest male relative. He allowed Sibylla and Baldwin&#x27;s mother, Agnes, to return to court. The siblings came to be strongly influenced by their mother in the following years. Baldwin&#x27;s condition deteriorated rapidly after his accession, and there was no longer any doubt that he was affected by leprosy. It became imperative to arrange a marriage for Sibylla. The groom chosen by Raymond and the High Court was William Longsword, son of Marquis William V of Montferrat and cousin of both Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and King Louis VII of France.

William arrived in the East in October 1176. By that time, the barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem were no longer so well disposed towards him, likely because Emperor Frederick had suffered military setbacks against the Lombard League and could no longer be expected to aid Catholics in the East. The marriage had to go forward, however, because if she were to be jilted again, Sibylla&#x27;s marriage prospects could irreparably diminish. The couple married in November, and he was granted the County of Jaffa and Ascalon. Sibylla was the only countess in the kingdom besides her mother, who had been granted the title after the annulment of the royal marriage, which conferred a certain distinction. Baldwin may have offered to abdicate in William&#x27;s favour, but William would have declined because he knew he lacked support among the nobility.

===Countess===

Around April 1177, shortly after he and Sibylla conceived a child, William fell critically ill. He died in June, by which time her pregnancy was known. Sibylla was left as the &quot;suo jure&quot; countess of Jaffa and Ascalon. Sibylla and Baldwin&#x27;s first cousin Count Philip I of Flanders arrived in Jerusalem soon after but declined regency when Baldwin offered it to him. Philip&#x27;s only goal was to arrange for Sibylla and her half-sister Isabella to marry Robert and William, respectively, sons of his favourite liegeman Robert V of Béthune. The High Court countered that custom entitled the widowed Sibylla to a year of mourning, which was especially seemly given her pregnancy. Philip and the High Court could not agree on which of them had the final say in choosing Sibylla&#x27;s next husband. The opposition to Philip was led by the lord of Ramla, Baldwin of Ibelin, who hoped to be the chosen suitor.

Sibylla gave birth to a son, named Baldwin in honour of her brother, in the winter of 1177–78. Her mourning period ended in June 1178, and it became appropriate to negotiate a new marriage. Baldwin of Ibelin&#x27;s suit was rejected, but his brother Balian was allowed to marry Queen Maria, stepmother of Sibylla and the king. On 1 July 1178, Sibylla began to be associated with her brother in public acts, reminiscent of their grandmother Melisende&#x27;s association with her father, King Baldwin II. Baldwin IV thus confirmed Sibylla&#x27;s status as his heir presumptive.

The High Court agreed unanimously that Sibylla should next marry Duke Hugh III of Burgundy. The king so desperately needed a brother-in-law that he empowered the king of France to choose an alternative candidate if Hugh refused. Hugh intended to sail to the East in early 1180 and marry Sibylla at Easter. A group of crusaders from France, led by Count Henry I of Champagne, Peter I of Courtenay, and Philip of Dreux, arrived in July 1179. They failed to prevent the Egyptian ruler Saladin from destroying the crusader fortress of Le Chastellet but remained in the kingdom in the hopes of assisting at Sibylla and Hugh&#x27;s coronation the following year.

===Remarriage===

Things took an unexpected turn during the Holy Week in 1180. The brewing conflict in France that followed the accession of King Philip II prevented Hugh from leaving his domain. Contemporary chroniclers Ernoul and William of Tyre relate the events differently. According to Ernoul, Sibylla wrote to Baldwin of Ibelin when he was in Saladin&#x27;s captivity, promising that she would convince her brother to allow their marriage if he could ransom himself, but was persuaded by her mother to marry Guy of Lusignan, a Poitevin knight, instead. Historian Bernard Hamilton argues that Ernoul&#x27;s account, though accepted in older historiography, is biased in favour of the Ibelins.

William of Tyre reports that during the Holy Week in 1180, Count Raymond III of Tripoli and Prince Bohemond III of Antioch were marching towards Jerusalem to stage a coup against King Baldwin. Hamilton concludes that their intention was to force the king to have Sibylla marry Baldwin of Ibelin and to then abdicate, and that the king foiled their plan by arranging her marriage to Guy. Baldwin of Ibelin had never been approved by Sibylla&#x27;s brother, possibly because his family had only recently risen to lordly rank. Another factor was that Saladin had been informed by Raymond and Bohemond&#x27;s conspiracy to enthrone Baldwin and therefore set Baldwin&#x27;s ransom to that of a king; a successor with such a debt was not desirable.

From 1180, Sibylla held Jaffa and Ascalon with Guy, and had four daughters with him, including Alice and Maria. Their marriage divided the nobility into a faction supporting Guy (Sibylla; the king; their mother, Agnes; their stepfather, Raynald, lord of Sidon; their maternal uncle, Joscelin of Courtenay; and the lord of Oultrejordain, Raynald of Châtillon) and a faction opposing him (Sibylla&#x27;s paternal kinsmen Bohemond of Antioch and Raymond of Tripoli; Baldwin and Balian of Ibelin; and her stepmother, Maria Komnene). In order to prevent the opposing party from setting up a rival claimant, the king took his mother&#x27;s advice and, in October 1180, betrothed his half-sister Isabella, Maria&#x27;s daughter and Balian&#x27;s stepdaughter, to Humphrey IV of Toron, stepson of Raynald of Châtillon. From March 1181, both Sibylla and Guy were associated with King Baldwin in public acts.
 
 

 
 

==Disinheritance==
Baldwin IV&#x27;s leprosy progressed quickly; in 1183 he lost his sight and could no longer walk unsupported or use his hands. Having developed a life-threatening fever, the king summoned the High Court in June and made Guy regent. Baldwin retained only the royal title and the city of Jerusalem. Guy proved far too unpopular to be an effective military leader, and gravely insulted the incapacitated king by refusing to exchange Jerusalem for Tyre.

Saladin attacked Kerak Castle in late 1183 while the wedding of Sibylla&#x27;s half-sister Isabella to Humphrey of Toron was celebrated. Baldwin summoned his troops. Not trusting him to efficiently command the army, the king deprived Guy of regency and, effectively, of his place in the line of succession. The succession was then deliberated by the assembled nobility, which included Guy, Agnes, Bohemond of Antioch, Raymond of Tripoli, Raynald of Sidon, and the Ibelin brothers, but not Sibylla&#x27;s supporters Raynald of Châtillon and Joscelin of Courtenay. Eventually, Agnes&#x27;s proposal that Sibylla&#x27;s five-year-old son, Baldwin V, be crowned co-king was accepted because his was the next strongest claim after Sibylla&#x27;s. The coronation took place on 20 November, and the boy received the homage of all the barons except his stepfather. Baldwin IV and his army then relieved the siege of Kerak.

The question of who would rule the kingdom as regent for Baldwin V troubled the disabled king. Sibylla and Guy would have the best claim to regency if Baldwin IV died. Her brother knew that this could only be prevented by having their marriage annulled and discussed the matter with the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Heraclius. Baldwin failed to take into account Sibylla&#x27;s steadfast devotion to Guy as well as Guy&#x27;s friendship with Heraclius, who may have warned the count about Baldwin&#x27;s intentions. Instead of going to Jerusalem with the rest of the army after lifting the siege of Kerak, Guy went straight to Ascalon and sent a message to Sibylla, who joined him there. The annulment could not proceed without their presence, and the couple&#x27;s refusal to leave Ascalon despite the king&#x27;s summons frustrated the scheme to separate them. Baldwin next attempted to confiscate Jaffa and Ascalon but only succeeded in revoking Jaffa.

On Baldwin IV&#x27;s deathbed in early 1185, the right to rule the kingdom as regent in the name of Baldwin V, then a sickly child, was offered to the count of Tripoli. Raymond accepted the regency on the condition that the pope should, on the advice of the Holy Roman emperor and the kings of England and France, decide whether the crown should pass to Sibylla or Isabella in case of Baldwin V&#x27;s premature death. The High Court accepted the conditions and swore an oath to him in the presence of Baldwin IV. Guardianship of the boy was awarded to his granduncle Joscelin of Courtenay. Raymond&#x27;s party were determined to prevent Sibylla&#x27;s accession; they questioned her legitimacy on the basis of the annulment of her parents&#x27; marriage and emphasized that her half-sister, Isabella, was born to a reigning king. The latter argument, resting on the Byzantine idea of being &quot;born in the purple&quot;, may have come from Isabella&#x27;s Byzantine mother, Maria Komnene. Baldwin IV died in March 1185 or before 16 May 1185 at the latest, when Sibylla&#x27;s son, Baldwin V, is recorded as the sole king. Baldwin V&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Marquis William V of Montferrat, arrived in Jerusalem to safeguard the young king&#x27;s rights.

==Reign==
===Accession===

Sibylla&#x27;s son died in Acre in August 1186. Sibylla&#x27;s mother had died by then too. Raymond summoned the High Court to Nablus. It was attended by Sibylla&#x27;s half-sister, Isabella; Isabella&#x27;s husband, Humphrey, and her stepfamily, the Ibelins; and likely by Raymond&#x27;s stepsons, Hugh, William, Ralph, and Odo of Saint Omer. Contemporaries believed that Raymond intended to claim the throne for himself. Meanwhile, Sibylla&#x27;s uncle Joscelin of Courtenay took possession of Acre and Beirut in her name. Sybilla hurried to Jerusalem to attend her son&#x27;s funeral. She and Guy garrisoned the city with their strong armed escort.

The count of Tripoli underestimated the support for Sibylla. The lord of Oultrejordain and her first husband&#x27;s father, the marquess of Montferrat, came to Sybilla&#x27;s side. She was also backed by the patriarch and the Master of the Knights Templar, Gerard of Ridefort, who both resided in Jerusalem, as well as by the constable, Guy&#x27;s brother Aimery; the chancellor, Peter of Lydda; and the seneschal, her uncle Joscelin. The nobility and clergy assembled in Jerusalem wished to settle the succession immediately. They concurred that Sibylla had the best claim, but disagreed on whether Guy should become king alongside her. In the end, Sibylla&#x27;s supporters required her to leave Guy in return for their recognition of her rights. Sibylla acquiesced on three conditions: the legitimisation of her daughters by Guy, Guy&#x27;s retention of Jaffa and Ascalon, and the freedom to choose a new husband as she saw fit. The conditions were accepted.

===Coronation===

On the advice of Heraclius and Gerard, Sibylla sent an invitation to the nobles at Nablus to attend her coronation. Possibly in an attempt to appease Raymond and his party, Guy was not mentioned in it; Sibylla proclaimed that the kingdom had passed to her by right of inheritance. They nevertheless refused to attend, arguing that doing so would violate the oaths taken at Baldwin IV&#x27;s deathbed, and went so far as to send a delegation of monks to forbid the coronation. The master of the Knights Hospitaller, Roger des Moulins, also declined to be present, more likely due to the oath than out of any opposition to Sibylla. He was nevertheless persuaded to surrender his key to the chest containing regalia. The city gates were barred ahead of the coronation to prevent disruption by the opposing party, and instead of by the attendees, Sibylla was acclaimed queen by the citizens of Jerusalem at the urging of Raynald of Châtillon.

As was traditional, the coronation was held at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, likely in mid-September. After crowning her, the patriarch gave a second crown to Sibylla and asked her to choose a new consort. She astonished the attendees by calling forth Guy and placing the crown on his head. Having agreed that she should choose a husband after setting Guy aside, the assembled noblemen could raise no objection to her choice. Upon hearing about this turn of events, Raymond proposed crowning Isabella and Humphrey as rival monarchs, but Humphrey sneaked out of Nablus at night and rode to Jerusalem. Upon arrival, he demanded an audience with the queen, who agreed after initial reluctance. He swore fealty to her, and she took him to see Guy, to whom he paid homage. Roger des Moulins and Heraclius mediated peace, and all the barons except Raymond of Tripoli and Baldwin of Ibelin came to Jerusalem to submit.

===Fall of Jerusalem===
Sibylla was well-positioned to wield power because Guy&#x27;s authority was entirely dependent on her. She was associated with her husband in public acts in the first months of their reign, but this was cut short by Saladin&#x27;s invasion. In an act of continued defiance, Raymond had retired to his fief of Galilee, allied with Saladin, and garrisoned Tiberias with Muslim troops. The sultan attacked the kingdom on 26 April 1187. After Muslim troops annihilated the combined armies of the Templars and the Hospitallers at Cresson near Nazareth on 1 May, Raymond was forced by his own vassals to submit to Guy. Though now unified, the kingdom had been critically weakened by the defeat at Cresson. The Christian army led by Guy suffered a crushing defeat at the Horns of Hattin on 4 July. The king was taken prisoner; Raynald was executed; and Raymond died of an illness in Tripoli in September.

At the time of King Guy&#x27;s defeat and imprisonment at Hattin, Queen Sibylla was in Jerusalem. The queen went to Ascalon with her daughters to defend the city and only surrendered it to Saladin in return for Guy&#x27;s release, but the sultan nevertheless kept him imprisoned. In September, Saladin besieged Jerusalem. The queen commanded the defence with the assistance of Patriarch Heraclius and Balian of Ibelin, but intense bombardment forced them to surrender. Saladin allowed the defeated to ransom themselves, and Sibylla was further permitted to visit Guy in Nablus while she travelled to Antioch. She was apparently prevented from embarking there for Europe when her ship was seized by Conrad of Montferrat, her first husband&#x27;s brother who had taken up the defence of Tyre. Sibylla instead joined her stepmother, Queen Maria, in Tripoli. In the months following the Battle of Hattin, all of the kingdom except Tyre fell to Saladin.

Sibylla repeatedly pleaded with Saladin for Guy&#x27;s release, and the sultan granted her request in July 1188. The couple reunited on the island of Arwad near Tortosa, from where they went north to Antioch and then back south to Tripoli, gathering an army along the way. They marched to Tyre in April 1189. The city&#x27;s defender, Conrad, refused to allow the king and queen into the city, forcing them to spend months outside its walls. Conrad posited that Guy had forfeited the kingdom at Hattin and that Tyre was being held in trust for the Holy Roman emperor and the kings of England and France, who would decide to whom the government should be assigned.

==Death==
The Third Crusade was launched in 1189, and Sibylla accompanied Guy to the siege of Acre along with Humphrey, Isabella, Maria, and Balian. An epidemic struck the crusaders&#x27; camp in 1190. Sibylla died on 25 July, a few days after her daughters Alice and Maria. It is not clear whether the other two daughters had died earlier or at the same time. The &quot;Itinerarium&quot; recorded accusations of foul play against Guy, but in truth, their deaths deprived Guy of any right to the throne. Sibylla&#x27;s heir was her half-sister Isabella I.

==Assessment==
Historian Bernard Hamilton disagrees with Ernoul&#x27;s characterization of Sibylla as fickle, foolish, and sentimental, arguing that the portrayal &quot;bears little relation to the known facts&quot;. Influenced by the prevailing medieval perception of ideal queenship, Sibylla&#x27;s contemporaries and near-contemporaneous chroniclers were interested more in her relationship with Guy than in her military activity. Standing by her husband won her approval of her contemporaries; Roger of Wendover described her as:

Resourcefulness and loyalty remain Sibylla&#x27;s chief traits in modern historiography, which historian Helen J. Nicholson attributes to the distortion of her image by contemporary gender ideals.

<doc id="308793" wikidata="Q529622" url="?curid=308793" title="Aneuploidy">
<text>Aneuploidy is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, for example a human somatic cell having 45 or 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. It does not include a difference of one or more complete sets of chromosomes. A cell with any number of complete chromosome sets is called a &quot;euploid&quot; cell.

An extra or missing chromosome is a common cause of some genetic disorders. Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes. About 68% of human solid tumors are aneuploid. Aneuploidy originates during cell division when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells (nondisjunction). Most cases of aneuploidy in the autosomes result in miscarriage, and the most common extra autosomal chromosomes among live births are 21, 18 and 13. Chromosome abnormalities are detected in 1 of 160 live human births. Autosomal aneuploidy is more dangerous than sex chromosome aneuploidy, as autosomal aneuploidy is almost always lethal to embryos that cease developing because of it.

As women age, oocytes develop defects in mitochondrial structure and function and have meiotic spindle dysregulation: these increase rates of aneuploidy and miscarriage. The rate of aneuploidy in women using IVF increases from 30% at age 31 to 36% at age 36. After this it increases by 7% per year to reach 89% at age 44.

==Chromosomes==

Most cells in the human body have 23 pairs of chromosomes, or a total of 46 chromosomes. (The sperm and egg, or gametes, each have 23 unpaired chromosomes, and red blood cells in bone marrow have a nucleus at first but those red blood cells that are active in blood lose their nucleus and thus they end up having no nucleus and therefore no chromosomes.)

One copy of each pair is inherited from the mother and the other copy is inherited from the father. The first 22 pairs of chromosomes (called autosomes) are numbered from 1 to 22, from largest to smallest. The 23rd pair of chromosomes are the sex chromosomes. Typical females have two X chromosomes, while typical males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. The characteristics of the chromosomes in a cell as they are seen under a light microscope are called the karyotype.

During meiosis, when germ cells divide to create sperm and egg (gametes), each half should have the same number of chromosomes. But sometimes, the whole pair of chromosomes will end up in one gamete, and the other gamete will not get that chromosome at all.

Most embryos cannot survive with a missing or extra autosome (numbered chromosome) and are miscarried. The most frequent aneuploidy in humans is trisomy 16 and fetuses affected with the full version of this chromosome abnormality do not survive to term, although it is possible for surviving individuals to have the mosaic form, where trisomy 16 exists in some cells but not all. The most common aneuploidy that infants can survive with is trisomy 21, which is found in Down syndrome, affecting 1 in 800 births. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) affects 1 in 6,000 births, and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) affects 1 in 10,000 births. 10% of infants with trisomy 18 or 13 reach 1 year of age.

Changes in chromosome number may not necessarily be present in all cells in an individual. When aneuploidy is detected in a fraction of cells in an individual, it is called chromosomal mosaicism. In general, individuals who are mosaic for a chromosomal aneuploidy tend to have a less severe form of the syndrome compared to those with full trisomy. For many of the autosomal trisomies, only mosaic cases survive to term. However, mitotic aneuploidy may be more common than previously recognized in somatic tissues, and aneuploidy is a characteristic of many types of tumorigenesis.

==Mechanisms==
Aneuploidy arises from errors in chromosome segregation, which can go wrong in several ways.

&quot;Nondisjunction&quot; usually occurs as the result of a weakened mitotic checkpoint, as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. For example, if a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to &#x27;notice&#x27; that a chromosome pair is not lined with the spindle apparatus. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one chromatid ending up in each cell), while others could fail to separate at all. This would generate a daughter cell lacking a copy and a daughter cell with an extra copy.

&quot;Completely inactive mitotic checkpoints&quot; may cause nondisjunction at multiple chromosomes, possibly all. Such a scenario could result in each daughter cell possessing a disjoint set of genetic material.

&quot;Merotelic attachment&quot; occurs when one kinetochore is attached to both mitotic spindle poles. One daughter cell would have a normal complement of chromosomes; the second would lack one. A third daughter cell may end up with the &#x27;missing&#x27; chromosome.

Multipolar spindles: more than two spindle poles form. Such a mitotic division would result in one daughter cell for each spindle pole; each cell may possess an unpredictable complement of chromosomes.

&quot;Monopolar spindle&quot;: only a single spindle pole forms. This produces a single daughter cell with its copy number doubled.

A &quot;tetraploid intermediate&quot; may be produced as the end-result of the monopolar spindle mechanism. In such a case, the cell has double the copy number of a normal cell, and produces double the number of spindle poles as well. This results in four daughter cells with an unpredictable complement of chromosomes, but in the normal copy number.

==Somatic mosaicism in the nervous system==
Mosaicism for aneuploid chromosome content may be part of the constitutional make-up of the mammalian brain. In the normal human brain, brain samples from six individuals ranging from 2–86 years of age had mosaicism for chromosome 21 aneuploidy (average of 4% of neurons analyzed). This low-level aneuploidy appears to arise from chromosomal segregation defects during cell division in neuronal precursor cells, and neurons containing such aneuploid chromosome content reportedly integrate into normal circuits. However, recent research using single-cell sequencing has challenged these findings, and has suggested that aneuploidy in the brain is actually very rare.

==Somatic mosaicism in cancer==
Aneuploidy is consistently observed in virtually all cancers. The German biologist Theodor Boveri was first to propose a causative role for aneuploidy in cancer. However, the theory of Boveri was forgotten until the molecular biologist Peter Duesberg reappraised it. Understanding through what mechanisms it can affect tumor evolution is an important topic of current cancer research.

Somatic mosaicism occurs in virtually all cancer cells, including trisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and trisomy 8 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these forms of mosaic aneuploidy occur through mechanisms distinct from those typically associated with genetic syndromes involving complete or mosaic aneuploidy, such as chromosomal instability (due to mitotic segregation defects in cancer cells). Therefore, the molecular processes that lead to aneuploidy are targets for the development of cancer drugs. Both resveratrol and aspirin have been found &quot;in vivo&quot; (in mice) to selectively destroy tetraploid cells that may be precursors of aneuploid cells, and activate AMPK, which may be involved in the process.

Alteration of normal mitotic checkpoints are also important tumorigenic events, and these may directly lead to aneuploidy.
Loss of tumor suppressor p53 gene often results in genomic instability, which could lead to the aneuploidy genotype.

In addition, genetic syndromes in which an individual is predisposed to breakage of chromosomes (chromosome instability syndromes) are frequently associated with increased risk for various types of cancer, thus highlighting the role of somatic aneuploidy in carcinogenesis.

The ability to evade the immune system appears to be enhanced in tumoral cells with strong aneuploidy. This has therefore suggested that the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes might be an effective predictive biomarker for response to precise immunotherapy. For example, in melanoma patients, high somatic copy number alterations are associated with less effective response to immune checkpoint blockade anti–CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4) therapy.

A research work published in 2008 focuses on the mechanisms involved in aneuploidy formation, specifically on the epigenetic origin of aneuploid cells. Epigenetic inheritance is defined as cellular information other than the DNA sequence itself, that is still heritable during cell division. DNA methylation and histone modifications comprise two of the main epigenetic modifications important for many physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation is the most common molecular lesion in cancer-cells, even more frequent than gene mutations. Tumor suppressor gene silencing by CpG island promoter hypermethylation is supposed to be the most frequent epigenetic modification in cancer cells. Epigenetic characteristics of cells may be modified by several factors including environmental exposure, deficiencies of certain nutrients, radiation, etc. Some of the alterations have been correlated with the formation of aneuploid cells in vivo. In this study it is suggested on a growing basis of evidence, that not only genetics but also epigenetics, contribute to aneuploid cell formation.

==Partial aneuploidy==
The terms &quot;partial monosomy&quot; and &quot;partial trisomy&quot; are used to describe an imbalance of genetic material caused by loss or gain of part of a chromosome. In particular, these terms would be used in the situation of an unbalanced translocation, where an individual carries a derivative chromosome formed through the breakage and fusion of two different chromosomes. In this situation, the individual would have three copies of part of one chromosome (two normal copies and the portion that exists on the derivative chromosome) and only one copy of part of the other chromosome involved in the derivative chromosome. Robertsonian translocations, for example, account for a very small minority of Down syndrome cases (&lt;5%). The formation of one isochromosome results in partial trisomy of the genes present in the isochromosome and partial monosomy of the genes in the lost arm.

==Aneugens==
Agents capable of causing aneuploidy are called aneugens. Many mutagenic carcinogens are aneugens. X-rays, for example, may cause aneuploidy by fragmenting the chromosome; it may also target the spindle apparatus. Other chemicals such as colchicine can also produce aneuploidy by affecting microtubule polymerization.

Exposure of males to lifestyle, environmental and/or occupational hazards may increase the risk of spermatozoa aneuploidy. Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that cause DNA damage. Smoking can also induce aneuploidy. For instance, smoking increases chromosome 13 disomy in spermatozoa by 3-fold, and YY disomy by 2-fold.

Occupational exposure to benzene is associated with a 2.8-fold increase of XX disomy and a 2.6-fold increase of YY disomy in spermatozoa.

Pesticides are released to the environment in sufficiently large quantities that most individuals have some degree of exposure. The insecticides fenvalerate and carbaryl have been reported to increase spermatozoa aneuploidy. Occupational exposure of pesticide factory workers to fenvalerate is associated with increased spermatozoa DNA damage. Exposure to fenvalerate raised sex chromosome disomy 1.9-fold and disomy of chromosome 18 by 2.6-fold. Exposure of male workers to carbaryl increased DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa, and also increased sex chromosome disomy by 1.7-fold and chromosome 18 disomy by 2.2-fold.

Humans are exposed to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in many commercial products. Men contaminated with PFCs in whole blood or seminal plasma have spermatozoa with increased levels of DNA fragmentation and chromosomal aneuploidies.

==Diagnosis==
Germline aneuploidy is typically detected through karyotyping, a process in which a sample of cells is fixed and stained to create the typical light and dark chromosomal banding pattern and a picture of the chromosomes is analyzed. Other techniques include fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative PCR of short tandem repeats, quantitative fluorescence PCR (QF-PCR), quantitative PCR dosage analysis, Quantitative Mass Spectrometry of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).

These tests can also be performed prenatally to detect aneuploidy in a pregnancy, through either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Pregnant women of 35 years or older are offered prenatal testing because the chance of chromosomal aneuploidy increases as the mother&#x27;s age increases.

Recent advances have allowed for less invasive testing methods based on the presence of fetal genetic material in maternal blood. See Triple test and Cell-free fetal DNA.

==Terminology==
In the strict sense, a chromosome complement having a number of chromosomes other than 46 (in humans) is considered &quot;heteroploid&quot; while an exact multiple of the haploid chromosome complement is considered euploid.

<text>Ourimbah () is a small township in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, located about north of the state capital Sydney. Ourimbah is located approximately halfway between Sydney and Newcastle. The township today consists of small scattered local shops and businesses along the Pacific Highway, as well as the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle. Ourimbah had a population of 3,951 at the .

== History ==
The Aboriginal word &quot;Oorin&quot; meaning &quot;Belt of manhood&quot; in which a stone axe was carried on hunting expeditions, and &quot;Oorinbah&quot; which is the bora ring or ceremonial ground in which the initiation ceremony of conferring the &quot;belt of manhood&quot; was carried out is where the name for Ourimbah originates from. Ourimbah was also known as &#x27;Blue Gum Flats&#x27; which is what the school was called. The name of Ourimbah was universally adopted for the School, Post Office, Railway and Township in the late 19th century, as well as for Ourimbah Creek that skirts the north of the town.

There are many sites around Ourimbah which provide evidence of Aboriginal occupation. These include axe grinding grooves, archaeological deposits of campfires and food scraps, cave art, as well as many stone implements which have been purloined by museums and privateers.

Blue Gum Flat Public School (Ourimbah Public School) was built in 1863 on the site of the present railway station. In 1886 the school was moved to the opposite side of the road and a wooden building constructed. Ourimbah railway station was built in the same year and opened on 15 August 1887 and was the only station other than Narara between Gosford and Wyong at this time.

The relocation of the school and construction of the railway provided the opportunity for the subdivision of land into &quot;town-size&quot; allotments and the creation at Ourimbah of a townscape at first dubbed &quot;Beckford&quot;. An area had previously been earmarked for a township to the north of this planned subdivision.

The town of Ourimbah, with its blue gums, blackbutts, round leaved gum, spotted gum and white mahogany trees, was an ideal place for the milling of timber to support a Sydney building boom between 1840 and 1870. The 1840s saw a major growth of population in the Ourimbah area. Attracted by the availability of work cutting timber, a great number of young couples moved all through the Central Coast, gradually forming settlements at which many began to put down roots.

While the timber supply thinned out, other means such as Citrus fruit and dairy farming restored the fortunes of Ourimbah. Later, in the 1950s it was realised that the dairy industry could not survive. The citrus farmers found themselves in a similar bind, unable to match the economies of scale available to producers elsewhere.

On the Australia Day long weekend in January 1970, Ourimbah was the venue for Australia&#x27;s first major rock festival, the &quot;Pilgrimage For Pop&quot;, which drew 11,000 fans.

The early 1970s land boom, which saw much land redeveloped into smaller holdings, was the end of any serious potential for farming as a means of supporting a family in Ourimbah. Land use once again changed, with pockets of urban development amongst the acreages, themselves now valuable for the leisure opportunities they offered rather than as agricultural holdings.

In recent years, Ourimbah has grown from a rural town into a suburban commuter township.

== Education ==

Ourimbah Public School is the oldest school on the Central Coast, opening in 1863 as Blue Gum Flat School.
It continues to grow and change from its once small stable rural environment to its present rapidly expanding urban environment.

The University of Newcastle has a campus at Ourimbah through a multi-sector co-located partnership of the University and TAFE NSW – Hunter Institute. The Ourimbah campus offers University, TAFE and Community College programmes and courses on one site so that students can take advantage of pathways between levels and sectors of education and training. Affiliates are the Central Coast Community College and the Central Coast Conservatorium of Music. The University of Newcastle commenced teaching at the Ourimbah Campus, also known as the Central Coast Campus, in 1989.

Campus Central is the Ourimbah Campus student association. Campus Central has been operating as an independent student organisation at the Ourimbah Campus since 1994. Campus Central has retained autonomy through the VSU (Voluntary Student Unionism) legislation changes, and continues to provide services to students, members and the Campus community.

== Symbol of Ourimbah ==
The magpie is commonly used as a symbol for Ourimbah. The black and white bird is featured in the logo of Ourimbah Public School. The school song references the magpie in its first verse, &quot;Here lies Ourimbah nestled in a valley,/ Home of the magpie and blue gum tree&quot; and in its repeating chorus, &quot;home of the magpie colours black and white,&quot; referring to the school uniform colours.

The magpie symbol is used for many local sports teams: Ourimbah Rugby League Football Club, Lisarow Ourimbah Cricket Club, Ourimbah Netball Club, and Ourimbah Lisarow RSL Bowling Club.

<doc id="308803" wikidata="Q2347139" url="?curid=308803" title="Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)">
<text>Carnot&#x27;s theorem, also called Carnot&#x27;s rule or Carnot&#x27;s law, is a principle of thermodynamics developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824 that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency that any heat engine can obtain.

Carnot&#x27;s theorem states that all heat engines operating between the same two thermal or heat reservoirs cannot have efficiencies greater than a reversible heat engine operating between the same reservoirs. A corollary of this theorem is that every reversible heat engine operating between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient, regardless of the working substance employed or the operation details. Since a Carnot heat engine is also a reversible engine, the efficiency of all the reversible heat engines is determined as the efficiency of the Carnot heat engine that depends solely on the temperatures of its hot and cold reservoirs.

The maximum efficiency (i.e., the Carnot heat engine efficiency) of a heat engine operating between hot and cold reservoirs, denoted as and respectively, is the ratio of the temperature difference between the reservoirs to the hot reservoir temperature, expressed in the equation 
:formula_1
where and are the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, respectively, and the efficiency is the ratio of the work done by the engine (to the surroundings) to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir (to the engine).

 is greater than zero if and only if there is a temperature difference between the two thermal reservoirs. Since is the upper limit of all reversible and irreversible heat engine efficiencies, it is concluded that work from a heat engine can be produced if and only if there is a temperature difference between two thermal reservoirs connecting to the engine.

Carnot&#x27;s theorem is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Historically, it was based on contemporary caloric theory, and preceded the establishment of the second law.

==Proof==
The proof of the Carnot theorem is a proof by contradiction or reductio ad absurdum (a method to prove a statement by assuming its falsity and logically deriving a false or contradictory statement from this assumption), based on a situation like the right figure where two heat engines with different efficiencies are operating between two thermal reservoirs at different temperature. The relatively hotter reservoir is called the hot reservoir and the other reservoir is called the cold reservoir. A (not necessarily reversible) heat engine formula_2 with a greater efficiency formula_3 is driving a reversible heat engine formula_4 with a less efficiency formula_5, causing the latter to act as a heat pump. The requirement for the engine formula_4 to be reversible is necessary to explain work formula_7 and heat formula_8 associated with it by using its known efficiency. However, since formula_9, the net heat flow would be backwards, i.e., into the hot reservoir:

:formula_10

where formula_8 represents heat, formula_12 denotes input to an object, formula_13 for output from an object, and formula_14 for the hot thermal reservoir. If heat formula_15 flows from the hot reservoir then it has the sign of + while if formula_16 flows from the hot reservoir then it has the sign of -. This expression can be easily derived by using the definition of the efficiency of a heat engine, formula_17, where work and heat in this expression are net quantities per engine cycle, and the conservation of energy for each engine as shown below. The sign convention of work formula_7, with which the sign of + for work done by an engine to its surroundings, is employed.

The above expression means that heat into the hot reservoir from the engine pair (can be considered as a single engine) is greater than heat into the engine pair from the hot reservoir (i.e., the hot reservoir continuously gets energy). A reversible heat engine with a low efficiency delivers more heat (energy) to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work (energy) to this engine when it is being driven as a heat pump. All these mean that heat can transfer from cold to hot places without external work, and such a heat transfer is impossible by the second law of thermodynamics. 

* It may seem odd that a hypothetical reversible heat pump with a low efficiency is used to violate the second law of thermodynamics, but the figure of merit for refrigerator units is not the efficiency, formula_19, but the coefficient of performance (COP), which is formula_20 where this formula_7 has the sign opposite to the above (+ for work done to the engine).

Let&#x27;s find the values of work formula_7and heat formula_8 depicted in the right figure in which a reversible heat engine formula_4 with a less efficiency formula_5 is driven as a heat pump by a heat engine formula_2 with a more efficiency formula_3.

The definition of the efficiency is formula_28 for each engine and the following expressions can be made:

:formula_29

:formula_30

The denominator of the second expression, formula_31, is made to make the expression to be consistent, and it helps to fill the values of work and heat for the engine formula_4.

For each engine, the absolute value of the energy entering the engine, formula_33, must be equal to the absolute value of the energy leaving from the engine, formula_34. Otherwise, energy is continuously accumulated in an engine or the conservation of energy is violated by taking more energy from an engine than input energy to the engine:

:formula_35

:formula_36

In the second expression, formula_37 is used to find the term formula_38 describing the amount of heat taken from the cold reservoir, completing the absolute value expressions of work and heat in the right figure.

Having established that the right figure values are correct, Carnot&#x27;s theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines as shown below.

===Reversible engines===
To see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs at temperatures formula_39 and formula_40 must have the same efficiency, assume that two reversible heat engines have different efficiencies, and let the relatively more efficient engine formula_2 drive the relatively less efficient engine formula_4 as a heat pump. As the right figure shows, this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without external work, which violates the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, both (reversible) heat engines have the same efficiency, and we conclude that:

:&quot;All reversible heat engines that operate between the same two thermal&quot; (&quot;heat&quot;) &quot;reservoirs have the same efficiency.&quot;

The reversible heat engine efficiency can be determined by analyzing a Carnot heat engine as one of reversible heat engine.

This conclusion is an important result because it helps establish the Clausius theorem, which implies that the change in entropy formula_43 is unique for all reversible processes:

:formula_44

as the entropy change, that is made during a transition from a thermodynamic equilibrium state formula_45 to a state formula_46 in a &quot;V-T&quot; (Volume-Temperature) space, is the same over all reversible process paths between these two states. If this integral were not path independent, then entropy would not be a state variable.

===Irreversible engines===
Consider two engines, formula_2 and formula_4, which are irreversible and reversible respectively. We construct the machine shown in the right figure, with formula_2 driving formula_4 as a heat pump. Then if formula_2 is more efficient than formula_4, the machine will violate the second law of thermodynamics. Since a Carnot heat engine is a reversible heat engine, and all reversible heat engines operate with the same efficiency between the same reservoirs, we have the first part of Carnot&#x27;s theorem:

:&quot;No irreversible heat engine is more efficient than a Carnot heat engine operating between the same two thermal reservoirs.&quot;

==Definition of thermodynamic temperature==

The efficiency of a heat engine is the work done by the engine divided by the heat introduced to the engine per engine cycle or
{q_H} = \frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_53 is the work done by the engine, formula_54 is the heat to the cold reservoir from the engine, and formula_55 is the heat to the engine from the hot reservoir, per cycle. Thus, the efficiency depends only on formula_56.

Because all reversible heat engines operating between temperatures formula_39 and formula_40 must have the same efficiency, the efficiency of a reversible heat engine is a function of only the two reservoir temperatures:
In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures formula_39 and formula_60 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between formula_39 and another (intermediate) temperature formula_40, and the second between formula_40 and formula_60 (formula_65). This can only be the case if
Specializing to the case that formula_39 is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water as 273.16. (Of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used — the choice here corresponds to the Kelvin scale.) Then for any formula_40 and formula_60,

:formula_69

Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by

:formula_70

then the function viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is
:formula_71
It follows immediately that

Substituting this equation back into the above equation formula_72 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of thermodynamic temperatures:

==Applicability to fuel cells==
Since fuel cells can generate useful power when all components of the system are at the same temperature (formula_73), they are clearly not limited by Carnot&#x27;s theorem, which states that no power can be generated when formula_74. This is because Carnot&#x27;s theorem applies to engines converting thermal energy to work, whereas fuel cells instead convert chemical energy to work. Nevertheless, the second law of thermodynamics still provides restrictions on fuel cell energy conversion.

A Carnot battery is a type of energy storage system that stores electricity in thermal energy storage and converts the stored heat back to electricity through thermodynamic cycles.

<text>In ancient Greece and Rome, a catamite (Latin: &quot;catamītus&quot;) was a pubescent boy who was the intimate companion of an older male, usually in a pederastic relationship. It was generally a term of affection and literally means &quot;Ganymede&quot; in Latin, but it was also used as a term of insult when directed toward a grown man. The word derives from the proper noun &quot;Catamitus&quot;, the Latinized form of Ganymede, the name of the beautiful Trojan youth abducted by Zeus to be his companion and cupbearer, according to Greek mythology. The Etruscan form of the name was &quot;Catmite&quot;, from an alternative Greek form of the name, &quot;Gadymedes&quot;.

In its modern usage, the term &quot;catamite&quot; refers to a boy as the passive or receiving partner in anal intercourse with a man.

==References in literature and popular culture==
*In Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Gorgias&quot; (at 494e), Socrates uses the phrase κιναίδων βίος (Catamite Life), in a conversation with Callicles contrasting appetites and contentment.
*The word appears widely but not necessarily frequently in the Latin literature of antiquity, from Plautus to Ausonius. It is sometimes a synonym for &quot;puer delicatus&quot;, &quot;delicate boy&quot;. Cicero uses the term as an insult. The word became a general term for a boy groomed for sexual purposes. It also appears in &quot;Meditations&quot; by Marcus Aurelius (Books 3.16, 5.10 and 6.34).
*Stephen Dedalus ponders the word in &quot;Ulysses&quot; when discussing accusations that William Shakespeare might have been a pederast.
*C. S. Lewis in his partial autobiography &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; described the social roles during his time at Wyvern College (by which he meant Malvern College) as including the role of &quot;Tart&quot;: &quot;a pretty and effeminate-looking small boy who acts as a catamite to one or more of his seniors ...&quot; and noted that &quot;pederasty ... was not [frowned upon as seriously as] wearing one&#x27;s coat unbuttoned.&quot; 
*Anthony Burgess&#x27;s 1980 novel &quot;Earthly Powers&quot; uses the word in its opening sentence: &quot;It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday, and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced that the archbishop had come to see me.&quot;
*In HBO&#x27;s TV series &quot;Rome&quot;, following the battle of Pharsalus, Julius Caesar admonishes Lucius Vorenus for letting Pompey Magnus escape, saying that Pompey might be &quot;broken like a Dacian catamite&quot; and yet still be dangerous. 
*In the post-apocalyptic landscape of Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Road&quot;, the narrator describes an army on the move on foot with &quot;women, perhaps a dozen in number, some of them pregnant, and lastly a supplementary consort of catamites&quot;.
*In &quot;South Park&quot; season 7 episode 8, &quot;South Park Is Gay!&quot;, Craig Tucker identifies himself as a catamite.
*On TikTok and other social media sites, from 2022-2023, the term &quot;Roman Towel Boy&quot; has seen a surge in popularity to describe young people (primarily women, but occasionally men) who are skinny, possess masculine facial traits and short hair, and have large eyes. The use of the term is an ahistorical representation of catamites, and is often leveled as an evaluation of a woman&#x27;s sexuality.

<doc id="308807" wikidata="Q2284425" url="?curid=308807" title="Shakespearean history">
<text>In the First Folio, the plays of William Shakespeare were grouped into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies. The histories—along with those of contemporary Renaissance playwrights—help define the genre of history plays. The Shakespearean histories are biographies of English kings of the previous four centuries and include the standalones &quot;King John&quot;, &quot;Edward III&quot; and &quot;Henry VIII&quot; as well as a continuous sequence of eight plays. These last are considered to have been composed in two cycles. The so-called first tetralogy, apparently written in the early 1590s, covers the Wars of the Roses saga and includes &quot;Henry VI, Parts I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; &amp; &quot;III&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. The second tetralogy, finished in 1599 and including &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Parts I&quot; &amp; &quot;II&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;, is frequently called the &quot;Henriad&quot; after its protagonist Prince Hal, the future Henry V.

The folio&#x27;s classifications are not unproblematic. Besides proposing other categories such as romances and problem plays, many modern studies treat the histories together with those tragedies that feature historical characters. These include &quot;Macbeth&quot;, set in the mid-11th century during the reigns of Duncan I of Scotland and Edward the Confessor and the legendary &quot;King Lear&quot; and also the Roman plays &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.

==List of Shakespeare&#x27;s histories==

===English histories===
As they are in the First Folio, the plays are listed here in the sequence of their action, rather than the order of the plays&#x27; composition. Short forms of the full titles are used.
* &quot;King John&quot; 
* &quot;Edward III&quot;
* &quot;Richard II&quot;
* &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;
* &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;
* &quot;Henry V&quot;
* &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;
* &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;
* &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;
* &quot;Richard III&quot;
* &quot;Henry VIII&quot;

===Roman histories===
As noted above, the First Folio groups these with the tragedies.
* &quot;Coriolanus&quot;
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;
* &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;
Set in ancient Rome, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; dramatises a fictional story and is therefore excluded as a Roman history.

===Other histories===
As with the Roman plays, the First Folio groups these with the tragedies. Although they are connected with regional royal biography, and based on similar sources, they are usually not considered part of Shakespeare&#x27;s English histories.
* &quot;King Lear&quot;
* &quot;Macbeth&quot;
* &quot;Hamlet&quot;

==Sources==
The source for most of the English history plays, as well as for &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;, is the well-known Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; of English history. The source for the Roman history plays is Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans Compared Together&quot;, in the translation made by Sir Thomas North in 1579. Shakespeare&#x27;s historical plays focus on only a small part of the characters&#x27; lives, and also frequently omit significant events for dramatic purposes.

==Politics in the English history plays==
Shakespeare was living in the reign of Elizabeth I, the last monarch of the House of Tudor, and his history plays are often regarded as Tudor propaganda because they show the dangers of civil war and celebrate the founders of the Tudor dynasty. In particular, &quot;Richard III&quot; depicts the last member of the rival House of York as an evil monster (&quot;that bottled spider, that foul bunchback&#x27;d toad&quot;), a depiction disputed by many modern historians, while portraying his successor, Henry VII, in glowing terms. Political bias is also clear in &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, which ends with an effusive celebration of the birth of Elizabeth. However, Shakespeare&#x27;s celebration of Tudor order is less important in these plays than his presentation of the spectacular decline of the medieval world. Some of Shakespeare&#x27;s histories—notably &quot;Richard III&quot;—point out that this medieval world came to its end when opportunism and Machiavellianism infiltrated its politics. By nostalgically evoking the Late Middle Ages, these plays described the political and social evolution that had led to the actual methods of Tudor rule, so that it is possible to consider the English history plays as a biased criticism of their own country.

===Lancaster, York, and Tudor myths===

Shakespeare made use of the Lancaster and York myths, as he found them in the chronicles, as well as the Tudor myth. The &#x27;Lancaster myth&#x27; regarded Richard II&#x27;s overthrow and Henry IV&#x27;s reign as providentially sanctioned, and Henry V&#x27;s achievements as a divine favour. The &#x27;York myth&#x27; saw Edward IV&#x27;s deposing of the ineffectual Henry VI as a providential restoration of the usurped throne to the lawful heirs of Richard II. The &#x27;Tudor myth&#x27; formulated by the historians and poets recognised Henry VI as a lawful king, condemned the York brothers for killing him and Prince Edward, and stressed the hand of divine providence in the Yorkist fall and in the rise of Henry Tudor, whose uniting of the houses of Lancaster and York had been prophesied by the &#x27;saintly&#x27; Henry VI. Henry Tudor&#x27;s deposing of Richard III &quot;was justified on the principles of contemporary political theory, for Henry was not merely rebelling against a tyrant but putting down a tyrannous &quot;usurper&quot;, which &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot; allowed&quot;. Because Henry Tudor prayed before Bosworth Field to be God&#x27;s minister of punishment, won the battle and attributed victory to Providence, the Tudor myth asserted that his rise was sanctioned by divine authority.

The later chroniclers, especially Polydore Vergil, Edward Hall and Raphael Holinshed, were not interested in &#x27;justifying&#x27; the Tudor regime by asserting the role of Providence; instead they stressed the lessons to be learned from the workings of Providence in the past, sometimes endorsing contradictory views of men and events for the sake of the different lessons these suggested, sometimes slanting their interpretations to draw a parallel with, or a moral for, their time. Consequently, though Hall in his &quot;Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancastre and Yorke&quot; (1548) saw God&#x27;s curse laid upon England for the deposing and murder of Richard II, God finally relenting and sending peace in the person and dynasty of Henry Tudor, and though Holinshed&#x27;s final judgement was that Richard, Duke of York and his line were divinely punished for violating his oath to let Henry VI live out his reign, the chroniclers tended to incorporate elements &quot;of all three myths&quot; in their treatment of the period from Richard II to Henry VII. For Shakespeare&#x27;s use of the three myths, see Interpretations.

==Interpretations==

===Shakespeare&#x27;s double tetralogy===
H. A. Kelly in &quot;Divine Providence in the England of Shakespeare&#x27;s Histories&quot; (1970) examines political bias and assertions of the workings of Providence in (a) the contemporary chronicles, (b) the Tudor historians, and (c) the Elizabethan poets, notably Shakespeare in his two tetralogies, (in composition-order) &quot;Henry VI&quot; to &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Richard II&quot; to &quot;Henry V&quot;. According to Kelly, Shakespeare&#x27;s great contribution, writing as a historiographer-dramatist, was to eliminate the supposedly objective providential judgements of his sources, and to distribute them to appropriate spokesmen in the plays, presenting them as mere opinion. Thus the sentiments of the Lancaster myth are spoken by Lancastrians, the opposing myth is voiced by Yorkists, and the Tudor myth is embodied in Henry Tudor. Shakespeare &quot;thereby allows each play to create its own ethos and mythos and to offer its own hypotheses concerning the springs of action&quot;.

Where the chronicles sought to explain events in terms of divine justice, Shakespeare plays down this explanation. Richard, Duke of York, for example, in his speech to Parliament about his claim, placed great stress, according to the chronicles, on providential justice; Shakespeare&#x27;s failure to make use of this theme in the parliament scene at the start of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, Kelly argues, &quot;would seem to amount to an outright rejection of it&quot;. In the first tetralogy, Henry VI never views his troubles as a case of divine retribution; in the second tetralogy, evidence for an overarching theme of providential punishment of Henry IV &quot;is completely lacking&quot;. Among the few allusions in the plays to hereditary providential punishment are Richard II&#x27;s prediction, at his abdication, of civil war, Henry IV&#x27;s fear of punishment through his wayward son, Henry V&#x27;s fear of punishment for his father&#x27;s sins, and Clarence&#x27;s fear of divine retribution meted out on his children. Again, where the chronicles argue that God was displeased with Henry VI&#x27;s marriage to Margaret and the broken vow to the Armagnac girl, Shakespeare has Duke Humphrey object to Margaret because the match entails the loss of Anjou and Maine. (Kelly dismisses the view of E. M. W. Tillyard and A. S. Cairncross of Margaret as the diabolical successor to Joan of Arc in England&#x27;s punishment by God.) As for suggestions of a &quot;benevolent&quot; Providence, Shakespeare does appear to adopt the chronicles&#x27; view that Talbot&#x27;s victories were due to divine aid, where Joan of Arc&#x27;s were down to devilish influence, but in reality he lets the audience see that &quot;she has simply outfoxed [Talbot] by superior military strategy&quot;. (Talbot&#x27;s eventual defeat and death are blamed in Shakespeare not on Joan but on dissention among the English.) In place of providential explanations, Shakespeare often presents events more in terms of &quot;poetic justice&quot; or Senecan dramaturgy. Dreams, prophecies and curses, for example, loom large in the earlier tetralogy and &quot;are dramatized as taking effect&quot;, among them Henry VI&#x27;s prophecy about the future Henry VII.
Accordingly, Shakespeare&#x27;s moral characterisation and political bias, Kelly argues, change from play to play, &quot;which indicates that he is not concerned with the absolute fixing of praise or blame&quot;, though he does achieve general consistency within each play:

:Many of his changes in characterisation must be blamed upon the inconsistencies of the chroniclers before him. For this reason, the moral conflicts of each play must be taken &quot;in terms of that play, and not supplemented from the other plays&quot;.

Shakespeare meant each play primarily to be self-contained. Thus in &quot;Richard II&quot; the murder of Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, inaugurates the action—John of Gaunt places the guilt on Richard II—but Woodstock is forgotten in the later plays. Again, Henry IV, at the end of &quot;Richard II&quot;, speaks of a crusade as reparation for Richard&#x27;s death: but in the next two plays he does not show remorse for his treatment of Richard. As for the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, the Yorkist view of history in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; differs from that in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;: in Part 1 the conspiracy of the Yorkist Richard Earl of Cambridge against Henry V is admitted; in Part 2 it is passed silently over. Henry VI&#x27;s attitude to his own claim undergoes changes. &quot;Richard III&quot; does not refer to &quot;any&quot; events prior to Henry VI&#x27;s reign.

Kelly finds evidence of Yorkist bias in the earlier tetralogy. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; has a Yorkist slant in the dying Mortimer&#x27;s narration to Richard Plantagenet (later Duke of York). Henry VI is weak and vacillating and overburdened by piety; neither Yorkists nor Queen Margaret think him fit to be king. The Yorkist claim is put so clearly that Henry admits, aside, that his own is weak—&quot;the first time,&quot; notes Kelly, &quot;that such an admission is conjectured in the historical treatment of the period&quot;. Shakespeare is suggestively silent in Part 3 on the Yorkist Earl of Cambridge&#x27;s treachery in Henry V&#x27;s reign. Even loyal Exeter admits to Henry VI that Richard II could not have resigned the crown legitimately to anyone but the heir, Mortimer. Edward (later IV) tells his father York that his oath to Henry was invalid because Henry had no authority to act as magistrate.

As for Lancastrian bias, York is presented as unrighteous and hypocritical in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, and while Part 2 ends with Yorkist victories and the capture of Henry, Henry still appears &quot;the upholder of right in the play&quot;. In &quot;Richard III&quot; in the long exchange between Clarence and the assassins we learn that not only Clarence but also implicitly the murderers and Edward IV himself consider Henry VI to have been their lawful sovereign. The Duchess of York&#x27;s lament that her family &quot;make war upon themselves, brother to brother, blood to blood, self against self&quot; derives from Vergil and Hall&#x27;s judgment that the York brothers paid the penalty for murdering King Henry and Prince Edward. In the later tetralogy Shakespeare clearly inclines towards the Lancaster myth. He makes no mention of Edmund Mortimer, Richard&#x27;s heir, in &quot;Richard II&quot;, an omission which strengthens the Lancastrian claim. The plan in &quot;Henry IV&quot; to divide the kingdom in three undermines Mortimer&#x27;s credibility. The omission of Mortimer from &quot;Henry V&quot; was again quite deliberate: Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry V has no doubt about his own claim. Rebellion is presented as unlawful and wasteful in the second tetralogy: as Blunt says to Hotspur, &quot;out of limit and true rule / You stand against anointed majesty&quot;.

Shakespeare&#x27;s retrospective verdict, however, on the reign of Henry VI, given in the epilogue to &quot;Henry V&quot;, is politically neutral: &quot;so many had the managing&quot; of the state that &quot;they lost France and made his England bleed&quot;. In short, though Shakespeare &quot;often accepts the moral portraitures of the chronicles which were originally produced by political bias, and has his characters commit or confess to crimes which their enemies falsely accused them of&quot; (&quot;Richard III&quot; being perhaps a case in point), his distribution of the moral and spiritual judgements of the chronicles to various spokesmen creates, Kelly believes, a more impartial presentation of history.

===Shakespearean history in the wider sense===
John F. Danby in &quot;Shakespeare’s Doctrine of Nature&quot; (1949) examines the response of Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays (in the widest sense) to the vexed question: &#x27;When is it right to rebel?’, and concludes that Shakespeare&#x27;s thought ran through three stages: (1) In the Wars of the Roses plays, &quot;Henry VI&quot; to &quot;Richard III&quot;, Shakespeare shows a new thrustful godlessness attacking the pious medieval structure represented by Henry VI. He implies that rebellion against a legitimate and pious king is wrong, and that only a monster such as Richard of Gloucester would have attempted it. (2) In &quot;King John&quot; and the &quot;Richard II&quot; to &quot;Henry V&quot; cycle, Shakespeare comes to terms with the Machiavellianism of the times as he saw them under Elizabeth. In these plays he adopts the official Tudor ideology, by which rebellion, even against a wrongful usurper, is never justifiable. (3) From &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; onwards, Shakespeare justifies tyrannicide, but in order to do so moves away from English history to the camouflage of Roman, Danish, Scottish or Ancient British history.
Danby argues that Shakespeare&#x27;s study of the Machiavel is key to his study of history. His Richard III, Faulconbridge in &quot;King John&quot;, Hal and Falstaff are all Machiavels, characterised in varying degrees of frankness by the pursuit of &quot;Commodity&quot; (i.e. advantage, profit, expediency). Shakespeare at this point in his career pretends that the Hal-type Machiavellian prince is admirable and the society he represents historically inevitable. Hotspur and Hal are joint heirs, one medieval, the other modern, of a split Faulconbridge. Danby argues, however, that when Hal rejects Falstaff he is not reforming, as is the common view, but merely turning from one social level to another, from Appetite to Authority, both of which are equally part of the corrupt society of the time. Of the two, Danby argues, Falstaff is the preferable, being, in every sense, the bigger man. In &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; there is a similar conflict between rival Machiavels: the noble Brutus is a dupe of his Machiavellian associates, while Antony&#x27;s victorious &quot;order&quot;, like Hal&#x27;s, is a negative thing. In &quot;Hamlet&quot; king-killing becomes a matter of private rather than public morality—the individual&#x27;s struggles with his own conscience and fallibility take centre stage. Hamlet, like Edgar in &quot;King Lear&quot; later, has to become a &quot;machiavel of goodness&quot;. In &quot;Macbeth&quot; the interest is again public, but the public evil flows from Macbeth&#x27;s primary rebellion against his own nature. &quot;The root of the machiavelism lies in a wrong choice. Macbeth is clearly aware of the great frame of Nature he is violating.&quot;

&quot;King Lear&quot;, in Danby&#x27;s view, is Shakespeare&#x27;s finest historical allegory. The older medieval society, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new Machiavellianism; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king&#x27;s rejected daughter. By the time he reaches Edmund, Shakespeare no longer pretends that the Hal-type Machiavellian prince is admirable; and in &quot;Lear&quot; he condemns the society which is thought to be historically inevitable. Against this he holds up the ideal of a transcendent community and reminds the audience of the &quot;true needs&quot; of a humanity to which the operations of a Commodity-driven society perpetually do violence. This &quot;new&quot; thing that Shakespeare discovers is embodied in Cordelia. The play thus offers an alternative to the feudal–Machiavellian polarity, an alternative foreshadowed in France&#x27;s speech (I.1.245–256), in Lear and Gloucester&#x27;s prayers (III.4. 28–36; IV.1.61–66), and in the figure of Cordelia. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person, an ethical principle (love), and a community. Until that decent society is achieved, we are meant to take as role-model Edgar, the Machiavel of patience, of courage and of &quot;ripeness&quot;. After &quot;King Lear&quot; Shakespeare&#x27;s view seems to be that private goodness can be permanent only in a decent society.

==Shakespeare and the chronicle play genre==
===Dates and themes===
Chronicle plays—history-plays based on the chronicles of Polydore Vergil, Edward Hall, Raphael Holinshed and others—enjoyed great popularity from the late 1580s to c. 1606. By the early 1590s they were more numerous and more popular than plays of any other kind. John Bale&#x27;s morality play &quot;Kynge Johan&quot; [:&quot;King John&quot;], c. 1547, is sometimes considered a forerunner of the genre. King John was of interest to 16th century audiences because he had opposed the Pope; two further plays were written about him in the late 16th century, one of them Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Life and Death of King John&quot;. Patriotic feeling at the time of the Spanish Armada contributed to the appeal of chronicle plays on the Hundred Years&#x27; War, notably Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy, while unease over the succession at the close of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign made plays based on earlier dynastic struggles from the reign of Richard II to the Wars of the Roses topical. Plays about the deposing and killing of kings, or about civil dissension, met with much interest in the 1590s, while plays dramatising supposedly factual episodes from the past, advertised as &quot;true history&quot; (though the dramatist might know otherwise), drew larger audiences than plays with imagined plots.

The chronicle play, however, always came under close scrutiny by the Elizabethan and Jacobean authorities. Playwrights were banned from touching &quot;matters of divinity or state&quot;, a ban that remained in force throughout the period, the Master of Revels acting as licenser. The deposition scene in &quot;Richard II&quot; (IV.i.154–318), for example, almost certainly part of the play as it was originally written, was omitted from the early quartos (1597, 1598, 1608) and presumably performances, on grounds of prudence, and not fully reinstated till the First Folio. The chronicle play, as a result, tended ultimately to endorse the principles of &#x27;Degree&#x27;, order, and legitimate royal prerogative, and so was valued by the authorities for its didactic effect. Some have suggested that history plays were quietly subsidised by the state, for propaganda purposes. The annual grant of a thousand pounds by the Queen to the Earl of Oxford from 1586 was, it has been argued, &quot;meant to assist him as theatrical entrepreneur for the Court, in such a way that it would not become known that the Queen was offering substantial backing to the acting companies&quot;. Oxford was to support plays &quot;which would educate the English people ... in their country&#x27;s history, in appreciation of its greatness, and of their own stake in its welfare&quot;. Whether coincidence or not, a spate of history plays followed the authorization of the annuity. B. M. Ward pointed out (1928) that the elaborated, unhistorical and flattering role assigned to an earlier Earl of Oxford, the 11th, in &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot; (c. 1587), was designed as an oblique compliment to a contemporary financial backer of chronicle plays. By contrast, a less heroic ancestor of Oxford&#x27;s, Robert de Vere, the 9th earl, who deserted at the Battle of Radcot Bridge, is left out of &quot;Thomas of Woodstock&quot;, which deals with the first part of Richard II&#x27;s reign, though he was one of the king&#x27;s early circle of favourites and a contemporary of Robert Tresilian, the play&#x27;s villain.

===Development===
The early chronicle plays such as &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth&quot; were, like the chronicles themselves, loosely structured, haphazard, episodic; battles and pageantry, spirits, dreams and curses, added to their appeal. The scholar H. B. Charlton gave some idea of their shortcomings when he spoke of &quot;the wooden patriotism of &quot;The Famous Victories&quot;, the crude and vulgar &quot;Life and Death of Jack Straw&quot;, the flatness of &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot;, and the clumsy and libellous &quot;Edward I&quot; &quot;. Under the influence of Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine&quot;, however, c. 1587, with its lofty poetry and its focus on a single unifying figure, of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Contention&quot; plays, c. 1589–90, and of the machiavels of revenge tragedy, chronicle-plays rapidly became more sophisticated in characterisation, structure, and style. Marlowe himself turned to English history as a result of the success of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Contention&quot;. In &quot;Edward II&quot;, c. 1591, he moved from the rhetoric and spectacle of &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; to &quot;the interplay of human character&quot;, showing how chronicle material could be compressed and rearranged, and bare hints turned to dramatic effect.

Shakespeare then took the genre further, bringing deeper insights to bear on the nature of politics, kingship, war and society. He also brought noble poetry to the genre and a deep knowledge of human character. In particular, he took a greater interest than Marlowe in women in history, and portrayed them with more subtlety. In interpreting events in terms of character, more than in terms of Providence or Fortune, or of mechanical social forces, Shakespeare could be said to have had a &quot;philosophy of history&quot;. With his genius for comedy he worked up in a comic vein chronicle material such as Cade&#x27;s revolt and the youth of Prince Hal; with his genius for invention, he largely created vital figures like Fauconbridge (if &quot;The Troublesome Reign&quot; was his) and Falstaff. His chronicle plays, taken together in historical order, have been described as constituting a &quot;great national epic&quot;. Argument for possible Shakespearean authorship or part-authorship of &quot;Edward III&quot; and &quot;Thomas of Woodstock&quot; has in recent years sometimes led to the inclusion of these plays in the Shakespeare cycle.

Uncertainty about composition-dates and authorship of the early chronicle plays makes it difficult to attribute influence or give credit for initiating the genre. Some critics believe that Shakespeare has a fair claim to have been the innovator. In 1944 E. M. W. Tillyard argued that &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth&quot;, c. 1586–87, could have been a work of Shakespeare&#x27;s apprenticeship, a claim developed by Seymour Pitcher in 1961. Pitcher argued that annotations to a copy Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancastre and Yorke&quot; that was discovered in 1940 (the volume is now in the British Library) were probably written by Shakespeare and that these are very close to passages in the play. Again, W. J. Courthope (1905), E. B. Everitt (1965) and Eric Sams (1995) argued that &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot;, c. 1588–89, was Shakespeare&#x27;s early version of the play later rewritten as &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot; (the Second Quarto, 1611, had attributed &quot;The Troublesome Reign&quot; to &quot;W.Sh.&quot;). Sams called &quot;The Troublesome Reign&quot; &quot;the first modern history play&quot;. Everitt and Sams also believed that two early chronicle plays based on Holinshed and dramatising 11th century English history, &quot;Edmund Ironside, or War Hath Made All Friends&quot;, written c. 1588–89, and its lost sequel &quot;Hardicanute&quot;, performed in the 1590s, were by Shakespeare. A rival claimant to be the first English chronicle play is &quot;The True Tragedie of Richard the Third&quot;, of unknown authorship from the same period. In practice, however, playwrights were both &#x27;influencers&#x27; and influenced: Shakespeare&#x27;s two &quot;Contention&quot; plays (1589–90), influenced by Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; (1587), in turn influenced Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot;, which itself influenced Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;.

Of later chronicle plays, T. S. Eliot considered Ford&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle History of Perkin Warbeck&quot; &quot;unquestionably [his] highest achievement&quot; and &quot;one of the very best historical plays outside of the works of Shakespeare in the whole of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama.&quot; Chronicle plays based on the history of other countries were also written during this period, among them Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot;, Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Charles, Duke of Biron&quot;, Webster&#x27;s lost &quot;Guise&quot;, and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. In some of the chronicle-based plays, as the various contemporary title-pages show, the genres of &#x27;chronicle history&#x27; and &#x27;tragedy&#x27; overlap.

===Decline===
Several causes led to the decline of the chronicle play in the early 17th century: a degree of satiety (many more chronicle plays were produced than the surviving ones listed below); a growing awareness of the unreliability of the genre as history; the vogue for &#x27;Italianate&#x27; subject-matter (Italian, Spanish or French plots); the vogue for satirical drama of contemporary life (&#x27;city comedy&#x27;); the movement among leading dramatists, including Shakespeare, away from populism and towards more sophisticated court-centred tastes; the decline in national homogeneity with the coming of the Stuarts, and in the &#x27;national spirit&#x27;, that ended in civil war and the closing of the theatres (1642). Some of these factors are touched on by Ford in his Prologue to &quot;Perkin Warbeck&quot; (c. 1630), a defence of the chronicle play.

The above tables include both the Quarto and the Folio versions of &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Henry VI&quot; Parts 2 and 3, because the Quartos may preserve early versions of these three plays (as opposed to &#x27;corrupted&#x27; texts). They exclude chronicle-type plays now lost, like &quot;Hardicanute&quot;, the probable sequel to &quot;Edmund Ironside&quot;, and plays based on legend, such as the anonymous &quot;True Chronicle History of King Leir and his three daughters&quot;, c. 1587, and Anthony Munday&#x27;s two plays on Robin Hood, &quot;The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington&quot; and &quot;The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington&quot;.

==Shakespeare and the Roman history play genre==
Late 16th and early 17th century &#x27;Roman history&#x27; plays—English plays based on episodes in Virgil, Livy, Tacitus, Sallust, and Plutarch—were, to varying degrees, successful on stage from the late 1580s to the 1630s. Their appeal lay partly in their exotic spectacle, partly in their unfamiliar plots, partly in the way they could explore topical themes safely detached from an English context. In &quot;Appius and Virginia&quot; (c. 1626), for example, John Webster added a non-historical episode (the only one in the play) about the starvation of Roman troops in the field by the neglect of the home authorities, to express his rage at the abandonment and death by starvation of the English army in the Low Countries in 1624–25. Dangerous themes such as rebellion and tyrannicide, ancient freedoms versus authoritarian rule, civic duty versus private ambition, could be treated more safely through Roman history, as Shakespeare treated them in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. Character and moral values (especially &#x27;Roman values&#x27;) could be explored outside an inhibiting Christian framework.

Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and his pseudo-historical &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; were among the more successful and influential of Roman history plays. Among the less successful was Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus His Fall&quot;, the 1604 performance of which at the Globe was &quot;hissed off the stage&quot;. Jonson, misunderstanding the genre, had &quot;confined himself to the dramatization of recorded fact, and refused to introduce anything for which he did not have historical warrant&quot;, thus failing to construct a satisfactory plot. According to Park Honan, Shakespeare&#x27;s own later Roman work, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, carefully avoided &quot;&quot;Sejanus&quot;″s clotted style, lack of irony, and grinding moral emphasis&quot;.


* The above tables exclude Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; (composed c. 1589, revised c. 1593), which is not closely based on Roman history or legend but which, it has been suggested, may have been written in reply to Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Dido, Queene of Carthage&quot;, Marlowe&#x27;s play presenting an idealised picture of Rome&#x27;s origins, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;a terrible picture of Rome&#x27;s end, collapsing into moral anarchy&quot;.

==The &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot; cycle on stage and in film==
&quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; is a phrase used to describe the civil wars in England between the Lancastrian and Yorkist dynasties. Some of the events of these wars were dramatised by Shakespeare in the history plays &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, and &quot;Richard III&quot;. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries there have been numerous stage performances, including:
# The first tetralogy (&quot;Henry VI&quot; parts 1 to 3 and &quot;Richard III&quot;) as a cycle;
# The second tetralogy (&quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Henry IV&quot; parts 1 and 2 and &quot;Henry V&quot;) as a cycle (which has also been referred to as the Henriad); and
# The entire eight plays in historical order (the second tetralogy followed by the first tetralogy) as a cycle. Where this full cycle is performed, as by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1964, the name &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; has often been used for the cycle as a whole.
# A conflation of the eight plays by Tom Wright and Benedict Andrews, under the title &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;, was performed by the Sydney Theatre Company in 2009.

The tetralogies have been filmed for television five times, twice as the entire cycle:

# for the 1960 UK serial &quot;An Age of Kings&quot; directed by Michael Hayes. Featuring David William as Richard II, Tom Fleming as Henry IV, Robert Hardy as Henry V, Terry Scully as Henry VI, Paul Daneman as Richard III, Julian Glover as Edward IV, Mary Morris as Queen Margaret, Judi Dench as Princess Catherine, Eileen Atkins as Joan la Pucelle, Frank Pettingell as Falstaff, William Squire as The Chorus and Justice Shallow, and, Sean Connery as Hotspur.
# for the 1965 UK serial &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;, based on the RSC&#x27;s 1964 staging of the Second Tetralogy, which condensed the Henry VI plays into two plays called &quot;Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Edward IV&quot;. adapted by John Barton and Peter Hall; and directed by Hall. Featuring Ian Holm as Richard III, David Warner as Henry VI, Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret, Donald Sinden as York, Roy Dotrice as Edward and Jack Cade, Janet Suzman as Joan and Lady Anne and William Squire as Buckingham and Suffolk.
# Second Tetralogy filmed for the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; in 1978/1979 directed by David Giles. &quot;Richard II&quot; was filmed as a stand-alone piece for the first season of the series, with the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays and &quot;Henry V&quot; filmed as a trilogy for the second season. Featuring Derek Jacobi as Richard II, John Gielgud as John of Gaunt, Jon Finch as Henry IV, Anthony Quayle as Falstaff, David Gwillim as Henry V, Tim Pigott-Smith as Hotspur, Charles Gray as York, Wendy Hiller as the Duchess of Gloucester, Brenda Bruce as Mistress Quickly, and Michele Dotrice as Lady Percy.
# First Tetralogy filmed for the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; in 1981 directed by Jane Howell, although the episodes didn&#x27;t air until 1983. In the First Tetralogy, the plays are performed as if by a repertory theater company, with the same actors appearing in different parts in each play. Featuring Ron Cook as Richard III, Peter Benson as Henry VI, Brenda Blethyn as Joan, Bernard Hill as York, Julia Foster as Margaret, Brian Protheroe as Edward, Paul Jesson as Clarence, Mark Wing-Davey as Warwick, Frank Middlemass as Cardinal Beaufort, Trevor Peacock as Talbot and Jack Cade, Paul Chapman as Suffolk and Rivers, David Burke as Gloucester and Zoe Wanamaker as Lady Anne.
# for a straight-to-video filming, directly from the stage, of the English Shakespeare Company&#x27;s 1987 production of &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; directed by Michael Bogdanov and Michael Pennington. Featuring Pennington as Richard II, Henry V, Buckingham, Jack Cade and Suffolk, Andrew Jarvis as Richard III, Hotspur and the Dauphin, Barry Stanton as Falstaff, The Duke of York and the Chorus in Henry V, Michael Cronin as Henry IV and the Earl of Warwick, Paul Brennan as Henry VI and Pistol, and June Watson as Queen Margaret and Mistress Quickly. The three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays are condensed into two plays, bearing the subtitles &quot;Henry VI: House of Lancaster&quot; and &quot;Henry VI: House of York&quot;.
# Second Tetralogy filmed as &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; for BBC2 in 2012 directed by Rupert Goold (&quot;Richard II&quot;), Richard Eyre (&quot;Henry IV, Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot;) and Thea Sharrock (&quot;Henry V&quot;). Featuring Ben Whishaw as Richard II, Patrick Stewart as John of Gaunt, Rory Kinnear as Henry Bolingbroke (in &quot;Richard II&quot;) and Jeremy Irons as Henry IV, Tom Hiddleston as Henry V, Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff, Joe Armstrong as Hotspur, and Julie Walters as Mistress Quickly. The first tetralogy was later adapted in 2016.

Many of the plays have also been filmed stand-alone, outside of the cycle at large. Famous examples include &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944), directed by and starring Laurence Olivier, and &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh; &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955), directed by and starring Olivier, and &quot;Richard III&quot; (1995), directed by Richard Loncraine and starring Ian McKellen; and &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1965) (also known as &quot;Falstaff&quot;), directed by and starring Orson Welles, combining &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and &quot;Part II&quot;, with some scenes from &quot;Henry V&quot;.

<text>Hoeven is a village in the municipality of Halderberge in the Netherlands. The name Hoeven originated from the purchase of a certain amount of ground in 1282 by the abbey of Cistercians of St. Bernard. This amount was equal to 100 &quot;hoeven&quot;, a local measure of area in those days. A hoeve is approximately 12 bunder. A &quot;bunder&quot; equals the area of the average agricultural farm in the Netherlands.

== Municipality of Hoeven ==

Hoeven was a separate municipality until 1997 including the three villages of Bosschenhoofd, Hoeven and Kruisstraat. In 1997 the municipality of Hoeven became a part of Halderberge.

== Different names ==

Though the village officially is named Hoeven, most civilians use and pronounce it as &quot;Oeve&quot; or &quot;d&#x27;Oeve&quot; as &#x27;Hoeven&#x27; is pronounced in the local dialect, Brabants. Remarkable in the southern parts of the Netherlands, where they officially celebrate carnival, is that during this period all places change names during this seven-day celebration. In case of Hoeven it is known in this period as &quot;Peejenland&quot; which means &quot;Land of the Carrots&quot;. Before the name may be changed the Mayor must hand the key of the village to the Prince of Carnival (&quot;Prins Carnaval&quot;) and this way he gives the Prince the leadership of the village. At the end of Carnaval the Princess gives the key back to the Mayor and the village welcomes boards change back to the original.

== Flag ==

The official flag of Hoeven is composed of two color in a diagonal line from left under to right above. Remarkable point is that the border line between those points isn&#x27;t straight but wave-shaped which is a rare sight in this area. The lowest part of the flag is yellow while the highest part is blue. In this blue part appears a yellow castle tower which could come from a castle that was located in the center of Hoeven in history. Recently at construction works at the old Mayorhouse there were ruins and graves discover of an unknown centuries old large building with towers. The construction works are delayed for historical research on the ruin. The shape of the castle in the flag of Hoeven also comes back in the flag of the municipal &quot;Halderberge&quot;.

== Symbol ==

The symbol of Hoeven is &quot;de Peejenzaaier&quot; (the carrotsower). Which is pictured as a bronze statue at the main square in the center of the village.

== Location ==

Hoeven is situated between the bigger cities of Roosendaal and Breda, near the smaller city Etten-Leur. The center street of Hoeven is built on a small hill called the &quot;Halderberg&quot;. Which is remarkable since the rest of the areas landscape is extremely flat. To the north Hoeven finds a natural border with the river &quot;De Mark&quot;, which is also the border of the municipality with Zevenbergen. The village of Hoeven has a surface of 24,82 km2 and in 2007 counted 6,560 civilians.

Hoeven also contains two pieces of polder:
* The biggest polder is the &quot;Hoevense Beemde&quot; which was founded at 12 June 1409 when the abbot of &quot;Sint Bernardus&quot; offered a large piece of land to the public. A big percentage of this area was sold to people from Moerdijk who used the land to win peat. This caused much danger for floods because the river &quot;De Mark&quot; was nearby, so the area of the &quot;Hoevense Beemden&quot; was protected by building dykes around it.
* The &quot;Sint Maartenspolder&quot; was a piece of land that was owned by the abbot of &quot;Sint Bernardus&quot; which released this piece of land that had been slibt over the years 8 October 1483. It was named after the patron saint &quot;Sint Maarten&quot;.

== Sights ==
* Great seminar Bovendonk
The great seminar Bovendonk is located in the center of Hoeven. In the year 1282 the abbey &quot;Sint Bernardus&quot; in Antwerp (Modern day Belgium) founded a new &quot;garden&quot; in Hoeven. In 1570 this garden became the property of the Bishop of Antwerp. In 1646 it lost his function as a Catholic church and it became Protestant and the first Pastor arrived. 1871 the great seminar of Breda moved from location to Hoeven and the great seminar Bovendonk was born. Because all the ground of the seminar was still property of the Dutch government, the seminar bought the complete amount of ground in 1892 for 14000 Guilder. Three years later the famous designer Petrus J.H. Cuypers designed a complete new seminar for this location and in 1907 the new seminar in neogotic style appeared. Due to the low amount of notifications for the Paster study the great seminar Bovendonk was abandoned in 1967 and left like this for the next 11 years. In 1990 first progress was made to commercialise the great seminar Bovendonk. In 2007 the 100th birthday of the great seminar was celebrated. These days it is in use as a conference center, hotel, exhibition and event center.

* Sint Jan de Baptist
The church &quot;Sint Jan de Bapist&quot; from 1929, designed by J.H. Berben in expressionistic style.

== Events ==

* Carnaval
As in all towns in the two southern provinces of the Netherlands carnival is also celebrated in Hoeven. Remarkable is that every town has its own rituals and happenings during this seven-day celebration. Very special is that Hoeven is the only village in the Netherlands that has a (legal) private radio station named Radio Peejenland during these 7 days.

* Carnavalsparade
Every year at the last Tuesday of carnival there is a carnivals parade in Hoeven. Though this is a well-known phenomenon, the parade of Hoeven highly ranked in the area because there are very strict rules for the competitors which leads to very high quality of the creations. So there is mainly paper used instead of polyester, which is mostly used in other areas.

* Trekkertrek
Trekkertrek, which means &quot;tractor pulling&quot;, is a sport where a tractor needs to pull a trailer which is becoming more and more heavy by the time the trucks gets further. These days many of these tractors are powered by engines from heavy machinery or even fighterjet engines.

* Fietsvierdaagse and Wandelvierdaagse
Two four-day tournaments where competitives need to walk or cycle a certain distance in four days in different categories. In the case of the cycling event (Fietsvierdaagse), people can choose from a distance of 25, 40, 60 or 100 kilometre per day. In the case of the walking event (Wandelvierdaagse) you can choose between 5, 10 or 15 kilometre distance per day. Once a competitive has managed to drive or walk the same distance for four days in a row they earn a medal.

* Muziekweekend
A music event that is held once or twice a year, organised by the local music organisation &quot;Sint Cecilea&quot;. At this event there are always 3 days organised with different international, national and regional music.

* Sint Maarten
During this celebration that is only celebrated in a few random areas of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and the North of France, there is always a fireworks show at the recreationpark &quot;Splesj!&quot;.

* Kermis
During the pinkster period there is a yearly Kermis (fair) held at the center of Hoeven.

* Koninginnedag
At Koninginnedag (Queensday) there is a national celebration of the birthday of the Queen (actually, it is the birthday of the mother of the queen). This means there is a parade through the village with a lot of orange colored vehicles. Orange being the national color of the Netherlands. Also there are multiple music and sport activities planned around the general celebration.

<text>Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that upheld the ability of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate indecent content sent over the broadcast airwaves.

== Background ==
On the afternoon of October 30, 1973, radio station WBAI in New York City, owned by the nonprofit Pacifica Foundation, aired a program about societal attitudes toward language and included the monologue &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot; by comedian George Carlin, from his 1972 album &quot;Class Clown&quot;. The broadcast included Carlin&#x27;s recitation of the words &quot;shit&quot;, &quot;piss&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;cunt&quot;, &quot;cocksucker&quot;, &quot;motherfucker&quot;, and &quot;tits&quot;.John Douglas, an active member of Morality in Media, filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) claiming that he had heard the broadcast on his car radio while driving with his young son, and that the content was inappropriate for minors per the FCC&#x27;s rules on indecency over the public broadcast airwaves. Douglas also noted that the material should not have been broadcast during the daytime (it was approximately 2:00pm) when minors were more likely to be listening, per the FCC&#x27;s rule requiring adult-oriented programming to only be broadcast during late-night hours. 

The FCC forwarded Douglas&#x27;s complaint to Pacifica Foundation for comment. The foundation replied that the program was intended to be educational, addressing public attitudes toward language, and that Carlin was &quot;a significant social satirist&quot; who &quot;like Twain and Sahl before him, examines the language of ordinary people... using words to satirize as harmless and essentially silly our attitudes towards those words.&quot; Pacifica also noted that it had received no other public complaints about the broadcast. 

In February 1975, the FCC issued a declaratory order stating that Pacifica and WBAI &quot;could have been the subject of administrative sanctions.&quot; While no such sanctions were enacted, the FCC recorded the incident in the station&#x27;s file for later consideration if there were customer complaints about the station in the future or if its broadcasting license was up for renewal. The order noted that regulations on indecent broadcast content had indeed been violated by WBAI. The order also explained that the Carlin routine was &quot;patently offensive&quot; and &quot;deliberately broadcast&quot; at a time when minors could have been listening, which were forbidden per the Communications Act of 1934.

Pacifica Foundation challenged the declaratory order, on First Amendment grounds, to the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. In March 1977, the circuit court reversed the FCC&#x27;s order against Pacifica, ruling it to be censorship of a type that was also prohibited by the Communications Act of 1934. The court also held that the order was overbroad by failing to define the public interest that it was trying to serve, beyond poorly-defined protection of an unknown number of children in the audience, while confusing the definition of obscenity (unacceptable for all audiences) as opposed to content that is merely indecent (acceptable for some audiences such as consenting adults).

Given the apparently conflicting provisions of the 1934 Act that were raised in the circuit court ruling, the FCC appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court accepted the case in 1978 and resolved to reconcile the Act&#x27;s restrictions on indecent broadcasting content with its prohibition of censorship.

== Supreme Court opinion ==
The Supreme Court primarily addressed the matter of whether government regulation of broadcasting content comports with the free speech rights of broadcast operators under the First Amendment. The high court ruled 5–4 in favor of the FCC, holding that the Carlin routine was &quot;indecent but not obscene&quot;. Therefore, the Commission could not ban such content outright, but it could restrict broadcasts to certain times of day. This was because the Commission had the authority to shield children from potentially offensive material, and to ensure that unwanted speech does not intrude on the privacy of one&#x27;s home. 

In light of First Amendment concerns, the high court held that government regulation of broadcasting content, when in the form of a partial restriction but not a total ban, is not considered censorship. This is because of the &quot;uniquely pervasive&quot; nature of the broadcast airwaves, that in turn are &quot;uniquely accessible to children&quot;. The court held that these two concerns were sufficient to &quot;justify special treatment of indecent broadcasting,&quot; thereby allowing the FCC to sanction broadcasters for airing inappropriate content that violates the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934. Thus, the Commission&#x27;s warning to Pacifica about broadcasting the Carlin routine in the afternoon was found to be an acceptable regulatory action.

If the Carlin routine had included obscenity, the FCC could have banned it from the broadcast airwaves outright. Since the routine was merely indecent (unacceptable for some audiences but acceptable for others), the FCC could not ban the content but could restrict it to certain times of day. This became known as the FCC&#x27;s safe harbor rule. 

The ruling gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts. Conversely, it would be acceptable for Pacifica or any other radio station to broadcast the Carlin routine, or any similarly indecent material, outside of the daytime safe harbor hours when vulnerable audiences like children are more likely to be listening.

== Impact ==
The &quot;Pacifica&quot; ruling is often cited as one of the most important precedents in American broadcasting law and the U.S. government&#x27;s ability to regulate mass media content. The case is also cited for clarifying the potential conflict between the government&#x27;s interest in protecting audiences and a broadcaster&#x27;s First Amendment rights, though the Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation is sometimes criticized for its inconsistency and inability to adapt to new media technologies or trends in popular content. The case is also an important precedent for determining the differences between obscene and indecent content and appropriate regulatory reactions to them.

George Carlin has been credited for his role in this turning point for the law. In 1997, Pacifica Radio host Larry Bensky prefaced an interview with Carlin by saying: &quot;George Carlin, you&#x27;re a very unusual guest for Pacifica Radio. You&#x27;re probably the only person in the United States that we don&#x27;t have to give The Carlin Warning to about which words you can&#x27;t say on this program, because it&#x27;s named after you.&quot;

Despite its victory in &quot;Pacifica&quot;, the FCC at first used its new safe harbor regulatory powers sparingly. In the 1990s, however, the FCC ramped up sanctions for indecent broadcasts. By the early 2000s, the Commission began to levy more sanctions with higher dollar amounts&quot;–&quot;with fines of up to $500,000 for some offenses. Such actions have been inconsistent and sometimes raise accusations of selective enforcement.

<text>In geometry, the notion of a connection makes precise the idea of transporting local geometric objects, such as tangent vectors or tensors in the tangent space, along a curve or family of curves in a &quot;parallel&quot; and consistent manner. There are various kinds of connections in modern geometry, depending on what sort of data one wants to transport. For instance, an affine connection, the most elementary type of connection, gives a means for parallel transport of tangent vectors on a manifold from one point to another along a curve. An affine connection is typically given in the form of a covariant derivative, which gives a means for taking directional derivatives of vector fields, measuring the deviation of a vector field from being parallel in a given direction.

Connections are of central importance in modern geometry in large part because they allow a comparison between the local geometry at one point and the local geometry at another point. Differential geometry embraces several variations on the connection theme, which fall into two major groups: the infinitesimal and the local theory. The local theory concerns itself primarily with notions of parallel transport and holonomy. The infinitesimal theory concerns itself with the differentiation of geometric data. Thus a covariant derivative is a way of specifying a derivative of a vector field along another vector field on a manifold. A Cartan connection is a way of formulating some aspects of connection theory using differential forms and Lie groups. An Ehresmann connection is a connection in a fibre bundle or a principal bundle by specifying the allowed directions of motion of the field. A Koszul connection is a connection which defines directional derivative for sections of a vector bundle more general than the tangent bundle.

Connections also lead to convenient formulations of &quot;geometric invariants&quot;, such as the curvature (see also curvature tensor and curvature form), and torsion tensor.

==Motivation: the unsuitability of coordinates==

Consider the following problem. Suppose that a tangent vector to the sphere &quot;S&quot; is given at the north pole, and we are to define a manner of consistently moving this vector to other points of the sphere: a means for &quot;parallel transport&quot;. Naively, this could be done using a particular coordinate system. However, unless proper care is applied, the parallel transport defined in one system of coordinates will not agree with that of another coordinate system. A more appropriate parallel transportation system exploits the symmetry of the sphere under rotation. Given a vector at the north pole, one can transport this vector along a curve by rotating the sphere in such a way that the north pole moves along the curve without axial rolling. This latter means of parallel transport is the Levi-Civita connection on the sphere. If two different curves are given with the same initial and terminal point, and a vector &quot;v&quot; is rigidly moved along the first curve by a rotation, the resulting vector at the terminal point will be &quot;different from&quot; the vector resulting from rigidly moving &quot;v&quot; along the second curve. This phenomenon reflects the curvature of the sphere. A simple mechanical device that can be used to visualize parallel transport is the south-pointing chariot.

For instance, suppose that &quot;S&quot; is a sphere given coordinates by the stereographic projection. Regard &quot;S&quot; as consisting of unit vectors in R3. Then &quot;S&quot; carries a pair of coordinate patches corresponding to the projections from north pole and south pole. The mappings
:formula_1
cover a neighborhood &quot;U&quot;0 of the north pole and &quot;U&quot;1 of the south pole, respectively. Let &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; be the ambient coordinates in R3. Then φ0 and φ1 have inverses
:formula_2
so that the coordinate transition function is inversion in the circle:

:formula_3

Let us now represent a vector field formula_4 on S (an assignment of a tangent vector to each point in S) in local coordinates. If &quot;P&quot; is a point of &quot;U&quot;0 ⊂ &quot;S&quot;, then a vector field may be represented by the pushforward of a vector field v0 on R2 by formula_5:

where formula_6 denotes the Jacobian matrix of φ0 (formula_7), and v0 = v0(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is a vector field on R2 uniquely determined by &quot;v&quot; (since the pushforward of a local diffeomorphism at any point is invertible). Furthermore, on the overlap between the coordinate charts &quot;U&quot;0 ∩ &quot;U&quot;1, it is possible to represent the same vector field with respect to the φ1 coordinates:

To relate the components v0 and v1, apply the chain rule to the identity φ1 = φ0 o φ01:

:formula_8

Applying both sides of this matrix equation to the component vector v1(φ1−1(&quot;P&quot;)) and invoking () and () yields
\left(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)\right) \cdot {\mathbf v}_1 \left(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)\right).&lt;/math&gt;|}}

We come now to the main question of defining how to transport a vector field parallelly along a curve. Suppose that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a curve in &quot;S&quot;. Naïvely, one may consider a vector field parallel if the coordinate components of the vector field are constant along the curve. However, an immediate ambiguity arises: in &quot;which&quot; coordinate system should these components be constant?

For instance, suppose that &quot;v&quot;(&quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)) has constant components in the &quot;U&quot;1 coordinate system. That is, the functions v1(&quot;φ&quot;1−1(&quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;))) are constant. However, applying the product rule to () and using the fact that &quot;d&quot;v1/&quot;dt&quot; = 0 gives

:formula_9

But formula_10 is always a non-singular matrix (provided that the curve &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is not stationary), so v1 and v0 &quot;cannot ever be&quot; simultaneously constant along the curve.

===Resolution===
The problem observed above is that the usual directional derivative of vector calculus does not behave well under changes in the coordinate system when applied to the components of vector fields. This makes it quite difficult to describe how to translate vector fields in a parallel manner, if indeed such a notion makes any sense at all. There are two fundamentally different ways of resolving this problem.

The first approach is to examine what is required for a generalization of the directional derivative to &quot;behave well&quot; under coordinate transitions. This is the tactic taken by the covariant derivative approach to connections: good behavior is equated with covariance. Here one considers a modification of the directional derivative by a certain linear operator, whose components are called the Christoffel symbols, which involves no derivatives on the vector field itself. The directional derivative &quot;D&quot;uv of the components of a vector v in a coordinate system &quot;φ&quot; in the direction u are replaced by a &quot;covariant derivative&quot;:

:formula_11

where Γ depends on the coordinate system &quot;φ&quot; and is bilinear in u and v. In particular, Γ does not involve any derivatives on u or v. In this approach, Γ must transform in a prescribed manner when the coordinate system &quot;φ&quot; is changed to a different coordinate system. This transformation is not tensorial, since it involves not only the &quot;first derivative&quot; of the coordinate transition, but also its &quot;second derivative&quot;. Specifying the transformation law of Γ is not sufficient to determine Γ uniquely. Some other normalization conditions must be imposed, usually depending on the type of geometry under consideration. In Riemannian geometry, the Levi-Civita connection requires compatibility of the Christoffel symbols with the metric (as well as a certain symmetry condition). With these normalizations, the connection is uniquely defined.

The second approach is to use Lie groups to attempt to capture some vestige of symmetry on the space. This is the approach of Cartan connections. The example above using rotations to specify the parallel transport of vectors on the sphere is very much in this vein.

==Historical survey of connections==

Historically, connections were studied from an infinitesimal perspective in Riemannian geometry. The infinitesimal study of connections began to some extent with Elwin Christoffel. This was later taken up more thoroughly by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita {{harv|Levi-Civita|Ricci|1900}} who observed in part that a connection in the infinitesimal sense of Christoffel also allowed for a notion of parallel transport.

The work of Levi-Civita focused exclusively on regarding connections as a kind of differential operator whose parallel displacements were then the solutions of differential equations. As the twentieth century progressed, Élie Cartan developed a new notion of connection. He sought to apply the techniques of Pfaffian systems to the geometries of Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen program. In these investigations, he found that a certain infinitesimal notion of connection (a Cartan connection) could be applied to these geometries and more: his connection concept allowed for the presence of curvature which would otherwise be absent in a classical Klein geometry. (See, for example, {{harv|Cartan|1926}} and {{harv|Cartan|1983}}.) Furthermore, using the dynamics of Gaston Darboux, Cartan was able to generalize the notion of parallel transport for his class of infinitesimal connections. This established another major thread in the theory of connections: that a connection is a certain kind of differential form.

The two threads in connection theory have persisted through the present day: a connection as a differential operator, and a connection as a differential form. In 1950, Jean-Louis Koszul {{harv|Koszul|1950}} gave an algebraic framework for regarding a connection as a differential operator by means of the Koszul connection. The Koszul connection was both more general than that of Levi-Civita, and was easier to work with because it finally was able to eliminate (or at least to hide) the awkward Christoffel symbols from the connection formalism. The attendant parallel displacement operations also had natural algebraic interpretations in terms of the connection. Koszul&#x27;s definition was subsequently adopted by most of the differential geometry community, since it effectively converted the &quot;analytic&quot; correspondence between covariant differentiation and parallel translation to an &quot;algebraic&quot; one.

In that same year, Charles Ehresmann {{harv|Ehresmann|1950}}, a student of Cartan&#x27;s, presented a variation on the connection as a differential form view in the context of principal bundles and, more generally, fibre bundles. Ehresmann connections were, strictly speaking, not a generalization of Cartan connections. Cartan connections were quite rigidly tied to the underlying differential topology of the manifold because of their relationship with Cartan&#x27;s equivalence method. Ehresmann connections were rather a solid framework for viewing the foundational work of other geometers of the time, such as Shiing-Shen Chern, who had already begun moving away from Cartan connections to study what might be called gauge connections. In Ehresmann&#x27;s point of view, a connection in a principal bundle consists of a specification of &quot;horizontal&quot; and &quot;vertical&quot; vector fields on the total space of the bundle. A parallel translation is then a lifting of a curve from the base to a curve in the principal bundle which is horizontal. This viewpoint has proven especially valuable in the study of holonomy.

==Possible approaches==

*A rather direct approach is to specify how a covariant derivative acts on elements of the module of vector fields as a differential operator. More generally, a similar approach applies for connections in any vector bundle.
*Traditional index notation specifies the connection by components; see Christoffel symbols. (&quot;Note&quot;: this has three indices, but is not a tensor).
*In pseudo-Riemannian and Riemannian geometry the Levi-Civita connection is a special connection associated to the metric tensor.
*These are examples of affine connections. There is also a concept of projective connection, of which the Schwarzian derivative in complex analysis is an instance. More generally, both affine and projective connections are types of Cartan connections.
*Using principal bundles, a connection can be realized as a Lie algebra-valued differential form. See connection (principal bundle).
*An approach to connections which makes direct use of the notion of transport of &quot;data&quot; (whatever that may be) is the Ehresmann connection.
*The most abstract approach may be that suggested by Alexander Grothendieck, where a Grothendieck connection is seen as descent data from infinitesimal neighbourhoods of the diagonal; see {{harv|Osserman|2004}}.

<text>Reed Smoot (January 10, 1862February 9, 1941) was an American politician, businessman, and apostle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). A Republican who was first elected to the U.S. Senate by the Utah State Legislature in 1902, he served from 1903 to 1933. Smoot is primarily remembered as the co-sponsor of the 1930 Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, which increased almost 900 American import duties. Criticized at the time as having &quot;intensified nationalism all over the world&quot; by Thomas Lamont of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., Smoot–Hawley is widely regarded as one of the catalysts for the worsening Great Depression.

Smoot was a prominent leader of the LDS Church, called to serve as an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve in 1900. His role in the church (together with rumors of a secret church policy continuing polygamy and a secret oath against the United States) led to a controversy of four years after he was elected to the Senate. A Senate committee investigated his eligibility to serve, known as the Reed Smoot hearings, and recommended against him, but the full Senate voted to seat him. Smoot continued to be reelected to successive terms until he lost his seat in the 1932 elections. Smoot returned to Utah in 1933. Retiring from politics and business, he devoted himself to the church. At the time of his death, he was third in the line of succession to lead the church.

==Early life, family, and religious activity==
Smoot was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory on January 10, 1862, the son of Abraham O. Smoot, who served as mayor of the city from 1856 to 1862 and Anne Kristina Morrison Smoot, also known as Anne Kirstine Mauritzen before her marriage. Anne was Abraham Smoot&#x27;s fifth wife of six plural marriages, and he was the father of 27 children, three of whom he adopted. The family moved to Provo, Utah, when Abraham Smoot was called by Brigham Young as the stake president. Smoot attended the University of Utah and graduated from Brigham Young Academy (now Brigham Young University) in 1879. After completing his education, Smoot served as a missionary for the church in England. After returning to Utah, he married Alpha M. Eldredge of Salt Lake City on September 17, 1884. They were the parents of six children. Thereafter, Smoot became a successful businessman in the Provo and Salt Lake City areas, with interests including dry goods stores, mining, banking, railroads, lumberyards, raising livestock, coal sales, and manufacturing woolens. Beginning in 1895, he became increasingly involved in the hierarchy of the LDS Church. On April 8, 1900, he was ordained an apostle and member of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
==United States Senate==
Smoot joined the Republican Party and took part in several campaigns beginning in the late 1880s. In February 1892, he was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for mayor of Provo. Beginning in 1892, he was a delegate to several Utah County Republican conventions. He began serving as a member of the state Republican executive committee in the mid-1890s.

After becoming an apostle in 1900, Smoot received the approval of LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith to run for office. In 1901, he ran for the U.S. Senate, and was defeated in the state legislative election by Thomas Kearns. Smoot was elected by the Utah legislature to the United States Senate (58th Congress) on January 20, 1903. When he took his oath of office, Kearns provided his formal introduction to the senate.

===Controversy over religious affiliation===
Smoot&#x27;s election sparked a bitter four-year battle in the Senate on whether Smoot was eligible and should be allowed to serve. Many Americans were suspicious of the LDS Church because of its earlier polygamous practices. In addition, some senators thought Smoot&#x27;s position as an apostle would disqualify him from representing all his constituents. Many were convinced that his association with the church disqualified him from serving in the United States Senate. Only a few years earlier, another prominent Utah Latter-day Saint, B. H. Roberts, had been elected to the House of Representatives. He was denied his seat on the basis that he practiced plural marriage (polygamy), which was illegal in Utah as well as all other states of the Union.

The LDS Church had officially renounced future plural marriages in an 1890 Manifesto, before Utah was admitted as a state. However, the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; reported that church leaders continued to approve secretly of new, post-Manifesto plural marriages. Because of the controversy, the Senate began an investigation into Smoot&#x27;s eligibility. The Smoot Hearings began on January 16, 1904. The hearings included exhaustive questioning into the continuation of plural marriage within the state of Utah and the LDS Church, and questions on church teachings, doctrines, and history. Although Smoot was not a polygamist, the charge by those opposed to his election to the Senate was that he could not swear to uphold the United States Constitution while serving in the highest echelons of an organization that sanctioned law breaking.
Some opponents claimed that temple-attending Latter-day Saints took an &quot;oath of vengeance&quot; against the United States for past grievances. As a leader of the LDS Church, Smoot was accused of taking this oath, which he denied. Although the majority of the investigative committee recommended that Smoot be removed from office, on February 20, 1907, the two-thirds majority required to expel Smoot failed and he was allowed to keep his seat.

===Political career===
Smoot was reelected in 1908 and continued to be reelected to successive terms until 1932, serving in the Senate until March 1933. A constitutional amendment mandated the popular election of U.S. senators after 1913. He was defeated in the 1932 election.

In 1916, William Kent was the lead sponsor in the House of Representatives of legislation to establish the National Park Service. Smoot sponsored the similar Senate bill. The legislation passed the House of Representatives on July 1, 1916, passed the Senate on August 5, and was signed by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916. The agency was placed within the cabinet Department of Interior.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine in December 1926 described Charles Curtis and Smoot as the two leading senators, stating that the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee spoke &quot;with a dry holy passion for financial soundness&quot;. Smoot led the committee from 1923 to 1933, and served on the Senate Appropriations Committee. He became active in the national Republican Party and served as a delegate to the Republican national convention every four years between 1908 and 1924. He was Chairman of the 1928 Resolutions Committee at the 1928 Republican National Convention and Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Smoot was a co-sponsor of the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, which raised U.S. import tariffs on over 20,000 dutiable items to record levels. Many historians believe that it exacerbated the Great Depression. U.S. President Herbert Hoover signed the act into law on June 17, 1930.

Smoot served five terms before being defeated in the 1932 election by Democrat Elbert D. Thomas. After his unsuccessful reelection campaign, Smoot moved back to Salt Lake City. He retired from active business and political pursuits to dedicate his remaining years as an apostle for the LDS Church. Smoot died on February 9, 1941, during a visit to St. Petersburg, Florida. He was buried in Provo.

<text>The Canadian social credit movement is a political movement originally based on the Social Credit theory of Major C. H. Douglas. Its supporters were colloquially known as Socreds in English and créditistes in French. It gained popularity and its own political party in the 1930s, as a result of the Great Depression.

==Federal politics==

The Western Social Credit League, an outgrowth of Alberta Social Credit, ran candidates in the 1935 federal election taking many votes from the Progressive Party of Canada and the United Farmers movement. In the 1940 federal election, Socreds ran with supporters of William Duncan Herridge as New Democracy, but reverted to the Social Credit name in subsequent elections with the Social Credit Association of Canada being officially formed in 1944. The party was generally fairly small, and gradually declined. The party won its last federal seats in Alberta in 1965. (SC MP Robert Norman Thompson (Red Deer) went on to be elected as a Conservative in 1968.)

In the 1960s, the Québécois wing of the party split off to form the &quot;Ralliement créditiste&quot;. The two wings reunited in 1971. The party was left without any parliamentary seats following the 1980 federal election, and thereafter declined into irrelevance, though it nominally continued to exist until 1993.

==Alberta==

The ideology was embraced by the Reverend William Aberhart (&quot;Bible Bill&quot;), who formed the Alberta Social Credit League in 1934. He added a heavy dose of fundamentalist Christianity to Douglas&#x27; social credit theory. Social Credit won the 1935 provincial election in a massive landslide, and Aberhart became Premier of Alberta. His government was probably the only one in the world known to have adhered to the social credit ideology. In fact, following the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers&#x27; revolt in which Aberhart&#x27;s government was pressured to implement its fiscal program, he once tried to implement social credit by issuing &quot;prosperity certificates&quot; to Albertans. This measure was disallowed by the Supreme Court of Canada on the basis that only the federal government was authorized to issue currency.

Aberhart died in office in 1943, and was replaced by Ernest Manning. Although Manning had been an early supporter of Social Credit, he largely abandoned the theory while keeping the Social Credit name. He also purged the party of anti-Semites; although antisemitism had long been part of the party&#x27;s populist rhetoric, it fell out of fashion after World War II.

The Alberta Socreds formed nine consecutive majority governments spanning 36 years, the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial level at the time. Largely due to Manning&#x27;s leadership and to Alberta&#x27;s powerful influence within the Canadian Social Credit movement, the Canadian social credit movement developed a strong social conservative tint.

The party lost its last MLAs in 1982 and never elected a member again. Although the party was no longer a significant force in Alberta politics, it had some support and briefly experienced a revival around 2005. However, in 2008, the party collapsed to only 0.2 percent of the vote, its worst showing since its founding in 1934. In 2017 it was renamed to the Pro-Life Alberta Political Association, which has only tenuous connections to its social credit heritage.

==British Columbia==

In the 1930s and 1940s, the social credit movement in British Columbia was largely fractious, and made up of various small groups, the largest of which being the Social Credit League. The British Columbian movement was largely at odds with the Albertan wing and sought to distance itself from William Aberhart&#x27;s religious preaching.

The effective death of the movement came when former Tory W. A. C. Bennett was elected leader of the League in 1951. Bennett joined in order to use the party as a political vehicle. He quickly jettisoned the original ideology, and reorganized the party into the conservative populist British Columbia Social Credit Party.

Social Credit&#x27;s first government in British Columbia was a very small minority, but they were elected to a majority a year later. After the minority, and 20 years of majority government, the party was defeated by the New Democratic Party of British Columbia. The NDP served only one term in Government, before the Social Credit Party was returned to office for four more terms of majority government under W. A. C. Bennett&#x27;s son, Bill Bennett. Bennett was succeeded by Bill Vander Zalm in 1986, but Vander Zalm was forced to resign in 1991 in favour of Rita Johnston.

The Social Credit government was defeated by the NDP in the 1991 election, and was knocked down to third place. The party collapsed in the 1996 election when it failed to win a single seat in the legislature, and received only 0.4% of votes cast. Many of the party&#x27;s mainstream members left to join the British Columbia Liberal Party, which emerged in the early 1990s as the new &quot;free enterprise&quot; coalition opposing the NDP.

The party quickly dwindled into fringe status, and since then has only existed in desultory fashion. It ran only two candidates in the 2001 election. The strongest candidate of the two, Grant Mitton, a former radio talk show host who received 17% of the vote in his riding, later left the party to form the British Columbia Party. The Social Credit party only ran two candidates in 2005, none in 2009, and one in 2013. The party was de-registered shortly afterward. It regained its registration in 2016, but after running only two candidates in the 2017 provincial election and none in 2020, the party lost its registration again in 2023.

==Quebec==
The movement also caught on in Quebec in part because of the work of Louis Even who translated social credit literature into French, wrote his own articles on the subject and published and circulated periodicals to promote social credit theories. He and Gilberte Côté-Mercier founded a lay Christian group called the &quot;Pilgrims of Saint Michael&quot;, based in Rougemont, Quebec, that promotes social credit monetary policy coupled with conservative Catholicism. The Pilgrims publish &quot;The Michael Journal&quot; in English and &quot;Vers Demain&quot; in French. The group is nicknamed &quot;the White Berets&quot; for the headgear worn by members.

Even and Côté-Mercier also founded the &quot;Union des électeurs&quot; in 1939 as a provincial party based on social credit theories and recruited Réal Caouette to the movement. Even and Armand Turpin ran federally as New Democracy candidates in the 1940 federal election, but none was elected. The movement was able to win a post World War II by-election under the &quot;Union des électeurs&quot; label, with Caouette being sent to the House of Commons of Canada. The Union broke with the Social Credit Party of Canada in 1947 over Ernest Manning&#x27;s rejection of more orthodox social credit economic theory and his purge of anti-Semites from the social credit movement. The Union held more orthodox views in line with C.H. Douglas&#x27;s original economic and political philosophy including a rejection of party politics in the belief that it should be replaced by a non-partisan &quot;union of electors&quot; in which elected officials would implement the popular will.

Caouette ran for re-election as a &quot;union des electeurs&quot; candidate and lost his seat in the 1949 federal election. Caouette continued to run in elections unsuccessfully through the 1950s over the objections of Even and Côté-Mercier and split with them on May 4, 1958 to form &quot;Ralliement des créditistes&quot; as the Quebec wing of the Social Credit Party of Canada with himself as leader. It achieved a major breakthrough in the 1962 federal election, and remained in the House of Commons under various names until 1980.

Social Credit was never able to form a provincial government in Quebec due to the near dominance of social conservative votes by the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; party from the 1930s into the 1960s. The Social Credit Party, however, soon became a major contender in Quebec for seats to the federal Parliament in the 1960s. Although BC and Alberta would elect a few Social Credit Members of Parliament (MPs) in that decade, it would be Quebec that maintained the party&#x27;s national presence after 1962. Social Credit remained dominant in the other two provinces in provincial elections.

In the 1962 election, Social Credit won 26 of 75 seats in Quebec, beating the Progressive Conservative Party. They continued to finish in second place in terms of federal seats from Quebec until their last MPs fell with the minority government of Joe Clark in 1980. The most Social Credit ever captured in terms of the Quebec popular vote was 27.3% federally, and 11.2% provincially.

The Quebec wing of the movement broke from the rest of the party in 1963 to form its own Quebec-only federal Social Credit party, the &quot;Ralliement des créditistes&quot;. As a social conservative party, the party generally attracted voters who supported of the Union Nationale in provincial elections.

The party formed a provincial wing in 1970, the &quot;Ralliement créditiste du Québec&quot;, which benefited as the UN declined after the death of Premier Daniel Johnson in 1968.

The growth of Quebec separatism stymied the rise of the provincial Créditistes. Although &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; is a social democratic party, it drew nationalist voters away from the Créditistes.

In the 1970 provincial election, the Liberals took 72 seats, followed by the Union Nationale with 17, and &quot;Ralliement créditiste du Québec&quot; with 12. The party was riven by internal dissent for the remainder of its history, capturing two seats in the 1973 election, and only one in the 1976 election, the last time a &quot;créditiste&quot; was elected to the Quebec National Assembly.

==New Brunswick==

While Social Credit never won any seats in the New Brunswick Legislature, it won 3.1% of the vote in the 1948 provincial election, the party&#x27;s first. Social Credit also ran candidates in 1952 and 1956 winning 0.5% and 1.6% of the vote respectively.

==Manitoba==

In Manitoba, the party was able to win a few seats in the Legislature, and was the third party in each at various times. From 1936 to 1940, the party supported John Bracken&#x27;s minority government, and in 1940 it joined Bracken&#x27;s coalition government.

Of the ten elections from 1936–1973, the party won seats in seven. In the 1936 provincial election, Social Credit finished third, and in the 1941 provincial election, it tied for third. However, Social Credit never won more than 14% of the popular vote.

==Saskatchewan==

In Saskatchewan, Social Credit won seats in the Legislature in two elections – 2 seats in the 1938 election, and 3 in the 1956 election. In 1956, the party held third party status. Social Credit was never able to win more than 16% of the popular vote.

==Ontario==

In Ontario, the party unsuccessfully ran candidates in most provincial elections from 1945 until 1975, never obtaining electoral support beyond a negligible level.

The party faced serious divisions in the 1940s, 1960s and early 1970s due to attempted takeovers by fascist groups and was put in trusteeship by the federal party in 1972 when the fascist Western Guard succeeded in taking control.

The party continued as a registered party into the 1980s, not running candidates in the 1977 election and running only 5 candidates with interim leader John Turmel in the 1981 election. It was defunct by 1985.

==Other parties==

Other political parties have also promoted social credit principles, including John Turmel&#x27;s Christian Credit Party and Abolitionist Party of Canada, and the short-lived Canada Party. The Global Party of Canada also appears to promote social credit economic policies.

The Reform Party of Canada was founded in 1987 originally as a populist political vehicle for Western Canadian alienation with the federal government and national parties. Reform Party founder and leader Preston Manning was the son of former Alberta Social Credit Party leader Ernest Manning. The Reform Party became the largest conservative party in the Canadian House of Commons from 1993 on. In 2000 Reform dissolved to rebrand as the Canadian Alliance. In 2003 the Canadian Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservative Party to form the modern Conservative Party of Canada. This series of parties shared some conservative and populist appeal with the Social Credit parties but never adopted social credit monetary policies.

The Canadian Action Party had monetary reform policies in its platform, but was not considered to be a social credit party.
