<text>Tisha B&#x27;Av ( ; , ) is an annual fast day in Judaism. A commemoration of a number of disasters in Jewish history, primarily the destruction of both Solomon&#x27;s Temple by the Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Second Temple by the Roman Empire in Jerusalem.

Tisha B&#x27;Av precedes the end of the three weeks between dire straits. This day is regarded as the saddest day in the Jewish calendar. It is categorized as a day destined for tragedy. Tisha B&#x27;Av falls in July or August in the Gregorian calendar.

Observances of the day include five prohibitions, most notable of which is a 25-hour fast. The Book of Lamentations, which mourns the destruction of Jerusalem, is read in synagogue, followed by the recitation of &quot;kinnot&quot;, liturgical dirges that lament the loss of the Temples and Jerusalem. As the day has become associated with remembrance of other major calamities which have befallen the Jewish people, some &quot;kinnot&quot; also recall events such as the murder of the Ten Martyrs by the Romans; expulsions from England, Spain, and elsewhere; massacres of numerous medieval Jewish communities by Crusaders; the Holocaust; and the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.

==History==

===Five calamities===

According to the Mishnah (&quot;Taanit&quot; 4:6), five specific events occurred on the ninth of Av that warrant fasting:

# The Twelve Spies sent by Moses to observe the land of Canaan returned from their mission. Only two of the spies, Joshua and Caleb, brought a positive report, while the others spoke disparagingly about the land. The majority report caused the Children of Israel to cry, panic and despair of ever entering the &quot;Promised Land&quot;. For this, they were punished by God that their generation would not enter the land. The midrash quotes God as saying about this event, &quot;You cried before me pointlessly, I will fix for you [this day as a day of] crying for the generations&quot;, alluding to the future misfortunes which occurred on the same date.
# The First Temple built by King Solomon was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BCE, and the population of the Kingdom of Judah was sent into the Babylonian exile. According to the Bible, the First Temple&#x27;s destruction began on the 7th of Av (2 Kings 25:8) and continued until the 10th (Jeremiah 52:12). According to the Talmud, the actual destruction of the Temple began on the Ninth of Av, and it continued to burn throughout the Tenth of Av.
# The Second Temple, built by Zerubbabel and renovated by Herod the Great, was destroyed by the Romans on 9 Av 70 CE, scattering the people of Judea and commencing the Jewish exile from the Holy Land. 
# The Romans subsequently crushed Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt and destroyed the city of Betar, killing over 500,000 Jewish civilians (approximately 580,000) on 9 Av 135 CE.
# Following the Bar Kokhba revolt, Roman commander Quintus Tineius Rufus plowed the site of the Temple in Jerusalem and the surrounding area.

===Other calamities===
Over time, Tisha B&#x27;Av has come to be a Jewish day of mourning, not only for these events, but also for later tragedies that occurred on or near the 9th of Av. References to some of these events appear in liturgy composed for Tisha B&#x27;Av (see below). Note that dates prior to 1582 are in the Julian calendar, not the Gregorian calendar.

*The First Crusade officially commenced on 15 August 1096 (Av 24, AM 4856), killing 10,000 Jews in its first month and destroying Jewish communities in France and the Rhineland.
*The Jews were expelled from England on 18 July 1290 (Av 9, AM 5050).
*The Jews were expelled from France on 22 July 1306 (Av 10, AM 5066).
*The Jews were expelled from Spain on 31 July 1492 (Av 7, AM 5252).
*Germany entered World War I on 1–2 August 1914 (Av 9–10, AM 5674), which caused massive upheaval in European Jewry and whose aftermath led to World War II and the Holocaust.
* On 2 August 1941 (Av 9, AM 5701), SS commander Heinrich Himmler formally received approval from the Nazi Party for &quot;The Final Solution,&quot; which marked the beginning of the Holocaust during which almost one third of the world&#x27;s Jewish population was murdered.
*On 23 July 1942 (Av 9, AM 5702), the mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka began.
*The AMIA bombing on the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, killed 85 and injured 300 on 18 July 1994 (10 Av, AM 5754).
*The 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, according to some Religious Zionist rabbis like Yaakov Ariel and Dov Lior. Kinnot have been composed about the withdrawal, and the connection to Tisha b&#x27;Av was emphasized in 10-year anniversary commemorations. The disengagement&#x27;s timing lent itself to symbolic interpretation both by Religious Zionists and by wider Jewish culture. However, even within Religious Zionism, Chaim Navon holds that the disengagement did not rise to the level of a calamity and Shlomo Aviner has written that mourning the disengagement on Tisha b&#x27;Av is forbidden because it incites political division. Yona Metzger, then Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi of Israel, ruled in 2006 that the disengagement was a tragedy but mourning rituals should not be integrated into Tisha b&#x27;Av, while Howard Jachter permits it in narrow fashion.

While the Holocaust spanned a number of years, religious communities use Tisha B&#x27;Av to mourn its 6,000,000 Jewish victims, either in addition to or instead of the secular Holocaust Memorial Days such as Yom HaShoah. On Tisha B&#x27;Av, communities that otherwise do not modify the traditional prayer liturgy have added the recitation of special &quot;kinnot&quot; related to the Holocaust.

Similarly, kinnot have been added to the tisha b&#x27;av liturgy regarding the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.

===Related observances===
In connection with the fall of Jerusalem, three other fast-days were established at the same time as the Ninth Day of Av: these were the Tenth of Tevet, when the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians began; the Seventeenth of Tammuz, when the first breach was made in the wall by the Romans; and the Third of Tishrei, known as the Fast of Gedaliah, the day when Gedaliah was assassinated in the time of the Babylonians following the destruction of the First Temple. The three weeks leading up to Tisha B&#x27;Av are known as The Three Weeks, while the nine days leading up to Tisha B&#x27;Av are known as The Nine Days.

==Laws and customs==

Tisha B&#x27;Av falls in July or August in the Gregorian calendar. When Tisha B&#x27;Av falls on Shabbat (the Sabbath), it then is (&quot;delayed&quot; in Hebrew). Thus the observance of Tisha B&#x27;Av can take place on the following day (that is, Sunday). This last occurred in 2022, and will next occur in 2029. No mourning can intrude upon the Sabbath. Normally Sabbath eating and drinking ends just before sunset Saturday evening, rather than nightfall.

This fast lasts just over 25 hours, beginning at sunset on the preceding evening, lasting until nightfall the next day. Pleasurable activities are forbidden.

===Main prohibitions===
&quot;Tisha B&#x27;Av&quot; bears a stringent nature alike that of Yom Kippur. The length of a fast that lasts over 25 hours, beginning before sunset on the eve of Tisha B&#x27;Av and ends at nightfall the following day, Tisha B&#x27;Av mandates the following five prohibitions:

#No eating or drinking;
#No washing or bathing;
#No application of creams or oils;
#No wearing of (leather) shoes;
#No marital (sexual) relations.

These restrictions are waived in the case of health issues. A competent posek, a rabbi who decides Jewish Law, must be consulted. Those who are ill will be allowed to eat and drink. On other fast days, almost any medical condition can justify breaking the fast; in practice, consultation with a rabbi is best. Ritual hand washing up to the knuckles is permitted. Washing to cleanse dirt or mud from one&#x27;s body is also permitted.

===Additional customs===

Torah study is forbidden on Tisha B&#x27;Av (as it is considered an enjoyable activity), except for the study of distressing texts such as the Book of Lamentations, the Book of Job, portions of Jeremiah and chapters of the Talmud that discuss the laws of mourning and those that discuss the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.

In synagogue, prior to the commencement of the evening services, the parochet, which normally covers and adorns the Torah ark, is removed or drawn aside until the Mincha prayer service. Spanish and Portuguese Jews, who do not hang a curtain in front of the ark during the rest of the year, place a black curtain over the ark for tisha b&#x27;av.

According to Moses Isserles, it is customary to sit on low stools or on the floor, as is done during shiva (the first week of mourning), from the meal immediately before the fast (the seudah hamafseket) until midday (chatzot hayom) of the fast itself. It is customary to eat a hard-boiled egg dipped in ashes and a piece of bread dipped into ashes during this pre-fast meal. The &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; rules that the custom to sit low to the ground extends past mid-day until one prays Mincha (the afternoon prayer).

The custom is to dim the lighting and to read the kinnot by candlelight. Some sleep on the floor or modify their normal sleeping routine, for instance, by sleeping without a pillow (or with one fewer pillow than usual). People refrain from greeting each other or sending gifts on this day. Old siddurim and Torah scrolls are often buried on this day.

The custom is to not put on tefillin nor tallit for Shacharit services. Men wear only the tallit katan without a blessing. At mincha services, tzitzit and tefilin are worn, with proper blessings before donning them.

===End of fast===
Although the fast ends at nightfall, according to tradition the First Temple continued burning throughout the night and for most of the following day, the tenth of Av. It is therefore customary to maintain all restrictions of the nine days through midday (&quot;chatzos&quot;) of the following day.

When Tisha B&#x27;Av falls on a Saturday, and is therefore observed on Sunday, the 10th of Av, it is not necessary to wait until midday Monday to end restrictions of the nine days. However, one refrains from involvement in activity that would be considered &quot;joyous&quot;, such as eating meat, drinking wine, listening to music, and saying the &quot;shehecheyonu&quot; blessing, until Monday morning. One can wash laundry and shave immediately after the end of a delayed Tisha B&#x27;Av.

When Tisha B&#x27;Av begins on Saturday night, the Havdalah ritual is postponed by 24 hours, as one could not drink the accompanying wine. One says &quot;Attah Chonantanu&quot; in the Saturday night &quot;Shemoneh Esrei&quot; prayer or says &quot;Baruch Hamavdil&quot; thus ending Shabbat. A blessing &quot;is&quot; made on the candle Saturday night. After Tisha B&#x27;Av ends on Sunday evening, the Havdalah ceremony is performed with wine (without candle or spices).

The laws of Tisha B&#x27;Av are recorded in the Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 552–557.

==Prayer service==
===Scriptural readings===
The Book of Lamentations is read in synagogue during the evening services.

In many Sephardic congregations, the Book of Job is read on the morning of Tisha B&#x27;Av.

Those called to the Torah reading on Tisha B&#x27;Av are not given the usual congratulations for this honor. There is also a tradition that those who were called to read from the Torah or Haftara in the Tisha B&#x27;Av morning service are also called to read in the afternoon service, because the morning readings are filled with calamity and the afternoon readings contain words of consolation.

===Kinnot===

Most of the morning is spent chanting or reading Kinnot, bewailing the loss of the Temples and subsequent persecutions, many others referring to post-exile disasters. Later &quot;kinnot&quot; were composed by various poets (often prominent rabbis) who had suffered in the events mentioned. Important &quot;kinnot&quot; were composed by Elazar ha-Kalir and Rabbi Judah ha-Levi. After the Holocaust, &quot;kinnot&quot; were composed by the German-born Rabbi Shimon Schwab (in 1959, at the request of Rabbi Joseph Breuer) and by Rabbi Solomon Halberstam, leader of the Bobov Hasidim (in 1984). Since Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement from Gaza, some segments of the Religious Zionist community have begun to recite &quot;kinnot&quot; to commemorate the expulsion of Jewish settlers from Gush Katif and the northern West Bank on the day after Tisha B&#x27;Av, in 2005.

===Nachem===
A paragraph that begins &quot;Nahem&quot; (&quot;Console...&quot;) is added to the conclusion of the blessing &quot;Boneh Yerushalayim&quot; (&quot;Who builds Jerusalem&quot;) recited during the Amidah (for Ashkenazim, only at the Mincha service). The prayer elaborates the mournful state of the Temple and city of Jerusalem. The concluding signature of the blessing is also extended to say &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, Who consoles Zion and builds Jerusalem.&quot;

Various Modern Orthodox and Conservative rabbis have proposed amending &quot;Nachem&quot;, as its wording no longer reflects the existence of a rebuilt Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty. Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren, for example, issued a revised wording of the prayer and Rabbi Hayim David HaLevi proposed putting the prayer&#x27;s verbs relating to the Temple&#x27;s destruction into the past tense. However, such proposals have not been widely adopted.

==History of the observance==
In the long period which is reflected in Talmudic literature the observance of Tisha B&#x27;Av assumed a character of constantly growing sadness and asceticism. 

Two independent accounts in non-Jewish sources, written in the 4th and 5th centuries of the Common Era (CE), describe how Jews made pilgrimage to Jerusalem each year to mourn for their ruined Temple. At the time, the Byzantine Empire—which had recently adopted Christianity as the state religion—controlled Jerusalem and forbade Jews from entering the city. The only exception, evidently, was on a day of mourning, presumably the annual commemoration of Tisha B&#x27;Av. 

The first account is by the anonymous Bordeaux Pilgrim in his Latin travelogue, the Itinerarium Burdigalense, which is dated to 333 CE. The Bordeaux Pilgrim described a &quot;perforated stone&quot; on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which the Jews &quot;anoint&quot;—i.e., rub with oil—once a year. While the Bordeaux Pilgrim stood in front of the stone, he heard the Jews lamenting and saw them tearing their clothes. 

The second account is by the Christian Saint Jerome, who spent time in Jerusalem after moving from Rome to Bethlehem in the late 4th Century CE. Jerome was a prolific writer. In the early 5th Century, he wrote commentaries on the Twelve Minor Prophets, including Zephaniah. In his commentary on Zephaniah 1.16, Jerome described the mourning practices of Jews on the Temple Mount, including how the Jews had to bribe Roman soldiers for permission to lament there. He also described Roman soldiers demanding additional money from elderly Jews, who were weeping, had disheveled hair, and wore garments that looked both worn out and torn.

Over the centuries, the observance of the day had lost much of its gloom.

The growing strictness in the observance of mourning customs in connection with Tisha B&#x27;Av became pronounced in post-Talmudic times, and particularly in one of the darkest periods of Jewish history, from the 15th century to the 18th.

Maimonides (12th century) says that the restrictions as to the eating of meat and the drinking of wine refer only to the last meal before fasting on the Eighth Day of Av, if taken after noon, but before noon anything may be eaten. Rabbi Moses of Coucy (13th century) (aka the Smag) wrote that it is the universal custom to refrain from meat and wine during the whole day preceding the Ninth of Av. Rabbi Joseph Caro (16th century) says some are accustomed to abstain from meat and wine from the beginning of the week in which the Ninth Day of Av falls; and still others abstain throughout the three weeks from the Seventeenth of Tammuz.

A gradual extension of prohibitions can be traced in the abstention from marrying at this season and in other signs of mourning. So Rabbi Moses of Coucy says that some do not use the tefillin (&quot;phylacteries&quot;) in the morning of the Ninth Day of Av, a custom which later was universally observed (it is now postponed until the afternoon). In this manner many customs originally designated as marks of unusual piety finally became the rule for mostly all Jews.

==Contemporary observance==
===In Israel===
A 2010 poll in Israel revealed that some 22% of Israeli Jews fast on Tisha B&#x27;Av, and 52% said they forego recreational activity on this day even though they do not fast. Another 18% of Israeli Jews responded that were recreational spots permissible to be open they would go out on the eve of the fast day, and labeled the current legal status &quot;religious coercion&quot;. The last 8% declined to answer.

In Israel, restaurants and places of entertainment are closed on the eve of Tisha B&#x27;Av and the following day by law. Establishments that break the law are subject to fines. Outside of Israel, the day is not observed by most secular Jews, as opposed to Yom Kippur, on which many secular Jews fast and go to synagogue. According to halakha, combat soldiers are absolved of fasting on Tisha B&#x27;Av on the basis that it can endanger their lives. the latest example of such a ruling was issued during Operation Protective Edge by Israel&#x27;s Chief Rabbis: Rabbis David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef.

When Menachem Begin became Prime Minister, he wanted to unite all the memorial days and days of mourning on Tisha B&#x27;Av, so that Holocaust Remembrance Day and Memorial Day would also fall on this day, but it was not accepted.

===In relation to the creation of the State of Israel===

Following the Six-Day War, the national religious community viewed Israel&#x27;s territorial conquests with almost messianic overtones. The conquest of geographical areas with immense religious significance, including Jerusalem, the Western Wall, and the Temple Mount, was seen as portentous; however, only the full rebuilding of the Temple would engender enough reason to cease observing the day as one of mourning and transform it into a day of joy instead.

===Progressive Judaism===
Because the destruction of the ancient temples is not assigned a central religious role within progressive denominations of Judaism, observing Tisha B&#x27;Av lacks meaning to progressive Jews.

Some Reform Jews observe Tisha B&#x27;Av, however, many do not. Reform Rabbi Stephen Lewis Fuchs asserted, Tisha B&#x27;Av can be &quot;both a day of mourning and a day of joy&quot; for Reform Jews as the day can mark both mourning Jewish suffering and celebrating Jewish resilience. While the classical Reform position has discouraged observance of Tisha B&#x27;Av, and while many Reform temples still do not observe it, some neo-traditional Reform synagogues have begun to observe Tisha B&#x27;Av. Reform Lawrence A. Hoffman has described the contemporary Reform stance on Tisha B&#x27;Av as &quot;ambivalent and complicated&quot;. Some Reform Jews who observe Tisha B&#x27;Av frame their observance through the lens of social justice or progressive Zionism.

Some Reconstructionist Jews observe Tisha B&#x27;Av and the &quot;Reconstructing Judaism&quot; website offers resources for Reconstructionist Jews who wish to observe it.

The creation of the State of Israel had an important role in shaping the Conservative approach to Tisha B&#x27;Av. Historically, Tisha B&#x27;Av was rarely discussed or observed in the Conservative movement until the 1940s when Camp Ramah was founded by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. The Zionist stance of Camp Ramah emphasized the importance of observing Tisha B&#x27;Av. Some Conservative Jews feel ambivalent towards Tisha B&#x27;Av or have abandoned it because the contemporary city of Jerusalem is thriving and is not in ruins. However, the large majority of Conservative synagogues maintain observance of Tisha B&#x27;Av.

==Other traditions==

Iranian Jews refer to this holiday as Noi (pronounced No-ee), which likely comes from the Persian word “noh” meaning nine. The eve of Tisha B’Av is similarly referred to as Shab-e Noi, meaning night of the ninth.

<text>St Pancras railway station (), officially known since 2007 as London St Pancras International, is a major central London railway terminus on Euston Road in the London Borough of Camden. It is the terminus for Eurostar services from Belgium, France and the Netherlands to London. It provides East Midlands Railway services to , , , and on the Midland Main Line, Southeastern high-speed trains to Kent via and , and Thameslink cross-London services to Bedford, Cambridge, Peterborough, Brighton, Horsham and Gatwick Airport. It stands between the British Library, the Regent&#x27;s Canal and London King&#x27;s Cross railway station, with which it shares a London Underground station, .

The station was constructed by the Midland Railway (MR), to connect its extensive rail network, across the Midlands and North of England, to a dedicated line into London. After rail traffic problems following the 1862 International Exhibition, the MR decided to build a connection from Bedford to London with its own terminus. The station was designed by William Henry Barlow, with wrought iron pillars supporting a single-span roof. At 689 feet (210 m) by 240 feet (73.2 m) wide, and 100 feet (30.5 m) high, it was then the largest enclosed space in the world. Following the station&#x27;s opening 1 October 1868, the MR built the Midland Grand Hotel on the station&#x27;s façade. George Gilbert Scott won the competition to design it, with an ornate Gothic red-brick scheme. St Pancras has been widely praised for its architecture and is now a Grade I listed building.

St Pancras came under threat during the 20th century; damaged in both World War I and World War II by bombs, and then in the late 1960s by plans to demolish it entirely and divert services to King&#x27;s Cross and . A passionate campaign to save the station, led by the Victorian Society, Jane Hughes Fawcett, and Poet Laureate John Betjeman, was successful, and St Pancras was awarded Grade I listed status just 10 days before demolition was due to commence.

At the start of the 21st century, the complex underwent an £800 million refurbishment to become the terminal for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link/High-Speed 1/HS1 as part of an urban regeneration plan across East London, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2007. A security-sealed terminal area was constructed for Eurostar services to mainland Europe via High Speed 1 and the Channel Tunnel, with platforms for domestic trains to the north and south-east of England. The restored station has 15 platforms, a shopping centre, and a coach facility. London St Pancras International is owned by HS1 Ltd and managed by Network Rail (High Speed), a subsidiary of Network Rail.

==Location==
St Pancras is at the southern end of the London Borough of Camden on a site orientated north–south, deeper than it is wide. The south is bounded by Euston Road (part of the London Inner Ring Road), and its frontage is the St Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, while the west is bounded by Midland Road, which separates it from the British Library and Francis Crick Institute, and the east by Pancras Road, which separates it from King&#x27;s Cross station. The British Library is on the former goods yard site. Euston railway station is around ten minutes&#x27; walk away along Euston Road.

Behind the hotel, the train shed is elevated 5 m (17 ft) above street level and the area below forms the station undercroft which is where most of the shops and restaurants are located, along with the Eurostar departure lounge. The northern half of the station is mainly bounded to the east by Camley Street, with Camley Street Natural Park across the road. To the north-east is King&#x27;s Cross Central, formerly known as the Railway Lands, a complex of intersecting railway lines crossed by several roads and the Regent&#x27;s Canal.

Several London bus routes have stops nearby, including 73, 205 and 390.

==Domestic station==
===Background===

The station&#x27;s name comes from the St. Pancras parish, whose name originates from the fourth-century Christian boy martyr Pancras of Rome. The station was commissioned by the Midland Railway (MR), who had a network of routes in the Midlands and in south and west Yorkshire and Lancashire, but no route of its own to London. Before 1857 the MR used the lines of the L&amp;NWR for trains into the capital; subsequently, the company&#x27;s Leicester and Hitchin Railway gave access to London via the Great Northern Railway (GNR).

In 1862, traffic for the second International Exhibition suffered extensive delays over the stretch of line into London over the GNR&#x27;s track; the route into the city via the L&amp;NWR was also at capacity, with coal trains causing the network at and elsewhere to reach effective gridlock. This was the stimulus for the MR to build its own line to London from Bedford, which would be just under long. Samuel Carter was solicitor for the parliamentary bill, which was sanctioned in 1863.

The main economic justification for the MR extension was for the transport of coal and other goods to the capital, which was hindered by a 1s 9d toll on GNR lines. A large goods station was constructed between 1862 and 1865, sited to the west of the King&#x27;s Cross coal depot between the North London Railway and the Regent&#x27;s Canal. Although coal and goods were the main motivation for the London extension, the Midland realised the prestige of having a central London passenger terminus and decided it must have a front on Euston Road. The company purchased the eastern section of land on the road&#x27;s north side owned by Earl Somers.

===Construction===

The passenger station was designed by William Henry Barlow and constructed on a site that had previously been a slum called Agar Town.
The approach line to the station crossed the Regent&#x27;s Canal at a height allowing the line reasonable gradients; this resulted in the level of the line at St Pancras being above the ground level. (By contrast, the lines to the adjacent King&#x27;s Cross station tunnel under the Regent&#x27;s Canal.) Initial plans were for a two or three span roof with the void between station and ground level filled with spoil from tunnelling to join the Midland Main Line to the St. Pancras branch. Instead, due to the value of the land in such a location the lower area was used for freight, in particular beer from Burton. As a result, the undercroft was built with columns and girders, maximising space, set out to the same plans as those used for beer warehouses, and with a basic unit of length that of a beer barrel.

The contract to build the station substructure and connecting lines was given to Messrs. Waring, with Barlow&#x27;s assistant Campion as supervisor. The lower floor for beer warehousing contained interior columns wide and deep, carrying girders supporting the main station and track. The connection to the Widened Lines (St. Pancras branch) ran below the station&#x27;s bottom level, in an east-to-west direction.

To avoid the foundations of the roof interfering with the space beneath, and to simplify the design, and minimise cost, it was decided to construct a single span roof, with cross ties for the arch at the station level. The arch was sprung directly from the station level, with no piers. Additional advice on the design of the roof was given to Barlow by Rowland Mason Ordish. The arches&#x27; ribs had a web depth of , mostly open ironwork. The span width, from wall to wall was , with a rib every . The arch was a slightly pointed design, with a reduced radius of curvature at the springing points. The Butterley Company was contracted to construct the arches. The total cost of the 24 rib roof and glazing was over £53,000, of which over half was for the main ribs. The cost of the gable end was a further £8,500.

The single-span overall roof was the largest such structure in the world at the time of its completion. The materials used were wrought iron framework of lattice design, with glass covering the middle half and timber (inside)/slate (outside) covering the outer quarters. The two end screens were glazed in a vertical rectangular grid pattern with decorative timber cladding around the edge and wrought iron finials around the outer edge. It was long, wide, and high at the apex above the tracks.

Local services began running to the Metropolitan Railway junction underneath the terminus on 13 July 1868. The station itself opened to the public on 1 October. The first service was an overnight mail train from Leeds.

===Early services===

St Pancras was built during a period of expansion for the MR, as the major routes to Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Carlisle opened during this time. By 1902, there were 150 trains arriving and leaving the station daily, though this was far less than at Waterloo or Liverpool Street. As well as Midland services, the Great Eastern Railway (GER) used St Pancras as a &quot;West End&quot; terminus for trains to , , between 1870 and 1917. At the turn of the 20th century, St Pancras had a faster service to than from King&#x27;s Cross, at 71 minutes. GER services were suspended because of World War I and never resumed.

The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) began boat train services from St Pancras from 9 July 1894, following the opening of the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway. The trains ran from St Pancras to Tilbury via and . Tilbury Docks then provided a connection to Australia and Scandinavia. The following year, the LTSR began a service from St Pancras to . Boat trains continued to run from St Pancras until 1963, after which they were moved to Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street.

===Grouping, nationalisation and privatisation===

The Railways Act 1921 forced the merger of the Midland with the London and North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR) into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the LMS adopted the LNWR&#x27;s (the &quot;Premier Line&quot;) Euston station as its principal London terminus. The Midland Grand Hotel was closed in 1935, and the building was subsequently used as offices for British Railways. During World War II, bombing inflicted damage on the train shed, which was only partially reglazed after the war. On the night of 10–11 May 1941 a bomb fell onto the station floor at platform 3, exploding in the beer vaults underneath. The station was not significantly damaged, but was closed for eight days, with platforms 2–3 remaining closed until June. In 1947 the St. Pancras junction was relaid with prefabricated trackwork, along with associated changes to the signalling system.

On the creation of British Railways (BR) in 1948, St Pancras received a significant investment after neglect by the LMS. Destinations included the London area services to North Woolwich, St Albans and Bedford. Long-distance trains reached Glasgow, Leeds, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester, with famous named trains including &quot;The Palatine&quot; to Manchester, &quot;The Thames-Clyde Express&quot; to Glasgow, and &quot;The Master Cutler&quot; to Sheffield (transferred from King&#x27;s Cross in 1966, which itself had transferred from eight years earlier).

On 7 October 1957, the signalling at St Pancras was upgraded, replacing the three original boxes with a power box controlling 205 route switches and 33 points over a network of 1,400 relays. From 1960 to 1966, electrification work on the West Coast Main Line between London and Manchester saw a new Midland Pullman from Manchester to St Pancras. These trains and those to Glasgow were withdrawn following the completion of the rebuilding of Euston and the consolidation of these services.
By the 1960s, St Pancras was seen as redundant, and several attempts were made to close it and demolish the hotel (by then known as St Pancras Chambers). These attempts provoked strong and successful opposition, with the campaign led by the later Poet Laureate, John Betjeman. Jane Hughes Fawcett with the Victorian Society was instrumental in its preservation, and was dubbed &quot;the furious Mrs. Fawcett&quot; by British rail officials. Many of the demonstrators had witnessed the demolition of the nearby Euston Arch a few years previously and were strongly opposed to the distinctive architecture of St Pancras suffering the same fate. The station became Grade I listed building in November 1967, preventing any drastic modifications. The plans were scrapped by BR in December 1968, realising that it was more cost-effective to modernise the hotel instead, though they disliked owning it.
In the 1970s, the train shed roof was in danger of collapse, and the newly appointed Director of Environment Bernard Kaukas persuaded the company to invest £3m to save it.

In 1978, British Rail attempted to raise funds with the sale of the impressive 18 foot diameter station clock, allegedly to a wealthy American collector for £250,000. Custom made for St Pancras station by the world renown Dent the unique time-piece was financially valuable, but during removal it was somehow dropped, shattering on the floor below. Now worth far less money, it was sold to Roland Hoggard, a train-guard nearing retirement, for £25. It took over a week for Hoggard to transport the giant broken clock, a few parts at a time, to his Nottinghamshire home, where he diligently pieced it all back together, to hang on the wall of his barn where it still kept good time. Decades later during the stations renewal as &#x27;St Pancras International&#x27;, Dent of London were able to create an exact replica of the clock by using the original as a template. Hoggard was invited to the 2007 grand re-opening of St Pancras, and able to see the impressive new clock installed exactly where the original had been.

Also in 1978, a &quot;Private Eye&quot; piece claimed that British Rail really wanted to demolish St Pancras but were opposed by &quot;a lot of long-haired sentimentalists&quot; and &quot;faceless bureaucrats&quot; and praised the office blocks that replaced the Euston Arch. The station offices in the listed former Midland Grand Hotel building were subsequently refurbished in 1993, including a new roof with 275 tonnes of Westmorland Green slate.

After the sectorisation of British Rail in 1986, main-line services to the East Midlands were provided by the InterCity sector, with suburban services to St Albans, Luton and Bedford by Network SouthEast. In 1988 the Snow Hill tunnel re-opened resulting in the creation of the Thameslink route and the resultant diversion of the majority of suburban trains to the new route. The station continued to be served by trains running on the Midland mainline to Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield, together with a few suburban services to Bedford and Luton. These constituted only a few trains an hour and left the station underused.

Following the privatisation of British Rail, the long-distance services from St Pancras were franchised to Midland Mainline, a train operating company owned by National Express, starting on 28 April 1996. The few remaining suburban trains still operating into St Pancras were operated by the Thameslink train operating company, owned by Govia, from 2 March 1997.

A small number of trains to and from Leeds were introduced, mainly because the High-Speed Train sets were maintained there and were already running empty north of Sheffield. During the 2000s major rebuild of the West Coast Main Line, St Pancras again temporarily hosted direct and regular inter-city trains to Manchester, this time via the Hope Valley route (via the Dore South curve) under the title of &quot;Project Rio&quot;.

==International station==
===Design===

The original plan for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) involved a tunnel from south-east of London to an underground terminus in the vicinity of King&#x27;s Cross. However, a late change of plan, principally driven by the then Secretary of State for the Environment Michael Heseltine&#x27;s desire for urban regeneration in east London, led to a change of route, with the new line approaching London from the east. This opened the possibility of reusing St Pancras as the terminus, with access via the North London Line, which crosses the throat of the station.

The idea of using the North London line was rejected in 1994 by the transport secretary, John MacGregor, as &quot;difficult to construct and environmentally damaging&quot;. However, the idea of using St Pancras station as the terminus was retained, albeit now linked by of new tunnels to Dagenham via Stratford.

London and Continental Railways (LCR), created at the time of British Rail privatisation, was selected by the government in 1996 to reconstruct St Pancras, build the CTRL, and take over the British share of the Eurostar operation. LCR had owned St Pancras station since privatisation to allow the station to be redeveloped. Financial difficulties in 1998, and the collapse of Railtrack in 2001, caused some revision of this plan, but LCR retained ownership of the station.

The design and project management of reconstruction was undertaken on behalf of LCR by Rail Link Engineering (RLE), a consortium of Bechtel, Arup, Systra and Halcrow. The original reference design for the station was by Nick Derbyshire, former head of British Rail&#x27;s in-house architecture team. The master plan of the complex was by Foster and Partners, and the lead architect of the reconstruction was Alistair Lansley, a former colleague of Nick Derbyshire recruited by RLE.

To accommodate 300-metre+ Eurostar trains, and to provide capacity for the existing trains to the Midlands and the new Kent services on the high-speed rail link, the train shed was extended a considerable distance northwards by a new flat-roofed shed. The station was initially planned to have 13 platforms under this extended train shed. East Midlands services would use the western platforms, Eurostar services the middle platforms, and Kent services the eastern platforms. The Eurostar platforms and one of the Midland platforms would extend back into the Barlow train shed. Access to Eurostar for departing passengers would be via a departure suite on the west of the station, and then to the platforms by a bridge above the tracks within the historic train shed. Arriving Eurostar passengers would leave the station by a new concourse at its north end.

This original design was later modified, with access to the Eurostar platforms from below, using the station undercroft and allowing the deletion of the visually intrusive bridge. By dropping the extension of any of the Midland platforms into the train shed, space was freed up to allow wells to be constructed in the station floor, which provided daylight and access to the undercroft.

The reconstruction of the station was recorded in the BBC Television documentary series &quot;The Eight Hundred Million Pound Railway Station&quot; broadcast as six 30-minute episodes between 13‒28 November 2007.

===Rebuilding===

By early 2004, the eastern side of the extended train shed was complete, and the Barlow train shed was closed to trains. From 12 April 2004, Midland Mainline trains terminated at an interim station occupying the eastern part of the extension immediately adjacent to the entrance.

As part of the construction of the western side of the new train shed that now began, an underground &quot;box&quot; was constructed to house new platforms for Thameslink, which at this point ran partially under the extended station. In order for this to happen, the existing Thameslink tunnels between Kentish Town and King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink were closed between 11 September 2004 and 15 May 2005 while the works were carried out. Thameslink services from the north terminated in the same platforms as the Midland Main Line trains, while services from the south terminated at King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink.

When the lines were re-opened, the new station box was still only a bare concrete shell and could not take passengers. Thameslink trains reverted to their previous route but ran through the station box without stopping. The budget for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link works did not include work on the fitting out of the station, as these works had originally been part of the separate Thameslink 2000 works programme. Despite lobbying by rail operators who wished to see the station open at the same time as St Pancras International, the Government failed to provide additional funding to allow the fit-out works to be completed immediately following the line blockade. Eventually, on 8 February 2006, Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for Transport, announced £50 million funding for the fit-out of the station, plus another £10–15 million for the installation of associated signalling and other lineside works.
The fit-out works were designed by Chapman Taylor and Arup (Eurostar) and completed by ISG Interior Plc Contractors collaborating with Bechtel as Project Managers. The client was London and Continental Railways who were advised by Hitachi Consulting.

In 2005, planning consent was granted for a refurbishment of the former Midland Grand Hotel building, with plans to refurbish and extend it as a hotel and apartment block. The newly refurbished hotel opened to guests on 21 March 2011 with a grand opening ceremony on 5 May.

By the middle of 2006, the western side of the train shed extension was completed. The rebuilding cost was in the region of £800 million, up from an initial estimate of £310 million.

===Opening===

In early November 2007, Eurostar conducted a testing programme in which some 6000 members of the public were involved in passenger check-in, immigration control and departure trials, during which the &quot;passengers&quot; each made three return journeys out of St Pancras to the entrance to the London tunnel. On 4 September 2007, the first test train ran from Paris Gare du Nord to St Pancras. Children&#x27;s illustrator Quentin Blake was commissioned to provide a huge mural of an &quot;imaginary welcoming committee&quot; as a disguise for one of the remaining ramshackle Stanley Building South immediately opposite the station exit.

St Pancras was officially re-opened as St Pancras International, and the High Speed 1 service was launched on 6 November 2007 by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Services were extended to Rotterdam and Amsterdam in April 2018.

During an elaborate opening ceremony, actor Timothy West, as Henry Barlow, addressed the audience, which was also entertained by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the singers Lemar and Katherine Jenkins. In a carefully staged set piece, the first Class 395 train and two Class 373 trains arrived through a cloud of dry ice in adjacent platforms within seconds of each other. During the ceremony, Paul Day&#x27;s large bronze statue &quot;The Meeting Place&quot; was also unveiled. At a much smaller ceremony on 12 November 2007, the bronze statue of John Betjeman by sculptor Martin Jennings was unveiled by Betjeman&#x27;s daughter, the author Candida Lycett Green. Public service by Eurostar train via High Speed 1 started on 14 November 2007. In a small ceremony, station staff cut a ribbon leading to the Eurostar platforms. In the same month, services to the East Midlands were transferred to a new franchisee, East Midlands Trains. The low-level Thameslink platforms opened on 9 December 2007, replacing King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink.

St Pancras has retained a reputation of having one of the most recognisable facades of all the London termini, and known as the &quot;cathedral of the railways&quot;. In &quot;Britain&#x27;s 100 Best Railway Stations&quot; by Simon Jenkins, the station was one of only ten to be awarded five stars. The station has bilingual signs in French and English, one of the few in England to do so. It was considered Europe&#x27;s most passenger-friendly railway station in an index created in 2020 by the Consumer Choice Center.

===Opening of Canal Tunnels===
From December 2018, as part of the Thameslink programme, services from the East Coast Main Line/Great Northern Route, also part of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, were linked to the Thameslink route, diverting trains previously terminating at Kings Cross into the Thameslink platforms at St Pancras and then through central London to Sussex and Kent. This link was made possible by the construction of a pair of single-track tunnels, named the Canal Tunnels; these tunnels start immediately off the St Pancras Thameslink platforms, dive under the Regent&#x27;s Canal, and join the East Coast Main Line where the North London Line and High Speed 1 pass over the top.

===Twinning===
In October 2019, St Pancras was twinned with the Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, Bordeaux, France. The association was made in the hope that a high-speed service could connect the two stations and was announced at a ceremony headed by Claude Solard, Director General of SNCF.

==Platform layout==

St Pancras contains four groups of platforms on two levels, accessed via the main concourse at ground level. The below-surface group contains through platforms A and B, and the upper level has three groups of terminal platforms: domestic platforms 1–4 and 11–13 on each side of international platforms 5–10. Platforms A &amp; B serve Thameslink, 1–4 connect to the Midland Main Line, while platforms 5–13 lead to High Speed 1; there is no connection between the two lines, except for a maintenance siding outside the station. There are also a variety of shops and restaurants within the station concourse.

The longer international platforms, used by Eurostar, extend into Barlow&#x27;s train shed, whilst the other platforms terminate at the southern end of the 2005 extension. The international platforms do not occupy the full width of the Barlow train shed, and sections of the floor area have been opened up to provide natural light to the new ground-level concourse below. Eurostar&#x27;s arrival and departure lounges lie below these platforms, adjacent to &quot;The Arcade&quot;, a concourse fashioned from the original station undercroft which runs along the western length of the Barlow train shed. The southern end of &quot;The Arcade&quot; links to the western ticket hall of King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station.

The East Midlands Railway platforms are at the northern end of &quot;The Arcade&quot;, while the Thameslink and domestic High Speed platforms are reached via a street-level concourse where the old and new parts of the station meet. The main pedestrian entrance is at the eastern end of this concourse, where a subway enables pedestrians to reach King&#x27;s Cross station and the northern ticket hall of the tube station.

==Domestic services==

===East Midlands Railway/Luton Airport Express===

Since 2019, platforms 1–4 have been the southern terminus for Midland Main Line services operated by East Midlands Railway under the &#x27;EMR InterCity&#x27; brand to/from the East Midlands and Yorkshire, including Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Chesterfield and Sheffield using &#x27;Meridian&#x27; diesel-electric multiple units. Occasional EMR InterCity services also run to and In 2025, a new &#x27;Aurora&#x27; fleet of bi-mode multiple units is scheduled to be introduced on InterCity services.

East Midlands Railway also operate semi-fast commuter services to and from and Corby from platforms 1–4, referred to as &#x27;Connect&#x27; services. As of 2023, this has been advertised as a separate brand, Luton Airport Express. Luton Airport Express operates Class 360 electric multiple units.

Previously, East Midlands Railway operated occasional services to Leeds, York and Scarborough. Trains to/from York and Scarborough ceased to operate from 2020 onwards, with services to Leeds being discontinued in spring 2022.

, the Monday-Saturday off-peak timetable sees six trains per hour (tph):
* 2 tph to via Luton Airport Parkway, Bedford and Kettering (Luton Airport Express)
* 2 tph to Nottingham (1 fast, 1 semi-fast) via Kettering, Market Harborough and Leicester
* 2 tph to Sheffield (1 fast, 1 semi-fast) via Leicester, Derby and Chesterfield

These platforms can also be used by Thameslink trains terminating here. In the regular timetable, a handful of Thameslink services use these platforms on Sunday mornings.

===Thameslink===

As part of the Thameslink Programme, St Pancras International gained platforms on the Thameslink route, replacing King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink to the south-east. In line with the former station, the Thameslink platforms are designated A and B.

The Thameslink Programme involves the introduction of 12-car trains across the enlarged Thameslink network. As extending the platforms at King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink was thought to be impractical (requiring alterations to Clerkenwell No 3 tunnel and the Circle/Hammersmith &amp; City/Metropolitan Underground lines, which would be extremely disruptive and prohibitively expensive), it was decided to build new Thameslink platforms under St Pancras.

The typical off-peak weekday Thameslink service sees 14 trains per hour (tph) in each direction:
* 4 tph to via St Albans City and Luton
* 2 tph to (semi-fast) via St Albans City
* 4 tph to (stopping) via Elstree &amp; Borehamwood
* 2 tph to via Stevenage
* 2 tph to via Stevenage and Letchworth Garden City
* 4 tph to via Gatwick Airport and Three Bridges
* 2 tph to Three Bridges via East Croydon
* 2 tph to via Dartford
* 2 tph to via Wimbledon
* 2 tph to Sutton via Mitcham Junction
* 2 tph to via Redhill and Three Bridges

There are additional peak-hour services to , , and .

===Southeastern===

Southeastern runs high-speed trains on High Speed 1 to Kent and the South East, to , , , , , , , and other destinations in Kent.

The first domestic service carrying passengers over High Speed 1 ran on 12 December 2008, to mark one year before regular services were due to begin. This special service, carrying various dignitaries, ran from Ashford International to St Pancras. Starting in June 2009, Southeastern provided a preview service between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, extending to Ashford International during peak hours. In September, Southeastern extended the peak-time services to Dover and Ramsgate. The full service began on 13 December.

The typical off-peak weekday Southeastern service sees four trains per hour (tph):
* 2 tph to via , of which 1 continues to 
* 1 tph to Ramsgate via 
* 1 tph to via .

Additional services, including two trains per day to and from run to and from the station during the peak hours.

===Olympic Javelin service===
During the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, St Pancras was the Central London terminus of the &quot;Olympic Javelin&quot; service, a seven-minute shuttle between Central London and Stratford International station for the London Olympic Park.

==International services==
Up to 39 Eurostar trains daily depart from St Pancras to and from either Paris Gare du Nord, Bruxelles-Midi/Brussel-Zuid and Amsterdam Centraal. Extra services run to Paris on Fridays and Sundays, with a reduced service to Brussels and Amsterdam at weekends. Additional weekend leisure-oriented trains run to the French Alps during the skiing season Some trains call additionally at Lille-Europe with some also running non-stop. Non-stop trains take 2 hours 15 minutes to Paris, and just under 1 hour 50 minutes to Brussels, other trains taking 5 or 10 minutes longer depending on whether they make one or two stops.

St Pancras International is one of four railway stations in the UK with juxtaposed immigration control facilities set up by the French Border Police to clear passengers for entry into France and the rest of the Schengen Area prior to boarding the trains. Passengers do not need any further immigration or passport checks after entering the main departure gates, or at the corresponding gate at the other end on return journeys, as they are cleared by the UK Border Force.

==Creative arts==

There are several works of art on public display at St Pancras. A high bronze statue titled &quot;The Meeting Place&quot; stands at the south end of the upper level beneath the station clock. It was designed by the British artist Paul Day to evoke the romance of travel through the depiction of a couple locked in an amorous embrace. Controversy was caused by Day&#x27;s 2008 addition of a bronze relief frieze around the plinth, depicting a commuter falling into the path of an Underground train driven by the Grim Reaper. Day revised the frieze before the final version was installed.
On the upper level, above the Arcade concourse, stands a bronze statue of John Betjeman, depicted gazing in apparent wonder at the Barlow roof. A work of the British sculptor Martin Jennings, the statue commemorates Betjeman&#x27;s part in a successful campaign to save the station from demolition in the 1960s. The -high statue stands on a flat disc of Cumbrian slate inscribed with lines from Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;Cornish Cliffs&quot;:
=== Public piano ===

There are a number of upright pianos in the main St Pancras concourse that are available for anyone to play. In 2016, Elton John gave an impromptu performance here on a piano he subsequently donated to the station as a gift.

== Hotel ==
In 1865, the Midland Railway Company held a competition for architects to design a hotel to front the station. George Gilbert Scott was persuaded to enter by his friend, Midland director Joseph Lewis, and completed the winning design at home while attending to his son who had fallen ill. Though plans were complete by the end of the year, financial pressure meant construction had to be delayed. Work eventually started in 1868 and the main section of the Midland Grand Hotel opened on 5 May 1873, with the west wing following three years later. The building is primarily brick, but polychromatic, in a style derived from the Italian gothic, and with numerous other architectural influences. Gilbert Scott reused many of the design details from his earlier work at Kelham Hall designed in 1857 and completed in 1863, but on a much grander scale for St Pancras.

The hotel closed in 1935 and was turned into St Pancras Chambers, a group of offices, with ownership retained by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (which was created when the Midland amalgamated with other railways). In the late 1980s, British Rail sold off and vacated the premises.

Following the decision to connect St Pancras to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, plans were made to restore the hotel for its original function. Planning permission was granted in 2005 and funded as part of a £50m Government plan to refurbish the station. The St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel occupies parts of the original building, including the main public rooms, together with a new bedroom wing on the western side of the Barlow train shed. The upper levels of the original building have been redeveloped as apartments by the Manhattan Loft Corporation. These have been sublet via Airbnb owing to their desirable location. The hotel held its grand opening on 5 May 2011, exactly 138 years after its original opening.

The hotel has been used as setting in several films, including &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992), &quot;Richard III&quot; (1995) and &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001). It was used for the filming of the Spice Girls&#x27; 1996 video, &quot;Wannabe&quot;.

==Accidents and incidents==

On 17 February 1918 a German Gotha aircraft dropped five bombs, one of which destroyed the roof of the station&#x27;s ornate booking hall and killed 20 people. The station was also bombed in World War II, including a parachute mine damaging the roof on 15–16 October 1940, and a bomb exploding in the beer vaults underneath Platform 3 on 10–11 May 1941.

On 20 July 1959, a locomotive overran a signal and crashed into Dock Junction Signal Box; trains had to be hand-signalled in and out of St Pancras for several days.

==Service patterns==




==Future developments==

===Competition with Eurostar===
In January 2010, the European railway network was opened to liberalisation to allow greater competition. Both Air France-KLM and Deutsche Bahn expressed interest in taking advantage of the new laws to run new services via High Speed 1 to St Pancras.

In December 2009, Deutsche Bahn received permission to run trains through the Channel Tunnel after safety requirements were relaxed. It had previously expressed a desire to run through trains between London and Germany. Direct trains between St Pancras and Cologne could have started before the 2012 Olympics, with plans to run a regular service of three daily trains each direction to Frankfurt, Rotterdam and Amsterdam via Brussels in 2013. Deutsche Bahn trains would be made up of two coupled sets between London and Brussels, dividing at Bruxelles-Midi/Brussel-Zuid. DB showcased an ICE 3 trainset in St Pancras in October 2010. The start date for these services was not expected before 2018. In March 2017 it was announced that Deutsche Bahn had revived plans for a London to Frankfurt train service taking 5 hours, with the service beginning as early as 2020, though plans were later shelved.

In February 2010, the idea of a Transmanche Metro service gained support as local councillors in Kent and Pas-de-Calais announced that they were in talks to establish a high-frequency stopping service between London and Lille. Trains would start at Lille Europe and call at Calais, Ashford International and Stratford International before reaching St Pancras. Since High Speed 1 opened, Ashford and Calais have an infrequent service and Eurostar trains do not call at Stratford International. It was hoped the service would be running by 2012 in time for the London Olympics. The mayor of Calais revived these plans in 2016, and said it could be operational in five years.

==London Underground station==
King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras Underground station serves both King&#x27;s Cross and St Pancras main-line stations. It is in fare zone 1. The station has two ticket halls, both of which can be accessed directly from the St Pancras concourse. The tube station is served by more lines than any other station on the London Underground. In , King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras was the station on the system, with million passengers entering and exiting the station.

The Underground station pre-dates the mainline as part of the initial section of Metropolitan Railway project on 10 January 1863, which was the first section of the London Underground to open. A separate station for the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (now the Piccadilly line) opened on 15 December 1906, with the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) opening on 12 May 1907. The Metropolitan Railway platforms were moved to their current location in 1941.

The Victoria line platforms were opened on 1 December 1968. A major expansion to accommodate High Speed 1 at St. Pancras opened in November 2009.

A pedestrian subway was built during the CTRL refurbishments. It runs under Pancras Road from the eastern entrance of the domestic concourse at St Pancras to the northern ticket hall of King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station (opened November 2009) and the concourse for King&#x27;s Cross (opened March 2012).

<doc id="311179" wikidata="Q1331978" url="?curid=311179" title="Ichi the Killer (film)">
<text>Ichi the Killer () is a 2001 Japanese horror yakuza film directed by Takashi Miike, written by Sakichi Sato, and starring Tadanobu Asano and Nao Omori. Based on Hideo Yamamoto&#x27;s manga series of the same name, its plot follows a psychologically damaged man who is manipulated into assaulting or killing rival faction members of feuding yakuza gangs while being pursued by a sadomasochistic enforcer.

The film has garnered controversy due to its graphic depictions of violence and cruelty and was subject to censorship in several countries.

== Plot ==
A man named Ichi stands on a balcony, masturbating while spying on a pimp raping and assaulting a prostitute. When the pimp discovers him, he flees.

Sadistic yakuza boss Anjo is murdered. A cleaning crew run by Jijii removes all traces of Anjo&#x27;s death and credits Ichi for the murder. Later, Kakihara, Anjo&#x27;s sadomasochistic high-ranking enforcer, visits the spotless apartment and concludes that Anjo fled town with a prostitute and three million yen of the clan&#x27;s money. Kakihara visits an underworld night club with other clan members. He tells Anjo&#x27;s girlfriend, an English-speaking Chinese prostitute named Karen, that Anjo must still be alive, perhaps kidnapped by a rival clan. Jijii feeds Kakihara rumors that Suzuki, a member of the rival Funaki clan, has kidnapped Anjo. Kakihara captures Suzuki and tortures him, but when Suzuki turns out to be innocent, Kakihara slices off the end of his own tongue and offers it to Suzuki&#x27;s boss as penance.

Kakihara and other clan members capture Kano, a drug-addled member of the cleaning crew. He reveals that although he helped clean up the murder scene, it was Ichi who killed Anjo, and that Kakihara has now been targeted. Later, Ichi returns to the pimp&#x27;s balcony to watch him brutalize Sailor, a prostitute of whom Ichi is a regular patron. Ichi eventually intervenes, killing the pimp and telling Sailor that he will now be the one to assault her. When Sailor tries to defend herself, Ichi reflexively kills her.

At Suzuki&#x27;s prompting, Kakihara is banished from the yakuza, but the entire Anjo clan defects with him. Suzuki then promises Jijii a million yen to kill Kakihara. Jijii, it is revealed, is secretly orchestrating events in order to pit yakuza clans against one another, with the help of Ichi. Though normally unassuming and cowardly, Ichi becomes homicidal and sexually aroused when enraged. Jijii is able to manipulate Ichi by implanting several false memories — a high school rape in particular — and uses Ichi as an assassin.

Ichi fights off three bullies attacking a boy named Takeshi. Takeshi is the son of Kaneko, one of Kakihara&#x27;s henchmen. Jijii incites Ichi to enter an apartment containing several members of the old Anjo clan and murder them all. Afterwards, Ichi sees Takeshi, who thanks him for the earlier protection. Kaneko finds a brothel-keeper assaulting Ichi in an alley and rescues him, remembering his own rescue by a member of the Anjo clan some years previously.

Kakihara enlists the help of corrupt twin police detectives, Jirō and Saburō, to find Myu-Myu, a prostitute connected with Ryu Long, a member of Jijii&#x27;s gang. When Jirō fails to get information from her through torture, Saburō tracks Long down. Though Long outruns the brothers, Kakihara captures him so the twins can torture him for leads to Jijii. Meanwhile, Jijii has Karen seduce Ichi by pretending to be the raped woman from his false memory. When Ichi becomes confused by Karen&#x27;s claims that she desired for him to rape and assault her, he kills her. Jijii informs Kakihara that Ichi is coming to kill him but is spotted by Takayama, one of Kakihara&#x27;s men. After a pursuit, Jijii, who is revealed to be surprisingly strong and muscular, disarms Takayama and kills him. Ichi then arrives at Kakihara&#x27;s base, where he kills Jirō and Saburō.

Kaneko, Kakihara and Ichi chase each other to a rooftop. Due to Jijii&#x27;s psychological manipulation, Ichi believes that Kaneko is his brother and confronts him. Kaneko shoots Ichi&#x27;s leg, and Ichi slits Kaneko&#x27;s throat in front of Takeshi. Takeshi attacks Ichi as he experiences a mental breakdown. Bewildered by Ichi&#x27;s behaviour and perturbed by his screams, Kakihara inserts his skewers into his own ears. He suddenly sees that Ichi has decapitated Takeshi. Ichi charges at Kakihara, embedding a bladed boot into his forehead. Kakihara falls from the roof to his death. However, when Jijii finds him, Kakihara has no wound in his head; he hallucinated both Takeshi&#x27;s murder and Ichi&#x27;s attack.

Years later, Jijii&#x27;s corpse hangs from a tree in a park. A young man resembling an older Takeshi leaves the park with a group of schoolchildren.

==Cast==
==Production==
The soundtrack was written and produced by Karera Musication, a side project of the Japanese band Boredoms, under the direction of ex-guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto and percussionist/band leader Yoshimi P-We.

==Themes==
Film journalist Tom Mes has suggested that the film is in fact a very sophisticated assessment of violence and its relation to the media and implicating the audience. He writes that &quot;It&#x27;s a paradox, but &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot;, a film that sets new boundaries in the portrayal of violence and bloodshed, takes a strongly critical stance towards the portrayal and the consumption of the violent image. However, it does so without ever taking a moral stance towards either the portrayal or the consumption, thus circumventing any accusations of hypocrisy on the part of the director. Miike does not moralise or chastise, but provokes the audience into questioning their own attitudes towards viewing images of violence. He steers them into a direction but leaves it up to them to draw their own conclusion&quot;.

Mes is also very critical of the edits made to the film. He argues that &quot;The film as a whole is a completely cohesive unity, in that all of its parts are absolutely crucial to the functioning of the whole. Any attempt at censorship or toning down the violence will have the opposite effect and will in fact make the film &quot;more&quot; exploitative and thereby undermine its critical stance. Excising scenes of violence, particularly the &#x27;painful&#x27; scenes, will harm the symbiosis between the &#x27;playful&#x27; and the &#x27;painful&#x27; violence, which forms the basis for Miike&#x27;s critical approach&quot;.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere in the Midnight Madness section at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival on 14 September 2001. It was released in Japan on 22 December 2001.

As a publicity gimmick, barf bags were received by viewers out at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) to those attending the midnight screening of this movie. Similar bags were given during the Stockholm International Film Festival. Reportedly, watching this film caused one viewer to throw up and another to faint. The British Board of Film Classification refused the release of the uncut film in the United Kingdom, citing &quot;scenes of mutilated, raped or savagely beaten women or of sexual pleasure from violence.&quot; A compulsory cut of three minutes and fifteen seconds of content was required for the film&#x27;s release; the cut version was passed with an 18 certificate. For the Hong Kong release, sixteen minutes and 59 seconds were cut. The movie has been banned outright in Norway and Malaysia, and banned for distribution in Germany.

In 2018, a digital restoration of the film was made by L&#x27;Immagine Ritrovata. The first public screening was at the HKIFF42.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 40 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 6.20/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Ichi The Killer&quot; is a thoroughly shocking gorefest that will surely entertain those with strong stomachs and a penchant for brutal violence.&quot; Metacritic reports a score of 55 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Some critics praised Miike&#x27;s stylish and narrative approach. Tanner Tafelski of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; noted, &quot;Miike layers a blood-stained commentary on a toxic world in which men offer protection to men but really end up dooming them to exist within a spasmodic, shambolic, and hypermasculine sphere of violence.&quot;

Other critics were more critical of the film&#x27;s extreme violence and found the film inconsistent. Dennis Harvey said for &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Even hardy gonzo-cinema auds will likely find the hectic pace overstimulating to the point of numbed-out tedium.&quot;

==Prequel==
The film was followed by a prequel, &quot;1-Ichi&quot;. Nao Omori reprises his role in the prequel, playing a younger version of Ichi.

<doc id="311180" wikidata="Q1976456" url="?curid=311180" title="Prout's hypothesis">
<text>Prout&#x27;s hypothesis was an early 19th-century attempt to explain the existence of the various chemical elements through a hypothesis regarding the internal structure of the atom. In 1815 and 1816, the English chemist William Prout published two papers in which he observed that the atomic weights that had been measured for the elements known at that time appeared to be whole multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. He then hypothesized that the hydrogen atom was the only truly fundamental object, which he called protyle, and that the atoms of other elements were actually groupings of various numbers of hydrogen atoms.

Prout&#x27;s hypothesis was an influence on Ernest Rutherford when he succeeded in &quot;knocking&quot; hydrogen nuclei out of nitrogen atoms with alpha particles in 1917, and thus concluded that perhaps the nuclei of all elements were made of such particles (the hydrogen nucleus), which in 1920 he suggested be named protons, from the suffix for particles, added to the stem of Prout&#x27;s word &quot;protyle&quot;. The assumption as discussed by Rutherford was of a nucleus consisting of Z + N = A protons plus N electrons somehow trapped within thereby reducing the positive charge to +Z as observed and vaguely explaining beta decay radioactivity. Such a nuclear constitution was known to be inconsistent with dynamics either classical or early quantum but seemed inevitable until the neutron hypothesis by Rutherford and discovery by English physicist James Chadwick.

The discrepancy between Prout&#x27;s hypothesis and the known variation of some atomic weights to values far from integral multiples of hydrogen, was explained between 1913 and 1932 by the discovery of isotopes and the neutron. According to the whole number rule of Francis Aston, Prout&#x27;s hypothesis is correct for atomic masses of individual isotopes, with an error of at most 1%.

==Influence==
Prout&#x27;s hypothesis remained influential in chemistry throughout the 1820s. However, more careful measurements of the atomic weights, such as those compiled by Jacob Berzelius in 1828 or Edward Turner in 1832, disproved the hypothesis. In particular, the atomic weight of chlorine, which is 35.45 times that of hydrogen, could not at the time be explained in terms of Prout&#x27;s hypothesis. Some came up with the ad hoc claim that the basic unit was one-half of a hydrogen atom, but further discrepancies surfaced. This resulted in the hypothesis that one-quarter of a hydrogen atom was the common unit. Although they turned out to be wrong, these conjectures catalyzed further measurement of atomic weights.

The discrepancy in the atomic weights was by 1919 suspected to be the result of the natural occurrence of multiple isotopes of the same element. F. W. Aston discovered multiple stable isotopes for numerous elements using a mass spectrograph. In 1919, Aston studied neon with sufficient resolution to show that the two isotopic masses are very close to the integers 20 and 22, and that neither is equal to the known molar mass (20.2) of neon gas.

By 1925, the problematic chlorine was found to be composed of the isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl, in proportions such that the average weight of natural chlorine was about 35.45 times that of hydrogen. For all elements, each individual isotope of mass number &quot;A&quot; was eventually found to have a mass very close to &quot;A&quot; times the mass of a hydrogen atom, with an error always less than 1%. This is a near miss to Prout&#x27;s law being correct. Nevertheless, the rule was not found to predict isotope masses better than this for all isotopes, due mostly to mass defects resulting from release of binding energy in atomic nuclei when they are formed.

Although all elements are the product of nuclear fusion of hydrogen into higher elements, it is now understood that atoms consist of both protons (hydrogen nuclei) and neutrons. The modern version of Prout&#x27;s rule is that the atomic mass of an isotope of proton number (atomic number) &quot;Z&quot; and neutron number &quot;N&quot; is equal to sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, minus the mass of the nuclear binding energy, the mass defect. According to the whole number rule proposed by Francis Aston, the mass of an isotope is roughly, but not exactly, its mass number &quot;A&quot; (&quot;Z&quot; + &quot;N&quot;) times an atomic mass unit (u), plus or minus binding energy discrepancy – atomic mass unit being the modern approximation for &quot;mass of a proton, neutron, or hydrogen atom&quot;. For example iron-56 atoms (which have among the highest binding-energies) weigh only about 99.1% as much as 56 hydrogen atoms. The missing 0.9% of mass represents the energy lost when the nucleus of iron was made from hydrogen inside a star (see stellar nucleosynthesis).

==Literary allusions==
In his 1891 novel &quot;The Doings of Raffles Haw&quot;, Arthur Conan Doyle talks about turning elements into other elements of decreasing atomic number, until a gray matter is reached.

In his 1959 novel &quot;Life and Fate&quot;, Vasily Grossman&#x27;s principal character, the physicist Viktor Shtrum, reflects on Prout&#x27;s hypothesis about hydrogen being the origin of other elements (and the felicitous fact that Prout&#x27;s incorrect data led to an essentially correct conclusion), as he worries about his inability to formulate his own thesis.

<text>Berzelius (BZ) is a secret society for seniors at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. The society was established in 1848. It was named for the Swedish scientist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, considered one of the founding fathers of modern chemistry.

== History ==
Berzelius is a secret society established as the Colony Club in 1848 at Sheffield Scientific School, a former school of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. One of its founding members was William Henry Brewer. The club was housed on campus in Berzelius Hall, named for the Swedish scientist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, considered one of the founding fathers of modern chemistry. Eventually, the Colony Club started using the name Berzelius.

BZ, as the society is called often, is the third oldest society at Yale and the oldest of those of the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School, the institution which from 1854 to 1956 was the sciences and engineering college of Yale University. Berzelius became a senior society in the tradition of Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf&#x27;s Head in 1933 when the Sheffield Scientific School was integrated into Yale University.

The society takes its intellectual mission seriously, invoking Socrates&#x27; exhortation &quot;The unexamined life is not worth living” as well as stating to its prospective members that: &quot;Berzelius provides opportunities for achieving insights through an open, honest exchange of experiences, passions, and opinions. This process prepares its members — whose diversity is highly valued — for an active, intellectually vigorous, and moral life, giving them a place and time for contemplation and reflection so that they might rise boldly to the challenges of their lives, devoted to good character, tolerant of others, and willing to serve their communities while forging links of mind to mind in a chain unbroken.&quot;

The society&#x27;s corporate name is Colony Foundation, changed from the Bezelius Trust Association in 1951.

== Buildings ==
The Colony Club originally had meeting rooms in Berzelius Hall on the Sheffield campus. In 1898, the society built a house called The Colony; it was the residence of the senior members of Berzelius. Architects Henry Bacon and James Brite designed the Colonial Revival and Neoclassical brick residence on Hillside Avenue. Yale purchased the BZ dormitory in 1933 for student housing, later using it for faculty offices. It was demolished in 1969 to make way for the Yale Health Services Center.

In 1910, the Berzelius Trust Association purchased property at 78 Trumbull Street in New Haven to construct a new building or tomb for BZ&#x27;s meeting place. Berzelius member and architect Donn Barber designed the building to resemble a Greek temple. The limestone neoclassical tomb was completed in 1910. BZ&#x27;s building is called a tomb, the customary appellation for a secret society structure at Yale. However, many BZ members refer to their building as The Hall. This is likely a transferred linguistic remnant of the tradition of Sheffield&#x27;s secret societies, which had halls for residential use and tombs as separate meeting places, in contrast to the Yale College senior secret societies, which maintained only tombs.

The BZ tomb is set off from the more active center of Yale&#x27;s campus, providing privacy for Berzelius&#x27; members, and its unadorned largely blank exterior conveys to outsiders the deceptive sense that nothing much happens inside. In addition to the meeting room, dining area, and numerous study rooms, there are below-ground activity rooms with a pool table and ping pong table for recreation. Its exterior is plain but does have a roof with a balustrade and detailed cornice, double brass doors with floral ornamentation, and a carved limestone detail showing the society&#x27;s insignia above the entrance. In 2002, BZ&#x27;s tomb underwent a major restoration.

<text>John Randolph Lucas (18 June 1929 – 5 April 2020) was a British philosopher.

== Biography ==
Lucas was educated at Winchester College and then, as a pupil of R.M. Hare, among others, at Balliol College, Oxford. He studied first mathematics, then Greats (Greek, Latin, Philosophy and Ancient History), obtaining first class honours in both. He sat for Finals in 1951, and took his MA in 1954. He spent the 1957–58 academic year at Princeton University, studying mathematics and logic. For 36 years, until his 1996 retirement, he was a Fellow and Tutor of Merton College, Oxford, and he remained an emeritus member of the University Faculty of Philosophy. He was a Fellow of the British Academy.

Lucas is perhaps best known for his paper &quot;Minds, Machines and Gödel,&quot; arguing that an automaton cannot represent a human mathematician, attempting to refute computationalism.

An author with diverse teaching and research interests, Lucas wrote on the philosophy of mathematics, especially the implications of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, the philosophy of mind, free will and determinism, the philosophy of science including one book on physics co-authored with Peter E. Hodgson, causality, political philosophy, ethics and business ethics, and the philosophy of religion.

The son of a Church of England clergyman, and an Anglican himself, Lucas described himself as &quot;a dyed-in-the-wool traditional Englishman.&quot; He had four children (Edward, Helen, Richard and Deborah) with Morar Portal, among them Edward Lucas, a former journalist at &quot;The Economist&quot;.

In addition to his philosophical career, Lucas had a practical interest in business ethics. He helped found the Oxford Consumers&#x27; Group, and was its first chairman in 1961–3, serving again in 1965.

==Philosophical contributions==

===Free will===
Lucas (1961) began a lengthy and heated debate over the implications of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems for the anthropic mechanism thesis, by arguing that:
# Determinism ↔ For any human &quot;h&quot; there exists at least one (deterministic) logical system &quot;L&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) which reliably predicts &quot;h&quot;&#x27;s actions in all circumstances.
# For any logical system &quot;L&quot; a sufficiently skilled mathematical logician (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) can construct some statements &quot;T&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) which are true but unprovable in &quot;L&quot;. (This follows from Gödel&#x27;s first theorem.) 
# If a human &quot;m&quot; is a sufficiently skillful mathematical logician (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) then if &quot;m&quot; is given &quot;L&quot;(&quot;m&quot;), he or she can construct &quot;T&quot;(&quot;L&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)) and determine that they are true—which &quot;L&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) cannot do.
# Hence &quot;L&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) does not reliably predict &quot;m&quot;&#x27;s actions in all circumstances.
# Hence &quot;m&quot; has free will.
# It is implausible that the qualitative difference between mathematical logicians and the rest of the population is such that the former have free will and the latter do not.

His argument was strengthened by the discovery by Hava Siegelmann in the 1990s that sufficiently complex analogue recurrent neural networks are more powerful than Turing Machines.

===Space, time and causality===
Lucas wrote several books on the philosophy of science and space-time (see below). In &quot;A treatise on time and space&quot; he introduced a transcendental derivation of the Lorenz Transformations based on Red and Blue exchanging messages (in Russian and Greek respectively) from their respective frames of reference which demonstrates how these can be derived from a minimal set of philosophical assumptions.

In &quot;The Future&quot; Lucas gives a detailed analysis of tenses and time, arguing that &quot;the Block universe gives a deeply inadequate view of time. It fails to account for the passage of time, the pre-eminence of the present, the directedness of time and the difference between the future and the past&quot; and in favour of a tree structure in which there is only one past or present (at any given point in spacetime) but a large number of possible futures. &quot;We are by our own decisions in the face of other men&#x27;s actions and chance circumstances weaving the web of history on the loom of natural necessity&quot;

<text>Air Georgian Limited was a privately owned charter airline based at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Between 2000 and 2020 its main business was its operation as Air Canada Express on a Tier III codeshare with Air Canada for scheduled services on domestic and trans-border routes. Starting in 2020 Air Georgian began focusing on air charters, before ceasing operations in May, after a sale of its assets to Pivot Airlines, a company run by the same executives.

Air Georgian operated under the Subparts 704 and 705 of the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CAR 704, CAR 705) and had completed the IATA Operational Safety Audit. Air Georgian pilots were represented by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA).

==History==
Air Georgian began as an airport developer in 1985. It began commercial operations in 1994 and subsequently developed its commercial air carrier business, which as of 2011 represented 87 percent of its total business. In 1997 It became a code share partner of Canadian Airlines, operating under the banner of Ontario Regional. Air Georgian was a partner of Canadian Airlines. In 2000 Air Georgian became a Tier III partner of Air Canada and operated as Air Canada Alliance.

It had a long time cargo operation known as Georgian Express which was sold to Cargojet in 2007.

On November 15, 2013, Air Georgian and Regional 1 merged operations through the creation of a parent company, Regional Express Aviation Ltd. (REAL), based in Calgary, Alberta. This joint venture ended in February 2016.

In December 2013, Air Canada announced that commencing in mid-2014, Air Georgian would operate additional routes in Canada and the United States using Air Canada CRJ100/200 aircraft. CRJ operations on behalf of Air Canada Express began on May 1, 2014.

In 2019, Air Canada indicated it was ending its relationship with the company, consolidating its CRJ regional capacity into the Jazz Aviation operation. On January 31, 2020, Air Georgian filed notice of intent for bankruptcy protection. On March 16, 2020, Air Georgian received court approval for an asset purchase agreement with Pivot Airlines (2746904 Ontario Inc) for substantially all the assets, properties and undertakings of the company. Pivot Airlines is a new company whose CEO as well as Maintenance Operations and Flight Operations Vice Presidents are the same as Air Georgian&#x27;s. On May 29, 2020, the transaction was completed, however, the June 1 deadline to make a proposal to exit bankruptcy protection passed and no proposal having been made, the company was declared bankrupt the following day.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Air Georgian had begun offering repatriation flights.

==Fleet==
At the time of bankruptcy, the Canadian Civil Aircraft Register showed 14 aircraft registered for Air Georgian Limited. As of August 2021, Transport Canada shows that Air Georgian had operated the following 89 aircraft:

<doc id="311193" wikidata="Q656083" url="?curid=311193" title="Memory paging">
<text>In computer operating systems, memory paging (or swapping on some Unix-like systems) is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage for use in main memory. In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called &quot;pages&quot;. Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating systems, using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory.

For simplicity, main memory is called &quot;RAM&quot; (an acronym of random-access memory) and secondary storage is called &quot;disk&quot; (a shorthand for hard disk drive, drum memory or solid-state drive, etc.), but as with many aspects of computing, the concepts are independent of the technology used.

Depending on the memory model, paged memory functionality is usually hardwired into a CPU/MCU by using a Memory Management Unit (MMU) or Memory Protection Unit (MPU) and separately enabled by privileged system code in the operating system&#x27;s kernel. In CPUs implementing the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) for instance, the memory paging is enabled via the CR0 control register.

== History ==
In the 1960s, swapping was an early virtual memory technique. An entire program or entire segment would be &quot;swapped out&quot; (or &quot;rolled out&quot;) from RAM to disk or drum, and another one would be &quot;swapped in&quot; (or &quot;rolled in&quot;). A swapped-out program would be current but its execution would be suspended while its RAM was in use by another program; a program with a swapped-out segment could continue running until it needed that segment, at which point it would be suspended until the segment was swapped in.

A program might include multiple overlays that occupy the same memory at different times. Overlays are not a method of paging RAM to disk but merely of minimizing the program&#x27;s RAM use. Subsequent architectures used memory segmentation, and individual program segments became the units exchanged between disk and RAM. A segment was the program&#x27;s entire code segment or data segment, or sometimes other large data structures. These segments had to be contiguous when resident in RAM, requiring additional computation and movement to remedy fragmentation.

Ferranti&#x27;s Atlas, and the Atlas Supervisor developed at the University of Manchester, (1962), was the first system to implement memory paging. Subsequent early machines, and their operating systems, supporting paging include the IBM M44/44X and its MOS operating system (1964), the SDS 940 and the Berkeley Timesharing System (1966), a modified IBM System/360 Model 40 and the CP-40 operating system (1967), the IBM System/360 Model 67 and operating systems such as TSS/360 and CP/CMS (1967), the RCA 70/46 and the Time Sharing Operating System (1967), the GE 645 and Multics (1969), and the PDP-10 with added BBN-designed paging hardware and the TENEX operating system (1969).

Those machines, and subsequent machines supporting memory paging, use either a set of page address registers or in-memory page tables to allow the processor to operate on arbitrary pages anywhere in RAM as a seemingly contiguous logical address space. These pages became the units exchanged between disk and RAM.

==Page faults==
When a process tries to reference a page not currently mapped to a page frame in RAM, the processor treats this invalid memory reference as a page fault and transfers control from the program to the operating system. The operating system must:
# Determine whether a stolen page frame still contains an unmodified copy of the page; if so, use that page frame.
# Otherwise, obtain an empty page frame in RAM to use as a container for the data, and:
#* Determine whether the page was ever initialized
#* If so determine the location of the data on disk.
#* Load the required data into the available page frame.
# Update the page table to refer to the new page frame.
# Return control to the program, transparently retrying the instruction that caused the page fault.

When all page frames are in use, the operating system must select a page frame to reuse for the page the program now needs. If the evicted page frame was dynamically allocated by a program to hold data, or if a program modified it since it was read into RAM (in other words, if it has become &quot;dirty&quot;), it must be written out to disk before being freed. If a program later references the evicted page, another page fault occurs and the page must be read back into RAM.

The method the operating system uses to select the page frame to reuse, which is its page replacement algorithm, is important to efficiency. The operating system predicts the page frame least likely to be needed soon, often through the least recently used (LRU) algorithm or an algorithm based on the program&#x27;s working set. To further increase responsiveness, paging systems may predict which pages will be needed soon, preemptively loading them into RAM before a program references them, and may steal page frames from pages that have been unreferenced for a long time, making them available. Some systems clear new pages to avoid data leaks that compromise security; some set them to installation defined or random values to aid debugging.

== Page fetching techniques ==
=== Demand paging ===

When pure demand paging is used, pages are loaded only when they are referenced. A program from a memory mapped file begins execution with none of its pages in RAM. As the program commits page faults, the operating system copies the needed pages from a file, e.g., memory-mapped file, paging file, or a swap partition containing the page data into RAM.
=== Anticipatory paging ===
Some systems use only demand paging—waiting until a page is actually requested before loading it into RAM.

Other systems attempt to reduce latency by guessing which pages not in RAM are likely to be needed soon, and pre-loading such pages into RAM, before that page is requested. (This is often in combination with pre-cleaning, which guesses which pages currently in RAM are not likely to be needed soon, and pre-writing them out to storage).

When a page fault occurs, anticipatory paging systems will not only bring in the referenced page, but also other pages that are likely to be referenced soon. A simple anticipatory paging algorithm will bring in the next few consecutive pages even though they are not yet needed (a prediction using locality of reference); this is analogous to a prefetch input queue in a CPU. Swap prefetching will prefetch recently swapped-out pages if there are enough free pages for them.

If a program ends, the operating system may delay freeing its pages, in case the user runs the same program again.

== Page replacement techniques ==

=== Free page queue, stealing, and reclamation ===
The free page queue is a list of page frames that are available for assignment. Preventing this queue from being empty minimizes the computing necessary to service a page fault. Some operating systems periodically look for pages that have not been recently referenced and then free the page frame and add it to the free page queue, a process known as &quot;page stealing&quot;. Some operating systems support &quot;page reclamation&quot;; if a program commits a page fault by referencing a page that was stolen, the operating system detects this and restores the page frame without having to read the contents back into RAM.

=== Pre-cleaning ===
The operating system may periodically pre-clean dirty pages: write modified pages back to disk even though they might be further modified. This minimizes the amount of cleaning needed to obtain new page frames at the moment a new program starts or a new data file is opened, and improves responsiveness. (Unix operating systems periodically use sync to pre-clean all dirty pages; Windows operating systems use &quot;modified page writer&quot; threads.)

==Thrashing==
After completing initialization, most programs operate on a small number of code and data pages compared to the total memory the program requires. The pages most frequently accessed are called the working set.

When the working set is a small percentage of the system&#x27;s total number of pages, virtual memory systems work most efficiently and an insignificant amount of computing is spent resolving page faults. As the working set grows, resolving page faults remains manageable until the growth reaches a critical point. Then faults go up dramatically and the time spent resolving them overwhelms time spent on the computing the program was written to do. This condition is referred to as thrashing. Thrashing occurs on a program that works with huge data structures, as its large working set causes continual page faults that drastically slow down the system. Satisfying page faults may require freeing pages that will soon have to be re-read from disk. &quot;Thrashing&quot; is also used in contexts other than virtual memory systems; for example, to describe cache issues in computing or silly window syndrome in networking.

A worst case might occur on VAX processors. A single MOVL crossing a page boundary could have a source operand using a displacement deferred addressing mode, where the longword containing the operand address crosses a page boundary, and a destination operand using a displacement deferred addressing mode, where the longword containing the operand address crosses a page boundary, and the source and destination could both cross page boundaries. This single instruction references ten pages; if not all are in RAM, each will cause a page fault. As each fault occurs the operating system needs to go through the extensive memory management routines perhaps causing multiple I/Os which might include writing other process pages to disk and reading pages of the active process from disk. If the operating system could not allocate ten pages to this program, then remedying the page fault would discard another page the instruction needs, and any restart of the instruction would fault again.

To decrease excessive paging and resolve thrashing problems, a user can increase the number of pages available per program, either by running fewer programs concurrently or increasing the amount of RAM in the computer.

==Sharing==
In multi-programming or in a multi-user environment, many users may execute the same program, written so that its code and data are in separate pages. To minimize RAM use, all users share a single copy of the program. Each process&#x27;s page table is set up so that the pages that address code point to the single shared copy, while the pages that address data point to different physical pages for each process.

Different programs might also use the same libraries. To save space, only one copy of the shared library is loaded into physical memory. Programs which use the same library have virtual addresses that map to the same pages (which contain the library&#x27;s code and data). When programs want to modify the library&#x27;s code, they use copy-on-write, so memory is only allocated when needed.

Shared memory is an efficient means of communication between programs. Programs can share pages in memory, and then write and read to exchange data.

==Implementations==

===Ferranti Atlas===
The first computer to support paging was the supercomputer Atlas, jointly developed by Ferranti, the University of Manchester and Plessey in 1963. The machine had an associative (content-addressable) memory with one entry for each 512 word page. The Supervisor handled non-equivalence interruptions and managed the transfer of pages between core and drum in order to provide a one-level store to programs.

===Microsoft Windows===

====Windows 3.x and Windows 9x====
Paging has been a feature of Microsoft Windows since Windows 3.0 in 1990. Windows 3.x creates a hidden file named codice_1 or codice_2 for use as a swap file. It is generally found in the root directory, but it may appear elsewhere (typically in the WINDOWS directory). Its size depends on how much swap space the system has (a setting selected by the user under Control Panel → Enhanced under &quot;Virtual Memory&quot;). If the user moves or deletes this file, a blue screen will appear the next time Windows is started, with the error message &quot;The permanent swap file is corrupt&quot;. The user will be prompted to choose whether or not to delete the file (even if it does not exist).

Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me use a similar file, and the settings for it are located under Control Panel → System → Performance tab → Virtual Memory. Windows automatically sets the size of the page file to start at 1.5× the size of physical memory, and expand up to 3× physical memory if necessary. If a user runs memory-intensive applications on a system with low physical memory, it is preferable to manually set these sizes to a value higher than default.

====Windows NT====
The file used for paging in the Windows NT family is codice_3. The default location of the page file is in the root directory of the partition where Windows is installed. Windows can be configured to use free space on any available drives for page files. It is required, however, for the boot partition (i.e., the drive containing the Windows directory) to have a page file on it if the system is configured to write either kernel or full memory dumps after a Blue Screen of Death. Windows uses the paging file as temporary storage for the memory dump. When the system is rebooted, Windows copies the memory dump from the page file to a separate file and frees the space that was used in the page file.

====Fragmentation====
In the default configuration of Windows, the page file is allowed to expand beyond its initial allocation when necessary. If this happens gradually, it can become heavily fragmented which can potentially cause performance problems. The common advice given to avoid this is to set a single &quot;locked&quot; page file size so that Windows will not expand it. However, the page file only expands when it has been filled, which, in its default configuration, is 150% of the total amount of physical memory. Thus the total demand for page file-backed virtual memory must exceed 250% of the computer&#x27;s physical memory before the page file will expand.

The fragmentation of the page file that occurs when it expands is temporary. As soon as the expanded regions are no longer in use (at the next reboot, if not sooner) the additional disk space allocations are freed and the page file is back to its original state.

Locking a page file size can be problematic if a Windows application requests more memory than the total size of physical memory and the page file, leading to failed requests to allocate memory that may cause applications and system processes to fail. Also, the page file is rarely read or written in sequential order, so the performance advantage of having a completely sequential page file is minimal. However, a large page file generally allows the use of memory-heavy applications, with no penalties besides using more disk space. While a fragmented page file may not be an issue by itself, fragmentation of a variable size page file will over time create several fragmented blocks on the drive, causing other files to become fragmented. For this reason, a fixed-size contiguous page file is better, providing that the size allocated is large enough to accommodate the needs of all applications.

The required disk space may be easily allocated on systems with more recent specifications (i.e. a system with 3 GB of memory having a 6 GB fixed-size page file on a 750 GB disk drive, or a system with 6 GB of memory and a 16 GB fixed-size page file and 2 TB of disk space). In both examples, the system uses about 0.8% of the disk space with the page file pre-extended to its maximum.

Defragmenting the page file is also occasionally recommended to improve performance when a Windows system is chronically using much more memory than its total physical memory. This view ignores the fact that, aside from the temporary results of expansion, the page file does not become fragmented over time. In general, performance concerns related to page file access are much more effectively dealt with by adding more physical memory.

===Unix and Unix-like systems===
Unix systems, and other Unix-like operating systems, use the term &quot;swap&quot; to describe the act of substituting disk space for RAM when physical RAM is full. In some of those systems, it is common to dedicate an entire partition of a hard disk to swapping. These partitions are called &quot;swap partitions&quot;. Many systems have an entire hard drive dedicated to swapping, separate from the data drive(s), containing only a swap partition. A hard drive dedicated to swapping is called a &quot;swap drive&quot; or a &quot;scratch drive&quot; or a &quot;scratch disk&quot;. Some of those systems only support swapping to a swap partition; others also support swapping to files.

==== Linux ====
The Linux kernel supports a virtually unlimited number of swap backends (devices or files), and also supports assignment of backend priorities. When the kernel swaps pages out of physical memory, it uses the highest-priority backend with available free space. If multiple swap backends are assigned the same priority, they are used in a round-robin fashion (which is somewhat similar to RAID 0 storage layouts), providing improved performance as long as the underlying devices can be efficiently accessed in parallel.

===== Swap files and partitions =====

From the end-user perspective, swap files in versions 2.6.x and later of the Linux kernel are virtually as fast as swap partitions; the limitation is that swap files should be contiguously allocated on their underlying file systems. To increase performance of swap files, the kernel keeps a map of where they are placed on underlying devices and accesses them directly, thus bypassing the cache and avoiding filesystem overhead. When residing on HDDs, which are rotational magnetic media devices, one benefit of using swap partitions is the ability to place them on contiguous HDD areas that provide higher data throughput or faster seek time. However, the administrative flexibility of swap files can outweigh certain advantages of swap partitions. For example, a swap file can be placed on any mounted file system, can be set to any desired size, and can be added or changed as needed. Swap partitions are not as flexible; they cannot be enlarged without using partitioning or volume management tools, which introduce various complexities and potential downtimes.

===== Swappiness =====
&quot;Swappiness&quot; is a Linux kernel parameter that controls the relative weight given to swapping out of runtime memory, as opposed to dropping pages from the system page cache, whenever a memory allocation request cannot be met from free memory. Swappiness can be set to a value from 0 to 200. A low value causes the kernel to prefer to evict pages from the page cache while a higher value causes the kernel to prefer to swap out &quot;cold&quot; memory pages. The default value is codice_4; setting it higher can cause high latency if cold pages need to be swapped back in (when interacting with a program that had been idle for example), while setting it lower (even 0) may cause high latency when files that had been evicted from the cache need to be read again, but will make interactive programs more responsive as they will be less likely to need to swap back cold pages. Swapping can also slow down HDDs further because it involves a lot of random writes, while SSDs do not have this problem. Certainly the default values work well in most workloads, but desktops and interactive systems for any expected task may want to lower the setting while batch processing and less interactive systems may want to increase it.

===== Swap death =====

When the system memory is highly insufficient for the current tasks and a large portion of memory activity goes through a slow swap, the system can become practically unable to execute any task, even if the CPU is idle. When every process is waiting on the swap, the system is considered to be in &quot;swap death&quot;.

Swap death can happen due to incorrectly configured memory overcommitment.

The original description of the &quot;swapping to death&quot; problem relates to the X server. If code or data used by the X server to respond to a keystroke is not in main memory, then if the user enters a keystroke, the server will take one or more page faults, requiring those pages to read from swap before the keystroke can be processed, slowing the response to it. If those pages do not remain in memory, they will have to be faulted in again to handle the next keystroke, making the system practically unresponsive even if it&#x27;s actually executing other tasks normally.

====macOS====
macOS uses multiple swap files. The default (and Apple-recommended) installation places them on the root partition, though it is possible to place them instead on a separate partition or device.

===AmigaOS 4===
AmigaOS 4.0 introduced a new system for allocating RAM and defragmenting physical memory. It still uses flat shared address space that cannot be defragmented. It is based on slab allocation method and paging memory that allows swapping. Paging was implemented in AmigaOS 4.1 but may lock up system if all physical memory is used up. Swap memory could be activated and deactivated any moment allowing the user to choose to use only physical RAM.

==Performance==
The backing store for a virtual memory operating system is typically many orders of magnitude slower than RAM. Additionally, using mechanical storage devices introduces delay, several milliseconds for a hard disk. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce or eliminate swapping, where practical. Some operating systems offer settings to influence the kernel&#x27;s decisions.
* Linux offers the codice_5 parameter, which changes the balance between swapping out runtime memory, as opposed to dropping pages from the system page cache.
* Windows 2000, XP, and Vista offer the codice_6 registry setting, which controls whether kernel-mode code and data can be eligible for paging out.
* Mainframe computers frequently used head-per-track disk drives or drums for page and swap storage to eliminate seek time, and several technologies to have multiple concurrent requests to the same device in order to reduce rotational latency.
* Flash memory has a finite number of erase-write cycles (see limitations of flash memory), and the smallest amount of data that can be erased at once might be very large (128 KiB for an Intel X25-M SSD ), seldom coinciding with pagesize. Therefore, flash memory may wear out quickly if used as swap space under tight memory conditions. On the attractive side, flash memory is practically delayless compared to hard disks, and not volatile as RAM chips. Schemes like ReadyBoost and Intel Turbo Memory are made to exploit these characteristics.

Many Unix-like operating systems (for example AIX, Linux, and Solaris) allow using multiple storage devices for swap space in parallel, to increase performance.

=== Swap space size ===
In some older virtual memory operating systems, space in swap backing store is reserved when programs allocate memory for runtime data. Operating system vendors typically issue guidelines about how much swap space should be allocated.

== Physical and virtual address space sizes ==
Paging is one way of allowing the size of the addresses used by a process, which is the process&#x27;s &quot;virtual address space&quot; or &quot;logical address space&quot;, to be different from the amount of main memory actually installed on a particular computer, which is the physical address space.

=== Main memory smaller than virtual memory ===
In most systems, the size of a process&#x27;s virtual address space is much larger than the available main memory. For example:
* The address bus that connects the CPU to main memory may be limited. The i386SX CPU&#x27;s 32-bit internal addresses can address 4 GB, but it has only 24 pins connected to the address bus, limiting installed physical memory to 16 MB. There may be other hardware restrictions on the maximum amount of RAM that can be installed.
* The maximum memory might not be installed because of cost, because the model&#x27;s standard configuration omits it, or because the buyer did not believe it would be advantageous.
* Sometimes not all internal addresses can be used for memory anyway, because the hardware architecture may reserve large regions for I/O or other features.

=== Main memory the same size as virtual memory ===
A computer with true &quot;n&quot;-bit addressing may have 2 addressable units of RAM installed. An example is a 32-bit x86 processor with 4 GB and without Physical Address Extension (PAE). In this case, the processor is able to address all the RAM installed and no more.

However, even in this case, paging can be used to support more virtual memory than physical memory. For instance, many programs may be running concurrently. Together, they may require more physical memory than can be installed on the system, but not all of it will have to be in RAM at once. A paging system makes efficient decisions on which memory to relegate to secondary storage, leading to the best use of the installed RAM.

In addition the operating system may provide services to programs that envision a larger memory, such as files that can grow beyond the limit of installed RAM. Not all of the file can be concurrently mapped into the address space of a process, but the operating system might allow regions of the file can be mapped into the address space, and unmapped if another region needs to be mapped in.

=== Main memory larger than virtual address space ===
A few computers have a main memory larger than the virtual address space of a process, such as the Magic-1, some PDP-11 machines, and some systems using 32-bit x86 processors with Physical Address Extension. This nullifies a significant advantage of paging, since a single process cannot use more main memory than the amount of its virtual address space. Such systems often use paging techniques to obtain secondary benefits:
* The &quot;extra memory&quot; can be used in the page cache to cache frequently used files and metadata, such as directory information, from secondary storage.
* If the processor and operating system support multiple virtual address spaces, the &quot;extra memory&quot; can be used to run more processes. Paging allows the cumulative total of virtual address spaces to exceed physical main memory.
* A process can store data in memory-mapped files on memory-backed file systems, such as the tmpfs file system or file systems on a RAM drive, and map files into and out of the address space as needed.
* A set of processes may still depend upon the enhanced security features page-based isolation may bring to a multitasking environment.

The size of the cumulative total of virtual address spaces is still limited by the amount of secondary storage available.

<text>Louis Dearborn L&#x27;Amour (; né LaMoore; March 22, 1908 – June 10, 1988) was an American novelist and short story writer. His books consisted primarily of Western novels, though he called his work &quot;frontier stories&quot;. His most widely known Western fiction works include &quot;Last of the Breed&quot;, &quot;Hondo&quot;, &quot;Shalako&quot;, and the Sackett series&quot;.&quot; L&#x27;Amour also wrote historical fiction (&quot;The Walking Drum&quot;), science fiction (&quot;The Haunted Mesa&quot;), non-fiction (&quot;Frontier&quot;), and poetry and short-story collections. Many of his stories were made into films. His books remain popular and most have gone through multiple printings. At the time of his death, almost all of his 105 existing works (89 novels, 14 short-story collections, and two full-length works of nonfiction) were still in print, and he was &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most popular writers&quot;.

== Life and career ==
===Early life===
Louis Dearborn LaMoore was born in Jamestown, North Dakota, on March 22, 1908, the seventh child of Emily Dearborn and veterinarian, local politician, and farm equipment broker Louis Charles LaMoore (who had changed the French spelling of the name L&#x27;Amour). His mother had Irish ancestry, while his father was of French-Canadian descent. His father had arrived in Dakota Territory in 1882. Although the area around Jamestown was mostly farm land, cowboys and livestock often traveled through Jamestown on their way to or from ranches in Montana and the markets to the east. Louis played &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; in the family barn, which served as his father&#x27;s veterinary hospital, and spent much of his free time at the local library, the Alfred E. Dickey Free Library, particularly reading the works of 19th-century British historical boys&#x27; author G. A. Henty. L&#x27;Amour once said, &quot;[Henty&#x27;s works] enabled me to go into school with a great deal of knowledge that even my teachers didn&#x27;t have about wars and politics.&quot;

After a series of bank failures devastated the economy of the upper Midwest, Dr. LaMoore and Emily took to the road. Removing Louis and his adopted brother John from school, they headed south in the winter of 1923. Over the next seven or eight years, they skinned cattle in west Texas, baled hay in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico, worked in the mines of Arizona, California and Nevada, and in the sawmills and lumber camps of the Pacific Northwest. It was in colorful places like these that Louis met a wide variety of people, upon whom he later modeled the characters in his novels, many of them actual Old West personalities who had survived into the 1920s and 1930s.

Making his way as a mine assessment worker, professional boxer, and merchant seaman, Louis traveled the country and the world, sometimes with his family, sometimes not. He visited all of the western states plus England, Japan, China, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies, Arabia, Egypt, and Panama, finally moving with his parents to Choctaw, Oklahoma in the early 1930s. There, he changed his name to the original French spelling &quot;L&#x27;Amour&quot; and settled down to try to make something of himself as a writer.

=== Early works ===
He had success with poetry, articles on boxing and writing and editing sections of the WPA Guide Book to Oklahoma, but the dozens of short stories he was churning out met with little acceptance. Finally, L&#x27;Amour placed a story, &quot;Death Westbound&quot;, in &quot;10 Story Book&quot;, a magazine that featured what was supposed to be quality writing (Jack Woodford, author of several books on writing, is published in the same edition as L&#x27;Amour) alongside scantily attired or completely naked young women. Several years later, L&#x27;Amour placed his first story for pay, &quot;Anything for a Pal&quot;, published in &quot;True Gang Life&quot;. Two lean disappointing years passed after that, and then, in 1938, his stories began appearing in pulp magazines fairly regularly.

Along with other adventure and crime stories, L&#x27;Amour created the character of mercenary sea captain Jim Mayo. Starting with &quot;East of Gorontalo&quot;, the series ran through nine episodes from 1940 until 1943. L&#x27;Amour wrote only one story in the western genre prior to World War II, 1940&#x27;s &quot;The Town No Guns Could Tame&quot;.

=== World War II service and post-war ===

L&#x27;Amour continued as an itinerant worker, traveling the world as a merchant seaman until the start of World War II. During World War II, he served in the United States Army as a lieutenant with the 362nd Quartermaster Truck Company. In the two years before L&#x27;Amour was shipped off to Europe, L&#x27;Amour wrote stories for &quot;Standard Magazine&quot;. After World War II, L&#x27;Amour continued to write stories for magazines; his first after being discharged in 1946 was &quot;Law of the Desert Born&quot; in &quot;Dime Western Magazine&quot; (April 1946). L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s contact with Leo Margulies led to L&#x27;Amour agreeing to write many stories for the Western pulp magazines published by Standard Magazines, a substantial portion of which appeared under the name &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;. The suggestion of L&#x27;Amour writing Hopalong Cassidy novels also was made by Margulies who planned on launching &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&#x27;s Western Magazine&quot; at a time when the William Boyd films and new television series were becoming popular with a new generation. L&#x27;Amour read the original Hopalong Cassidy novels, written by Clarence E. Mulford, and wrote his novels based on the original character under the name &quot;Tex Burns&quot;. Only two issues of the &quot;Hopalong Cassidy Western Magazine&quot; were published, and the novels as written by L&#x27;Amour were extensively edited to meet Doubleday&#x27;s thoughts of how the character should be portrayed in print. Strongly disagreeing—L&#x27;Amour preferred Mulford&#x27;s original, much rougher characterization of Cassidy—for the rest of his life he denied authoring the novels.

In the 1950s, L&#x27;Amour began to sell novels. L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s first novel, published under his own name, was &quot;Westward The Tide&quot;, published by World&#x27;s Work in 1951. The short story &quot;The Gift of Cochise&quot; was printed in &quot;Colliers&quot; (5 July 1952) and seen by John Wayne and Robert Fellows, who purchased the screen rights from L&#x27;Amour for $4,000. James Edward Grant was hired to write a screenplay based on this story changing the main character&#x27;s name from Ches Lane to Hondo Lane. L&#x27;Amour retained the right to novelize the screenplay and did so, even though the screenplay differed substantially from the original story. This was published as &quot;Hondo&quot; in 1953 and released on the same day the film opened with a blurb from John Wayne stating that &quot;&quot;Hondo&quot; was the finest Western Wayne had ever read&quot;. During the remainder of the decade L&#x27;Amour produced a great number of novels, both under his own name as well as others (e. g. Jim Mayo). Also during this time he rewrote and expanded many of his earlier short story and pulp fiction stories to book length for various publishers.

=== Bantam Books ===

Many publishers in the 1950s and &#x27;60s refused to publish more than one or two books a year by the same author. Louis&#x27;s editor at Gold Medal supported his writing up to three or four but the heads of the company vetoed that idea even though Louis was publishing books with other houses. Louis had sold over a dozen novels and several million copies before Bantam Books editor-in-chief Saul David was finally able to convince his company to offer Louis a short term exclusive contract that would accept three books a year. It was only after 1960, however, that Louis&#x27;s sales at Bantam would begin to surpass his sales at Gold Medal.

L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s career flourished throughout the 1960s and he began work on a series of novels about the fictional Sackett family. &quot;The Daybreakers&quot;, published in 1960 and the first, was actually not in the chronological order of the series of novels. Initially he wrote five books about William Tell Sackett and his close relatives; however, in later years the series spread to include other families and four centuries of North American history. It was an ambitious project and several stories intended to close the gaps in the family&#x27;s time line were left untold at the time of L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s death. L&#x27;Amour also branched out into historical fiction with &quot;The Walking Drum&quot;, set in the 11th century, a contemporary thriller, &quot;Last of the Breed&quot;, and science fiction with &quot;The Haunted Mesa&quot;.

L&#x27;Amour eventually wrote 100 novels, over 250 short stories, and (as of 2010) sold more than 320 million copies of his work. By the 1970s his writings were translated into over ten languages. Every one of his works is still in print.

==Audio book publishing==
Many of the L&#x27;Amour titles have been produced in the &quot;single voice&quot; style. In the early days, however, when the fledgling Bantam Audio Publishing (now Random House Audio) came to L&#x27;Amour about converting some of his old short stories into audio, he insisted that they do something to offer the audience more value than just having an actor read a bunch of old pulp stories. Together he and Bantam executive Jenny Frost created the concept of a series of &quot;Radio Drama&quot; style productions that would combine a large cast of actors, sound effects and music to produce a modern audio drama of each story.

The team of David Rapkin (Producer) and Charles Potter (Director) was employed to produce a prototype show and L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s son Beau came into the program as Supervising Producer. Between 1986 and 2004 the team had completed over sixty-five dramatized audio productions. Several different styles of show were produced over the years. The first several shows were &quot;transcriptions&quot;, literal breakdowns of the exact L&#x27;Amour short story into lines for the different characters and narrator. Later productions used more liberally interpreted adaptations written by screenwriters, playwrights and a few film and theater students, who were taught the process by Beau L&#x27;Amour and the more prolific writers from earlier adaptations.

The majority of productions were done in New York City. In the early years the pace of production was six shows a year but in the mid-1990s it slowed to four. At this time the running time for all the programs was roughly sixty minutes. The cast members were veterans of the New York stage, film and advertising worlds and came together for a rehearsal and then a day of recording the show. Sound effects were created by effects man Arthur Miller in the studio as the lines were being recorded and narration was done.

Although many of the programs were written and produced in a modified &quot;Old Time Radio&quot; style, attempts were also made to modernize the approach. Whenever the story material supported it a more contemporary style was used in the writing and more and more high tech solutions to the effects and mix found their way into the productions. While hiring and supervising the writers, mostly out of Los Angeles, Beau L&#x27;Amour created a few programs on his own. The techniques used by him and producer/editor Paul O&#x27;Dell were more in line with motion picture production, simply taping the voices of the actors in the studio and then recording the majority of sound effects in the field. This called for a great deal more editing, both in cutting the actor&#x27;s performances and the sound effects, but it allowed for a great deal more control.

In the mid-1990s a series of the L&#x27;Amour Audio Dramas was recut for radio. Louis L&#x27;Amour Theater played on over two hundred stations for a number of years. Several of the scripts from the L&#x27;Amour series have been produced as live theater pieces, including &quot;The One for the Mojave Kid&quot; and &quot;Merrano of the Dry Country&quot;.

The L&#x27;Amour program of Audio Dramas is still ongoing but the pace of production has slowed considerably. Beau L&#x27;Amour and Paul O&#x27;Dell released &quot;Son of a Wanted Man&quot;, the first L&#x27;Amour Drama in half a decade in 2004. &quot;Son of a Wanted Man&quot; is also the first Louis L&#x27;Amour novel to be turned into a drama. Considerably more complex than earlier shows it had a cast of over twenty mid-level Hollywood actors, a music score was created by John Philip Shenale and recorded specifically for the production and sound effects completely recorded in the field in many locations across the west. Produced as sort of a &quot;profitable hobby&quot; Beau L&#x27;Amour and Paul O&#x27;Dell created the production while working around their day-to-day jobs. Since this allowed them no more than nine or ten weeks a year, the show took four years to complete.

==Shalako==
During the 1960s, L&#x27;Amour intended to build a working town typical of those of the 19th century Western frontier, with buildings with false fronts situated in rows on either side of an unpaved main street and flanked by wide boardwalks before which, at various intervals, were watering troughs and hitching posts. The town, to be named Shalako after the protagonist of L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s novel of the same name, was to have featured shops and other businesses that were typical of such towns: a barber shop, a hotel, a dry goods store, one or more saloons, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, etc. It would have offered itself as a filming location for Hollywood motion pictures concerning the Wild West. However, funding for the project fell through, and Shalako was never built.

==Literary assessment==
When interviewed not long before his death, he was asked which among his books he liked best. His reply:

I like them all. There&#x27;s bits and pieces of books that I think are good. I never rework a book. I&#x27;d rather use what I&#x27;ve learned on the next one, and make it a little bit better. The worst of it is that I&#x27;m no longer a kid and I&#x27;m just now getting to be a good writer. Just now.

The critic Jon Tuska, surveying Western literature, writes:

I have no argument that L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s total sales have probably surpassed every other author of Western fiction in the history of the genre. Indeed, at the time of his death his sales had topped 200,000,000. What I would question is the degree and extent of his effect &quot;upon the American Imagination&quot;. His Western fiction is strictly formulary and frequently, although not always, features the ranch romance plot where the hero and the heroine are to marry at the end once the villains have been defeated. Not only is there nothing really new in the basic structure of his stories, even L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s social Darwinism, which came to characterize his later fiction, was scarcely original and was never dramatized in other media the way it was in works based on Zane Grey&#x27;s fiction.

But Tuska also notes &quot;At his best, L&#x27;Amour was a master of spectacular action and stories with a vivid, propulsive forward motion.&quot;

==Awards==
In May 1972 he was awarded an Honorary PhD by Jamestown College, as a testament to his literary and social contributions.

In 1979, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

&quot;Bendigo Shafter&quot; (1979) won the U.S. National Book Award in the one-year category Western.

In 1982 he received the Congressional Gold Medal, and in 1984 President Ronald Reagan awarded L&#x27;Amour the Presidential Medal of Freedom. L&#x27;Amour is also a recipient of North Dakota&#x27;s Roughrider Award and the MPTF Golden Boot Award.

==Death==

L&#x27;Amour, a non-smoker, died from lung cancer at his home in Los Angeles on June 10, 1988, and was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. His autobiography detailing his years as an itinerant worker in the west, &quot;Education of a Wandering Man&quot;, was published posthumously in 1989. He was survived by his wife Kathy, their son Beau, and their daughter Angelique.

===Hopalong Cassidy series===
Originally published under the pseudonym &quot;Tex Burns&quot;. Louis L&#x27;Amour was commissioned to write four Hopalong Cassidy books in the spring and summer of 1950 by Doubleday&#x27;s Double D Western imprint. They were the first novels he ever had published and he denied writing them until the day he died, refusing to sign any of them that fans would occasionally bring to his autograph sessions. The reason given to his young son for doing this was, &quot;I wrote some books. I just did it for the money, and my name didn&#x27;t go on them. So now, when people ask me if they were mine, I say &#x27;no.&#x27;&quot; When his son asked if this would be a lie, he said, &quot;I just wrote them for hire. They weren&#x27;t my books.&quot;

<text>Jerome Leon Bruckheimer (born September 21, 1943) is an American film and television producer. He has been active in the genres of action, drama, comedy, fantasy, horror and science fiction. After working in advertising out of college, Bruckheimer moved into film production in the 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, he partnered with fellow producer Don Simpson. Bruckheimer and Simpson&#x27;s partnership continued until Simpson&#x27;s death in 1996. Bruckheimer has produced films including &quot;Flashdance&quot;, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, &quot;The Rock&quot;, &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, &quot;Con Air&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, as well as the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; and &quot;National Treasure&quot; franchises. 

At the helm of his self-titled production company, he has produced films that have been distributed by numerous film studios such as Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures and Disney, while his television works have been co-produced by Warner Bros. Television and CBS Studios. In July 2003, Bruckheimer was honored by &quot;Variety&quot; as the first in Hollywood history to produce the first and second highest-grossing films of a single weekend: &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; and &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; earned him his first nomination for Best Picture at the 95th Academy Awards.

His best known television series are television dramas &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Lucifer&quot; and reality competition series &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, which would spawn a franchise with international versions. For the latter, he won ten Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2003, three of his television productions—&quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot; and &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;—ranked among the top ten in the US ratings, making him the first producer to achieve this.

Bruckheimer is also the co-founder (with the late David Bonderman) and majority owner of the Seattle Kraken, the 2021 expansion team of the National Hockey League.

== Early life ==

Bruckheimer was born on September 21, 1943, in Detroit, Michigan, the son of German Jewish immigrants. He graduated from Mumford High School in 1961 in Detroit, at age 17, before moving to Arizona for college. Bruckheimer was also an active member of the Stamp Collecting Club. He graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Arizona. He was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. A film buff at an early age with an interest in photography, Bruckheimer would take snapshots when he had the opportunity. After college, Bruckheimer worked in advertising in Detroit (creative producer) and New York City. At the Detroit agency he worked on a one minute ad spot for the new Pontiac GTO. Early in his career, Bruckheimer produced television commercials, including one for Pepsi.

==Career==
=== 1970s &amp; 1980s: From advertising to film production ===
Bruckheimer started producing films in the 1970s after leaving his job in advertising, with director Dick Richards. They worked together on the films &quot;The Culpepper Cattle Company&quot;, &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; and &quot;March or Die&quot;. Bruckheimer then worked with Paul Schrader on two films, &quot;American Gigolo&quot; and &quot;Cat People&quot;, which began to attract notice for him in Hollywood.

During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a co-producer with Don Simpson of a string of highly successful films for Paramount Pictures. He first met Simpson at a screening of 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; at Warner Brothers. The two worked together and created Bruckheimer&#x27;s first big hit, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Flashdance&quot;, which brought in . He had a number of other hits during that time period, including the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; films, &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;. &quot;Top Gun&quot; marked his first collaboration with English director Tony Scott, who directed six films for Bruckheimer. The first &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; movie, which was supposed to star Sylvester Stallone, launched Eddie Murphy&#x27;s career and in just five days, became the highest grossing winter release in Paramount&#x27;s history. On August 9, 1983, Bruckheimer and Simpson struck a three-year agreement with Paramount to produce theatrical and television projects through his new Simpson/Bruckheimer Productions company.

While working with Simpson, Bruckheimer became known as &quot;Mr. Outside&quot; because of his experience with filmmaking, while Simpson became known as &quot;Mr. Inside&quot; because of his film industry contacts. &quot;The Rock&quot; was the last film in which Bruckheimer collaborated with Simpson. After Simpson&#x27;s death in 1996, Bruckheimer stipulated that &quot;The Rock&quot; be dedicated to the memory of Simpson.

=== 1990s: Big-budget films ===

In 1990, Bruckheimer and Simpson struck a deal with Paramount to produce five movies, entirely of their choice. However, his 1990 production of the film &quot;Days of Thunder,&quot; which starred Tom Cruise, did not perform as well as expected, which was a step backwards in the Bruckheimer-Simpson success story. The duo made a come-back in 1994, however, with the low-budget film () &quot;The Ref&quot;.

Despite Simpson&#x27;s untimely death, Bruckheimer continued to produce a large number of action films, often working with director Michael Bay on several box office hits, including &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Other popular films he produced include &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; and the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series. Bruckheimer has also acquired the rights to produce a film based on the popular role playing game by Palladium Books, &quot;Rifts&quot;. In the late 1990s, he started Technical Black Films to produce non-action films, with &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; being the only film produced.

=== 2000s: Franchises, TV, video games ===

Since 1996, Bruckheimer has branched out into television, creating a number of police dramas of which &quot;&quot; has been the most notable on daytime television. He also produced the reality game show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. In May 2008, CBS announced it had picked up Bruckheimer&#x27;s newest series, &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot;, for the 2008–2009 broadcast television season. The science fiction drama follows a government agent and a professor as they investigate strange scientific and medical activity.

From 2004 (beginning of &quot;&quot;) to 2009 (end of &quot;Without a Trace&quot;), Bruckheimer had six hit television shows on the air: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;CSI: NY&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. At one point, three of his TV series ranked among the top 10 in the ratings.

In December 2007, Bruckheimer announced plans to partner with MTV to create a new game studio. The same year, Bruckheimer joined the ZeniMax Media board of directors and has since showed up at several launch parties for Bethesda Softworks titles, including &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;. In 2009, Bruckheimer unveiled Jerry Bruckheimer Games, headed by former Microsoft Studios Publishing Executive Producer Jim Veevaert, as President of Production, and Jay Cohen, previously Ubisoft&#x27;s Vice President of US Publishing, as President of Development.

It was announced on September 10, 2009, that NBC had picked up an action procedural from Bruckheimer. The show, titled &quot;Chase&quot;, &quot;tells the stories of a team charged with making sure fugitive criminals don&#x27;t evade justice,&quot; reports &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. It was canceled in May 2011, however. &quot;Skin&quot;, which was another Bruckheiner production, was cancelled in 2003, after only three episodes.

=== 2010s: Independent producer, sports ===
In 2011, it was rumored that Jerry Bruckheimer Games was working on three titles, but nothing came to fruition. In March 2013, Jerry Bruckheimer Games was closed. Although Jerry Bruckheimer Games is closed, Bruckheimer still remained a ZeniMax Board Member, mostly due to being a close associate of former ZeniMax President Ernest Del, until ZeniMax was purchased by Microsoft in 2021.
In 2014, after the disappointment of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, Bruckheimer and the Disney Studios chose to part ways by not renewing their first-look deal that expired that year. He signed a new first-look deal with Paramount that same year and mentioned a new &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and a &quot;Top Gun 2&quot; as potential production ventures with his new partner.

In June 2016, Jerry Bruckheimer Television became an independent outfit, ending a 15-year run exclusive pact with Warner Bros Television. The next year, the production company signed a deal with CBS Television Studios.

Bruckheimer was named as one of the investors of a proposed sports arena in Las Vegas, and he had been rumored to be the leading choice by the National Hockey League (NHL) to own an expansion hockey team that would play in the arena. Bruckheimer was also named as one of the investors of a proposed Seattle-based NHL expansion team, whose application was submitted in early 2018. The NHL Board of Governors voted to approve the team, named the Seattle Kraken, on December 4, 2018, which started to play in the 2021–22 season. Bruckheimer was part of an investment group that also included Tim Leiweke (Oak View Group) and David Bonderman (minority owner NBA&#x27;s Boston Celtics). In 2020, it was reported that his first look deal with Paramount was not renewed.

== Impact on the film industry ==
=== High-profit productions ===

The movie &quot;Top Gun&quot; was produced in collaboration with the Pentagon to rebrand the US Navy&#x27;s image after the Vietnam War and attract new Navy recruits. &quot;Top Gun&quot; was the first full-blown collaboration between Hollywood and the Navy. The model, which was developed by Bruckheimer, launched a new trend of military movies in the 1990s and onward.

In July 2003, Bruckheimer was honored by &quot;Variety&quot; as the first producer in Hollywood history to produce the top two highest-grossing films of a single weekend, the buddy-cop &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; and the Disney theme-park spin-off, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the &quot;Bruckheimer touch&quot; is characterized by a &quot;consistently edgy, high-octane visual dynamic and equally distinctive storytelling driven by the triumphalism so popular with Madison Avenue&quot;.

The &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series, produced through Walt Disney Pictures, was enormously profitable and demonstrated Bruckheimer&#x27;s ability to create lucrative projects. &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, which was the first film in the franchise, was released on July 9, 2003. A box office hit, the film was well received by both critics and filmgoers. After the unexpected success of the first film, Disney revealed that a trilogy was in the works. &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; was released on July 7, 2006. The sequel proved to be very successful, breaking records worldwide on the day of its premiere. In the end, the film acquired a total of at the worldwide box office, becoming the third and fastest film to reach this amount. The third film in the series, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, was released worldwide on May 25, 2007. Two more films, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, were released, in 2011 and 2017, respectively. Altogether, the film franchise has grossed over worldwide.

=== Views on moviemaking ===

When asked on what the film industry&#x27;s obligation to an audience was, he responded, &quot;We are in the transportation business. We transport audiences from one place to another.&quot; When asked why he makes films, he stated, &quot;If I made films for the critics, or for someone else, I&#x27;d probably be living in some small Hollywood studio apartment.&quot;

In a 1984 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Bruckheimer said, &quot;We [he and Don Simpson] put together all the elements. We decide what aesthetic is right for a picture. We are as much a part of the process as the director.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bruckheimer has been married twice. His first wife was Bonnie Fishman Bruckheimer from 1969 until 1974. He resides in Los Angeles with his second wife, novelist Linda Cobb Bruckheimer who he married in 1993. He has one stepdaughter, Alexandra. The couple own a farm in Bloomfield, Kentucky, about southeast of Louisville, as well as another in Ojai, east of Santa Barbara.

When asked about his favorite films, Bruckheimer named &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997) and &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959).

In May 2006, he was honored with a Doctorate of Fine Arts degree (DFA) from the University of Arizona&#x27;s College of Fine Arts.

=== Philanthropic activities ===
Bruckheimer&#x27;s philanthropic activities have included publicly supporting the fight against multiple sclerosis via his work with The Nancy Davis Foundation for MS. Additionally, throughout his career, he has pledged to help various causes by establishing the Jerry Bruckheimer Foundation. According to The Smoking Gun, however, the last time the Jerry Bruckheimer Foundation made a contribution was in 1995, when it gave to Van Nuys Prep School.

Bruckheimer has aided in the repair and restoration of the historic clipper ship, &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;. A collection of photos taken by Bruckheimer went on display in London in November 2007 to help raise money for the Cutty Sark Conservation Project. The exhibition featured more than thirty pictures taken on set during the filming of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;.

=== Political contributions ===
Bruckheimer has donated more than to Republican campaigns and committees. He donated funds to John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential election campaign. He gave to a joint fundraising committee on John McCain&#x27;s behalf. He donated to the 2012 Mitt Romney Victory Fund.

<text>SSE2 (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2) is one of the Intel SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) processor supplementary instruction sets introduced by Intel with the initial version of the Pentium 4 in 2000. SSE2 instructions allow the use of XMM (SIMD) registers on x86 instruction set architecture processors. These registers can load up to 128 bits of data and perform instructions, such as vector addition and multiplication, simultaneously. 

SSE2 introduced double-precision floating point instructions in addition to the single-precision floating point and integer instructions found in SSE. SSE2 extends earlier SSE instruction set by adding 144 new instructions to the previous 70 instructions. SSE2 intends to fully replace MMX, a SIMD instruction set found on IA-32 architecture processors. Competing chip-maker AMD added support for SSE2 with the introduction of their Opteron and Athlon 64 ranges of AMD64 64-bit CPUs in 2003.

SSE2 was extended to create SSE3 in 2004, and extended once again to create SSE4 in 2006.

==Features==
Most of the SSE2 instructions implement the integer vector operations also found in MMX. Instead of the MMX registers they use the XMM registers, which are wider and allow for significant performance improvements in specialized applications. Another advantage of replacing MMX with SSE2 is avoiding the mode switching penalty for issuing x87 instructions present in MMX because it is sharing register space with the x87 FPU. The SSE2 also complements the floating-point vector operations of the SSE instruction set by adding support for the double precision data type.

Other SSE2 extensions include a set of cache control instructions intended primarily to minimize cache pollution when processing infinite streams of information, and a sophisticated complement of numeric format conversion instructions.

AMD&#x27;s implementation of SSE2 on the AMD64 (x86-64) platform includes an additional eight registers, doubling the total number to 16 (XMM0 through XMM15). These additional registers are only visible when running in 64-bit mode. Intel adopted these additional registers as part of their support for x86-64 architecture (or in Intel&#x27;s parlance, &quot;Intel 64&quot;) in 2004.

==Differences between x87 FPU and SSE2==
FPU (x87) instructions provide higher precision by calculating intermediate results with 80 bits of precision, by default, to minimise roundoff error in numerically unstable algorithms (see IEEE 754 design rationale and references therein). However, the x87 FPU is a scalar unit only whereas SSE2 can process a small vector of operands in parallel.

If code designed for x87 is ported to the lower precision double precision SSE2 floating point, certain combinations of math operations or input datasets can result in measurable numerical deviation, which can be an issue in reproducible scientific computations, e.g. if the calculation results must be compared against results generated from a different machine architecture. A related issue is that, historically, language standards and compilers had been inconsistent in their handling of the x87 80-bit registers implementing double extended precision variables, compared with the double and single precision formats implemented in SSE2: the rounding of extended precision intermediate values to double precision variables was not fully defined and was dependent on implementation details such as when registers were spilled to memory.

==Differences between MMX and SSE2==
SSE2 extends MMX instructions to operate on XMM registers. Therefore, it is possible to convert all existing MMX code to an SSE2 equivalent. Since an SSE2 register is twice as long as an MMX register, loop counters and memory access may need to be changed to accommodate this. However, 8 byte loads and stores to XMM are available, so this is not strictly required.

Although one SSE2 instruction can operate on twice as much data as an MMX instruction, performance might not increase significantly. Two major reasons are: accessing SSE2 data in memory not aligned to a 16-byte boundary can incur significant penalty, and the throughput of SSE2 instructions in older x86 implementations was half that for MMX instructions. Intel addressed the first problem by adding an instruction in SSE3 to reduce the overhead of accessing unaligned data and improving the overall performance of misaligned loads, and the last problem by widening the execution engine in their Core microarchitecture in Core 2 Duo and later products.

Since MMX and x87 register files alias one another, using MMX will prevent x87 instructions from working as desired. Once MMX has been used, the programmer must use the emms instruction (C: _mm_empty()) to restore operation to the x87 register file. On some operating systems, x87 is not used very much, but may still be used in some critical areas like pow() where the extra precision is needed. In such cases, the corrupt floating-point state caused by failure to emit emms may go undetected for millions of instructions before ultimately causing the floating-point routine to fail, returning NaN. Since the problem is not locally apparent in the MMX code, finding and correcting the bug can be very time consuming. As SSE2 does not have this problem and it usually provides much better throughput and provides more registers in 64-bit code, it should be preferred for nearly all vectorization work.

==Compiler usage==
When introduced in 2000, SSE2 was not supported by software development tools. For example, to use SSE2 in a Microsoft Visual Studio project, the programmer had to either manually write inline-assembly or import object-code from an external source. Later the Visual C++ Processor Pack added SSE2 support to Visual C++ and MASM.

The Intel C++ Compiler can automatically generate SSE4, SSSE3, SSE3, SSE2, and SSE code without the use of hand-coded assembly.

Since GCC 3, GCC can automatically generate SSE/SSE2 scalar code when the target supports those instructions. Automatic vectorization for SSE/SSE2 has been added since GCC 4.

The Sun Studio Compiler Suite can also generate SSE2 instructions when the compiler flag -xvector=simd is used.

Since Microsoft Visual C++ 2012, the compiler option to generate SSE2 instructions is turned on by default.

==CPU support==
SSE2 is an extension of the IA-32 architecture, based on the x86 instruction set. Therefore, only x86 processors can include SSE2. The AMD64 architecture supports the IA-32 as a compatibility mode and includes the SSE2 in its specification. It also doubles the number of XMM registers, allowing for better performance. SSE2 is also a requirement for installing Windows 8 (and later) or Microsoft Office 2013 (and later) &quot;to enhance the reliability of third-party apps and drivers running in Windows 8&quot;.

The following IA-32 CPUs support SSE2:

* Intel NetBurst-based CPUs (Pentium 4, Xeon, Celeron, Pentium D, Celeron D)
* Intel Pentium M and Celeron M
* Intel Atom
* AMD Athlon 64
* Transmeta Efficeon
* VIA C7

The following IA-32 CPUs were released after SSE2 was developed, but did not implement it:

* AMD CPUs prior to Athlon 64, such as Athlon XP
* VIA C3
* Transmeta Crusoe
* Intel Quark

<text>May 68 () refers to a period of civil unrest that occurred throughout France from May to June 1968. Beginning in May 1968, a period of civil unrest occurred throughout France, lasting seven weeks and punctuated by demonstrations, general strikes, and the occupation of universities and factories. At the height of events the economy of France came to a halt. The protests reached a point that made political leaders fear civil war or revolution; the national government briefly ceased to function after President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled France to West Germany on the 29th. The protests are sometimes linked to similar movements around the same time worldwide that inspired a generation of protest art in the form of songs, imaginative graffiti, posters, and slogans.

The unrest began with a series of far-left student occupation protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism and traditional institutions. Heavy police repression of the protesters led France&#x27;s trade union confederations to call for sympathy strikes, which spread far more quickly than expected to involve 11 million workers, more than 22% of France&#x27;s population at the time. The movement was characterized by spontaneous and decentralized wildcat disposition; this created contrast and at times even conflict among the trade unions and leftist parties. It was the largest general strike ever attempted in France, and the first nationwide wildcat general strike.

The student occupations and general strikes across France met with forceful confrontation by university administrators and police. The de Gaulle administration&#x27;s attempts to quell the strikes by police action only inflamed the situation, leading to street battles with the police in Paris&#x27;s Latin Quarter.

By late May the flow of events had changed. The Grenelle accords, concluded on 27 May between the government, trade unions and employers, won significant wage gains for workers. A counter-demonstration organized by the Gaullist party on 29 May in central Paris gave De Gaulle the confidence to dissolve the National Assembly and call parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968. Violence evaporated almost as quickly as it had arisen. Workers returned to their jobs, and after the June elections, the Gaullists emerged stronger than before.

The events of May 1968 continue to influence French society. The period is considered a cultural, social and moral turning point in the nation&#x27;s history. Alain Geismar, who was one of the student leaders at the time, later said the movement had succeeded &quot;as a social revolution, not as a political one&quot;.

==Background==
===Political climate===
In February 1968, the French Communist Party and the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International formed an electoral alliance. Communists had long supported Socialist candidates in elections, but in the &quot;February Declaration&quot; the two parties agreed to attempt to form a joint government to replace President Charles de Gaulle and his Gaullist Party.

===University demonstration===
On 22 March, far-left groups, a small number of prominent poets and musicians, and 150 students occupied an administration building at Paris University at Nanterre and held a meeting in the university council room about class discrimination in French society and the political bureaucracy that controlled the university&#x27;s funding. The university&#x27;s administration called the police, who surrounded the university. After the publication of their wishes, the students left the building without any trouble. After this, some leaders of what was named the &quot;Movement of 22 March&quot; were called together by the disciplinary committee of the university.

==Events of May==
===Student protests===
After months of conflicts between students and authorities at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris (now Paris Nanterre University), the administration shut the university down on 2 May 1968. Students at the University of Paris&#x27;s Sorbonne campus (today Sorbonne University) met on 3 May to protest the closure and the threatened expulsion of several Nanterre students. On 6 May, the national student union, the Union Nationale des Étudiants de France (UNEF, the National Union of Students of France)—still France&#x27;s largest student union today—and the union of university teachers called a march to protest the police invasion of the Sorbonne. More than 20,000 students, teachers and supporters marched toward the Sorbonne, still sealed off by the police, who charged, wielding their batons, as soon as the marchers approached. While the crowd dispersed, some began to create barricades out of whatever was at hand, while others threw paving stones, forcing the police to retreat for a time. The police then responded with tear gas and charged the crowd again. Hundreds more students were arrested.

High school student unions spoke in support of the riots on 6 May. The next day, they joined the students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers who gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that (1) all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, (2) the police leave the university, and (3) the authorities reopen Nanterre and Sorbonne.

===Escalating conflict===
Negotiations broke down, and students returned to their campuses after a false report that the government had agreed to reopen them, only to discover the police still occupying the schools. This led to near revolutionary fervor among the students.

On 10 May, another huge crowd congregated on the Rive Gauche. When the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité again blocked them from crossing the river, the crowd again threw up barricades, which the police then attacked at 2:15 a.m. after negotiations once again floundered. The confrontation, which produced hundreds of arrests and injuries, lasted until dawn. The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred and the aftermath shown on television the next day. It was alleged that the police had participated in the riots, through &quot;agents provocateurs&quot;, by burning cars and throwing Molotov cocktails.

The government&#x27;s heavy-handed reaction brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Many of the nation&#x27;s more mainstream singers and poets joined after the police brutality came to light. American artists also began voicing support of the strikers. The major left union federations, the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) and the Force Ouvrière (CGT-FO), called a one-day general strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May.

Well over a million people marched through Paris that day; the police stayed largely out of sight. Prime Minister Georges Pompidou personally announced the release of the prisoners and the reopening of the Sorbonne. However, the surge of strikes did not recede. Instead, the protesters became even more active.

When the Sorbonne reopened, students occupied it and declared it an autonomous &quot;people&#x27;s university&quot;. Public opinion at first supported the students, but turned against them after their leaders, invited to appear on national television, &quot;behaved like irresponsible utopianists who wanted to destroy the &#x27;consumer society. Nonetheless, in the weeks that followed, approximately 401 popular action committees were set up in Paris and elsewhere to take up grievances against the government and French society, including the Sorbonne Occupation Committee.

===Worker strikes===

By the middle of May, demonstrations extended to factories, though workers&#x27; demands significantly varied from students&#x27;. A union-led general strike on 13 May included 200,000 in a march. The strikes spread to all sectors of the French economy, including state-owned jobs, manufacturing and service industries, management, and administration. Across France, students occupied university structures and up to one-third of the country&#x27;s workforce was on strike.

On 24 May, two people died at the hands of rioters. In Lyon, Police Inspector Rene Lacroix died when he was crushed by a driverless truck rioters sent careering into police lines. In Paris, Phillipe Metherion, 26, was stabbed to death during an argument among demonstrators.

As the upheaval reached its apogee in late May, major trade unions met with employers&#x27; organizations and the French government to produce the Grenelle agreements, which would increase the minimum wage 35% and all salaries 10%, and granted employee protections and a shortened working day. The unions were forced to reject the agreement, based on opposition from their members, underscoring a disconnect in organizations that claimed to reflect working class interests.

The UNEF student union and CFDT trade union held a rally in the Charléty stadium with about 22,000 attendees. Its range of speakers reflected the divide between student and Communist factions. While the rally was held in the stadium partly for security, the speakers&#x27; insurrectionist messages were dissonant with the relative amenities of the sports venue.

===Calls for new government===
The Socialists saw an opportunity to act as a compromise between de Gaulle and the Communists. On 28 May, François Mitterrand of the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left declared that &quot;there is no more state&quot; and said he was ready to form a new government. He had received a surprisingly high 45% of the vote in the 1965 presidential election. On 29 May, Pierre Mendès France also said he was ready to form a new government; unlike Mitterrand, he was willing to include the Communists. Although the Socialists lacked the Communists&#x27; ability to form large street demonstrations, they had more than 20% of the country&#x27;s support.

===De Gaulle flees===
On the morning of 29 May, de Gaulle postponed the meeting of the Council of Ministers scheduled for that day and secretly removed his personal papers from Élysée Palace. He told his son-in-law Alain de Boissieu: &quot;I do not want to give them a chance to attack the Élysée. It would be regrettable if blood were shed in my personal defense. I have decided to leave: nobody attacks an empty palace.&quot; De Gaulle refused Pompidou&#x27;s request that he dissolve the National Assembly, as he believed that their party, the Gaullists, would lose the resulting election. At 11:00 am, he told Pompidou, &quot;I am the past; you are the future; I embrace you.&quot;

The government announced that de Gaulle was going to his country home in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises before returning the next day, and rumors spread that he would prepare his resignation speech there. However, the presidential helicopter did not arrive in Colombey, and de Gaulle had told no one in the government where he was going. For more than six hours the world did not know where he was. The canceling of the ministerial meeting and de Gaulle&#x27;s mysterious disappearance stunned the French, including Pompidou, who shouted, &quot;He has fled the country!&quot;

=== Government collapse ===
With de Gaulle&#x27;s closest advisors saying they did not know what he intended, Pompidou scheduled a tentative appearance on television at 8 p.m. The national government had effectively ceased to function. Édouard Balladur later wrote that as prime minister, Pompidou &quot;by himself was the whole government&quot;, as most officials were &quot;an incoherent group of confabulators&quot; who believed that revolution would soon occur. A friend of Pompidou offered him a weapon, saying, &quot;You will need it&quot;; Pompidou advised him to go home. One official reportedly began burning documents, while another asked an aide how far they could flee by automobile should revolutionaries seize fuel supplies. Withdrawing money from banks became difficult, gasoline for private automobiles was unavailable, and some people tried to obtain private planes or fake national identity cards.

Pompidou unsuccessfully requested that military radar be used to follow de Gaulle&#x27;s two helicopters, but soon learned that he had gone to the headquarters of the French Forces in Germany, in Baden-Baden, to meet General Jacques Massu. Massu persuaded the discouraged de Gaulle to return to France; now knowing that he had the military&#x27;s support, de Gaulle rescheduled the meeting of the Council of Ministers for the next day, 30 May, and returned to Colombey by 6:00 pm. However, his wife Yvonne gave the family jewels to their son and daughter-in-law—who stayed in Baden for a few more days—for safekeeping, indicating that the de Gaulles still considered Germany a possible refuge. Massu kept as a state secret de Gaulle&#x27;s loss of confidence until others disclosed it in 1982; until then most observers believed that his disappearance was intended to remind the French people of what they might lose. Although the disappearance was real and not intended as motivation, it indeed had such an effect on France.

===Revolution prevented===
On 30 May, 400,000 to 500,000 protesters (many more than the 50,000 the police were expecting) led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting: &quot;Adieu, de Gaulle!&quot; (&quot;Farewell, de Gaulle!&quot;). Maurice Grimaud, head of the Paris police, played a key role in avoiding revolution by both speaking to and spying on the revolutionaries, and by avoiding the use of force. While Communist leaders later denied that they had planned an armed uprising, and extreme militants only comprised 2% of the populace, they had overestimated de Gaulle&#x27;s strength, as shown by his escape to Germany. Historian Arthur P. Mendel, otherwise skeptical of French Communists&#x27; willingness to maintain democracy after forming a government, claims that the &quot;moderate, nonviolent and essentially antirevolutionary&quot; Communists opposed revolution because they sincerely believed that the party must come to power through legal elections, not armed conflict that might provoke harsh repression from political opponents.

Not knowing that the Communists did not intend to seize power, officials prepared to position police forces at the Élysée with orders to shoot if necessary. That it did not also guard Paris City Hall despite reports that it was the Communists&#x27; target was evidence of governmental chaos. The Communist movement largely centered around the Paris metropolitan area, and not elsewhere. Had the rebellion occupied key public buildings in Paris, the government would have had to use force to retake them. The resulting casualties could have incited a revolution, with the military moving from the provinces to retake Paris as in 1871. Minister of Defence Pierre Messmer and Chief of the Defence Staff Michel Fourquet prepared for such an action, and Pompidou had ordered tanks to Issy-les-Moulineaux. While the military was free of revolutionary sentiment, using an army mostly of conscripts the same age as the revolutionaries would have been very dangerous for the government. A survey conducted immediately after the crisis found that 20% of Frenchmen would have supported a revolution, 23% would have opposed it, and 57% would have avoided physical participation in the conflict. 33% would have fought a military intervention, while only 5% would have supported it and a majority of the country would have avoided any action.

===Election called===
At 2:30 p.m. on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded de Gaulle to dissolve the National Assembly and call a new election by threatening to resign. At 4:30 pm, de Gaulle broadcast his refusal to resign. He announced an election, scheduled for 23 June, and ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The government had leaked to the media that the army was outside Paris. Immediately after the speech, about 800,000 supporters marched through the Champs-Élysées waving the national flag; the Gaullists had planned the rally for several days, which attracted a crowd of diverse ages, occupations, and politics. The Communists agreed to the election, and the threat of revolution was over.

==Aftermath==
===Protest suppression and elections===
From that point, the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned several leftist organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. Contrary to de Gaulle&#x27;s fears, his party won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history in the legislative election held in June, taking 353 of 486 seats to the Communists&#x27; 34 and the Socialists&#x27; 57. The February Declaration and its promise to include Communists in government likely hurt the Socialists in the election. Their opponents cited the example of the Czechoslovak National Front government of 1945, which led to a Communist takeover of the country in 1948. Socialist voters were divided; in a February 1968 survey a majority had favored allying with the Communists, but 44% believed that Communists would attempt to seize power once in government (30% of Communist voters agreed).

On Bastille Day, there were resurgent street demonstrations in the Latin Quarter, led by socialist students, leftists and communists wearing red armbands and anarchists wearing black armbands. The Paris police and the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS) harshly responded starting around 10 pm and continuing through the night, on the streets, in police vans, at police stations, and in hospitals where many wounded were taken. There was, as a result, much bloodshed among students and tourists there for the evening&#x27;s festivities. No charges were filed against police or demonstrators, but the governments of Britain and West Germany filed formal protests, including for the indecent assault of two English schoolgirls by police in a police station.

===National feelings===
Despite the size of de Gaulle&#x27;s triumph, it was not a personal one. A post-crisis survey conducted by Mattei Dogan showed that a majority of the country saw de Gaulle as &quot;&#x27;too sure of himself&#x27; (70%), &#x27;too old to govern&#x27; (59%), &#x27;too authoritarian&#x27; (64%), &#x27;too concerned with his personal prestige&#x27; (69%), &#x27;too conservative&#x27; (63%), and &#x27;too anti-American&#x27; (69%)&quot;; as the April 1969 referendum would show, the country was ready for &quot;Gaullism without de Gaulle&quot;.

==Legacy==

May 1968 is an important reference point in French politics, representing for some the possibility of liberation and for others the dangers of anarchy. For some, May 1968 meant the end of traditional collective action and the beginning of a new era to be dominated mainly by the so-called new social movements.

Someone who took part in or supported this period of unrest is known as a (a &quot;68-er&quot;).

==Slogans and graffiti==

 (&quot;Under the paving stones, the beach!&quot;) is a slogan coined by student activist Bernard Cousin in collaboration with public relations expert Bernard Fritsch. The phrase became an emblem of the events and movement of the spring of 1968, when the revolutionary students began to build barricades in the streets of major cities by tearing up street pavement stone. As the first barricades were raised, the students recognized that the stone setts were placed atop sand. The slogan encapsulated the movement&#x27;s views on urbanization and modern society both literally and metaphorically.

<text>&quot;Minds, Machines and Gödel&quot; is J. R. Lucas&#x27;s 1959 philosophical paper in which he argues that a human mathematician cannot be accurately represented by an algorithmic automaton. Appealing to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, he argues that for any such automaton, there would be some mathematical formula which it could not prove, but which the human mathematician could both see, and show, to be true.

The paper is a Gödelian argument against mechanism.

Lucas presented the paper in 1959 to the Oxford Philosophical Society. It was first printed in &quot;Philosophy&quot;, XXXVI, 1961, then reprinted in &quot;The Modeling of Mind&quot;, Kenneth M. Sayre and Frederick J. Crosson, eds., Notre Dame Press, 1963, and in &quot;Minds and Machines&quot;, ed. Alan Ross Anderson, Prentice-Hall, 1964, .

<text>The Cathedral Range is a mountain range immediately to the south of Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park. The range is an offshoot of the Sierra Nevada. The range is named after Cathedral Peak, which resembles a cathedral spire.

==Geography==
The range includes Cathedral Peak, Unicorn Peak, Eichorn Pinnacle, Echo Peaks, Echo Ridge, Matthes Crest, Rafferty Peak, Vogelsang Peak, Fletcher Peak and Cockscomb. The highest point in the range is Mount Florence, one of the most prominent peaks in the Yosemite high country. The highest peak in Tuolumne Meadows is Johnson Peak.

The range runs beside the two Cathedral Lakes, just one mile southwest of Cathedral Peak. Hikers can access the lakes and Cathedral range by the John Muir trail from the trailhead in Tuolumne Meadows.

==Geology==
The mountains were formed by glaciers carving out the granite material; also see Cathedral Peak Granodiorite. The tops of the peaks in the range were above the level of the highest glaciation, and are therefore un-eroded and distinctly spire-like; see nunatak.

<doc id="311212" wikidata="Q3089528" url="?curid=311212" title="Air Canada Tango">
<text>Air Canada Tango was a low-cost subsidiary branch of Air Canada, which was established in 2001 to offer no-frills service on some of Air Canada&#x27;s routes and to reduce operating costs at the struggling main company. Based in Toronto, Tango operated on the major longer-distance Canadian routes between cities such as Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver, as well as to some holiday destinations in the United States and Mexico such as Fort Lauderdale, Seattle, Tampa and Mexico City.

The airline&#x27;s name is short for &quot;Tan and Go&quot;, which is in reference to the southern winter destinations that it had planned to serve.

==History==
The airline was launched on October 10, 2001, with tickets becoming first available for purchase on October 11, 2001. Tango commenced operations on November 1, 2001, with a fleet of Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-200 aircraft, offering fares of up to 80% off full-fare economy Air Canada fares. One innovation of Air Canada Tango was the requirement of electronic tickets, saving on ticket costs.

By 2004, the airline had ceased flying. After being consolidated into Air Canada, Tango&#x27;s website- &quot;flytango.com&quot;- redirected to Air Canada&#x27;s website, but as of September 2018, is offline.

Air Canada retained &quot;Tango&quot; as a brand name for its cheapest air fare category. Air Canada later revived the leisure-oriented &quot;airline within an airline&quot; concept as Air Canada Rouge in 2012, an airline that is still flying today.

==Fleet==
Air Canada Tango&#x27;s fleet consisted of Airbus A320-200 and Boeing 737-200 aircraft. The Boeing 737-200 were added to the fleet in 2002, but most left the fleet in late 2002/early 2003, being moved to another Air Canada subsidiarity, Zip, which retired them in 2004. The Airbus A320 stayed in Tango&#x27;s fleet until they ceased operations, with four moving to Air Canada Jetz, and the rest moving to the Air Canada mainline fleet.

Air Canada Tango aircraft were configured in a full economy class layout rather than with a business class section as on regular Air Canada aircraft and featured a distinctive purple colour scheme.

<doc id="311214" wikidata="Q1155562" url="?curid=311214" title="Rapport">
<text>Rapport ( ; ) is a close and harmonious relationship in which the people or groups concerned are &quot;in sync&quot; with each other, understand each other&#x27;s feelings or ideas, and communicate smoothly.

The word derives from the French verb which means literally to carry something back (in the sense of how people relate to each other: what one person sends out the other sends back). For example, people with rapport may realize that they share similar values, beliefs, knowledge, or behaviors around politics, music, or sports. This may also mean that they engage in reciprocal behaviors such as posture mirroring or increased coordination in their verbal and nonverbal interactions.

Rapport has been shown to have benefits for psychotherapy and medicine, negotiation, education, and tourism, among others. In each of these cases, the rapport between members of a dyad (e.g. a teacher and student or doctor and patient) allows the participants to coordinate their actions and establish a mutually beneficial working relationship, or what is often called a &quot;working alliance&quot;. In consumer-oriented guided group activities (e.g., a cooking class, a wine tour, and hiking group), rapport is not only dyadic and customer-employee oriented, but also customer-customer and group-oriented as customers consume and interact with each other in a group for an extended period.

== Building rapport ==
There are a number of techniques that are supposed to be beneficial in building rapport. These include matching body language (i.e., posture, gesture, etc.); indicating attentiveness through maintaining eye contact; and matching tempo, terminology, and breathing rhythm. In conversation, some verbal behaviors associated with increased rapport are the use of positivity (or, positive &quot;face management&quot;), sharing personal information of gradually increasing intimacy (or, &quot;self-disclosure&quot;), and reference to shared interests or experiences.

Building rapport can improve community-based research tactics, assist in finding a partner, improve student-teacher relationships, and allow employers to gain trust in employees.

Building rapport takes time. Extroverts tend to have an easier time building rapport than introverts. Extraversion accelerates the process due to an increase in confidence and skillfulness in social settings.

=== Methods ===

==== Coordination ====
Coordination, also called &quot;mirroring&quot; means getting into rhythm with another person, or resembling their verbal or nonverbal behaviors:
; Emotional mirroring : Empathizing with someone&#x27;s emotional state by being on &#x27;their side&#x27;. One listens for key words and problems so one can address and question them to better one&#x27;s understanding of what the other person is saying and demonstrate empathy towards them.
; Posture mirroring : Matching the tone of a person&#x27;s body language not through direct imitation (as this can appear as mockery) but through mirroring the general message of their posture and energy.
; Tone and tempo mirroring : Matching the tone, tempo, inflection, and volume of another person&#x27;s voice.

==== Mutual attentiveness ====
Another way to build rapport is for each partner to indicate their attentiveness to the other. This attentiveness may take the form of nonverbal attentiveness, such as looking at the other person, nodding at appropriate moments, or physical proximity, as seen in work on teachers&#x27; &quot;immediacy&quot; behaviors in the classroom. Attentiveness might also be demonstrated through reciprocation of nonverbal behaviors like smiling or nodding, in a similar way to the coordination technique, or in the reciprocal sharing of personal details about the other person that signal one&#x27;s knowledge and attentiveness to their needs.

==== Commonality ====
Commonality is the technique of deliberately finding something in common with a person in order to build a sense of camaraderie and trust.
This is done through references to shared interests, dislikes, and experiences. By sharing personal details or self-disclosing personal preferences or information, interlocutors can build commonality, and thus increase rapport.

==== Face management ====
Another way to build rapport is through &quot;positive face management&quot;, (or, more simply: positivity). According to some psychologists, we have a need to be seen in a positive light, known as our &quot;face&quot;. By managing each other&#x27;s &quot;face&quot;, boosting it when necessary, or reducing negative impacts to it, we build rapport with others.

== Maintaining rapport ==
In addition to building rapport, it is important to pay attention to the factors that can undermine rapport. Drawing on Spencer-Oatey’s earlier work on rapport management, she and Lazidou identify six factors or sensitivities that interlocutors need to take into account in order to avoid undermining rapport. Using the acronym GAAFFE, they call these the GAAFFE Triggers:

Goals: What each person wants to achieve.

Autonomy: The level of autonomy or direction that each person feels comfortable with.

Attention: The level of attention or connection that each person feels comfortable with.

Face: The respect and appreciation that each person wants to be shown.

Fairness: The fair treatment that each person wants to experience.

Ethical Principles: The upholding of ethical standards of behaviour.

The authors maintain that if there is a mismatch between the interlocutors in their interpretations or prioritisation of any of these triggers, rapport will be affected and typically undermined. This will lead to some kind of rapport reaction – an emotional reaction and/or an evaluative reaction. 

==Benefits==
A number of benefits from building interpersonal rapport have been proposed, all of which concern smoother interactions, improved collaboration, and improved interpersonal outcomes, though the specifics differ by the domain. These domains include but are not limited to healthcare, education, business, and social relationships.

In the health domain, provider-patient rapport is often called the &quot;therapeutic alliance&quot; or &quot;therapeutic relationship&quot;—the collaboration quality between provider and patient—which can predict therapy outcomes or patients&#x27; treatment adherence.

In education, teacher-student rapport is predictive of students&#x27; participation in the course, their course retention, their likelihood to take a course in that domain again, and has sometimes been used to predict course outcomes. Some have argued that teacher-student rapport is an essential element of what makes an effective teacher, or the ability to manage interpersonal relationships and build a positive, pro-social, atmosphere of trust and reduced anxiety. Student-student rapport, on the other hand, while largely out of the teacher&#x27;s ability to control, is also predictive of reduced anxiety in the course, feelings of a supportive class culture, and improved participation in class discussions. In these relationships, intentionally building rapport through individual meetings has shown an increase in student engagement and level of comfort in the classroom.

In negotiation, rapport is beneficial for reaching mutually beneficial outcomes, as partners are more likely to trust each other and be willing to cooperate and reach a positive outcome. However, interpersonal rapport in negotiation can lead to unethical behavior, particularly in impasse situations, where the interpersonal rapport may influence the negotiators to behave unethically.

In terms of social relationships such as friendship and romantic relationships, establishing rapport can build trust, increase feelings of closeness, and eliminate certain misunderstandings. Rapport is necessary in establishing satisfaction and understanding acceptable behaviors in an interpersonal relationship. Friendships and romantic relationships can overlap with other domains.

==The study of rapport==
To better study how rapport can lead to the above benefits, researchers generally adopt one of three main approaches: self-report surveys given to the participants, third-party observations from a naive observer, and some form of automated computational detection, using computer vision and machine learning.

Self-report surveys typically consist of a set of questions given at the end of an interpersonal interaction, asking the participants to reflect on their relationship with another person and rate various aspects of that relationship, typically on a Likert scale. Though this is the most common approach, it suffers from unreliability of self-report data, such as the issue of separating participants&#x27; reflection on a single interaction with their relationship with the other person more broadly.

A third-party observer can give a rapport rating to a particular segment (often called a &quot;slice&quot;) of such an interaction. Other recent work uses techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to computationally detect the level of rapport between members of a dyad.

=== Rapport and Technology ===
In the 21st century, online communication has had a huge impact on how business is conducted and how relationships are formed. In the era of Covid-19 and the shift to remote work and schooling, the way in which rapport is built has evolved. Communicating solely through online channels challenges rapport building. Challenges include technical difficulties interrupting video calls and direct messaging, interruptions and distractions from the user&#x27;s home, a lack of intimacy and the ability to observe one another, lack of eye contact, mundane interactions, and the &quot;pressure of presence&quot;.

<text>The interstellar space opera epic &quot;Star Wars&quot; uses science and technology in its settings and storylines. The series has showcased many technological concepts, both in the movies and in the expanded universe of novels, comics and other forms of media. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies&#x27; primary objective is to build upon drama, philosophy, political science and less on scientific knowledge. Many of the on-screen technologies created or borrowed for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe were used mainly as plot devices.

The iconic status that &quot;Star Wars&quot; has gained in popular culture and science fiction allows it to be used as an accessible introduction to real scientific concepts. Many of the features or technologies used in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe are not yet considered possible. Despite this, their concepts are still probable.

==Tatooine&#x27;s twin stars==

In the past, scientists thought that planets would be unlikely to form around binary stars. However, recent simulations indicate that planets are just as likely to form around binary star systems as single-star systems. Of the 3457 exoplanets currently known, 146 actually orbit binary star systems (and 39 orbit multiple star systems with three or more stars). Specifically, they orbit what are known as &quot;wide&quot; binary star systems where the two stars are fairly far apart (several AU). Tatooine appears to be of the other type — a &quot;close&quot; binary, where the stars are very close, and the planets orbit their common center of mass.

The first observationally confirmed binary — Kepler-16b — is a close binary. Exoplanet researchers&#x27; simulations indicate that planets form frequently around close binaries, though gravitational effects from the dual star system tend to make them very difficult to find with current Doppler and transit methods of planetary searches. In studies looking for dusty disks—where planet formation is likely—around binary stars, such disks were found in wide or narrow binaries, or those whose stars are more than 50 or less than 3 AU apart, respectively. Intermediate binaries, or those with between 3 and 50 AU between them, had no dusty disks. In 2011 it was reported by &quot;The Guardian&quot; that NASA space telescope Kepler had discovered a planet, named Kepler-16b, with twin suns as seen in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

Certified astrophysicist and &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan Jeanne Cavelos explains that scientists have been skeptical about the likelihood of binary star systems such as Tatooine since the gravity of one star may prevent planets from developing around the other. Two stars of different masses orbiting one another would cause gravity fields to shift, causing potential instabilities in the orbits of any planets in their system.

According to her, even planets in more stable orbits of a binary star system would suffer other kinds of problems such as climatic problems. As an example, a planet in a binary star system orbiting the larger star would be drawn closer to its gravitational field, causing the planet to endure heat of great temperatures during this period. As the planet passes its larger star and reaches the orbit of its smaller star, the gravitational field of that star would give the planet more distance from it. The distance (perhaps along with the smaller solar projection of the star) would send the planet into extreme frigid temperatures.

According to Cavelos, astronomers hypothesize at least two possible solutions to these problems exist and that even life supporting binary star systems could exist. One scenario could be two stars billions of kilometres apart. A planet or planets would be able to orbit one star while at minimum influence of the other. A star known as Proxima Centauri, or Alpha Centauri C, is about one trillion kilometres away from its sister stars, Alpha Centauri A and B. Also according to Cavelos, astronomers believe that Proxima Centauri could have planets of its own. If so, they would be minimally influenced by Proxima Centauri&#x27;s sister stars due to the vast distance between them and these sister stars. Assuming the existence of planets around Proxima Centauri, from these planets the sister suns would appear as bright stars in the sky.

Another scenario would be two stars that would be closer to one another at a distance of only a few million kilometres. A planet orbiting far enough away would be affected by their gravitational fields almost as if there were one. If the distance between the two stars was a small fraction of the distance between them and the planet, it would be stable for the planet. Dawn and dusk would occur on such a planet as they would on Tatooine.

==Blaster bolts==
&quot;Star Wars&quot; makes heavy use of blaster and ion weaponry, attributed to laser, plasma, or particle based bolts of light. Characters can be seen escaping, or even dodging those bolts, and the blaster bolts themselves can be seen flying at a moderate-fast speed. Dodging a laser bolt would be nearly impossible, as it would travel at the speed of light. Due to that, it is reasonable the blaster fire would pass like a sparkle, and hit its target. Sometimes, characters will call the bolts &quot;laser bolts&quot; that, while they do not travel at light speed, are made of intense light energy.

However, many official canonical &quot;Star Wars&quot; sources state that blaster technology is different from real lasers. According to official canon, they are a form of particle beam. This is supported by how &quot;magnetically sealed&quot; walls deflect them.

The Polish Academy of Sciences in collaboration with the University of Warsaw managed to film an ultra short laser pulse by using cameras that produce billions of frames per second. These laser pulses were so powerful that they almost instantly ionized the atoms they encountered, resulting in the formation of a plasma fiber filament.

The effects of a blaster on a live target were portrayed more or less the same in every part of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. Since blaster bolts consist of light or particle based energy, the bolts would burn through the flesh of a target, with some even exploding against their target, exerting great force. The latter effect was usually from a blaster with greater size. Blasters have even been shown to have plasma energy as ammunition, which is portrayed as blue bolts. As of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, these blue bolts rupture and damage flesh with little to no burning, which causes bleeding injuries, as Poe shot a Stormtrooper with a blaster that caused him to bleed until death. Another instance of a blaster causing bleeding was when Chewbacca shot Kylo Ren with his Bowcaster, the small explosion against his body causing a bleeding injury coupled with burns. In many modern showings of blaster fights, someone hit by a blaster has cinders and soot outlining the area where they were shot. Also blasters hit with great amounts of friction and kinetic energy, enough to cause sparks to fly off the target, make the target burst into flames, or kill a target on impact, even if the target is not penetrated by the bolt, as it is when some targets are armored against blasters.

==Vibration in vacuum==
&quot;Star Wars&quot; is famously known for its epic space dogfights. Blaster, engine, and explosion sounds can be heard in those space scenes. Space is a vacuum, however, and since sound requires matter to propagate, the audience should not hear any sound.

This has been explained in some &quot;Star Wars&quot; media as the result of a sensor system that creates three-dimensional sound inside the cockpit or bridge matching the external movement of other vessels, as a form of multimodal interface, although the audience is still able to hear sound even from a perspective that is in space. In the canon novel &quot;Lords of the Sith&quot; it is explained that the characters in a galaxy far, far away indeed do not hear any sound in space if no longer confined by their vessels:
Therefore, the ability to hear sound in a vacuum by the audience is not heard by the iconic characters, but only to the audience as an interpretation to imagine what sounds we hear in the films as out-of-universe artifacts.

==Asteroid field in &quot;Episode V&quot;==

In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, after the Battle of Hoth, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; is pursued by Imperial ships through a dense asteroid field. The chunks of rock in the field are moving at rapid speeds, constantly colliding, and densely packed. Ordinarily, an asteroid field or belt is unlikely to be so densely packed with large objects, because collisions reduce large objects to rubble. About the only way for an asteroid belt to maintain itself would be to &quot;balance destructive high-speed collisions with constructive soft collisions&quot;, but it is unclear whether this is happening in the film.

In contrast to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the ship featured in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Discovery One&quot;, had a course that took it directly through the asteroid belt in the novel, without real fear of collision on the part of the mission organizers. However, the Solar System&#x27;s Asteroid Belt is far less dense and several real spacecraft have passed through it without harm.

On the other hand, the so-called Trojan asteroid fields, named after the asteroids found in Jupiter-Sun Lagrange points, are known to be packed much more densely. The Solar System contains two such fields, the Greek Trojans and the Trojan Trojans, and two more (Neptune&#x27;s trojans) have been discovered recently, but little is known about them currently.

Also, contained within this scene is a portion in which Han and Leia emerge from the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, and are seen wearing only a facemask for air. The lack of pressure would have likely caused rapid decompression of their bodies, as the asteroid likely did not have an atmosphere. (See &quot;Effect of spaceflight on the human body&quot;.)

==Flight dynamics==
Unlike the true flight dynamics of space, those seen in &quot;Star Wars&quot; closely mirror the familiar dynamics of flying in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. For example, fixed-wing aircraft must make banked turns because they use air pressure to operate. Yet, in the airless vacuum of space in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the spaceships always (unnecessarily) bank when turning. Physicist Lawrence M. Krauss says this is for a simple reason: &quot;it looks good.&quot;
By banking, the center of gravity would be maintained so up is still up but the g forces generated at such speeds would surely injure the occupants. This is handled in the films by devices known as &quot;inertial compensators&quot;.

In order to turn in non-atmospheric flight, some force must still be applied to the craft, presumably by some sort of thruster or generated force field wave, the location of which (in relation to the craft&#x27;s centre of gravity) will dictate the orientation of the ship, or bank angle, required to make the turn.

==Destruction over Endor==

Following the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, there has been widespread speculation that the destruction of the second Death Star as seen in the film would cause a radiation spread on the forest moon of Endor&#x27;s atmosphere and surface, given that the explosion was caused by an attack on its (nuclear) core reactor.

The phenomenon has been around supposedly since 1997 following a number of comic book productions on &quot;Star Wars&quot; beyond the original trilogy (of unknown canonicity, although like most other works it has been declared non-canonical and part of the distinct &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; continuity in 2014) and has been known as &quot;The Endor Holocaust&quot;. It came about from a rational analysis in multiple commentaries of the aftermath of the second Death Star&#x27;s destruction and its hypothetical effects on the forest moon and its living inhabitants. Based on all the information from the stories, it has been concluded that a nuclear fallout would cause radioactive contamination on the surface of the planet (or moon), leading to widespread death and destruction.

More recent analysis by physicists has supported the theory from a scientific perspective.

Studying and analyzing the second Death Star&#x27;s destruction, physicists hypothesize its results and consequences. Astrophysicist and &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan Dave Mosher covers the film&#x27;s events in a 10,000 word essay. His first argument is the Death Star explosion resulting from the rebel attack on its nuclear reactor, the whole space station would be reduced to a large number of fine metallic pieces raining down on Endor. The debris would burn up in Endor&#x27;s atmosphere turning into toxic soot and spark planetary firestorms.

Another scientist, Sarah Stewart, reanalyzes the situation and theorizes the moon&#x27;s previous state after some environmental cleanup from the Death Star&#x27;s fallout.

Matija Cuk, who studies orbital dynamics, theorizes the Death Star&#x27;s reactor blowing up in one second, sending enormous chunks of debris at about 220,000 miles per hour. He argues the energy carried by the debris would not be sufficient to destroy the moon, but erode the side facing the Death Star. He also argues all ships near the Death Star at the time of its explosion would be destroyed by it. He also adds the rebels witnessing the explosion from the planet&#x27;s surface would be killed by the radiation released from the explosion even before the debris reaches them.

He concludes the debris following the explosion would strike the moon&#x27;s surface and would send rocks on the surface to the far side of the moon. In his analysis, the extinction of the Ewoks is inevitable.

Planetary physicist Erik Asphaug, who also studies giant impacts on moons and planets opposes these theories. He argues the Death Star would not be reduced to tiny bits following explosion. He argues that all nuclear explosions in rock would vaporize matter near it, but break matter a further distance away into pieces. The further away the pieces, the less they would break. He concludes large chunks of the Death Star would hit the forest moon&#x27;s surface, some even creating craters. The most problematic result in his analysis is the fire caused by the large radioactive debris that would set the moon&#x27;s forests ablaze.

A detailed analysis to the aftermath of the Death Star explosion in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; by planetary scientist Dave Minton, concludes all the Ewoks would have died as a result. Using the information provided from the holograms in the briefing scene aboard the giant cruiser &quot;Home One&quot; in Episode VI, Minton estimates the diameter of the Death Star (or &quot;Death Star II&quot; to distinguish it from the first Death Star in Episode IV: &quot;A New Hope&quot;) is about three hundred forty three kilometers or about seven percent the diameter of Endor.

This would make Endor slightly larger than Mars but about 15% the size of Earth. He also notes that in diameter, Endor would still be smaller than Mars, but denser in mass by his measurement formula. Endor&#x27;s composition being smaller would be unusual, but not impossible according to him.

He applies this data to the orbital dynamics problem. Discounting the possibility of the second Death Star being preserved in Endor&#x27;s orbit by the use of anti-gravitational repulsors (a commonality in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy), Minton instead compares the Death Star in the forest moon&#x27;s orbit to that of a satellite in Earth&#x27;s orbit. Applying Kepler&#x27;s Third Law, he determines an orbital period as exactly one day. But applying this law, he determines astrophysical problems with the Death Star using Endor&#x27;s gravity to sustain itself in the forest moon&#x27;s orbit. For simplicity, he assumes a day on Endor as 24 hours.

Minton also argues the explosion of the second Death Star in Episode VI is lighter than that of the first one in Episode IV. His argument is drawn from the two films where the one in &quot;A New Hope&quot; explodes instantaneously; wheres the second one in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; explodes in a longer time period, allowing the rebel pilots to escape alive and their ships unharmed by the explosion. The film specifically shows Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian hitting two main sections of the core reactor from an X-wing fighter and the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; (co-piloted by Nien Nunb), causing the reactor to collapse and start a chain explosion and resulting in the Death Star blowing up from a series of internal explosions and collapses.

Minton therefore concludes there would be little vaporization of remaining material and that the explosion would move a lot slower than what is required to keep them in orbit, which he estimates is about 212 miles per second. Using the equation representing orbital velocity of the Death Star, he theorizes the fragments would need to be orbiting at about 4.5 kilometers per second to maintain orbit at the same altitude the Death Star had been. Since this does not happen, he argues the remains of the former Death Star would fall straight into the area where the shield generator has been on the moon&#x27;s surface.

To estimate the effects of the second Death Star, Minton looks into its mass. According to estimated data from some students of Lehigh University, the steel mass needed for building one would be around 770 kilograms times the mass cubed in weight ⁠— ⁠this would give the Death Star a mass of about 1019 kg. Using this data, Minton produces equations that lead him to conclude the fragments would hit the moon&#x27;s surface so hard it would cause craters almost four times the size of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico. This impact would cause a planetary firestorm and vaporize all lifeforms on the moon.

==Hyperspace travel==

The hyperspace travel in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise requires two elements, light speed travel and hyperspace. Ships in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Universe have engines capable of propelling them to the speed of light. However, current physical theory states that it is impossible for any physical object to attain that speed, as long as the object has a non-zero mass, because an infinite amount of energy would be required to accelerate the mass to such a speed ⁠— ⁠a logical impossibility in our universe. Moreover, even if one were traveling at light speed, it would still take thousands of years to travel even a moderately sized galaxy. It is for these reasons that &quot;Star Wars&quot; space vessels use a &quot;hyperdrive&quot;.

This is explained by having the ships warp to another &quot;dimension&quot;, presumably a brane universe with different physical laws. Gravity supposedly reaches between branes. In &quot;Star Wars&quot;, gravity in real spaces forms gravitational &quot;mass shadows&quot; in hyperspace. Hyperspace in &quot;Star Wars&quot; is unrelated to the presumed space between universal &quot;bubbles&quot; in real life physics.

Hyperspace travel has also been noted to have some form of air resistance, as seen in , an episode of the &quot;Star Wars: the Clone Wars&quot; TV series. Trace Martez – smuggler and friend of Ahsoka Tano – apologises for flight turbulence on her heavily modified &quot;Nebula&quot;-class freighter, nicknamed the &quot;Silver Angel&quot;, having &quot;left the air brakes on&quot;. This would be normal, if Martez was encountering air resistance in the atmosphere of Coruscant - the planet she had just left. However, she only encountered turbulence once she entered hyperspace, which suggests that hyperspace has some form of gaseous atmosphere, for lack of a better term.

==Planets, moons and planetoids==
In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, almost everyone can breathe and move on many planets, and these, as well as the star systems, are treated as small places. Both defects have an accurate explanation.

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe states that many of the planets of the galaxy were colonized and adapted to the atmosphere and gravity of the most populated species, and there are also many species—such as Kel Dor and Skakoans—that need to use devices like breathing masks or pressurized suits. In the other case, since the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise develops itself to the intergalactic level, it is assumed that almost all the planets on it are planetary civilizations, a theory well-based in reality and that could possibly happen in a distant future.

The novelization of &quot;A New Hope&quot;, ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster, mentions that humans colonized Tatooine in the section introducing the Tusken Raiders. The section implies that humans colonized the planet and settled in the more remote areas of the much sparsely populated planet, which did not give much chance of contact between the Tusken Raiders and the human colonists, who settled on the planet in small numbers.

Also in the same novel, the section introducing the planet Yavin describes it as uninhabitable. Its satellite moons are described as planet sized. The fourth moon called &quot;Yavin IV&quot; as it was named by early human colonizers is described rich with plant and animal life. It describes an ancient civilization that once existed in the jungles of the moon but disappeared centuries before human explorers ever set foot on the moon. The only evidence of their existence the ancient architectural sites and monuments they left behind (as seen in the film), most of which were mysteriously built. At the time the Rebel Alliance used territory on Yavin as their hidden base, the only thing left on the moon was plant, insect and animal life.

Jeanne Cavelos points to the &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot; comic book series that document the early colonization of much of the populated &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy. Her argument is that the humans in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy being a single species, as well as appearing and living like human beings on Earth, likely originated from a single Earth-like planet, though the exact origin or home world of the human species in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe is not exactly known. She suggests that to be able to colonize other planets, the humans of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy could not have been genetically altered. She points to the fact that Luke Skywalker lived his life on Tatooine but did not require any genetic altering to adapt to Hoth, a planet with a climate estimately the opposite of Tatooine.

There are also problems with the possibility of humans altering the climate of the planet they colonize. She mentions the fact that there are native species on planets that humans live on, such as the Jawas alongside the Tusken Raiders on Tatooine who survive in the same climate as humans live on. If they lived in another climate prior to human colonization and environmental modification/alternation, such as terraforming, they are unlikely to survive.

Another possibility she suggests is the use of artificial aids that would help the colonists adapting to life on a newly settled planet before gradually adapting to life there. Some variations in climate and gravity would be adaptable to the colonists over a few generations as long as the variations are not too great. Through a period of generations, the colonists would evolve and adapt, even perhaps by evolutionary mutations.

There is also the unlikelihood of other planets having air just like Earth&#x27;s and automatically being breathable according to other scientists, Cavelos claims. Only a small number of such planets probably exist. The chances are greater of finding planets with similar atmospheres that would require minimal atmospheric modification, but unlikely to be identical to Earth&#x27;s that arriving humans could simply survive on them.

Another issue amongst this is that if human species would be unlikely to encounter a planet with an exact Earth-like environment, it would be even more unlikely for so many different alien species to be of the same environmental background and surviving in the same environmental conditions as seen at the Mos Eisley cantina in &quot;A New Hope&quot;.

==Lightsabers==
Often, lightsabers are said to be composed of lasers. However, using lasers raises several issues: 
*The necessity of something to reflect the end of the beam.
*Having a compact and powerful enough power source.
*Lasers do not clash when their beams cross.
*Lasers are silent.
*There are some materials that can withstand a lightsaber, and some can even deactivate one upon contact. 

Earlier forms of the weapon were known as &quot;protosabers&quot; in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy that required battery packs which were connected to the lightsaber hilt through a power cord. The battery pack was attached to a belt worn by the Jedi using the lightsaber, similar to how a flamethrower is worn, but was not ideal as it restricted the Jedi&#x27;s movements during combat.

Lightsabers have been generally explained as plasma kept in a force field, usually an electric or magnetic field. The force field could not be magnetic, because the field contains heat, something a magnetic field is incapable of doing. Thus, the force field must be a shield not known by modern technology. Additionally, when two plasma blades would come into direct contact, it would almost certainly result in magnetic reconnection, causing an explosive release of the plasma contained in both sabers.

The problems with lightsabers that use actual light blades mentioned at the beginning of this section are not all insurmountable. For instance, it is mentioned that &quot;Lasers do not clash when their beams cross&quot;, which is a statement based on our day-to-day experience with light. But Euler and Heisenberg have shown in 1936 that, for sufficiently high intensities, light can actually interact with itself (an effect due to quantum fluctuations of the vacuum). Given this, then it is possible to imagine a scenario of two lightsabers clashing in which photons coming from the hilt of one lightsaber are scattered toward the hilt of the other lightsaber (the scattering is done in the region where the two lightsabers overlap). Since photons have momentum, those scattered photons would exert radiation pressure on the hilt of the other lightsaber. Using techniques from ultrahigh intensity lasers, it has been shown that for lasers with an electric field strength of the order of 1015 V/m, the force felt in the hilt of each lightsabers is approximately 10 N (or roughly equivalent to the force exerted by a one kilogram object falling on a human foot). This force due to scattered photons would give an impression of blade solidity when the two lightsabers clash. An incredible amount of energy is necessary to power such a lightsaber. For instance, powering a lightsaber with an electric field strength of 1015 V/m for one minute requires 1025 J, or ten times less than the total energy output of the Sun in one second. If the energy source is nuclear fusion, such a lightsaber would require 1011 kg of nuclear fusion fuel to operate for one minute. In other words, one would need to fit the equivalent of ten Great Pyramid of Giza-s of nuclear fusion fuel in the hilt to operate such a lightsaber for one minute.

<text>The following is a list of the lieutenant governors of British Columbia. Though the present day office of the lieutenant governor in British Columbia came into being only upon the province&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation in 1871, the post is a continuation from the first governorship of Vancouver Island in 1849, although without the same executive powers as governors had. There were also colonial lieutenant-governors whose job was that of deputy to the governor.

<doc id="311221" wikidata="Q3358848" url="?curid=311221" title="Quintilis">
<text>In the ancient Roman calendar, Quintilis or Quinctilis was the month following Junius (June) and preceding Sextilis (August). &quot;Quintilis&quot; is Latin for &quot;fifth&quot;: it was the fifth month (&quot;quintilis mensis&quot;) in the earliest calendar attributed to Romulus, which began with Martius (&quot;Mars&#x27; month,&quot; March) and had 10 months. After the calendar reform that produced a 12-month year, Quintilis became the seventh month, but retained its name. In 45 BC, Julius Caesar instituted a new calendar (the Julian calendar) that corrected astronomical discrepancies in the old. After his death in 44 BC, the month of Quintilis, his birth month, was renamed Julius in his honor, hence July.

Quintilis was under the guardianship &quot;(tutela)&quot; of the Romans&#x27; supreme deity Jupiter, with sacrifices made particularly to Neptune and Apollo. Agricultural festivals directed at the harvest gradually lost their importance, and the month became dominated in urban Imperial Rome by the Ludi Apollinares, games &quot;(ludi)&quot; in honor of Apollo. Ten days of games were celebrated in honor of Julius Caesar at the end of the month.

==Dates==
Like the modern month of July, this was one of the &quot;long&quot; months that had 31 days. The Romans did not number days of a month sequentially from the 1st through the last day. Instead, they counted back from the three fixed points of the month: the Nones (&quot;Nonae,&quot; 5th or 7th, depending on the length of the month), the Ides (&quot;Idūs,&quot; 13th or 15th), and the Kalends (&quot;Kalendae,&quot; 1st) of the following month. Thus, the last day of Quintilis was the &quot;pridie Kalendas Sextilis&quot;, &quot;day before the Kalends of Sextilis&quot; (August). Roman counting was inclusive; July 5 was &quot;ante diem III Nonas Quintilis&quot;, &quot;the 3rd day before the Nones (7th) of Quintilis,&quot; usually abbreviated &quot;a.d. III Non. Quint.&quot; (or with the &quot;a.d.&quot; omitted altogether); July 23 was &quot;X. Kal. Sext.&quot;, &quot;the 10th day before the Kalends of Sextilis.&quot;
Each day was marked with a letter such as F for &quot;dies fasti&quot;, days when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of civil law; C, for &quot;dies comitalis,&quot; a day on which the Roman people could hold assemblies &quot;(comitia)&quot;, elections, and certain kinds of judicial proceedings; N for &quot;dies nefasti&quot;, when these political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited; or NP, the meaning of which remains elusive, but which marked &quot;feriae&quot;, public holidays. Days were also marked with nundinal letters in cycles of &quot;A B C D E F G H&quot;, to mark the &quot;market week&quot; A &quot;dies natalis&quot; was an anniversary such as a temple founding or rededication, sometimes thought of as the &quot;birthday&quot; of a deity. On a &quot;dies religiosus&quot;, individuals were not to undertake any new activity, nor do anything other than tend to the most basic necessities.

During the Imperial period, some of the traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. On the calendar of military religious observances known as the &quot;Feriale Duranum&quot;, sacrifices pertaining to Imperial cult outnumber the older festivals. After the latter 1st century AD, a number of dates are added to calendars for spectacles and games &quot;(ludi)&quot; held in honor of various deities in the venue called a &quot;circus&quot; &quot;(ludi circenses)&quot;. By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show days marked with letters &quot;(F, N, C&quot; and so on) to show their religious status, probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius.

Unless otherwise noted, the dating and observances on the following table are from H.H. Scullard, &quot;Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic&quot; (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 158–169.

<doc id="311223" wikidata="Q3100894" url="?curid=311223" title="Sextilis">
<text>Sextilis () or mensis Sextilis was the Latin name for what was originally the sixth month in the Roman calendar, when March (&quot;Martius&quot;, &quot;Mars&#x27; month&quot;) was the first of ten months in the year. After the calendar reform that produced a twelve-month year, Sextilis became the eighth month, but retained its name. It was renamed Augustus (August) in 8 BC in honor of the first Roman emperor, Augustus. Sextilis followed Quinctilis, which was renamed &quot;Julius&quot; (July) after Julius Caesar, and preceded September (from &quot;septem&quot;, &quot;seven&quot;), which was originally the seventh month.

==The month &quot;Augustus&quot;==
&quot;Julius&quot; (July) was renamed from &quot;Quintilis&quot; (&quot;fifth&quot; month) in honor of Julius Caesar, who had adopted his grand-nephew Octavian, the future Augustus, and made him his heir. It has sometimes been thought that the month has 31 days because Augustus wanted as many days in his month as in his predecessor&#x27;s, but Sextilis in fact had 31 days since the reform during Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship that created the Julian calendar.

The decree of the Senate &quot;(senatus consultum)&quot; renaming Sextilis reads in part:
Whereas the emperor Augustus Caesar, in the month of Sextilis, was first admitted to the consulate, and thrice entered the city in triumph, and in the same month the legions, from the Janiculum, placed themselves under his auspices, and in the same month Egypt was brought under the authority of the Roman people, and in the same month an end was put to the civil wars; and whereas for these reasons the said month is, and has been, most fortunate to this empire, it is hereby decreed by the senate that the said month shall be called Augustus.

==Iconography of the month==
The Calendar of Filocalus illustrated the month of August with a seasonal representation of summer&#x27;s heat. A peacock fan overhangs a nude male who drinks from a large bowl, with his cast-off garment in the top right corner. The amphora beside him is sealed with a flower and in one extant copy is inscribed &quot;ZLS&quot;, probably a mistaken transcription for the Greek exhortation &quot;zeses&quot;, &quot;to your health&quot;. Three mature gourds or melons are another seasonal motif.

==Dates==
The Romans did not number days of a month sequentially from the 1st through the last day. Instead, they counted back from the three fixed points of the month: the Nones (5th or 7th, depending on the length of the month), the Ides (13th or 15th), and the Kalends (1st) of the following month. The Nones of August was the 5th, and the Ides the 13th. The last day of August was the &quot;pridie Kalendas Septembris,&quot; &quot;day before the Kalends of September&quot;. Roman counting was inclusive; 9 August was &quot;ante diem V Idūs Sextīlis&quot; (&quot;ante diem V Idūs Augustas&quot;), &quot;the 5th day before the Ides of August,&quot; usually abbreviated &quot;a.d. V Id. Sext.&quot; (&quot;a.d. V Id. Aug.&quot;), or with the &quot;a.d.&quot; omitted altogether. The Julian calendar reform added two days to Sextilis; thus on the pre-reform calendar, 23 August was &quot;VIII Kal. Sept.&quot;, &quot;the 8th day before the Kalends of September,&quot; but on the Julian calendar &quot;X Kal. Sept.&quot;, &quot;the 10th day before the Kalends of September&quot;.

On the calendar of the Roman Republic and early Principate, each day was marked with a letter to denote its religiously lawful status. In August, these were:
* F for &quot;dies fasti&quot;, days when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of civil law;
* C, for &quot;dies comitalis,&quot; a day on which the Roman people could hold assemblies &quot;(comitia)&quot;, elections, and certain kinds of judicial proceedings;
* N for &quot;dies nefasti&quot;, when these political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited;
* NP, the meaning of which remains elusive, but which marked &quot;feriae&quot;, public holidays;
* EN for &quot;endotercissus&quot;, an archaic form of &quot;intercissus&quot;, &quot;cut in half,&quot; meaning days that were &quot;nefasti&quot; in the morning, when sacrifices were being prepared, and in the evening, while sacrifices were being offered, but were &quot;fasti&quot; in the middle of the day.
Days were also marked with nundinal letters in cycles of &quot;A B C D E F G H&quot;, to mark the &quot;market week&quot; (these are omitted in the table below).

A &quot;dies natalis&quot; was an anniversary such as a temple founding or rededication, sometimes thought of as the &quot;birthday&quot; of a deity. During the Imperial period, some of the traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. On the calendar of military religious observances known as the &quot;Feriale Duranum&quot;, sacrifices pertaining to Imperial cult outnumber the older festivals. After the mid-1st century AD, a number of dates are added to calendars for spectacles and games &quot;(circenses)&quot; held in honor of various deities in the venue called a &quot;circus&quot;. By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show days marked with letters &quot;(F, N, C&quot; and so on) to show their religious status, probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius. Festivals marked in large letters on extant &quot;fasti&quot;, represented by festival names in all capital letters on the table, are thought to have been the most ancient holidays, becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC.

Unless otherwise noted, the dating and observances on the following table are from H.H. Scullard, &quot;Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic&quot; (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 169–182. After the Ides, dates are given for the Julian calendar, with pre-Julian dates noted parenthetically for festivals.

<text>The prime minister of South Africa ( was the head of government in South Africa between 1910 and 1984.

==History of the office==

The position of Prime Minister was established in 1910, when the Union of South Africa was formed. He was appointed by the head of state—the governor-general until 1961 and the state president after South Africa became a republic in 1961. In practice, he was the leader of the majority party or coalition in the House of Assembly. With few exceptions, the governor-general/state president was bound by convention to act on the prime minister&#x27;s advice. Thus, the prime minister was the country&#x27;s leading political figure and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive, with powers similar to those of his British counterpart.

The first prime minister was Louis Botha, a former Boer general and war hero during the Second Boer War.

The position of Prime Minister was abolished in 1984, when the State President was given executive powers after a new constitution was adopted – effectively merging the role of Prime Minister and State President. The last Prime Minister of South Africa, P. W. Botha, became the first executive State President after the constitutional reform in 1984 after Marais Viljoen&#x27;s retirement. After Botha, F. W. de Klerk became the last president and head of state for the apartheid regime in South Africa. Both Botha and de Klerk were members of the National Party which was responsible for implementing apartheid.

In post-apartheid South Africa, the Inkatha Freedom Party has called for a return to a Westminster-style split executive with a Prime Minister as head of government, which is part of its overarching goal of avoiding a single-party South African state.

<text>Sephira also known as &quot;Sephira - The Irish Rock Violinists&quot; are an Irish band consisting of sisters Joyce and Ruth O&#x27;Leary, who both play the violin and provide vocals. 

They released their debut album &quot;Believe&quot; in 2006. Its style is classical crossover with traditional Irish influences.

== Early life and education ==
The sisters are from Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, Ireland. 

They started studying violin in early childhood: Joyce at two years of age and a half and Ruth at six. Joyce performed in the National Concert Hall, Dublin aged just three, playing a Bach minuet. She was named Ireland&#x27;s Most Promising Violinist when she was nine.

Ruth studied music performance at London&#x27;s Guildhall School of Music to study for a BA in Music Performance. She continued her studies in Dublin, where she received a first-class honours B.A. with a performance of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto at the National Concert Hall, Dublin. During her years of study, Ruth performed with acts such as Rodrigo y Gabriela and featured on their &quot;Live in Manchester and Dublin&quot; album.

== Performances ==
Sephira toured the US with the PBS show Celtic Thunder between 2008 and 2010. They have also played with Enya, Andrea Bocelli, Kanye West and Michael Buble.

Specializing in theater shows, corporate events, and private events, they have performed at private events for Prince Albert of Monaco, the late Larry Hagman, Priscilla Presley, Linda Gray and the women of Congress in Washington, D.C. They have also performed for other dignitaries including a US president, US vice president, US Secretary of Homeland Security, and the US National Coast Guard Foundation.

==Personal Lives==
In 2014 the sisters spoke out about their health issues with hemochromatosis and autoimmune disorders, urging other people to get checked for these conditions.

== Background to Albums ==
*&quot;Believe&quot; (2006). The album was recorded in The Cauldron Studios, Dublin, and was produced by producer and instrumentalist Bill Shanley. Other musicians featured on the album include Ruby Ashley, William Butt, Noel Eccles, Karen Hamill, and former band member Colm Henry.
*&quot;Sephira&quot; (2008) released for the US market. This was a mix of &quot;Believe&quot; favourites and the 2008 EP &quot;Love of my Life&quot;.
*&quot;Starlight&quot; (2011) was a Christmas album.
*&quot;Eternity&quot; (2012). This EP was dedicated to their late friend and mentor, Larry Hagman.

<doc id="311236" wikidata="Q185099" url="?curid=311236" title="Water rail">
<text>The water rail (Rallus aquaticus) is a bird of the rail family which breeds in well-vegetated wetlands across Europe, Asia and North Africa. Northern and eastern populations are migratory, but this species is a permanent resident in the warmer parts of its breeding range. The adult is long, and, like other rails, has a body that is flattened laterally, allowing it easier passage through the reed beds it inhabits. It has mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey underparts, black barring on the flanks, long toes, a short tail and a long reddish bill. Immature birds are generally similar in appearance to the adults, but the blue-grey in the plumage is replaced by buff. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails. The former subspecies &quot;R. indicus&quot;, has distinctive markings and a call that is very different from the pig-like squeal of the western races, and is now usually split as a separate species, the brown-cheeked rail.

The water rail breeds in reed beds and other marshy sites with tall, dense vegetation, building its nest a little above the water level from whatever plants are available nearby. The off-white, blotched eggs are incubated mainly by the female, and the precocial downy chicks hatch in 19–22 days. The female will defend her eggs and brood against intruders, or move them to another location if they are discovered. This species can breed after its first year, and it normally raises two clutches in each season. Water rails are omnivorous, feeding mainly on invertebrates during summer and berries or plant stems towards winter. They are territorial even after breeding, and will aggressively defend feeding areas in winter.

These rails are vulnerable to flooding or freezing conditions, loss of habitat and predation by mammals and large birds. The introduced American mink has exterminated some island populations, but overall the species&#x27; huge range and large numbers mean that it is not considered to be threatened.

==Taxonomy==
The rails are a bird family comprising around 150 species. Although the origins of the group are lost in antiquity, the largest number of species and the most primitive forms are found in the Old World, suggesting that this family originated there. However, the genus &quot;Rallus&quot;, the group of long-billed reed bed specialists to which the water rail belongs, arose in the New World. Its Old World members, the water, African and Madagascar rails, form a superspecies, and are thought to have evolved from a single invasion from across the Atlantic. Genetic evidence suggests that the water rail is the most closely related of its genus to the Pacific &quot;Gallirallus&quot; rails, and is basal to that group. The water rail was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name, &quot;Rallus aquaticus&quot;. The binomial name is the Latin equivalent of the English &quot;water rail&quot; that had been used by English ornithologists Francis Willughby in 1676 and by Eleazar Albin in 1731.

The former subspecies &quot;R. a. indicus&quot; has very different vocalisations from the water rail, and it was considered to be a separate species in early works. It was restored as a full species &quot;R. indicus&quot;, by Pamela Rasmussen in her &quot;Birds of South Asia&quot; (2005). Her treatment has gained acceptance, and is followed in &quot;Birds of Malaysia and Singapore&quot; (2010). A 2010 study of molecular phylogeny further supported the possibility of specific status for &quot;R. indicus&quot;, which is estimated to have diverged from the Western forms around 534,000 years ago.

===Fossils===
The oldest known fossils of an ancestral water rail are bones from Carpathia dated to the Pliocene (1.8-5.3 million years ago). By the late Pleistocene, two million years ago, the fossil evidence suggests that the water rail was present across most of its present range. This species is well-recorded, with over 30 records from Bulgaria alone, and many others from across southern Europe. and China. A rail from Eivissa, &quot;Rallus eivissensis&quot;, was smaller but more robust than the water rail, and probably had poorer flight abilities. In the Quaternary, the island lacked terrestrial mammals, and this distinctive form presumably descended from its continental relative. It became extinct at about the same time as human arrival on the island, between 16,700 and 5,300 BC. The nominate race of water rail is now a very rare resident on Eivissa.

==Description==

The adult of the nominate subspecies is a medium-sized rail, long with a wingspan. Males typically weigh and females are slightly lighter at . The upper parts from the forehead to tail are olive-brown with black streaks, especially on the shoulders. The sides of the head and the underparts down to the upper belly are dark slate-blue, except for a blackish area between bill and eye, and brownish sides to the upper breast. The flanks are barred black and white, and the undertail is white with some darker streaks. The long bill and the iris are red, and the legs are flesh-brown. The sexes are similar; although the female averages slightly smaller than the male, with a more slender bill, determining sex through measurements alone is unreliable. The juvenile has a blackish crown and a white chin and throat. The underparts are buff or white with darker bars, and the flank markings are brown and buff, rather than black and white. The undertail is buff, and the eye, bill and leg colours are duller than the adult. The downy chick is all black apart from a mainly white bill. After breeding, the rail has an extensive moult, and is flightless for about three weeks. Individual adults can be identified by the markings on the undertail, which are unique to each bird. Adult males have the strongest black undertail streaks. It has been suggested that the dark barring on the undertail of this species is a compromise between the signalling function of a pure white undertail, as found in open water or species like the common moorhen, and the need to avoid being too conspicuous.

The water rail can readily be distinguished from most other reed bed rails by its white undertail and red bill; the latter is a little longer than the rest of the rail&#x27;s head (55–58% of the total) and slightly down-curved. The somewhat similar slaty-breasted rail of tropical Asia has a stouter bill, a chestnut crown and white-spotted upperparts. Juvenile and freshly moulted water rails may show a buff undertail like spotted crake, but that species&#x27; plumage is spotted with white, and it has a much shorter, mainly yellowish bill. The range of the water rail does not overlap with that of any other &quot;Rallus&quot; species, but vagrants could be distinguished from their American relatives by the lack of rufous or chestnut on the closed wing. The larger African rail has unstreaked darker brown upperparts and brighter red legs and feet.

===Vocalisations===
The water rail is a vocal species which gives its main call, known as &quot;sharming&quot;, throughout the year. This is a series of grunts followed by a high-pitched piglet-like squeal and ending in more grunts. It is used as a territorial call, alarm and announcement. Members of a pair may call alternately, the male giving lower and slower notes than his partner. The courtship song, given by both sexes, is a &#x27; often ending with a trill from the female; the male may sing for hours. The flight call is a sharp whistle, and other vocalizations include a loud repeated creak given by the male when showing the nest site to the female, and a purring given by both parents when at the nest with chicks. The rails are most vocal when setting up a territory and early in the breeding season, when calling may continue at night. Chicks initially cheep weakly, but soon develop a &#x27; begging call.

When researchers played recordings of the reed warbler at night to attract that species for trapping, they found water rails and other wetland birds were also grounded, despite a lack of suitable habitat, suggesting that the rails and other nocturnal migrants recognised the warbler&#x27;s song and associated it with the marshy habitat in which it is usually found.

===Subspecies===

There are three recognised subspecies.

* &quot;R. a. aquaticus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758. This is the nominate subspecies that breeds in Europe, North Africa, Turkey, western Asia to the Caspian Sea and western Kazakhstan, and in a narrow band east to central Siberia.
* &quot;R. a. hibernans&quot; Salomonsen, 1931. The Icelandic race, which has slightly warmer brown upperparts than the nominate form. The bars of the flanks are dark brown, not black, and the bill is somewhat shorter; the grey of the underparts may have a brown tinge.
* &quot;R. a. korejewi&quot; Zarudny, 1905. (includes the dubious forms &quot;deserticolor&quot;, &quot;tsaidamensis&quot; and &quot;arjanicus&quot;). This subspecies breeds in south central Asia from southern and eastern Iran east to Eastern China (Sometimes in Beijing, Shanghai etc.), and in the Indian subcontinent in Kashmir and Ladakh. It is slightly larger than the nominate race, with paler brown upperparts and slightly paler slate underparts. It has a weak brown stripe through the eye.

The differences between the three other races appear to be clinal, and it is possible that they should all be merged into &quot;R. a. aquaticus&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

The water rail breeds across temperate Eurasia from Iceland and Ireland discontinuously to North Africa, Saudi Arabia and western China. Its distribution in Asia is poorly studied.

The Icelandic population of water rail, &quot;R. a. hibernans&quot;, became extinct around 1965, as a result of loss of habitat through the draining of wetlands, and predation by the introduced American mink.

Prior to its extinction, at least some birds were present year-round on the island, relying on warm volcanic springs to survive through the coldest months, but this race was also found in winter in the Faroe Islands and Ireland, and on passage through the Western Isles, suggesting that the Icelandic form was a partial migrant. The nominate subspecies, &quot;R. a. aquaticus&quot; is resident in the milder south and west of its range, but migrates south from areas that are subject to harsh winters. It winters within its breeding range, and also further south in North Africa, the Middle East and the Caspian Sea area. The peak migration period is September to October, with most birds returning to the breeding grounds from March to mid-April. A specimen of the nominate population labelled as &quot;Baluchistan&quot; and collected by Richard Meinertzhagen is considered of doubtful provenance. &quot;R. a. korejewi&quot; is another partial migrant, with some of the population wintering from Iraq and eastern Saudi Arabia eastwards through Pakistan and northern India to western China.

The breeding habitat of the water rail is permanent wetland with still or slow-moving fresh or brackish water and dense, tall vegetation, which may include common reed, reedmace, irises, bur-reed or sedges. In coastal areas, sea rush is common in saltmarsh breeding sites, with sedges and bur-reed dominant in somewhat less saline environments. A study in the Netherlands and Spain showed that the rush provided better concealment than the other maritime plants. As elsewhere, nests were constructed from the nearest available plants. Where it occurs, saw-sedge provides good breeding habitat, its tall () dense structure providing good cover for the nesting rails. The preferred habitat is &quot;Phragmites&quot; reedbed with the plants standing in water, with a depth of , muddy areas for feeding and a rich diversity of invertebrate species. Locations with nearby willows or shrubs are favoured above large areas of uniform habitat. In addition to natural fresh or marine marshes, this rail may use gravel or clay excavations and peat workings as long as there is suitable habitat with good cover. It may be found in rice paddies or on floating islands, and it occurs in Kashmir in flooded sugarcane fields. A Finnish study showed that the main factor influencing the distribution of water rails was the extent of vegetation cover, with the highest densities in the most vegetated areas; the presence of other marshes nearby was also significant. However, factors such as temperature, rainfall, length of shore line and extent of peat, important for some other marsh birds, were not statistically relevant. The areas with the highest densities of the rail also had the greatest numbers of three species considered at risk in Finland, the great reed warbler, Eurasian bittern and marsh harrier. The northern limit of breeding seems to be determined by the transition from nutrient-rich wetland to poorer, more acidic water. This leads to the replacement of common reed by a more open vegetation type dominated by marsh cinquefoil, which is unsuitable for the rails.

Occasionally, more unusual locations are used. One pair in Scotland nested in the open by the side of a road, and when an English nature reserve installed nest boxes for bearded tits (reed &quot;wigwams&quot; with a wooden floor), rails nested both in the boxes and under the wooden floor, in the latter case sometimes with the tits in residence above. Although mainly a lowland species, the water rail breeds at in the Alps and in Armenia. An Italian study suggested that reed bed birds need a minimum area of wetland for breeding, which for the water rail is about , although the highest densities are in marshes of or more.

On migration and in winter, a wider range of wet habitats may be used, including flooded thickets or bracken. Freezing condition may force birds into more open locations such as ditches, rubbish dumps and gardens, or even out onto exposed ice. A Welsh study suggested that individual winter territories overlap, with each bird using a significant proportion of the reed bed. After site desertion in freezing weather, birds return to their former range. A density of 14 birds per hectare (6.6 per acre) was recorded. Birds wintering in Iceland rely on warm geothermal streams, and may access streams through tunnels under the snow. When not feeding, they may shelter in holes and crevices in the solidified lava. This species sometimes wanders well outside its normal range and vagrants have been found in the Azores, Madeira, Mauritania, the Arctic, Greenland, Malaysia and Vietnam.

==Behaviour==
This rail is a skulking species, its streaked plumage making it difficult to see in its wetland habitat. Its laterally compressed body allows it to slip though the densest vegetation, and it will &quot;freeze&quot; if surprised in the open. It walks with a high-stepping gait, although it adopts a crouch when it runs for cover. It swims, when necessary, with the jerky motion typical of rails, and it flies short distances low over the reeds with its long legs dangling. Although their flight looks weak, water rails are capable of long sustained flights during their nocturnal migrations, and are sometimes killed in collisions with lighthouses or wires. British-ringed birds have been recovered from as far away as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Sweden.

This species defends its breeding and wintering territories. Birds will charge each other with neck outstretched when breeding, sometimes both members of a pair attacking together. Large strongly-marked males are dominant in winter, when the direct aggression is replaced by sharming while standing upright on tip-toe, head jerking and bill thrusting.

===Breeding===

The water rail is monogamous and highly territorial when breeding. The birds pair off after arriving at their nesting areas, or possibly even before spring migration. In large wetlands with good conditions birds may nest apart. Territories vary in size, but is typical. The pair give courting and contact calls throughout the breeding season. The male selects the nest site which he shows to the female while posturing with raised back feathers, wings arched over his back, tail spread and bill pointed vertically downwards. This display is accompanied by a loud call. Before mating, he raises his wings and tail, and bows with his bill touching his breast. The male feeds the female during courtship, and, when incubating, she may leave the nest to display to the male, walking round him, calling softly, rubbing her bill against his and taking short runs to and from him.

The nest is made from whatever wetland vegetation is available and built mostly by the male, usually in a single day. It is raised or more above the level of the marsh, and is sometimes constructed on clumps of roots, tree stumps or similar support. It may be built up higher if the marsh waters start to rise. The nest is across and about high. It is well hidden and approached by narrow tracks.

The typical clutch is 6–11 eggs across most of the range, but appears to be smaller (5–8) in Kashmir at around altitude. Laying dates vary with location, from late March in Western Europe and North Africa, to late May in Kashmir and June in Iceland. The clutch size may be smaller early or late in the breeding season. The breeding season can be extended by replacement and second clutches. The eggs are blunt and oval, smooth and slightly glossy; the colour varies from off-white to pink-buff, with reddish-brown blotches mainly at the broader end that sometimes merging into a single patch. Variation in egg size across the four subspecies is much less than the differences between individual eggs; the average size of the eggs of the nominate subspecies, , is therefore typical for the species as a whole. The eggs weigh about , of which 7% is shell.

Both parents incubate the eggs, although the female takes the larger share of this duty. The eggs are incubated for 19–22 days to hatching, with at least 87% success. Food is brought to the nest by the other adult and passed to the sitting parent who feeds the chicks. The precocial, downy young leave the nest within two days of hatching but continue to be fed by their parents, although the chicks also find some of their own food after about five days. They are independent of their parents after 20–30 days and can fly when aged 7–9 weeks. If a nest appears to have been discovered, the female may carry the chicks or eggs one by one to another location; the eggs are carried in the bill, but small chicks may be tucked under the wing. Sitting birds may stay on the eggs even when approached closely, attack the intruder, or feign injury as a distraction. The water rail can breed after its first year, and it normally raises two broods.

Average survival after fledging has been estimated as between 17 and 20 months, with an annual survival rate slightly less than 50% per year for the first three years, and somewhat higher thereafter. The maximum recorded age is 8 years 10 months.

===Feeding===

Water rails are omnivorous, although they mainly feed on animals. These include leeches, worms, gastropods, small crustaceans, spiders, and a wide range of both terrestrial and aquatic insects and their larvae. Small vertebrates such as amphibians, fish, birds and mammals may be killed or eaten as carrion. Vertebrates are impaled with a strike of the bill which breaks the prey&#x27;s spinal cord. Plant food, which is consumed more in autumn and winter, includes the buds, flowers, shoots and seeds of water plants, berries and fruit. In south Asia, paddy (harvested rice kernels) may sometimes be eaten. The young rails are fed mainly on insects and spiders. Food obtained on land or from mud is normally washed in water before it is eaten. After rain, rails may probe soft ground for earthworms. This species will occasionally feed in the open even when not forced to do so by cold weather; Edmund Meade-Waldo described seven rails feeding in an open meadow. Despite its skulking nature, the water rail appears to thrive in captivity when fed on animal food such as raw meat or earthworms; one individual was taught to jump for worms suspended from a fishing rod.

Water rails follow definite routes when feeding, frequently returning to good hunting areas. These rails are versatile and opportunist foragers. They will jump to take insects from plants, climb to find berries, or dislodge apples from trees so they can be eaten on the ground. They will kill birds by impaling or drowning them, particularly if the bird&#x27;s ability to escape is restricted. They have been recorded as killing a European greenfinch and a king quail in an aviary, and small birds trapped in bird ringers&#x27; mist nets. One bird killed a twite caught with it in a Heligoland trap. They are also nest predators, particularly of small birds that nest in reeds such as the great reed warbler. Water rails may defend a winter feeding territory, although this is smaller than when breeding, with individuals perhaps less than apart; favoured sites may hold hundreds of birds. Aggressive behaviour outside the breeding season may extend to attacks on other marsh rails such as spotted and Baillon&#x27;s crake.

==Predators and parasites==
Predators of the water rail include a number of mammals and large birds. The American mink was partly responsible for the extinction of the Icelandic population, and cats and dogs have also been recorded as killing this species. At least locally, otters will also eat rails and other water birds. The Eurasian bittern, another reed bed bird, will consume rails, as will grey herons. Water rails are particularly vulnerable to the heron when forced out of the cover of the reeds by very high tides. Wetland-hunting harriers are predictable predators, but more unusually, the rail has also been recorded as a prey item of the tawny owl, short-eared owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, greater spotted eagle, common kestrel, and night-hunting peregrine falcons.

Parasites include the sucking lice &quot;Nirmus cuspidiculus&quot; and &quot;Pediculus ralli&quot;, the tick &quot;Ixodes frontalis&quot;, and the louse fly &quot;Ornithomyia avicularia&quot;. The water rail can be infected by the avian influenza virus and the bacterium &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;, carried by &quot;Ixodes&quot; ticks, which is also a human pathogen causing Lyme disease. Three lice, &quot;Fulicoffula rallina&quot;, &quot;Pseudomenopon scopulacorne&quot; and &quot;Rallicola cuspidatus&quot; discovered on dead water rails in 2005 on the Faroe Islands were all species that had not been found on the archipelago previously. The parasitic flatworm &quot;Ophthalmophagus nasciola&quot; was found in one rail&#x27;s nasal sinus, and at least three species of feather mite have been detected on the plumage. The louse &quot;Philopterus ralli&quot; and the nematode &quot;Strongyloides avium&quot; have been found on the closely related brown-cheeked rail &quot;R. a. indicus&quot;.

==Status==

The water rail&#x27;s numbers are declining, but it has a large population of 100,000–1,000,000 adults and a huge breeding range estimated at ; it is therefore classed as &quot;least concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List. In most European countries, the population is either stable or decreasing slightly due to loss of habitat. The rail&#x27;s range and numbers are increasing in Morocco, with breeding as far south as Oued Massa. Little is known about the Asian range, but &quot;korejewi&quot; is a common breeder in Pakistan and Kashmir.

Introduced predators are a threat to vulnerable island populations. In addition to the extirpation of the Icelandic race, mink have been responsible for marked declines in the populations of water rails and other ground-nesting birds in the Hebrides, where the mainly fish-eating otter was the only native carnivore. The mink derived from fur farms on Lewis, from whence they spread through Harris, North Uist and South Uist. Mink and ferret eradication programmes have enabled the rail to return to islands including Lewis and Harris, and further projects are ongoing or planned on the Scottish mainland. Locally, habitat may be affected by the drainage of marshes, canalisation of water courses, urban encroachment, and by pollution.

Water rails have been eaten by humans for thousands of years; they were eaten by the Romans, and depicted in wall paintings at Pompeii, and consumption continued through the Middle Ages to modern times.

<text>The Dumb Waiter is a one-act play by Harold Pinter written in 1957.

==Plot==
Two hit-men, Ben and Gus, are waiting in a basement room for their assignment. As the play begins, Ben, the senior member of the team, is reading a newspaper, and Gus, the junior member, is tying his shoes. Gus asks Ben many questions as he gets ready for their job and tries to make tea. They argue over the semantics of &quot;light the kettle&quot; and &quot;put on the kettle&quot;. Ben continues reading his paper for most of the time, occasionally reading excerpts of it to Gus. Ben gets increasingly animated, and Gus&#x27;s questions become more pointed, at times nearly nonsensical.

In the back of the room is a dumbwaiter, which delivers occasional food orders. This is mysterious and both characters seem to be puzzled why these orders keep coming; the basement is clearly not outfitted as a restaurant kitchen. At one point they send up some snack food that Gus had brought along. Ben has to explain to the people above via the dumbwaiter&#x27;s &quot;speaking tube&quot; that there is no food.

Gus leaves the room to get a drink of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter&#x27;s speaking tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and is on his way to the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain falls.

==Title==
The dumb waiter of the title refers to the serving hatch and food lift that delivers orders to the gunmen. It could also refer to Gus, who fails to realise that he is waiting to be the victim, or even to Ben, whose obedience to a higher authority eventually forces him to eliminate his partner.

==Setting==
The windowless basement is characteristic of Pinter&#x27;s sets. &quot;Pinter&#x27;s rooms are stuffy, non-specific cubes, whose atmosphere grows steadily more stale and more tense. At the opening curtain these rooms look naturalistic, meaning no more than the eye can contain. But, by the end of each play, they become sealed containers, virtual coffins.&quot;

==Style==
Pinter&#x27;s writing in &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot; combines &quot;the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk and the urban thriller&quot;. The dialogue between Ben and Gus, while seemingly concerned only with trivial newspaper stories, football matches and cups of tea, reveals their characters. In Pinter&#x27;s early plays, &quot;it is language that betrays the villains – more pat, more cliché-ridden, with more brute power than that of their victims&quot;.

In the theatre, the emotional power of the play is more readily felt than understood. Pinter &quot;created his own theatrical grammar – he didn&#x27;t merely write characters that had an emotional response to something... But instead, through his characters&#x27; interactions and phrasings, Pinter seemed to conjure the very visceral emotion itself&quot;.

==Interpretation==
Although the play is realistic in many ways, particularly the dialogue between Ben and Gus, there are also elements that are unexplained and seemingly absurd, particularly the messages delivered by the dumb waiter itself, and the delivery of an envelope containing twelve matchsticks. Pinter leaves the play open to interpretation, &quot;wanting his audience to complete his plays, to resolve in their own ways these irresolvable matters&quot;. Pinter stated that &quot;between my lack of biographical data about [the characters] and the ambiguity of what they say lies a territory which is not only worthy of exploration but which it is compulsory to explore&quot;.

One interpretation is that the play is an absurdist comedy about two men waiting in a universe without meaning or purpose, like Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. &quot;The Dumb Waiter... achieves, through its unique blend of absurdity, farce, and surface realism, a profoundly moving statement about the modern human condition&quot;.

Another interpretation is that the play is a political drama showing how the individual is destroyed by a higher power. &quot;Each of Harold Pinter&#x27;s [first] four plays ends in the virtual annihilation of an individual... It is by his bitter dramas of dehumanisation that he implies &quot;the importance of humanity&quot;. The religion and society, which have traditionally structured human morality, are, in Pinter&#x27;s plays, the immoral agents that destroy the individual.&quot; Pinter supported the interpretation of &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; and &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot; as &quot;political plays about power and victimisation&quot;.

Overall, &quot;it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership. Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority and a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, talking past each other and raking over old times&quot;. It is &quot;a strongly political play about the way a hierarchical society, in pitting the rebel against the conformist, places both at its mercy&quot;, but at the same time &quot;a deeply personal play about the destructiveness of betrayal&quot;.

&quot;For an audience to gaze into Ben and Gus&#x27; closed basement room and overhear their everyday prattle is to gain insight into ... the terrifying vision of the dominant-subservient battle for power, a battle in which societies and individuals engage as a part of daily existence&quot;.

==Comedy==
Although the play uses &quot;the semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music hall comedy&quot; and is generally considered funny, this is not comedy for its own sake, but &quot;a crucial part of the power-structure&quot;.

&quot;The comedy routines in the early plays are maps to the themes and meaning of the plays as a whole... Our failure to laugh may be an indication that we, the audience, have come to side (or have been taught to side) with the victim rather than the victimiser.&quot;

The stories Ben picks out from his newspaper have a similar purpose. He describes an old man, wanting to cross the street, who crawls under a lorry and is run over by it (but it is not clear if the man is killed or not). Ben seems to expect the response, &quot;What an idiot!&quot; but Gus replies &quot;Who advised him to do a thing like that?&quot; which shifts responsibility and suggests the old man was a victim to be pitied. &quot;The eventual split between Ben and Gus is foreshadowed in the very first joke... By the end of the play, Pinter has trained us to see that the content of the joke-exchange is meaningless: what is important is the structure, and the alliances and antagonisms it reveals.&quot;

==Reception==

Harry Derbyshire reviewed the play in &quot;Modern Drama&quot;, concluding &quot;Small but perfectly formed, &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot; might be considered the best of Harold Pinter&#x27;s early plays, more consistent than &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; and sharper than &quot;The Caretaker&quot;. It combines the classic characteristics of early Pinter – a paucity of information and an atmosphere of menace, working-class small-talk in a claustrophobic setting – with an oblique but palpable political edge and, in so doing, can be seen as containing the germ of Pinter&#x27;s entire dramatic oeuvre&quot;.

Jamie Glover wrote that &quot;&quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot; is Pinter distilled – the very essence of a writer who tapped into our desire to seek out meaning, confront injustice and assert our individuality.&quot;

* In Bruges (2008) is a black comedy, crime thriller directed and written by Martin McDonagh which also features two hitmen waiting in confinement for instructions from their mob boss after they accidentally killed a young boy during their last assassination. Neither of them understand why they have been sent to Bruges, since they could easily be kept hidden in the UK — the older man, Ken, who has a close relationship with the boss, speculates that they might be here not just to hide from the police but also to kill another person. Ken is calm and enjoys the opportunity to do some sightseeing in Bruges while waiting for their orders, while the younger man, Ray, is emotionally volatile, swinging between boredom and severe guilt at shooting the young boy. While the two men await their orders they argue and one of them bemoans their circumstances. Eventually the boss calls, asks Ken to send Ray out of the room, and then informs him that the trip to Bruges was intended to be a farewell gift for Ray, who he must now assassinate as justice for killing the young boy.

<doc id="311244" wikidata="Q17097869" url="?curid=311244" title="Tally (voting)">
<text>A tally is an unofficial private observation of an election count carried out under the single transferable vote electoral system. &quot;Tallymen&quot;, appointed by political candidates and parties, observe the opening of ballot boxes and watch as the individual ballot papers are counted. Individual tallymen may be placed to observe the opening of each box and watch as separate bundles of ballot papers are sorted, stacked and counted. They record their estimation of counts by marking votes for each candidate on their &#x27;tally sheet&#x27; as a tick (/) which are then assembled together to produce a full prediction of what the likely outcome of the result will be. Many political parties, having been rival during elections, co-operate in producing a tally.

Tally results are then released to the media before a &quot;formal&quot; account may even have begun, allowing predictions as to how some, or in most cases all, the seats in multi-member constituencies, may go hours in advance of the official count, by noting how many number &quot;1&quot;s a candidate may get, who gets their number &quot;2&quot;s, whether voters vote for one party or spread their first, second, third, fourth etc. preferences randomly, by party, by alphabet, by local area, or by some other criteria. In the Republic of Ireland, a national prediction of an election outcome may be made on RTÉ by lunchtime on count day, before a single seat has officially been filled.

Tally results are used after the elections by political parties to work out, on the basis of from which ballot box the tally came, how many votes they picked up in a particular area, or even a particular street. The planned introduction in the Republic of Ireland of electronic voting for the 2004 local elections was expected to lead to the demise of the tally system. However, widespread criticism of the electronic voting programme has meant that a hand-count remains in operation in Ireland. Tally predictions and long complex counts have given election outcomes on television and radio much of their appeal, making election results coverage, which may last from 15 hours to days, depending on the closeness of an election, producing a form of &quot;spectator sport&quot; watched by vast viewerships.

<doc id="311245" wikidata="Q14714" url="?curid=311245" title="Achene">
<text>An achene (; ), also sometimes called akene and occasionally achenium or achenocarp, is a type of simple dry fruit produced by many species of flowering plants. Achenes are monocarpellate (formed from one carpel) and indehiscent (they do not open at maturity). Achenes contain a single seed that nearly fills the pericarp, but does not adhere to it. In many species, what is called the &quot;seed&quot; is an achene, a fruit containing the seed. The seed-like appearance is owed to the hardening of the fruit wall (pericarp), which encloses the solitary seed so closely as to seem like a seed coat.

==Examples==
The fruits of buttercup, buckwheat, caraway, quinoa, amaranth, and cannabis are typical achenes.

The achenes of the strawberry are sometimes mistaken for seeds. The strawberry is an accessory fruit with an aggregate of achenes on its outer surface, and what is eaten is accessory tissue.

A rose produces an aggregate of achene fruits that are encompassed within an expanded hypanthium (aka floral tube), which is a structure where basal portions of the calyx, the corolla, and the stamens unite with the receptacle to form a cup-shaped tube.

==Variations==
A winged achene, as in maple, is called a samara.

Some achenes have accessory hair-like structures that cause them to tumble in the wind in a manner similar to a tumbleweed. This type sometimes is called a tumble fruit or diaspore. An example is &quot;Anemone virginiana&quot;.

A caryopsis or grain is a type of fruit that closely resembles an achene, but differs in that the pericarp is fused to the thin seed coat in the grain.

An utricle is like an achene, but the fruit is bladder-like or inflated.

Fruits of sedges are sometimes considered achenes although their one-locule ovary is a compound ovary.
The fruit of the family Asteraceae is also so similar to an achene that it is often considered to be one, although it derives from a compound inferior ovary (with one locule). A special term for the Asteraceae fruit is cypsela (plural cypselae or cypselas). For example, the white-gray husks of a sunflower &quot;seed&quot; are the walls of the cypsela fruit. Many cypselas (e.g. dandelion) have modified calyx tissue called pappi attached that functions in biological dispersal of the seed.

<doc id="311247" wikidata="Q202167" url="?curid=311247" title="Cohort (military unit)">
<text>A cohort (from the Latin &quot;cohors&quot;, : &quot;cohortes&quot;; see for full inflection table) was a standard tactical military unit of a Roman legion. Although the standard size changed with time and situation, it was generally composed of 480 soldiers. A cohort is considered to be the equivalent of a modern military battalion. The cohort replaced the maniple. From the late second century BC and until the middle of the third century AD, ten cohorts (about 5,000 men total) made up a legion. Cohorts were named &quot;first cohort&quot;, &quot;second cohort&quot;, etc. The first cohort consisted of experienced legionaries, while the legionaries in the tenth cohort were less experienced.

==Legionary cohort==
A legionary cohort of the early empire consisted of six &quot;centuriae&quot;, or centuries, each consisting of 80 legionaries, for a total of 480 legionaries. Early in the Republic, each &quot;centuria&quot; consisted of 100 men, hence their name. Each &quot;centuria&quot; was commanded by a centurion, who increased in seniority from the sixth to the first centuries; thus, the centurion of the sixth century was the most junior in the cohort, while the centurion of the first century was the most senior. In order of increasing seniority, the six centurions were titled &quot;hastatus posterior&quot;, &quot;hastatus prior&quot;, &quot;princeps posterior&quot;, &quot;princeps prior&quot;, &quot;pilus posterior&quot;, and &quot;pilus prior&quot;. The &quot;pilus prior&quot; would command the cohort overall. The nomenclature of the ranks was derived from the Republican &quot;manipular&quot; legions, where troops were grouped into three rankings; &quot;hastati&quot; for the most inexperienced, followed by &quot;principes&quot;, and finally &quot;triarii&quot; for the most experienced. &quot;Pilus&quot; was a name for a maniple of triarii, reflecting their use as spearmen, &quot;pilum&quot; being the Latin word for a javelin.

A century of 80 men was divided into ten &quot;contubernia&quot;, each of eight men, who shared a single A-frame tent together. A contubernium was led by a decanus, appointed from within the contubernium, and was most likely the longest-serving legionary of the eight. The decanus organised the erection of the unit&#x27;s marching tent, and ensured his tent-mates kept things tidy. A contubernium was assigned one to two pack mules, which would carry heavier equipment and the contubernium&#x27;s mill, for grinding their daily grain ration into flour. These duties would be carried out by camp slaves, of which one to two would be assigned to each contubernium. They tended to the pack mule, ensured legionaries had water on the march, and camp duties such as cooking, washing, and other specialised skills such as smithing or carpentry. While encamped, younger legionaries may be sent out to fetch fodder, firewood, and water for the contubernium. 

A century of 80 men would be commanded by a centurion, assisted by four junior officers. The pay of a centurion fluctuated depending on their seniority; the most junior centurion in a legion received around ten times the standard rate of pay, while the most senior legionary centurion could receive some forty times the standard rate of pay. The centurion was assisted by an optio, who served as his second-in-command, and typically received double the legionary rate of pay. Third in seniority was a tesserarius, who exercised command over the nightly guard duties, and were responsible for distributing the watchwords for the camp. A tesserarius was typically paid one-and-a-half times the standard rate of pay. A century also had a signifer, who carried the century&#x27;s standard into battle, and also served as the unit&#x27;s treasurer, keeping track of the pay and expenses of the men. Signifers typically received double pay. Lastly, a cornicen, equipped with a cornu, served as a signaller, and received double pay. These officers would have their own support staff, tents, and mules. Thus, a cohort would consist of, on paper, 480 legionaries, 6 centurions, and 24 junior officers, with logistical support provided by 60-120 slaves, and 60-120 mules. 

Ten cohorts of 480 legionaries would comprise a legion. Like the ranks of the centurions, cohorts would also follow a pattern of seniority; a legion&#x27;s tenth cohort was its most junior, while the first cohort was the most prestigious, with its ranks filled with either veteran troops, or the best recruits. The commander of the first cohort&#x27;s first century was known as the primus pilus or &quot;primipilus&quot;, a legion&#x27;s most senior centurion. The &quot;primus pilus&quot; was eligible for promotion to &quot;praefectus castrorum&quot; or camp prefect, the third most senior officer in a legion, responsible for the day-to-day administration of a legion. 

The first cohort was an aberration in that it consisted of five double-strength &quot;centuriae&quot;, each of 160 men, for a total of 800 men, as opposed to six centuries of 80 men. It was the unique honour of the first cohort&#x27;s aquilifer to carry the legion&#x27;s &quot;aquila&quot;, or eagle, standard into battle, which possessed a quasi-religious importance to the legionaries. Loss of an eagle was considered a mark of extreme shame and disgrace for a legion. A legion&#x27;s first cohort also had an imaginifer, who carried an &quot;imago&quot; of the reigning Emperor, typically a three-dimensional relief of their likeness made of beaten metal.

Each cohort also had a small artillery corps. According to Vegetius, a 4th-century Roman author, each century was equipped with a &quot;scorpio&quot;, a small torsion-powered ballista, for a total of six per cohort. A contubernium would be deputed to operate the weapon, when required. Like most ancient artillery, these weapons were likely used in fixed positions for infantry defence, or in sieges. Each cohort also had one &quot;onager&quot;, a stone-throwing torsion-powered catapult. Vegetius stipulates that they were transported fully-assembled on ox-drawn carts, to ensure the onager was ready for immediate use. Additional equipment, such as rams, towers, or larger ballistae were added as needed. Thus, by extrapolation, a legion had an artillery train of some sixty &quot;scorpios&quot; and ten &quot;onagers&quot;.

==Types of cohort==
*&quot;Cohors alaria&quot;: allied or auxiliary unit
*&quot;Cohors quinquagenaria&quot;: auxiliary, nominally 500 strong
*&quot;Cohors milliaria&quot;: auxiliary, nominally 1000 strong
*&quot;Cohors classica&quot;: auxiliary unit originally formed of sailors and marines
*&quot;Cohors equitata&quot; (LA): unit of auxiliary infantry with attached mounted squadrons
*&quot;Cohors peditata&quot; (LA): infantry unit
*&quot;Cohors sagittaria&quot;: infantry auxiliary unit of bowmen
*&quot;Cohors speculatorum&quot; (LA): guard unit of Mark Antony composed of scouts
*&quot;Cohors torquata&quot; (LA): auxiliary unit granted a &quot;torques&quot; (military decoration)
*&quot;Cohors tumultuaria&quot; (from &quot;tumultus&quot;, &quot;chaos&quot;): irregular auxiliary unit

==Other Roman cohorts==
Although not part of a legion, some paramilitary corps in Rome consisted of one or more cohorts:
*The nine &quot;cohortes praetoriae&quot;, never grouped to a legion, the Praetorians. The term was first used to refer to the bodyguard of a general during the Republic; later, a unit of imperial guards (temporarily restyled &quot;cohors palatina&quot; (imperial cohort), c. 300 AD, under Diocletian&#x27;s tetrarchy).
**&quot;Cohors togata&quot; was a unit of the Praetorian Guard in civilian clothes tasked with duties within the &quot;pomerium&quot; (sacred center of the capital, where all armed forces were forbidden).
*&quot;Cohortes urbanae&quot;, &quot;urban cohort&quot;: Law enforcement officers patrolling in the capital, led by the &quot;Praefectus urbanus&quot;, or &quot;urban prefect&quot;.
*&quot;Cohortes vigilum&quot;, &quot;watchmen&quot;: Law enforcement officers forming the fire brigade in the capital, led by the &quot;Praefectus vigilum&quot;, or &quot;prefect of the watchmen&quot;.
*&quot;Cohors Germanorum&quot; (LA): the unit of &quot;Germani custodes corporis&quot; (imperial body guards recruited in Germania).

Furthermore, the Latin word &quot;cohors&quot; was used in a looser way to describe a rather large &quot;company&quot; of people (see, for instance, &quot;cohors amicorum&quot;).

<doc id="311254" wikidata="Q209522" url="?curid=311254" title="Binge eating disorder">
<text>Binge eating disorder (BED) is an eating disorder characterized by frequent and recurrent binge eating episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without the compensatory behaviors common to bulimia nervosa, OSFED, or the binge-purge subtype of anorexia nervosa.

BED is a recently described condition, which was required to distinguish binge eating similar to that seen in bulimia nervosa but without characteristic purging. Individuals who are diagnosed with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder exhibit similar patterns of compulsive overeating, neurobiological features of dysfunctional cognitive control and food addiction, and biological and environmental risk factors. Some professionals consider BED to be a milder form of bulimia with the two conditions on the same spectrum.

Binge eating is one of the most prevalent eating disorders among adults, though there tends to be less media coverage and research about the disorder in comparison to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

==Signs and symptoms==

Binge eating is the core symptom of BED; however, not everyone who binge eats has BED. An individual may occasionally binge eat without experiencing many of the negative physical, psychological, or social effects of BED. This may be considered disordered eating rather than a clinical disorder. Precisely defining binge eating can be problematic, however, binge eating episodes in BED are generally described as having the following potential features:
* Eating much faster than normal, perhaps in a short space of time
* Eating until feeling uncomfortably full
* Eating a large amount when not hungry
* Subjective loss of control over how much or what is eaten
* Planning and allocating specific times for binging
* Eating alone or secretly
* Not being able to remember what was eaten after the binge
* Feelings of guilt, shame or disgust following a food binge
* Body image disturbance

In contrast to bulimia nervosa, binge eating episodes are not regularly followed by activities intended to compensate for the amount of food consumed, such as self-induced vomiting, laxative or enema misuse, or strenuous exercise. BED is characterized more by overeating than dietary restriction. Those with BED often have poor body image and frequently diet, but are unsuccessful due to the severity of their binge eating.

Obesity is common in persons with BED, as is depression, low self-esteem, stress and boredom. Regarding cognitive abilities, individuals showing severe binge eating symptoms may experience small dysfunctions in executive functions. Those with BED are also at risk of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, menstrual irregularities such as amenorrhea, and gastrointestinal problems such as acid reflux and heartburn.

== Causes ==

As with other eating disorders, binge eating is an &quot;expressive disorder&quot;—a disorder that is an expression of deeper psychological problems. People who have binge eating disorder have been found to have higher weight bias internalization, which includes low self-esteem, unhealthy eating patterns, and general body dissatisfaction. Binge eating disorder commonly develops as a result or side effect of depression, as it is common for people to turn to comfort foods when they are feeling down.

There was resistance to give binge eating disorder the status of a fully fledged eating disorder because many perceived binge eating disorder to be caused by individual choices. Previous research has focused on the relationship between body image and eating disorders, and concludes that disordered eating might be linked to rigid dieting practices. In the majority of cases of anorexia, extreme and inflexible restriction of dietary intake leads at some point to the development of binge eating, weight regain, bulimia nervosa, or a mixed form of eating disorder not otherwise specified. When under a strict diet that mimics the effects of starvation, the body may be preparing for a new type of behavior pattern, one that consumes a large amount of food in a relatively short period of time.

Some studies show that BED aggregates in families and could be genetic. However, very few published studies around the genetics exist.

However, other research suggests that binge eating disorder can also be caused by environmental factors and the impact of traumatic events. One study showed that women with binge eating disorder experienced more adverse life events in the year prior to the onset of the development of the disorder, and that binge eating disorder was positively associated with how frequently negative events occur. Additionally, the research found that individuals who had binge eating disorder were more likely to have experienced physical abuse, perceived risk of physical abuse, stress, and body criticism. Other risk factors may include childhood obesity, critical comments about weight, low self-esteem, depression, and physical or sexual abuse in childhood. A systematic review concluded that bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are impacted by family separations, a loss in their lives, and negative parent-child interactions A few studies have suggested that there could be a genetic component to binge eating disorder, though other studies have shown more ambiguous results. Studies have shown that binge eating tends to run in families and a twin study by Bulik, Sullivan, and Kendler has shown a, &quot;moderate heritability for binge eating&quot; at 41 percent. Studies have also shown that eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia reduce coping abilities, which makes it more likely for those suffering to turn to binge eating as a coping strategy.

&quot;In the U.S, it is estimated that 3.5% of young women and 30% to 40% of people who seek weight loss treatments, can be clinically diagnosed with binge eating disorder.&quot;

==Diagnosis==
===International Classification of Diseases===
The 2017 update to the American version of the ICD-10 includes BED under F50.81. ICD-11 may contain a dedicated entry (6B62), defining BED as frequent, recurrent episodes of binge eating (once a week or more over a period of several months) which are not regularly followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors aimed at preventing weight gain.

According to the World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-11 classification of BED, the severity of the disorder can be classified as mild (1-3 episodes/week), moderate (4-7 episodes/week), severe (8-13 episodes/week) and extreme (&gt;14 episodes/week).

===Diagnostic and Statistical Manual===
Initially considered a topic for further research exploration, binge eating disorder was first included in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)&quot; in 1994 simply as a feature of eating disorder. In 2013 it gained formal recognition as a psychiatric condition in the DSM-5. Until 2013, binge eating disorder was categorized as an Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, an umbrella category for eating disorders that don&#x27;t fall under the categories for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Prior to DSM-5, Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, which included BED, was diagnosed more often than both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Because it was not a recognized psychiatric disorder in the DSM until 2013, it has been difficult to obtain insurance reimbursement for treatments. The disorder now has its own category under &quot;DSM-5&quot;, which outlines the signs and symptoms that must be present to classify a person&#x27;s behavior as binge eating disorder. Studies have confirmed the high predictive value of these criteria for diagnosing BED.

One study claims that the method for diagnosing BED is for a clinician to conduct a structured interview using the DSM-5 criteria or taking the Eating Disorder Examination. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID-5) takes no more than 75 minutes to complete and has a systematic approach which follows the DSM-5 criteria. The Eating Disorder Examination is a semi-structured interview that identifies the frequency of binges and associated eating disorder features.

The DSM-5 characterizes diagnosis under several categories—mild, moderate, severe, and extreme—each determined by the number of binges the patient exhibits per week.
Mild: 1-3 episodes per week, Moderate: 4-7 episodes per week, Severe: 8-13 episodes per week, Extreme: 14 or more episodes per week

Further, the remission states are classified under the following.
Partial Remission: Following a previous diagnosis, the average frequency of binge eating episodes decreases to less than one episode per week for a sustained period of time.
Full Remission: Following a previous diagnosis, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.

== Management ==
Counselling and some medication, such as certain stimulants (e.g. lisdexamfetamine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and GLP-1 receptor agonists, may help those affected by BED. Some recommend a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of the disorder.

=== Medication ===

==== Lisdexamfetamine ====

As of July 2024, lisdexamfetamine is the only pharmacotherapy approved by the USFDA and TGA for BED Evidence indicates that its efficacy in treating BED may be partially attributed to a psychopathological overlap with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a cognitive control disorder that also benefits from treatment with lisdexamfetamine.

Medical reviews of randomized controlled trials have established that lisdexamfetamine, administered at doses between 50 and 70 mg, is safe and effective for treating BED. These reviews consistently report significant reductions in the number of binge eating days and episodes per week. Furthermore, a meta-analytic systematic review highlighted a 12-month extension study demonstrating that lisdexamfetamine maintained its effectiveness in reducing binge eating days throughout the study duration. Two reviews have found lisdexamfetamine to be superior to placebo in several secondary outcomes, including persistent binge eating cessation, reduction of obsessive-compulsive binge eating symptoms, body weight, and triglycerides.

Lisdexamfetamine is a pharmacologically inert prodrug that confers its therapeutic effects for BED after conversion to its active metabolite, dextroamphetamine, which acts in the central nervous system. Dextroamphetamine increases the activity of dopamine and norepinephrine in prefrontal cortical regions that regulate cognitive control of behavior. By enhancing the ability to exert cognitive control over behavior, dextroamphetamine helps patients with BED override prepotent feeding responses that precede binge eating episodes. Lisdexamfetamine, like all pharmaceutical amphetamines, possesses direct appetite suppressant effects, which may be therapeutically beneficial for BED and its associated comorbidities. Neuroimaging studies involving BED-diagnosed participants suggest that long-term neuroadaptations in dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems resulting from lisdexamfetamine treatment may play a role in the sustained improvements in eating behavior regulation observed even after discontinuation of the drug.

==== Off-label medications ====
Three other classes of medications are also used in the treatment of binge eating disorder: antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and anti-obesity medications. Antidepressant medications of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) have been found to effectively reduce episodes of binge eating and reduce weight. Similarly, anticonvulsant medications such as topiramate and zonisamide may be able to effectively suppress appetite. The long-term effectiveness of medication for binge eating disorder is currently unknown. For BED patients with manic episodes, risperidone is recommended. If BED patients have bipolar depression, lamotrigine is appropriate to use.

Trials of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and anti-obesity medications suggest that these medications are superior to placebo in reducing binge eating. Medications are not considered the treatment of choice because psychotherapeutic approaches, such as CBT, are more effective than medications for binge eating disorder. A meta-analysis concluded that using medications did not reduce binge-eating episodes and BMI posttreatment at 6–12 months. This indicates a potential possibility of relapse after withdrawal from the medications. Medications also do not increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy, though some patients may benefit from anticonvulsant and anti-obesity medications, such as phentermine/topiramate, for weight loss.

Blocking opioid receptors leads to less food intake. Additionally, bupropion and naltrexone used together may cause weight loss. Combining these alongside psychotherapies like CBT may lead to better outcomes for BED.

GLP-1 receptor agonist medications such as semaglutide (Ozempic), dulaglutide (Trulicity), and liraglutide (Saxenda) have been used for treating BED in recent years. Often prescribed for lowering appetite and subsequent weight loss in obese and diabetic patients, they can successfully stop or reduce obsessive thoughts about food, binging urges, and other impulsive behaviors. Some users of these drugs have reported a major, sudden improvement in what is colloquially known as &quot;food noise&quot; – constant, unstoppable thoughts about eating despite not being physically hungry – which can be a symptom of BED. This is a promising treatment, however more research is needed as of January 2024.

===Counselling===
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment has been demonstrated as a more effective form of treatment for BED than behavioral weight loss programs. 50% of BED individuals achieve complete remission from binge eating and 68-90% will reduce the amount of binge eating episodes they have. CBT has also been shown to be an effective method to address self-image issues and psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., depression) associated with the disorder. The goal of CBT is to interrupt binge-eating behaviour, learn to create a normal eating schedule, change the perception around weight and shape and develop positive attitudes about one&#x27;s body. Although this treatment is successful in eliminating binge eating episodes, it does not lead to losing any weight. Recent reviews have concluded that psychological interventions such as psychotherapy and behavioral interventions are more effective than pharmacological interventions for the treatment of binge eating disorder. A meta-analysis concluded that psychotherapy based on CBT not only significantly improved binge-eating symptomatology but also reduced a client&#x27;s BMI significantly at posttreatment and longer than 6 and 12 months after treatment. Behavioral weight loss treatment has been proven to be effective as a means to achieve weight loss amongst patients.

===Surgery===
Bariatric surgery has also been proposed as another approach to treat BED and a recent meta-analysis showed that approximately two-thirds of individuals who seek this type of surgery for weight loss purposes have BED. Bariatric surgery recipients who had BED prior to receiving the surgery tend to have poorer weight-loss outcomes and are more likely to continue to exhibit eating behaviors characteristic of BED.

=== Lifestyle interventions ===
Other treatments for BED include lifestyle interventions like weight training, peer support groups, and investigation of hormonal abnormalities.

==Prognosis==
Individuals with BED often have a lower overall quality of life and commonly experience social difficulties. Early behavior change is an accurate prediction of remission of symptoms later.

Individuals who have BED commonly have other comorbidities such as major depressive disorder, personality disorder, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, body dysmorphic disorder, kleptomania, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or an anxiety disorder. Individuals may also exhibit varying degrees of panic attacks and a history of attempted suicide.

While people of a normal weight may overeat occasionally, an ongoing habit of consuming large amounts of food in a short period of time may ultimately lead to weight gain and obesity. The main physical health consequences of this type of eating disorder are brought on by the weight gain resulting from calorie-laden bingeing episodes. Mental and emotional consequences of binge eating disorder include social weight stigma and emotional loss of control. Up to 70% of individuals with BED may also be obese, and therefore obesity-associated morbidities such as high blood pressure and coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal issues (e.g., gallbladder disease), high cholesterol levels, musculoskeletal problems and obstructive sleep apnea may also be present. One study found a 42% obesity rate in those who have received a BED diagnosis. Additionally, a higher morbid obesity prevalence was observed in this population compared to a population without eating disorders.

==Epidemiology==
=== General ===
The prevalence of BED in the general population is approximately 1-3%.

BED cases usually occur between the ages of 12.4 and 24.7, but prevalence rates increase until the age of 40.

=== Age ===
Binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in adults.

The limited amount of research that has been done on BED shows that rates of binge eating disorder are fairly comparable among men and women. The lifetime prevalence of binge eating disorder has been observed in studies to be 2.0 percent for men and 3.5 percent for women, higher than that of the commonly recognized eating disorders anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. However another systematic literature review found the prevalence average to be about 2.3% in women and about 0.3% in men. Lifetime prevalence rates for BED in women can range anywhere from 1.5 to 6 times higher than in men. One literature review found that point prevalence rates for BED vary from 0.1 percent to 24.1 percent depending on the sample. This same review also found that the 12-month prevalence rates vary between 0.1 percent to 8.8 percent. Adolescents also face a notable risk of binge eating behavior. Incidents rates of 10.1 and 6.6 per 10,000 person years have been observed in male and female adolescents in the U.S., respectively.

=== Sexuality ===
Recent studies found that eating disorders which included anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are common among sexual and gender minority populations, including gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. This could be due to the stress and discrimination this population experiences. Furthermore, adolescent and young adult sexual minority males binge at higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts.

=== Race and ethnicity ===
Due to limited and inconsistent information and research on ethnic and racial differences, prevalence rates are hard to determine for BED. However, the racial makeup of BED distinctly varies from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Rates of binge eating disorder have been found to be similar among black women, white women, and white men, while some studies have shown that binge eating disorder is more common among black women than among white women. However, majority of the research done around BED is focused on White women. One literature review found information citing no difference between BED prevalence among Hispanic, African American, and White women while other information found that BED prevalence was highest among Hispanics followed by Black individuals and finally White people. A 2021 study has observed &quot;higher rates of BED as compared to other ethnic groups&quot; for African Americans. The likelihood of reporting eating disorder symptoms is also lower in some groups, including African Americans. Asian-Americans also face decreased reporting of ED symptoms. This can be partly attributed to &quot;significantly higher thin ideal internalization&quot; compared to other ethnic groups.

Migration can also influence BED risk. Mexican-American immigrants have been observed to face a greater risk of BED following migration.

=== Socioeconomic status ===
Individuals with low socioeconomic status often face many barriers in the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders like BED. These barriers include longer clinical waiting times, worse care, and less clinical investigation for individuals that &quot;defy illness stereotypes&quot;. The costs associated with specialized mental health care pose another barrier for low socioeconomic status individuals. Furthermore, associated factors such as food insecurity and environmental stress have been shown to contribute to higher rates of eating disorders, such as BED, in these populations. Food security has been found to be a notable predictor of eating disorder behaviors. Low food security has been shown to increase the prevalence and frequency of binge eating. Researchers have been called on to reframe eating-related disorders to better fit low socioeconomic status populations and improve future investigations.

=== Worldwide Prevalences ===
Contrary to historical beliefs, BED is not limited to Western societies. Evidence of increasing eating disorder prevalence has been observed in &quot;non-Western countries and among ethnic minorities&quot;. Though the research on binge eating disorders tends to be concentrated in North America, the disorder occurs across cultures. Increasing globalization has influenced the prevalence of eating disorders outside of the West. In the US, BED is present in 0.8% of male adults and 1.6% of female adults in a given year.

The prevalence of BED is lower in Nordic countries compared to Europe in a study that included Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland. The point prevalence ranged from 0.4 to 1.5 percent and the lifetime prevalence ranged from 0.7 to 5.8 percent for BED in women.

In a study that included Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, the point prevalence for BED was 3.53 percent. Therefore, this particular study found that the prevalence for BED is higher in these Latin American countries compared to Western countries.

The prevalence of BED in Europe ranges from &lt;1 to 4 percent.

=== Co-morbidities ===
BED is co-morbid with diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke, and heart disease in some individuals.

In people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder or bipolar I or II disorders, BED lifetime prevalence was found to be higher.

Additionally, 30 to 40 percent of individuals seeking treatment for weight-loss can be diagnosed with binge eating disorder.

=== Underreporting in men ===
Eating disorders are oftentimes underreported in men. Underreporting could be a result of measurement bias due to how eating disorders are defined. The current definition for eating disorders focuses on thinness. However, eating disorders in men tend to center on muscularity and would therefore warrant a need for a different measurement definition. Overvaluation rates of body weight or shape in adolescent males is significantly lower than their female counterpart (4.9% and 24.2%, respectively). Little is known if this discrepancy is an indicator of later onset of body image distortion in males or a consequence of female-centric diagnostic frameworks for eating disorders.

The lack of representation of men in eating disorder research has been hindered by historical perceptions of eating disorders as a &quot;female phenomenon&quot;. Researchers have been called on to address this gap by advancing methods of &quot;identification, assessment, classification, and treatment&quot; for eating disorders in a male-specific context, specifically in young men.

== Frequency ==
BED is the most common eating disorder, with 47% of people with eating disorders have BED, 3% of them have anorexia nervosa and 12% of them have bulimia nervosa. Over 57% of people with BED are female and it often begins in the late teens or early 20s.

==History==
The disorder was first described in 1959 by psychiatrist and researcher Albert Stunkard as &quot;night eating syndrome&quot; (NES). The term &quot;binge eating&quot; was coined to describe the same bingeing-type eating behavior but without the exclusive nocturnal component.

There is generally less research on binge eating disorder in comparison to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

<text>Legion is a computer software system variously classified as a distributed operating system, a peer-to-peer system, metacomputing software, and middleware. It is an object-based system designed to provide secure, transparent access to large numbers of machines, both to computational power and data.

The project was funded by the National Science Foundation and other funding agencies, and was mostly developed at the University of Virginia by a group led by Andrew Grimshaw. The Legion people formed the Avaki Corporation to commercialize the project in 1999, but Avaki eventually abandoned the Legion software base, and finally went bankrupt in 2005, with its intellectual property acquired by Sybase.

Legion is the successor to Hydra, developed to run on the C.mmp hardware system developed at Carnegie Mellon University in the late 1960s.

One of the slogans of the Legion project is &quot;mechanism, not policy!&quot;

<text>is a Japanese animator, filmmaker and actor. His most celebrated creation, the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise, has had a significant influence on the anime television industry and Japanese popular culture. Anno&#x27;s style is defined by his postmodernist approach and the extensive portrayal of characters&#x27; thoughts and emotions.

Anno&#x27;s other directorial works include &quot;Daicon Film&#x27;s Return of Ultraman&quot; (1983), &quot;Gunbuster&quot; (1988), &quot;&quot; (1990), &quot;Kare Kano&quot; (1998), &quot;Love &amp; Pop&quot; (1998), &quot;Shiki-Jitsu&quot; (2000), &quot;Cutie Honey&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; (2007–2021), and &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot; (2016), with the latter film marking the beginning of the &quot;Shin&quot; trilogy of &quot;tokusatsu&quot; franchise reboots, followed by &quot;Shin Ultraman&quot; (2022) and &quot;Shin Kamen Rider&quot; (2023). Several of Anno&#x27;s anime have won the &quot;Animage&quot; Anime Grand Prix award, including &quot;Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water&quot; in 1990, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; in 1995 and 1996, and &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; in 1997.

==Biography==

===Childhood and early education===
The son of Fumiko and Takuya Anno, Anno was born in Ube, Yamaguchi; he attended Wakō Kindergarten, Unoshima Municipal Elementary School, Fujiyama Municipal Junior High School, and Yamaguchi Prefectural Ube High School where he was noted for his interest in artwork and making short films for Japanese Cultural Festivals.

===Early work===
Anno began his career while attending Osaka University of Arts as an animator for the anime series &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; (1982–1983). Wrapped up in producing the &quot;DAICON III and IV Opening Animations&quot; with his fellow students, and also busy making self-financed films, Anno stopped paying his tuition, eventually getting expelled from Osaka University of Arts. He did not gain recognition until the release of his work on Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. Running short on animators, the film&#x27;s production studio posted an ad in the famous Japanese animation magazine Animage, announcing that they were in desperate need of more animators. Anno, in his early twenties at the time, read the ad and headed down to the film&#x27;s studio, where he met with Miyazaki and showed him some of his drawings. Impressed with his ability, Miyazaki hired him to draw some of the most complicated scenes near the end of the movie, and valued his work highly.

Anno went on to become one of the co-founders of Gainax in December 1984. He worked as an animation director for their first feature-length film, &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise&quot; (1987), and ultimately became Gainax&#x27;s premiere anime director, leading the majority of the studio&#x27;s projects such as &quot;Gunbuster&quot; (1988) and &quot;&quot; (1990–1991). However, Anno fell into a four-year depression following &quot;Nadia&quot; — the series was handed down to him from NHK from an original concept by Hayao Miyazaki (of which &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; is also partly based upon) and he was given little creative control. In 1994, the minor planet 9081 Hideakianno was named after him by his old friend Akimasa Nakamura.

===&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;===

Anno&#x27;s next project was the anime television series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; (1995–1996). The series is set in a post-apocalyptic futurist version of Tokyo and follows humanity&#x27;s struggle to survive against an onslaught of giant monsters known as Angels. Anno&#x27;s history of clinical depression was the main source for the emphasis on the psychological aspects of its characters, as he wrote down on paper several of the trials and tribulations of his condition. For this and other reasons (although perhaps by design as well), &quot;Evangelion&quot;″s plot became more introspective as the series progressed, despite being broadcast in a children&#x27;s television timeslot. Anno felt that people should be exposed to the realities of life at as young an age as possible, and by the end of the series all attempts at traditional narrative logic were abandoned, as the final two episodes take place within the main character&#x27;s mind.

The show did not garner high ratings in Japan at its initial time slot, but after being moved to a later, more adult-oriented venue, it gained considerable popularity. Timing constraints at Gainax also forced Anno to replace the planned ending of &quot;Evangelion&quot; with two episodes set in the main characters&#x27; minds. In 1997, Gainax launched a project to re-adapt &quot;Evangelion&quot;″s scrapped ending into a feature-length film. Budgeting issues left the film unfinished, and the completed 27 minutes of animation were included as the second act of &quot;&quot;. Eventually, the project culminated in &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, a three-act film that served as a finale to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. In September 1999, Anno appeared on the NHK TV-documentary &quot;Welcome Back for an Extracurricular Lesson, Senpai!&quot;, answering some &quot;Evangelion&quot;-related questions, including the origin of the name &quot;Evangelion&quot;, and teaching children about animation production.

===Subsequent work===

After &quot;Evangelion&quot;, Anno directed the 1998 anime series &quot;Kareshi Kanojo no Jijō&quot; (&quot;Kare Kano&quot; for short, also known in English as &quot;His and Her Circumstances&quot;), the first Gainax television series to be directly adapted from previously written material. During the production of &quot;Kare Kano&quot;, Anno became frustrated with the restrictions placed on the show by TV Tokyo after the Pokémon seizure incident and has rarely directed television anime since then. The director has also made forays into live-action films, beginning with &quot;Love &amp; Pop&quot; (1998), a cinéma vérité-style film about enjo kosai (&quot;compensated dating&quot;, a form of teenage prostitution) in Japan, of which a major portion was shot on miniature digital cameras with constantly shifting aspect ratios. He won Best New Director Award at 1998 Yokohama Film Festival for the film. Asumi Miwa who played the lead role won Best New Talent award. He and his friend Masayuki also directed the documentary &quot;GAMERA1999&quot; which documented the production of &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot;. His second live-action film, &quot;Shiki-Jitsu&quot; (2000) (&quot;Ritual Day&quot; or &quot;Ceremonial Day&quot;), is the story of a burnt-out former animation director (played by popular indie director Shunji Iwai) who falls in love with a woman disconnected from reality. Though an experimental work like &quot;Love &amp; Pop&quot;, this film was shot using the more traditional 2.35:1 aspect ratio and has a generally more polished presentation, eschewing the cinéma vérité grittiness of Anno&#x27;s first live-action film. This movie earned him Best Artistic Contribution Award at Tokyo International Film Festival and very positive reviews.

Anno&#x27;s third live-action film was &quot;Cutie Honey&quot;, based on Go Nagai&#x27;s 1973 manga and anime series. Released in the summer of 2004, this lighthearted fantasy/superhero film was a stark contrast to his earlier, more realist live-action works. Later in 2004, Anno supervised but did not direct the three-part OVA, &quot;&quot;, which was respectively directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi (part 1), Takamichi Itō (part 2), and Masayuki (part 3). Also released in 2004 was the movie , in which Anno makes several acting cameos: as the student in the front row of the &quot;Home Room!&quot; skit sitting next to Hataru, in &quot;Who&#x27;s the Director?&quot; as an animator who feels he is being overworked, and finally in &quot;Singles Picnic&quot; he is among the men awaiting females who never come.

On August 1, 2006, Hideaki Anno&#x27;s official website was updated with job listings for key animators and production staff at a company he founded, Studio Khara. In September 2006, Anno&#x27;s departure from Gainax was reported in the October edition of the Japanese animation magazine &quot;Newtype&quot;. On September 9, 2006, GAINAX&#x27;s official website confirmed that &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; was in the works. The first three movies would be an alternate retelling of the TV series (including many new scenes, settings, backgrounds, characters), and the fourth movie would be a completely new conclusion to the story. Kazuya Tsurumaki and Masayuki would direct the movies while Yoshiyuki Sadamoto would provide character designs and Ikuto Yamashita would provide mechanical designs. Shinji Higuchi would provide storyboards for the first movie. The first was launched in Summer 2007, and the second and third were planned to be launched in 2008, however, the second installment was released by itself on June 27, 2009. The third movie was to be released simultaneously with the fourth, instead, the third movie was released on November 17, 2012, and the release date for the fourth movie in Japan was announced to be June 27, 2020. On February 17, 2007, Anno published an official statement on the Japanese Yahoo Portal for the films regarding his personal involvement and goals in their production. In October 2007, Hideaki Anno resigned from Gainax. In 2011 Anno co-produced the Koinobori Pictures movie &quot;Kantoku Shikkaku&quot; (&quot;Failed Director&quot;), directed by Katsuyuki Hirano featuring Yumika Hayashi.

In 2012, Anno was the curator of an exhibit entitled &quot;Tokusatsu- Special Effects Museum-Craftsmanship of Showa and Heisei Eras Seen Through Miniatures&quot;, held at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo, featuring actual props and suits from many of Japan&#x27;s tokusatsu films and TV shows. Anno also produced a short live-action film for the exhibit, entitled &quot;A Giant Warrior Descends on Tokyo&quot;, featuring the Giant Warrior-God from Studio Ghibli&#x27;s animated film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. He has gone on to work with Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli on several short films which have been shown at the Ghibli Museum. He also voiced the main character Jiro Horikoshi in Miyazaki&#x27;s 2013 feature film &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;. He also designed the &quot;Space Battleship Yamato 2199&quot; sci-fi anime television series opening sequence. In 2014, Anno and Studio Khara launched &quot;Japan Animator Expo&quot;, a series of original net animations made by various directors. In March 2015, it was announced that Anno would team up with close friend and Gainax cofounder Shinji Higuchi to write and codirect &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot;, the 2016 reboot of Toho&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise.

Anno wrote and directed &quot;&quot; (2021), launched in March 2021, after being rescheduled twice due to COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that Shinji&#x27;s story was completed, but mentioned that he had more ideas set in &quot;Evangelion&quot; world.

==Depictions==
Anno has appeared in manga twice, both created by personal acquaintances. His wife, Moyoko Anno, wrote &quot;Insufficient Direction&quot;, a chronicle of their courtship and marriage and depicting Anno&#x27;s &quot;true face&quot; as &quot;the founder of the otaku cult&quot;. In 2007, a college-age version of him appeared alongside other Gainax founders Hiroyuki Yamaga, Takami Akai, and Toshio Okada in the Kazuhiko Shimamoto manga &quot;Aoi Honō&quot;. Anno attended Osaka University of Arts with Shimamoto. &quot;Aoi Honō&quot; was adapted into a live-action television drama in 2014, where Anno was played by actor Ken Yasuda. The 2014 animated series &quot;Shirobako&quot; has a cameo appearance by a character named &quot;Mitsuaki Kanno&quot;, a caricature of Anno.

== Personal life ==
On March 26, 2002, Anno married his wife, manga artist Moyoco Anno. He is an agnostic and has stated that he has found Japanese spiritualism to be closest to his personal beliefs. Anno is also a vegetarian.

<text>Vice Admiral Thomas J. Walker (August 6, 1916 – May 8, 2003) was an officer of the United States Navy, who served as first commanding officer of the aircraft carrier .

==Early life and education==
Thomas Jackson Walker III was born in Edgartown, Massachusetts (on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard), on August 6, 1916, into a family with long maritime connections—three of his great-grandfathers had been whaling ship captains. After attending schools in Massachusetts and Florida, he attended the Marion Military Institute in Alabama. He then entered the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, with the class of 1939, and while there was stroke of the Academy crew and vice-president of his class for four years.

==World War II==
Following his commission as an ensign in June 1939, he joined the cruiser . In August 1941, he was detached for flight training at the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Designated Naval Aviator in March 1942, he joined the battleship as Senior Aviator. In this position, Walker spotted shore bombardment during the North African invasion at Safi, French Morocco and Casablanca and later participated in anti-submarine flights over convoys. He was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal &quot;for his performance of duty on November 8, 1942, during the bombardment of Safi, French Morocco. Despite heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire he kept his ship supplied with accurate and timely reports without which the effect of the bombardment may not have been so effectively executed...&quot;

Returning to the United States in 1943, he attended the Post Graduate School at Annapolis, where he completed the course in Aviation Ordnance in December 1944. He next reported to the Fire Control Desk in the Bureau of Aeronautics and remained there until July 1945. He was then assigned as Prospective Bomb Commander for the third atomic bomb at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. That bomb was planned to be detonated over Tokyo but was never dropped due to the cessation of hostilities in August 1945.

==Post-war career==
Immediately after World War II, Walker served as Commanding Officer of Fighter Squadrons 17, 5-B and 61, during which time he was embarked with his respective squadrons aboard the newly commissioned carriers and . After service as Commanding Officer of the Naval Air Special Weapons Facility at the Sandia base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. In July 1951, he assumed command of Air Development Squadron 5. A group engaged in developing tactics for the delivery of special weapons from light aircraft at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California. In 1955 he became a student at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in Washington, D.C.

Walker then began his association with the Polaris missile program as head of the Test Branch of the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program. He was temporarily assigned as Assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations, working on a classified project until June 1957. He then spent a year as Commanding Officer of the Fleet All-Weather Training Unit where he was concerned with training of carrier pilots for all weather flying and in the air defense of southern California.

In July 1958 Walker was back in Washington working with the Polaris as head of Ship Operations and Test Branch and Systems Development Analysis Chief. For his work with Polaris Captain Walker received the Navy Commendation Medal with Citation, which reads in part, &quot;Captain Walker carried out his responsibilities with outstanding leadership and resourcefulness. Through his untiring efforts and high level of technical skill, he made a major contribution to the success of the Fleet Ballistic Missile System...&quot;

In April 1960 Walker assumed his first ship command, the ammunition ship . Six months later he was ordered detached from &quot;Nitro&quot; as Prospective Commanding Officer of , which was under construction at the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York. Walker assumed command of &quot;Constellation&quot; on October 27, 1961.

On November 9, 1963, Walker was promoted to Rear Admiral (lower half) and was relieved of command of &quot;Constellation&quot; by Captain Stanley W. &quot;Swede&quot; Vejesta.

From 1969 to 1971 Walker commanded the Naval Air Systems Command. Walker retired from the Navy as a Vice Admiral, after serving as Commander of Naval Air of the Pacific Fleet (COMNAVAIRPAC).

Admiral Walker died on May 8, 2003 at the age of 86 from pneumonia.

<text>The American Humanist Association (AHA) is a non-profit organization in the United States that advances secular humanism.

The American Humanist Association was founded in 1941 and currently provides legal assistance to defend the constitutional rights of secular and religious minorities, lobbies Congress on church-state separation and other issues, and maintains a grassroots network of 250 local affiliates and chapters that engage in social activism and community-building events. The AHA has several publications, including &quot;The Humanist&quot;, &quot;Free Mind&quot;, peer-reviewed semi-annual scholastic journal &quot;Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism&quot;, and TheHumanist.com. The organization states that it has over 34,000 members.

==History==
In 1927, an organization which was named the &quot;Humanist Fellowship&quot; was founded during a gathering in Chicago. In 1928, the Fellowship started publishing the &quot;New Humanist&quot; magazine with H.G. Creel as its first editor. The &quot;New Humanist&quot; was published from 1928 to 1936. The first &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; was issued by a conference held at the University of Chicago in 1933. Signatories included John Dewey, but the majority were ministers (chiefly Unitarian) and theologians. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses reason, ethics, and social and economic justice.

By 1935, the Humanist Fellowship had become the &quot;Humanist Press Association&quot;, the first national association of humanism in the United States.

In July 1939, a group of Quakers, inspired by the 1933 &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot;, incorporated the Humanist Society of Friends as a religious, educational, charitable nonprofit organization authorized to issue charters and train &amp; ordain its own ministry. Upon ordination these ministers were then accorded the same rights and privileges granted by law to priests, ministers, and rabbis of traditional theistic religions.

In 1941, Curtis Reese led the reorganization and incorporation of the &quot;Humanist Press Association&quot; as the American Humanist Association. Along with its reorganization, the AHA began printing &quot;The Humanist&quot; magazine. The AHA was originally headquartered in Yellow Springs, Ohio, then San Francisco, California, and, in 1978, Amherst, New York. Subsequently, the AHA moved to Washington, D.C.

In 1952, the AHA became a founding member of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The AHA was the first national membership organization to support abortion rights. Around the same time, the AHA partnered with the American Ethical Union (AEU) to help establish the rights of non-theistic conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. In the late 1960s, the AHA also secured a religious tax exemption in support of its celebrant program, allowing Humanist celebrants to legally officiate at weddings, perform chaplaincy functions, and in other ways enjoy the same rights as traditional clergy.

In 1991, the AHA took control of the Humanist Society, a religious Humanist organization that now runs the celebrant program. After this transfer, the AHA commenced the process of jettisoning its religious tax exemption and resumed its exclusively educational status. Today the AHA is recognized by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit, tax exempt, 501(c)(3), publicly supported educational organization.

Membership numbers are disputed, but Djupe and Olson place it as &quot;definitely fewer than 50,000.&quot; The AHA has over 575,000 followers on Facebook and over 42,000 followers on Twitter.

==Adjuncts and affiliates==
The AHA is the supervising organization for various Humanist affiliates and adjunct organizations.

=== Black Humanist Alliance ===
The Black Humanist Alliance of the American Humanist Association was founded in 2016 as a pillar of its new &quot;Initiatives for Social Justice&quot;. Like the Feminist Humanist Alliance and the LGBT Humanist Alliance, the Black Humanist Alliance uses an intersectional approach to addressing issues facing the Black community. As its mission states, the BHA &quot;concern ourselves with confronting expressions of religious hegemony in public policy,&quot; but is &quot;also devoted to confronting social, economic, and political deprivations that disproportionately impact Black America due to centuries of culturally ingrained prejudices.&quot;

===Feminist Humanist Alliance===
The Feminist Humanist Alliance (formerly the Feminist Caucus) of the American Humanist Association was established in 1977 as a coalition of women and men within the AHA to work toward the advancement of women&#x27;s rights and equality between the sexes in all aspects of society. Originally called the Women&#x27;s Caucus, the new name was adopted in 1985 as more representative of all the members of the caucus and of the caucus&#x27; goals. Over the years, members of the Caucus have advocated for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and participated in various public demonstrations, including marches for women&#x27;s and civil rights. In 1982, the Caucus established its annual Humanist Heroine Award, with the initial award being presented to Sonia Johnson. Others receiving the awards have included Tish Sommers, Christine Craft, and Fran Hosken. In 2012 the Caucus declared it would be organizing around two principal efforts: &quot;Refocusing on passing the ERA&quot; and &quot;Promoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&quot;

In 2016, the Feminist Caucus reorganized as the Feminist Humanist Alliance as a component of their larger &quot;Initiatives for Social Justice&quot;. As stated on its website, the &quot;refinement in vision&quot; emphasized &quot;FHA&#x27;s more active partnership with outreach programs and social justice campaigns with distinctly inclusive feminist objectives.&quot; Its current goal is to provide a &quot;movement powered by and for women, transpeople, and genderqueer people to fight for social justice. We are united to create inclusive and diverse spaces for activists and allies on the local and national level.&quot;

=== LGBTQ Humanist Alliance ===
The LGBTQ Humanist Alliance (formerly LGBT Humanist Council) of the American Humanist Association is committed to advancing equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and their families. The alliance &quot;seeks to cultivate safe and affirming communities, promote humanist values, and achieve full equality and social liberation of LGBTQ persons.&quot;

Paralleling the Black Humanist Alliance and the Feminist Humanist Alliance, the Council reformed in 2016 as the LGBTQ Humanist Alliance as a larger part of the AHA&#x27;s &quot;Initiatives for Social Justice&quot;.

===Disaster Recovery===
In 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and Foundation Beyond Belief (FBB) merged their respective charitable programs Humanist Charities (established in 2005) and Humanist Crisis Response (established in 2011). AHA&#x27;s Executive Director Roy Speckhardt commented that, &quot;This merger is a positive move that will grow the relief efforts of the humanist community. The end result will be more money directed to charitable activities, dispelling the false claim that nonbelievers don&#x27;t give to charity.&quot;

Now Foundation Beyond Belief&#x27;s Disaster Recovery program, this effort serves as a focal point for the humanist response to major natural disasters and complex humanitarian crises all over the world. The program coordinates financial support as well as trained humanist volunteers to help impacted communities. The Disaster Recovery program is sustained through the ongoing partnership between FBB and AHA, and ensures that our community&#x27;s efforts are centralized and efficient.

Between 2014 and 2018, Humanist Disaster Recovery has raised over $250,000 for victims of the Syrian Refugee Crisis, Refugee Children of the U.S. Border, Tropical Cyclone Sam, and the Nepal and Ecuadoran Earthquakes, Hurricane Matthew in Haiti, and Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In addition to grants for recovery efforts, volunteers have also helped to rebuild homes and schools in the following locations: Columbia, South Carolina after the effects of Hurricane Joaquin, in Denham Springs, Louisiana; and in Houston, Texas after the flooding from Hurricane Harvey.

===Appignani Humanist Legal Center===

The association launched the Appignani Humanist Legal Center (AHLC) in 2006 to ensure that humanists&#x27; constitutional rights are represented in court. Through amicus activity, litigation, and legal advocacy, a team of cooperating lawyers, including Jim McCollum, Wendy Kaminer, and Michael Newdow, provide legal assistance by challenging perceived violations of the Establishment Clause.

* The AHLC&#x27;s first independent litigation was filed on November 29, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Attorney James Hurley, the AHLC lawyer serving as lead counsel, filed suit against the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections on behalf of Plaintiff Jerry Rabinowitz, whose polling place was a church in Delray Beach, Florida. The church featured numerous religious symbols, including signs exhorting people to &quot;Make a Difference with God&quot; and anti-abortion posters, which the AHLC claimed demonstrated a violation of the Establishment Clause. In the voting area itself, &quot;Rabinowitz observed many religious symbols in plain view, both surrounding the election judges and in direct line above the voting machines. He took photographs that will be entered in evidence.&quot; U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks ruled that Jerry Rabinowitz did not have standing to challenge the placement of polling sites in churches, and dismissed the case.
*In February 2014, AHA brought suit to force the removal of the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a war memorial honoring 49 residents of Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, who died in World War I. AHA represented the plaintiffs, Mr. Lowe, who drives by the memorial &quot;about once a month&quot; and Fred Edwords, former AHA Executive director. AHA argued that the presence of a Christian religious symbol on public property violates the First Amendment clause prohibiting government from establishing a religion. Town officials feel the monument to have historic and patriotic significant to local residents.
*In March 2014, a Southern California woman reluctantly removed a roadside memorial from near a freeway ramp where her 19-year-old son was killed after the AHA contacted the city council calling the cross on city-owned property a &quot;serious constitutional violation&quot;.
*AHLC represented an atheist family who claimed that the equal rights amendment of the Massachusetts constitution prohibits mandatory daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance because the anthem contains the phrase &quot;under God&quot;. In November 2012 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court permitted a direct appeal with oral arguments set for early 20 but . in May 2014, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in a unanimous decision that the daily recitation of the phrase &quot;under god&quot; in the US Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the plaintiffs&#x27; equal protection rights under the Massachusetts Constitution.
*In February 2015 New Jersey Superior Court Judge David F. Bauman dismissed a lawsuit challenging the Pledge of Allegiance, ruling that &quot;...the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the rights of those who don&#x27;t believe in God and does not have to be removed from the patriotic message.&quot; In a twenty-one-page decision, Bauman wrote, &quot;Under (the association members&#x27;) reasoning, the very constitution under which (the members) seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be deem unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which (association members) do not and cannot advance here.&quot;

==Advertising campaigns==
The American Humanist Association has received media attention for its various advertising campaigns; in 2010, the AHA&#x27;s campaign was said to be the more expensive than similar ad campaigns from the American Atheists and Freedom From Religion Foundation.

In 2008 it ran ads on buses in Washington, D.C., that proclaimed &quot;Why believe in a god? Just be good for goodness&#x27; sake&quot;, and since 2009 the organization has paid for billboard advertisements nationwide. One such billboard, which stated &quot;No God...No Problem&quot; was repeatedly vandalized.

In 2010 it launched another ad campaign promoting Humanism, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; said was the &quot;first (atheist campaign) to include spots on television and cable&quot; and was described by CNN as the &quot;largest, most extensive advertising campaign ever by a godless organization&quot;. The campaign featured violent or sexist quotes from holy books, contrasted with quotes from humanist thinkers, including physicist Albert Einstein, and was largely underwritten by Todd Stiefel, a retired pharmaceutical company executive.

In late 2011 it launched a holiday billboard campaign, placing advertisements in 7 different cities: Kearny, New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Cranston, Rhode Island; Bastrop, Louisiana; Oregon City, Oregon; College Station, Texas and Rochester Hills, Michigan&quot;, cities where AHA stated &quot;atheists have experienced discrimination due to their lack of belief in a traditional god&quot;. The organization spent more than $200,000 on their campaign which included a billboard reading &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is no god.&quot;

In November 2012, the AHA launched a national ad campaign to promote a new website, KidsWithoutGod.com, with ads using the slogans &quot;I&#x27;m getting a bit old for imaginary friends&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Not The Only One&quot;. The campaign included bus advertising in Washington, DC, a billboard in Moscow, Idaho, and online ads on the family of websites run by Cheezburger and Pandora Radio, as well as Facebook, Reddit, Google, and YouTube. Ads were turned down because of their content by Disney, Time for Kids and National Geographic Kids.

==National Day of Reason==
The National Day of Reason was created by the American Humanist Association and the Washington Area Secular Humanists in 2003. In addition to serving as a holiday for secularists, the National Day of Reason was created in response to the unconstitutionality of the National Day of Prayer. According to the organizers of the event, the National Day of Prayer &quot;violates the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because it asks federal, state, and local government entities to set aside tax dollar supported time and space to engage in religious ceremonies&quot;. Several organizations associated with the National Day of Reason have organized food drives and blood donations, while other groups have called for an end to prayer invocations at city meetings. Other organizations, such as the Oklahoma Atheists and the Minnesota Atheists, have organized local secular celebrations as alternatives to the National Day of Prayer. Additionally, many individuals affiliated with these atheistic groups choose to protest the official National Day of Prayer.

== Reason Rally ==
In 2012, the American Humanist Association co-sponsored the Reason Rally, a national gathering of &quot;humanists, atheists, freethinkers and nonbelievers from across the United States and abroad&quot; in Washington, D.C. The rally, held on the National Mall, had speakers such as Richard Dawkins, James Randi, Adam Savage, and student activist Jessica Ahlqvist. According to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, the event&#x27;s attendance was between 8,000 and 10,000 while the &quot;Atlantic&quot; reported nearly 20,000. The AHA also co-sponsored the 2016 Reason Rally at the Lincoln Memorial.

== Famous awardees ==
The American Humanist Association has named a &quot;Humanist of the Year&quot; annually since 1953. It has also granted other honors to numerous leading figures, including Salman Rushdie (Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism 2007), Oliver Stone (Humanist Arts Award, 1996), Katharine Hepburn (Humanist Arts Award 1985), John Dewey (Humanist Pioneer Award, 1954), Jack Kevorkian (Humanist Hero Award, 1996) and Vashti McCollum (Distinguished Service Award, 1991).

==Controversy==
In 2021, Richard Dawkins said on Twitter that &quot;In 2015, Rachel Dolezal, a white chapter president of NAACP, was vilified for identifying as Black. Some men choose to identify as women, and some women choose to identify as men. You will be vilified if you deny that they literally are what they identify as. Discuss.&quot; After receiving criticism for this tweet, Dawkins responded by saying that &quot;I do not intend to disparage trans people. I see that my academic &#x27;Discuss&#x27; question has been misconstrued as such and I deplore this. It was also not my intent to ally in any way with Republican bigots in US now exploiting this issue.&quot;

In response to these comments, the American Humanist Association retracted Dawkins&#x27; 1996 Humanist of the Year Award. Robby Soave of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine criticized the retraction, saying that &quot;The drive to punish dissenters from various orthodoxies is itself illiberal.&quot;

<doc id="311272" wikidata="Q593355" url="?curid=311272" title="Treaty of Alcáçovas">
<text>The Treaty of Alcáçovas (also known as Treaty or Peace of Alcáçovas-Toledo) was signed on 4 September 1479 between the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon on one side and Afonso V and his son, Prince John of Portugal, on the other side.
It put an end to the War of the Castilian Succession, which ended with a victory of the Castilians on land and a Portuguese victory on the sea.
 The four peace treaties signed at Alcáçovas reflected that outcome: Isabella was recognized as Queen of Castile while Portugal reached hegemony in the Atlantic Ocean.

The treaty intended to regulate:
*The renunciation of Afonso V and Castilian Monarchs to the Castilian throne and Portuguese throne, respectively
*The division of the Atlantic Ocean and overseas territories into two zones of influence
*The destiny of Juana de Trastámara
*The contract of marriage between Isabella, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, with Afonso, heir of Prince John. This was known as Tercerias de Moura, and included the payment to Portugal of a war compensation by the Catholic Monarchs in the form of marriage dowry.
*The pardon of the Castilian supporters of Juana

==War of the Castilian Succession==

After the death of Henry IV in 1474, the Castilian crown was disputed between the half-sister of the king, Isabella I of Castile, married to Prince Ferdinand II of Aragon, and the king&#x27;s daughter, Juana de Trastámara, popularly known as la Beltraneja – because her father was alleged to be Beltrán de la Cueva.
In the subsequent civil war, Afonso V of Portugal married Juana and invaded Castile (May 1475), defending her rights.

Parallel to the dynastic struggle, there was a fierce naval war between the fleets of Portugal and Castile to access and control overseas territories − especially Guinea – whose gold and slaves were the heart of the Portuguese power.
The main events of this war were the indecisive battle of Toro (1 March 1476), transformed in a strategic victory by the Catholic Monarchs and the battle of Guinea (1478), which granted Portugal the hegemony in the Atlantic Ocean and disputed territories.

Historian Stephen R. Bown wrote:
When Ferdinand and Isabella secured their rule after the Battle of Toro on 1 March 1476- effectively eliminating the threat of Portuguese invasion but not officially ending the war- they renewed the twenty-year-old Castilian claim to their &quot;ancient and exclusive&quot; rights to the Canary Islands and the Guinea coast ... They encouraged Spanish merchant ships to take advantage of the political disruption and considered making direct attacks on Portuguese vessels returning from Guinea, with the objective of seizing the monopoly... In 1478 a Spanish fleet of thirty-five caravels was intercepted by an armed Portuguese squadron. Most of the fleet was captured and taken to Lisbon. [I]n 1479 ... the two nations concluded terms for peace with the treaty of Alcáçovas, ending the struggle for the succession as well as their battle at sea.

==Treaty outcomes==

*Juana de Trastamara and Afonso V waived their rights to the Castilian throne in favour of the Catholic Monarchs, who gave up their claims over the throne of Portugal.
*There was a sharing of the Atlantic territories between both countries and a delimitation of the respective spheres of influence.
* With the exception of the Canary Islands, all territories and shores disputed between Portugal and Castile stayed under Portuguese control; Guinea with its gold mines, Madeira (discovered in 1419), the Azores (discovered about 1427) and Cape Verde (discovered about 1456). Portugal also won the exclusive right of conquering the Kingdom of Fez.
* Castile&#x27;s rights over the Canary Islands were recognised while Portugal won the exclusive right of navigating, conquering and trading in all the Atlantic Ocean south of the Canary Islands. Thus, Portugal attained hegemony in the Atlantic not only for its known territories but also for those discovered in the future. Castile was restricted to the Canaries.
*Portugal gained a war compensation of 106,676 dobles of gold in the form of Isabella&#x27;s dowry.
*Both infants (Isabella and Afonso) stayed in Portugal under the regiment of &quot;Tercerias&quot;, at the village of Moura, waiting for the appropriate age. The Catholic Monarchs were responsible for all costs of maintaining the &quot;Tercerias&quot;.
*Juana had to choose between staying in Portugal and entering a religious order or marrying Prince Juan, son of the Catholic Monarchs: she chose the former.
*The Castilian supporters of Juana and Afonso were pardoned.

==Possessions==
This treaty, ratified later by the papal bull &quot;Aeterni regis&quot; in 1481, essentially gave the Portuguese free rein to continue their exploration along the African coast while guaranteeing Castilian sovereignty in the Canaries. It also prohibited Castilians from sailing to the Portuguese possessions without Portuguese licence. The Treaty of Alcáçovas, establishing Castilian and Portuguese spheres of control in the Atlantic, settled a period of open hostility, but it also laid the basis for future claims and conflict.

Portugal&#x27;s rival Castile had been somewhat slower than its neighbour to begin exploring the Atlantic, and it was not until late in the fifteenth century that Castilian sailors began to compete with their western neighbours. The first contest was for control of the Canary Islands, which Castile won. It was not until the union of Aragon and Castile and the completion of the Reconquista that the larger country became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492, the joint rulers of the country decided to fund Christopher Columbus&#x27; expedition that they hoped would bypass Portugal&#x27;s lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, and instead, reach Asia by travelling west over the Atlantic.

==Precedent in international law==
The Treaty of Alcáçovas was the first document to define &quot;the field reserved for the future discoveries&quot; of Spain and Portugal, specifically delineating &quot;the respective rights of the two crowns over the territories of the African Continent and the Atlantic islands.&quot; In this way, it can be considered a landmark in the history of colonialism. It is one of the first international documents formally outlining the principle that European powers are empowered to divide the rest of the world into &quot;spheres of influence&quot; and colonise the territories located within such spheres, and that any indigenous peoples living there need not be asked for consent. This remained a generally accepted principle in the ideology and practice of European powers up to the 20th century decolonization. The Treaty of Alcáçovas could be regarded as the ancestor of many later international treaties and instruments based on the same basic principle. These include the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which further codified the positions of Spain and Portugal in world exploration, and the resolutions of the 1884 Conference of Berlin, four centuries later, which in much the same way divided Africa into colonial spheres of influence.

<text>A gunship is a military aircraft armed with heavy aircraft guns, primarily intended for attacking ground targets either as airstrike or as close air support.

In modern usage the term &quot;gunship&quot; refers to fixed-wing aircraft having laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. These gunships are configured to circle the target instead of performing strafing runs. Such aircraft have their armament on one side harmonized to fire at the apex of an imaginary cone formed by the aircraft and the ground when performing a pylon turn (banking turn). The term &quot;gunship&quot; originated in the mid-19th century as a synonym for gunboat and also referred to the heavily armed ironclad steamships used during the American Civil War.

The term helicopter gunship is commonly used to describe armed helicopters.

==World War II aviation==

===Bomber escort===

During 1942 and 1943, the lack of a usable escort fighter for the United States Army Air Forces in the European Theatre of Operations led to experiments in dramatically increasing the armament of a standard Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress, and later a single Consolidated B-24D Liberator, to each have 14 to 16 Browning AN/M2 .50 cal machine guns as the Boeing YB-40 Flying Fortress and Consolidated XB-41 Liberator respectively. These were to accompany regular heavy bomber formations over occupied Europe on strategic bombing raids for long-range escort duties as &quot;flying destroyer gunships&quot;. The YB-40 was sometimes described as a gunship, and a small 25-aircraft batch of the B-17-derived gunships were built, with a dozen of these deployed to Europe; the XB-41 had problems with stability and did not progress.

===Attack aircraft===
During World War II, the urgent need for hard-hitting attack aircraft led to the development of the heavily armed gunship versions of the North American B-25 Mitchell. For use against shipping in the Pacific 405 B-25Gs were armed with a 75 mm (2.95 in) M4 cannon and a thousand B-25Hs followed. The H models, delivered from August 1943, moved the dorsal turret forward to just behind the cockpit and were armed with the lighter 75 mm T13E1 cannon. The B-25J variant removed the 75 mm gun but carried a total of eighteen 0.50 cal (12.7 mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns, more than any other contemporary American aircraft: eight in the nose, four in under-cockpit flank-mount gun pod packages, two in the dorsal turret, one each in the pair of waist positions, and a pair in the tail, giving a maximum of fourteen guns firing forward in strafing runs. Later the B-25J was armed with eight 5 in (130 mm) high velocity aircraft rockets (HVARs).

The British also made large numbers of twin-engined fighter bombers. The de Havilland Mosquito FB.VI had a fixed armament of four Hispano Mk.II cannon and four Browning machine guns, together with up to of bombs in the bomb bay and on racks housed in streamlined fairings under each wing, or up to eight &quot;60lb&quot; RP-3 rockets. De Havilland also produced seventeen Mosquito FB Mk XVIIIs armed with a QF 6-pdr anti-tank gun with autoloader, which were used against German ships and U-boats.

The Germans also made a sizable number of heavy fighter types (&quot;Zerstörer&quot;—&quot;destroyer&quot;) armed with heavy guns (&quot;Bordkanone&quot;). Dedicated &quot;tankbuster&quot; aircraft such as the Ju 87Gs (&quot;Kanonenvogel&quot;) were armed with two BK 37 mm autocannon in underwing gun pods. The Ju 88P gunships were armed with guns, and were used as tankbusters and as bomber destroyers. The Hs 129 could carry a MK 101 cannon or MK 103 cannon in a conformally mounted gun pod (B-2/R-2). The Me 410 &quot;Hornisse&quot; were armed with the same BK 50 mm autocannon as the Ju 88P-4, but were only used as bomber destroyers. None of the German twin-engine heavy fighters types were produced or converted in large numbers.

==Post–World War II aviation==

===Fixed-wing aircraft===

In the more modern, post-World War II fixed-wing aircraft category, a gunship is an aircraft having laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. These gunships were configured to circle the target instead of performing strafing runs. Such aircraft have their armament on one side harmonized to fire at the apex of an imaginary cone formed by the aircraft and the ground when performing a pylon turn (banking turn).

The Douglas AC-47 Spooky was the first notable modern gunship. In 1964, during the Vietnam War, the popular Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport was successfully modified into a gunship by the United States Air Force with three side-firing Miniguns for circling attacks. At the time the aircraft was known as a &quot;Dragonship&quot;, &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot; or &quot;Spooky&quot; (officially designated FC-47, later corrected to AC-47). Its three miniguns could selectively fire either 50 or 100 rounds per second. Cruising in an overhead left-hand orbit at air speed at an altitude of , the gunship could put a bullet or glowing red tracer (every fifth round) into every square yard of a football field–sized target in potentially less than 10 seconds. And, as long as its 45-flare and 24,000-round basic load of ammunition held out, it could do this intermittently while loitering over the target for hours.

The lesser known Fairchild AC-119G Shadow and AC-119K Stingers were twin-engine piston-powered gunships developed by the United States during the Vietnam War. Armed with four 7.62 mm GAU-2/A Miniguns (and two 20 mm (0.787 in) M61 Vulcan six-barrel rotary cannons in the AC-119K version), they replaced the Douglas AC-47 Spooky and operated alongside the early versions of the AC-130 Spectre gunship.

It was the later and larger Lockheed AC-130 &quot;Gunship II&quot; that became the modern, post–World War II origin of the term gunship in military aviation. These heavily armed aircraft used a variety of weapon systems, including GAU-2/A Miniguns, M61 Vulcan six-barrel rotary cannons, GAU-12/U Equalizer five-barreled rotary cannons, Mk44 Bushmaster II chain guns, 40 mm (1.58 in) L/60 Bofors autocannons, and M102 howitzers. The Douglas AC-47 Spooky, the Fairchild AC-119, and the AC-130 Spectre/Spooky, were vulnerable, and meant to operate only after achieving air superiority.

Smaller gunship designs such as the Fairchild AU-23 Peacemaker and the Helio AU-24 Stallion were also designed by the United States during the Vietnam War. These aircraft were meant to be cheap and easy to fly and maintain, and were to be given to friendly governments in Southeast Asia to assist with counter-insurgency operations, eventually seeing service with the Khmer National Air Force, Royal Thai Air Force, and Republic of Vietnam Air Force as well as limited use by the United States Air Force.

Renewed interest in the concept of gunships has resulted in the development of a gunship variant of the Alenia C-27J Spartan. Although the United States Air Force decided not to procure the AC-27J, other nations including Italy have chosen the aircraft for introduction. Additionally, in 2013 the US Air Force Special Operations Command reportedly tested a gunship version of the C-145A Skytruck armed with a GAU-18 twin-mount machine gun system.

Later Air Forces in the middle east have begun to experiment with smaller gunships than the AC-130 with the Jordan Air Force converting 2 AC-235 and a single AC-295 into Gunships. These are armed with ATK’s side-mounted M230 chain guns and various munitions ( rockets, hellfire missiles and bombs) mounted on to wing pylons.
Other smaller modern gunships include the AC-27J Stinger II and the MC-27J produced by Alenia Aeronautica in Italy.

===Helicopter gunships===

Early helicopter gunships also operated in the side-firing configuration, with an early example being the Aérospatiale Alouette III. During the Overseas wars in Africa in the 1960s, the Portuguese Air Force experimented with the installation of M2 Browning machine guns in a side-firing twin-mounting configuration in some of its Alouette III helicopters. Later, the machine guns were replaced by a MG 151 20 mm cannon in a single mounting. These helicopters were known in Portuguese service as &quot;&quot;helicanhões&quot; (heli-cannons) and were used in the escort of unarmed transport helicopters in air assault operations and in the fire support to the troops in the ground. The South African and Rhodesian air forces later used armed Alouette III in similar configurations as the Portuguese, respectively in the South African Border and Rhodesian Bush wars.

During the Algerian War, the French operated Sikorsky H-34 &quot;Pirate&quot; armed with a German 20mm MG151 cannon and two .50 inch machine guns. During the early days of the Vietnam War, USMC H-34s were among the first helicopter gunships in theater, fitted with the Temporary Kit-1 (TK-1), comprising two M60C machine guns and two 19-shot 2.75 inch rocket pods. The operations were met with mixed enthusiasm, and the armed H-34s, known as &quot;Stingers&quot;, were quickly phased out. The TK-1 kit would form the basis of the TK-2 kit used later on the UH-1E helicopters of the USMC.

The U.S. Army also experimented with H-34 gunships armed with M2 .50 caliber machine-guns and 2.75-inch rockets. In September 1971, a CH-34 was armed with two M2 .50 caliber machine guns, four M1919 .30 caliber machine guns, forty 2.75-inch rockets, two 5-inch high velocity aerial rockets (HVAR), plus two additional .30 caliber machine guns in the left side aft windows and one .50 caliber machine gun in the right side cargo door. The result was the world&#x27;s most heavily armed helicopter at the time.

Also, during the Vietnam War, the ubiquitous Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters were modified into gunships by mounting the U.S. Helicopter Armament Subsystems—these were forward-firing weapons, such as machine guns, rockets, and autocannons, that began to appear in 1962–1963. Helicopters can use a variety of combat maneuvers to approach a target. In their case, the term &quot;gunship&quot; is synonymous with &quot;heavily armed helicopter&quot;. Specifically, dedicated attack helicopters such as the Bell AH-1 Cobra also fit this meaning. In any case, the gunship armaments include machine guns, rockets, and missiles.

The Soviet Mil Mi-24 (NATO code name: Hind) is a large, heavily armed and armored helicopter gunship and troop transport. It was introduced in the 1970s and operated by the pre-1991 Soviet Air Force and its successors post-1991, and more than 30 other nations. It was heavily armed with a reinforced fuselage, designed to withstand .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine gun fire. Its armored cockpits and titanium rotor head are able to withstand 20 mm cannon hits.

<text>Paul Anthony &quot;Paulie&quot; Ayala (born April 22, 1970) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1992 to 2004. He was a multiple-division World champion who held the WBA bantamweight title and The Ring Magazine super bantamweight title. In 1999 he was voted &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine for his first bout against Johnny Tapia, which also won &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; honors.

==Professional career==
Ayala began his professional fighting career with a six-round decision win over Jaime Olvera on November 27, 1992. He had seven fights in 1993, including one against future NABO champion and world title challenger Jesse Magana. Ayala won all seven of those bouts, four by knockout. Magana was knocked out in the fourth round, after which Ayala went on to score wins over prospects Evgeny Novoselov and George Acevedo.

In 1994, he won all four of his bouts, including one over veteran Lee Cargle. Cargle was knocked out by Ayala in round three. 1995 was a productive year for Ayala, who won all five of his fights, including his first regional championship bout. By defeating Mike Espinoza by knockout in three rounds at the Fort Worth Convention Center, Ayala claimed the NABF bantamweight title. He defended it twice before the end of the year, beating Mario Diaz and Sergio Millan, both by decision in 12 rounds.

Ayala only had two fights in 1996, both of them successful defenses of his NABF title. In the first, he knocked out Roland Gomez in seven rounds but was forced to take a seven-month layoff due to a broken Hand. Returning to the ring in September, Ayala defeated Ivan Alvarez by a decision in twelve to retain the NABF bantamweight title.

He began 1997 by defeating Cuauhtemoc Gomez by decision in twelve, once again retaining his belt as the headliner at the Tropicana Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Ayala won three more bouts that year, defeating heavy-handed puncher Nestor Lopez in a co-main event feature on an HBO pay-per-view card, headlining at The Orleans in Paradise, Nevada with a fifth-round knockout over Roberto Lopez to retain the NABF belt. This was followed by another HBO PPV appearance, in which Ayala won a unanimous decision against Ricardo Medina.

At the beginning of 1998, Ayala was very close to a world championship bout. Fighting two more bouts, he received his first chance at a world title by becoming the mandatory contender for the WBC belt. Ayala then traveled to Japan to challenge WBC bantamweight champion Joichiro Tatsuyoshi on August 23. Ayala lost the fight by a sixth-round technical decision when the fight was stopped due to a cut. Tatsuyoshi came out fast in the opening rounds, but Ayala rallied back to win the fifth and sixth rounds unanimously. During the fight, an accidental clash of heads caused a cut and Ayala was docked 2 points. The fight was stopped in round seven due to the severity of the cut, sending the decision to the scorecards and thereby handing victory to Tatsuyoshi.

===WBA bantamweight title===
After a win against Ivan Salazar, Ayala began 1999 by beating David Vazquez by a decision ten. Unable to secure a rematch with Tatsuyoshi, Ayala nonetheless got his second chance at becoming a world champion, this time against WBA bantamweight champion Johnny Tapia. The fight took place in Las Vegas on June 26. Ayala handed Tapia his first career loss and became world champion by winning a twelve-round unanimous decision, in what turned out to be both Ayala&#x27;s Showtime debut and &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Fight of the Year for 1999.

Ayala retained his title against WBA #1 contender Sithai Condo before the end of that year, earning &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine Fighter of the Year honours. In his second title defense, he defeated Johnny Bredahl via a twelve-round decision. On October 7, 2000, Ayala and Tapia met in a rematch for the vacant IBA featherweight title, at a catchweight of 124 lbs. As with the first fight, this took place on Showtime. Due to Tapia being unable to make the bantamweight limit, Ayala&#x27;s WBA bantamweight title was not at stake. Ayala defeated Tapia once again by a twelve-round unanimous decision, a result which was seen as controversial.

On March 30, 2001, Ayala recovered from a fourth-round knockdown to retain his WBA bantamweight title with a twelve-round decision against Hugo Dianzo in an ESPN telecast bout. Ayala then vacated his title to move up in weight.

===Super bantamweight===
On August 4, 2001, Ayala challenged world champion Clarence Adams, who had vacated his WBA super bantamweight title to face Ayala for the vacant IBO title. Ayala defeated Adams via split decision. In a rematch of their closely contested bout, Ayala successfully defended his IBO title by defeating Adams in a wide unanimous decision. Both bouts were featured on HBO telecasts.

===Featherweight===
Continuing his rise in weight, on November 16, 2002 Ayala met world champion Erik Morales for the vacant WBC featherweight title, this time winding up on the losing end of a twelve-round unanimous decision.

Ayala returned to the ring on November 15, 2003, dropping back down to super bantamweight and defeating Edel Ruiz in a ten-round unanimous decision in Fort Worth, Texas. On June 19, 2004 in Los Angeles, Ayala once again ventured into the featherweight division. In a losing effort against fellow former world champion Marco Antonio Barrera, Ayala was knocked out in ten rounds. In September of that year, Ayala surprised many of his boxing fans by announcing his retirement from the sport.

===Punching Out Parkinson&#x27;s===
Following retirement, Ayala has contributed to helping those who suffer from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In Fort Worth, Texas at his University of Hard Knocks gym, Ayala started a program to help Parkinson&#x27;s patients. Using his expertise, he teaches non-contact boxing techniques to regain coordination, strength and balance to improve the quality of life for his students and create an environment of camaraderie.

<doc id="311287" wikidata="Q3233985" url="?curid=311287" title="Charge card">
<text>A charge card is a type of credit card that enables the cardholder to make purchases which are paid for by the card issuer, to whom the cardholder becomes indebted. The cardholder is obliged to repay the debt to the card issuer in full by the due date, usually on a monthly basis, or be subject to late fees and restrictions on further card use. Charge cards are distinct from traditional credit cards, which are revolving credit instruments that do not need to be paid in full every month and a balance may be carried over, on which interest is paid. Charge cards are typically issued without spending limits, whereas credit cards usually have a specified credit limit that the cardholder may not exceed. Most charge cards are held by businesses, corporations or executives thereof, and are issued to customers with a good or excellent credit score.

==History==
In 1914, Western Union opened the first charge account for its customers and provided them with a paper identification. There were many larger department stores which opened store charge accounts for their customers with paper identification, enabling the customer to make purchases on credit provided by the store. However, these accounts could be used only within the store which issued them.

In 1950, Diners Club began opening charge accounts with paper identification cards, directed at the travel and entertainment markets. The novel feature of these cards was that the charge card could be used in a large number of stores. These stores had to enter an agreement with Diners Club, and pay a fee to the company. For the fee, Diners Club carried the cost of setting up accounts, authorizing each transaction, processing transactions and collections, bore the financing costs and assumed the risk of cardholders defaulting. The new system was especially appealing to smaller stores in competition with the larger stores but who could not justify setting up their own charge account facilities. Eventually the larger stores began accepting these cards, testifying that the fees charged by the card operator were lower than the store&#x27;s cost in running their own store accounts. In 1957, American Express also entered the field, and in 1959 was the first company to issue embossed plastic charge cards to ISO/IEC 7810 standards.

In Europe, the MasterCard-affiliated Maestro brand (which is a debit card rather than a charge card) replaced the European Eurocheque brand for payment cards in 2002. Many Eurocheque cards, particularly in such countries as Austria and Germany, were charge cards branded with the Eurocheque logo. In addition, the European Eurocard, issued as the competitor for American Express was, and in some countries (such as the Nordic countries) still is, a charge card. Therefore, the majority of MasterCards in these countries still are charge cards. Visa charge cards are also available in Europe.

==Operation==
The user of the charge card has to pay their account balance at the end of each month and the charge card company, unlike a credit card, does not charge interest. A charge card company&#x27;s main source of revenue is the merchant fee, which is a percentage of the transaction value which typically ranges between 1 and 4%, plus an interchange or minimum fee.

Many charge cards have the option for users to pay for some purchases over time. American Express charge card customers, for instance, can enroll in the Extended Payment Option (internally referred to as ExPO) to be able to pay for purchases over $200 over time, or in Sign &amp; Travel to be able to pay for eligible travel-related expenses over time.

Most charge cards also have a feature called No Preset Spending Limit (NPSL). While consumers often take NPSL to mean that their cards are without limits, NPSL really means that a card&#x27;s limit changes, often from month-to-month, based on factors such as consumer charging and payment history as well overall economic trends. According to a WalletHub.com NPSL study, the way NPSL charge cards are reported to the major credit bureaus varies by issuer and can lead to artificial increases in credit utilization, thereby lowering one&#x27;s FICO Score.

Governments and large businesses often use charge cards to pay for and keep track of expenses related to official business; these are often referred to as purchasing cards. Many retailers and banks issue charge cards to customers. Some American Express and Diners Club cards are charge cards, rather than credit or debit cards such as VISA and MasterCard. The Coutts Silk Charge Card and the Centurion Card are famous charge cards.

<doc id="311291" wikidata="Q1351769" url="?curid=311291" title="Stressed Eric">
<text>Stressed Eric is an animated sitcom that was produced by Absolutely Productions for the BBC Two television channel in the United Kingdom and Television New Zealand. The series revolves around Eric Feeble, a middle class man who is always stressed because of his family, work, co-workers, etc. The show ran for two series in the UK, while its redubbed American version only received one series.

==Overview==
40-year-old Eric Feeble is still upset over his divorce two years before. He lives in a middle-class London house and is always kept under extreme amounts of pressure and stress from all aspects of life, which is represented by a throbbing vein in his temple. His two children, Brian and Claire, plague him with fear and worry daily. Claire is a frail 6-year-old who is allergic to virtually everything, including wheat, ponies, and spices; 10-year-old Brian has learning problems and has been kept back three straight years in school, and has an oral fixation and pica. The family&#x27;s au pair housekeeper, Maria, is an 18-year-old Portuguese woman with a serious drinking problem; despite Eric&#x27;s frequent attempts to keep her under control and focused, she stays passed-out drunk for hours at a time. His former wife Liz left him for a Buddhist but phones him up incessantly, which adds to his stress level. The next-door neighbours, the wealthy, successful, snobbish Perfect family, provide a constant and painful view of what his life could have been.

Eric&#x27;s workplace is absolutely no escape from his everyday problems. His boss, Paul Power (known as PP), is loud, rude and demanding; he has demoted Eric from Assistant Manager to a low-level clerk in an office sandwiched between the janitor&#x27;s closet and the men&#x27;s toilets. His secretary Alison is completely useless, spending all her &quot;working hours&quot; in personal phone calls and shrilling rudely at Eric when he requests her attention.

At the end of almost every episode, as the climax of events cause Eric&#x27;s stress to reach breaking point, the throbbing vein emerges from his temple and wraps itself around his neck, strangling and apparently killing him. It is the only fantastical element in the grounded setting of the series.

== Characters ==

=== Main ===
*Eric Feeble (Mark Heap) (Hank Azaria in U.S. version) – Stressed out divorced father of two children. Eric is a kind, well-meaning man who loves his children. Although bitter and sarcastic about many aspects of his life, Eric genuinely tries to make the best out of situation and deeply loves his children, going to great lengths to make them proud. However, he normally fails due to no fault of his own, and the rare times he actually does well, something always happens to ruin it.
*Claire Feeble (Morwenna Banks) – Daughter of Eric; allergic to just about everything, but an intelligent, curious, playful little girl. Her allergies require her to eat special regulation food, but she is always sneaking ordinary food which immediately swells her up.
*Brian Feeble (Gábor Csupó) – Son of Eric; has been held back in school for three years straight. He has pica and as a result, is always putting strange things in his mouth.
*Maria Gonzalez (Doon Mackichan) – The Feeble family&#x27;s teenaged punk-looking live-in au pair; she is Portuguese and always drunk or hung over.

The broadcast of the series on NBC in the United States replaced Mark Heap&#x27;s voice with that of Hank Azaria, who also serves as a producer for the dub, repurposing Eric as an American expatriate.

===Supporting===
*Liz (Rebecca Front) – Eric&#x27;s eccentric former wife.
*Caleb (Bill Nighy) – Liz&#x27;s boyfriend.
*Ray Perfect (Alexander Armstrong) – Snobbish and &quot;perfect&quot; next-door neighbour of Eric. Shares Eric&#x27;s workplace, but is senior and consistently praised for his fine work.
*Sue Perfect (Alison Steadman) – Snobbish wife of Mr. Perfect. Catchphrase: &quot;How &quot;art&quot; thou, Eric?&quot;
*Heather Perfect (Morwenna Banks) – Snobbish daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Perfect.
*Paul Power, a.k.a. P.P. (Geoffrey McGivern) – Boss of Eric who is usually very angry. Catchphrase: &quot;Double arseburgers, Eric!&quot;
*Alison Scabie (Doon Mackichan) – Eric&#x27;s useless secretary who spends all her time on the telephone gossiping to friends.
*Doc (Paul Shearer) – Eric&#x27;s dementedly relaxed doctor, more interested in chasing women than treating Eric. He is the closest thing Eric has to a best friend.
*Mrs. Wilson (Hayley Mills) – An old lady who slowly tries in vain to post a letter which always falls from her hand and into a drain, sometimes with Eric to blame. Catchphrase: &quot;Morning, Mister Eric. Just off to the post...&quot;
*Gordon Kennedy voices various characters.

== Episodes ==

=== Series 1 (1998) ===
This is the only series to broadcast in the United States.
=== Series 2 (2000) ===
==Broadcast and production==
The show was first broadcast on BBC2 in April 1998 and ran for two series. While BBC Worldwide was heavily involved in the production, international sales for the series were handled by ITEL.

ITEL pre-sold North American rights to the series to NBC in July 1998. These airings were adapted for American audiences with the lead character&#x27;s voice redubbed and re-worked as an American expatriate with several original lines changed for cultural purposes, a new opening sequence that reflects the changed storyline and some scenes cut for time constraints. Only three episodes were aired by NBC until the show was pulled from the network following low ratings.

&quot;Stressed Eric&quot; continued when Hibbert Ralph produced the second series. The second series was animated by Varga Studio instead. It also airs in Canada on kids Canadian channel YTV (as the channel aired most adult shows in the past), but with the US dub as well in a marathon sneak peek. It aired reruns on Play UK and in America on Comedy Central, but aired with the original UK dub. It also airs reruns on BBC Choice until 2003. The show also airs on TVNZ.

==Reception==
In a positive view, &quot;Variety&quot; noted that the lead character &quot;is so unfathomably pathetic that he makes Homer Simpson look like Bill Gates&quot; and was critical of the decision to redub the series in American English for the first series, but stated that the series was otherwise &quot;wry and smart&quot;.

Charles Solomon of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that the series &quot;seems to be trying to out-do &quot;South Park&quot; for sheer tastelessness in an animated series&quot; and that Azaria &quot;may be able to make Eric likable, but it&#x27;s going to be an uphill battle&quot; since &quot;the characters on &quot;Stressed Eric&quot; [...] come across as alienated, crass and nasty&quot;.

Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; expressed his surprise at the fact that the cartoon originally ran on the BBC—a broadcaster he felt &quot;a history of great TV&quot;—since &quot;the British cartoon seems mainly an imitation of American cartoon hits like Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, instead of the kind of thing the British do best&quot;. He also had a low opinion of the title character, calling him &quot;an imbecilic stumblebum who appears to deserve the bad things that happen to him&quot; and negatively comparing him to Homer Simpson.

Alan Pergament of the &quot;Buffalo News&quot; gave the programme a two-star rating. He hoped that &quot;Azaria&#x27;s narration will be a little slower than that of the British voice performer&quot; but remarked that &quot;Eric is such a bumbler and his life is so stressful that it isn&#x27;t much fun to watch&quot;. He also thought the comparison to &quot;South Park&quot; in the series&#x27; promos was foolish, noted that it ran against another Americanized version of a British series—&quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;—and remarked that &quot;as good as it is to get some original programming in the summer, &quot;Stressed Eric&quot; is so routine that it&#x27;s difficult to understand why it has won awards across the ocean.&quot;

==DVD release==

&quot;The Complete Stressed Eric Collection&quot; was released on DVD in the UK on 2 May 2011, with the following special features:

<text>Walter Horatio Pater (4 August 1839 – 30 July 1894) was an English essayist, art and literary critic, and fiction writer, regarded as one of the great stylists. His first and most often reprinted book, &quot;Studies in the History of the Renaissance&quot; (1873), revised as &quot;The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry&quot; (1877), in which he outlined his approach to art and advocated an ideal of the intense inner life, was taken by many as a manifesto (whether stimulating or subversive) of Aestheticism.

==Early life==
Born in Stepney in London&#x27;s East End, Walter Pater was the second son of Richard Glode Pater, a physician who had moved to London in the early 19th century to practise medicine among the poor. Dr Pater died while Walter was an infant and the family moved to Enfield. Walter attended Enfield Grammar School and was individually tutored by the headmaster.

In 1853 he was sent to The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, where the beauty of the cathedral made an impression that would remain with him all his life. He was fourteen when his mother, Maria Pater, died in 1854. As a schoolboy Pater read John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Painters&quot;, which helped inspire his lifelong attraction to the study of art and gave him a taste for well-crafted prose. He gained a school exhibition, with which he proceeded in 1858 to Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

As an undergraduate, Pater was a &quot;reading man&quot;, with literary and philosophical interests beyond the prescribed texts. Flaubert, Gautier, Baudelaire and Swinburne were among his early favourites. Visiting his aunt and sisters in Heidelberg, Germany, during the vacations, he learned German and began to read Hegel and the German philosophers. The scholar Benjamin Jowett was struck by his potential and offered to give him private lessons. In Jowett&#x27;s classes, however, Pater was a disappointment; he took a Second in &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot; in 1862. As a boy Pater had cherished the idea of entering the Anglican clergy, but at Oxford his faith in Christianity had been shaken. In spite of his inclination towards the ritual and aesthetic elements of the church, he had little interest in Christian doctrine and did not pursue ordination. After graduating, Pater remained in Oxford and taught Classics and Philosophy to private students. (His sister Clara Pater, a pioneer of women&#x27;s education, later taught ancient Greek and Latin at Somerville College, of which she was one of the co-founders.) Pater&#x27;s years of study and reading now paid dividends: he was offered a classical fellowship in 1864 at Brasenose on the strength of his ability to teach modern German philosophy, and he settled down to a university career.

==Career and writings==

===&quot;The Renaissance&quot;===

The opportunities for wider study and teaching at Oxford, combined with formative visits to the Continent – in 1865 he visited Florence, Pisa and Ravenna – meant that Pater&#x27;s preoccupations now multiplied. He became acutely interested in art and literature, and started to write articles and criticism. First to be printed was an essay on the metaphysics of Coleridge, &#x27;Coleridge&#x27;s Writings&#x27;, contributed anonymously in 1866 to the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;. A few months later his essay on Winckelmann (1867), an early expression of his intellectual and artistic idealism, appeared in the same review, followed by &#x27;The Poems of William Morris&#x27; (1868), expressing his admiration for romanticism. In the following years the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; printed his essays on Leonardo da Vinci (1869), Sandro Botticelli (1870), and Michelangelo (1871). The last three, with other similar pieces, were collected in his &quot;Studies in the History of the Renaissance&quot; (1873), renamed in the second and later editions &quot;The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry&quot;. The Leonardo essay contains Pater&#x27;s celebrated reverie on the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (&quot;probably still the most famous piece of writing about any picture in the world&quot;); the Botticelli essay was the first in English on this painter, contributing to the revival of interest in him; while the Winckelmann essay explored a temperament with whom Pater felt a strong affinity. An essay on &#x27;The School of Giorgione&#x27; (&quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, 1877), added to the third edition (1888), contains Pater&#x27;s much-quoted maxim &quot;All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music&quot; (i.e. the arts seek to unify subject-matter and form, and music is the only art in which subject and form are seemingly one). The final paragraphs of the 1868 William Morris essay were reworked as the book&#x27;s &#x27;Conclusion&#x27;.

This brief &#x27;Conclusion&#x27; was to be Pater&#x27;s most influential – and controversial – publication. It asserts that our physical lives are made up of scientific processes and elemental forces in perpetual motion, &quot;renewed from moment to moment but parting sooner or later on their ways&quot;. In the mind &quot;the whirlpool is still more rapid&quot;: a drift of perceptions, feelings, thoughts and memories, reduced to impressions &quot;unstable, flickering, inconstant&quot;, &quot;ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality&quot;; and &quot;with the passage and dissolution of impressions... [there is a] continual vanishing away, that strange, perpetual weaving and unweaving of ourselves&quot;. Because all is in flux, to get the most from life, we must learn to discriminate through &quot;sharp and eager observation&quot;: for 
Through such discrimination we may &quot;get as many pulsations as possible into the given time&quot;: &quot;To burn always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.&quot; Forming habits means failure on our part, for habit connotes the stereotypical. &quot;While all melts under our feet,&quot; Pater wrote, &quot;we may well catch at any exquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that seems by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment, or any stirring of the senses, or work of the artist&#x27;s hands. Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us in the brilliancy of their gifts is, on this short day of frost and sun, to sleep before evening.&quot; The resulting &quot;quickened, multiplied consciousness&quot; counters our insecurity in the face of the flux. Moments of vision may come from simple natural effects, as Pater notes elsewhere in the book: &quot;A sudden light transfigures a trivial thing, a weathervane, a windmill, a winnowing flail, the dust in the barn door; a moment – and the thing has vanished, because it was pure effect; but it leaves a relish behind it, a longing that the accident may happen again.&quot; Or they may come from &quot;intellectual excitement&quot;, from philosophy, science and the arts. Here we should &quot;be for ever testing new opinions, never acquiescing in a facile orthodoxy&quot;; and of these, a passion for the arts, &quot;a desire of beauty&quot;, has (in the summary of one of Pater&#x27;s editors) &quot;the greatest potential for staving off the sense of transience, because in the arts the perceptions of highly sensitive minds are already ordered; we are confronted with a reality already refined and we are able to reach the personality behind the work&quot;.

&quot;The Renaissance&quot;, which appeared to some to endorse amorality and &quot;hedonism&quot;, provoked criticism from conservative quarters, including disapproval from Pater&#x27;s former tutor at Queen&#x27;s College, from the chaplain at Brasenose College and from the Bishop of Oxford. Margaret Oliphant, reviewing the book in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, dismissed it as &quot;rococo Epicureanism&quot;, while George Eliot condemned it as &quot;quite poisonous in its false principles of criticism and false conceptions of life&quot;.

In 1874 Pater was turned down at the last moment by his erstwhile mentor Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol, for a previously-promised proctorship. In the 1980s, letters emerged documenting a &quot;romance&quot; with a nineteen-year-old Balliol undergraduate, William Money Hardinge, who had attracted unfavorable attention as a result of his outspoken homosexuality and blasphemous verse, and who later became a novelist. Many of Pater&#x27;s works focus on male beauty, friendship and love, either in a Platonic way or, obliquely, in a more physical way. Another undergraduate, W. H. Mallock, had passed the Pater-Hardinge letters to Jowett, who summoned Pater:

In 1876 Mallock parodied Pater&#x27;s message in a satirical novel &quot;The New Republic&quot;, depicting Pater as a typically effete English aesthete. The satire appeared during the competition for the Oxford Professorship of Poetry and played a role in convincing Pater to remove himself from consideration. A few months later Pater published what may have been a subtle riposte: &#x27;A Study of Dionysus&#x27; the outsider-god, persecuted for his new religion of ecstasy, who vanquishes the forces of reaction (&quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;, Dec. 1876).

===&quot;Marius the Epicurean&quot; and &quot;Imaginary Portraits&quot;===
Pater was now at the centre of a small but gifted circle in Oxford – he had tutored Gerard Manley Hopkins in 1866 and the two remained friends till September 1879 when Hopkins left Oxford – and he was gaining respect in the London literary world and beyond. Through Swinburne he met figures like Edmund Gosse, William Bell Scott, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He was an early friend and supporter of the young pre-Raphaelite painter Simeon Solomon. Conscious of his growing influence and aware that the &#x27;Conclusion&#x27; to his &quot;Renaissance&quot; could be misconstrued as amoral, he withdrew the essay from the second edition in 1877 (he was to reinstate it with minor modifications in the third in 1888) and now set about clarifying and exemplifying his ideas through fiction.

To this end he published in 1878 in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; an evocative semi-autobiographical sketch titled &#x27;Imaginary Portraits 1. The Child in the House&#x27;, about some of the formative experiences of his childhood – &quot;a work&quot;, as Pater&#x27;s earliest biographer put it, &quot;which can be recommended to anyone unacquainted with Pater&#x27;s writings, as exhibiting most fully his characteristic charm.&quot; This was to be the first of a dozen or so &quot;Imaginary Portraits&quot;, a genre and term Pater could be said to have invented and in which he came to specialise. These are not so much stories – plotting is limited and dialogue absent – as psychological studies of fictional characters in historical settings, often personifications of new concepts at turning-points in the history of ideas or emotion. Some look forward, dealing with innovation in the visual arts and philosophy; others look back, dramatising neo-pagan themes. Many are veiled self-portraits exploring dark personal preoccupations.

Planning a major work, Pater now resigned his teaching duties in 1882, though he retained his Fellowship and the college rooms he had occupied since 1864, and made a research visit to Rome. In his philosophical novel &quot;Marius the Epicurean&quot; (1885), an extended imaginary portrait set in the Rome of the Antonines, which Pater believed had parallels with his own century, he examines the &quot;sensations and ideas&quot; of a young Roman of integrity, who pursues an ideal of the &quot;aesthetic&quot; life – a life based on αἴσθησις, sensation, perception – tempered by asceticism. Leaving behind the religion of his childhood, sampling one philosophy after another, becoming secretary to the Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius, Marius tests his author&#x27;s theory of the stimulating effect of the pursuit of sensation and insight as an ideal in itself. The novel&#x27;s opening and closing episodes betray Pater&#x27;s continuing nostalgia for the atmosphere, ritual and community of the religious faith he had lost. &quot;Marius&quot; was favourably reviewed and sold well; a second edition came out in the same year. For the third edition (1892) Pater made extensive stylistic revisions.

In 1885, on the resignation of John Ruskin, Pater became a candidate for the Slade Professorship of Fine Art at Oxford University, but though in many ways the strongest of the field, he withdrew from the competition, discouraged by continuing hostility in official quarters. In the wake of this disappointment but buoyed by the success of &quot;Marius&quot;, he moved with his sisters from North Oxford (2 Bradmore Road), their home since 1869, to London (12 Earls Terrace, Kensington), where he was to live (outside term-time) till 1893.


From 1885 to 1887, Pater published four new imaginary portraits in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, each a study of misfits, men born out of their time, who bring disaster upon themselves – &#x27;A Prince of Court Painters&#x27; (1885) (on Watteau and Jean-Baptiste Pater), &#x27;Sebastian van Storck&#x27; (March 1886) (17th-century Dutch society and painting, and the philosophy of Spinoza), &#x27;Denys L&#x27;Auxerrois&#x27; (October 1886) (Dionysus and the medieval cathedral-builders), and &#x27;Duke Carl of Rosenmold&#x27; (1887) (the German Enlightenment). These were collected in the volume &quot;Imaginary Portraits&quot; (1887). Here Pater&#x27;s examination of the tensions between tradition and innovation, intellect and sensation, asceticism and aestheticism, social mores and amorality, becomes increasingly complex. Implied warnings against the pursuit of extremes in matters intellectual, aesthetic or sensual are unmistakable. The second portrait, &#x27;Sebastian van Storck&#x27;, a powerful critique of philosophical solipsism, has been described as Pater&#x27;s most subtle psychological study.

===&quot;Appreciations&quot;, &quot;Plato and Platonism&quot;, and &quot;An Imaginary Portrait&quot;===
In 1889 Pater published &quot;Appreciations, with an Essay on Style&quot;, a collection of previously-printed essays on literature. It was well received. &#x27;Style&#x27; (reprinted from the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, 1888) is a statement of his creed and methodology as a prose-writer, ending with the paradox &quot;If style be the man, it will be in a real sense &#x27;impersonal&#x27; &quot;. The volume also includes an appraisal of the poems of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, first printed in 1883, a few months after Rossetti&#x27;s death; &#x27;Aesthetic Poetry&#x27;, a revised version of the William Morris essay of 1868 minus its final paragraphs; and an essay on Thomas Browne, whose mystical, Baroque style Pater admired. The essay on Coleridge reprints &#x27;Coleridge&#x27;s Writings&#x27; (1866) but omits its explicitly anti-Christian passages; it adds paragraphs on Coleridge&#x27;s poetry that Pater had contributed to T.H. Ward&#x27;s &quot;The English Poets&quot; (1880). When he reworked his 1876 essay &#x27;Romanticism&#x27; as the &#x27;Postscript&#x27; to &quot;Appreciations&quot;, Pater removed its references to Baudelaire (now associated with the Decadent Movement), substituting Hugo&#x27;s name in their place. In the second edition of &quot;Appreciations&quot; (1890) he suppressed the essay &#x27;Aesthetic Poetry&#x27; – further evidence of his growing cautiousness in response to establishment criticism. All subsequent reprints of &quot;Appreciations&quot; (&quot;to the dismay of every reader since 1890&quot;, as Gerald Monsman put it) have followed the second edition.

In 1893 Pater and his sisters returned to Oxford (64 St Giles, now the site of Blackfriars Hall, a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford). He was now in demand as a lecturer. In this year appeared his book &quot;Plato and Platonism&quot;. Here and in other essays on ancient Greece Pater relates to Greek culture the romanticism-classicism dialectic which he had first explored in his essay &#x27;Romanticism&#x27; (1876). &quot;All through Greek history,&quot; he writes, &quot;we may trace, in every sphere of activity of the Greek mind, the action of these two opposing tendencies, the centrifugal and centripetal. The centrifugal – the Ionian, the Asiatic tendency – flying from the centre, throwing itself forth in endless play of imagination, delighting in brightness and colour, in beautiful material, in changeful form everywhere, its restless versatility driving it towards the development of the individual&quot;: and &quot;the centripetal tendency&quot;, drawing towards the centre, &quot;maintaining the Dorian influence of a severe simplification everywhere, in society, in culture&quot;. Harold Bloom noted that &quot;Pater praises Plato for Classic correctness, for a conservative centripetal impulse, against his [Pater&#x27;s] own Heraclitean Romanticism,&quot; but &quot;we do not believe him when he presents himself as a centripetal man&quot;. The volume, which also includes a sympathetic study of ancient Sparta (&#x27;Lacedaemon&#x27;, 1892), was praised by Jowett. &quot;The change that occurs between &quot;Marius&quot; and &quot;Plato and Platonism&quot;,&quot; writes Anthony Ward, &quot;is one from a sense of defeat in scepticism to a sense of triumph in it.&quot;

In the early summer of 1894 &#x27;The Child in the House&#x27; was for the first time issued in book form, in a limited edition of 250 copies, &quot;reprinted with loving care&quot; by the Daniel Press of Oxford, as &quot;An Imaginary Portrait&quot;, and described by Gosse as &quot;a precious toy for bibliomaniacs&quot;. It sold out in under an hour. &quot;I quite love your child,&quot; wrote Emily Daniel to Pater, presenting him with a copy. Pater in reply expressed pleasure in seeing his child &quot;so daintily attired&quot;.

On 30 July 1894, Pater died suddenly in his Oxford home of heart failure brought on by rheumatic fever, at the age of 54. He was buried at Holywell Cemetery, Oxford.

===&quot;Greek Studies&quot;, &quot;Miscellaneous Studies&quot;, &quot;Gaston de Latour&quot; and other posthumous volumes===
In 1895, a friend and former student of Pater&#x27;s, Charles Lancelot Shadwell, a Fellow and later Provost of Oriel, collected and published as &quot;Greek Studies&quot; Pater&#x27;s essays on Greek mythology, religion, art and literature. This volume contains a reverie on the boyhood of Hippolytus, &#x27;Hippolytus Veiled&#x27; (first published in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1889), which has been called &quot;the finest prose ever inspired by Euripides&quot;. In genre another &quot;imaginary portrait&quot;, the sketch illustrates a paradox central to Pater&#x27;s sensibility and writings: a leaning towards &quot;ascetic&quot; beauty apprehended sensuously. The volume also reprints Pater&#x27;s 1876 &#x27;Study of Dionysus&#x27;.

In the same year Shadwell assembled other uncollected pieces and published them as &quot;Miscellaneous Studies&quot;. This volume contains &#x27;The Child in the House&#x27; and another two obliquely self-revelatory Imaginary Portraits, &#x27;Emerald Uthwart&#x27; (first published in &quot;The New Review&quot; in 1892) and &#x27;Apollo in Picardy&#x27; (from &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, 1893) – the latter, like &#x27;Denys L&#x27;Auxerrois&#x27;, centering on a peculiarly Paterian preoccupation: the survival or reincarnation of pagan deities in the Christian era. Also included were Pater&#x27;s last (unfinished) essay, on Pascal, and two pieces that point to a revival in Pater&#x27;s final years of his earlier interest in Gothic cathedrals, sparked by regular visits to northern Europe with his sisters. Charles Shadwell &quot;in his younger days&quot; had been &quot;strikingly handsome, both in figure and feature&quot;, &quot;with a face like those to be seen on the finer Attic coins&quot;; he had been the unnamed inspiration of an unpublished early paper of Pater&#x27;s, &#x27;Diaphaneitè&#x27; (1864), a tribute to youthful beauty and intellect, the manuscript of which Pater gave to Shadwell. This piece Shadwell also included in &quot;Miscellaneous Studies&quot;. Shadwell had accompanied Pater on his 1865 visit to Italy, and Pater was to dedicate &quot;The Renaissance&quot; to him and to write a preface to Shadwell&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Purgatory of Dante Alighieri&quot; (1892).

In 1896 Shadwell edited and published seven chapters of Pater&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Gaston de Latour&quot;, set in turbulent late 16th-century France, the product of the author&#x27;s interest in French history, philosophy, literature, and art. Pater had conceived &quot;Marius&quot; as the first novel of &quot;a trilogy of works of similar character dealing with the same problems, under altered historical conditions&quot;; &quot;Gaston&quot; was to have been the second, while the third was to have been set in England in the late 18th century. In 1995 Gerald Monsman published &quot;Gaston de Latour: The Revised Text&quot;, re-editing the seven chapters and editing the remaining six which Shadwell and Clara Pater had withheld as too unfinished. &quot;Through the imaginary portrait of Gaston and Gaston&#x27;s historical contemporaries – Ronsard, Montaigne, Bruno, Queen Marguerite, King Henry III – Pater&#x27;s fantasia confronts and admonishes the Yellow Nineties, Oscar Wilde not least.&quot; In an 1891 review of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; in &quot;The Bookman&quot;, Pater had disapproved of Wilde&#x27;s distortion of Epicureanism: &quot;A true Epicureanism aims at a complete though harmonious development of man&#x27;s entire organism. To lose the moral sense therefore, for instance the sense of sin and righteousness, as Mr. Wilde&#x27;s heroes are bent on doing so speedily, as completely as they can, is ... to become less complex, to pass from a higher to a lower degree of development.&quot;

&quot;Essays from The Guardian&quot;, edited by Gosse, a selection of Pater&#x27;s anonymous 1886–1890 book-reviews from the journal also known as &#x27;The Church Guardian&#x27;, and an &quot;Uncollected Essays&quot; were privately printed in 1896 and 1903 respectively (the latter was republished as &quot;Sketches and Reviews&quot; in 1919). An &quot;Édition de luxe&quot; ten-volume &quot;Works of Walter Pater&quot;, with two volumes for &quot;Marius&quot; and including all but the pieces in &quot;Uncollected Essays&quot;, was issued in 1901; it was reissued, in plainer form, as the Library Edition in 1910. Pater&#x27;s works were frequently reprinted until the late 1920s.

== Influence ==
Toward the end of his life Pater&#x27;s writings were exercising a considerable influence. The principles of what would be known as the Aesthetic Movement were partly traceable to him, and his effect was particularly felt on one of the movement&#x27;s leading proponents, Oscar Wilde, who paid tribute to him in &quot;The Critic as Artist&quot; (1891). Among art critics influenced by Pater were Bernard Berenson, Roger Fry, Kenneth Clark and Richard Wollheim: among early literary Modernists, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, W. B. Yeats, Paul Valéry, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens; and Pater&#x27;s influence can be traced in the subjective, stream-of-consciousness novels of the early 20th century. In literary criticism, Pater&#x27;s emphasis on subjectivity and on the autonomy of the reader helped prepare the way for the revolutionary approaches to literary studies of the modern era. The Paterian sensibility is also apparent in the political philosophy of Michael Oakeshott. Among ordinary readers, idealists have found, and always will find inspiration in his desire &quot;to burn always with this hard, gemlike flame&quot;, in his pursuit of the &quot;highest quality&quot; in &quot;moments as they pass.&quot;
== Critical method ==
Pater&#x27;s critical method was outlined in the &#x27;Preface&#x27; to &quot;The Renaissance&quot; (1873) and refined in his later writings. In the &#x27;Preface&#x27;, he argues initially for a subjective, relativist response to life, ideas, art, as opposed to the drier, more objective, somewhat moralistic criticism practised by Matthew Arnold and others. &quot;The first step towards seeing one&#x27;s object as it really is,&quot; Pater wrote, &quot;is to know one&#x27;s own impression, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly. What is this song or picture, this engaging personality in life or in a book, to &quot;me&quot;?&quot; When we have formed our impressions we proceed to find &quot;the power or forces&quot; which produced them, the work&#x27;s &quot;virtue&quot;. &quot;Pater moves, in other words, from effects to causes, which are his real interest,&quot; noted Richard Wollheim. Among these causes are, pre-eminently, original temperaments and types of mind; but Pater &quot;did not confine himself to pairing off a work of art with a particular temperament. Having a particular temperament under review, he would ask what was the range of forms in which it might find expression. Some of the forms will be metaphysical doctrines, ethical systems, literary theories, religions, myths. Pater&#x27;s scepticism led him to think that in themselves all such systems lack sense or meaning – until meaning is conferred upon them by their capacity to give expression to a particular temperament.&quot;
== Style ==
Pater was much admired for his prose style, which he strove to make worthy of his aesthetic ideals, taking great pains and fastidiously correcting his work. He kept on his desk little squares of paper, each with its ideas, and shuffled them about attempting to form a sequence and pattern. &quot;I have known writers of every degree, but never one to whom the act of composition was such a travail and an agony as it was to Pater,&quot; wrote Edmund Gosse, who also described Pater&#x27;s method of composition: &quot;So conscious was he of the modifications and additions which would supervene that he always wrote on ruled paper, leaving each alternate line blank.&quot; He would then make a fair copy and repeat the process, sometimes paying to have drafts printed, to judge their effect. &quot;Unlike those who were caught by Flaubert&#x27;s theory of the unique word and the only epithet,&quot; wrote Osbert Burdett, &quot;Pater sought the sentence, and the sentence in relation to the paragraph, and the paragraph as a movement in the chapter. The numerous parentheses deliberately exchanged a quick flow of rhythm for pauses, for charming little eddies by the way.&quot; At the height of his powers as a writer, Pater discussed his principles of composition in the 1888 essay &#x27;Style&#x27;. A. C. Benson called Pater&#x27;s style &quot;absolutely distinctive and entirely new&quot;, adding, however, that &quot;it appeals, perhaps, more to the craftsman than to the ordinary reader.&quot; To G. K. Chesterton, Pater&#x27;s prose, serene and contemplative in tone, suggested a &quot;vast attempt at impartiality.&quot;

=== The &#x27;Oxford&#x27; Pater ===

== In literature ==
* W. Somerset Maugham &quot;The Magician&quot; (1908) Pater&#x27;s essay on the Mona Lisa is quoted by Oliver Haddo in his seduction of Margaret. (Penguin 1967 edition, pp 85–86)
* Wilde&#x27;s Lord Henry Wotton in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1890) incessantly and willfully misquotes Pater&#x27;s &quot;Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Marius&quot;. 
* Pater&#x27;s &quot;The Renaissance&quot; is praised as a &quot;wonderful new volume&quot; in Edith Wharton&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;, set in the 1870s.
* Pater is referred to in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; at the end of Chapter 41.
* In Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; (chap. 1), Professor Gottlieb tells his medical students (in his accented English), &quot;Before the next lab hour I shall be glad if you will read Pater&#x27;s &quot;Marius the Epicurean,&quot; to derife [&quot;sic&quot;] from it the calmness which iss [&quot;sic&quot;] the secret of laboratory skill.&quot;
* Lines from the &quot;Conclusion&quot; to Pater&#x27;s &quot;Renaissance&quot; are quoted among the sixth formers in Julian Mitchell&#x27;s 1982 play &quot;Another Country&quot;. 
* Pater, with several of his colleagues, appears as a minor character in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;The Invention of Love&quot;.
* Pater is the subject of a poem by Billy Collins titled &quot;The Great Walter Pater&quot;.
* Citations from Pater&#x27;s &quot;The Renaissance&quot; are sprinkled throughout Frederic Tuten&#x27;s novel &quot;The Adventures of Mao on the Long March&quot;.
* Arthur Conan Doyle uses Pater as a cultural marker in his 1898 novel &quot;The Tragedy of the Korosko&quot;. Discussing one of a party steaming up the Nile, he says &quot;Mr. Cecil Brown...was a young diplomatist from a Continental Embassy, a man slightly tainted with the Oxford manner, and erring upon the side of unnatural and inhuman refinement, but full of interesting talk and cultured thought...He chose Walter Pater for his travelling author, and sat all day, reserved but affable, under the awning, with his novel and his sketch-book upon a camp-stool beside him.&quot;
*H. L Mencken in his work The American Language mentions Pater twice as a contrast to common English usage in Britain.
*R. P. Lister poked gentle fun at Pater&#x27;s ideas in his poem &quot;The Gemlike Flame&quot;.
*Pater is referenced in Yukio Mishima’s Forbidden Colors, page 21 in the Alfred Marks translation. First edition, Knopf, New York, 1968.

<text>The intelligentsia is a status class composed of the university-educated people of a society who engage in the complex mental labours by which they critique, shape, and lead in the politics, policies, and culture of their society; as such, the intelligentsia consists of scholars, academics, teachers, journalists, and literary writers.

Conceptually, the intelligentsia status class arose in the late 18th century, during the Partitions of Poland (1772–1795). Etymologically, the 19th-century Polish intellectual Bronisław Trentowski coined the term (intellectuals) to identify and describe the university-educated and professionally active social stratum of the patriotic bourgeoisie; men and women whose intellectualism would provide moral and political leadership to Poland in opposing the cultural hegemony of the Russian Empire.

Before the Russian Revolution, the term () identified and described the status class of university-educated people whose cultural capital (schooling, education, and intellectual enlightenment) allowed them to assume the moral initiative and the practical leadership required in Russian national, regional, and local politics.

In practice, the status and social function of the intelligentsia varied by society. In Eastern Europe, the intellectuals were at the periphery of their societies and thus were deprived of political influence and access to the effective levers of political power and of economic development. In Western Europe, the intellectuals were in the mainstream of their societies and thus exercised cultural and political influence that granted access to the power of government office, such as the &quot;Bildungsbürgertum&quot;, the cultured bourgeoisie of Germany, as well as the professionals of Great Britain.

==Background==
In a society, the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; is a status class of intellectuals whose social functions, politics, and national interests are (ostensibly) distinct from the functions of government, commerce, and the military. In &quot;Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology&quot; (1921), the political economist Max Weber applied the term &quot;intelligentsia&quot; in chronological and geographical frames of reference, such as &quot;this Christian preoccupation with the formulation of dogmas was, in Antiquity, particularly influenced by the distinctive character of ‘intelligentsia’, which was the product of Greek education&quot;, thus the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; originated as a social class of educated people created for the greater benefit of society.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Polish word and the sociologic concept of the became a European usage to describe the social class of men and women who are the intellectuals of the countries of central and of eastern Europe; in Poland, the critical thinkers educated at university, in Russia, the nihilists who opposed traditional values in the name of reason and progress. In the late 20th century, the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu said that the intelligentsia has two types of workers: (i) intellectual workers who create knowledge (practical and theoretic) and (ii) intellectual workers who create cultural capital. Sociologically, the Polish translates to the in France and the in Germany.

==European history==

The intelligentsia existed as a social stratum in European societies before the term was coined in 19th-century Poland, to identify the intellectual people whose professions placed them outside the traditional workplaces and labours of the town-and-country social classes (royalty, aristocracy, bourgeoisie) of a monarchy; thus the are a social class native to the city. In their functions as a status class, the intellectuals realised the cultural development of cities, the dissemination of printed knowledge (literature, textbooks, newspapers), and the economic development of housing for rent (the tenement house) for the teacher, the journalist, and the civil servant.

In &quot;On Love of the fatherland&quot; (1844), the Polish philosopher Karol Libelt used the term , which was the status class, composed of scholars, teachers, lawyers, and engineers, &quot;et al.&quot; as the educated people of society who provide the moral leadership required to resolve the problems of society, hence the social function of the intelligentsia is to &quot;guide for the reason of their higher enlightenment.&quot;

In the 1860s, the journalist Pyotr Boborykin popularised the term () to identify and describe the Russian social stratum of people educated at university who engage in the intellectual occupations (law, medicine, engineering, the arts) who produce the culture and the dominant ideology by which society functions. According to the theory of Dr. Vitaly Tepikin, the sociological traits usual to the intelligentsia of a society are:

#advanced-for-their-time moral ideals, moral sensitivity to the neighbour, tact and gentleness in expression;
#productive mental work, and in continual self-education;
#patriotism based on faith in the people, and inexhaustible, self-less love for the small and the big motherlands;
#inherent creativity in every stratum of the intelligentsia, and a tendency to asceticism;
#an independent personality who speaks freely;
#a critical attitude towards the government, and public condemnation of injustice;
#loyalty to principle by conscience, grace under pressure, and tendency to self-denial;
#an ambiguous perception of reality, which leads to political fickleness that sometimes becomes conservatism;
#a sense of resentment, because politics and policies went unrealised; and withdrawal from the public sphere to the in-group;
#quarrels about art, ideas, and ideology, which divide the subgroups who compose the intelligentsia.

In &quot;The Rise of the Intelligentsia, 1750–1831&quot; (2008) Maciej Janowski said that the Polish intelligentsia were the think tank of the State, intellectual servants whose progressive social and economic policies decreased the social backwardness (illiteracy) of the Polish people, and also decreased Russian political repression in partitioned Poland.

===Poland===
====19th century====

In 1844 Poland, the term &quot;inteligencja&quot;, identifying the intellectuals of a society, first was used by the philosopher Karol Libelt, which he described as a status class of people characterised by intellect and Polish nationalism; qualities of mind, character, and spirit that made them natural leaders of the modern Polish nation. That the intelligentsia were aware of their social status and of their duties to society: Educating the youth with the nationalist objective to restore the Republic of Poland; preserving the Polish language; and love of the Fatherland.

Nonetheless, the writers Stanisław Brzozowski and Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński criticised Libelt&#x27;s ideological and messianic representation of a Polish republic, because it originated from the social traditionalism and the reactionary conservatism that pervaded Polish culture and impeded socio-economic progress. Consequent to the Imperial Prussian, Austrian, Swedish and Russian Partitions of Poland, the imposition of Tsarist cultural hegemony caused many of the political and cultural élites to participate in the Great Emigration (1831–70).

====Second World War====
After the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, the Nazis launched the extermination of the Polish intelligentsia, by way of the military operations of the Special Prosecution Book-Poland, the German AB-Aktion in Poland, the Intelligenzaktion, and the Intelligenzaktion Pommern. In eastern Poland, the Soviet Union proceeded with the extermination of the Polish intelligentsia with operations such as the Katyn massacre (April–May 1940), during which university professors, physicians, lawyers, engineers, teachers, military, policeman, writers and journalists were murdered.

==Russia==
===Imperial era===

The Russian also was a mixture of messianism and intellectual élitism, which the philosopher Isaiah Berlin described as follows: &quot;The phenomenon, itself, with its historical and literally revolutionary consequences, is, I suppose, the largest, single Russian contribution to social change in the world. The concept of intelligentsia must not be confused with the notion of intellectuals. Its members thought of themselves as united, by something more than mere interest in ideas; they conceived themselves as being a dedicated order, almost a secular priesthood, devoted to the spreading of a specific attitude to life.&quot;

The Idea of Progress, which originated in Western Europe during the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, became the principal concern of the intelligentsia by the mid-19th century; thus, progress social movements, such as the Narodniks, mostly consisted of intellectuals. The Russian philosopher Sergei Bulgakov said that the Russian intelligentsia was the creation of Peter, that they were the &quot;window to Europe through which the Western air comes to us, vivifying and toxic at the same time.&quot; Moreover, Bulgakov also said that the literary critic of Westernization, Vissarion Belinsky was the spiritual father of the Russian intelligentsia.

In 1860, there were 20,000 professionals in Russia and 85,000 by 1900.
Originally composed of educated nobles, the intelligentsia became dominated by &quot;raznochintsy&quot; (classless people) after 1861. In 1833, 78.9 per cent of secondary-school students were children of nobles and bureaucrats, by 1885 they were 49.1 per cent of such students. The proportion of commoners increased from 19.0 to 43.8 per cent, and the remaining percentage were the children of priests. In fear of an educated proletariat, Tsar Nicholas I limited the number of university students to 3,000 per year, yet there were 25,000 students, by 1894. Similarly the number of periodicals increased from 15 in 1855 to 140 periodical publications in 1885. The &quot;third element&quot; were professionals hired by zemstva. By 1900, there were 47,000 of them, most were liberal radicals.

Although Tsar Peter the Great introduced the Idea of Progress to Russia, by the 19th century, the Tsars did not recognize &quot;progress&quot; as a legitimate aim of the state, to the degree that Nicholas II said &quot;How repulsive I find that word&quot; and wished it removed from the Russian language.

===Bolshevik perspective===

In Russia, the Bolsheviks did not consider the status class of the to be a true social class, as defined in Marxist philosophy. In that time, the Bolsheviks used the Russian word (stratum) to identify and define the intelligentsia as a separating layer without an inherent class character.

In the creation of post-monarchic Russia, Lenin was firmly critical of the class character of the intelligentsia, commending the growth of &quot;the intellectual forces of the workers and the peasants&quot; will depose the &quot;bourgeoisie and their accomplices, intelligents, lackeys of capital who think that they are brain of the nation. In fact it is not brain, but dung&quot;. (На деле это не мозг, а говно)

The Russian Revolution of 1917 divided the intelligentsia and the social classes of Tsarist Russia. Some Russians emigrated, the political reactionaries joined the right-wing White movement for counter-revolution, some became Bolsheviks, and some remained in Russia and participated in the political system of the Soviet Union. In reorganizing Russian society, the Bolsheviks deemed non-Bolshevik intelligentsia class enemies and expelled them from society, by way of deportation on Philosophers&#x27; ships, forced labor in the gulag, and summary execution. The members of the Tsarist-era intelligentsia who remained in Bolshevik Russia (the USSR) were proletarianized. Although the Bolsheviks recognized the managerial importance of the intelligentsia to the future of Soviet Russia, the bourgeois origin of this stratum gave reason for distrust of their ideological commitment to Marxist philosophy and Bolshevik societal control.

===Soviet Union===

In the late Soviet Union the term &quot;intelligentsia&quot; acquired a formal definition of mental and cultural workers. There were subcategories of &quot;scientific-technical intelligentsia&quot; (научно-техническая интеллигенция) and &quot;creative intelligentsia&quot; (творческая интеллигенция).

Between 1917 and 1941, there was a massive increase in the number of engineering graduates: from 15,000 to over 250,000.

===Post-Soviet period===
In the post-Soviet period, the members of the former Soviet intelligentsia have displayed diverging attitudes towards the communist government. While the older generation of intelligentsia has attempted to frame themselves as victims, the younger generation, who were in their 30s when the Soviet Union collapsed, has not allocated so much space for the repressive experience in their self-narratives. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the popularity and influence of the intelligentsia has significantly declined. Therefore, it is typical for the post-Soviet intelligentsia to feel nostalgic for the last years of the Soviet Union (perestroika), which they often regard as the golden age of the intelligentsia.

Vladimir Putin has expressed his view on the social duty of intelligentsia in modern Russia.

We should all be aware of the fact that when revolutionary—not evolutionary—changes come, things can get even worse. The intelligentsia should be aware of this. And it is the intelligentsia specifically that should keep this in mind and prevent society from radical steps and revolutions of all kinds. We&#x27;ve had enough of it. We&#x27;ve seen so many revolutions and wars. We need decades of calm and harmonious development.
==Mass intelligentsia==
In the 20th century, from the status class term &quot;Intelligentsia&quot;, sociologists derived the term &quot;mass intelligentsia&quot; to describe the populations of educated adults, with discretionary income, who pursue intellectual interests by way of book clubs and cultural associations, etc. That sociological term was made popular usage by the writer Melvyn Bragg, who said that mass intelligentsia conceptually explains the popularity of book clubs and literary festivals that otherwise would have been of limited intellectual interests to most people from the middle class and from the working class.

In the book &quot;Campus Power Struggle&quot; (1970), the sociologist Richard Flacks addressed the concept of mass intelligentsia:

==Related concepts ==
The concept of free-floating intelligentsia, coined by Alfred Weber and elaborated by Karl Mannheim, closely relates to the intelligentsia. It refers to an intellectual class that operates independently of social class constraints, allowing for a critical and unbiased perspective. This intellectual autonomy is a defining characteristic of the intelligentsia.

It maintains partnerships with numerous arts organizations in Boston, including the Celebrity Series of Boston, Fiddlehead Theatre Company, Express Yourself, and more.

== History ==
When the Wang Theatre first opened in 1925, it was called the Metropolitan Theatre. After 30 years as the Metropolitan Theatre, the venue was called the Music Hall, then the Metropolitan Center. In 1983, An and Lorraine Wang donated the funds to renovate the theatre, and it became the Wang Center for the Performing Arts. The Wang Theatre is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and with 3,600+ seats, it is one of the five largest stages in the country. The Wang Center began managing and operating the Shubert Theatre in 1996 when it entered a 40-year lease agreement with the venue. In 2006, the Wang Center became the Citi Performing Arts Center after establishing a 10-year partnership with Citigroup. In 2016, the Citi Performing Arts Center became the Boch Center following the announcement of a long-term partnership with the Boch family. In the past, it also managed the booking and preservation of the Emerson Colonial Theatre and the Strand Theatre.

== Programming ==
The Boch Center hosts a variety of performances and events at the Wang and Shubert Theatres, including theatre, dance, comedy, opera, classical and popular music concerts, and Broadway shows. The center maintains partnerships with other Boston arts nonprofits such as Fiddlehead Theatre Company, Handel and Haydn Society, A.R.T., Celebrity Series of Boston, Huntington Theatre Company, World Music, Dance Umbrellas, and Express Yourself.

The Wang and Shubert Theatres also host special events, such as corporate conferences, award ceremonies, galas, weddings, and more. They are also used as locations for movie filming. Movies filmed at the Wang Theatre include &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (2016), &quot;American Hustle&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther 2&quot;, &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;, and &quot;The Great Debaters&quot;.

== Nonprofit Work ==
In 1988, the Education Department at the Boch Center was founded, and the following year the Walter Suskind Memorial Education Fund was established. The nonprofit arts education initiatives at the center include the City Spotlights Leadership Program, Teen Council, Target Arts, Interactive Readings Stories Alive, and Ticket Access. City Spotlights Leadership Program is a seven-week summer employment program for teens in the Boston area. In 2016, the program reached 61 students from 30 different high schools and 13 Boston and Everett neighborhoods. The program includes arts and leadership training, community advocacy, and performance. Teen Leadership Council brings together a smaller group of teens from greater Boston for year-round programming where teens create original performance pieces, facilitate workshops, advocate for social change, and volunteer in the community. Founded in 2009 in partnership with Boston Public Schools, the Target Arts Program is an artist residency program funded by Target Corporation. It provides an in-depth arts residency at four different Boston schools each year. The Interactive Reading: Stories Alive program provides interactive storytelling to children in various Boston neighborhoods. The center&#x27;s Ticket Access program provides tickets to roughly 3,000 community organizations and schools in Greater Boston each year.

ArtWeek Boston is another nonprofit initiative produced by the Boch Center. This bi-annual, 10-day creative festival features more than 150 unique and creative experiences that are hands-on, interactive or offer behind-the-scenes access to artists or the creative process. It is presented by Highland Street Foundation.

<text>The Wang Theatre is a theatre in Boston. It originally opened in 1925 as the Metropolitan Theatre and was later renamed the Music Hall. It was designed by Clarence Blackall and is located at 252–272 Tremont Street in the Boston Theatre District. The theatre is operated as part of the Boch Center. The theatre was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1990.

==Metropolitan Theatre==
The structure was originally known as the Metropolitan Theatre when it opened in 1925. The Metropolitan Theatre was developed by Max Shoolman and designed by architect Clarence Blackall, with the assistance of Detroit theatre architect C. Howard Crane. It seats more than 3,600 people.

==Music Hall==
In 1962 it became the home of the Boston Ballet and was renamed the Music Hall. During the 1960s and 1970s, audiences could see the Stuttgart Opera, the Metropolitan Opera, Bolshoi Ballet and Kirov Ballet as well as popular movies and performing artists. With time though, they could no longer attract the large touring companies because of the size of their stage as well as their outdated production facilities. Converted to a non-profit center in 1980 and renamed the &quot;Metropolitan Center&quot;, they were able to attract theatrical performances again.

Bob Marley and the Wailers&#x27; 1978 concert at the Music Hall was released in 2015 in honor of Bob Marley&#x27;s 70th birthday as Easy Skanking in Boston &#x27;78.

==Wang Center==

In 1983, Dr. An Wang made a very large donation and the Wang Center was born. From 1989–1992, $9.8 million was raised to restore the Theatre to &quot;its glory days of the 1920s&quot;. Boston based architecture firm Finegold Alexander &amp; Associates restored the theatre with Conrad Schmitt Studios performing the elegant decoration, gilded moldings, murals, scagliola and marbleized surfaces.

In 2008, the Citi Performing Arts Center announced a co-booking arrangement with The Madison Square Garden Company for the Wang Theatre.

The lobby was used in the movies &quot;American Hustle&quot;, for the live band performance and casino scenes, and &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;, as part of the house in which Jack Nicholson&#x27;s character lived. It was also used for numerous scenes in the ABC TV pilot &quot;Gilded Lilys&quot;.

<text>Reginald Charles Hill FRSL (3 April 193612 January 2012) was an English crime writer and the winner in 1995 of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association Cartier Diamond Dagger for Lifetime Achievement. He was inducted into the prestigious Detection Club in 1978.

== Biography ==
Hill was born to a &quot;very ordinary&quot; family. His father, Reg Hill, was a professional footballer. His mother was a fan of Golden Age crime writers, and he discovered the genre while fetching her library books. He passed the eleven plus exam and attended Carlisle Grammar School where he excelled in English. After National Service (1955–57) and studying English at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford (1957–60), he worked as a teacher for many years, becoming a senior lecturer at Doncaster College of Education. In 1980 he retired from salaried work to devote himself full-time to writing.

Hill is best known for his more than 20 novels featuring the Yorkshire detectives Andrew Dalziel, Peter Pascoe and Edgar Wield. The characters were used by the BBC in the &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; series, in which Dalziel was played by Warren Clarke, Pascoe by Colin Buchanan, and Wield by David Royle. He also wrote more than 30 other novels, including five featuring Joe Sixsmith, a black machine operator turned private detective in a fictional Luton. Novels originally published under the pseudonyms of Patrick Ruell, Dick Morland, and Charles Underhill have now appeared under his own name. Hill was also a writer of short stories and ghost tales.

Hill&#x27;s novels employ various structural devices, such as presenting parts of the story in non-chronological order or alternating with sections from a novel supposedly written by Peter&#x27;s wife, Ellie Pascoe (née Soper). He also frequently selected one writer or one work of art to use as a central organizing element of a given novel, such as one novel being a pastiche of Jane Austen&#x27;s works, or another featuring elements of classical Greek myth. The novella &quot;One Small Step&quot; (dedicated to &quot;you, dear readers, without whom the writing would be in vain, and to you, still dearer purchasers, without whom the eating would be infrequent&quot;) is set in the future, and deals with the EuroFed Police Commissioner Pascoe and retired Dalziel investigating the first murder on the moon. The duo do not always &quot;get their man&quot;, with at least one novel ending with the villain getting away and another strongly implying that while Dalziel and Pascoe are unable to convict anyone, a series of unrelated accidents actually included at least one unprovable instance of murder.

Hill commented in 1986:
I still recall with delight as a teen-ager making the earth-shaking discovery that many of the great &quot;serious novelists,&quot; classical and modern, were as entertaining and interesting as the crime-writers I already loved. But it took another decade of maturation to reverse the equation and understand that many of the crime writers I had decided to grow out of were still as interesting and entertaining as the &quot;serious novelists&quot; I now revered.
Hill died at his home in Ravenglass, Cumbria, on 12 January 2012 after suffering a brain tumour.

<text>Aripiprazole, sold under the brand name Abilify, among others, is an atypical antipsychotic primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder; other uses include as an add-on treatment for major depressive disorder and tic disorders. Aripiprazole is taken by mouth or via injection into a muscle. A Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia.
Common side effects include restlessness, insomnia, transient weight gain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, and mild sedation. Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, and anaphylaxis. It is not recommended for older people with dementia-related psychosis due to an increased risk of death. In pregnancy, there is evidence of possible harm to the fetus. It is not recommended in women who are breastfeeding. It has not been very well studied in people less than 18 years old.
Aripiprazole was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 106th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Medical uses ==
Aripiprazole is primarily used for the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

=== Schizophrenia ===
The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for treating psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people recommended aripiprazole as a second-line treatment after risperidone for people between 15 and 17 who are having an acute exacerbation or recurrence of psychosis or schizophrenia. A 2014 NICE review of the depot formulation of the drug found that it might have a role in treatment as an alternative to other depot formulations of second-generation antipsychotics for people who have trouble taking medication as directed or who prefer it.

A 2014 Cochrane review comparing aripiprazole and other atypical antipsychotics found that it is difficult to determine differences as data quality is poor. A 2011 Cochrane review comparing aripiprazole with placebo concluded that high dropout rates in clinical trials, and a lack of outcome data regarding general functioning, behavior, mortality, economic outcomes, or cognitive functioning make it difficult to definitively conclude that aripiprazole is useful for the prevention of relapse. A Cochrane review found only low-quality evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia. Accordingly, part of its methodology on quality of evidence is based on the quantity of qualified studies.

A 2013 review placed aripiprazole in the middle range of 15 antipsychotics for effectiveness, approximately as effective as haloperidol and quetiapine and slightly more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine, with better tolerability compared to the other antipsychotic drugs (4th best for reducing weight gain, 5th best for reducing extrapyramidal symptoms, best for reducing prolactin levels, 2nd best for prolongated QTc interval, and 5th best for sedative symptoms). The authors concluded that for acute psychotic episodes, aripiprazole results in benefits in some aspects of the condition.

In 2013 the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry recommended aripiprazole for the treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia as a Grade 1 recommendation and evidence level A.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology similarly recommends that all persons presenting with psychosis receive treatment with an antipsychotic and that such treatment should continue for at least 1–2 years, as &quot;There is no doubt that antipsychotic discontinuation is strongly associated with relapse during this period&quot;. The guideline further notes that &quot;Established schizophrenia requires continued maintenance with doses of antipsychotic medication within the recommended range (Evidence level A)&quot;.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry suggest that there is little difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics in the prevention of relapse, and recommend that the specific choice of antipsychotic be chosen based on each person&#x27;s preference and side effect profile. The latter group recommends switching to aripiprazole when excessive weight gain is encountered during treatment with other antipsychotics.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
Aripiprazole is effective for the treatment of acute manic episodes of bipolar disorder in adults, children, and adolescents. Used as maintenance therapy, it is useful for the prevention of manic episodes but is not useful for bipolar depression. Thus, it is often used in combination with an additional mood stabilizer; however, co-administration with a mood stabilizer increases the risk of extrapyramidal side effects. In September 2014, aripiprazole had a UK marketing authorization for up to twelve weeks of treatment for moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder in young people aged thirteen and older. Aripiprazole in low doses of 2.5 mg can cause mania in those with Bipolar disorder.

=== Depression ===
Aripiprazole is an effective add-on treatment for major depressive disorder; however, there is a greater rate of side effects such as weight gain and movement disorders. The overall benefit is small to moderate and its use appears to neither improve quality of life nor functioning. Aripiprazole may interact with some antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that are metabolized by CYP2D6. There are known interactions with fluoxetine and paroxetine and it appears lesser interactions with sertraline, escitalopram, citalopram and fluvoxamine. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase aripiprazole concentrations to 2–3 times their normal level. When strong CYP2D6 SSRIs (such as fluoxetine, paroxetine) are co-administered, the FDA recommends dose monitoring, although it is not clear the SSRI dose should be lowered.

=== Autism ===
Short-term data (8 weeks) shows reduced irritability, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech, and stereotypy, but no change in lethargic behaviours. Adverse effects include weight gain, sleepiness, drooling, and tremors. It is suggested that children and adolescents need to be monitored regularly while taking this medication to evaluate if this treatment option is still effective after long-term use and note if side effects are worsening. Further studies are needed to understand if this drug is helpful for children after long-term use.

=== Tic disorders ===
Aripiprazole is approved for the treatment of Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders. It is effective, safe, and well-tolerated for this use per systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

=== Obsessive-compulsive disorder ===
A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that add-on therapy with low-dose aripiprazole is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that does not improve with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) alone. The conclusion was based on the results of two relatively small, short-term trials, each of which demonstrated improvements in symptoms. However, aripiprazole is cautiously recommended by a 2017 review on antipsychotics for OCD. Aripiprazole is not currently approved for the treatment of OCD and is instead used off-label for this indication. Depending on the dose, aripiprazole can increase impulse control issues in a small percentage of people. The FDA Drug Safety Communication warned about this side effect.

===Available forms===
Aripiprazole is available in the form of oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, oral solutions, oral films, and as injectables for intramuscular administration. It is also available in the form of aripiprazole lauroxil, a lipophilic ester prodrug of aripiprazole for use as a long-acting injectable.

== Contraindications ==
Contraindications to aripiprazole include known hypersensitivity to aripiprazole, among others.

== Adverse effects ==
A 2024 study indicated it was found to have the highest hazard ratio among antipsychotics associated with dementia risk: with a hazard ratio of 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.99-9.81) for all cause dementia; the risk appeared to be elevated when the medication was administered in long-acting injectable form compared to oral administration. This elevated risk may be due to the high rate of oral medication non-adherence in schizophrenia patients.

In the elderly with dementia, there is an increased risk of death.

In children, adolescents, and young adults, there is an increased risk of suicide.

In adults, side effects with greater than 10% incidence include weight gain, mania, headache, akathisia, insomnia, delirium, and gastrointestinal effects like nausea, constipation, and lightheadedness. Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose. A strong desire to gamble, binge eat, shop, and engage in sexual activity may also occur rarely. These urges can be uncontrollable.

Uncontrolled movement such as restlessness, tremors, and muscle rigidity may occur.

=== Discontinuation ===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.

There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis as a part of a withdrawal syndrome. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

== Overdose ==
Children or adults who ingested acute overdoses have usually manifested central nervous system depression ranging from mild sedation to coma; serum concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in these people were elevated by up to 3–4 fold over normal therapeutic levels; as of 2008, no deaths had been recorded.

== Interactions ==
Aripiprazole is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Coadministration with medications that inhibit (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) or induce (e.g. carbamazepine) these metabolic enzymes are known to increase and decrease, respectively, plasma levels of aripiprazole.

Precautions should be taken in people with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics along with other medications that affect blood sugar levels and should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. The liquid form (oral solution) of this medication may contain up to 15 grams of sugar per dose.

Antipsychotics like aripiprazole and stimulant medications, such as amphetamine, are traditionally thought to have opposing effects because both drugs affect dopaminergic neurons. However, both stimulants and antipsychotics lead to increases in synaptic dopamine levels. In antipsychotics, this is caused by the inhibition of dopamine autoreceptors as well as the effects of antipsychotics on non-dopaminergic receptors, while in amphetamine this is caused by non-competitive inhibition of dopamine reuptake and agonism of intracellular TAAR1. Therefore, aripiprazole may interact with amphetamine to synergistically increase postsynaptic levels of dopamine. This interaction frequently occurs in the setting of comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (for which stimulants are commonly prescribed) and off-label treatment of aggression with antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has been reported to provide some benefit in improving cognitive functioning in people with ADHD without other psychiatric comorbidities, though the results have been disputed. The combination of antipsychotics like aripiprazole with stimulants should not be considered an absolute contraindication.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===


Aripiprazole&#x27;s mechanism of action is different from those of the other FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and risperidone). It shows differential engagement at the dopamine receptor (D2). Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at dopamine D2 receptors, a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, and an antagonist or very weak partial agonist at 5-HT2A receptors.

It appears to show predominantly partial agonistic activity on postsynaptic D2 receptors and partial agonist activity on presynaptic D2 receptors, D3, and partially D4 and is a partial activator of serotonin (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7). It also shows lower effect on histamine (H1), as well as the serotonin transporter. Aripiprazole acts by modulating neurotransmission overactivity of dopamine, which is thought to mitigate schizophrenia symptoms.

As a pharmacologically unique antipsychotic with pronounced functional selectivity, characterization of this dopamine D2 partial agonist (with an intrinsic activity of ~50%) as being similar to a full agonist but at a reduced level of activity presents a misleading oversimplification of its actions; for example, among other effects, aripiprazole has been shown, in vitro, to bind to and/or induce receptor conformations (i.e., facilitate receptor shapes) in such a way as to not only prevent receptor internalization (and, thus, lower receptor density) but even to lower the rate of receptor internalization below that of neurons not in the presence of agonists (including dopamine) or antagonists. It is often the nature of partial agonists, including aripiprazole, to display a stabilizing effect (such as on mood in this case) with agonistic activity when there are low levels of endogenous neurotransmitters (such as dopamine) and antagonistic activity in the presence of high levels of agonists associated with events such as mania, psychosis, and drug use. In addition to aripiprazole&#x27;s partial agonism and functional selectivity characteristics, its effectiveness may be mediated by its very high dopamine D2 receptor occupancy (approximately 31%, 44%, 75%, 80%, and 95% at daily dosages of 0.5 mg, 2 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg respectively) Aripiprazole has been characterized as possessing predominantly partial agonist activity on postsynaptic D2 receptors and partial agonist activity on presynaptic D2 receptors; however, while this explanation intuitively explains the drug&#x27;s efficacy as an antipsychotic, as the degree of agonism is a function of more than a drug&#x27;s inherent properties as well as in vitro demonstration of aripiprazole&#x27;s partial agonism in cells expressing postsynaptic (D2L) receptors, it was noted that &quot;It is unlikely that the differential actions of aripiprazole as an agonist, antagonist, or partial agonist were entirely due to differences in relative D2 receptor expression since aripiprazole was an antagonist in cells with the highest level of expression (4.6 pmol/mg) and a partial agonist in cells with an intermediate level of expression (0.5–1 pmol/mg). Instead, the current data are most parsimoniously explained by the &quot;functional selectivity&quot; hypothesis of Lawler et al. (1999)&quot;. Aripiprazole is also a partial agonist of the D3 receptor. In healthy human volunteers, D2 and D3 receptor occupancy levels are high, with average levels ranging between approximately 75% at 2 mg/day to approximately 95% at 40 mg/day. Most atypical antipsychotics bind preferentially to extrastriatal receptors, but aripiprazole appears to be less preferential in this regard, as binding rates are high throughout the brain.

Aripiprazole is also a partial agonist of the postsynaptic serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (intrinsic activity = 68%). a PET scan study of 12 patients receiving doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg found 5-HT1A receptor occupancy to be only 16% compared to ~90% for D2. It is a very weak partial agonist of the Postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor (intrinsic activity = 12.7%). The drug differs from other atypical antipsychotics in having higher affinity for the D2 receptor than for the 5-HT2A receptor. At the 5-HT2B receptor, aripiprazole has both great binding affinity and acts as a potent inverse agonist, &quot;Aripiprazole decreased PI hydrolysis from a basal level of 61% down to a low of 30% at 1000 nM, with an EC50 of 11 nM&quot;. Unlike other antipsychotics, aripiprazole is a high-efficacy partial agonist of the postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptor (intrinsic activity = 82%) this property may underlie the minimal weight gain seen in the course of therapy, however if used while taking antidepressants it will become a functional antagonist and increase weight gain. At the presynaptic 5-HT7 receptor, aripiprazole is a very weak partial agonist with barely measurable intrinsic activity, and hence is a functional antagonist of this receptor. Aripiprazole also shows lower but likely clinically insignificant affinity for a number of other sites such as the serotonin transporter, while it has negligible affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors

Since the actions of aripiprazole differ markedly across receptor systems aripiprazole was sometimes an antagonist (e.g., at 5-HT6), sometimes an inverse agonist (e.g., 5-HT2B), sometimes a partial agonist (e.g., D2S, D3S, D4S, D2L). Aripiprazole was frequently found to be a partial agonist or full agonist, with an intrinsic activity that could be low (5-HT2A, 5-HT7), intermediate (D2L, 5-HT1A), or high (5-HT2C). This mixture of agonist actions at D2-dopamine receptors is consistent with the hypothesis that aripiprazole has &quot;functionally selective&quot; actions. The &quot;functional-selectivity&quot; hypothesis proposes that a mixture of agonist/partial agonist/antagonist actions are likely. According to this hypothesis, agonists may induce structural changes in receptor conformations that are differentially &quot;sensed&quot; by the local complement of G proteins to induce a variety of functional actions depending upon the precise cellular milieu. The diverse actions of aripiprazole at D2-dopamine receptors are clearly cell-type specific (e.g., agonism, antagonism, partial agonism), and are most parsimoniously explained by the &quot;functional selectivity&quot; hypothesis.

Since 5-HT2C receptors have been implicated in the control of depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and appetite, postsynaptic partial agonism at the 5-HT2C receptor might be associated with therapeutic potential in obsessive-compulsive disorder, obesity, and depression. 5-HT2C agonism has been demonstrated to induce anorexia via enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission via activation of postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptors; it is conceivable that the 5-HT2C partial agonist actions of aripiprazole may, thus, be partly responsible for the minimal weight gain associated with this compound in clinical trials. In terms of potential action as an antiobsessional agent, it is worthwhile noting that a variety of 5-HT2A/5-HT2C agonists have shown promise as antiobsessional agents, yet many of these compounds are hallucinogenic. Aripiprazole has a favorable pharmacological profile in being a 5-HT2C partial agonist. Based on this profile, one can predict that aripiprazole may have antiobsessional and anorectic actions in humans.

Wood and Reavill&#x27;s (2007) review of published and unpublished data proposed that, at therapeutically relevant doses, aripiprazole may act essentially as a selective partial agonist of the D2 receptor without significantly affecting the majority of serotonin receptors. A positron emission tomography imaging study found that 10 to 30 mg/day aripiprazole resulted in 85 to 95% occupancy of the D2 receptor in various brain areas (putamen, caudate, ventral striatum) versus 54 to 60% occupancy of the 5-HT2A receptor and only 16% occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor. It has been suggested that the low occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor by aripiprazole may have been an erroneous measurement however.

Aripiprazole acts by modulating neurotransmission overactivity on the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, which is thought to be a cause of positive schizophrenia symptoms. Due to its partial agonist activity on D2L receptors, aripiprazole may also increase dopaminergic activity to optimal levels in the mesocortical pathways where it is reduced.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Aripiprazole displays linear kinetics and has an elimination half-life of approximately 75 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved in about 14 days. Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) is achieved 3–5 hours after oral dosing. Bioavailability of the oral tablets is about 90% and the drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolization (dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and &quot;N&quot;-dealkylation), principally by the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Its only known active metabolite is dehydro-aripiprazole, which typically accumulates to approximately 40% of the aripiprazole concentration. The parenteral drug is excreted only in traces, and its metabolites, active or not, are excreted via feces and urine.

== Chemistry ==
Aripiprazole belongs to the chemical class of drugs called 2,3-dichlorophenylpiperazines and is chemically related to cariprazine, nefazodone, etoperidone, and trazodone. It is unusual in having twelve known crystalline polymorphs.

== History ==
Aripiprazole was discovered in 1988 by scientists at the Japanese firm Otsuka Pharmaceutical and was called OPC-14597. It was first published in 1995. Otsuka initially developed the drug, and partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in 1999 to complete development, obtain approvals, and market aripiprazole.

It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for schizophrenia in November 2002, and by the European Medicines Agency in June 2004; for acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder on 1 October 2004; as an adjunct for major depressive disorder on 20 November 2007; and to treat irritability in children with autism on 20 November 2009. Likewise it was approved for use as a treatment for schizophrenia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia in May 2003.

Aripiprazole has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of both acute manic and mixed episodes, in people older than ten years.

In 2006, the FDA required manufacturers to add a black box warning to the label, warning that older people who were given the drug for dementia-related psychosis were at greater risk of death.

In 2007, aripiprazole was approved by the FDA for the treatment of unipolar depression when used adjunctively with an antidepressant medication. That same year, BMS settled a case with the US government in which it paid $515 million; the case covered several drugs but the focus was on BMS&#x27;s off-label marketing of aripiprazole for children and older people with dementia.

In 2011 Otsuka and Lundbeck signed a collaboration to develop a depot formulation of aripiprazole.

As of 2013, Abilify had annual sales of . In 2013 BMS returned marketing rights to Otsuka, but kept manufacturing the drug. Also in 2013, Otsuka and Lundbeck received US and European marketing approval for an injectable depot formulation of aripiprazole.

Otsuka&#x27;s US patent on aripiprazole expired on 20 October 2014, but due to a pediatric extension, a generic did not become available until 20 April 2015. Barr Laboratories (now Teva Pharmaceuticals) initiated a patent challenge under the Hatch-Waxman Act in March 2007. On 15 November 2010, this challenge was rejected by the U.S. District Court in New Jersey.

Otsuka&#x27;s European patent EP0367141 which would have expired on 26 October 2009, was extended by a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) to 26 October 2014., The UK Intellectual Property Office decided on 4 March 2015 that the SPC could not be further extended by six months under Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. Even if the decision is successfully appealed, protection in Europe will not extend beyond 26 April 2015.

From April 2013 to March 2014, sales of Abilify amounted to almost $6.9 billion.

In April 2015, the FDA announced the first generic versions. In October 2015, aripiprazole lauroxil, a prodrug of aripiprazole that is administered via intramuscular injection once every four to six weeks for the treatment of schizophrenia, was approved by the FDA.

In 2016, BMS settled cases with 42 US states that had charged BMS with off-label marketing to older people with dementia; BMS agreed to pay $19.5 million.

In November 2017, the FDA approved Abilify Mycite, a digital pill containing a sensor intended to record when its consumer takes their medication.

A long-acting injectable version of aripiprazole was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar disorder 1 and schizophrenia in April 2023.

In 2024, the European Commission approved the 2 month long-acting injectable formulation of aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. This came after the 1 month long-acting injectable formulation lost drug exclusivity status in the US and Europe (the market is now open to generics).

=== Legal status ===
=== Classification ===
Aripiprazole has been described as the prototypical third-generation antipsychotic, as opposed to first-generation (typical) antipsychotics like haloperidol and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics like clozapine. It has received this classification due to its partial agonism of dopamine receptors, and is the first of its kind in this regard among antipsychotics, which before aripiprazole acted only as dopamine receptor antagonists. The introduction of aripiprazole has led to a paradigm shift from a dopamine antagonist-based approach to a dopamine agonist-based approach for antipsychotic drug development.

=== Brand names ===
Brand names of aripiprazole include Abilify, Aristada (as aripiprazole lauroxil), Arip MT, Explemed, and Arivitae, among others.

== Research ==

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
Aripiprazole was under development for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but development for this indication was discontinued. A 2017 meta review found only preliminary evidence (studies with small sample sizes and methodological problems) for aripiprazole in the treatment of ADHD. A 2013 systematic review of aripiprazole for ADHD similarly reported that there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness to support aripiprazole as a treatment for the condition. Although all 6 non-controlled open-label studies in the review reported effectiveness, two small randomized controlled trials found that aripiprazole did not significantly decrease ADHD symptoms. A high rate of adverse effects with aripiprazole such as weight gain, sedation, and headache was noted. Most research on aripiprazole for ADHD is in children and adolescents. Evidence on aripiprazole specifically for adult ADHD appears to be limited to a single case report.

=== Substance dependence ===
Aripiprazole has been studied for the treatment of amphetamine dependence and other substance use disorders, but more research is needed to support aripiprazole for these potential uses. Available evidence of aripiprazole for amphetamine dependence is mixed. Some studies have reported attenuation of the effects of amphetamines by aripiprazole, whereas other studies have reported both enhancement of the effects of amphetamines and increased use of amphetamines by aripiprazole. As such, aripiprazole may not only be ineffective but potentially harmful for treatment of amphetamine dependence, and caution is warranted with regard to its use for such purposes.

<doc id="311332" wikidata="Q335779" url="?curid=311332" title="George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan">
<text>George Charles Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan, (16 April 1800 – 10 November 1888), styled Lord Bingham before 1839, was an Anglo-Irish peer and military officer. He was one of three men, along with Louis Nolan and Lord Raglan, responsible for the fateful order during the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854 that led to the Light Brigade commander, the Earl of Cardigan, leading the Charge of the Light Brigade. He was subsequently promoted to field marshal. He was a ruthless landlord during the Great Famine in Ireland, evicting thousands of his tenants and renting his land to wealthy ranchers. He also came up with a solution that allowed Jews to sit in Parliament.

==Life and military career==

Born the first son of Richard Bingham, 2nd Earl of Lucan, an Anglo-Irish peer, and Elizabeth Bingham (née Belasyse), Lord Bingham (as he was styled up until late June 1839) attended Westminster School but left formal education to be commissioned as an ensign in the 6th Regiment of Foot on 29 August 1816. He transferred to the 11th Light Dragoons on 24 December 1818.

Lord Bingham became a lieutenant in the 8th Regiment of Foot on 20 January 1820, a captain in the 74th Regiment of Foot on 16 May 1822 and was promoted to major, unattached, on 23 June 1825. He transferred to the 17th Lancers on 1 December 1825 and became commanding officer of the regiment with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 9 November 1826; he lavished such expense on his officers&#x27; uniforms and horses that the officers became known as &quot;Bingham&#x27;s Dandies&quot;. He was also elected as MP for County Mayo in 1826 and held that seat until 1830. During the Russo-Turkish War, which began in 1828, he acted observer with the Imperial Russian Army.

===&#x27;The Exterminator&#x27;===

Lord Bingham succeeded his father as 3rd Earl of Lucan in the Peerage of Ireland on 30 June 1839 and, having become an Irish Representative Peer in June 1840 and having been promoted to colonel on 23 November 1841, he became Lord Lieutenant of Mayo in 1845. During the Great Famine in the late 1840s, he was ruthless and introduced mass evictions from villages such as Ballinrobe. Famously stating that he &quot;would not breed paupers to pay priests,&quot; he demolished over 300 homes and evicted 2,000 people in Ballinrobe between 1846 and 1849. He even insisted on closing the workhouse in Castlebar at the height of the Famine. For this, Lord Bingham earned the hatred of many Irishmen and became known as &quot;The Exterminator&quot;. He was promoted to major general on 11 November 1851.

===Crimean War===

At the outbreak of the Crimean War, Lord Lucan applied for a post and was made commander of the Cavalry Division. His brother-in-law, the 7th Earl of Cardigan, was one of his subordinates, commanding the Light Brigade – an unfortunate choice as the two men heartily detested each other. Promoted to brevet lieutenant general on 18 August 1854, he was present at the Battle of Alma in September 1854 but, on the orders of the army commander, Lord Raglan, he held his division in reserve. This incident earned Lucan the undeserved, but persistent, nickname of &quot;Lord Look-on&quot;. 

At the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854, Lucan received an order from Raglan that the cavalry were to advance. Raglan&#x27;s order stated that infantry would be in support, but none had arrived so Lucan did not comply. It was not until Raglan saw that Russian troops were about to capture some artillery pieces did he issue a further order, now requiring an &quot;immediate&quot; cavalry advance. At this point Lucan ordered Cardigan to lead the Light Brigade forward, and the Charge of the Light Brigade commenced. Lucan in turn led the Heavy Brigade forward in support, at a more restrained pace. Both brigades came under heavy fire, and Lucan was slightly wounded. While the Light Brigade continued the charge as far as the enemy guns, receiving very heavy casualties and with no significant gain, Lucan ordered the Heavy Brigade to retire. Raglan blamed Lucan for the loss (&quot;You have lost the light brigade&quot;), and censured him in despatches. Although Lucan complained against this censure, as the relationship between the army commander and the cavalry commander had clearly broken down, he was recalled to England, where he returned at the beginning of March 1855.

On his arrival, Lucan&#x27;s demand for a court-martial was declined and instead he defended himself with a speech to the House of Lords on 19 March 1855, blaming Raglan and his deceased aide-de-camp, Captain Louis Nolan. This tactic appears to have been successful as he was subsequently appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1855, and colonel of the 8th Light Dragoons, who had charged with the Light Brigade, on 17 November 1855.

==Later life==
A significant contribution was made by Lucan to Parliament when he produced a solution to the problem of admitting Jews to Parliament. Prior to this, distinguished Jews had declined to take the oath &quot;on the true faith of a Christian&quot; and having not been sworn in as required by statute, were refused voting rights although having been elected an MP. Lucan proposed, by way of a compromise, that each House could decide and modify its own oath. The House of Lords, who had long opposed the admission of Jews, agreed to this. A prominent Jew, Lionel Nathan Rothschild, was thus allowed to enter the House of Commons and was sworn in on 26 July 1858.

Although Lucan never again saw active duty, he was promoted to lieutenant general on 24 December 1858, and, having become colonel of the 1st Regiment of Life Guards on 27 February 1865, he was to promoted to general on 28 August 1865 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1869. He formally retired in October 1877, but after some lobbying he was promoted to field marshal on 21 June 1887. He died at 13 South Street, Park Lane, London, on 10 November 1888 and was buried at Laleham in Middlesex.

==Family==
In 1829, Bingham married Lady Anne Brudenell, seventh daughter of Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan; they had six children, two daughters being still born or dying soon after birth:

*Charles, 4th Earl of Lucan. He was married to Cecilia Catherine Gordon-Lennox the daughter of Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond. They had issue.
*Augusta (7 February 1832 – 3 July 1888), married her cousin Henry Sturt, 1st Baron Alington on 10 September 1853, and had issue.
*Lavinia (circa 1836 – 15 September 1864), married Charles Hardinge, 2nd Viscount Hardinge MP for Downpatrick on 10 April 1856, and had issue.
*Rear-Admiral Richard (6 January 1847 – 12 November 1924), married Mary Elizabeth Cole the paternal great-granddaughter of Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby and maternal granddaughter of Henry Brooke Parnell, 1st Baron Congleton.

<doc id="311333" wikidata="Q16331" url="?curid=311333" title="Ethmoid bone">
<text>The ethmoid bone (; from ) is an unpaired bone in the skull that separates the nasal cavity from the brain. It is located at the roof of the nose, between the two orbits. The cubical bone is lightweight due to a spongy construction. The ethmoid bone is one of the bones that make up the orbit of the eye.

==Structure==
The ethmoid bone is an anterior cranial bone located between the eyes. It contributes to the medial wall of the orbit, the nasal cavity, and the nasal septum. The ethmoid has three parts: cribriform plate, ethmoidal labyrinth, and perpendicular plate. The cribriform plate forms the roof of the nasal cavity and also contributes to formation of the anterior cranial fossa, the ethmoidal labyrinth consists of a large mass on either side of the perpendicular plate, and the perpendicular plate forms the superior two-thirds of the nasal septum. Between the orbital plate and the nasal conchae are the ethmoidal sinuses or ethmoidal air cells, which are a variable number of small cavities in the lateral mass of the ethmoid.

=== Articulations ===
The ethmoid articulates with thirteen bones:

* two bones of the neurocranium—the frontal, and the sphenoid (at the sphenoidal body and at the sphenoidal conchae).
* eleven bones of the viscerocranium—, two nasal bones, two maxillae, two lacrimals, two palatines, two inferior nasal conchae, and the vomer.

===Development===
The ethmoid is ossified in the cartilage of the nasal capsule by three centers: one for the perpendicular plate, and one for each labyrinth.

The labyrinths are first developed, ossific granules making their appearance in the region of the lamina papyracea between the fourth and fifth months of fetal life, and extending into the conchæ.

At birth, the bone consists of the two labyrinths, which are small and ill-developed. During the first year after birth, the perpendicular plate and crista galli begin to ossify from a single center, and are joined to the labyrinths about the beginning of the second year.

The cribriform plate is ossified partly from the perpendicular plate and partly from the labyrinths.

The development of the ethmoidal cells begins during fetal life.

==Function==
===Role in magnetoception===

Some birds and other migratory animals have deposits of biological magnetite in their ethmoid bones which allow them to sense the direction of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Humans have a similar magnetite deposit (ferric iron), but it is believed to be vestigial.

==Clinical significance==

Fracture of the lamina papyracea, the lateral plate of the ethmoid labyrinth bone, permits communication between the nasal cavity and the orbit on the same side of the body through the inferomedial orbital wall, resulting in orbital emphysema. Increased pressure within the nasal cavity, as seen during sneezing, for example, leads to temporary exophthalmos.

The porous fragile nature of the ethmoid bone makes it particularly susceptible to fractures. The ethmoid is usually fractured from an upward force to the nose. This could occur by hitting the dashboard in a car crash or landing on the ground after a fall. The ethmoid fracture can produce bone fragments that penetrate the cribriform plate. This trauma can lead to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid into the nasal cavity. These openings let opportunistic bacteria in the nasal cavity enter the sterile environment of the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is usually protected by the blood–brain barrier, but holes in the cribriform plate let bacteria get through the barrier. The blood–brain barrier makes it extremely difficult to treat such infections, because only certain drugs can cross into the CNS.

An ethmoid fracture can also sever the olfactory nerve. This injury results in anosmia (loss of smell). A reduction in the ability to taste is also a side effect because it is based so heavily on smell. This injury is not fatal, but can be dangerous, as when a person fails to smell smoke, gas, or spoiled food. In fact, people with anosmia were more than four times as likely to die in five years compared to those with a healthy sense of smell.

<text>The Nure (Latin &quot;Nura&quot;) is a small river in northern Italy (province of Piacenza). It has its source on the northern slopes of Mt. Nero, elevation above sea level, and after a course of about —the second longest of the province—flows into the Po River east of Piacenza, in the vicinity of Roncarolo, a &quot;frazione&quot; of the commune of Caorso, on the border with the Lombard commune of Caselle Landi. 

The upper valley is somewhat influenced by the sea air, keeping it free of fog and strong winds, and therefore relatively pleasant even during the winter months.

In this valley, there are 79 fortifications (castles, fortified towers and dwellings, etc.)

The main villages along this river are: Ferriere, Bosconure, Cantoniera, Farini d&#x27;Olmo, Bettola, Ponte dell&#x27;Olio, Vigolzone, Grazzano Visconti, Podenzano.

In addition to the main villages, other areas of the Val Nure (Valley of the Nure) are delineated by parishes, with churches located along the peaks of the mountains. One example is Cogno San Bassano, at the top of the mountain above Farini d&#x27;Olmo.

In 1799 the French Auvergne Regiment was surrendered at this river during the Revolutionary Wars. This marked the end of the Battle of the Trebbia, in which Suvorov&#x27;s Russian and Austrian troops won a complete victory.

<text>Ecclesia Gnostica (Latin: The Church of Gnosis) is an open sacramental neo-Gnostic church based in the United States. It has ordained clergy and conducts regular sacramental services, including two weekly Masses (Celebration of the Holy Eucharist), as well as monthly and seasonal services in accordance with the liturgical calendar. It has active parishes in Seattle, Portland, Austin, and Los Angeles.

==History==

The organisation now called the Ecclesia Gnostica was originally organised in England under the name &quot;the Pre-Nicene Gnostic Catholic Church&quot; in 1953, by the Most Rev. Richard Jean Chretien Duc de Palatine with the object of &quot;restoring the Gnosis – Divine Wisdom to the Christian Church, and to teach the Path of Holiness which leads to God and the Inner Illumination and Interior Communion with the Soul through the mortal body of man.&quot; Born Ronald Powell, Richard Duc de Palatine had served in the Liberal Catholic Church in Australia, before moving to England. Bishop Duc de Palatine was consecrated by the Most Rev. Msg. Hugh George de Willmott Newman (Mar Georgius I), patriarch of the Catholic Apostolic Church (Catholicate of the West) who consolidated many lines of apostolic succession.

Bishop Duc de Palatine also received a charter in 1953 to head an organisation first called &quot;the Brotherhood of the Illuminati,&quot; renamed &quot;the Order of the Pleroma&quot; in 1960. He received other esoteric lines and charters such as: the Templar Order, Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, Memphis and Mizraim Rites of Freemasonry, and the Martiniste Order, and termed the combination with the Ecumenical Apostolic Succession &quot;the Wisdom Religion-Gnostic Mystic Tradition.&quot;

In 1959 the organisation became active in the United States through the work of Stephan A. Hoeller, who served as a priest of the church in Los Angeles, and was subsequently consecrated bishop in 1967. He took the role of presiding bishop on the death of de Palatine in 1977. The two men had had a personal falling out prior.

===The Ecumenical Apostolic Succession===

Most Rev. Msg. Hugh George de Willmott Newman (Mar Georgius I) felt that all proper and valid consecrations and ordinations are equally efficacious regardless of the particular line of apostolic succession, but also that some degree of irregularity would attach itself to acts lacking ecumenical sanction. And so, to rectify any irregularity, and to overcome any doubts about validity of any line of apostolic succession, he sought and received conditional consecration from every part of the One Holy Catholic (Universal) and Apostolic church, bringing into being the Ecumenical Apostolic Succession. This Ecumenical line incorporates Syrian-Antiochene, Syrian-Malabar, Syrian-Gallican, Syro-Chaldean, Chaldean-Uniate, Coptic-Orthodox, Armenian-Uniate, Greek-Melkite, Russian-Orthodox, Russo-Syriac, Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, Liberal Catholic, Order of Corporate Reunion, Mariavite; and additional (disputed) lines of Anglican, Nonjuring, Celtic, Welsh, and Restored Apostolic (Irvingite).

All of these lines were passed to bishop Duc de Palatine at his consecration in 1953 and in a subsequent conditional consecration in 1955, then passed on to Hoeller in 1967.

==Organisation==

===Polity===

The leaders of the church are Most Rev. Stephan A. Hoeller, Regionary Bishop, and Rt. Rev. Steven Marshall, Auxiliary Bishop.

===Participation===

The Ecclesia Gnostica has no formal, dues-paying membership, and its activities are open to all, regardless of creed.

===Clergy===

Holy orders are open to all genders and orientations. Clergy are self-sustaining, not receiving a salary from the church.

==Teachings and doctrinal orientation==

Though Christianity based on Gnosis is unaligned with creed or acceptance from mainstream Christian churches, the Ecclesia Gnostica considers itself part of the fellowship of Universal Christendom, that is part of the One Holy Catholic (Universal) and Apostolic Church.

The Ecclesia Gnostica is a liturgical orthopraxy rather than an orthodoxy. Christian liturgy is central to the existence of the church, and in ritual and ornament the church is similar to Catholicism.

The church does not proselytise. There is not an exclusive claim of salvation; salvation is not dependent on participation in the church. Salvation is also understood differently from salvation in mainstream Christianity: salvation is achieved through Gnosis, described as &quot;an inner &#x27;knowingness,&#x27; a change of consciousness.&quot;

Gnosticism is grounded in the experience of Gnosis, which is the salvific and revelatory experience of transcendence. The experience of Gnosis receives expression in the Gnostic Mythology which allows the Gnostic to amplify and assimilate the experience of Gnosis and also makes further experience of Gnosis possible.

The focus is no single version or rendering of the Gnostic Mythos, but the entire heritage of the Gnostic tradition, which includes: primary sources such as the Nag Hammadi Library and much of the canonical Bible, with consideration of the less reliable accounts and recensions of teachings found in heresiological texts, the Hermetic writings, and the teachings of the Prophet Mani.

===Understanding of the Gnostic tradition===

While recognising the very pluralistic and creative elements of ancient Gnostic teachings they are seen as embracing a set of common assumptions which form the core of the Gnostic tradition. The &quot;brief and inadequate outline&quot; of this core given by bishop Hoeller is further summarised below:



The church does not require the acceptance of these teachings as a matter of belief. Although it states, &quot;it is obvious that these teachings represent the distinctive contribution of the Gnostic tradition to religious thought and persons functioning within the tradition would find themselves in general agreement with them.&quot;

==Worship and spiritual practice==

Ecclesia Gnostica services consist of different liturgical celebrations usually based on traditional Western forms of Christian liturgy. Like ancient Gnostic groups, the Ecclesia Gnostica blends several disparate traditions. The church performs its sacraments &quot;in accordance with the tradition of the Ancient Mystery Schools&quot; and attempts to present them &quot;in their original meaning as archetypal acts of ceremonial communion with the timeless realities of the soul.&quot;

===The Gnostic Holy Eucharist===

The celebration of the Gnostic Holy Eucharist is offered every Sunday in Los Angeles (and most other parishes). The Eucharist is central to the practice of the church, and is celebrated with high formality as congregants prepare to commune with &quot;the indwelling and cosmic Christ.&quot; The service resembles a Traditional Roman Catholic liturgy in style, complete with elaborate vestments, burning candles, incense, and bells.

The service contains the Post-Eucharistic Benediction, &quot;The peace of God which passeth all understanding, go with you. There is a power that makes all things new: It lives and moves in those who know the Self as one. May that peace brood over you, that Power uplift you into the Light, may It keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and Love of God, and of His Son, our Lord the Christ.&quot;

===Other sacraments===

The Ecclesia Gnostica recognises five initiatory sacraments as listed in the Gospel of Philip: Baptism, Chrism or Confirmation, Eucharist, Redemption (Consolamentum) and Bride-Chamber, with the additional two sustaining sacraments of Holy Orders and Anointing of the Sick. (The sacraments of Penance and Matrimony are considered to be secondary sacraments having been substituted for those of Redemption and Bride-Chamber.) The initiatory sacraments of Baptism and Chrism or Confirmation and the two sustaining sacraments are offered by the church.
===Devotional service to the Holy Sophia===

In addition to the forms of liturgical service in the tradition of the Christian church, there is also the devotional service to the Holy Sophia that is unique to the rite of the Ecclesia Gnostica.

===Liturgical calendar and lectionary===

The church follows the traditional Western liturgical calendar with additions and emendations. These changes include the addition of observances of Gnostic church fathers and martyrs of the Gnostic tradition, and the re-dedication of the Marian feasts of Assumption and Nativity to the Assumption and Descent of the Holy Sophia (without decrying traditional Marian devotion).

The Lectionary, the book of collects, lessons (instead of epistles), and gospels, of the church was written, edited, and collected by bishop Stephan A. Hoeller and issued in 1974. Scriptures were collected from the Old and New Testament; the Pistis Sophia and other scriptures known before the Nag Hammadi find; the Nag Hammadi Library of the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Truth, and Gospel of Phillip; Cathar, Hermetic, Manichean, and Mandaean sources; and the Chaldean Oracles.

<text>The Gnostic Society was founded in Los Angeles in 1928, and incorporated in 1939, by John Morgan Pryse (1863–1952) and his brother James Morgan Pryse (1859–1942) for studies of Gnosticism. Stephan A. Hoeller, author and lecturer and a leading exponent of Gnosticism, became the director of studies in 1963.

The organization ceased to exist as a legal entity in 1974. Since that time, Hoeller has lectured under the society&#x27;s name, presenting it as an educational organization &quot;dedicated to advancing the study, understanding, and individual experience of Gnosis.&quot;

<text>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is the combined presence of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome (AKS ). Due to the close relationship between these two disorders, people with either are usually diagnosed with WKS as a single syndrome. It mainly causes vision changes, ataxia and impaired memory.
The cause of the disorder is thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This can occur due to Wernicke encephalopathy, eating disorders, malnutrition, and alcohol abuse. These disorders may manifest together or separately. WKS is usually secondary to prolonged alcohol abuse.
Wernicke encephalopathy and WKS are most commonly seen in people with an alcohol use disorder. Failure in diagnosis of WE and thus treatment of the disease leads to death in approximately 20% of cases, while 75% are left with permanent brain damage associated with WKS. Of those affected, 25% require long-term institutionalization in order to receive effective care.

==Signs and symptoms==
The syndrome is a combined manifestation of two namesake disorders, Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. It involves an acute Wernicke-encephalopathy phase, followed by the development of a Korsakoff syndrome phase.

===Wernicke encephalopathy===
WE is characterized by the presence of a triad of symptoms:

# Ocular disturbances (ophthalmoplegia)
# Changes in mental state (confusion)
# Unsteady stance and gait (ataxia)

This triad of symptoms results from a deficiency in vitamin B1 which is an essential coenzyme. The aforementioned changes in mental state occur in approximately 82% of patients&#x27; symptoms which range from confusion, apathy, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in awareness of the immediate situation they are in. If left untreated, WE can lead to coma or death. In about 29% of patients, ocular disturbances consist of nystagmus and paralysis of the lateral rectus muscles or other muscles in the eye. A smaller percentage of patients experience a decrease in reaction time of the pupils to light stimuli and swelling of the optic disc which may be accompanied by retinal hemorrhage. Finally, the symptoms involving stance and gait occur in about 23% of patients and result from dysfunction in the cerebellum and vestibular system. Other symptoms that have been present in cases of WE are stupor, low blood pressure (hypotension), elevated heart rate (tachycardia), as well as hypothermia, epileptic seizures and a progressive loss of hearing.

About 19% of patients have none of the symptoms in the classic triad at first diagnosis of WE; however, usually one or more of the symptoms develops later as the disease progresses.

===Korsakoff syndrome===
The DSM-5 classifies Korsakoff syndrome under Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorders, specifically alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory. The diagnostic criteria defined as necessary for diagnosis includes prominent amnesia, forgetting quickly, and difficulty learning. Presence of thiamine deficient encephalopathy can occur in conjunction with these symptoms.

Despite the assertion that alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome must be caused by the use of alcohol, there have been several cases where it has developed from other instances of thiamine deficiency resulting from gross malnutrition due to conditions such as stomach cancer, anorexia nervosa, and gastrectomy.

===Cognitive effects===
Several cases have been documented where Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome has been seen on a large scale. In 1947, 52 cases of WKS were documented in a prisoner of war hospital in Singapore where the prisoners&#x27; diets included less than 1 mg of thiamine per day. Such cases provide an opportunity to gain an understanding of what effects this syndrome has on cognition. In this particular case, cognitive symptoms included insomnia, anxiety, difficulties in concentration, loss of memory for the immediate past, and gradual degeneration of mental state; consisting of confusion, confabulation, and hallucinations. In other cases of WKS, cognitive effects such as severely disrupted speech, giddiness, and heavy-headedness have been documented. In addition to this, it has been noted that some patients displayed an inability to focus, and the inability of others to catch patients&#x27; attention.

In a study conducted in 2003 by Brand et al. on the cognitive effects of WKS, the researchers used a neuropsychological test battery which included tests of intelligence, speed of information processing, memory, executive function and cognitive estimation. They found that subjects with WKS showed impairments in all aspects of this test battery but most noticeably, on the cognitive estimation tasks. This task required subjects to estimate a physical quality such as size, weight, quantity or time (e.g. What is the average length of a shower?) of a particular item. Patients with WKS performed worse than normal control participants on all of the tasks in this category. The patients found estimations involving time to be the most difficult, whereas quantity was the easiest estimation to make. Additionally, the study included a category for classifying &quot;bizarre&quot; answers, which included any answer that was far outside of the normal range of expected responses. WKS patients did give answers that could fall into such a category, such as 15 seconds or 1 hour for the estimated length of a shower, or 4 kg or 15 tonnes as the weight of a car.

===Memory deficits===
The amnesic symptoms of WKS include both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. The retrograde deficit has been demonstrated through an inability of WKS patients to recall or recognize information for recent public events. The anterograde memory loss is demonstrated through deficits in tasks that involve encoding and then recalling lists of words and faces, as well as semantic learning tasks. WKS patients have also demonstrated difficulties in perseveration as evidenced by a deficit in performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The retrograde amnesia that accompanies WKS can extend as far back as twenty to thirty years, and there is generally a temporal gradient seen, where earlier memories are recalled better than more recent memories. It has been widely accepted that the critical structures that lead to the memory impairment in WKS are the mammillary bodies, and the thalamic regions. Despite the aforementioned memory deficits, non-declarative memory functions appear to be intact in WKS patients. This has been demonstrated through measures that assess perceptual priming.

Other studies have shown deficits in recognition memory and stimulus-reward associative functions in patients with WKS. The deficit in stimulus-reward functions was demonstrated by Oscar-Berman and Pulaski who presented patients with reinforcements for certain stimuli but not others, and then required the patients to distinguish the rewarded stimuli from the non-rewarded stimuli. WKS patients displayed significant deficits in this task. The researchers were also successful in displaying a deficit in recognition memory by having patients make a yes/no decision as to whether a stimulus was familiar (previously seen) or novel (not previously seen). The patients in this study also showed a significant deficit in their ability to perform this task.

===Confabulation===
People with WKS often show confabulation, spontaneous confabulation being seen more frequently than provoked confabulation. Spontaneous confabulations refer to incorrect memories that the patient holds to be true, and may act on, arising spontaneously without any provocation. Provoked confabulations can occur when a patient is cued to give a response, this may occur in test settings. The spontaneous confabulations viewed in WKS are thought to be produced by an impairment in source memory, where they are unable to remember the spatial and contextual information for an event, and thus may use irrelevant or old memory traces to fill in for the information that they cannot access. It has also been suggested that this behaviour may be due to executive dysfunction where they are unable to inhibit incorrect memories or because they are unable to shift their attention away from an incorrect response.

==Causes==
It is generally agreed that Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome results from severe acute deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1) whilst Korsakoff&#x27;s psychosis is a chronic neurologic of Wernicke encephalopathy and is usually found in people who have used alcohol chronically. The metabolically active form of thiamine is thiamine pyrophosphate, which plays a major role as a cofactor or coenzyme in glucose metabolism. The enzymes that are dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate are associated with the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and catalyze the oxidation of pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate and branched chain amino acids. Thus, anything that encourages glucose metabolism will exacerbate an existing clinical or sub-clinical thiamine deficiency.

As stated above, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in the United States is usually found in malnourished chronic alcoholics, though it is also found in patients who undergo prolonged intravenous (IV) therapy without vitamin B1 supplementation, gastric stapling, intensive care unit (ICU) stays, hunger strikes, or people with eating disorders. In some regions, physicians have observed thiamine deficiency brought about by severe malnutrition, particularly in diets consisting mainly of polished rice, which is thiamine-deficient. The resulting nervous system ailment is called beriberi. In individuals with sub-clinical thiamine deficiency, a large dose of glucose (either as sweet food or glucose infusion) can precipitate the onset of overt encephalopathy.

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in people with chronic alcohol use particularly is associated with atrophy/infarction of specific regions of the brain, especially the mammillary bodies. Other regions include the anterior region of the thalamus (accounting for amnesic symptoms), the medial dorsal thalamus, the basal forebrain, the median and dorsal raphe nuclei, and the cerebellum.

One as-yet-unreplicated study has associated susceptibility to this syndrome with a hereditary deficiency of transketolase, an enzyme that requires thiamine as a coenzyme.

===Post-gastrectomy===
The fact that gastrointestinal surgery can lead to the development of WKS was demonstrated in a study that was completed on three patients who recently undergone a gastrectomy. These patients had developed WKS but were not alcoholics and had never suffered from dietary deprivation. WKS developed between 2 and 20 years after the surgery. There were small dietary changes that contributed to the development of WKS but overall the lack of absorption of thiamine from the gastrointestinal tract was the cause. Therefore, it must be ensured that patients who have undergone gastrectomy have a proper education on dietary habits, and carefully monitor their thiamine intake. Additionally, an early diagnosis of WKS, should it develop, is very important.

===Alcohol-thiamine interactions===
Strong evidence suggests that ethanol interferes directly with thiamine uptake in the gastrointestinal tract. Ethanol also disrupts thiamine storage in the liver and the transformation of thiamine into its active form. The role of alcohol consumption in the development of WKS has been experimentally confirmed through studies in which rats were subjected to alcohol exposure and lower levels of thiamine through a low-thiamine diet. In particular, studies have demonstrated that clinical signs of the neurological problems that result from thiamine deficiency develop faster in rats that have received alcohol and were also deficient in thiamine than rats who did not receive alcohol. In another study, it was found that rats that were chronically fed alcohol had significantly lower liver thiamine stores than control rats. This provides an explanation for why alcoholics with liver cirrhosis have a higher incidence of both thiamine deficiency and WKS.

==Pathophysiology==
The vitamin thiamine, also referred to as vitamin B1, is required by three different enzymes to allow for conversion of ingested nutrients into energy. Thiamine can not be produced in the body and must be obtained through diet and supplementation. The duodenum is responsible for absorbing thiamine. The liver can store thiamine for 18 days. Prolonged and frequent consumption of alcohol causes a decreased ability to absorb thiamine in the duodenum. Thiamine deficiency is also related to malnutrition from poor diet, impaired use of thiamine by the cells and impaired storage in the liver. Without thiamine the Krebs cycle enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH) are impaired. The impaired functioning of the Krebs cycle results in inadequate production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or energy for the cells functioning. Energy is required by the brain for proper functioning and use of its neurotransmitters. Injury to the brain occurs when neurons that require high amounts of energy from thiamine dependent enzymes are not supplied with enough energy and die.

Brain atrophy associated with WKS occurs in the following regions of the brain:

# the mammillary bodies,
# the thalamus,
# the periaqueductal grey,
# the walls of the 3rd ventricle,
# the floor of the 4th ventricle,
# the cerebellum, and
# the frontal lobe.

In addition to the damage seen in these areas there have been reports of damage to cortex, although it was noted that this may be due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol as opposed to thiamine deficiency that has been attributed as the underlying cause of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.

The amnesia that is associated with this syndrome is a result of the atrophy in the structures of the diencephalon (the thalamus, hypothalamus and mammillary bodies), and is similar to amnesia that is presented as a result of other cases of damage to the medial temporal lobe. It has been argued that the memory impairments can occur as a result of damage along any part of the mammillo-thalamic tract, which explains how WKS can develop in patients with damage exclusively to either the thalamus or the mammillary bodies.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is by clinical impression and can sometimes be confirmed by a formal neuropsychological assessment. Wernicke encephalopathy typically presents with ataxia and nystagmus, and Korsakoff&#x27;s psychosis with anterograde and retrograde amnesia and confabulation upon relevant lines of questioning.

Frequently, secondary to thiamine deficiency and subsequent cytotoxic edema in Wernicke encephalopathy, patients will have marked degeneration of the mammillary bodies. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism and is also a regulator of osmotic gradient. Its deficiency may cause swelling of the intracellular space and local disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Brain tissue is very sensitive to changes in electrolytes and pressure and edema can be cytotoxic. In Wernicke this occurs specifically in the mammillary bodies, medial thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal areas. People with the condition may also exhibit a dislike for sunlight and so may wish to stay indoors with the lights off. The mechanism of this degeneration is unknown, but it supports the current neurological theory that the mammillary bodies play a role in various &quot;memory circuits&quot; within the brain. An example of a memory circuit is the Papez circuit.

==Prevention==
As described, Korsakoff syndrome usually follows or accompanies Wernicke encephalopathy. If treated quickly, it may be possible to prevent the development of WKS with thiamine treatments. This treatment is not guaranteed to be effective and the thiamine needs to be administered adequately in both dose and duration. A study on Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome showed that with consistent thiamine treatment there were noticeable improvements in mental status after only 2–3 weeks of therapy. Thus, there is hope that with treatment Wernicke encephalopathy will not necessarily progress to WKS. 

In order to reduce the risk of developing WKS it is important to limit the intake of alcohol in order to ensure that proper nutrition needs are met. A healthy diet is imperative for proper nutrition which, in combination with thiamine supplements, may reduce the chance of developing WKS. This prevention method may specifically help heavy drinkers who refuse to or are unable to quit.

A number of proposals have been put forth to fortify alcoholic beverages with thiamine to reduce the incidence of WKS among those heavily abusing alcohol. To date, no such proposals have been enacted.

Daily recommendations of thiamine requirements are 0.66 mg per of food energy intake—approximately equivalent to 1.2 mg for men and 1.1 mg for women.

==Treatment==

The onset of Wernicke encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency. Prompt administration of thiamine can prevent the disorder from developing into Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, or reduce its severity. Treatment can also reduce the progression of the deficits caused by WKS, but will not completely reverse existing deficits. WKS will continue to be present, at least partially, in 80% of patients. Banana bags, a bag of intravenous fluids containing vitamins and minerals, may be used as a treatment.

==Epidemiology==
WKS occurs more frequently in men than women and has the highest prevalence in the ages 55–65. Approximately 71% are unmarried.

Internationally, the prevalence rates of WKS are relatively standard, being anywhere between zero and two percent. Despite this, specific sub-populations seem to have higher prevalence rates including people who are homeless, older individuals (especially those living alone or in isolation), and psychiatric inpatients. Additionally, studies show that prevalence is not connected to alcohol consumption per capita. For example, in France, a country that is well known for its consumption and production of wine, prevalence was only 0.4% in 1994, while Australia had a prevalence of 2.8%.

==History==

===Wernicke encephalopathy===
Carl Wernicke discovered Wernicke encephalopathy in 1881. His first diagnosis noted symptoms including paralyzed eye movements, ataxia, and mental confusion. Also noticed were hemorrhages in the gray matter around the third and fourth ventricles and the cerebral aqueduct. Brain atrophy was only found upon post-mortem autopsy. Wernicke believed these hemorrhages were due to inflammation and thus the disease was named polioencephalitis haemorrhagica superior. Later, it was found that Wernicke encephalopathy and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome are products of the same cause.

===Korsakoff syndrome===
Sergei Korsakoff was a Russian physician after whom the disease &quot;Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome&quot; was named. In the late 1800s Korsakoff was studying long-term alcoholic patients and began to notice a decline in their memory function. At the 13th International Medical Congress in Moscow in 1897, Korsakoff presented a report called: &quot;On a special form of mental illness combined with degenerative polyneuritis&quot;. After the presentation of this report the term &quot;Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome&quot; was coined.

Although WE and AKS were discovered separately, these two syndromes are usually referred to under one name, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, due to the fact that they are part of the same cause and because the onset of AKS usually follows WE if left untreated.

==Society and culture==
The British neurologist Oliver Sacks describes case histories of some of his patients with the syndrome in the book &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot; (1985). 
Frontman and lead vocalist of the hard rock band Breaking Benjamin, Benjamin Burnley, is well known to be living with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome due to his past alcoholism. He has written multiple songs about addiction and his experiences with alcohol, with many of such songs being found on the band&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Dear Agony&quot; as it was the first album Burnley had written and recorded completely sober.

<text>Noah Strausser Speer Wyle (; born June 4, 1971) is an American actor, producer, director, and writer. Since 2025 he has starred as Dr. Michael &quot;Robby&quot; Robinavitch in the Max medical drama &quot;The Pitt&quot;. Since 2021 he has starred as lawyer Harry Wilson in &quot;&quot;, a revival of &quot;Leverage&quot; (2008–2012). He is best known for his role as John Carter in the television series &quot;ER&quot; (1994–2009), which earned him nominations for three Golden Globe Awards and five Primetime Emmy Awards. He is also known for his roles as Flynn Carsen in &quot;The Librarian&quot; franchise and Tom Mason in the television series &quot;Falling Skies&quot; (2011–2015). He has appeared in films such as &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; (1999), &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001), and &quot;W.&quot; (2008).

Wyle was nominated for a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for his role as Daniel Calder in the television miniseries &quot;The Red Line&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Wyle, the middle of three children, was born in Los Angeles, the son of Marjorie (née Speer), a registered orthopedic head nurse, and Stephen Wyle, an electrical engineer and entrepreneur. His father was Jewish (of Russian-Jewish descent), whereas his mother was Episcopalian, and he was raised &quot;fairly nondenominationally&quot;, around both faiths. Wyle&#x27;s parents divorced in the late 1970s, and his mother later married James C. Katz, a film restorationist with three children of his own from a previous marriage. Wyle&#x27;s paternal grandparents, Edith and Frank Wyle, founded the Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art Museum, and his grandfather also founded Wyle Laboratories. Edith R. Wyle was an expressionist painter who also created &quot;The Egg and The Eye&quot;, a café and shop in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles.

Wyle was educated at The Thacher School in Ojai, California, and graduated with the class of 1989. Wyle participated in a Theatre Arts program at Northwestern University after his junior year of high school and appeared in high school plays, even winning an award for a play he wrote. Although he attended Northwestern University for a program in high school, he did not attend nor graduate from college. He studied with acting teacher Larry Moss while living in a small apartment on Hollywood Boulevard.

==Career==
===&quot;ER&quot;===
Wyle&#x27;s big break came when he was given the pilot script for &quot;ER&quot; and was cast as medical student John Carter. He was the youngest member when he joined the cast. Wyle was the only major cast member of &quot;ER&quot; to have been with the show since its inception (1994) when he left after its eleventh season (2005). His performances on the show earned him Emmy Award nominations in each of its first five seasons. As part of an ensemble he was nominated several times for the Screen Actors Guild Award, he was recognized with three Golden Globe nominations as Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television, and he won the 2001 TV Guide Award for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.

Wyle left the series at the end of season 11, although he returned in guest appearances for a four-episode arc during season 12. He stated that he left because he wanted to spend more time with his family and friends and to make room for the upcoming generation. In 2009 Wyle returned to &quot;ER&quot; during its fifteenth and final season for five episodes, including the series finale.

According to the Guinness World Records 2005 Special 50th Anniversary Edition, Wyle became the holder of a &quot;highest paid TV drama actor per episode&quot; record during the 2003–2004 tenth season, earning approximately $400,000 per episode. While on &quot;ER&quot;, Wyle&#x27;s estimated salary was $9 million a year. Wyle has also appeared in the most episodes of &quot;ER&quot;, 254, five more than Laura Innes.

===&quot;The Librarian&quot;===
Wyle starred in the film &quot;The Librarian: Quest for the Spear&quot; (2004), launching what would become &quot;The Librarian&quot; franchise. Two sequels, &quot;The Librarian: Return to King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and &quot;The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice&quot;, were followed by a television series called &quot;The Librarians&quot; (2014-2018) which focuses on three additional new librarians who are brought into the library at a time of cataclysmic events.

===Film===

Wyle was first seen in the Paul Bartel 1985 film &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; (a western exploitation/parody which starred Tab Hunter, Lainie Kazan, and Divine) as an extra in the local gang running the small town of Chili Verde.

His later roles were a mini-series and featuring in the movie &quot;Crooked Hearts&quot; (1991) in 1990. In 1993 he appeared in another feature film, &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;. After appearing in several local plays in Los Angeles, he was cast in the box-office hit &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, in which he played a Marine jeep driver who testified in court. He also appeared in the feature &quot;Swing Kids&quot; as Emil Lutz, a leader in the Hitler Youth, and in the independent movie &quot;The Myth of Fingerprints&quot; with Roy Scheider, Blythe Danner, and Julianne Moore. Additionally, he starred as Lancelot opposite Sheryl Lee in the Television movie &quot;Guinevere&quot;.

His other work has included a critically acclaimed turn as Steve Jobs in the Emmy-nominated &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; (1999). Steve Jobs was so impressed with the performance that he invited Wyle to step on stage as him at the opening of his annual speech at the Apple convention. He has also appeared in several feature films, including &quot;White Oleander&quot; opposite Renée Zellweger, &quot;Enough&quot; opposite Jennifer Lopez, the independent feature &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, as the President&#x27;s interpreter in the 2000 live-television production of &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, and in the independent film &quot;The Californians&quot;.

Wyle starred as the lead in TNT&#x27;s sci-fi series &quot;Falling Skies&quot; (2011-2015), Wyle played Tom Mason, a former Boston University history professor who becomes the second-in-command of the 2nd Massachusetts Militia Regiment, a group of civilians and fighters fleeing post-apocalyptic Boston while fighting aliens who have wiped out 90% of humanity. The character was also the father of three boys, one of whom was captured by the aliens. Wyle&#x27;s performance earned him BuddyTV&#x27;s #91 position on its list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Sexiest Men of 2011&quot;.

In 2019, he played Daniel Calder in the eight-part limited series &quot;The Red Line&quot;.

===Stage===

Along with his film and television career, Wyle is also Artistic Producer of The Blank Theatre Company located in Hollywood, California. With the company, he has appeared on stage in the 1995 production of &quot;The 24th Day&quot; with Peter Berg, &quot;The Why&quot; (as part of the company&#x27;s Young Playwrights Festival), and &quot;Lobster Alice&quot;, opposite Nicholas Brendon, where he played the surrealist painter Salvador Dalí.

For his work as one of the producers of 2005 Los Angeles Production of Michael John LaChiusa&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Party&quot;, he won an NAACP Theatre Award.

==Personal life==
Noah met his first wife, make-up artist Tracy Warbin, on the set of &quot;The Myth of Fingerprints&quot;. They married in 2000 and have a son, Owen Strausser Speer Wyle (born November 9, 2002), and a daughter, Auden Wyle (born October 15, 2005). Wyle and Warbin separated in 2009 and divorced in 2010.

Wyle married Sara Wells in June 2014 in California. The couple met in 2011 during a production at The Blank Theatre Company. Their daughter Frances Harper Wyle was born on June 22, 2015.

==Political advocacy and philanthropy==
Wyle opened the 1999 NY Macworld Expo keynote, initially posing as Apple Inc.&#x27;s Steve Jobs. It was a practical joke on the audience, engineered by Jobs and Wyle in light of the 1999 TNT film &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;.

Wyle devotes much of his free time to the international non-profit organization Doctors of the World and to his work as a member of the Human Rights Watch Council. Wyle also serves as the voluntary artistic producer of the Blank Theatre Company in Hollywood, which stages an annual young playwrights festival and whose alumni include Ed Asner, Sarah Michelle Gellar, D. B. Sweeney, James Kerwin, Amber Benson, Megan Henning, Travis Schuldt, Warren Davis, Grant Show, and Nicholas Brendon. He also recently acquired Second Stage Theater (Los Angeles) in Hollywood, where the company has mounted numerous successful productions.

Wyle was the spokesperson for the Cover the Uninsured campaign in 2004, which had as Honorary Co-Chairs former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. The Cover the Uninsured Week is annually held in the United States of America and focuses attention on the nearly 44 million Americans who go without health care coverage. The campaign includes several events among different communities, health and enrollment fairs, press conferences, and business seminars all over the U.S. Additionally, Wyle is a supporter of animal rights and a spokesman for the World Wildlife Fund, dedicated to protecting and conserving wildlife for future generations.

In 2009, Wyle became a spokesperson for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), saying that polar bears are &quot;hanging on by a thread&quot; and &quot;may be extinct in our children&#x27;s lifetime, due to the effects of climate change.&quot;

In 2012, Wyle supported the disability rights group ADAPT. On April 23, he was arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill to fight against Medicaid cuts for the elderly and people with disabilities.

Just after Donald Trump won the 2016 general election, Wyle along with other actors participated in a video released by Unite for America, making a heartfelt appeal to the Republican presidential electors of the Electoral College to swing their votes away from President-elect Donald Trump so the House of Representatives could select what Wyle and others referred to as a qualified candidate for the presidency. This was all to prevent Trump from officially becoming President of the United States. The video was presented on national television and YouTube.

<text>Evan Hunter (born Salvatore Albert Lombino; October 15, 1926 – July 6, 2005) was an American author of crime and mystery fiction. He is best known as the author of &quot;87th Precinct&quot; novels, published under the pen name Ed McBain, which are considered staples of police procedural genre.

His other notable works include &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel about life in a troubled inner-city school, which was adapted into a hit 1955 film of the same name. He also wrote the screenplay for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 film &quot;The Birds&quot;, based on the Daphne du Maurier short story.

Hunter, who legally adopted that name in 1952, also used the pen names John Abbott, Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins, Ezra Hannon and Richard Marsten, among others.

==Life==

===Early life===
Salvatore Lombino was born and raised in New York City. He lived in East Harlem until age 12, when his family moved to the Bronx. He attended Olinville Junior High School (later Richard R. Green Middle School #113), then Evander Childs High School (now Evander Childs Educational Campus), before winning a New York Art Students League scholarship. Later, he was admitted as an art student at Cooper Union. Lombino served in the United States Navy during World War II and wrote several short stories while serving aboard a destroyer in the Pacific. However, none of these stories was published until after he had established himself as an author in the 1950s.

After the war, Lombino returned to New York and attended Hunter College, where he majored in English and psychology, with minors in dramatics and education, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1950. He published a weekly column in the Hunter College newspaper as &quot;S.A. Lombino&quot;. In 1981, Lombino was inducted into the Hunter College Hall of Fame, where he was honored for outstanding professional achievement.

While looking to start a career as a writer, Lombino took a variety of jobs, including 17 days as a teacher at Bronx Vocational High School in September 1950. This experience would later form the basis for his novel &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1954), written under the pen name Evan Hunter, which was adapted into the film &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955).

In 1951, Lombino took a job as an executive editor for the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, working with authors such as Poul Anderson, Arthur C. Clarke, Lester del Rey, Richard S. Prather, and P.G. Wodehouse. He made his first professional short story sale the same year, a science-fiction tale titled &quot;Welcome, Martians!&quot;, credited to S. A. Lombino.

===Name change and pen names===
Soon after his initial sale, Lombino sold stories under the pen names Evan Hunter and Hunt Collins. The name &quot;Evan Hunter&quot; is generally believed to have been derived from two schools he attended, Evander Childs High School and Hunter College, although the author himself would never confirm that. (He did confirm that Hunt Collins was derived from Hunter College.) Lombino legally changed his name to Evan Hunter in May 1952, after an editor told him that a novel he wrote would sell more copies if credited to Evan Hunter than to S. A. Lombino. Thereafter, he used the name Evan Hunter both personally and professionally.

As Evan Hunter, he gained notice with his novel &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1954) dealing with juvenile crime and the New York City public school system. The film adaptation followed in 1955.

During this era, Hunter also wrote a great deal of genre fiction. He was advised by his agents that publishing too much fiction under the Hunter byline, or publishing &quot;any&quot; crime fiction as Evan Hunter, might weaken his literary reputation. Consequently, during the 1950s Hunter used the pseudonyms Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins, and Richard Marsten for much of his crime fiction. A prolific author in several genres, Hunter also published approximately two dozen science fiction stories and four science-fiction novels between 1951 and 1956 under the names S. A. Lombino, Evan Hunter, Richard Marsten, D. A. Addams, and Ted Taine.

Ed McBain, his best known pseudonym, was first used with &quot;Cop Hater&quot; (1956), the first novel in the 87th Precinct crime series. Hunter revealed that he was McBain in 1958 but continued to use the pseudonym for decades, notably for the 87th Precinct series and the Matthew Hope detective series. He retired the pen names Addams, Cannon, Collins, Marsten, and Taine around 1960. From then on crime novels were generally attributed to McBain and other sorts of fiction to Hunter. Reprints of crime-oriented stories and novels written in the 1950s previously attributed to other pseudonyms were reissued under the McBain byline. Hunter stated that the division of names allowed readers to know what to expect: McBain novels had a consistent writing style, while Hunter novels were more varied.

Under the Hunter name, novels steadily appeared throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, including &quot;Come Winter&quot; (1973) and &quot;Lizzie&quot; (1984). Hunter was also successful as screenwriter for film and television. He wrote the screenplay for the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963), loosely adapted from Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s eponymous 1952 novelette. Following &quot;The Birds&quot;, Hunter was again hired by Hitchcock to complete an in-progress script adapting Winston Graham&#x27;s novel &quot;Marnie&quot;. However, Hunter and the director disagreed on how to treat the novel&#x27;s rape scene, and the writer was sacked. Hunter&#x27;s other screenplays included &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; (1960), based on his own 1958 novel; and &quot;Fuzz&quot; (1972), based on his eponymous 1968 87th Precinct novel, which he had written as Ed McBain.

After having thirteen 87th Precinct novels published from 1956 to 1960, further 87th Precinct novels appeared at a rate of approximately one a year until his death. Additionally, NBC ran a police drama called &quot;87th Precinct&quot; during the 1961–62 season, based on McBain&#x27;s work.

From 1978 to 1998, McBain published a series about lawyer Matthew Hope; books in this series appeared every year or two, and usually had titles derived from well-known children&#x27;s stories. For about a decade, from 1984 to 1994, Hunter published no fiction under his own name. In 2000, a novel called &quot;Candyland&quot; appeared that was credited to both Hunter &quot;and&quot; McBain. The two-part novel opened in Hunter&#x27;s psychologically based narrative voice before switching to McBain&#x27;s customary police procedural style.

Aside from McBain, Hunter used at least two other pseudonyms for his fiction after 1960: &quot;Doors&quot; (1975), which was originally attributed to Ezra Hannon before being reissued as a work by McBain, and &quot;Scimitar&quot; (1992), which was credited to John Abbott.

Hunter gave advice to other authors in his article &quot;Dig in and get it done: no-nonsense advice from a prolific author (aka Ed McBain) on starting and finishing your novel&quot;. In it, he advised authors to &quot;find their voice for it is the most important thing in any novel&quot;.

===Dean Hudson controversy===
Hunter was long rumored to have written an unknown number of pornographic novels, as Dean Hudson, for William Hamling&#x27;s publishing houses. Hunter adamantly and consistently denied writing any books as Hudson until he died. However, apparently his agent Scott Meredith sold books to Hamling&#x27;s company as Hunter&#x27;s work (for attribution as &quot;Dean Hudson&quot;) and received payments for these books in cash. While notable, it is not definitive proof: Meredith almost certainly forwarded novels to Hamling by any number of authors, claiming these novels were by Hunter simply to make a sale. Ninety-three novels were published under the Hudson name from 1961 to 1969, and even the most avid proponents of the Hunter-as-Hudson theory do not believe Hunter is responsible for all 93.

===Personal life===
He had three sons: Richard Hunter, an author, speaker, retired advisor to chief information officers on business value and risk issues, and harmonica player; Mark Hunter, an academic, educator, investigative reporter, and author; and Ted Hunter, a painter, who died in 2006.

===Death===
A heavy smoker for many decades, Hunter had three heart attacks over a number of years (his first in 1987) and needed heart surgery. A precancerous lesion was found on his larynx in 1992. This was removed, but the cancer later returned. In 2005, Hunter died in Weston, Connecticut from laryngeal cancer. He was 78.

<doc id="311360" wikidata="Q83174" url="?curid=311360" title="Eugenio Montale">
<text>Eugenio Montale (; 12 October 1896 – 12 September 1981) was an Italian poet, prose writer, editor and translator, recipient of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Literature and one of the finest literary figures of the 20th century.

==Life and works==

===Early years===
Montale was born in Genoa. His family were chemical products traders (his father supplied Italo Svevo&#x27;s firm). Montale was the youngest of six sons.

Montale was largely self-taught. Growing up, his imagination was caught by several writers, including Dante Alighieri, and by the study of foreign languages (especially English), as well as the landscapes of the Levante (&quot;Eastern&quot;) Liguria, where he spent holidays with his family.

===Poetic works===
Montale wrote more than ten anthologies of short lyrics, a journal of poetry translation, plus several books of prose translations, two books of literary criticism, and one of fantasy prose. Alongside his imaginative work he was a constant contributor to Italy&#x27;s most important newspaper, the Corriere della Sera, for which he wrote a huge number of articles on literature, music, and art. He also wrote a foreword to Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, in which he mentions the credibility of Dante, and his insight and unbiased imagination. In 1925 he was a signatory to the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals. Montale&#x27;s own politics inclined toward the liberalism of Piero Gobetti and Benedetto Croce. He contributed to Gobetti&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;Il Baretti&quot;.

Montale&#x27;s work, especially his first poetry collection &quot;Ossi di seppia&quot; (&quot;Cuttlefish Bones&quot;), which appeared in 1925, shows him as an antifascist who felt detached from contemporary life and found solace and refuge in the solitude of nature.

===Anticonformism of the new poetry===
Montale moved to Florence in 1927 to work as an editor for the publisher Bemporad. Florence was the cradle of Italian poetry of that age, with works like the &quot;Canti orfici&quot; by Dino Campana (1914) and the first lyrics by Ungaretti for the review &quot;Lacerba&quot;. Other poets like Umberto Saba and Vincenzo Cardarelli had been highly praised. In 1929 Montale was asked to be chairman of the Gabinetto Vieusseux Library, a post from which he was expelled in 1938 by the fascist government. By this time Montale&#x27;s poetry was a reaction against the literary style of the fascist regime. He collaborated with the magazine &quot;Solaria&quot;, and (starting in 1927) frequented the literary café Le Giubbe Rosse (&quot;Red Jackets&quot;) on the Piazza Vittoria (now Piazza della Repubblica). Visiting the café often several times a day, he became a central figure among a group of writers there, including Carlo Emilio Gadda, Arturo Loria and Elio Vittorini (all founders of the magazine). He wrote for almost all the important literary magazines of the time.

Though hindered by financial problems and the literary and social conformism imposed by the authorities, in Florence, Montale published his finest anthology, &quot;Le occasioni&quot; (&quot;Occasions&quot;, 1939). From 1933 to 1938 he had a love relationship with Irma Brandeis, a Jewish-American scholar of Dante who occasionally visited Italy for short periods. After falling in love with Brandeis, Montale represented her as a mediatrix figure like Dante&#x27;s Beatrice. &quot;Le occasioni&quot; contains numerous allusions to Brandeis, here called Clizia (a senhal). Franco Fortini judged Montale&#x27;s &quot;Ossi di seppia&quot; and &quot;Le occasioni&quot; the high-water mark of 20th century Italian poetry.

T.S. Eliot, who shared Montale&#x27;s admiration for Dante, was an important influence on his poetry at this time; in fact, the new poems of Eliot were shown to Montale by Mario Praz, then teaching in Manchester. The concept of the objective correlative used by Montale in his poetry, was probably influenced by T. S. Eliot. In 1948, for Eliot&#x27;s sixtieth birthday, Montale contributed a celebratory essay entitled &quot;Eliot and Ourselves&quot; to a collection published to mark the occasion.

===Disharmony with the world===
From 1948 to his death, Montale lived in Milan. After the war, he was a member of the liberal Partito d&#x27;Azione. As a contributor to the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; he was music editor and also reported from abroad, including Israel, where he went as a reporter to follow Pope Paul VI&#x27;s visit there. His works as a journalist are collected in &quot;Fuori di casa&quot; (&quot;Out of Home&quot;, 1969).

&quot;La bufera e altro&quot; (&quot;The Storm and Other Things&quot;) was published in 1956 and marks the end of Montale&#x27;s most acclaimed poetry. Here his figure Clizia is joined by La Volpe (&quot;the Fox&quot;), based on the young poet Maria Luisa Spaziani with whom Montale had an affair during the 1950s. However, this volume also features Clizia, treated in a variety of poems as a kind of bird-goddess who defies Hitler. These are some of his greatest poems.

His later works are &quot;Xenia&quot; (1966), &quot;Satura&quot; (1971) and &quot;Diario del &#x27;71 e del &#x27;72&quot; (1973). Montale&#x27;s later poetry is wry and ironic, musing on the critical reaction to his earlier work and on the constantly changing world around him. &quot;Satura&quot; contains a poignant elegy to his wife Drusilla Tanzi. He also wrote a series of poignant poems about Clizia shortly before his death. Montale&#x27;s fame at that point had extended throughout the world. He had received honorary degrees from the Universities of Milan (1961), Cambridge (1967), Rome (1974), and had been named Senator-for-Life in the Italian Senate. In 1973 he was awarded the Golden Wreath of the Struga Poetry Evenings in Struga, SR Macedonia. In 1975 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Montale died in Milan in 1981.

In 1996, a work appeared called &quot;Posthumous Diary&quot; (&quot;Diario postumo&quot;) that purported to have been &#x27;compiled&#x27; by Montale before his death, with the help of the young poet Annalisa Cima; the critic Dante Isella thinks that this work is not authentic. Joseph Brodsky dedicated his essay &quot;In the Shadow of Dante&quot; to Eugenio Montale&#x27;s lyric poetry.

<text>Julia (Classical Latin: &quot;Iulia&quot;) is the nomen of various women of the family Julii Caesares, a branch of the &quot;gens Julia&quot;, one of the most ancient patrician houses at ancient Rome.

By the time of the later Republic, Roman daughters were seldom given personal names, or praenomina, unless there were several sisters in a family, and were instead known by a variety of less formal names when it became necessary to distinguish between them. A first daughter might simply continue to be known by her nomen alone, especially if she were much older than her sisters, or she might become known as &quot;Julia Major&quot; (&quot;the elder&quot;), &quot;Julia Maxima&quot; (&quot;the eldest&quot;), or &quot;Julia Prima&quot; (&quot;the first&quot;). Younger daughters might become known as &quot;Julia Minor&quot; (&quot;the younger&quot;), &quot;Julia Secunda&quot; (&quot;the second&quot;), &quot;Julia Tertia&quot; (&quot;the third&quot;), &quot;Julia Paulla&quot; (&quot;little Julia&quot;), and so forth.

Outside the family, some women became known by a combination of their father&#x27;s nomen and cognomen; the daughter of Lucius Julius Severus would be referred to as &quot;Julia Severa&quot; in order to distinguish her from other women named Julia. But because many names were very common, this was often insufficient to distinguish among individuals. Often women were identified by reference to their fathers or husbands. Julia, the daughter of Sextus Julius Caesar, might be identified as &quot;Julia Caesaris filia&quot; (&quot;Julia, daughter of Caesar&quot;). This particular nomenclature has led to the mistaken belief that &quot;Caesaris&quot; and similar names are the women&#x27;s surnames, although in fact they are merely the genitive forms of masculine names, and refer to other people. Care must be taken to distinguish between these names and women&#x27;s cognomina.

==Wife of Sulla==
Julia (died 104 BC), occasionally called Julia Cornelia by modern scholars, was the first cousin of Caesar&#x27;s father, and the wife of Lucius Cornelius Sulla.

==Wife of Marius==
Julia (died 69 BC) was the paternal aunt of Julius Caesar and the wife of Gaius Marius.

==Mother of Mark Antony==
Julia (c. 104 BC–after 39 BC) was the wife of Marcus Antonius Creticus and mother of Gaius, Lucius Antonius and Mark Antony, the triumvir.

==Elder sister of Julius Caesar==
The elder of the two sisters of the dictator Caesar, Julia Major was twice married, to Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius, although the order of her marriages is not known. Her grandsons, also called Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius, were named Caesar&#x27;s heirs in the dictator&#x27;s will, together with their cousin, Gaius Octavius, grandson of Julia Minor, and the future emperor Augustus. Either this Julia or her sister gave testimony against Publius Clodius Pulcher, when he was impeached for impiety in 61 BC. She should not be confused with Julia the Elder, daughter of Augustus.

==Sister of Julius Caesar and grandmother of Augustus==
The younger of the dictator&#x27;s two sisters, Julia Minor (101–51 BC), also known as Julia the Younger, was the grandmother of Augustus. She should not be confused with Julia the Younger, granddaughter of Augustus.

==Daughter of Julius Caesar==
Julia (c. 76–54 BC) was Julius Caesar&#x27;s only legitimate child to survive to adulthood. Her marriage to Caesar&#x27;s ally Pompeius was an important familial link within the First Triumvirate, and her death in childbirth in 54 BC was one of the events that led to the unraveling of the alliance.

==Julia Augusta==
Livia Drusilla (30 January 58 BC–28 September AD 29) was adopted into her husband&#x27;s family (the &quot;Julii Caesares&quot;) in his will. She became known as Julia Augusta after her adoption.

==Julia the Elder, daughter of Augustus==
Julia the Elder (October 39 BC–AD 14), also known as Julia Major, was the only child of Augustus, from his second marriage with Scribonia.

==Julia the Younger, granddaughter of Augustus==
Vipsania Julia Agrippina (19 BC–AD 29), the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder, also known as Julia the Younger or Julia Minor, was the granddaughter of the first Roman emperor Augustus Caesar. Although a member of the imperial family, she technically belonged to the Vipsanii Agrippae, and was not a member of the Julia gens.

==Julia Livia, daughter of Drusus Julius Caesar==
Julia Livia (c. AD 7–43), was the daughter of Drusus Julius Caesar and Livilla. She was the granddaughter of Tiberius, and the elder sister of Tiberius Gemellus. She is sometimes called Livia Julia, not to be confused with Julia Livia.

==Julia Agrippina==
Julia Agrippina, Agrippina the Younger or Agrippina Minor (AD 15–59) was the eldest daughter of Germanicus. Her father, a member of the gens Claudia by birth, was adopted into the family of the &quot;Julii Caesares&quot; by Tiberius. This Agrippina is rarely referred to as &quot;Julia&quot;.

==Julia Drusilla, sister of Caligula==
The younger sister of Agrippina the Younger and the emperor Caligula, Julia Drusilla, or simply Drusilla (AD 16–38), is seldom referred to as &quot;Julia&quot;.

==Julia Drusilla, daughter of Caligula==
Julia Drusilla (AD 39–41), Caligula&#x27;s daughter, was named after his sister. She was slain when her father was assassinated.

==Julia Livilla==
Julia Livilla (c. AD 18–c. 41) was the youngest child of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder and the youngest sister of the Emperor Caligula.
