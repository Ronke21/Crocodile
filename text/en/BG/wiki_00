<text>The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) is a trade bloc agreement by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations supporting local trade and manufacturing in all ASEAN countries, and facilitating economic integration with regional and international allies. It stands as one of the largest and most important free trade areas (FTA) in the world, and together with its network of dialogue partners, drove some of the world&#x27;s largest multilateral forums and blocs, including Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, East Asia Summit and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

The AFTA agreement was signed on 28 January 1992 in Singapore. When the AFTA agreement was originally signed, ASEAN had six members, namely, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Vietnam joined in 1995, Laos and Myanmar in 1997 and Cambodia in 1999. AFTA now comprises the ten countries of ASEAN. All the four latecomers were required to sign the AFTA agreement to join ASEAN, but were given longer time frames in which to meet AFTA&#x27;s tariff reduction obligations.

The primary goals of AFTA seek to:
* Increase ASEAN&#x27;s competitive edge as a production base in the world market through the elimination, within ASEAN, of tariffs and non-tariff barriers; and
* Attract more foreign direct investment to ASEAN.

The primary mechanism for achieving such goals is the Common Effective Preferential Tariff scheme, which established a phased schedule in 1992 with the goal to increase the &quot;region’s competitive advantage as a production base geared for the world market&quot;.

==History==
1967

* The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established on 8 August 1967 when the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand signed the ASEAN Declaration. 
* The ASEAN Declaration announced the establishment of an Association for Regional Cooperation among the Countries of Southeast Asia, aiming to promote cooperation in the economic, social, cultural, technical, education and other fields.
* It also aims to promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter.

1976

* The first ASEAN Summit (also known as Bali Summit) was held on 23–24 February 1976 in Bali, Indonesia.
* Economic cooperation among ASEAN members was emphasised as the justification for the Summit.
* The establishment of AFTA was strongly resisted by President Suharto from Indonesia.

1977

* The second ASEAN Summit was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
* The major concern was to improve ASEAN’s economic conditions at home by expanding the regionalization with other industrialized nations.
* There were post summit conferences with Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the United States which overshadowed the ASEAN Summit.
* ASEAN emerged as a promising regional organization deserving support.

1987

* The third ASEAN Summit was held on 14–15 December 1987 in Manila, the Philippines.
* In between the second and the third summit, economic cooperation was existent among ASEAN members, whereas economic integration was less favored due to the risk of raising distributional issues and the reduced national political autonomy.
* Economic growth became the central domestic political requirement and economic cooperation turned into the central focus.
* The concept of free trade area was advocated and emphasized in the summit, where further development of the regional counter-trade mechanisms were suggested by several country sources.
* The ambitious “ASEAN Trade Area” was proposed by the ASEAN Economic Research Unit of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.
* The concept of “ASEAN Trade Area” refers to a harmonizing custom union with internal free trade and external tariffs bound to ASEAN goods among member countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei).

1991

* ASEAN started to liberalise trade by employing the CEPT concept, yet avoiding the word “free trade”.
* Prime Minister Anand from Thailand and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong from Singapore came up with the idea of AFTA in July 1991.
* The AFTA concept paper was subsequently developed by Prime Minister Anand and a team led by Suthee Singhasaneh from Thailand.

1992

* The fourth ASEAN Summit was held in Singapore.
*The AFTA agreement was signed on 28 January 1992 in Singapore. 
* The 6 members who signed the agreement were Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
* The agreement was designated to eliminate tariff barriers among the signatories and create a regional market of 500 million people.
* The CEPT scheme was introduced in the agreement to alleviate the tariff on a wide range of products traded within the region.

1993

* AFTA was officially implemented in 1993, where the time frame of application was shortened from 15 to 10 years.
* The integration of CEPT and AFTA was presented by Akrasanee, where the CEPT rates of 0%–5% were defined as free trade rates. Member countries were granted the timing to reduce their tariff rates to 0%–5% within 15 years. Late joiners would be granted a shorter timespan to reduce their tariff rates accordingly.

1995

* Vietnam officially joined ASEAN on 28 July 1995 and has agreed to join AFTA as well.
* Under Vietnam&#x27;s agreement with ASEAN on AFTA, Vietnam will meet the requirements on tariff and non-tariff reductions over a ten year period, beginning on 1 January 1996.

1997

* Laos and Myanmar joined the AFTA agreement on 23 July 1997.
* Both Myanmar and Laos has been given time to reduce tariffs on the local goods to below 5% until 2008.

1999

* Cambodia joined the AFTA agreement on 30 April 1999.
* Cambodia agreed to begin tariff reduction on 1 January 2000 and the deadline to achieve AFTA was 2010.

==The Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme==
Unlike the EU, AFTA does not apply a common external tariff on imported goods. Each ASEAN member may impose tariffs on goods entering from outside ASEAN based on its national schedules. However, for goods originating within ASEAN, ASEAN members are to apply a tariff rate of 0-5 %(the more recent members of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, also known as CMLV countries, were given additional time to implement the reduced tariff rates). This is known as the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme.

ASEAN members have the option of excluding products from the CEPT in three cases: 
1.) Temporary exclusions
2.) Sensitive agricultural products
3.) General exceptions.
Temporary exclusions refer to products for which tariffs will ultimately be lowered to 0-5 %, but which are being protected temporarily by a delay in tariff reductions.

For sensitive agricultural products include commodities such as rice, ASEAN members have until 2010 to reduce the tariff levels to 0-5 %.

General exceptions refer to products which an ASEAN member deems necessary for the protection of national security, public morals, the protection of human, animal or plant life and health, and protection of articles of artistic, historic, or archaeological value.
ASEAN members have agreed to enact zero tariff rates on virtually all imports by 2010 for the original signatories, and 2015 for the CMLV countries.

==Rule of origin==
The CEPT only applies to goods originating within ASEAN. The general rule is that local ASEAN content must be at least 40% of the FOB value of the good. The local ASEAN content can be cumulative, that is, the value of inputs from various ASEAN members can be combined to meet the 40% requirement. The following formula is applied:

:( Raw material cost
:+ Direct labour cost
:+ Direct overhead cost
:+ Profit
:+ Inland transport cost )
:x 100 % FOB value

However, for certain products, special rules apply:
* Change in Chapter Rule for Wheat Flour;
* Change of Tariff Sub-Heading for Wood-Based Products;
* Change in Tariff Classification for Certain Aluminum and Articles thereof.
The exporter must obtain a “Form D” certification from its national government attesting that the good has met the 40% requirement. The Form D must be presented to the customs authority of the importing government to qualify for the CEPT rate. Difficulties have sometimes arisen regarding the evidentiary proof to support the claim, as well as how ASEAN national customs authorities can verify Form D submissions. These difficulties arise because each ASEAN national customs authority interprets and implements the Form D requirements without much co-ordination.

==Administration==
Administration of AFTA is handled by the national customs and trade authorities in each ASEAN member. The ASEAN Secretariat has authority to monitor and ensure compliance with AFTA measures, but has no legal authority to enforce compliance. This has led to inconsistent rulings by ASEAN national authorities. The ASEAN Charter is intended to bolster the ASEAN Secretariat&#x27;s ability to ensure consistent application of AFTA measures.

ASEAN national authorities have also been traditionally reluctant to share or cede sovereignty to authorities from other ASEAN members (although ASEAN trade ministries routinely make cross-border visits to conduct on-site inspections in anti-dumping investigations). Unlike the EU or NAFTA, joint teams to ensure compliance and investigate non-compliance have not been widely used. Instead, ASEAN national authorities must rely on the review and analysis of other ASEAN national authorities to determine if AFTA measures such as rule of origin are being followed. Disagreements may result between the national authorities. Again, the ASEAN Secretariat may help mediate a dispute but has no legal authority to resolve it.

ASEAN has attempted to improve customs co-ordination through the implementation of the ASEAN Single window project. The ASEAN Single Window would allow importers to submit all information related to the transaction to be entered electronically once. This information would then be shared with all other ASEAN national customs authorities.

==Dispute resolution==
Although these ASEAN national customs and trade authorities co-ordinate among themselves, disputes can arise. The ASEAN Secretariat has no legal authority to resolve such disputes, so disputes are resolved bilaterally through informal means or through dispute resolution.

An ASEAN Protocol on Enhanced Dispute Settlement Mechanism governs formal dispute resolution in AFTA and other aspects of ASEAN. ASEAN members may seek mediation and good offices consultations. If these efforts are ineffective, they may ask SEOM (Senior Economic Officials Meetings) to establish panel of independent arbitrators to review the dispute. Panel decisions can be appealed to an appellate body formed by the ASEAN Economic Community Council.

The Protocol has almost never been invoked because of the role of SEOM in the dispute resolution process. SEOM decisions require consensus among all ASEAN members, and since both the aggrieved party and the alleged transgressor are both participating in SEOM, such consensus cannot be achieved. This discourages ASEAN members from invoking the Protocol, and often they seek dispute resolution in other fora such as the WTO or even the International Court of Justice. This can also be frustrating for companies affected by an AFTA dispute, as they have no rights to invoke dispute resolution yet their home ASEAN government may not be willing to invoke the Protocol. The ASEAN Secretary General has listed dispute resolution as requiring necessary reform for proper administration of AFTA and the AEC.

==Further trade facilitation efforts==
Efforts to close the development gap and expand trade among members of ASEAN are key points of policy discussion. According to a 2008 research brief published by the World Bank as part of its Trade Costs and Facilitation Project, ASEAN members have the potential to reap significant benefits from investments in further trade facilitation reform, due to the comprehensive tariff reform already realised through the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.

This new analysis suggests examining two key areas, among others: port facilities and competitiveness in the Internet services sector. Reform in these areas, the report states, could expand ASEAN trade by up to 7.5% ($22 billion) and 5.7% ($17 billion), respectively. By contrast, cutting applied tariffs in all ASEAN members to the regional average in Southeast Asia would increase intra-regional trade by about 2% ($6.3 billion).

<text>Vie (IPA: /&#x27;vi.e/), is a district (or &quot;quarter&quot;), of Oradea, a city in Bihor, Romania. The name means &quot;vineyard&quot; in Romanian.

==Geography==
Vie is situated in the hills overlooking Oradea, in the northern part of the town. It spans quite a large area, from a part just north of the hills but the centre extending quite far into the Oradea hills. Vie is bounded in the south by Republicii Street (&quot;Strada Republicii&quot;), the mainline railway tracks crossing Oradea and the Oradea central railway station (everything south of the railway station is considered part of the city centre, or &quot;Centru&quot;, everything north is considered part of Vie.

==Infrastructure and demographics==
The range of infrastructure in Vie is quite broad – the southern part of the quarter, which is in proximity to the city centre, can be described as suburban, containing either low-rise houses or apartment blocks with up to five storeys. However, as one proceeds north, away from the Oradea city centre, the quarter becomes increasingly rural, with larger houses and larger gardens. Many of the roads in the northern part of Vie are unpaved. The northern part of the quarter contains several vineyards and wine-growing estates.

Additionally, as central Oradea became more expensive and densely populated in the 1990s, Vie became an attractive residential area for the city&#x27;s higher-income population sectors. Nowadays, a large proportion of Vie&#x27;s residents, especially in the northern areas, are high-income earners who have built mansions and large estates due to the fairly low-density profile of the area. This has led to the area being described as a quarter for the elite, even though land prices remain lower than those in the city centre. Vie has been (and remains) attractive for high-income earners because it combines relative proximity to Oradea city centre with the opportunity for a more laid-back, relaxed lifestyle. Many businessmen and politicians may also have a residence (usually a small apartment) in the city centre, while maintaining a larger house in Vie. Many people have also bought investment properties in the area as land prices have soared and continue to rise at a fast rate (in the broader context of Romania&#x27;s economic boom).

==Health==
Apart from high-income housing, and low- and medium-density housing, Vie also contains the Bihor County Hospital (&quot;Spitalul Judeţean&quot;), Oradea&#x27;s major hospital, which was built in the 1970s to replace the older hospital in the city centre, which was becoming too small and cramped for the city&#x27;s needs. Vie is also home to two other major hospitals: the Pulmonary Diseases Hospital (more commonly known as &quot;The Tuberculosis Hospital&quot;, or &quot;Spital TBC&quot;) and the Oradea Mental Hospital. The reason why a wide variety of health infrastructure is available in Vie is due to the relatively low-density of the area as well as a lower amount of pollution than in the city centre or adjacent suburbs.

==Transport==
One area where Vie is lacking is in terms of transport infrastructure. The general lack of transport links to the Oradea city centre have been caused by three main factors, namely:

*the relatively steep terrain of the area
*its low population density and lack of commercial or industrial land uses
*more recently, the presence of high-income earners in the area, a sector of the population which has greater rates of car ownership, therefore creating less demand for public transport services than in other districts of Oradea

These factors, combined with Vie&#x27;s proximity to the city in some parts, have led to the area being served by virtually no public transport, besides the easy access to Oradea&#x27;s main railway station, which is at the southern boundary of Vie, and a bus route (line 13) which links the three hospitals of Vie with the city centre of Oradea (and passes through the quarter&#x27;s main roads). In fact, Vie is the only district in Oradea not to be served by a tram line. Some roads in the quarter, especially those in steeper terrain or in the northern parts, are unpaved, making access more difficult.

<doc id="307488" wikidata="Q1808790" url="?curid=307488" title="Palatalization (phonetics)">
<text>In phonetics, palatalization (, ) or palatization is a way of pronouncing a consonant in which part of the tongue is moved close to the hard palate. Consonants pronounced this way are said to be palatalized and are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by affixing the letter ⟨ʲ⟩ to the base consonant. Palatalization is not phonemic in English, but it is in Slavic languages such as Russian and Ukrainian, Finnic languages such as Estonian, Karelian, and Võro, and other languages such as Irish, Marshallese, Kashmiri, and Japanese.

==Types==
In technical terms, palatalization refers to the secondary articulation of consonants by which the body of the tongue is raised toward the hard palate and the alveolar ridge during the articulation of the consonant. Such consonants are phonetically palatalized. &quot;Pure&quot; palatalization is a modification to the articulation of a consonant, where the middle of the tongue is raised, and nothing else. It may produce a laminal articulation of otherwise apical consonants such as and .

Phonetically palatalized consonants may vary in their exact realization. Some languages add semivowels before or after the palatalized consonant (onglides or offglides). In such cases, the vowel (especially a non-front vowel) following a palatalized consonant typically has a palatal onglide. In Russian, both plain and palatalized consonant phonemes are found in words like , and . In Hupa, on the other hand, the palatalization is heard as both an onglide and an offglide. In some cases, the realization of palatalization may change without any corresponding phonemic change. For example, according to Thurneysen,palatalized consonants at the end of a syllable in Old Irish had a corresponding onglide (reflected as in the spelling), which was no longer present in Middle Irish (based on explicit testimony of grammarians of the time).

In a few languages, including Skolt Sami and many of the Central Chadic languages, palatalization is a suprasegmental feature that affects the pronunciation of an entire syllable, and it may cause certain vowels to be pronounced more front and consonants to be slightly palatalized. In Skolt Sami and its relatives (Kildin Sami and Ter Sami), suprasegmental palatalization contrasts with segmental palatal articulation (palatal consonants).

==Transcription==
In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), palatalized consonants are marked by the modifier letter , a superscript version of the symbol for the palatal approximant . For instance, represents the palatalized form of the voiceless alveolar stop . Prior to 1989, a subscript diacritic was used in the IPA: , apart from two palatalized fricatives which were written instead with curly-tailed variants, namely for and for . (See palatal hook.) The Uralic Phonetic Alphabet marks palatalized consonants by an acute accent, as do some Finnic languages using the Latin alphabet, as in Võro . Others use an apostrophe, as in Karelian ; or digraphs in &quot;j&quot;, as in the Savonian dialects of Finnish, .

==Phonology==
Palatalization has varying phonological significance in different languages. It is allophonic in English, but phonemic in others. In English, consonants are palatalized when they occur before front vowels or the palatal approximant (and in a few other cases), but no words are distinguished by palatalization (complementary distribution), whereas in some of the other languages, the difference between palatalized consonants and plain un-palatalized consonants distinguishes between words, appearing in a contrastive distribution (where one of the two versions, palatalized or not, appears in the same environment as the other).

=== Allophonic palatalization ===
In some languages, like English, palatalization is allophonic. Some phonemes have palatalized allophones in certain contexts, typically before front vowels and unpalatalized allophones elsewhere. Because it is allophonic, palatalization of this type does not distinguish words and often goes unnoticed by native speakers. Phonetic palatalization occurs in American English. Stops are palatalized before the front vowel and not palatalized in other cases.

=== Phonemic palatalization ===
In some languages, palatalization is a distinctive feature that distinguishes two consonant phonemes. This feature occurs in Russian, Irish, and Scottish Gaelic, among others.

Phonemic palatalization may be contrasted with either plain or velarized articulation. In many of the Slavic languages, and some of the Baltic and Finnic languages, palatalized consonants contrast with plain consonants, but in Irish they contrast with velarized consonants.
* Russian &quot;nose&quot; (unpalatalized )
: [nʲɵs] (he) carried&quot; (palatalized )
* Irish &quot;cow&quot; (velarized &quot;b&quot;)
: &quot;alive&quot; (palatalized &quot;b&quot;)

Some palatalized phonemes undergo change beyond phonetic palatalization. For instance, the unpalatalized sibilant (Irish , Scottish ) has a palatalized counterpart that is actually postalveolar , not phonetically palatalized , and the velar fricative in both languages has a palatalized counterpart that is actually palatal rather than palatalized velar . These shifts in primary place of articulation are examples of the sound change of palatalization.

===Morphophonemic===

In some languages, palatalization is used as a morpheme or part of a morpheme. In some cases, a vowel caused a consonant to become palatalized, and then this vowel was lost by elision. Here, there appears to be a phonemic contrast when analysis of the deep structure shows it to be allophonic.

In Romanian, consonants are palatalized before . Palatalized consonants appear at the end of the word, and mark the plural in nouns and adjectives, and the second person singular in verbs. On the surface, it would appear then that &quot;coin&quot; forms a minimal pair with . The interpretation commonly taken, however, is that an underlying morpheme palatalizes the consonant and is subsequently deleted.

Palatalization may also occur as a morphological feature. For example, although Russian makes phonemic contrasts between palatalized and unpalatalized consonants, alternations across morpheme boundaries are normal:
* (&#x27;answer&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;to answer&#x27;)
* (&#x27;[I] carry&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;carries&#x27;)
* (&#x27;hunger&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;hungry&#x27; masc.)

==Sound changes==

In some languages, allophonic palatalization developed into phonemic palatalization by phonemic split. In other languages, phonemes that were originally phonetically palatalized changed further: palatal secondary place of articulation developed into changes in manner of articulation or primary place of articulation.

Phonetic palatalization of a consonant sometimes causes surrounding vowels to change by coarticulation or assimilation. In Russian, &quot;soft&quot; (palatalized) consonants are usually followed by vowels that are relatively more front (that is, closer to or ), and vowels following &quot;hard&quot; (unpalatalized) consonants are further back. See for more information.

==Examples==
===Slavic languages===
In many Slavic languages, palatal or palatalized consonants are called soft, and others are called hard. Some of them, like Russian, have numerous pairs of palatalized and unpalatalized consonant phonemes.

Russian Cyrillic has pairs of vowel letters that mark whether the consonant preceding them is hard/soft:
/,
/, and
The otherwise silent soft sign also indicates that the previous consonant is soft.

===Goidelic===

Irish and Scottish Gaelic have pairs of palatalized (&quot;slender&quot;) and unpalatalized (&quot;broad&quot;) consonant phonemes. In Irish, most broad consonants are velarized. In Scottish Gaelic, the only velarized consonants are and ; is sometimes described as velarized as well.

===Japanese===

&quot;Yōon&quot; are Japanese moras formed with an added sound between the initial consonant and the vowel. For example, 今日 (&quot;kyō&quot;, &quot;today&quot;) is written きょう [], using a small version of よ, while 器用 (&quot;kiyō&quot;, &quot;skillful&quot;) is written きよう [], with a full-sized よ. Historically, &quot;yōon&quot; were not distinguished with the smaller kana and had to be determined by context.

===Marshallese===
In the Marshallese language, each consonant has some type of secondary articulation (palatalization, velarization, or labiovelarization). The palatalized consonants are regarded as &quot;light&quot;, and the velarized and rounded consonants are regarded as &quot;heavy&quot;, with the rounded consonants being both velarized and labialized.

===Norwegian===
Many Norwegian dialects have phonemic palatalized consonants. In many parts of Northern Norway and many areas of Møre og Romsdal, for example, the words (&#x27;hand&#x27;) and /hɑnʲː/ (&#x27;he&#x27;) are differentiated only by the palatalization of the final consonant. Palatalization is generally realised only on stressed syllables, but speakers of the Sør-Trøndelag dialects will generally palatalize the coda of a determined plural as well: e.g. or, in other areas, (&#x27;the dogs&#x27;), rather than *. Norwegian dialects utilizing palatalization will generally palatalize , , and .

<doc id="307491" wikidata="Q180538" url="?curid=307491" title="Fishery">
<text>Fishery can mean either the enterprise of raising or harvesting fish and other aquatic life or, more commonly, the site where such enterprise takes place (, fishing grounds). Commercial fisheries include wild fisheries and fish farms, both in freshwater waterbodies (about 10% of all catch) and the oceans (about 90%). About 500 million people worldwide are economically dependent on fisheries. 171 million tonnes of fish were produced in 2016, but overfishing is an increasing problem, causing declines in some populations. 

Because of their economic and social importance, fisheries are governed by complex fisheries management practices and legal regimes that vary widely across countries. Historically, fisheries were treated with a &quot;first-come, first-served&quot; approach, but recent threats from human overfishing and environmental issues have required increased regulation of fisheries to prevent conflict and increase profitable economic activity on the fishery. Modern jurisdiction over fisheries is often established by a mix of international treaties and local laws. 

Declining fish populations, marine pollution, and the destruction of important coastal ecosystems have introduced increasing uncertainty in important fisheries worldwide, threatening economic security and food security in many parts of the world. These challenges are further complicated by the changes in the ocean caused by climate change, which may extend the range of some fisheries while dramatically reducing the sustainability of other fisheries. 

== Definitions ==
According to the FAO, &quot;...a fishery is an activity leading to harvesting of fish. It may involve capture of wild fish or raising of fish through aquaculture.&quot; It is typically defined in terms of the &quot;people involved, species or type of fish, area of water or seabed, method of fishing, class of boats, purpose of the activities or a combination of the foregoing features&quot;. 

The definition often includes a combination of mammal and fish fishers in a region, the latter fishing for similar species with similar gear types. Some government and private organizations, especially those focusing on recreational fishing include in their definitions not only the fishers, but the fish and habitats upon which the fish depend.

=== The term &quot;fish&quot; ===

* In biology – the term &quot;fish&quot; is most strictly used to describe any aquatic vertebrate that has gills throughout life, and can also refer to those that have limbs (if any) or appendages in the shape of fish fins. Many types of aquatic animals commonly referred to as &quot;fish&quot; are not fish in this strict sense; examples include shellfish, cuttlefish, starfish, crayfish and jellyfish. In the strict sense, all vertebrates are cladistically fish, although colloquially &quot;fish&quot; is a paraphyletic term that only refers to non-tetrapod vertebrates. In earlier times, even biologists did not make any distinction — for instance, 16th century natural historians often classified seals, whales, amphibians, crocodiles and even hippopotamuses, as well as a host of marine invertebrates, as fish.
* In fisheries – the term &quot;fish&quot; is used as a collective term, and includes mollusks, crustaceans and any aquatic animals that are harvested for economic value.
* True fish – The biological definition of a fish (mentioned above) is sometimes called a &quot;true fish&quot;, the vast majority of which are teleosts. True fish are also referred to as &quot;finfish&quot; or &quot;fin fish&quot; to distinguish them from other invertebrate aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.

== Types ==
The fishing industry which harvests fish from fisheries can be divided into three main sectors: commercial, recreational or subsistence. They can be saltwater or freshwater, wild or farmed. About 85 percent of total marine fisheries production was finfish, mainly anchoveta (4.9 million tonnes), Alaska pollock (3.4 million tonnes) and skipjack tuna (3.1 million tonnes). Examples are the salmon fishery of Alaska, the cod fishery off the Lofoten islands, the tuna fishery of the Eastern Pacific, or the shrimp farm fisheries in China. Capture fisheries can be broadly classified as industrial scale, small-scale or artisanal, and recreational.

Close to 90% of the world&#x27;s fishery catches come from oceans and seas, as opposed to inland waters. These marine catches have remained relatively stable since the mid-nineties (between 80 and 86 million tonnes). Most marine fisheries are based near the coast. This is not only because harvesting from relatively shallow waters is easier than in the open ocean, but also because fish are much more abundant near the coastal shelf, due to the abundance of nutrients available there from coastal upwelling and land runoff. However, productive wild fisheries also exist in open oceans, particularly by seamounts, and inland in lakes and rivers.

Most fisheries are wild fisheries, but farmed fisheries are increasing. Farming can occur in coastal areas, such as with oyster farms, or the aquaculture of salmon, but more typically fish farming occurs inland, in lakes, ponds, tanks and other enclosures.

There are commercial fisheries worldwide for finfish, mollusks, crustaceans and echinoderms, and by extension, aquatic plants such as kelp. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world&#x27;s fisheries. Some of these species are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster and scallops. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999, with herring and sardines together providing a harvest of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are harvested in smaller numbers.

In 2022 small-scale fisheries contribute an estimated 40 percent of the global catch and support 90 percent of the capture fisheries workforce, with women representing 40 percent. 500 million people rely on small-scale fisheries for their livelihoods, including 53 million involved in subsistence fishing, of which 45 percent are women.

In 2022 inland fisheries produced 11.3 million tonnes, harvested mainly in Asia (63.4 percent) and Africa (29.4 percent), where they are important for food security. Lead producers were India (1.9 million tonnes), Bangladesh (1.3 million tonnes), China (1.2 million tonnes), Myanmar (0.9 million tonnes) and Indonesia (0.5 million tonnes). Inland fisheries figures are likely underestimated due to the difficulties most countries face in collecting these data.

== Economic importance ==
Directly or indirectly, the livelihood of over 500 million people in developing countries depends on fisheries and aquaculture. Overfishing, including the taking of fish beyond sustainable levels, is reducing fish stocks and employment in many world regions. It was estimated in 2014 that global fisheries were adding US$270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by as much as US$50 billion. In 2022 77% of the global workforce was in Asia, 16% in Africa and 5% in Latin America and the Caribbean. 

In addition to commercial and subsistence fishing, recreational (sport) fishing is popular and economically important in many regions.

=== Production ===

Total fish production in 2016 reached an all-time high of 171 million tonnes, of which 88 percent was utilized for direct human consumption, thanks to relatively stable capture fisheries production, reduced wastage and continued aquaculture growth. This production resulted in a record-high per capita consumption of 20.3 kg in 2016. Since 1961 the annual global growth in fish consumption has been twice as high as population growth. While annual growth of aquaculture has declined in recent years, significant double-digit growth is still recorded in some countries, particularly in Africa and Asia.

FAO predicted in 2018 the following major trends for the period up to 2030:
* World fish production, consumption and trade are expected to increase, but with a growth rate that will slow over time.
* Despite reduced capture fisheries production in China, world capture fisheries production is projected to increase slightly through increased production in other areas if resources are properly managed. Expanding world aquaculture production, although growing more slowly than in the past, is anticipated to fill the supply–demand gap.
* Prices will all increase in nominal terms while declining in real terms, although remaining high.
* Food fish supply will increase in all regions, while per capita fish consumption is expected to decline in Africa, which raises concerns in terms of food security.
* Trade in fish and fish products is expected to increase more slowly than in the past decade, but the share of fish production that is exported is projected to remain stable.

== Management ==
=== Global goals ===
International attention to these issues has been captured in Sustainable Development Goal 14 &quot;Life Below Water&quot; which sets goals for international policy focused on preserving coastal ecosystems and supporting more sustainable economic practices for coastal communities, including in their fishery and aquaculture practices.

<text>The First Vision (also called the grove experience by members of the Community of Christ) refers to a theophany which Latter Day Saints believe Joseph Smith experienced in the early 1820s, in a wooded area in Manchester, New York, called the Sacred Grove. Smith described it as a vision in which he received instruction from God the Father and Jesus Christ.

According to the account Smith told in 1838, he went to the woods to pray about which church to join but fell into the grip of an evil power that nearly overcame him. At the last moment, he was rescued by two shining &quot;Personages&quot; (implied to be God the Father and Jesus) who hovered above him. One of the beings told Smith not to join any of the existing churches because they all taught incorrect doctrines.

Smith wrote several accounts of the vision between 1832 and 1842, two of which were published in his lifetime. Consistency of the accounts is a subject of debate, whether variations are indicators of significant shifts in Smith&#x27;s theology or are simply changing emphasis of minor details. The First Vision is revered in Latter-day Saint theology as the first step in the Latter Day Saint restoration, but it was relatively unknown to early adherents to the Latter Day Saint movement; Smith&#x27;s experience was published in 1842 and canonized in 1880 but not emphasized in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) until the early 20th century. For Latter-day Saints, the First Vision corroborates distinctive doctrines such as the bodily nature of God the Father and the uniqueness of the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ as the only true path to exaltation.

==Story of the vision==
Smith wrote or dictated several versions of his vision story, and told the story to others who later published what they remember hearing. Taken together, these accounts set forth the following details:
Smith said that when he was about twelve (c. 1817–18), he became interested in religion and distressed about his sins. He studied the Bible and attended church, but the accounts differ as to whether he determined on his own that there was no existing religion built upon the true teachings of Jesus or whether the idea that all churches were false had not &quot;entered his heart&quot; until he experienced the vision. During this period of religious concern, he determined to turn to God in prayer. An early account says the purpose of this prayer was to ask God for mercy for his sins while later accounts emphasize his desire to know which church he should join. Smith said he went one spring morning to a secluded grove near his home to pray. He said he went to a stump in a clearing where he had left his axe the day before and began to offer his first audible prayer.

He said his prayer was interrupted by a &quot;being from the unseen world.&quot; Smith said the being caused his tongue to swell in his mouth so that he could not speak. One account said he heard a noise behind him like someone walking towards him and then, when he tried to pray again, the noise grew louder, causing him to spring to his feet and look around, but he saw no one. In some of the accounts, he described being covered with a thick darkness and thinking that he would be destroyed. At his darkest moment, he knelt a third time to pray and, as he summoned all his power to pray, he felt ready to sink into oblivion. At that moment, he said his tongue was loosed and he saw a vision.

Smith said he saw a pillar of light brighter than the noonday sun that slowly descended on him, growing in brightness as it descended and lighting the entire area for some distance. As the light reached the tree tops, Smith feared the trees might catch fire. But when it reached the ground and enveloped him, it produced a &quot;peculiar sensation.&quot; &quot;[H]is mind was caught away from the natural objects with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision.&quot;

While experiencing the vision, he said he saw one or more &quot;personages&quot;, described differently in Smith&#x27;s accounts. In his earliest written account, Smith said he &quot;saw the Lord.&quot; In diary entries, he said he saw a &quot;visitation of Angels&quot; or a &quot;vision of angels&quot; that included &quot;a personage,&quot; and then &quot;another personage&quot; who testified that &quot;Jesus Christ is the Son of God,&quot; as well as &quot;many angels&quot;. In later accounts, Smith consistently said that he had seen two personages who appeared one after the other. These personages &quot;exactly resembled each other in their features or likeness.&quot; The first personage had &quot;light complexion, blue eyes, a piece of white cloth drawn over his shoulders, his right arm bare.&quot; In later accounts, one of the personages called Smith by name &quot;and said, (pointing to the other), &#x27;This is my beloved Son, hear him.&#x27;&quot; Although Smith did not explicitly identify the personages, most Latter Day Saints infer that they were God the Father and Jesus.

In two accounts, Smith said that the Lord told him his sins were forgiven, that he should obey the commandments, that the world was corrupt, and that the Second Coming was approaching. Later accounts say that when the personages appeared, Smith asked them &quot;O Lord, what church shall I join?&quot; or &quot;Must I join the Methodist Church?&quot; In answer, he was told that &quot;all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom.&quot; All churches and their professors were &quot;corrupt&quot;, and &quot;all their creeds were an abomination in his sight.&quot; Smith was told not to join any of the churches, but that the fullness of the gospel would be made known to him at a later time. After the vision withdrew, Smith said he came to and found himself sprawled on his back.

==Context==

===Background===

Smith was born on December 23, 1805, in Vermont, and in 1816, his family moved to a farm just outside the town of Palmyra, New York. In the first several decades of American society in the 1800s, there was a proliferation of religious options. During the Second Great Awakening, revivals occurred in many communities in the northeastern United States. The religious environment in the region where the Smith family lived was so intense it is referred to today as the burned-over district. In the Palmyra area itself, large multi-denominational revivals occurred in 1816–17 and 1824–25. Within eight miles of the Smith family farm, at least four Methodist, three Presbyterian, two Baptist, and several Quaker groups held regular meetings. Despite the large number of congregations however, only about 11% of Palmyra residents belonged to any organized religion in 1820, which was in line with the national average.

Besides organized religion, the Smith family was exposed to a number of other belief systems. A large ill-defined group of early Americans have been lumped into the term &quot;seekers&quot;. This group held a heterogeneous set of beliefs; including that religion with creeds were unnecessary and the apostolic church no longer was on the earth. Cunning folk traditions or folk magic was also prevalent in Palmyra; intertwined and considered congruous with Christianity. Deism, the belief that God exists but does not intervene in earth, also had a growing hold in American culture with the publication of Thomas Paine&#x27;s popular book &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;.
Richard Bushman has called the spiritual tradition of the Smith family &quot;a religious melee.&quot; Like many other Americans living on the frontier at the beginning of the 19th century, Smith and his family believed in visions, dreams, and other communications with God. In 1811, Smith&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Solomon Mack, described a series of visions and voices from God that resulted in his conversion to Christianity at the age of seventy-six.

Joseph Smith&#x27;s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, had a &quot;believers baptism&quot; early in her marriage, but did not formally join to any denomination early in her marriage. Joseph Smith Sr. was a combination of deist and seeker, who was skeptical of organized religion, but not irreligious. Before Smith was born, Lucy went to a grove near her home in Vermont and prayed about her husband&#x27;s repudiation of evangelical religion. That night she said she had a dream which she interpreted as a prophecy that Joseph Sr. would later accept the &quot;pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God.&quot; She also stated that Smith Sr. had a number of dreams or visions between 1811 and 1819, the first of which occurring when his mind was &quot;much excited upon the subject of religion.&quot; The first of Joseph Sr.&#x27;s visions confirmed to him the correctness of his refusal to join any organized religious group. Smith&#x27;s father additionally joined the local masonic lodge, with Smith&#x27;s older brother Hyrum sometime shortly after arriving in Palmyra.

Smith&#x27;s older brother Alvin did not join any organized religion. Lucy said that after Alvin died in late 1823, she sought comfort in religion, and formally joined the Presbyterian church in either 1824 or 1825 along with her children Hyrum, Samuel and Sophronia.

===Dating the First Vision===
Smith never gave a specific date of his reported vision, but said it occurred in the early 1820s, when he was in his early teens. In the 1832 account Smith says that from age twelve to fifteen he was pondering the situation of the world in his heart, placing the vision in 1821. Smith&#x27;s scribe Frederick G. Williams inserted into the 1832 account that it had occurred &quot;in the 16th year of [his] age&quot; or 1821. In the 1838 account, Smith said the vision took place &quot;early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty.&quot; In both his 1835 and 1842 account, Smith wrote that it occurred when &quot;about fourteen years of age.&quot;

Historians have looked at contextual clues from the accounts to further narrow down the date. In the 1838 account Smith noted the following events:

* &quot;Sometime in the second year after our removal to Manchester, there was in the place where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion&quot;
* &quot;(The unusual excitement) commenced with the Methodist&quot;
* &quot;(The unusual excitement) soon became general among all the sects in that region of country, ... and great multitudes united themselves to the different religious parties, which created no small stir and division among the people&quot;
* &quot;My Fathers family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith and four of them joined that Church, Namely, My Mother Lucy, My Brothers Hyrum, Samuel Harrison, and my Sister Sophronia.&quot;
* &quot;It was on the morning of a beautiful clear day early in the spring&quot;

Each of these details have been the subject of significant research and debated widely among historians, critics, apologists and polemicists, sparking a variety of historical and theological interpretations. In the fall of 1967 the Reverend Wesley P. Walters published a pamphlet asserting that the &quot;unusual excitement&quot; Joseph Smith wrote of matched the Palmyra revival of 1824, and was anachronistic to the 1820 setting. Walters&#x27; pamphlet created a stir, and provoked a strong response from scholars at Brigham Young University (BYU). By spring of 1968 BYU Professor Truman G. Madsen organized around three dozen scholars to respond to Walters, and wrote to the First Presidency of the LDS Church that the &quot;first vision has come under severe historical attack.&quot; Walters&#x27;s thesis and the subsequent response has framed the historical debate.

====Dating the move to Manchester====
Local moves of the Smith family have been used in attempts to identify the date of the vision. Smith wrote that the First Vision occurred in &quot;the second year after our removal to Manchester.&quot; The evidence for the date of this move has been interpreted by many believers as supporting 1820 and by non-believers as supporting 1824. Manchester land assessment records show an increase in assessed value of the Smith property in 1823. Because the tax assessment of the Smiths&#x27; Manchester land rose in 1823, critics argue that the Smiths completed their Manchester cabin in 1822, which suggests an approximate date of 1824 for the First Vision. Joseph Smith Sr. was first taxed for Manchester land in 1820. In 1821 and 1822, the land was valued at $700, but in 1823, the property was assessed at $1000, which may indicate &quot;that the Smiths had completed construction of their cabin and cleared a significant portion of their land&quot;. In response, some Mormon apologists argue that in 1818, the Smiths mistakenly constructed a cabin 59 feet north of the actual property line (which would have been in Palmyra rather than Manchester) and the 1823 increase in the property assessment was related to the completion of a wood frame home on the Manchester side of the Palmyra–Manchester township line. The latter interpretation would lend support for dating the First Vision to 1820.

====Dating the revival====

Richard Bushman wrote that Smith &quot;began to be concerned about religion in late 1817 or early 1818, when the aftereffects of the revival of 1816 and 1817 were still being felt.&quot; Milton V. Backman wrote that religious outbreaks occurred in 1819–20 within a fifty-mile radius of Smith&#x27;s home: &quot;Church records, newspapers, religious journals, and other contemporary sources clearly reveal that great awakenings occurred in more than fifty western New York towns or villages during the revival of 1819–1820 ... Primary sources also specify that great multitudes joined the Methodist, Presbyterian, and Calvinist Baptist societies in the region of country where Joseph Smith lived.&quot; Richard Lloyd Anderson has pointed out that there was a Methodist Camp Meeting in Palmyra in 1818, with about 400 in attendance, that is verified by a contemporary journal. This agrees with the three-year time frame of his pondering on religion mentioned in Smith&#x27;s 1832 account. Backman cited evidence of a Methodist Camp Meeting in Palmyra in June 1820.

====Dating the Smith family conversions to Presbyterianism====
In the 1838 version of the First Vision (first published in 1842) that has been canonized by the LDS Church, his family&#x27;s decision to join the Presbyterian Church occurs in the same year as his First Vision.

The draft copy of Lucy Mack Smith&#x27;s history does not mention the first vision at all. However, the fair copy, penned by the same scribe as the draft copy, and which was in the possession of Lucy and on which she registered a copyright, includes in the narrative a copy of the 1838 version of the first vision, beginning with Joseph&#x27;s words &quot;I was at this time in my fifteenth year.&quot; After the first vision account, Lucy continues with &quot;From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval of very great importance...&quot; At this point Lucy describes the visitations of Moroni and the promise of the golden plates, followed by the death of Alvin, in November 1823.

Lucy then states that she and some of her children sought comfort in the religious revival after Alvin&#x27;s death. This statement has been taken to refer to her and three of the children (Hyrum, Samuel, and Sophronia) joining the Presbyterian church. If so, and if Joseph&#x27;s statement that they joined this church in the same year as his first vision is accurate, then the first vision would have taken place in 1824. However, this conclusion requires ignoring both Joseph&#x27;s statement that the first vision occurred during his fifteenth year and Lucy&#x27;s chronology in the fair copy. Alternatively, D. Michael Quinn says that Joseph Smith&#x27;s account is a conflation of events over several years, a typical biographical device for streamlining the narrative.

====Dating the &quot;beautiful, clear day&quot;====
In the 1838 account Smith said that this vision occurred &quot;on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty.&quot; Two LDS Church members collaborated and detailed a claim on their website that the date was March 26, 1820 relying on an interpretation of the Enoch calendar to calculate the date along with weather reports and maple sugar production records. Mark Staker, an expert on the sacred grove site, states that early spring would be &quot;sometime in most likely March, April, or the beginning weeks of May.&quot;

==Recorded accounts of the vision==

The importance of the First Vision within the Latter Day Saint movement evolved over time. There is little evidence that Smith discussed the First Vision publicly prior to 1830. Mormon historian James B. Allen notes that:

 The fact that none of the available contemporary writings about Joseph Smith in the 1830s, none of the publications of the Church in that decade, and no contemporary journal or correspondence yet discovered mentions the story of the first vision is convincing evidence that at best it received only limited circulation in those early days.

===1830s reference to early Christian regeneration===

In June 1830, Smith provided the first clear record of a significant personal religious experience prior to the visit of the angel Moroni. At that time, Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery were establishing the Church of Christ, the first Latter Day Saint church. In the &quot;Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ,&quot; Smith recounted his early history, noting

&quot;For, after that it truly was manifested unto [Smith] that he had received remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world, but after truly repenting, God visited him by an holy angel ... and gave unto him power, by the means which was before prepared that he should translate a book.&quot;

No further explanation of this &quot;manifestation&quot; is provided. Although the reference was later linked to the First Vision, its original hearers would have understood the manifestation as simply another of many revival experiences in which the subject testified that his sins had been forgiven.

===1832 Smith account===
The earliest extant account of the First Vision was handwritten by Smith in 1832 in a letter book, but its existence was not known outside the Church History department until it was published in 1965. Sometime around 1930, the pages on which the account was written were torn from the letter book, removed from the Church Historian&#x27;s collection and placed into a private safe in the custody of Apostle Joseph Fielding Smith. In 1952, General Authority Levi E. Young met with amateur historian LaMar Peterson and told him of a &quot;strange account&quot; in Joseph&#x27;s handwriting that did not mention God the Father. In 1964, Peterson told Jerald and Sandra Tanner about the account, and they subsequently asked permission from Joseph Fielding Smith to see it, but were denied. In 1964, Smith authorized the showing of the account to Paul R. Cheesman, a BYU student working on his master&#x27;s thesis. The Tanners obtained a copy of the thesis transcript and the account was published for the first time in 1965.

[T]he Lord heard my cry in the wilderness and while in &lt;the&gt; attitude of calling upon the Lord &lt;in the 16th year of my age&gt; a pillar of fire light above the brightness of the sun at noon day come down from above and rested upon me and I was filled with the spirit of god and the &lt;Lord&gt; opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying Joseph &lt;my son&gt; thy sins are forgiven thee. go thy &lt;way&gt; walk in my statutes and keep my commandments behold I am the Lord of glory I was crucifyed for the world that all those who believe on my name may have Eternal life &lt;behold&gt; the world lieth in sin and at this time and none doeth good no not one they have turned aside from the gospel and keep not &lt;my&gt; commandments they draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me and mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth to visit them according to th[e]ir ungodliness and to bring to pass that which &lt;hath&gt; been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and Ap[o]stles behold and lo I come quickly as it [is] written of me in the cloud &lt;clothed&gt; in the glory of my Father ...&quot;

Unlike Smith&#x27;s later accounts of the vision, the 1832 account emphasizes personal forgiveness and mentions neither an appearance of God the Father nor the phrase &quot;This is my beloved Son, hear him.&quot; In the 1832 account, Smith also stated that before he experienced the First Vision, his own searching of the scriptures had led him to the conclusion that mankind had &quot;apostatized from the true and living faith and there was no society or denomination that built upon the Gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the new testament.&quot;

===1834 Cowdery account===
In several issues of the Mormon periodical &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot; (1834–35), Oliver Cowdery wrote an early biography of Smith. In one issue, Cowdery explained that Smith was confused by the different religions and local revivals during his &quot;15th year&quot; (1820), leading him to wonder which church was the true one. In the next issue of the biography, Cowdery explained that reference to Smith&#x27;s &quot;15th year&quot; was a typographical error, and that actually the revivals and religious confusion took place in Smith&#x27;s &quot;17th year.&quot;

Therefore, according to Cowdery, the religious confusion led Smith to pray in his bedroom, late on the night of September 23, 1823, after the others had gone to sleep, to know which of the competing denominations was correct and whether &quot;a Supreme being did exist.&quot; In response, an angel appeared and granted him forgiveness of his sins. The remainder of the story roughly parallels Smith&#x27;s later description of a visit by an angel in 1823 who told him about the golden plates. Thus, Cowdery&#x27;s account, containing a single vision, differs from Smith&#x27;s 1832 account, which contains two separate visions, one in 1821 prompted by religious confusion (the First Vision) and a separate one regarding the plates on September 22, 1822. Cowdery&#x27;s account also differs from Smith&#x27;s 1842 account, which includes a First Vision in 1820 and a second vision on September 22, 1823.

===1835 Smith accounts===
On November 9, 1835, Smith dictated an account of the First Vision in his diary after telling it to a stranger who had visited his home earlier that day. Smith said that when perplexed about religions matters, he had gone to a grove to pray but that his tongue seemed swollen in his mouth and that he had been interrupted twice by the sound of someone walking behind him. Finally, as he prayed, he said his tongue was loosed, and he saw a pillar of fire in which an unidentified &quot;personage&quot; appeared. Then another unidentified personage told Smith his sins were forgiven and &quot;testified unto [Smith] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&quot; An interlineation in the text notes, &quot;and I saw many angels in this vision.&quot; Smith said this vision occurred when he was 14 years old and that when he was 17, he &quot;saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed&quot; (referring to the later visit of the angel Moroni who showed him the location of the golden plates). Smith identified none of these personages or angels with &quot;the Lord&quot; as he had in 1832.

A few days later, on November 14, 1835, Smith told the story to another visitor, Erastus Holmes. In his journal, Smith said that he had recited his life story &quot;up to the time I received the first visitation of angels, which was when I was about fourteen years old.&quot;

===1838 Smith account===

In 1838, Smith began dictating a history, introduced as &quot;I have been induced to write this history ... in relation both to myself and the Church.&quot; This history included a new account of the First Vision, later published in three issues of &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;. This version was later incorporated into the Pearl of Great Price, which was canonized by the LDS Church in 1880, as Joseph Smith–History. Thus, it is often called the &quot;canonized version&quot; of the First Vision story.

This version differs from the 1840 version because it includes the proclamation, &quot;This is My Beloved Son, hear Him&quot; from one of the personages, whereas the 1840 version does not. The canonized version says that in the spring of 1820, during a period of &quot;confusion and strife among the different denominations&quot; following an &quot;unusual excitement on the subject of religion&quot;, Smith had debated which of the various Christian groups he should join. While in turmoil, he read from the Epistle of James: &quot;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.&quot;

One morning, deeply impressed by this scripture, the fourteen-year-old Smith went to the woods near his home, knelt, and began his first vocal prayer. Almost immediately he was confronted by an evil power that prevented speech. A darkness gathered around him, and Smith believed that he would be destroyed. He continued the prayer silently, asking for God&#x27;s assistance though still resigned to destruction. At this moment a light brighter than the sun descended towards him, and he was delivered from the evil power.

In the light, Smith &quot;saw two personages standing in the air&quot;. One pointed to the other and said, &quot;This is My Beloved Son, hear Him.&quot; Smith asked which religious sect he should join and was told to join none of them because all existing religions had corrupted the teachings of Jesus Christ.

In his 1838 account, Smith wrote that he made an oblique reference to the vision to his mother in 1820, telling her the day it happened that he had &quot;learned for [him]self that Presbyterianism is not true.&quot; Lucy did not mention this conversation in her memoirs in her own words, but included the narrative from Joseph&#x27;s 1838 account directly.

Smith wrote he &quot;could find none that would believe&quot; his experience. He said that shortly after the experience, he told the story of his revelation to a Methodist minister who responded &quot;with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there was no such thing as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there never would be any more of them.&quot; He also said that the telling of his vision story &quot;excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase.&quot; There is no extant evidence from the 1830s for this persecution beyond Smith&#x27;s own testimony. None of the earliest anti-Mormon literature mentioned the First Vision. Smith also said he told others about the vision during the 1820s, and some family members said that they had heard him mention it, but none prior to 1823, when Smith said he had his second vision. Joseph&#x27;s mother recorded the 1820-23 persecution of Joseph in her memoir, stating &quot;From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval occurred of very great importance; though he suffered, as one would naturally suppose every kind of opposition and persecution from the different orders of religion.&quot;

===1840 Pratt account===
In September 1840, Orson Pratt published a version of the First Vision in England. This version states that after Smith saw the light, &quot;his mind was caught away, from the natural objects with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision.&quot; Pratt&#x27;s account referred to &quot;two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in their features or likeness&quot;.

===1842 Wentworth Letter===
In 1842, two years before his death, Smith wrote to John Wentworth, editor of the &quot;Chicago Democrat&quot;, outlining the basic beliefs of his church and including an account of the First Vision. Smith said that he had been &quot;about fourteen years of age&quot; when he had received the First Vision. Like the Pratt account, Smith&#x27;s Wentworth letter said that his &quot;mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision.&quot; and had seen &quot;two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features, and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day.&quot; Smith said he was told that no religious denomination &quot;was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom&quot; and that he was &quot;expressly commanded to &#x27;go not after them.&#x27;&quot;

===Smith&#x27;s accounts found in later reminiscences===
In the rough draft of her autobiography, Smith&#x27;s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, describes her son being visited in 1823 by an angel, who told him &quot;...there is not a true church on the Earth,&quot; but does not include a First Vision narrative. The fair copy of the autobiography, prepared under Lucy&#x27;s direction by the scribe who had also penned the rough draft, includes in the narrative a copy of the 1838 version of the First Vision from &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;.

Late in his life, Smith&#x27;s brother William gave two accounts of the First Vision, dating it to 1823, when William was twelve years old. William said the religious excitement in Palmyra had occurred in 1822–23 (rather than the actual date of 1824–25); that it was stimulated by the preaching of a Methodist, the Rev. George Lane, a &quot;great revival preacher&quot;; and that his mother and some of his siblings had then joined the Presbyterian church.

William Smith said he based his account on what Joseph had told William and the rest of his family the day after the First Vision:

[A] light appeared in the heavens, and descended until it rested upon the trees where he was. It appeared like fire. But to his great astonishment, did not burn the trees. An angel then appeared to him and conversed with him upon many things. He told him that none of the sects were right; but that if he was faithful in keeping the commandments he should receive, the true way should be made known to him; that his sins were forgiven, etc.

In an 1884 account, William also stated that when Joseph first saw the light above the trees in the grove, he fell unconscious for an undetermined amount of time, after which he awoke and heard &quot;the personage whom he saw&quot; speak to him.

=== Other accounts of the vision ===
This is an incomplete list of various accounts of the first vision.

==== Secondhand accounts ====
==== Reminicences and Records of other early Latter-Day Saints ====
==Comparison of written accounts==

In the first written accounts of the First Vision, the central theme is personal forgiveness, while in later accounts the focus shifts to the apostasy and corruption of churches. In early accounts, Smith seems reluctant to talk about the vision; in later versions, various details are mentioned that were not mentioned in the earliest narratives.

Jerald and Sandra Tanner cite the multiple versions of the First Vision as evidence that it may have been fabricated by Smith. For instance, they have specifically pointed out that it is unclear between various versions whether Smith was 14 or 15 at the time of the vision; whether he attended a contemporaneous religious revival; whether the supernatural personages told Smith that his sins were forgiven; whether the personages were angels, Jesus, God, or some combination; and whether Smith had already determined for himself that all churches were false before he experienced the vision. However, Stephen Prothero argues that any historian should expect to find differences in narratives written many years apart, and that the key elements are present in all the accounts.

Some believers view differences in the accounts as overstated. Richard L. Anderson wrote, &quot;What are the main problems of interpreting so many accounts? The first problem is the interpreter. One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences.&quot; Other believers view the differences in the accounts as reflective of Smith&#x27;s increase in maturity and knowledge over time.

The following table compares elements of First Vision accounts:
Accounts of others:

==Interpretations and responses to the vision==
Smith said that he was persecuted by local &quot;professors of religion&quot; after sharing his story. Historian D. Michael Quinn noted that at the time, the Smith family practiced various Cunning Folk traditions that were criticized by leaders of organized religion, and that Smith&#x27;s vision may have given Smith confidence to ignore those leaders and continue being an active participant in the Cunning Folk culture.

Among contemporary denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement, the First Vision is typically viewed as a significant (often the &quot;most&quot; significant) event in the latter day restoration of the Church of Christ. However, the faiths differ in their teachings about the vision&#x27;s precise meaning and details. Secular scholars and non-Mormons view the vision as a deliberate deception, false memory, delusion, or hallucination, or some combination of these.

===The Godhead in Latter Day Saint theology===

The first vision is often used to illustrate various LDS doctrines about the attributes of God and the nature of the Godhead. The LDS Church teaches that the vision shows that the members of the Godhead are three separate beings.

In academia it is assumed that differences in Smith&#x27;s first vision accounts reflect an evolving concept of the Godhead. For example, references to God in the early writings by Smith, including the Book of Mormon, can be seen as more Trinitarian or modalistic, where God is a single entity, but manifests himself in different modes, sometimes as the Father, sometimes as the Son, but always as an expression of the same one God. Modalism was common in upstate New York at the time, so the appearance of a single personage (Jesus) in Smith&#x27;s 1832 account would be consistent with prevailing modalistic thought.

Smith&#x27;s early revelations and writings frequently referred to the Father and the Son being one, but after May 1833, he never again referred to God the Father and Jesus as being one. In 1835, the Lectures on Faith were published as part of the Doctrine and Covenants, teaching a form of Binitarianism where the Father is a &quot;personage of the spirit&quot; and the Son is a &quot;personage of tabernacle&quot; looking exactly the same in appearance, with the Holy Ghost being the shared mind between them. Joseph Smith&#x27;s later accounts of the First Vision reflects the theology of the Lectures on Faith, for example, the 1835 account notes that &quot;a personage appeared in the midst of this pillar of flame, ... Another personage soon appeared, like unto the first.&quot; By the 1840s Smith was teaching a form of social trinitarianism—that members of the Godhead were separate and distinct individuals united in purpose.

LDS Church scholars generally do not accept the view that the early Latter Day Saints were modalists or binitarian. Smith himself also rejected criticism that his views of God had changed, saying &quot;I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods.&quot;

===Early awareness by Latter Day Saints===
The importance of the First Vision within the Latter Day Saint movement evolved over time. Early adherents were unaware of the details of the vision until 1840, when the earliest accounts were published in Great Britain. An account of the First Vision was not published in the United States until 1842, shortly before Smith&#x27;s death. Jan Shipps has written that the vision was &quot;practically unknown&quot; until an account of it was published in 1842. LDS historian Richard Bushman wrote, &quot;At first, Joseph was reluctant to talk about his vision. Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision.&quot;

===Interpretation and use by the LDS Church===
According to the LDS Church, the vision teaches that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate beings with glorified bodies of flesh and bone; that mankind was literally created in the image of God; that Satan is real but God infinitely greater; that God hears and answers prayer; that no other contemporary church had the fullness of Christ&#x27;s gospel; and that revelation has not ceased. In the 21st century, the vision features prominently in the Church&#x27;s program of proselytism.

An official website of the LDS Church calls the First Vision &quot;the greatest event in world history since the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.&quot; In 1998, church president Gordon B. Hinckley declared,
Our entire case as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rests on the validity of this glorious First Vision. It was the parting of the curtain to open this, the dispensation of the fullness of times. Nothing on which we base our doctrine, nothing we teach, nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration. I submit that if Joseph Smith talked with God the Father and His Beloved Son, then all else of which he spoke is true. This is the hinge on which turns the gate that leads to the path of salvation and eternal life. In 1961, Hinckley had gone further: &quot;Either Joseph Smith talked with the Father and the Son or he did not. If he did not, we are engaged in a blasphemy.&quot; Likewise, in a January 2007 interview conducted for the PBS documentary &quot;The Mormons&quot;, Hinckley said of the First Vision, &quot;it&#x27;s either true or false. If it&#x27;s false, we&#x27;re engaged in a great fraud. If it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s the most important thing in the world ... That&#x27;s our claim. That&#x27;s where we stand, and that&#x27;s where we fall, if we fall. But we don&#x27;t. We just stand secure in that faith.&quot;

A 2012 Pew Research survey of self-identified members of the LDS Church asked how important believing that Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ was to being a &quot;good Mormon.&quot; 80% responded that it was essential, 13% responded that it was important but not essential, and 6% responded that it was either not too, or not at all essential.

====Historical usage====

The canonical First Vision story was not emphasized in the sermons of Smith&#x27;s immediate successors, Brigham Young and John Taylor, within the LDS Church. Hugh Nibley noted that although a &quot;favorite theme of Brigham Young&#x27;s was the tangible, personal nature of God,&quot; he &quot;never illustrates [the theme] by any mention of the first vision.&quot; This is not to say that Young did not teach about the First Vision, since he clearly did on multiple occasions.

Taylor gave a complete account of the First Vision story in an 1850 letter written as he began missionary work in France, and he may have alluded to it in a discourse given in 1859. Throughout the late 1870s and 1880s, Taylor made multiple, explicit references to the First Vision in his sermons, books and letters. These included his 1886 letter to his family, one of his last major theological pronouncements in which he stated &quot;God revealed Himself, as also the Lord Jesus Christ, unto his servant the Prophet Joseph Smith&quot;.

Three non-Mormon students of Mormonism, Douglas Davies, Kurt Widmer, and Jan Shipps, agree that the church&#x27;s emphasis on the First Vision was a &quot;&#x27;late development&#x27;, only gaining an influential status in LDS reflection late in the nineteenth century.&quot; The first important visual representation of the First Vision was painted by the Danish convert C. C. A. Christensen sometime between 1869 and 1878; George Manwaring, inspired by the artist, wrote a hymn about the First Vision (&quot;Oh, How Lovely Was the Morning&quot;, later renamed &quot;Joseph Smith&#x27;s First Prayer&quot;), first published in 1884.

Widmer states that it was primarily through &quot;the post 1883 sermons of Latter-day Saint Apostle George Q. Cannon that the modern interpretation and significance of the First Vision in Mormonism began to take shape.&quot; As the sympathetic but non-Mormon historian Jan Shipps has written, &quot;When the first generation of leadership died off, leaving the community to be guided mainly by men who had not known Joseph, the First Vision emerged as a symbol that could keep the slain Mormon leader at center stage.&quot; The centennial anniversary of the vision in 1920 &quot;was a far cry from the almost total lack of reference to it just fifty years before.&quot; By 1939, even George D. Pyper, the Church&#x27;s Sunday School superintendent and manager of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, found it &quot;surprising that none of the first song writers wrote intimately of the first vision.&quot;

Church president Joseph F. Smith helped raise the First Vision to its modern status as a pillar of church theology. Largely through Joseph F. Smith&#x27;s influence, Smith&#x27;s 1838 account of the First Vision became part of the canon of the church in 1880 when the faith canonized Smith&#x27;s early history as part of the Pearl of Great Price. After plural marriage ended at the turn of the 20th century, Joseph F. Smith heavily promoted the First Vision, and it soon replaced polygamy in the minds of adherents as the main defining element of Mormonism and the source of the faith&#x27;s perception of persecution by outsiders. From 1905 to 1912, the story of the First Vision began to be incorporated into church histories, missionary tracts, and Sunday school lesson manuals. As a result, belief in the First Vision is now considered fundamental to the faith, second in importance only to belief in the divinity of Jesus.

In 1920, the LDS Church held a commemoration in the Sacred Grove to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the First Vision. At the 200th anniversary in 2020, a video recording of church president Russell M. Nelson reading &quot;The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World&quot; in the grove was released at the church&#x27;s general conference.

===Perspectives within the Community of Christ===
The Community of Christ generally refers to the First Vision as the &quot;grove experience&quot; and takes a flexible view about its historicity, emphasizing &quot;the healing presence of God and the forgiving mercy of Christ&quot; felt by Joseph Smith. The modern church is Trinitarian, and in contrast to the LDS Church, does not use the First Vision as evidence for the Godhead being three separate beings.

William Smith, a younger brother of Smith, and a key figure in the early Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church, renamed the Community of Christ in 2001), gave several accounts of the First Vision, although in 1883 he stated that a &quot;more elaborate and accurate description of his vision&quot; was to be found in Smith&#x27;s own history.

The RLDS Church did not emphasize the First Vision during the 19th century. In the early-20th century, there was a revival of interest, and during most of the century, the First Vision was viewed as an essential element of the Restoration. In many cases, it was taught as the foundation and even the embodiment of the Restoration. The vision was also interpreted as a justification for the exclusive authority of the RLDS Church as the Church of Christ.

In the mid- to late-20th century, writers within the RLDS Church emphasized the First Vision as an illustration of the centrality of Jesus. The church began taking a broader view of the vision, and used it as an example of how God evolves the church over time through revelation and restoration. There was less emphasis on the Great Apostasy and a growing belief that the First Vision itself was not necessarily identical with Smith&#x27;s later reconstructions and interpretations of the vision, what one RLDS Church Historian has called &quot;genuine historical sophistication.&quot; In 1980, this Church Historian noted that he had &quot;systematically brought to the attention&quot; of hundreds of church members &quot;the substantive differences in half a dozen accounts of the First Vision&quot; and expressed his satisfaction that RLDS scholars, &quot;deeply moved and augmented by the presence of the wondrously diverse and conflicting accounts of the First Vision,&quot; could &quot;begin the exciting work of developing a mythology of Latter Day Saint beginnings.&quot;

===View of The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)===
The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), a Rigdonite branch with 15,000 members headquartered in Pennsylvania, has had an independent history since the 1844 succession crisis. The church refers to the vision obliquely in a lengthy excerpt from Smith&#x27;s 1842 account included in its official literature, in which the date &quot;1820&quot; and &quot;a personage&quot; (singular, not plural) are mentioned in paraphrases.

===Church of Christ (Temple Lot)===
The Church of Christ (Temple Lot), a branch with 7,000 adherents, rejects many of Smith&#x27;s post-1832 revelations. Nevertheless, the church uses several elements of the 1842 account of the First Vision, including Smith&#x27;s desire to know which church he should join, his reading of James 1:5, his prayer in the grove, the appearance of God the Father and Jesus Christ, the statement by Jesus that all existing churches were corrupt, and the instruction that Smith should join none of them.

===Criticism and response===
Writing of the &quot;unusual excitement on the subject of religion&quot; described in the First Vision story canonized by the LDS Church, Milton V. Backman said that although &quot;the tools of the historian&quot; could neither verify nor challenge the First Vision, &quot;records of the past can be examined to determine the reliability of Joseph&#x27;s description regarding the historical setting.&quot; Grant Palmer and other critics claim that there are serious discrepancies between the various accounts, as well as anachronisms revealed by lack of contemporary corroboration. Other critics, like Fawn Brodie and Jerald and Sandra Tanner, argue that the Smith&#x27;s accounts are not unique and not much different from similar visions and accounts being reported by others, such as Elias Smith and Asa Wild, around the same time.

Leaders of the LDS Church have acknowledged that the First Vision as well as the Book of Mormon and Smith himself constitute &quot;stumbling blocks for many.&quot; Apostle Neal A. Maxwell wrote:
In our own time, Joseph Smith, the First Vision, and the Book of Mormon constitute stumbling blocks for many—around which they cannot get—unless they are meek enough to examine all the evidence at hand, not being exclusionary as a result of accumulated attitudes in a secular society. Humbleness of mind is the initiator of expansiveness of mind.

In a 2007 PBS documentary, Richard Mouw, an evangelical theologian and student of Mormonism, summarized his feelings about the First Vision:
My instinct is to attribute a sincerity to Joseph Smith. And yet at the same time, as an evangelical Christian, I do not believe that the members of the godhead really appeared to him and told him that he should start on a mission of, among other things, denouncing the kinds of things that I believe as a Presbyterian. I can&#x27;t believe that. And yet at the same time, I really don&#x27;t believe that he was simply making up a story that he knew to be false in order to manipulate people and to gain power over a religious movement. And so I live with the mystery.

<text>Ribeirão Preto (Portuguese pronunciation: ) is a municipality and a metropolitan area located in the northeastern region of São Paulo state, Brazil.

Ribeirão Preto is the eighth-largest municipality in the State with . It has an estimated population of 720,216 in 2021 and a metropolitan area of 1,178,910. It is located from the city of São Paulo and from Brasília, the federal capital. Its mean altitude is high. The city&#x27;s average temperature throughout the year is , and the original predominant vegetation is the Atlantic Forest.

The city originated around 1856 as an agricultural region. Coffee was a primary income source until 1929 when it lost value when compared with the industrial sector. In the second half of the 20th century, investment in health, biotechnology, bioenergy, and information technology led to the city being declared a Technological Center in 2010. These activities have caused the city to have the 30th biggest gross national (GNP) in Brazil.

The city is also an important cultural center. The Mayor Luiz Roberto Jábali Park, the Maurilio Biagi Park, Carlos Raya Park, Santa Tereza Reserve, and the Zoo are important preservation areas. Pinguim Beerhouse, Dom Pedro Theatre, and projects such as Ribeirão Preto&#x27;s Cinema Center are relevant sightseeing points, along with events such as the Agrishow Agricultural Fair, Tanabata Festival, Joao Rock Music Festival, and the National Outdoor Book Fair.

== History ==
The municipality was founded June 19, 1856, being populated initially by farmers and African slaves coming from other areas of São Paulo (especially from Mogi Mirim and São Simão) and Minas Gerais looking for land with good pastures. The city was built by a stream called Black Creek and was named after it (&quot;Ribeirão Preto&quot; means black creek in Portuguese, sometimes translated as &quot;Black Stream&quot;). The fertile soil of Ribeirão Preto region allowed a high crop productivity.

Initially the main rural activities were pastures, cattle and subsistence agriculture. In the 1870s, the coffee crop arrived to Ribeirão Preto. The rapid development of coffee cultivation brought wealth and progress to the city, which by the 1880s had become the largest coffee producer in the world. Coffee, also called &quot;green gold&quot;, caused a &quot;gold rush&quot; in the region, which attracted workers and adventurous people from many parts of the world. This movement was helped by the new Mogiana Railway, linking Ribeirão Preto to São Paulo and to the port city of Santos, and by the abolition of slavery in Brazil, in 1888. The end of slavery created a strong market for labor, and &quot;coffee barons&quot;, as coffee farmers were called, also stimulated immigration. Immigrants coming from Europe (mostly Italy, but also from Portugal, Spain and Germany) and from Japan have settled in coffee farms of Ribeirão Preto and neighboring towns. Some of the immigrants, especially the Italians, were settled at the &quot;Núcleo Colonial Antonio Prado&quot; (Antonio Prado Colonial Nucleus) which was created by the government in 1887. This nucleus originated many of the northern and eastern districts of Ribeirão Preto. Later, after the stock market crash of 1929, some of the immigrants bought the farms from their impoverished former employers.

== Demography ==
Adding to the Native Amerindians already living in the area when migrants began to occupy and settle the land, the population of Ribeirão Preto includes, amongst other groups, descendants of Africans, Italians, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Germans, Lebanese immigrants who were attracted to the region, after the abolition of slavery in 1888, when immigrants were granted lands, after being indentured workers. Descendants of enslaved African people constitute a big and important element of the population. Italians also arrived in huge number.

During the 1990s, Northeastern migrants came to the region attracted by São Paulo state cities&#x27; economic development, which was widely broadcast in TV documentaries. With the city&#x27;s super population by individuals who often had no technical skills and were often illiterate, poverty and crime grew considerably. Many migrants boosted the economy by working in sugar cane plantations and orange groves, though. However, those who perform seasonal duties often have no safety net when the work is over. IBGE estimative (2020) indicates that Ribeirão Preto has a population of 711,825 inhabitants. The urban agglomeration incorporates 34 municipalities, with a population of about 1.4 million inhabitants.

== Tourism, culture and events==
At the beginning of the 20th century and during its first three decades, Ribeirão Preto was a rich city, boasting several mansions, European-style cafés, cabarets and even two opera houses, as result of the coffee economy. One of the opera houses – the &quot;Carlos Gomes Theatre&quot; (in honour of Brazilian opera composer Carlos Gomes) – was demolished in 1949, but the other – the &quot;Pedro II Theatre&quot; (named in honor of Emperor Dom Pedro II), dating from the 1920s – resisted time and was restored and modernized during the 1990s. Its ceiling, completely destroyed in a fire of 1980, was rebuilt and gained a new design projected by Japanese-Brazilian artist Tomie Ohtake. The Pedro II Theatre is now the third largest opera house in Brazil and is the home of the Ribeirão Preto symphony orchestra, one of the oldest and most important in Brazil.

Several events take place in Ribeirão Preto, many of which occur annually, such as the Agrishow (an international fair of agricultural technology), Fair Photo Image, Film Festival Ribeirão Preto, National Book Fair of Ribeirão Preto, Festival Tanabata (Japanese cultural festival), Festitália (Italian cultural festival), João Rock Music Fest, Ribeirão Rodeo Music, Bonfim Paulista Rodeo Show, Ribeirão Skol Folia, Fair ExpoHair, Feitrans (Fair Transport Interior Paulista), Arena Cross, Entorta Bixo, Ribeirão Cana Invest, Expobonsai, AVIRRP, Comida di Buteco, Restaurant Week Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto Tropeada, Mitsubishi Rally Cup, Copa Chevrolet Montana, and others. These events move various segments of the municipality, as the airport, bus system, taxi, hotel chain, bars, restaurants, and more.

The municipality has a hot climate, which makes people go out in the evening to chat and enjoy cold draft beers in bars.

== Sports ==

The municipality possesses two soccer stadiums, the Estádio Palma Travassos (of Comercial FC) and Santa Cruz (of Botafogo FC). Botafogo FC is currently competing in Campeonato Brasileiro Série B and Campeonato Paulista, whereas Comercial FC is currently competing in Campeonato Paulista Série A3. On the national and international scene, Botafogo is often confused with the Rio de Janeiro club with the same name to the extent that the Rio club is often credited with being the infamous club against which Pelé scored a record 8 goals in one game. One example is in Franklin Foer&#x27;s book &quot;How Soccer Explains the World&quot;. But it was in the Paulista championships on November 21, 1964, in the coastal city of Santos and against the Ribeirão Preto&#x27;s team that Pelé achieved the incredible feat and his Santos team won by an 11 × 0 score. The 8 goals were payback for the defeat Santos suffered on September 6, 1964, when they visited Ribeirão Preto during the first round of the tournament and lost 2 x 0. Not only had a &quot;small&quot; team beaten one of the &quot;big&quot; teams, but had done so while insulting the &quot;King&quot;. A better claim to fame for Botafogo (often referred to as Botafogo-SP) is that Brazilian soccer captains (and brothers) Sócrates and Raí started their careers with Botafogo.

In 2017 a men&#x27;s volleyball team was founded in Ribeirão Preto, Vôlei Ribeirão, which was champion of Superliga Brasileira B in 2018, and competed in Superliga Brasileira, the major volleyball league in Brazil, from 2019 to 2021.

== Economy ==

After the New York Stock Exchange crash of 1929 the economy of Ribeirão Preto, based on a single export crop, collapsed, and the city had to adapt to a new situation. Since the city is relatively far from other major Brazilian urban centers, it found a new economic vocation in the services and commercial sector, which was developed to attend the local and regional demands.

The second economic boom in the history of Ribeirão Preto occurred after the oil crisis (1973 and 1979) of the 1970s. The increase in the oil price obliged Brazil to look for alternative means of fueling and the solution found was the alcohol fuel program, or &quot;Pro-Álcool&quot; as it is called. Pró-Álcool led to the development of a technology which allows the use of ethanol (sugarcane alcohol) either as automotive fuel or as a gasoline additive. The latter improves performance and substitutes lead thus decreasing polluting emissions. Due to the Pró-Álcool program, farmers from the region of Ribeirão Preto were encouraged by government subsidies to grow sugarcane. The high productivity of the land around Ribeirão Preto rapidly placed the region as the largest alcohol and sugar producer of the world, being responsible for 30 percent of Brazil&#x27;s sugarcane alcohol fuel.

The sugarcane boom brought a new age of prosperity for the city, which was called the &quot;Brazilian California&quot; during the 1980s and early 1990s. On the one hand, this has increased the city&#x27;s wealth and turned it into a sophisticated centre of services for Brazil and South America but, on the other hand, the image of a new &quot;Eldorado&quot; attracted many migrants from impoverished areas of Brazil leading to a rapid population growth and the appearance of slums (&quot;favelas&quot; as they are called in Brazil).

Nowadays, the sugarcane is the major crop produced in the rural area of the municipality, followed by minor crops such as pastures, maize, peanut and soybean. Ribeirão Preto&#x27;s major manufactures are: medical materials, dental materials, animal feed, meat, dairy products, textiles, steel, furniture, building materials, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and, of course, beer. The city hosts &quot;Agrishow&quot; on an annual basis, this show is one of the most important agricultural trade shows in Brazil.

During the economic stagnation from the 1940s to the 1950s the city discovered and established its vocation as an educational and university center. In 1942 the state government expropriated the Monte Alegre Farm, an important coffee farm from the Schmidt family of German immigrants, and transformed it into an agricultural practical school. Several new buildings and houses for the professors were constructed on a land which held before tens of thousands of coffee plants. The new school was very well planned and urbanized and many trees were planted to provide shadow and give it a pleasant atmosphere. But the agricultural school never achieved a significant development and it was closed in 1951. A longstanding dream of the population of Ribeirão Preto was to have a university and in 1952 the old farm was donated to the University of São Paulo for the creation of a medical school, which was the first school of its campus at Ribeirão Preto.

Fortunately, many original buildings of the agricultural school and even some of the Monte Alegre Farm were preserved and only adapted to hold the new university, which makes its campus one of the most beautiful university campuses in Brazil. After the creation of the medical school the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto (USP-RP) has been growing steadily and it is presently constituted by eight schools: School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto (FMRP), School of Law of Ribeirão Preto (FDRP), School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters (FFCLRP), School of Dentistry (FORP), School of Economics, Administration and Accounting (FEARP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFRP), School of Nursing (EERP) and School of Music (DMRP-ECA).

The creation of USP-RP stimulated the cultural and academic life in Ribeirão Preto and several schools, colleges and universities were opened in the city since then. The municipality has also many private colleges such as: Centro Universitário Barão da Mauá, Centro Universitário Moura Lacerda, Centro Universitário Estácio, Faculdade Anhanguera, Faculdade Reges, Faculdade São Luís, Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP), Universidade Paulista (UNIP), Universidade de Ribeirão Preto (UNAERP).

<text>Danbury is a village in the City of Chelmsford district, in the county of Essex, England. It is located northeast of Charing Cross, London and has a population of approximately 6,500. It is situated on a hill above sea level.

The city of Danbury, Connecticut in the United States is named after the village.

==Origins==
The village was built on the site of a Neolithic or early Iron Age hill fort noted for its oval shape, sometimes confused with the Megalithic enclosure at Danebury in Hampshire.

According to the official parish publication, &quot;Danbury Parish Plan 2003&quot;, first Iron Age settlers, then the Romans and finally the Dæningas tribe of Saxons occupied the Danbury area.

The place-name &#x27;Danbury&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Danengeberia&quot; in the hundred of Chelmsford. The name means &#x27;the burgh or fort of Dene&#x27;s people&#x27;. The same name is the origin of the name of the village and peninsula of Dengie in Essex.

After the Norman Conquest, King William the Conqueror took the lands and settlement and granted it to Geoffrey de Mandeville, who was made Earl of Essex.

==Medieval to Georgian period==
In medieval times Danbury developed from two manors, St Cleres/Herons and Runsell. Traces of both still exist. There was also a small part of a third, now extinct, manor of Gibcracks. The church of St John the Baptist is the oldest building in the village, dating from the 13th century, and is grade I listed. There is a local folk tale that the church&#x27;s spire was damaged by the Devil in the guise of a monk in the year 1402. According to the legend, the Devil passed between the legs of a parishioner as he departed, and the man later died of a wasting disease.

The village has a long connection with the Sinclair family, known locally as St Clere. There are three wooden effigies in the church which date back to the thirteenth and fourteenth century One has been identified as being that of William St Clere. In 1968 it was taken to be exhibited at the Louvre in Paris.

In 1779 the tomb of a knight was disturbed, and the body therein was discovered to be perfectly preserved in what was described as &quot;pickle&quot;, but this was contested by Joseph Strutt, Member of Parliament (MP) for Maldon. Strutt also attempted to write a romance with a book called &quot;Queenhoo Hall&quot;. In 1808, Sir Walter Scott was asked to complete the book by his publisher John Murray. Scott visited the village and stayed at the Griffin Inn in order to attempt his first venture into romantic fiction.

==Victorian period==
The Church had fallen into some decay by the early 19th century when efforts were made to repair it. A much more significant restoration began in 1866 when George Gilbert Scott was engaged for the project. The Church was closed for over a year and seating capacity was increased from 434 to 569. The pews today still include at least 3 medieval ones. Many pews feature distinctive poppy heads.

The church also contains some memorial slabs to the Mildmays. Sir Walter Mildmay was the founder of Emmanuel College, Cambridge and built Danbury Place in 1589. The original building has disappeared but another was built in 1832 in the Tudor Revival style, with red brick. It was acquired by the Church of England in 1845 and became a residence of the Bishop of Rochester, known as Danbury Palace, until 1892. Subsequently the house was in private hands, used as a maternity home during the 1939–45 War, acquired by the local authority as a college and then disposed of to developers. The house has now been converted into apartments.

The mansion sits within the historic landscape of Danbury Country Park, a former medieval deer park, with later additions dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. It is now owned by Essex County Council and has been adapted for youth activities by Essex Outdoors. The history of the park and garden was researched by Kate Felus in 2007.

==Modern day==
The village is at the centre of extensive areas of woodland and heath owned by the National Trust and other conservation organisations. Danbury Common, a Site of Special Scientific Interest lies due south of the village centre. The woodlands extend into the parish of Little Baddow. However the quietude of the surrounding countryside contrasts with the A414 road, a major trunk route running through the village centre linking it with Maldon to the east and Chelmsford to the west. Several bus services running from Chelmsford link Danbury with Maldon, Great Baddow, Little Baddow, South Woodham Ferrers, Sandon and other villages around Maldon.

Danbury has its own community magazine called The Focus, which is also delivered to Bicknacre and Little Baddow.

==Geodesy==
Danbury Church Spire was the origin (meridian) for the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. Originally it also was the origin for Essex, but that county was recalculated on the meridian of St. Paul&#x27;s, London, in about 1919, due to the fact that Greater London started to spill out well into Essex.

==Education==
There are several primary schools in Danbury but no secondary schools. The primary schools are: Danbury Park Community Primary School, St. John&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, Heathcote Preparatory School and Elm Green Preparatory School.

<text>Richard Edwin Stearns (born July 5, 1936) is an American computer scientist who, with Juris Hartmanis, received the 1993 ACM Turing Award &quot;in recognition of their seminal paper which established the foundations for the field of computational complexity theory&quot;. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.

Stearns graduated with a B.A. in mathematics from Carleton College in 1958. He then received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1961 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;Three person cooperative games without side payments&quot;, under the supervision of Harold W. Kuhn. Stearns is now Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at the University at Albany, which is part of the State University of New York.

== Bibliography ==
*. A first systematic study of language operations that preserve regular languages.
* . Contains the time hierarchy theorem, one of the theorems that shaped the field of computational complexity theory.
*. Answers a basic question about deterministic pushdown automata: it is decidable whether a given deterministic pushdown automaton accepts a regular language.
*. Introduces LL parsers, which play an important role in compiler design.

<doc id="307510" wikidata="Q3090947" url="?curid=307510" title="Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome">
<text>Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome is the sixth studio album by the American funk band Parliament, released in 1977.

It is a loose concept album warning the listener of falling into the &quot;Placebo Syndrome,&quot; which according to George Clinton is consumerism, and listening to disco music, which he saw as a simplification of funk music in attempt to gain commercial success. The album spawned the R&amp;B number No. 1 single in &quot;Flash Light&quot;, which features a funky synthesizer bass line played on a Minimoog by keyboardist Bernie Worrell. The album became Parliament&#x27;s fourth consecutive gold album and second platinum album. The song &quot;Sir Nose d&#x27;Voidoffunk (Pay Attention – B3M)&quot; contains nursery rhymes &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot; and &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;; the lyrics were changed to refer to drug use.

The original vinyl release contained a 22″×33″ poster of the character Sir Nose D&#x27;Voidoffunk, as well as an 8-page comic book that explains the concept behind the LP. Both the poster and the comic book were illustrated by Overton Loyd.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; praised the &quot;superb&quot; backing vocals of the Brides of Funkenstein. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the music is typical P-Funk bouncing disco, lively and toe-tapping, with gabbling spoken and sung vocals on top.&quot;

<text>Maldon (, locally ) is a town and civil parish on the Blackwater estuary in Essex, England. It is the seat of the Maldon District and starting point of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. It is known for Maldon Sea Salt which is produced in the area. In 2011 the parish had a population of 14,220 and the district had a population of 61,700.
==History==
===Early and medieval history===
The place-name &quot;Maldon&quot; is first attested in 913 in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, where it appears as &quot;Maeldun&quot;. Maldon&#x27;s name comes from &quot;mǣl&quot; meaning &#x27;monument or cross&#x27; and &quot;dūn&quot; meaning &#x27;hill&#x27;, so translates as &#x27;monument hill&#x27;. East Saxons settled the area in the 5th century and the area to the south is still known as the Dengie Peninsula after the Dæningas. It became a significant Saxon port with a hythe or quayside and artisan quarters. Evidence of imported pottery from this period has been found in archaeological digs. From 958 there was a royal mint issuing coins for the late Anglo-Saxon and early Norman kings.
It was one of the only two towns in Essex (Colchester was the other), and King Edward the Elder is thought to have lived here while combating the Danish settlers who had overrun North Essex and parts of East Anglia. A Viking raid was beaten off in 924, but in another raid in 991 the defenders were defeated in the Battle of Maldon and the Vikings received tribute but apparently did not attempt to sack the town. It became the subject of the celebrated Old English poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;. The battle is commemorated by a window in St Mary&#x27;s Church and by a statue at the end of the Maldon Promenade Walk (facing the battle site of Northey Island and the Causeway) of the slain Saxon warrior Byrhtnoth.

According to the Domesday Book of 1086, there were 54 households and an estimated 180 townsmen in 1086. The town still had the mint and supplied a warhorse and warship for the king&#x27;s service in return for its privileges of self-government. The town was awarded a charter by Henry II in 1171, stating the rights of the town as well as defining its borders and detailing its duty to provide a ship for the monarch &quot;when necessary&quot;. The town&#x27;s All Saints&#x27; Church, unique in England in having a triangular tower, dates from around this period. While the precise building date is unknown, the church existed by 1180, the date of the foundation of nearby Beeleigh Abbey. A Charter of Richard I of December 1189 confirms &quot;certain grants to Beeleigh Abbey, including the Church of Blessed Peter in Maldon and the Church of All Saints&#x27; in the same town&quot;. St Mary&#x27;s Church, on the Hythe Quay has a grade I listed Norman nave from 1130, though evidence exists of an earlier church on the site from at least a hundred years before. Meanwhile, Maldon Moot Hall dates back to around 1420.

===Renaissance and modern eras===
There were strong urban traditions, with two members elected to the Commons and three guilds which hosted lavish religious plays until they were suppressed by Puritans in 1576. Then, until 1630, professional actors were invited to perform plays, which were also stopped by Puritans. From 1570 to about 1800 a rival tradition of inviting prominent clergy to visit the town also existed. In 1629 a series of grain riots took place, led by the wife of a local butcher.
In the 17th century Thomas Plume started the Plume Library to house over 8,000 books and pamphlets printed between 1487 and his death in 1704; the collection has been added to at various times since 1704. The Plume Library is to be found at St Peter&#x27;s Church. Only the original tower survives, the rest of the building having been rebuilt by Thomas Plume to house his library (on the first floor) and what was Maldon Grammar School (on the ground floor).

In the church of All Saints is a memorial window to George Washington, whose great-great grandfather, Lawrence Washington, is buried here. Unveiled by an American diplomat on 5 July 1928, the window displays Saint Nicholas with the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, Saint George and Saint Joan of Arc in the centre. At the top are the arms of the Washington family, and the arms of the USA, England, Scotland and Wales. At the bottom are depictions of George Washington, the landing of the Mayflower, the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Statue of Liberty.

Also in Maldon are Maldon Baptist Church in Butt Lane, Maldon Methodist Church in the High Street, and Maldon United Reformed Church on Market Hill. Maldon Mosque is in Church Street.

During World War II, Maldon was featured in the German invasion plan for Britain, Operation Sea Lion. The plan called for the Germans to advance to a line between Maldon and the River Severn after they had landed in the southern coast of England.

==Geography and geology==

Maldon is on the tidal River Chelmer by the Blackwater Estuary. It is on the A414 east of Chelmsford and north-east of Charing Cross, London, via the A13 road.

Essex is a county built on London Clay, overlain with pockets of gravel deposited by riparian action; the lowest land is made up of river alluvium and salt marsh. At Maldon, the railway cutting (now a road cutting) provided a reference section for geologists. There are three landslips on the north-facing river cliff of the Blackwater at Maldon. The middle slip is called the West Maldon Landslip, which was caused by repeated rotational slips of the bedrock London Clay, which is trying to reach a stable angle.

Hythe Quay at the confluence of the Chelmer and Blackwater, which flanks the northern edge of the town, was an important port and Cooks Yard remains significant for Thames barges. The River Blackwater, that was diverted into the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation, re-emerges into the Blackwater Estuary, through locks at the Heybridge Basin, the stream bed passes down Heybridge Creek. Here it delineates the border between Maldon Town and Heybridge Parish Council.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Maldon was previously served by two railway lines. Today, the nearest railway stations to Maldon are Hatfield Peverel, Witham and North Fambridge. Hatfield Peverel is the closest railway station to the north of the town, whilst North Fambridge is closest to southern parts of the town.

Maldon&#x27;s first railway link was a branch line to Witham opened in 1846. Later, a second line linked Maldon with Woodham Ferrers on the Crouch Valley line between Southminster and Wickford. Whilst Wickford is itself on the line between Shenfield and Southend (thus providing Maldon with another route into London Liverpool Street), a short-lived spur line at Wickford also gave direct access towards Southend.

Edward Arthur Fitch, writing in about 1895, states that from London&#x27;s Liverpool Street station to Maldon East via Witham there were eight trains on weekdays and three on Sundays and that, via Wickford, there were five trains on weekdays and none on Sundays. The fastest train took 85 minutes via Witham and 82 minutes via Wickford.

Maldon West railway station was opened in 1889 by the Great Eastern Railway. The line between Maldon and South Woodham Ferrers closed to passengers in 1939, the Maldon and Witham line closed in 1966.

===Bus===
Regular bus services in and around the town are operated primarily by First Essex and Hedingham; key routes include the 31 from Chelmsford, the 75 from Colchester and the 90 from Witham.

==Industry==
Maldon Sea Salt has been produced in the town since 1882 by the Maldon Crystal Salt Company; it is also the location of the first Tesco store to be designated as a &quot;supermarket&quot; in the country, established in 1958.

Maldon&#x27;s Hythe Quay is the residence of a number of Thames sailing barges, these are among the last cargo vessels in the world still operating under sail, albeit now used for education and leisure. Some ten to fifteen of the surviving fleet count Maldon as their home port, and many others are regular visitors alongside at the Quay. An annual sailing barge race ends with a parade of sail and prize-giving at the quay. Cooks Yard, where barges were once built, is still working at the end of Maldon Quay.

==Culture==
The town holds the charitable Maldon mud race where competitors race across the Blackwater estuary at low tide, along the bank and back through the water. The race generated over £55,000 for charities in 2014. Maldon also hosts the international Maldon Festival, which takes place each year in late June and July.

The town holds an annual &quot;Taxi Day&quot; which sees mentally and physically disabled children from London driven to Maldon in London Black Cabs for a fun day of activities and a meal. The event dates back to 1952 when a London cab driver visited the Elizabeth Fry Special School (formerly Grange Road Special School) in Plaistow. He wanted to do something special for the young patients he saw there. He wrote to every one of Essex&#x27;s seaside towns to arrange an outing and the only town that was willing to help was Maldon; thus, Taxi Day has remained a tradition ever since.

Maldon is twinned with the Dutch town of Cuijk. The charter between the two towns was signed in 1970 to cement the relationship.

===Cultural references===

Maldon and the surrounding area are the setting for a series of books by the prolific author S. L. Bensusan. Bensusan&#x27;s stories recall a lost way of life among the towns and villages in the area, and along the local coastline and marshland. In Bensusan&#x27;s books, Maldon is called Market Waldron.

Maldon has been the setting for numerous television productions, including &quot;Lawless Heart&quot; (2001) starring Bill Nighy, and BBC1&#x27;s &quot;The Murder Game&quot; (2003) where numerous Blackwater Estuary locations were used including Green&#x27;s Flour Mill at the bottom of Market Hill and Steeple Marshes. An episode of the TV series &quot;Lovejoy&quot; featuring Ian McShane was also filmed there.

There are many developed youth football teams in Maldon, among them being Maldon Saints. The town has a vibrant cricket club, with several adult and colts&#x27; sides, who play at two grounds: The Promenade Park, Maldon and the main ground at Drapers Farm, Heybridge. Recent improvements to the ground include a dual-lane enclosed all-weather net facility. Overseas players from Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka have coached cricket in local primary schools as part of the &quot;ECB Chance to Shine&quot; programme. Drapers Farm is also the home of Maldon Rugby Union Football Club which was founded in 1947 by Tommy Harries, who was the landlord of the King&#x27;s Head public house in Maldon High Street. The inaugural meeting was on 28 August 1947 at the Blue Boar Hotel. Maldon RFC run several senior male sides and one female side as well as all youth age groups from under 7s to under 18s.

Two short lived greyhound racing tracks existed at Sealey Farm on the Fambridge Road (opening on 3 September 1932 and closing the same year) and around the former Spital Road football ground in 1931. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and they were known as flapping tracks, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.

<text>Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu (4 November 193326 November 2011) was a Nigerian military officer and political figure who served as President of Biafra from 1967 to 1970. As the military governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, which he declared as the independent state of Biafra, Ojukwu led the Biafran forces during the Nigerian Civil War against the Nigerian government forces.

Born in Zungeru, British Nigeria to Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu, a wealthy Igbo businessman, Ojukwu was educated at King&#x27;s College, Lagos and Epsom College in Surrey, England. He proceeded to Lincoln College, Oxford University where he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in Modern History in 1955. He returned to Nigeria to serve as an administrative officer and would later join the Nigerian army. Following the independence of Nigeria in 1960, a group of military officers overthrew Nigeria’s civilian government in the 1966 Nigerian coup d&#x27;état and Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi became the head of state. Ironsi appointed Ojukwu as military governor of the Eastern Region mostly dominated by the Igbo tribe.

In response to Igbo demands for secession, Ojukwu reorganised the Eastern Region as the Republic of Biafra, and he declared independence from Nigeria. Nigeria invaded Biafra, sparking the Nigerian Civil War. The Nigerian military, with support from the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, blockaded Biafra and cut food supplies, which created a mass famine. Ojukwu made use of foreign media to highlight the plight of Biafran civilians and depict the war as genocide against Igbos. The shocking images of starving Biafran civilians turned the war into an international media sensation, as this was one of the first globally televised wars alongside the Vietnam War. Biafra received international humanitarian relief during the Biafran airlift. 

Biafra eventually capitulated to Nigerian forces in 1970 after millions of Biafran civilians died. Ojukwu subsequently fled to Ivory Coast in exile, where President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who recognised Biafra as a sovereign and independent state, granted him political asylum. In 1981, newly democratically elected Nigerian president Shehu Shagari granted amnesty to Ojukwu, allowing him to return to Nigeria without facing political or legal consequences from the war. Ojukwu spent the remainder of his life unsuccessfully attempting to return to Nigerian politics as a democratically elected politician rather than a military ruler. 

He died in 2011 at the age of 78 in London, England. His body was returned to Nigeria, where Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan arranged a state funeral. He was buried with full military honours, including a 21-gun salute from the Nigerian Army, and thousands of people attended his funeral. Ojukwu remains a contentious figure in the history of Nigeria. Many Igbo people regard him as a hero and a messianic figure who did what was necessary to ensure the survival of Nigeria&#x27;s Eastern population while facing the possibility of a genocide after the 1966 coup. Other Nigerians have deemed Biafra&#x27;s secession unnecessary, blaming Ojukwu for the events of the war and accusing him of oppressing Biafra&#x27;s non-Igbo ethnic minorities.

==Early life and education==
Ojukwu was born as the second son of Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu. Loius is the son of a clan chief from Nnewi, Anambra State. Louis married at the age of twenty five to a young wife and after a short union, they separated. Before then, the wife lived at Zungeru, a village in Northern Nigeria. After the birth of Ojukwu in November 1933, Louis visited from Lagos and reclaimed Chukwuemeka, his given name.

The World War II broke out when Ojukwu was seven. His father sent him to St. Patrick&#x27;s School and CMS Grammar School both in Lagos. In 1944 at the age of 10, Ojukwu started studying at King&#x27;s College, Lagos. In 1945 when Ojukwu has stayed for two years in Kings, his father, who want him to be educated in England, made consultations from his English friend. Epsom College in Surrey was recommended and by 1946 Loius sent Ojukwu there for an advanced education. Ojukwu stayed at Epsom for six years. During that time, he excelled in academics as well as in sports and athletics. He played rugby for the college winning the spring javelin throwing and discus. At 18 he entered Lincoln College, Oxford and studied briefly in 1952. Loius wanted his son to be a lawyer as it was the most common in Nigeria but Ojukwu wants to read modern history. Between 1952 and 1955 he studied law and later switched to history. He also joined the West African Students&#x27; Union in Oxford. During his final years, he joined Oxford Rugby Union as wing three quarter in Lincoln College&#x27;s team. Ojukwu graduated with a B.A in arts in 1955 and travelled back to Lagos. He would later return to Oxford to obtain his M.A.

==Early career==
After informing his reluctant parents, Ojukwu joined the Nigerian Civil Service in Udi, as an Assistant District Officer. He was posted to the East since local authorities mandated all young civil administrators to serve in the Eastern Region. He hardly spoke Igbo since he was born in the north, raised in the west, and educated in England, hence, he could speak English and Yoruba fluently, and satisfactory Hausa. Ojukwu started learning Igbo in order to communicate with the people. Throughout his stay in Udi and other later postings in Umuahia and Aba from 1955-57, he stayed with people living in bushes. From Aba, he was posted to Calabar. His father, 
believing the superstition that Efik women casts spell and bewitches young men, he called his friend, the then Governor-general, John Stuart Macpherson, to terminate the appointment, and he did.

Ojukwu became angry about the termination, and he then applied to join the Nigerian Army in 1957. His reason was to escape the influence of his father over his chosen career. The Nigerian army was regarded as a small administration that people who held commissioned offices had their last degree from primary school. Seeing Ojukwu apply to join the military, surprised the Governor-general, high Army Commands, and his father. Loius, through Macpherson, ensured that Ojukwu is denied officer cadetship, hence he would not enter as a private soldier, which is more difficult but Ojukwu still Joined as a private soldier at the Army Recruit Depot in Zaria. During a recruit training by Sergeant Moussa Fort-Lamy, Ojukwu corrected his English speaking errors. Surprised by that, he sent Ojukwu to be interviewed by the Depot commander and subsequently apply for an officer commission-cadetship. It took a month for the paper to be out and during the waiting, Ojukwu was assigned the duty of escorting the wife and daughter of the Colonel in their horse ride and tennis parties.

The application was successful, and from Zaria, Ojukwu first moved to Teshie in Ghana and then to Officer Cadet School in Eaton Hall, England in February 1958. After a six months course, Ojukwu became a Second Lieutenant and before returning to Nigeria in November, he visited Infantry School, Warminster and Small Arms School, Hythe. In Nigeria, Ojukwu was posted to the 5th Battalion in Kaduna. He was sent to Ghana&#x27;s Teshie Frontal School in 1959, to teach infantry tactics, and one of his student was Murtala Muhammed. From Teshie, he taught military law at the Ghana Academy. A British Brigadier, who was on a visit to Nigeria, requested that Ojukwu return as his staff in the brigade at Apapa. The Nigerian Army at Central Lagos disputed the request and asked Ojukwu to report to the headquarters in January 1961. Ojukwu returned to Nigeria to witness the 1960 Nigerian Independence but returned to Ghana to finish his work. He returned again to Nigeria before Christmas in 1960 and saw he 
was already promoted to the rank of a Captain. From January 1961 to mid 1961, he worked as a staff of branch A of the new Nigerian army headquarters located within the building of the Defense ministry in Lagos. After the independence, many British army officers were removed and there were more space for new administration. It was six months of Ojukwu&#x27;s captaincy when he was promoted to the rank of a Major in the summer of 1961.

Shortly after his promotion, Ojukwu was sent to Kaduna as a staff officer of the 1st Brigade. Zaire also had independence in 1960 and had begun to break into Katanga, a rich in minerals province. At the end of 1961, the 1st Brigade were sent there and took over the works of the United Nations (UN) forces at Luluaboury. Ojukwu served as the Adjutant to the British commander, Brigadier Mackenzie. The British Government informed Lagos about the remaining single vacancy of one Nigerian officer to attend the Joint Service Command and Staff College (JSSC) course in 1962.

==1966 coups and events leading to the Nigerian Civil War==
Lieutenant-Colonel Ojukwu was in Kano, northern Nigeria, when Major Patrick Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu on 15 January 1966 executed and announced the bloody military coup in Kaduna, also in northern Nigeria. It is to Ojukwu&#x27;s credit that the coup lost much steam in the north, where it had succeeded. Lt. Col. Odumegwu-Ojukwu supported the forces loyal to the Supreme Commander of the Nigerian Armed Forces, Major-General Aguiyi-Ironsi. Major Nzeogwu was in control of Kaduna, but the coup had failed in other parts of the country.

Aguiyi-Ironsi took over the leadership of the country and thus became the first military head of state. On Monday, 17 January 1966, he appointed military governors for the four regions. Lt. Col. Odumegwu-Ojukwu was appointed Military Governor of the Eastern Region. Others were: Lt.-Cols Hassan Usman Katsina (North), Francis Adekunle Fajuyi (West), and David Akpode Ejoor (Mid West). These men formed the Supreme Military Council with Brigadier B.A.O. Ogundipe, Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters, Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon, Chief of Staff Army HQ, Commodore J. E. A. Wey, Head of Nigerian Navy, Lt. Col. George T. Kurubo, Head of Air Force, Col. Sittu Alao.

By 29 May, the 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom started. This presented problems for Odumegwu Ojukwu, as he did everything in his power to prevent reprisals and even encouraged people to return, as assurances for their safety had been given by his supposed colleagues up north and out west.

On 29 July 1966, a group of officers, including Majors Murtala Muhammed, Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma, and Martin Adamu, led the majority of Northern soldiers in a mutiny that later developed into a &quot;Counter-Coup&quot; or &quot;July Rematch&quot;. The coup failed in the South-Eastern part of Nigeria where Ojukwu was the military Governor, due to the effort of the brigade commander and hesitation of northern officers stationed in the region (partly due to the mutiny leaders in the East being Northern whilst being surrounded by a large Eastern population).

The Supreme Commander General Aguiyi-Ironsi and his host Colonel Fajuyi were abducted and killed in Ibadan. On acknowledging Ironsi&#x27;s death, Ojukwu insisted that the military hierarchy be preserved. The most senior army officer after Ironsi was Brigadier Babafemi Ogundipe. However, the leaders of the countercoup insisted that Lieutenant Colonel Yakubu Gowon be made head of state, although both Gowon and Ojukwu were of the same rank in the Nigerian Army. Ogundipe could not muster enough force in Lagos to establish his authority as soldiers (Guard Battalion) available to him were under Joseph Nanven Garba, who was part of the coup. This realisation led Ogundipe to opt-out. Thus, Ojukwu&#x27;s insistence could not be enforced by Ogundipe unless the coup plotters agreed (which they did not). The fallout from this led to a standoff between Ojukwu and Gowon, leading to the sequence of events that resulted in the Nigerian civil war.

==Biafra==
Following the incessant killings of Igbos all over the nation as a result of tribal intolerance and fear of domination by Igbos with figures ranging from about 4000 to 30000 dead, maimed and missing, Ojukwu, being the southeastern general and Yakubu Gowon who was selected as the supreme general and head of state agreed to hold 
a peace conference at Aburi, Ghana hosted by General Joseph Ankrah. An agreement of autonomy was reached by the two parties where the southeastern region will become independent. However, on reaching Nigeria, Gen. Yakubu Gowon breached the agreement and failed to implement the system of autonomy and further declaring war against the agreed secession of southeastern Nigeria. On 30 May 1967, Ojukwu declared the independence of Biafra, after an official vote of secession conducted in the Eastern Region.

Having mandated me to proclaim on your behalf, and in your name, that Eastern Nigeria is a sovereign independent Republic, now, therefore I, Lieutenant Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, Military Governor of Eastern Nigeria, by the authority, and under the principles recited above, do hereby solemnly proclaim that the territory and region known as and called Eastern Nigeria together with her continental shelf and territorial waters, shall, henceforth, be an independent sovereign state of the name and title of The Republic of Biafra.

On 6 July 1967, Gowon declared war and attacked Biafra. In addition to the Aburi Accord that tried to avoid the war, there was also the Niamey Peace Conference under President Hamani Diori (1968) and the OAU-sponsored Addis Ababa Conference (1968) under the chairmanship of Emperor Haile Selassie. This was the final effort by Generals Ojukwu and Gowon to settle the conflict via diplomacy.

During the war, in 1967, some members of the July 1966 alleged coup plot and Major Victor Banjo were executed for treason with the approval of Ojukwu, the Biafran Supreme commander. Major Ifeajuna was one of those executed. The defendants had argued that they sought a negotiated ceasefire with the federal government and were not guilty of treason.

After two and a half years of fighting and starvation, a hole appeared in the Biafran front lines, and the Nigerian military exploited this. As it became obvious that the war was lost, Ojukwu was convinced to leave the country to avoid prosecution, incarceration or even summary execution. On 9 January 1970, he handed over power to his second in command, Chief of General Staff Major-General Philip Effiong, and left for Ivory Coast, where President Félix Houphouët-Boigny – who had recognised Biafra on 14 May 1968 – granted him political asylum.

==Return to Nigeria==
In 1981, Ojukwu began campaigning to return to Nigeria. Nigerian president Shehu Aliyu Usman Shagari granted a pardon to Ojukwu on 18 May 1982, allowing him to return to Nigeria as a private citizen. Ojukwu re-entered Nigeria from Ivory Coast on 18 June. Ojukwu declared his candidacy for the Nigerian Senate in 1983. The official tally showed him losing by 12,000 votes, though a court attempted to reverse the ruling in September of that year, citing fraud in the election results. However, the disputed result was rendered moot when the Shagari government fell in the 1983 Nigerian coup d&#x27;état on 31 December. In early 1984, the Buhari regime jailed hundreds of political figures, including Ojukwu, who was held at the Kirikiri Maximum Security Prison. He was released later that year.

Ojukwu married Bianca Onoh (former Miss Intercontinental and future ambassador) in 1994, his third marriage. The couple had three children, Afamefuna, Chineme and Nwachukwu. In the Fourth Republic era, Ojukwu unsuccessfully contested the presidency in 2003 and 2007.
==Death==
On 26 November 2011, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu died in the United Kingdom after a brief illness, aged 78. The Nigerian Army accorded him the highest military accolade and conducted a funeral parade for him in Abuja, Nigeria on 27 February 2012, the day his body was flown back to Nigeria from London before his burial on Friday 2 March. He was buried in a newly built mausoleum in his compound at Nnewi. Before his final interment, he had an elaborate weeklong funeral ceremony in Nigeria alongside Chief Obafemi Awolowo, whereby his body was carried around the five Eastern states, Imo, Abia, Enugu, Ebonyi, Anambra, including the nation&#x27;s capital, Abuja. Memorial services and public events were also held in his honour in several places across Nigeria, including Lagos and Niger State, his birthplace, and as far away as Dallas, Texas, United States. 

His funeral was attended by Goodluck Jonathan Former president of Nigeria and ex-President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana among other personalities.

<text>Edward Albert Feigenbaum (born January 20, 1936) is a computer scientist working in the field of artificial intelligence, and joint winner of the 1994 ACM Turing Award. He is often called the &quot;father of expert systems.&quot;

==Education and early life==
Feigenbaum was born in Weehawken, New Jersey in 1936 to a culturally Jewish family, and moved to nearby North Bergen, where he lived until the age of 16, when he left to start college. His hometown did not have a secondary school of its own, and so he chose Weehawken High School for its college preparatory program. He was inducted into his high school&#x27;s hall of fame in 1996.

Feigenbaum completed his undergraduate degree (1956), and a Ph.D. (1960), at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). In his PhD thesis, carried out under the supervision of Herbert A. Simon, he developed EPAM, one of the first computer models of how people learn.

During undergrad years, he took a graduate-level course called &quot;Ideas and Social Change&quot; taught by James March. March introduced him to Herbert Simon. Feigenbaum took a course &quot;Mathematical Models in the Social Sciences&quot; taught by Simon, where Simon announced the Logic Theorist with &quot;Over the Christmas holidays, Al Newell and I invented a thinking machine.&quot; Simon gave Feigenbaum a manual of IBM 701, which he read in one night. Feigenbaum later called it a &quot;born-again experience&quot;.

==Career and research==
Feigenbaum completed a Fulbright fellowship at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) and in 1960 went to the University of California, Berkeley, to teach in the School of Business Administration. He joined the Stanford University faculty in 1965 as one of the founders of its computer science department. He was the director of the Stanford Computation Center from 1965 to 1968. He established the Knowledge Systems Laboratory at Stanford University. Important projects that Feigenbaum was involved in include systems in medicine, as ACME, MYCIN, SUMEX, and Dendral. He also co-founded companies IntelliCorp and Teknowledge.

Teknowledge was founded in July 1981 by 20 computer scientists from Stanford University, MIT, and the Rand Corporation. The company&#x27;s staff &quot;represent about 1/3 of the world&#x27;s high-level expertise in the design and development of knowledge systems&quot;. Its aim was to allow people without training in knowledge-engineering technology to use it for commercial and industrial applications.

In 2000, Feigenbaum became a Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at Stanford University. His former doctoral students include Peter Karp, Niklaus Wirth, and Alon Halevy.

===Honors and awards===

<text>Sidney Rigdon (February 19, 1793 – July 14, 1876) was a leader during the early history of the Latter Day Saint movement.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Rigdon was born in St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, on February 19, 1793. He was the youngest of four children of William and Nancy Rigdon. Rigdon&#x27;s father was a farmer and a native of Harford County, Maryland. He died in 1810.

According to an account by his son John M. Rigdon, young Rigdon 

Rigdon remained on the farm until his mother sold it in 1818.

=== Baptist ministry and tanner ===
On May 31, 1817, Rigdon was baptized by Rev. Phillips, and he became a member of the Peter&#x27;s Creek Baptist Church of Library, Pennsylvania.

In 1818, Rigdon moved to North Sewickley to become an apprentice to Baptist minister Rev. Andrew Clark. Rigdon received his license to preach for the Regular Baptists in March 1819.

Rigdon moved in May to Trumbull County, Ohio, where he jointly preached with Adamson Bentley from July 1819. He married Bentley&#x27;s wife&#x27;s sister, Phoebe Brooks, in June 1820. Rigdon remained in Ohio until February 1822, when he returned to Pittsburgh to accept the pastorate of the First Baptist Church there under the recommendation of Alexander Campbell.

Rigdon and Bentley had journeyed to meet Campbell in the summer of 1821 to learn more about the Baptist who was encountering opposition to his idea that the New Testament should hold priority over the Old Testament in the Christian church. They engaged in lengthy discussions, with both men joining the Disciples of Christ movement associated with Campbell.

On January 28, 1822, Rigdon arrived in Pittsburgh to become a minister at the First Baptist Church. Rigdon&#x27;s ministry met with opposition from member Rev. John Winter, and on July 11, 1823, a schism split the congregation, with each side disfellowshipping the other. On October 11, Rigdon was &quot;excluded from the Redstone Association Baptist Denomination&quot;, of which the First Baptist Church was a member.

From 1824 to 1826, Rigdon worked as a journeyman tanner in Pittsburgh, while preaching Campbell&#x27;s Restorationism on Sundays in the courthouse. He also worked as a journeyman printer for the Philadelphia publisher Paterson. In 1826, Rigdon became the pastor of the more liberal Baptist church in Mentor, Ohio, in the Western Reserve.

=== Latter Day Saint leader in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois (1830–44) ===

Many prominent early Latter Day Saint leaders, including Parley P. Pratt, Isaac Morley, and Edward Partridge, were members of Rigdon&#x27;s congregations prior to their conversion to the Church of Christ founded by Joseph Smith.

==== Early involvement ====

In early September 1830, Rigdon&#x27;s associate, Pratt, was baptized into the Church of Christ founded by Smith. In October, Pratt and Ziba Peterson began a mission to preach to the American Indians.

They visited Rigdon and his wife, Phoebe, in Ohio. Rigdon read the Book of Mormon in fourteen days, proclaimed its truthfulness, and was baptized into the church on November 14, 1830, in Mentor, Ohio. He proceeded to convert hundreds of members of his Ohio congregations. In December 1830, Rigdon traveled to New York, where he met Joseph Smith. He was then ordained a high priest on June 3, 1831.

Rigdon was a fiery orator, and he was immediately called by Smith to be the spokesman for the church. He also served as a scribe and helped with Smith&#x27;s re-translation of the Bible.

; Rigdon as revelator
Rigdon reportedly received visions jointly with Smith. According to one account: .

==== Kirtland, Ohio, 1830–37 ====
In December 1830, Smith said he received a revelation counseling members of the church in New York to gather to Kirtland, Ohio. Many of the doctrines Rigdon&#x27;s group had experimented with found place in the combined movement, such as living with all things in common.
; August/September 1831: Rigdon rebuked
In August 1831, Smith announced that he had received a revelation admonishing Rigdon for exalting himself: 

; March 1832: Tarred and feathered
Smith relocated to Hiram, Ohio, in September 1831. Smith and Rigdon were tarred and feathered at the John Johnson Farm on March 24, 1832. Smith recorded: 

; July 1832: &quot;Rigdon&#x27;s depression&quot;

On July 5, 1832, Rigdon taught that 

In response, Hyrum Smith traveled to retrieve Joseph Smith, who returned to Kirtland on July 7. Joseph Smith rebuked Rigdon, and publicly prophesied that 

Reportedly, 

On July 28, Smith re-ordained Rigdon to the high priesthood after Rigdon had .

; First Presidency

On March 18, 1833, Smith organized the church&#x27;s First Presidency and set apart Jesse Gause and Rigdon as his first two counselors. Smith and Rigdon became close partners, and Rigdon tended to supplant Oliver Cowdery, the original &quot;Second Elder&quot; of the church.

Rigdon became a strong advocate of the construction of the Kirtland Temple. He gave a &quot;powerful discourse&quot; in March 1836 at the temple&#x27;s dedication. When the church founded the Kirtland Safety Society, Rigdon became the bank&#x27;s president and Smith served as its cashier. When the bank failed in 1837, Rigdon and Smith were both blamed by Mormon dissenters. Rigdon supervised the church in Kirtland in Smith&#x27;s absence, and taught at the Kirtland School.

==== Far West, Missouri, 1838 ====
Rigdon and Smith moved to Far West, Missouri, and established a new church headquarters there.

According to one report, while the Mormons were encamped at Adam-ondi-Ahman, Rigdon criticized Smith and others who were engaged in recreational wrestling on Sunday. Rigdon reportedly . Smith . Reportedly, .

As spokesman for the First Presidency, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the Salt Sermon and the July 4th Oration. These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri.

As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state, and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in Liberty Jail. Rigdon was released on a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and made his way to Illinois, where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839.

==== Nauvoo, Illinois, 1839–44 ====
Smith and his followers were allowed to escape from Liberty Jail in Missouri as ordered by Governor Boggs, and so they were released by a sheriff on their way to stand trial. Smith went on to found the city of Nauvoo, Illinois. Rigdon continued to act as church spokesman and gave a speech at the ground-breaking of the Nauvoo Temple. On June 1, 1841, Sidney Rigdon was ordained as a &quot;Prophet, Seer, and Revelator&quot;.

However, Smith and Rigdon&#x27;s relationship began to deteriorate in Nauvoo. Rigdon&#x27;s participation in church administrative affairs became minimal. He did not reside in Nauvoo and served in a local church presidency in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was also in poor health.

In the summer of 1842, John C. Bennett, accused Smith of attempting to take Rigdon&#x27;s daughter Nancy Rigdon as a plural wife. According to Bennett, Nancy rejected the proposal. The accusation led to a confrontation between the Rigdon and Smith families wherein Smith denied having raised the issue with Nancy.

;October 1843: Smith attempts to replace Rigdon
In October 1843, a Special Conference was called to consider &quot;the case and standing of Elder Sidney Rigdon&quot;.

Joseph Smith &quot;stated his dissatisfaction&quot; with Rigdon. Charges were leveled that Rigdon had disloyal correspondences with John C. Bennett, former Governor Carlin, and &quot;the Missourians&quot;. Rigdon was also accused to &quot;leaguing with dishonest persons in endeavoring to defraud the innocent&quot;. In &quot;indirect testimony&quot; from Porter Rockwell&#x27;s mother, Rigdon was accused of having had been responsible for informing others about Smith&#x27;s visit to Dixon and instructing them to arrest him while there.

Smith told the conference that, in light of the charges, Smith requested Rigdon be replaced as First Counselor.

The &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; and the &quot;History of the Church&quot; both record that Rigdon addressed the conference, denied the charges and made a &quot;moving appeal&quot;; they record . A vote was called, and the congregation held that Rigdon would be permitted to retain his position.

According to the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, Smith had and , despite a . Alternately, the &quot;History of the Church&quot; records that Smith replied to the vote by saying, 

;1844: Rigdon as Vice-Presidential candidate
When Smith began his campaign for the presidency of the United States in 1844, Rigdon was selected as his vice-presidential running mate. After Smith&#x27;s death, Rigdon was the senior surviving member of the First Presidency. (The other members were John Smith, who was an assistant counselor, and Amasa Lyman, who was a counselor.) During this time, Rigdon was strongly opposed to polygamy and other innovations within the church.

=== Aftermath of Smith&#x27;s death ===
Joseph Smith was killed in 1844. Prior to Smith&#x27;s death, the First Presidency had made nearly all the major decisions for the church. In 1841, Rigdon had been ordained by Smith as a &quot;Prophet, Seer, and Revelator&quot;, as had all other members of the First Presidency and of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church.

Rigdon returned to Nauvoo on August 3, and the next day he announced at a public meeting that he had received a revelation appointing him &quot;Guardian of the Church&quot;. The president of the central stake, William Marks, supported Rigdon.

At an August 8 conference, Rigdon argued that he should be made the &quot;Protector&quot; of the church.&quot; Brigham Young, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, opposed this motion and asserted a claim for the primacy of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The Quorum of Twelve Apostles were scattered throughout the United States and Europe at the time of Smith&#x27;s death. The members of the quorum available in Illinois, in addition to a gathered assembly, voted to deny Rigdon his claim for church leadership. Rigdon felt this action was done without proper order.

One month later, on September 8, Rigdon was excommunicated from the church by a Common Council of the Church, which had been convened by Presiding Bishop Newel K. Whitney. Rigdon refused to attend this trial, after which he, in turn, likewise excommunicated the members of the Twelve. Rigdon fled Nauvoo, claiming that he felt threatened by Young&#x27;s supporters.

=== Latter Day Saint leader in Pennsylvania and New York, 1845–76 ===

After the succession schism, Rigdon solidified and led an independent faction of Latter Day Saints, originally called the &quot;Church of Christ&quot;, but at one point was called as the Church of Jesus Christ of the Children of Zion. This sect is often referred to as the Rigdonites. The Latter Day Saints who followed Rigdon separated themselves and settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On April 6, 1845, Rigdon presided over a conference of the Church of Christ, which he claimed was the rightful continuation of the church founded by Smith. He then reorganized the First Presidency and called his own Quorum of Twelve Apostles.

Although Rigdon&#x27;s church briefly flourished through the publication of his periodical, &quot;The Messenger and Advocate&quot;, quarrels and bickering among the Rigdonites led most members of the church to desert the senior leader by 1847. A few loyalists, notably William Bickerton, eventually reorganized the church in 1862 under the name The Church of Jesus Christ.

Rigdon lived on for many years in Pennsylvania and New York. He maintained his testimony of the Book of Mormon and clung to his claims that he was the rightful heir to Joseph Smith. He died in Friendship, New York, on July 14, 1876.

== Significance in the Latter Day Saint movement ==

Following the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, a succession crisis led to schisms within the movement. The Brigham Young branch traveled west to Utah, while Rigdon traveled eastward to Pittsburgh.

Rigdon&#x27;s branch faced less success, modernly accounting for only a small fraction of practicing Latter Day Saints.

As early as 1834, skeptics were promoting what has become known as the Spalding-Rigdon theory of Book of Mormon authorship, in which Rigdon plays a central role.

=== Churches tracing their leadership through Rigdon ===
== Rigdon as purported author of the Book of Mormon ==

Rigdon has been named as a potential author for the Book of Mormon. According to this theory, Rigdon obtained from a Pittsburgh publisher a manuscript for a historical novel written by Solomon Spalding, and by reworking it and adding a theological component, created the Book of Mormon.

The theory that Sidney Rigdon was the true author of the Book of Mormon first appeared in print in an August 31, 1831, article by James Gordon Bennett, who had visited the Palmyra/Manchester area and interviewed several residents. The theory of Rigdon&#x27;s use of a Spalding manuscript first appeared in print in the 1834 book &quot;Mormonism Unvailed&quot;. The theory also later appeared in 1867 in &quot;Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism&quot; by Pomeroy Tucker, in which he says Smith was visited by a &quot;mysterious stranger&quot; as early as 1827, who Tucker implies played a role in the creation of the Book of Mormon and later identifies the stranger as Rigdon.

This theory and the testimony of Rigdon to his son John, just prior to Rigdon&#x27;s death and long after he had ceased an affiliation with any of the sects of Mormonism, contradict each other: However, Rigdon&#x27;s grandson, Walter Sidney Rigdon, stated in an interview that the family knew that the &quot;Golden Bible&quot; was a hoax, contrived by Rigdon and Joseph Smith, to make money and that it was based on the Spalding manuscript.

A 2008 computer analysis of the Book of Mormon text supports this theory, although the study does not include Joseph Smith in the author sample on the ground that few pure examples of Smith&#x27;s writings are extant. Several other significant problems are apparent in the methodology of this computer analysis, specifically the use of closed set methodology instead of open set methodology. For example, the original methodology, when replicated, also assigns Rigdon as the probable author of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, which were written five years before his birth.

<text>is a Japanese multinational manufacturing company founded in 1931 by Shojiro Ishibashi (18891976) in the city of Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan. The name Bridgestone comes from a calque translation and transposition of (), meaning &#x27;stone bridge&#x27; in Japanese. It primarily manufactures tires, as well as golf equipment.

As of 2021, Bridgestone is the largest manufacturer of tires in the world, followed by Michelin, Goodyear, Continental, and Pirelli.

Bridgestone Group has 181 production facilities in 24 countries as of July 2018.

==History==
===Origins===
The history of the &quot;Bridgestone Tire Company, Ltd.&quot;, founded in 1931 by Shojiro Ishibashi in Japan. The first Bridgestone tire was produced on 9 April 1930, by the Japanese &quot;Tabi&quot; Socks Tire Division (actually made jika-tabi). One year later on 1 March 1931, the founder, Shojiro Ishibashi, made the &quot;Tabi&quot; Socks Tire Division independent and established the Bridgestone Tire Co., Ltd. in the city of Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture. &quot;Bridgestone&quot; was named after the name of the founder, Shojiro Ishibashi (; ).

Foregoing dependence on European and North American technology, the Bridgestone Tire Co., Ltd. set its eyes on manufacturing tires based largely on Japanese technology. The fledgling company experienced many difficulties in the areas of technology, production, and sales in the early days. Eventually, improvements were achieved in quality and manufacturing processes which led to the business rapidly expanding in domestic and overseas markets.

===Challenges during and after World War II===
Wartime regulations were in effect throughout Japan during World War II, and tires also came under the jurisdiction of these regulations. This resulted in nearly all of the company&#x27;s output being used to satisfy military demand. 1945 saw the end of armed conflict, but the company was devastated by the war. The Tokyo headquarters was destroyed during an aerial bombing raid, and all overseas assets were lost. The plants in Kurume and Yokohama escaped unscathed, and production was able to resume immediately after the war ended. Brushing aside the problems caused by a labour union strike that lasted for 46 days, the foundations of the company were further reinforced after this.

After the war the company started making bicycles, with the Bridgestone Cycle Company being formed in 1949. From 1952 the first complete powered bicycles were produced, with a 26cc engine. In 1958 the first 50cc Bridgestone motorcycles were manufactured, but the company&#x27;s main income was from supplying tires to its rival motorcycle makers such as Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha and it was later decided to cease motorcycle manufacturing.

In 1952, Ishibashi founded the Bridgestone Museum of Art and located it at 10 Kyobashi 1chome, Chuoku, Tokyo 104; Bridgestone Corporation&#x27;s company headquarters.

===Technological innovation===

In 1951, Bridgestone was the first company in Japan to begin selling rayon cord tires, and a fiveyear project to modernize production facilities was started. This year also saw another Bridgestone building opened in Kyōbashi, Tokyo, which contained the Bridgestone Museum. Sales surpassed ten billion yen in 1953, placing Bridgestone at the top of the tire industry in Japan, and celebrations were held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the company&#x27;s foundation in Kurume.

The sale of nylon tires was started in 1959, and work forged ahead with the construction of the new Tokyo plant, which was opened in 1960, in order to cope with the fastexpanding market for motorization.

===Radial tires and overseas expansion===
The company issued stock shares and was listed on the stock exchange in 1961. A new system of administration was ushered in by Shojiro Ishibashi as the chairman, and Kanichiro Ishibashi as the president. As part of the transition across to administrative reform, the Deming Plan in honor of W. Edwards Deming, which involves overall quality control activities, was adopted, and the company was awarded the prestigious Deming Prize in 1968. Also, additions were built onto the Tokyo plant in 1962 to house the new Technical Centre, and a progressive system of research and development was established. On the product front, 1967 saw the sale of the company&#x27;s first ever radial tire, the RD10.

Bridgestone&#x27;s first overseas plant since the end of the war was opened in Singapore in 1965, and production was also commenced in Thailand in 1969. The 1960s for Bridgestone was an era of overseas expansion that also included the establishment of Bridgestone Americas in the United States in 1967 to act as Bridgestone&#x27;s USA representative sales branch.

At the start of the period of Japan&#x27;s economic stagnation, brought about by the first oil shock, the company was placing even more emphasis on establishing its own technology for the manufacture of radial tires, and it was also at this time that further domestic plants were constructed and fitted out. Its Super Filler Radial was placed on the market in 1978, and in 1979 the company introduced the highperformance POTENZA radial tire, from an Italian word for power.

The company was actively engaged in overseas expansion activities at this time. In addition to starting up production in Indonesia and Iran in 1976, it also invested in a Taiwan tire manufacturer and purchased a tire plant and a plant for diversified products in Australia in 1980. The founder, Shojiro Ishibashi, died on 11 September 1976.

On 1 March 1981, the company celebrated its 50th anniversary. At the same time, the company initiated activities to strengthen its home base that supported overseas expansion strategy with the aim of being ranked as one of the world&#x27;s top three manufacturers of rubber products. New production facilities were also established in Thailand, India, Poland, China, the United States and other countries. The company changed the name from Bridgestone Tire Co., Ltd. to Bridgestone Corporation in 1984.

===Firestone Tire and Rubber Company purchase===
In 1988, Bridgestone purchased the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of Akron, Ohio. Placing considerable financial and personnel resources into rebuilding Firestone after the purchase, Bridgestone achieved surplus annual profits for the year 1992 with BFE (&quot;Bridgestone Firestone Europe&quot;) and again in 1993 with BFS (&quot;Bridgestone Firestone USA&quot;). The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and Bridgestone Tire Company Ltd. USA were amalgamated in 1990 and became &quot;Bridgestone Firestone North American Holdings Ltd&quot;. The North American subsidiary of Bridgestone Corporation is now named Bridgestone Americas, Inc. The tire division is Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations, LLC.

In April 2012, Bridgestone Americas opened up its new 
&quot;Bridgestone Americas Technical Center&quot; in Akron. The $100 million facility, located just down the street from the former headquarters, tire plant, and technical center, houses 450 employees whose jobs are to develop innovative and advanced tire technologies for the company.

In June 2022, Bridgestone opened up its $21 million &quot;Advanced Tire Production Center&quot; which replaced the &quot;Firestone Advance Tire Works Plant&quot; at the original Firestone Tire and Rubber Company headquarters which opened in 1910. The new building is home of the company&#x27;s racing tire production for the NTT IndyCar Series. The plant manufactures all Firestone Firehawk racing tires. It is the first new tire plant in the city of Akron in more than 70 years. Bridgestone also opened up a $6 million test track adjacent to the &quot;Advanced Tire Production Center&quot; to support passenger tire testing and development. The test track opened in autumn 2022. Bridgestone has invested more than $125 million in its Akron operations since 2012, when the company opened the Bridgestone Americas Technology Center.

==Bridgestone&#x27;s global locations==
Bridgestone has major manufacturing plants in many countries around the world. As of 1 April 2011, Bridgestone has 47 tire plants, 29 tirerelated plants, 19 raw materials plants, 89 diversified product plants, 4 technical centers, and 11 proving grounds globally. 

Some of the major plants are located in:

===Australia===
Bridgestone Australia is headquartered in Eastwood, an inner-southern suburb of Adelaide, South Australia.

Beginning as the SA Rubber Mills in 1939, Bridgestone took over the Australian plants which were at that time operated by the Uniroyal Tyre Company in 1980. Bridgestone Australia had a major manufacturing tire factory in Australia: located in Salisbury, a northern suburb of Adelaide (this plant was eventually decommissioned in April 2011). Bridgestone has State Offices in all states of Australia, and has a large number of retail outlets across the country.

In 2000 Bridgestone Australia Ltd. purchased the BANDAG Retreading plant and its operations in Australia. Bandag Manufacturing Pty Limited has 35 franchised dealers across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Nouméa. Bandag Manufacturing Pty Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bridgestone Australia Limited, and operates under license to Bandag Incorporated. In 2006 Bridgestone purchased Bandag Incorporated, which is now a subsidiary of Bridgestone Corporation.

From the purchase in 1981, the Australian operations of Bridgestone have been run as a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock exchange. Bridgestone Corporation has maintained a majority share holding. As of mid2007 the Australian operation was delisted from the Australian Stock exchange and became a solely owned Division of Bridgestone Corporation (pending minority shareholder approval as per Australian Corporate Law).

Following the cancellation on Friday, 11 May 2007, of all shares held by minority shareholders, Bridgestone Australia Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bridgestone Corporation of Japan. The selective capital reduction and subsequent privatisation which cost $49 million was approved and completed. Bridgestone Australia Ltd. was delisted from the ASX on 30 May 2007.

===Europe===
Bridgestone EU has its head office in Brussels, Belgium, and was set up in 1990 as Bridgestone/Firestone Europe SA. Before that, a representative office in Belgium set up in 1972 and sales subsidiary companies and importers in each countries were selling products imported from Japan. There are 7 production plants in the region and a 32 hectare research and development centre near Rome, Italy. The company distributes more than 25 million tires a year through 17 national sales subsidiaries and 2 distributors. They directly employ over 12,000 people with Mr. Tsuda as CEO.

At present there are national headquarters in the following locations: Vienna, Austria; Prague, Czech Republic; Hinnerup, Denmark; Vantaa, Finland; Fresnes, France; Bad Homburg, Germany; Athens, Greece; Budapest, Hungary; Dublin, Ireland; Milan, Italy; Moerdijk, Netherlands; Oslo, Norway; Warsaw, Poland; Alcochete, Portugal; Madrid, Spain; Sundsvall, Sweden; Spreitenbach, Switzerland; Istanbul, Turkey and Warwick, UK.

Bridgestone EU runs a continentwide scheme called Truckpoint wherein fleets can take their vehicles to any Bridgestone approved garage throughout Europe and get Bridgestone specialist work carried out on their tires.

There are no Bridgestone factories in the United Kingdom but there is a technical bay at which tyres returned by dissatisfied customers are inspected in Coventry.

The plant at Ulyanovsk, Russia and the marketing office in Moscow were sold in December 2023 as Bridgestone withdrew from the Russian market, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===North America===
As part of reinforcement plans, the company purchased a plant in Tennessee from the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, its first manufacturing plant in North America, and started the production of radial tires for trucks and buses in 1983. Bridgestone also has a steel cord plant in Clarksville, Tennessee, named Bridgestone Metalpha. Metalpha is currently ranked as the top provider in the global steel cord market.

In May 1988, a takeover bid of America&#x27;s No. 2 tire manufacturer, Akron, Ohiobased Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, was successful, and Firestone was placed under the Bridgestone umbrella as a subsidiary company. This purchase brought a large number of Firestone global production sites into the Bridgestone organization. These sites included North America, Central and South America, Europe, New Zealand and other locations. Bridgestone also commenced production in Turkey. In 1992, the company established regional corporate offices in Europe and the Americas.

Nashvillebased Bridgestone Americas, Inc. (BSA) is the American subsidiary of the Bridgestone Corporation. BSA and its subsidiaries develop, manufacture and market Bridgestone, Firestone, and associate brand tires for consumers, automotive and commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers, and those in the agricultural, forestry and mining industries. The companies also produce air springs, roofing materials, synthetic rubber and industrial fibers and textiles and operate the world&#x27;s largest chain of automotive tire and service centers.

In November 2010, ASA Automotive Systems Inc. was selected by the Consumer Tire Sales division of Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations, LLC (BATO) as the software provider for their North American consumer dealers to supply the industry&#x27;s leading &#x27;AllinOne&#x27; PointofSale, Accounting and Inventory shop management software.

In 2014, Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations (BATO) unveiled its newly rebranded GCR Tires &amp; Service division. With one of the largest network of commercial stores across the country, GCR&#x27;s reach extends nationwide. The letters of GCR reflect the last names of the original company founders Balie Griffith, Harold Crawford and Perry Rose.

In 2015, Bridgestone Americas Inc. signed a deal giving its dealers the option to install digital air calibration machines from Excel Tire Gauge Inc. in their stores. The digital air calibration machines streamline the tire inflation process by automatically inflating or deflating tires.

In 2017, Bridgestone Americas consolidated many of their business units into a single building in downtown Nashville, Bridgestone Tower. Nearly 2,000 employees work in the new skyscraper, nestled between the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Schermerhorn Symphony Center.

In April 2020, due to demand by essential service providers during COVID-19 pandemic in Tennessee, Bridgestone Americas announced plans to restart its North American commercial tire plants as well as its North American Firestone Industrial Products and Firestone Building Products manufacturing facilities.

==Sports sponsorships==
===Formula racing===
Bridgestone started to invest in motorsport in the 1980s by developing race tires for feeder series like Formula 2, Formula 3, Formula Ford, Formula Opel Lotus and karting.

In order to increase the Firestone subsidiary&#x27;s brand awareness, &quot;Bridgestone Firestone NAH Ltd&quot;, reentered the Firestone brand into CART open-wheel racing in 1995 to challenge Goodyear. The tires proved better and Goodyear left the series for 2000. Since then, Firestone has been the single tire provider for the successor Champ Car World Series, the IndyCar Series and its feeder series Indy NXT.

Bridgestone has supplied tires in Formula One since , although the company oneoff produced Formula One tires at the 1976 and 1977 Japanese Grand Prix for Japanese entrants such as Kazuyoshi Hoshino&#x27;s Heros Racing and Kojima.
The Japanese company decided to supply tires for Formula One in 1995, backedup by the CEO Yoichiro Kaizaki, aiming to improve Bridgestone&#x27;s name value in the European market which was greatly inferior compared with their archrivals, Michelin. Though it was scheduled to enter the championship in the 1998 season at first, this was brought forward to because the engineering section led by Hirohide Hamashima had quickly advanced development. Thus, Hiroshi Yasukawa, the general manager of Motorsport Department, also made the best use of the experience and networks in Europe since the Bridgestone&#x27;s European F2 era () and constructed logistics for Formula One at once.

The first title was acquired right away in the second year, 1998 by Mika Häkkinen and McLarenMercedes. And Bridgestone users took five Drivers&#x27; Championship titles and five Constructors&#x27; Championship titles (, ) for the period that competed with Goodyear () and Michelin (). Especially, cooperation with Scuderia Ferrari and Michael Schumacher functioned well in this period.

From 2008 to 2010 Bridgestone was due to be the sole tire supplier to the FIA Formula One World Championship. However, because Michelin chose to conclude its Formula One tire programme at the end of the 2006 season, all teams used Bridgestone tires from the 2007 season to the 2010 Formula One season.

On 2 November 2009, Bridgestone announced that they would not be renewing their contract to supply tires to Formula One teams after 2010. The company said it was &quot;addressing the impact of the continuing evolution of the business environment&quot;. Pirelli announced in June 2010 that it would serve as sole supplier for tires in the 2011 season.

===Sports car and touring car racing===
In the 1980s and 1990s, Bridgestone provided tires to the Le Mans sport prototypes of teams Nismo and TOM&#x27;s, backed by Japanese automobile manufacturers Nissan and Toyota respectively. In the early 1990s, Bridgestone expanded to Mercedes-AMG, which entered the DTM and later Le Mans and the FIA GT Championship. The brand left international sports car racing in 2000, but remains as one of the main suppliers in the Super GT series. Since April 2023, Bridgestone became the main tire supplier for the Super Taikyu championship series replacing Hankook, which supplied its tires briefly until forced to exit the series due the latter&#x27;s Daejeon plant fire.

===Motorcycling===
In 2002, Bridgestone entered the Grand Prix motorcycle racing&#x27;s main class MotoGP. From 2009 to 2015, it was the exclusive tire supplier of the championship and reached the milestone of 100 MotoGP victories in 2012. Ninetime World Champion Valentino Rossi was &#x27;Bridgestone Tyre Adviser&#x27; having won two MotoGP titles on Bridgestone tires in 2008 and 2009.

In May 2014, Bridgestone announced they would leave Moto GP at the end of the 2015 season.

===Other sports===
Bridgestone is currently the Official Tire of the Olympic Games, but have stated they will not be renewing their worldwide partnership agreements with the Olympics and Paralympics when they expire at the end of 2024. In 2010, Bridgestone acquired the naming rights to the home venue of the NHL&#x27;s Nashville Predators calling it Bridgestone Arena. They were also the title sponsor for Copa Libertadores, the top competition for South American club football, from 2013 to 2017, and Copa Sudamericana from 2011 to 2013.

==Diversified products==
The predecessors of Bridgestone began making diversified products in the 1930s, soon after they started making tires. Today, Bridgestone diversified operations encompass automotive components, industrial products, polyurethane foam products, construction materials, parts and materials for electronic equipment, bicycles and sporting goods. Diversified business generates about one-fourth of total sales in the Bridgestone Group.

Automotive parts are an especially large line of business for Bridgestone in diversified operations. Bridgestone supplies automakers with vibrationisolating components, such as engine mounts. Bridgestone also supplies air springs for trucks, automobiles and train carriages. Bridgestone market aluminium wheels and other automotive accessories, too.

===Industrial products===
Bridgestone&#x27;s industrial products span a vast range, including polyurethane foam for automotive seats and interiors, for bedding and furniture and for insulation and sealing in appliances and buildings; water hoses; marine hoses for loading and unloading oil tankers; specialty precision hose products, such as wireblade hose for construction equipment and machine tools; conveyor belts; and rubber tracks for crawler tractors. Additionally, they make retreaded tires for aircraft. Their corporate headquarters for the Bridgestone Aircraft tire division is located in Miami, Florida.

The Bridgestone product line in construction and civil engineering materials is similarly broad. Bridgestone supply MultiRubber Bearings for installing in foundations to protect buildings from earthquakes, inflatable rubber dams for managing waterways (no longer manufactured 2008), marine fenders for protecting wharves, additives for pavement, waterproofing sheet, rubberized ceiling and roofing materials, panel tanks for storing water, bath fixtures and residential flooring, air and water systems.

Bridgestone&#x27;s line of products for electronic equipment includes precision rollers for office machines and functional films for solar cells and plasma displays. In sporting goods, Bridgestone market golf balls and clubs and tennis balls and rackets. Bridgestone&#x27;s line of bicycles is Japan&#x27;s most extensive see above information re. Anchor Cycles.

===Bridgestone Commercial Services Group (Bandag)===

On 5 December 2006, Bridgestone Americas and Bandag, Inc. announced a merger agreement whereby Bridgestone would acquire Muscatine, Iowabased Bandag, Inc., a leading truck tire retreader that was founded in 1957 and had over 900 franchised dealers worldwide at the time. In announcing the merger, Bridgestone&#x27;s president in Tokyo explained: 
The transaction was valued at approximately US$1.05 billion. On 31 May 2007, the agreement was consummated and Bridgestone Americas acquired the outstanding shares of Bandag stock for US$50.75 per share. The unit was renamed Bridgestone Bandag, LLC and Saul Solomon was appointed to the position of chairman, CEO and President. Previously, Solomon served as Vice President and General Counsel of BSAH. 
In the four years following the acquisition, Bandag&#x27;s headquarters remained in Muscatine, although some processes and functions were consolidated and/or transferred to other facilities. In November 2010, corporate headquarters were moved to Nashville. In May 2011, the unit was renamed Bridgestone Commercial Services Group, eliminating the name &quot;Bandag.&quot;
===Bicycles===

The Bridgestone Cycle Co Ltd. originated in 1949. It offers bicycles under its own brand and under the Anchor brand.

At one time, Bridgestone marketed bicycles under the name Kabuki.

The U.S. marketing director of the Bicycle division, Grant Petersen, developed a reputation for resisting popular trends in the bicycle industry and instead followed his own personal philosophy of building dependable and comfortable bicycles. Peterson applied this approach to Rivendell Bicycle Works after Bridgestone stopped marketing bicycles in the U.S.

The company was an innovator in the nascent mountain bike scene, designing mountain bikes with shorter chain-stays and steeper frame angles than then popular. This made it more nimble and a better climber.

Until 1986, Bridgestone models were numbered in multiples of 100, with the higher numbers indicating a higher end bike. The entry level road bike in 1986, for example, may have been the Bridgestone 100, while the Bridgestone 700 would have been a competition level race bike. Beginning in 1987 there was a change, with model designations consisting of two letters followed by a numeral. The letters indicated the type of bike, and the number indicated the position in the product lineup. The numbering was also reversed, with the smaller numbers indicating a higher position in the product line. For example, the RB1 would have been the topoftheline road bike, followed by the RB2, RB3, etc.

Bridgestone is currently building frames in Japan for keirin track racing under Nihon Jitensha Shinkokai approved standards. It is currently producing nonNJS frames for the Japanese market as well.

In Japan, it is known as a manufacturer of utility, mountain and (under the brand name Anchor) road racing bikes.

Bridgestone has also collaborated with Alex Moulton to produce the Bridgestone Moulton Bicycle and marketed its own folding bicycle, the Bridgestone Picnica.

Bridgestone also released a range of BMX Bicycles in 19811982 known as the MKI &amp; MKII.

===Motorcycles===

Bridgestone motorcycles were a division of the company that produced mopeds and motorcycles from 1952 to 1970. Initially producing power assisted bicycles, the division moved on to producing mopeds and then motorcycles. The motorcycles were technologically advanced and powered by two-stroke engines. The high technical specification resulted in the machines being more expensive compared to other manufacturers models. Production was stopped in 1970 to protect the supply of tires to other manufacturers.

===Bridgestone Aircraft Tire===
Bridgestone Aircraft Tire (USA) is a manufacturer of aircraft tires as well as retread servicing. Bridgestone Americas Holdings announced in May 2006 that it would be moving its Miami, Florida aviation operation to its new facility located in Mayodan, North Carolina, this move is expected to be completed by mid2007 and will create approximately 95 new jobs. CEO and President of Bridgestone Aircraft Tire (USA) Joe Rayna is quoted as saying; &quot;This move allows us to continue to prepare for a changing market, both in demand and in product mix, New modern aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A380, arrive fitted with new Bridgestone technology aircraft tires, and this new facility will complement that technology&quot;. Bridgestone Aircraft Tire (USA) has been a major supplier of aircraft tires and retreads to the aircraft industry for over 70 years and has sister aviation facilities in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Belgium.

===Golf products===

Bridgestone Golf is a division of Bridgestone, and is the brand name under which Bridgestone&#x27;s Golfing Products are marketed. Bridgestone has been producing golfrelated products since 1935. The Golf division of Bridgestone currently produces clubs, balls and accessories. Along with technical developments in tire technology came breakthroughs in golf ball technology that have led Bridgestone to be the number one golf ball producer in Japan.

Design and production of golf clubs followed in 1972.

Bridgestone has global coverage of its golfing products with major divisions in USA (Bridgestone Golf USA), Australia (Bridgestone Golf Australia) and Korea (Sokio Corporation).

===Dolphin artificial caudal fin===

In 2003, the caudal fin of Fuji, a Bottlenose dolphin bred at the Okichan Theater of Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium, was necrotic, necessitating the removal of 75% of the fin which made swimming impossible. The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium started a project to develop the world&#x27;s first artificial dolphin caudal fin in cooperation with Bridgestone to replace Fuji&#x27;s fin. In the early days, the artificial caudal fin could not be installed well because it could not withstand the swimming of dolphins, but aquariums made improvements and succeeded in installing the artificial caudal fin of the dolphin.

In 2010, it was also installed in Pacific white-sided dolphin named Lanan, who was bred in Notojima Aquarium, and succeeded in installing the second artificial caudal fin in the world.

==Bridgestone eReporter==
Bridgestone ereporter is a panEuropean competition for aspiring young sports journalists, open to all students aged 1830, who are in fulltime education.

Now in its fifth year, Bridgestone ereporter continues to provide upandcoming writers with first hand experience, interviewing GP2 drivers and issuing race reports from a European GP2 race weekend.

The 2008 competition was officially launched on 1 February 2008 with the deadline for entries at 12.00 GMT on 31 March 2008. As of 2009, Bridgestone has not held further editions of the eReporter competition. However it may return in a different form in the future.

Bridgestone was the sole tire supplier for the GP2 series, an openwheeled racing championship that is widely regarded as the feeder series for Formula One.

==Controversies==

After Bridgestone purchased Firestone in 1988, cost cutting measures led to tread separations in tires manufactured in Firestone plants in the 1990s.

In 2008, Bridgestone ran an advert during the Super Bowl XLII showing a cardriver avoiding several hazards while driving at night, including threatening to run down Richard Simmons, who was embodying a homophobic sissy stereotype, with &quot;Ad Age&quot;″s critic Bob Garfield describing the advert as &quot;grounded in homophobia&quot;.

In September 2011, Bridgestone pleaded guilty to bribing Latin American officials and bid rigging, and agreed to pay a $28 million fine to resolve criminal charges.

In February 2014 Bridgestone agreed to a $425 million fine imposed by the United States Department of Justice for price fixing and bid rigging in the automotive parts industry. The company said it regretted the actions that led to the plea deal and said it would take disciplinary action against certain employees. One executive and two other former executives were indicted for conspiracy.

In February 2022, shortly after outsourcing the majority of its IT employees, Bridgestone Americas was hacked. This resulted in the theft of company data, manufacturing plants in North and South America to be closed, and production to be halted.

<text>Scott Levy (born September 8, 1964) is an American professional wrestler better known by his ring name, Raven. He is best known for his appearances with professional wrestling promotions Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Widely recognized as &quot;one of the best talkers in wrestling&quot;, Raven is known for his &quot;psychological heel tactics&quot; and grunge-inspired gimmick. His feud with The Sandman in the mid-1990s has been described as &quot;one of the most emotional rivalries in professional wrestling&#x27;s history&quot;.

After having an eight-plus year career in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Raven was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==
Levy is of Jewish descent and was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Paul F. Levy, a journalist and senior editor of &quot;The National Enquirer&quot;. He graduated from Lake Worth Community High School in 1982. He went on to attend the University of Delaware, where he earned a degree in criminal justice. He took a semester off from college to enlist in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1988–1992) ===
Levy trained as a professional wrestler under Larry Sharpe at the Monster Factory in New Jersey, making his debut on February 20, 1988, against Jimmy Jack Funk.

Early in his career, Levy competed for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico as well as the Memphis, Tennessee-based promotion Continental Wrestling Association under the ring name &quot;Scotty the Body&quot;, where he was given the gimmick of being the &quot;boy toy&quot; of Missy Hyatt, who used him to her and Eddie Gilbert&#x27;s advantage. After leaving Memphis, Levy wrestled in Florida.

Levy next traveled to Canada, where he competed briefly for the Vancouver, British Columbia-based promotion All Star Wrestling before leaving due to differences with owner Al Tomko. From there, he returned to the United States, joining Pacific Northwest Wrestling in Portland, Oregon. Over the next three years, he was positioned as one of the main heels, winning all of the titles and feuding heavily with Steve Doll. His manager in PNW was Taylor Made. After taking a brief break from competing, he returned to PNW as a face and began a feud with The Grappler. In the summer of 1989, Levy made a number of appearances under a mask as &quot;Matman&quot;, a &quot;Batman&quot;-inspired character who teamed with Beetlejuice.

Wrestling as Scotty the Body, Levy made a one-off appearance on &quot;WWF Prime Time Wrestling&quot; in a losing effort against Koko B. Ware on October 9, 1990.

After leaving PNW, Levy joined the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation, where he adopted the ring name &quot;Scott Anthony&quot;. Levy was part of the stable known as &quot;The Cartel&quot;, along with Cactus Jack, Makhan Singh, Rip Rogers and Max Andrews. Levy also served as a color commentator for GWF&#x27;s televised broadcasts on ESPN alongside play-by-play commentators Craig Johnson and Scott Hudson.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1992–1993) ===

In 1992, Levy joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He was given the ring name &quot;Scotty Flamingo&quot; and the gimmick of a surfer from Florida, even carrying a surfboard to the ring. According to him, he didn&#x27;t like the character nor the High-Flying style, but he was forced by the promoters. He was originally managed by J. T. Southern. Levy competed in the WCW light heavyweight division, winning the WCW Light Heavyweight Championship from Brian Pillman on June 20, 1992, at Beach Blast. He held the title until July 5, 1992, when he was defeated by Brad Armstrong. Levy went on to align himself with Diamond Dallas Page and Vinnie Vegas as a member of &quot;The Diamond Mine&quot;. Levy would continue to feud with Pillman and Armstrong, before feuding with Johnny B. Badd. At &quot;Clash of the Champions XXI&quot; on November 18, 1992, Levy defeated Badd in a boxing match via knockout after Vegas surreptitiously weighted his boxing glove by soaking it in water. Levy left WCW in February 1993 after disagreements with booker Bill Watts.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1993–1994) ===
After leaving WCW, Levy briefly wrestled for the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as manager &quot;Johnny Polo&quot;, a spoiled, rich preppy kid. He was initially placed with Adam Bomb, appearing for the first time on May 22 episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;. He managed Bomb for four months until he was replaced by Harvey Wippleman. He then became the manager of The Quebecers in September, whom he led to three reigns as WWF Tag Team Champions. In addition to managing, Polo also occasionally appeared in tag-team and singles competition, facing Jim Powers, Virgil, Rick Steiner, Marty Jannetty, Doink the Clown, 1-2-3 Kid, Owen Hart, and Pierre Ouellet. Polo also worked as a color commentator and co-host of Radio WWF, and behind the scenes worked as the associate producer for &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. Levy left the company in October 1994, his final match coming against Adam Bomb on October 2 in Auburn Hills, Michigan. His last appearance as Johnny Polo was at a house show in Montreal, Quebec on October 21 when he managed Pierre Ouellet in a match against Jacques Rougeau.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995–1997) ===

==== Feud with Tommy Dreamer (1995–1996) ====

After leaving the WWF, Levy began developing a new character, &quot;Raven&quot;. Inspired by the poem by Edgar Allan Poe and by Patrick Swayze&#x27;s manipulative Zen master of crime in the film &quot;Point Break&quot;, the Raven character was a depressed, sociopathic, stoical, nihilistic misanthrope who would deliver eloquent, philosophical promos peppered with literary allusions and ending with the catchphrase, &quot;Quoth the Raven &#x27;Nevermore&#x27;&quot;. Levy dramatically altered his appearance, bulking-up to approximately 235 lbs (107 kg), adding nose and eyebrow piercings and began wrestling in ragged jean shorts, a leather jacket, rock band or comic book t-shirts, combat boots and a flannel tied around his waist. After unsuccessfully pitching the character to Jim Cornette, the owner of Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), Raven approached Paul Heyman, the booker of the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), who agreed to bring in Raven as a foil for Tommy Dreamer.

Raven was introduced to ECW by Stevie Richards. In late 1994, Richards had developed an &quot;identity crisis&quot;, performing under the ring names &quot;Stevie Flamingo&quot;, &quot;Stevie the Body&quot;, and &quot;Stevie Polo&quot;—all references to former ring names used by Levy. After sustaining another loss to Tommy Dreamer, Richards became irate and claimed he would present &quot;the real Johnny Polo&quot;. Raven made his first appearance on the January 10, 1995 episode of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot;, with Richards revealing that he had a vendetta against Tommy Dreamer.

Raven formed a stable of known as &quot;Raven&#x27;s Nest&quot;, with Richards the first member. In February, Johnny Hotbody and Tony Stetson joined the stable, calling Raven the &quot;voice of [their] generation&quot;. On March 18, 1995, at Extreme Warfare, Dreamer lost to the four members of Raven&#x27;s Nest in a gauntlet match.
On April 8, 1995, at Three Way Dance, Raven fired Hotbody and Stetson, replacing them with The Pitbulls. Later that evening, Raven expounded on his history with Dreamer, revealed that they had attended summer camp together as children, where Raven became the boyfriend of Beulah McGillicutty, an overweight girl with acne, after she was spurned by Dreamer. Richards then revealed that he had tracked down McGillicutty, who was now a &quot;Penthouse&quot; model, who also harbored a grudge against Dreamer. Later that night, Raven faced Dreamer in a singles match for the first time, defeating him following interference from both Richards and McGillicutty. McGillicutty went on to become Raven&#x27;s valet and onscreen girlfriend, repeatedly interfering in his bouts with Dreamer and receiving numerous piledrivers as a result. McGillicutty was brought into ECW by Raven, who had been introduced to her by Ron Gant in Florida earlier that year and thought she would add a new dimension to his feud with Dreamer.
The feud between Raven and Dreamer escalated at Barbed Wire, Hoodies &amp; Chokeslams in June 1995, where Raven&#x27;s Nest beat down Dreamer&#x27;s ally, Luna Vachon, before breaking several of Dreamer&#x27;s fingers. On June 30, 1995, at Mountain Top Madness, Raven and Richards defeated The Public Enemy to win the ECW World Tag Team Championship.

In July 1995 at Hardcore Heaven after Raven and Richards successfully defended the ECW Tag Team Championship against Dreamer and Vachon, The Pitbulls left Raven&#x27;s Nest, with The Dudley Brothers replacing them shortly thereafter. At Heat Wave on July 15, 1995, Dreamer and The Pitbulls defeated Raven and The Dudley Brothers. Later that evening, Dreamer handcuffed Raven and delivered a chair shot later dubbed &quot;the chair shot heard &#x27;round the world.&quot; The footage of the chair shot was incorporated into the title sequence of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot;. At Wrestlepalooza on August 5, 1995, during an eight-man tag team match, Raven, Richards and the Dudley Brothers defeated Tommy Dreamer, Cactus Jack and the Pitbulls after Cactus Jack, Dreamer&#x27;s long-time ally, turned on him, joining Raven&#x27;s Nest. On September 16, 1995 at Gangstas Paradise, Raven and Richards lost the ECW World Tag Team Championship to The Pitbulls following interference from Dreamer. Raven and Richards regained the titles from The Pitbulls on October 7, 1995 at South Philly Jam, only to lose them to The Public Enemy later that evening. At November to Remember on November 18, 1995, Dreamer and Terry Funk defeated Raven and Cactus Jack in the main event. At the same event, Raven&#x27;s Nest received a new member, The Blue Meanie, who became a lackey to Stevie Richards.

At December to Dismember on December 9, 1995, Raven once more defeated Dreamer, although later that night Dreamer, The Pitbulls and The Public Enemy defeated Raven, Richards, The Eliminators and The Heavenly Bodies in an &quot;Ultimate Jeopardy&quot; cage match when Dreamer pinned Richards. At Holiday Hell on December 30, 1995, Raven defeated Dreamer to become number one contender for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent champion The Sandman later that evening. At the same event, The Dudley Brothers left Raven&#x27;s Nest following a confrontation with Richards. During the build-up to the match, Raven further expounded on his grudge against Dreamer, accusing Dreamer of not having been there for him during his parents&#x27; divorce, an accusation that Dreamer hotly denied. At House Party on January 5, 1996, Richards attempted to kiss McGillicutty, who refused, eventually announcing that she was pregnant. After Raven angrily confronted McGillicutty, she informed him that he was not the father, causing Raven to attack Richards. McGillicutty then revealed that Tommy Dreamer was the father, with Dreamer storming the ring and beating down Raven, Richards and The Blue Meanie before embracing Beulah.

==== ECW World Heavyweight Champion (1996–1997) ====
On January 27, 1996, Raven introduced his new girlfriend, Kimona Wanalaya. Later that evening, Raven defeated The Sandman to win his first ECW World Heavyweight Championship following extensive interference from Raven&#x27;s Nest. Over the following months, Raven successfully defended the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in bouts with opponents including Shane Douglas, Pitbull #2, Chris Jericho, Damián 666, 2 Cold Scorpio and Terry Gordy. Wanalaya left him in April 1996 at Massacre on Queens Boulevard after he slapped her.

At Hardcore Heaven on June 22, 1996, Raven began playing mind games with The Sandman, brainwashing his ex-wife, Lori and his son, Tyler to join Raven&#x27;s Nest. Lori and Tyler subsequently began accompanying Raven to ringside for his matches, with Raven using him to wage psychological warfare against The Sandman over the following months.

At High Incident on October 26, 1996, Richards was involved in one of ECW&#x27;s most controversial angles, with Raven&#x27;s Nest &quot;crucifying&quot; The Sandman by tying him to a cross and placing a crown made of barbed wire on his head. The angle, which was widely criticised as being in poor taste, led to Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle severing his links with ECW and delayed the promotion&#x27;s debut on pay-per-view. At the instruction of Paul Heyman, Raven came to the ring and offered a somewhat insincere apology for his actions.

The relationship between Raven and Richards began to deteriorate in late 1996. At Ultimate Jeopardy on October 5, 1996, Raven was scheduled to team with Brian Lee against Dreamer and The Sandman in a match with Raven&#x27;s ECW World Heavyweight Championship on the line. After Raven was announced as being unable to compete, Richards substituted for him, with Raven losing his title after The Sandman pinned Richards. Upon his return, Raven blamed Richards for the loss. At Holiday Hell on December 7, 1996, Raven defeated The Sandman in a barbed wire match to regain the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Despite this, the tension between Raven and Richards continued to build until, on December 28, 1996, Richards turned on Raven by superkicking him during a match with The Sandman. Richards, The Blue Meanie and Super Nova subsequently broke away from Raven.

At the Crossing the Line Again event on February 1, 1997, Raven successfully defended the ECW World Heavyweight Championship against &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams – inflicting Williams&#x27; first loss in the United States in a decade – after interference from Richards backfired. As part of an agreement between ECW and the World Wrestling Federation, Raven and several other ECW wrestlers appeared on the February 24, 1997 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, with Raven confronting Richards.

Over the following months, Raven successfully defended the ECW World Heavyweight Championship against opponents including Dreamer, Richards, Rob Van Dam and Super Nova. His reign lasted until April 13, 1997, when he was defeated by Terry Funk in the main event of Barely Legal, ECW&#x27;s first pay-per-view.

On the May 1, 1997 episode of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot;, a controversial angle took place in which a morose Raven, despondent at the loss of his title and other setbacks, confronted Richards, telling him he had one final &quot;mission&quot; for him. Raven then attacked Richards before begging him to &quot;end my pain&quot;. At The Buffalo Invasion on May 11, 1997, Raven and Richards reformed their tag team to face Dreamer and Funk, with Richards pinning Funk despite bickering with Raven throughout the match. In the main event, Raven, Richards, Funk and The Sandman faced one another in a four-way elimination match for Funk&#x27;s ECW World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Raven DDT&#x27;ed both Funk and The Sandman and then demanded that Richards pin them and then lay down for him. Richards refused, instead superkicking Raven and enabling Funk and The Sandman to pin him.

At Wrestlepalooza on June 6, 1997, Raven faced Dreamer in a &quot;Loser Leaves ECW&quot; match. During the bout, Raven abandoned his new valet, Chastity, and unsuccessfully begged Beulah to take him back. Dreamer ultimately won the match by pinning Raven for the first time, marking the end of their lengthy feud and the end of Raven&#x27;s ECW career. Raven subsequently left ECW and rejoined World Championship Wrestling.

=== Return to WCW (1997–1999) ===

==== The Flock (1997–1998) ====

On June 30, 1997, Levy made his return to WCW as Raven. He was seen sitting in the front row at &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; where the commentators acknowledged him as &quot;a man who has been a champion with other organizations&quot;. On August 21, 1997 at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXV&quot;, Raven defeated Stevie Richards in an &quot;unsanctioned&quot; match and then took a seat in the front row. The storyline continued that Raven would frequently appear in the front row for the next few months with his lackeys, slowly forming what would be known as The Flock. Raven was an &quot;unsigned free agent&quot;, but eventually accepted a contract with WCW Commissioner J. J. Dillon which stipulated that he could wrestle only when he wanted and under his own rules. The Flock was a stable of s in the same vein as the Raven&#x27;s Nest group in ECW. With The Flock, however, Raven was more openly abusive and controlling, which eventually led to dissension and rebellion. The group&#x27;s matches were held under &quot;Raven&#x27;s Rules&quot;, which meant no disqualifications—weapon usage, double teaming, and outside interference were rampant.

Raven made his in-ring &quot;Nitro&quot; debut on October 27 against Scotty Riggs, after Riggs refused an invitation to join The Flock. Raven won the match, during which he performed a drop toehold on Riggs that drove his face into a steel chair and temporarily blinded him in one eye. The two engaged in a brief feud which resulted in a match at World War 3 in November, where Raven defeated Riggs and inducted him by force into The Flock.

With The Flock&#x27;s help, Raven won the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship which lasted only a day as Raven defeated Diamond Dallas Page at Spring Stampede and lost the belt the following night to Bill Goldberg on &quot;Nitro&quot;. He blamed The Flock and Saturn in particular for his loss. This led to a series of matches, culminating in a match at Fall Brawl that if Raven lost, The Flock would be able to disband. Saturn won with the help of Kidman, who also wanted to leave Raven&#x27;s abuses.

==== The Dead Pool (1998–1999) ====

Without The Flock, Raven began a series of depressing interviews and walked out on several matches. In October at Halloween Havoc, Raven refused to wrestle Chris Jericho for the WCW Television Championship, but eventually was convinced to return to the ring which he lost the match and was not seen until 1999. On his return, a series of vignettes were shown in which a camera crew followed Raven to his supposed childhood home, where he had led a privileged upper class lifestyle. He was also reunited with his former valet Chastity, who WCW claimed was his sister. He teamed with Perry Saturn, winning the WCW Tag Team Championship at 1999 Slamboree, losing the belts to the debuting The Jersey Triad three weeks later.

He later joined with Vampiro and the Insane Clown Posse in a short-lived stable called The Dead Pool. In a backstage meeting in August 1999, which involved every contracted WCW wrestler, Eric Bischoff offered anyone their release right then and there. Levy was the only one to stand up and walk out, as he was dissatisfied with WCW&#x27;s creative direction. Levy was granted his release and left the company.

=== Return to ECW (1999–2000) ===
As a condition to leaving WCW, Levy was not allowed to directly join the WWF upon leaving the promotion as levied by a no compete clause in his contract. Via a loophole in the contract, Levy rejoined ECW and signed a one-year contract on August 25, 1999. The next night, Raven made a surprise return at the Last Show at the Madhouse, which was televised on ECW&#x27;s debut on TNN, winning the tag team title from the departing The Dudley Boyz along with Tommy Dreamer on August 26, 1999. A reluctant tag team, Raven and Dreamer reigned as ECW World Tag Team Champions for several months. When they lost the belts, they feuded briefly. Raven and Mike Awesome won the tag team title from Tanaka and Dreamer on March 4, 2000, only to lose them a week later to The Impact Players at Living Dangerously. CyberSlam 2000 was Raven&#x27;s last ECW appearance with Francine, as she aligned with Justin Credible that evening. In his last televised match (July 15, 2000) Raven challenged ECW TV champion Rhino. His in-ring appearances were initially limited by a recent surgery to repair a rotator cuff tear. Shortly thereafter, he departed for the WWF.

=== Return to WWF/E (2000–2003) ===

Levy returned to the WWF, as Raven, in 2000 at Unforgiven when he interfered in the strap match between Tazz and Jerry Lawler by hitting Lawler with a DDT. His previous run in the WWF as Johnny Polo was ignored by the company. He then started teaming with Tazz before they went their separate ways. Raven feuded with Jerry Lawler that fall until January 2001. He then moved on to the Hardcore division, where he would often bring out a shopping cart full of trash cans and other potential weapons during his entrances. On December 22, 2000 in Chattanooga, he defeated Steve Blackman for the Hardcore Championship, his first of a record 27 title reigns, though most of Raven&#x27;s title reigns were short-lived. The Hardcore title at the time was contested under the &quot;24/7&quot; defense rule, leading to segments where one wrestler would win the title only to immediately lose it to another wrestler. At WrestleMania X-Seven, he competed in his only WrestleMania match, losing the Hardcore Championship to Kane in a triple threat match that also included Big Show. At Backlash, he lost to Hardcore Champion Rhyno in a hardcore match. A brief angle had an anonymous Black Ninja, who was later revealed to be his old valet from his Pacific Northwest days, Tori, aiding Raven in retaining the Hardcore Championship.

When the Invasion storyline began, he found himself in the new WCW/ECW Alliance. His most notable storyline during this time was when he was managed by Terri Runnels and destroyed the love interest of Saturn, his mop called &quot;Moppy&quot;. He also started teaming with Justin Credible in late July 2001. By the end of the year, Raven was not seen on WWF programs, as the Alliance lost the &quot;Winner Take All&quot; match at Survivor Series.

In March 2002, when the WWF brand extension was announced, Raven was drafted to Raw. On the final &quot;SmackDown!&quot; before the split began, he defeated Maven to once again win the Hardcore Championship, thus bringing the title to &quot;Raw&quot;. He lost the title that Monday to Bubba Ray Dudley. At that time, Levy decided to spend some time announcing, and Raven became the new color commentator for &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; and &quot;Excess&quot;. This role lasted a couple of months, as he later quit the show to resume his wrestling career on &quot;Raw&quot;. This did not last long either, as he was &quot;banished&quot; from &quot;Raw&quot; after losing a match to former ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer on June 24, 2002. Raven was forced to spend the rest of the year on &quot;Heat&quot;. Although he won his way back onto the &quot;Raw&quot; roster, he lost to Jeff Hardy in a Royal Rumble qualifier match, which was his final match in the WWE. He was released from the promotion the following week on January 20, 2003.

=== NWA Total Nonstop Action / Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2010) ===

==== The Gathering (2003–2004) ====

Raven debuted for NWA Total Nonstop Action (TNA) on January 22, 2003, two days after his release from WWE, attacking and hitting his finisher on Jeff Jarrett and stealing the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from him. Raven then embarked upon a long-running storyline in which he claimed it was his &quot;destiny&quot; to win the NWA World Heavyweight Title. Raven began playing mind games with the roster, starting with his former nemesis Sandman, and debuted his trademark &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; House of Fun match, which Levy devised himself. On April 30, 2003 Raven got his first shot at Jarrett&#x27;s NWA World Heavyweight Championship, yet Jarrett won the match.

On September 17, 2003, Raven lost his trademark long hair after he was defeated by Shane Douglas in a hair versus hair match, thanks to the surprise interference of Vampiro. Vampiro and Raven would grow to be bitter rivals which resulted in a backstage brawl which Vampiro ended up with a torn &quot;ACL.&quot; While in TNA, he formed a stable known as The Gathering, which included ROH rival CM Punk, as well as Julio Dinero and Alexis Laree, though they would later turn on him. He created matches involving old friends and brought in former colleagues from ECW such as New Jack, Perry Saturn, Mikey Whipwreck, and Justin Credible, all of whom Raven beat in matches. Later in the year these superstars overturned Sports Entertainment Xtreme (SEX). In 2003, Raven feuded with James Mitchell and the Disciples of the New Church. Raven took them all out one by one just like he said, but with interferences from The Gathering and ECW counterparts. Raven ended his feud with James Mitchell in a Last Man Standing match, which was won by Raven. This led to a long undefeated run and the beginning of Raven&#x27;s attempts to fulfill his destiny. In 2004, Raven teamed up with The Sandman to go against The Gathering. The Gathering won due to interference from James Mitchell, who had aligned himself with The Gathering. Raven then teamed with Terry Funk to defeat the Gathering, even though James Mitchell tried to interfere.

Also in 2004, Raven&#x27;s old friend Sabu returned to TNA. Raven teamed with Sabu to defeat The Gathering one last time. Raven and Sabu then feuded with Abyss and &quot;The Alpha Male&quot; Monty Brown. Abyss and Brown outnumbered Sabu on many occasions, when Raven failed to watch Sabu&#x27;s back. Raven waged a campaign against Sabu, disrespecting the memory of his uncle and assaulting Sabu&#x27;s mouthpiece, Sonjay Dutt, until Sabu finally broke and attacked him on July 23. Raven defeated Sabu in a No Holds Barred match on August 4, and a scheduled return match on August 18 was canceled after Sabu suffered a legitimate back injury. He also competed in the very first Monster&#x27;s Ball match, with Abyss and Brown.

==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (2005–2006) ====
On June 19, 2005, Raven turned face and fulfilled his self-proclaimed destiny when he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary (by taking Jeff Jarrett&#x27;s place after Jarrett attacked a fan from the crowd earlier that night and got arrested), defeating A.J. Styles, Abyss, Sean Waltman and Monty Brown in a five way King of the Mountain match. He successfully defended the title in two defenses over the following months against Abyss at No Surrender, and Rhino two months later at Unbreakable. Against Rhino he showed his full array of moves and peeled back the years looking like the Raven in ECW and early WCW. He not only defeated Rhino but hit a Raven Effect DDT on Jeff Jarrett, with the assistance of Jeff Hardy running to the ringside. He also had a tag team match with Sabu against Jeff Jarrett and Rhino.

On September 15, Raven lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Jeff Jarrett in Oldcastle, Ontario, Canada, at a special event of Border City Wrestling. America&#x27;s Most Wanted (&quot;Wildcat&quot; Chris Harris and &quot;Cowboy&quot; James Storm) came out and interfered on Jarrett&#x27;s behalf. BCW officials immediately contacted TNA Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko, who declared the title change official (TNA had briefly gone dark on its national television timeslot prior to jumping to Spike TV, prompting a title change in another NWA based promotion). This led to Raven feuding with Larry Zbyszko, who brought in wrestlers like PJ Polaco and Chris K to wrestle Raven. This culminated in a match at Final Resolution where Raven wrestled Sean Waltman with the stipulation that if Raven lost he would have to leave TNA. Raven lost the match and went on hiatus as a result.

Raven returned to TNA on April 23, 2006 at the Lockdown pay-per-view, and reignited his feud with Zbyszko. They would end their feud at Victory Road in a Hair vs. Hair match which Raven won.

==== Serotonin (2006–2008) ====

He next feuded with Abyss and Brother Runt, losing to the former in a Hangman&#x27;s Horror match on Impact after the latter turned on him. Subsequent to this, his coverage in major televised angles has dropped considerably. While he was off-air, an alliance was teased between Kazarian, Johnny Devine, and Matt Bentley. On the TNA Primetime Special before Genesis, the three came out in goth, addressing a new movement in TNA. After a loss at Genesis, sporting a new look (often with a mask), Raven revealed himself as their leader, caning the loser of the match. This stable became known as Serotonin. The direction of this stable was very hard to place, although they lost the majority of their televised matches. Regardless of the outcome, Raven would hit the Serotonin competitor with a cane. After a long hiatus, Raven returned to the ring, losing to Christopher Daniels in a First Blood Invitational then losing to Chris Harris after interference from Kaz. On &quot;Impact&quot;, Raven came out after Kaz&#x27;s win over Havok and Martyr and hit Kaz in the back with a Kendo Stick, breaking it over Kaz&#x27;s back. Raven, Havok, and Martyr then attacked Kaz with kendo sticks. On the July 19 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Raven and the rest of Serotonin took on the reuniting Triple X. Raven had very little time in the match and Serotonin lost after Skipper hit a diving leg drop, Daniels hit a Best Moonsault Ever, and Senshi hit a Warrior&#x27;s Way on Havok.

Raven won a House of Fun match, on the August 9 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. He teamed with Robert Roode and James Storm against the team of Chris Harris, Rhino, and Kazarian. Raven lost to Kaz, who had rebelled against him, at Hard Justice despite having the remaining members of Serotonin involve themselves in the match. He then issued a challenge to Abyss and Rhino at Bound for Glory. Abyss later had Black Reign added to the match and made it a Monsters Ball. Raven briefly formed an alliance with Havok, Black Reign, Judas Mesias, and James Mitchell with the purpose of defeating Abyss. At Bound for glory, Raven would go on to lose the match after Abyss gave him a black hole slam on to tacks and glass. On the November 15 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Havok was revealed to be Team 3D&#x27;s X Division traitor, effectively ending Serotonin. At Turning Point, Raven substituted for Rhino in the &quot;Match of 10,000 Thumbtacks&quot; and teamed with Abyss to defeat Black Reign and Rellik. Raven was officially released from TNA, and his profile was removed from the roster on March 7, 2008.

==== Alliance with Dr. Stevie; EV 2.0 (2009–2010) ====

After an absence of more than a year, Raven surprised fans by returning to TNA on May 28, 2009. He returned as a heel by attacking Abyss with a Kendo stick with Dr. Stevie assisting him. He then aligned himself with Dr. Stevie and Daffney. On the June 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; he won a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match against Jethro Holliday. At Slammiversary, Abyss and Taylor Wilde defeated Raven and Daffney in the first-ever mixed tag team Monster&#x27;s Ball match. After the pay-per-view, Raven&#x27;s name was taken down from the TNA website.

On the November 12, 2009, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Raven returned again to TNA attacking Abyss and throwing a fireball at Mick Foley&#x27;s face, aligning himself again with Dr. Stevie and Daffney. At Final Resolution, Abyss and Foley defeated Stevie and Raven in a &quot;Foley&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; tag team match. Raven appeared on the January 4 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, teaming with Dr. Stevie in a number one contender&#x27;s tag team match, where they were defeated by Matt Morgan and Hernandez. He appeared on the February 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, helping Eric Bischoff take out Abyss, along with Rhino, Homicide, Tomko, and Desmond Wolfe.

Raven returned to television four months later on the June 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; showing signs of a face turn, appearing in the Impact! Zone crowd beside Stevie Richards and Tommy Dreamer. The following week the three were joined by Rhino. On the July 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Raven, Dreamer, Richards, Rhino, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Al Snow, led by Mick Foley, aligned themselves with the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam by attacking Abyss and the rest of the TNA locker room. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay–per–view event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company. On the July 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Raven re–ignited his old feud with Dreamer by turning on him, after his match with Abyss, and laying him out with a DDT on a chair and in doing so, turned heel. The following week, Raven explained his turn by saying that he had not forgotten how Dreamer had &quot;stolen&quot;, and later married, his girlfriend Beulah McGillicutty, who turned on Raven back in 1996 during his and Dreamer&#x27;s initial feud. On August 8 at Hardcore Justice Raven defeated Dreamer in a &quot;Final Showdown&quot; match refereed by Mick Foley. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni, known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they didn&#x27;t deserve to be in TNA, thus once again turning Raven face. At Bound for Glory, Raven, Dreamer, Rhino, Richards and Sabu defeated members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match. At Turning Point, EV 2.0 faced Fortune in a ten-man tag team match, where each member of EV 2.0 put their TNA careers on the line. In the end, EV 2.0 lost the match and Sabu was released from TNA. Two weeks later on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Raven was forced to put his TNA future on the line in a match against the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Hardy. Hardy won the match and as a result Raven was released from TNA. His release from the company was legitimate. Raven worked one last match for the promotion on November 12, 2010, defeating TNA Television Champion A.J. Styles in a non–title match at the &quot;Farewell at the Asylum&quot; live event.

=== Independent circuit and semi-retirement (2008–present) ===
In 2008, Raven appeared in Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW) for Season 2 of SlamTV!. In the main event of the second episode, JCW Heavyweight Champion Corporal Robinson put his title on the line against Sexy Slim Goody. When Robinson attempted to hit the Boot Camp, the lights shut off in the arena. When they turned back on, Raven appeared in the ring and hit Robinson with his Evenflow DDT, before stealing the JCW Heavyweight Championship belt. In the third episode, Raven introduced Sexy Slim Goody as his newest lackey. When Robinson ran out to the ring to take his title back, Sexy Slim Goody (kayfabe) knocked him out with a steel chair shot, and Raven began to shave Robinson&#x27;s afro. Sabu appeared from out of the crowd and scared Raven off, leaving Robinson with a half shaved afro. The tag team of Raven and Sexy Slim Goody had a match against Corporal Robinson and Sabu in the following episode. Raven walked out on the match with the stolen championship belt, fleeing from Sabu. At &quot;Bloodymania II&quot;, Raven lost to Corporal Robinson in a &quot;Loser leaves JCW&quot; Ladder match. However, Raven returned to the company at Bloodymania III in a losing effort against his old nemesis Sabu in a Raven&#x27;s Rules match.

Levy was the heavyweight champion of CWA Pro Wrestling, an independent professional wrestling promotion based out of Orangeburg, South Carolina, from March 15 through August 8, 2008. He won the championship when he defeated Timber in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 15. He was stripped of the title after missing several shows, therefore not being able to defend the championship. Levy was also featured doing shows overseas at Russia&#x27;s Independent Wrestling Federation, battling Joe Legend.

On October 27, Raven appeared for Niagara Falls, Ontario-based promotion Busted Knuckle Pro Wrestling&#x27;s Apocalypse event, defeating Eddie Osborne in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match. During the match, Raven threw out his shoulder while performing a DDT, but still finished the match, despite being hit with several chair shots and even going through a table after the DDT was performed. After the match, he cut a promo putting over all of the young stars in the promotion as well as Osborne, congratulating the promotion on doing a great job so far in his eyes. On November 11 at Extreme Rising, Raven took on Stevie Richards in a loser leaves town match which ended in a no contest.

== Personal life ==
Levy possesses an IQ of 143 and is a member of Mensa and the Theta Chi fraternity. He suffers from type 2 diabetes, and has also been diagnosed with borderline, histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder. Levy married in January 2007, but announced on Twitter in March 2013 that he and his wife had divorced.

Levy is a lifelong fan of comic books. In &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot;&#x27;s May 1999 issue, Levy is quoted as saying

I love the Marvel Knights line. I&#x27;m a big Kevin Smith fan, and his work on &quot;Daredevil&quot; is the best on that book since Frank Miller&#x27;s stuff. &quot;Inhumans&quot; is also great. It could be the break-out book of the year because they&#x27;re finally treating them as real characters instead of just freaks and monsters with no personality.

The article goes on to say that he is a big fan of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, and especially &quot;Sandman&quot; and that he has a tattoo of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s Sandman character (Dream) on his back. Levy, along with Brian Azzarello, wrote Issue #14 of &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s Tangled Web&quot;, entitled &quot;The Last Shoot&quot;. The comic was based around the professional wrestler (named Crusher Hogan) who Peter Parker defeated in the character&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot;. He also provided a cover quote for a trade paperback edition of &quot;100 Bullets&quot;.

Levy, along with former colleague Chris Kanyon and colleague Mike Sanders, attempted to sue World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for &quot;cheating them out of health care and other benefits&quot;, but a federal judge in Stamford, Connecticut dismissed the case. In a 2010 interview Levy explained that the case was dismissed due to statute of limitations running out.

<doc id="307535" wikidata="Q207432" url="?curid=307535" title="Chandrika Kumaratunga">
<text>Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga (; ; born 29 June 1945), commonly referred to by her initials CBK, is a Sri Lankan politician who served as the fifth President of Sri Lanka from 12 November 1994 to 19 November 2005. Prior to her presidency, she was the Prime Minister from August to November 1994 and the chief minister of the Western Province from 1993 to 1994. Kumaratunga is the country&#x27;s first and only female president to date and the second female prime minister. She led the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) from 1994 to 2005.

She is the longest-serving president in Sri Lankan history. She was elected in 1994, defeating UNP candidate Srima Dissanayake in the largest landslide victory in Sri Lankan history, securing 62% of the votes. Kumaratunga was reelected in 1999, defeating UNP candidate and Leader of the Opposition, Ranil Wickremesinghe.

==Early life and family==

Chandrika Bandaranaike was born on 29 June 1945, at Wentworth in Guildford Crescent, Colombo to Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike and Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike. The family moved the year later to a mansion at Rosmead Place, Colombo purchased by her paternal grandfather.

Her father S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was an Oxford educated barrister who was the Minister of Local Administration at the time of her birth. A nationalist and left-wing politician, who had by the time built up a strong following known as the Sinhala Maha Sabha. He was the only son of Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranike, the Maha Mudaliyar, the chief Ceylonese representative and advisor to the Governor of Ceylon. Her mother Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike was the daughter of Barnes Ratwatte Dissawa, Rate Mahatmaya of Balangoda during British colonial rule, who was descended from Ratwatte Dissawa, Dissawa of Matale, a signatory on behalf of the Sinhalese to the Kandyan Convention of 1815.

Kumaratunga was born into the prominent Bandaranaike family and spent her early years at their residence in Rosmead Place, Colombo, as well as at Horagolla Walauwa, her family&#x27;s ancestral home. Her father, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, played a significant role in Sri Lanka’s early post-independence politics, serving as the country’s first Cabinet Minister of Health and Local Government in 1948. In 1951, he broke away from the governing party to establish the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), shaping the political landscape of the country. Contesting the elections that followed and strengthening the SLFP in the periods between elections; Bandaranaike became the Leader of the Opposition in 1952 and prime minister in 1956. As prime minister, he was responsible for putting forth significant reforms such as the nationalization of bus companies and the Port of Colombo, a prohibition on caste-based discrimination, the removal of British military bases, and the establishment of diplomatic missions with a number of Communist states. He also made Sinhala the country&#x27;s only official language, thus marginalizing the Tamils as well as members of the middle-class educated elite whose first language was English. He was subsequently assassinated in 1959 when Chandrika was fourteen. Following this in 1959, his widow, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, assumed leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). In the 1960 general election, she led the party to victory, becoming the world&#x27;s first female prime minister. Therefore, Chandrika was involved in politics from a young age along with her siblings as she was the second of three children in the family. Her elder sister Sunethra Bandaranaike became a socialite and her younger brother Anura Bandaranaike joined active politics, going on to become a cabinet minister and Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka as well as the youngest leader of the opposition.

==Education==
Chandrika was educated at the St Bridget&#x27;s Convent, Colombo, and enrolled at the Roman Catholic Aquinas University College, Colombo to study for a law degree. However, in 1967, she left Aquinas for France without completing her law studies, on a scholarship from the Institute of French Studies. There she spent one year at the Institut d&#x27;études politiques d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence following a course in the French language and culture. In 1968, she went on to study at the Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) graduating with a diploma in political science in 1970. She thereafter enrolled in a PhD program in development economics at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, Paris, where she studied from 1970 to 1973. She is fluent in Sinhala, English and French.

==Early political career==
She returned to Ceylon in 1972, where her mother had become prime minister for the second time in 1970 and launched a wide-ranging programme of socialist reform, and faced a violent communist insurrection in 1971. After returning she enrolled in and became active in the SLFP which had been founded by her father and now led by her mother. In 1974, she became an executive committee member of its Women&#x27;s League.

She was appointed as an Additional Principal Director in the Land Reforms Commission (LRC) which acquired nearly 228,000 hectares of private land to the state under the Land Reform Law, which imposed a ceiling of twenty hectares on privately owned land. Leaving the LRC in 1976, she became the chairman of the Janawasa Commission, which established collective farms from land acquired by the LRC. Following the defeat of her mother&#x27;s SLFP government in the 1977 general election, she left government service and acted as a consultant to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations till 1979.

===Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya===
In 1978, she married Vijaya Kumaratunga a leading actor, and LSSP turned SLFP political activist. She supported his election campaign in the by-election in Mahara in 1983, where he lost in the recount. She left the SLFP in 1984 when Vijaya Kumaratunga formed his own party the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya (SLMP) supporting his political activities against the policies of the mainstream parties. She served as the vice president of the SLMP. This resulted in her falling out with her mother and brother who were leading the SLFP at the time. On 16 February 1988, Vijaya Kumaratunga was assassinated in front of his home in Narahenpita by gunmen in the presence of his wife. Chandrika Kumaratunga briefly took over the leadership of her husband&#x27;s party, and formed the United Socialist Alliance with the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, and the Nava Sama Samaja Party. Although it was well organized, it lacked votes. Fearing for her life, she soon fled the country in 1988, seeking refuge in the United Kingdom. There she worked for World Institute for Development Economics Research at the United Nations University.

===Return to politics===
Following the end of the second JVP insurrection, Chandrika began visiting Sri Lanka in 1990 and re-engaging politics. In September 1991, the governing United National Party which had been dominating the political landscape was greatly weakened when Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake left the UNP and formed the Democratic United National Front following a failed impeachment against President Ranasinghe Premadasa. DUNF soon mobilized the opposition against the Premadasa government. Having returned permanently in 1991, Chandrika rejoined SLFP and got actively involved in politics. In 1993, Athulathmudali and Premadasa were assassinated. Following Athulathmudali&#x27;s assassination, Chandrika became the principal opposition candidate in the Western provincial council election, in which she was elected as the Chief Minister of the Western Province on 21 May 1993.

==Premiership (1994)==
With general elections called for in 1994, she became the de facto leader of the SLFP forming a coalition called the People&#x27;s Alliance, which contested the general elections. In the election, Chandrika was elected to parliament from the Gampaha District in August 1994. Achieving a slim majority in parliament by gaining the support of the Ceylon Workers&#x27; Congress, the PA formed a government with Chandrika as prime minister with her mother as a minister in the cabinet on 19 August 1994. She also succeeded her mother as the leader of the SLFP. Soon thereafter presidential elections were called for in November.

==Presidency (1994–2005)==
===First term (1994–1999)===
Prime Minister Kumaratunga backed by the PA contested against Gamini Dissanayake, who was the leader of the opposition backed by the UNP. However, Dissanayake was soon assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber and his widow Srima Dissanayake took over his nomination. Chandrika won the presidential election in 1994 gaining 62.28% of the vote. Becoming the first female president of Sri Lanka in November 1994, she appointed her mother to succeed her as prime minister.

===Economic policy===
Her government continued the open economic policies of the UNP, with an increase in the major revenue earners; the apparel industry, foreign remittances from migrant unskilled labor, and tea exports. Much of her major economic projects failed and the country was in recession by 2001.

She privatized several state corporations such as Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, State Distilleries Corporation, Air Lanka among others which were found to be controversial with Kumaratunga accused of taking large bribes for the sales and years later the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka annulled several such sales. She was fined by the court a sum of three million rupees for unlawful land acquisition and subsequent sale of such land for the Water&#x27;s Edge development project.

She further followed a policy of strong prosecution of UNP, by appointing presidential committees to investigate actions of the UNP tenure and leading members of the opposition personally such as the leader of the opposition, Ranil Wickremasinghe. Her administration was criticized for its attacks and intimidation of journalists; rigged elections and in 2000 in the run-up to the elections tried to arrest and imprison her main political opponent Wickremasinghe.

===Civil War===
Early in her term, she made conciliatory moves toward the separatist Tamil Tigers (LTTE) in an attempt to end the ongoing civil war. These overtures failed, when the LTTE broke the cease-fire and blew up two Sri Lanka Navy gunboats known as SLNS &quot;Sooraya&quot; and SLNS &quot;Ranasuru&quot; on 19 April 1995. She thereafter pursued a more military-based strategy against them launching several major offensives such as Operation Riviresa which captured the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE. However, she suffered a major set back due to the Battle of Mullaitivu in 1996 and Battle of Kilinochchi in 1998. Her government thereafter launched Operation Jayasikurui which soon bogged down with heavy casualties.

===Foreign policy===

Her government, led by Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar increased the recognition and acceptance of Sri Lanka on the international stage, which had been greatly affected by the riots and suppression of insurgency in the 1980s. She succeeded in having the LTTE banned internationally; with the United States and the United Kingdom proscribed the LTTE on 8 October 1997 and 28 February 2001 respectively, thereby depriving that organization of a primary source of funding. Her government re-established formal diplomatic ties with Israel in 2000, which had become a major supplier of weapons to the island.

===Second term (1999–2005)===
In October 1999, Kumaratunga called an early presidential election. She lost vision in her right eye (permanent optic nerve damage) in an assassination attempt, by the Tamil Tigers, at her final election rally at Colombo Town Hall premises on 18 December 1999. She managed to defeat Ranil Wickremasinghe in the election held on 21 December and was sworn in for another term the next day.

Her second term saw the civil war aggravating with her government suffering major defeats against the LTTE such as the Second Battle of Elephant Pass and Bandaranaike Airport attack.

;UNP Government 2001–2004
In December 2001, her party the People&#x27;s Alliance lost the parliamentary election to the UNP, and her political opponent, Ranil Wickremasinghe, became Sri Lanka&#x27;s new prime minister. She continued as president of Sri Lanka although her relationship with the Wickremasinghe government was a strained one.

In February 2002 Wickremasinghe&#x27;s government and the LTTE signed a permanent ceasefire agreement, paving the way for talks to end the long-running conflict. In December, the government and the rebels agreed to share power during peace talks in Norway. President Kumaratunga believed Wickremasinghe was being too lenient towards the LTTE, and in May 2003 she indicated her willingness to sack the prime minister and government if she felt they were making too many concessions to the rebels. On 4 November 2003, while Prime Minister Wickremasinghe was on an official visit to the US, Kumaratunga prorogued Parliament and took over Defense, Interior, and Media ministries herself. Her opponents criticized her, calling her behavior dictatorial.

;UPFA Government 2004–2005
Kumaratunga&#x27;s PA and the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna or JVP (People&#x27;s Liberation Front) formed the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in January 2004 and dissolved Parliament. Having won the election held on 2 April 2004 the UPFA formed a government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister. This marked the first time in history that the JVP became a partner in a Sri Lankan government. However, in June 2005, the JVP left Kumaratunga&#x27;s government over a disagreement regarding a joint mechanism with LTTE rebels sharing foreign aid to rebuild the tsunami-devastated Northern and Eastern areas of Sri Lanka.

Kumaratunga&#x27;s six-year term ended that year in 2005. She argued that since the 1999 election had been held one year early, she should be allowed to serve that leftover year stating that she had a secret swearing-in for her second term a year after her formal swearing-in. The Supreme Court rejected this stating that her term ended in 2005.

In the presidential elections that followed, Mahinda Rajapaksa gained 50.29% and succeeded her as president, leading all 25 parties in the UPFA. She was listed 25th by Forbes magazine in its &quot;100 most powerful women&quot; in 2005.

==Post-presidency==
In 2006, having remained the leader of the SLFP after leaving office, she &quot;temporally&quot; stepped down from the party leadership citing &quot;continuous harassment she has faced after Mahinda Rajapaksa took office as president&quot; and soon after left the country for self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom.

Kumaratunga is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders and the Global Leadership Foundation. In November 2009, Kumaratunga was appointed to the 12-member board of directors of the Club de Madrid. She is a frequent panelist and member of the Clinton Global Initiative and advisor to its annual meeting held every September.

Kumaratunga noted in 2007: ″I sincerely tried to reach a political consensus to solve the ethnic question, and tried to introduce a pluralistic constitution that would cater to the political aspirations of the Tamil people without dividing the country.″ In September 2009, Kumaratunga, on a personal visit to Kerala, India told reporters
&quot;I too care for my life. Even though the current government is a government of my party (Sri Lanka Freedom Party) I don&#x27;t feel safe.&quot; She continued, &quot;There is an overall lack of freedom and an atmosphere of fear prevails in the country. The basic rights of the people and media freedom are restricted in Sri Lanka.&quot; In February 2017, Kumaratunga accepted an invitation to join the eminent international Council of Patrons of the Asian University for Women (AUW) in Chittagong, Bangladesh.

===2015 Sri Lankan presidential election===
On 21 November 2014 Kumaratunga formally announced her return to active politics at a press conference held by the country&#x27;s opposition coalition, following weeks of speculation regarding her involvement in the coalition&#x27;s decision-making. She successfully endorsed Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate of the opposition in the 2015 presidential election, who defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa. In the same year, Kumaratunga supported the United National Party in the general elections to avoid Rajapaksa becoming prime minister. In 2015 she was appointed as the chairperson of office for national unity and reconciliation to overlook national unity in Sri Lanka.

===2018 Maldivian presidential election===
In the aftermath of the 2018 Maldivian presidential election it was revealed that Kumaratunga was instrumental in forming the opposition alliance against the incumbent President Abdulla Yameen. Kumaratunga coordinated with opposition leaders both in the Maldives and in Sri Lanka bridging trust between the disputing opposition parties to form a coalition.

===2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis===
During the 2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis, Kumaratunga remained silent and she later claimed that she was not invited to the special convention of the SLFP on 4 December 2018.

===2019 Sri Lankan presidential election===
Kumaratunga endorsed Sajith Premadasa for the 2019 Sri Lankan presidential election.

==Personal life==
Chandrika married actor and politician Vijaya Kumaratunga in 1978, who was assassinated on 16 February 1988, outside his residence in the presence of Chandrika and their two children, then aged five and seven.

Their daughter, Yasodhara Kumaratunga born in 1980 and educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and at St George&#x27;s, University of London became a medical doctor and married Roger Walker a consultant medical practitioner from Dorset. Their son, Vimukthi Kumaratunga born in 1982 and educated at the University of Bristol became a veterinary surgeon.

<doc id="307551" wikidata="Q2720481" url="?curid=307551" title="King Louie">
<text>King Louie is a fictional character introduced in Walt Disney&#x27;s animated musical film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. He is an orangutan who leads other jungle primates and wants to become more human-like by gaining knowledge of fire from Mowgli. King Louie is an original character not featured in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s original works.

The filmmakers originally considered Louis Armstrong for the role, but fearing the controversy that may result from casting a black person as an ape, they instead chose Italian-American and fellow New Orleans native Louis Prima. Prima considered playing King Louie as one of the highlights of his career, and felt he had become &quot;immortal&quot; thanks to Walt Disney and the entire studio.

Following a legal dispute with Prima&#x27;s widow, Gia Maione, up until she died in 2013, King Louie was absent from new Disney productions until his appearance in the 2016 live-action &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; film remake (where he was voiced by Christopher Walken).

==&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967)==

Although the Disney adaptation is based on the Kipling stories, the character King Louie does not appear in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s original book, as orangutans are not native to India in real life. Kipling also states in the original that the Bandar-log, the monkeys over which King Louie rules in the film, have no effective leadership, let alone a king. In the book, Mowgli is abducted by a band of unidentified, leaderless Bandar-log monkeys.

Bill Peet&#x27;s original story for the film did not feature King Louie but did feature a larger primate without a tail. Peet left The Walt Disney Company on January 29, 1964, due to a dispute regarding the contents of his script, so his ultimate vision for the king of the Bandar-log remains unknown. Development of the story continued following Peet&#x27;s departure, with his darker story giving way to a new emphasis on lightheartedness and jazzy tunes.

Songwriters, The Sherman Brothers, re-imagined Peet&#x27;s darker more sinister version of King Louie as a more comedic character based around jazz and swing music. As Richard M. Sherman recalled: &quot;...our discussion at the time [was], &#x27;He&#x27;s an ape, what does an ape do? Swings in a tree. The jazz is swing music and a guy literally swings if he’s an ape&#x27;.&quot; Initially, Louis Armstrong was considered for the role. Richard Sherman said: &quot;We thought it would be great for him, but one of the writers said &#x27;You know the NAACP is going to jump all over it having a black man playing an ape – it would be politically terrible&#x27;. That was the last thing on our minds, nothing we&#x27;d ever thought of, so we said &#x27;Okay, we&#x27;ll think of someone else.&#x27;&quot;

Popular jazz and swing performer Louis Prima was cast as King Louie, based on the suggestion of Walt Disney Records president, Jimmy Johnson, that Prima &#x27;would be great as a foil&#x27; for Phil Harris as Baloo. Prima received the audition in 1966, and the antics of him and his band during the audition performance inspired the animators. For example, the segment in which King Louie and the monkeys line up in a parade came from Prima and the band members acted similarly in their performance. Personality was also given to Louie by Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, and John Lounsbery, three of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men who animated the character. Kahl animated Louie&#x27;s interaction with Mowgli, Thomas did his solo song and dance portions, while Lounsbery animated his memorable scat duet with a disguised Baloo.

==&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1994)==
A slightly different version of King Louie appears in Disney&#x27;s 1994 live-action film, portrayed by a trained Bornean orangutan named Lowell. He is once again an orangutan &quot;leader&quot; of a group of monkeys that make their home in an abandoned human city. This version gets his name from King Louis XIV, whose crown he wears. Kaa, a giant snake, appears to serve him. King Louie can summon him with a clap of his hands, even using him to ward off and kill intruders for his own amusement. He initially acts as a rival to Mowgli, but later warms up to him after seeing him defeat Kaa. Louie later watches the battle between Mowgli and Captain William Boone (Cary Elwes), applauding Mowgli for defeating Boone, before sending Kaa to kill Boone.

According to director Stephen Sommers, Lowell was the easiest and most comical animal to work with during filming. Lowell was the only animal actor to portray his character all throughout the film and his scenes were filmed on bluescreen stages in Los Angeles, due to the filming crew being unable to transport him to India.

==&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016)==

Christopher Walken voiced King Louie in Disney&#x27;s 2016 live-action film. This version is portrayed as more sinister and antagonistic than his original incarnation and is a &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, an extinct species of great ape, because orangutans themselves are not native to India while &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; were. In an interview, Walken described King Louie as standing around 12 feet tall, and &quot;as charming as he is, intimidating when he wants to be&quot;.

In the film, Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for the secret of making fire, which he and his fellow Bandar-log plan to use to take over the jungle. While accommodating and friendly at first, he quickly becomes more spiteful and impatient, refusing to believe Mowgli&#x27;s protests that he does not know how to make fire. He is briefly distracted by the appearance of Baloo, allowing Mowgli to be rescued by Bagheera.

However, they are spotted by one of Louie&#x27;s pig-tailed macaque servants, and Louie orders the trio to be captured. Louie goes after Mowgli himself, trying to coerce him into staying by informing him of Akela&#x27;s death. Mowgli refuses to believe this, and an infuriated Louie chases him through the temple, inadvertently destroying the pillars supporting his temple, and causing it to collapse over him. His Bandar-log start digging through the rubble to find him.

During the credits, Louie is shown emerging from the rubble and performs &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be like You&quot; with slightly modified lyrics.

== Other appearances ==
===&quot;TaleSpin&quot;===
In the Disney animated television series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, King Louie (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a fun-loving orangutan who wears a Hawaiian shirt, a straw hat, and a lei. He owns an island nightclub restaurant and hotel called &quot;Louie&#x27;s Place&quot;, located near but outside the protection of the city of Cape Suzette. It also serves as a refueling station/pit stop area for pilots. Louie is Baloo&#x27;s best friend (unlike in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, but like in the later &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;), but can be competitive with him when it comes to women, treasure-hunting, along with business and monetary matters. His hold on the island is somewhat tenuous, even though through his own ingenuity and with the aid of his friends, he has managed to avoid losing it (in the episode &quot;Louie&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;).

===&quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;===
In the Disney animated television series &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;, Louie (voiced by Jason Marsden in Season 1, and Cree Summer in Season 2) is a juvenile orangutan and Baloo&#x27;s best friend. He is very physically active, spending a great deal of his time in trees and eating bananas. Prince Louie (as he is referred to in the show) wants to become king of the jungle one day, and when any man-made objects turn up he immediately shows great interest. Jim Cummings voices the character as an adult on three animated segments featured on the VHS releases of the series.

===&quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;===
Although King Louie is absent in the second film &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; (due to legal issues with Louis Prima&#x27;s estate), a shadow puppet of him can be seen at the very beginning of the film, and Baloo implies that he left the jungle.

===&quot;Fables&quot; comic series===
King Louie appears in the &quot;Fables&quot; comic series published by Vertigo Comics. He is one of the revolutionaries who wish to overthrow the Fabletown government out of resentment at the apparent second-class status of Fables. Due to his peripheral involvement, he is given a sentence of hard labor—twenty years, reduced to five years conditional on good behavior.

In &quot;Fables&quot;, Louie is wrongly described as a &quot;Kipling&quot; character; on his official forums, &quot;Fables&quot; author Bill Willingham cited Louie&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Fables&quot; as &quot;a very good example of why it&#x27;s best to go back to the source material before one embarks on a major story, rather than rely on the often faulty memory of which characters were original canon and which weren&#x27;t&quot;.

=== Other appearances ===
* Q.T., an orangutan who looks very similar to King Louie, is one of the main characters in &quot;Dumbo&#x27;s Circus&quot;.
* Due to Gia Maione&#x27;s legal dispute at the time, Louie is replaced by his very identical twin brother Larry in the &quot;House of Mouse&quot; episode &quot;King Larry Swings In&quot;.
* Louie appears as a meetable character at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.
* In a 1978 live-action sketch titled &quot;The Wonderful World of Ernie&quot; from &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot;, which parodied &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)&quot;, King Louie is played by Ernie Wise using a full costume, although lip-synching to Louis Prima&#x27;s original recording.
* King Louie appears as an unlockable playable character in &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;.
* King Louie appears as a playable character in the mobile game &quot;Disney Heroes: Battle Mode&quot;.

==Reception==

The characterization of King Louie has frequently been cited as an example of racial stereotyping in Disney films, as some view him as a negative sterotype of African Americans. This was not the filmmaker&#x27;s intention, as the character and mannerisms of King Louie were largely based on his voice actor, Louis Prima - a well-known Italian American jazz musician and performer, who would have been instantly recognizable to audiences in the late-1960s. While Louis Armstrong was briefly considered for the part, upon realizing the negative implications, the film-makers quickly steered away from that direction.

In his 2004 book &quot;The Gospel According to Disney&quot;, Mark Pinsky asserts that a child in the current environment (as opposed to in the late 1960s) would not discern any racial dimension to the portrayal. Pinsky also relates &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;&#x27;s film critic Jay Bogar&#x27;s assertion that &quot;the primates could be perceived as representing African Americans in a time of turmoil, but [that Bogar] saw no racism in the portrayal&quot;.

<doc id="307552" wikidata="Q4914589" url="?curid=307552" title="Bio-based material">
<text>A bio-based material is a material intentionally made, either wholly or partially, from substances derived from living (or once-living) organisms, such as plants, animals, enzymes, and microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and yeast.

Due to their main characteristics of being renewable and to their ability to store carbon over their growth, recent years assisted to their upsurge as a valid alternative compared to more traditional materials in view of climate mitigation.

In European context, more specifically, European Union, which has set 2050 as a target date to reach climate neutrality, is trying to implement, among other measures, the production and utilization of bio-based materials in many diverse sectors. Indeed, several European regulations, such as the European Industrial Strategy, the EU Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative and the Circular Action Plan, emphasize bio-materials. These regulations aim to support innovation, investment, and market adoption of bio-materials while enhancing the transition towards a circular economy where resources are used more efficiently. In this regard, the application of bio-based materials has been already tested on several market segments, ranging from the production of chemicals, to packaging and textiles, till the fabrication of full construction components.

Bio-based materials can differ depending on the origin of the biomass they&#x27;re mostly constituted. Moreover, they can be differently manufactured, resulting in either simple or more complex engineered bio-products, which can be used for many applications. Among processed materials, it is possible to distinguish between bio-based polymers, bio-based plastics, bio-based chemical fibres, bio-based leather, bio-based rubber, bio-based coatings, bio-based material additives, bio-based composites. Unprocessed materials, instead, may be called biotic material.

== Bio-based, organic, and bio-degradable materials ==

=== Bio-based materials vs. biodegradable materials ===
Bio-based materials are often biodegradable, but this is not always the case.

By definition, biodegradable materials are formed or organic compounds which can thus be broken down by living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or water molds, and reabsorbed by the natural environment.

Whether a material is biodegradable is determined by its chemical structure, not the origin of the material from which it is made. Indeed, the sustainability benefits of drop-in biobased plastics occur at the beginning of the material life cycle, but still, when manufactured, their structure is identical to their fossil-based counterparts. Therefore, these plastics, known as ‘drop-ins’, are not biodegradable, and should be recycled in existing recycling systems.

In this regard, biodegradability does not support circularity unless biodegradable materials are recovered and processed by a system that can either recapture or upgrade their value. Ensuring a proper infrastructure for these materials to remain in the material management system, for instance through industrial composting or anaerobic digestion, is thus considered to be essential.

=== Bio-based materials vs. organic materials ===
Similarly, bio-based materials are not necessarily organic, as the term &quot;bio-based&quot; simply indicates the material origin. The term &quot;organic&quot; instead refers to the cultivation of plants or the keeping of the animals in compliance with the requirements of the European organic farming standard. Consequently, a bio-product can be both &quot;bio-based&quot; and &quot;organic,&quot; but it is not necessarily so.

=== Bio-based materials vs. fossil-based materials ===
It is not given that bio-based materials always perform better than fossil-based materials.

Their environmental performance depends on a series of factors, related to the sourced material and to the amount and typology of manufacturing processes the raw natural material need to undergo to become a bio-product.

One of the main factors influencing the sustainability of bio-materials is land consumption, land competition for food production and soil depletion. In this regard, in the European context many studies have been conducted to analyze the actual availability of land for the production of bio-materials, while bio-residues and wastes coming from either the agro-industrial and forestry sectors are gaining interest.

Moreover, manufacturing processes needed for the production of competitive bio-alternatives to fossil-based products might lead to higher energy consumptions or to &quot;linear&quot;, non-circular, products. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain a critical mindset based on Life Cycle Assessment analysis, as some bio-products could require either extra material or processing to ensure the same quality, resulting necessarily in more energy consumption.

<doc id="307556" wikidata="Q1426202" url="?curid=307556" title="Hypocotyl">
<text>The hypocotyl (short for &quot;hypocotyledonous stem&quot;, meaning &quot;below seed leaf&quot;) is the stem of a germinating seedling, found below the cotyledons (seed leaves) and above the radicle (root).

==Eudicots==
As the plant embryo grows at germination, it sends out a shoot called a radicle that becomes the primary root, and then penetrates down into the soil. After emergence of the radicle, the hypocotyl emerges and lifts the growing tip (usually including the seed coat) above the ground, bearing the embryonic leaves (called cotyledons), and the plumule that gives rise to the first true leaves. The hypocotyl is the primary organ of extension of the young plant and develops into the stem.

==Monocots==
The early development of a monocot seedling like cereals and other grasses is somewhat different. A structure called the coleoptile, essentially a part of the &quot;cotyledon&quot;, protects the young stem and plumule as growth pushes them up through the soil. A mesocotyl—that part of the young plant that lies between the seed (which remains buried) and the plumule—extends the shoot up to the soil surface, where secondary roots develop from just beneath the plumule. The primary root from the radicle may then fail to develop further. The mesocotyl is considered to be partly hypocotyl and partly cotyledon (see seed).

Not all monocots develop like the grasses. The onion develops in a manner similar to the first sequence described above, the seed coat and endosperm (stored food reserve) pulled upwards as the cotyledon extends. Later, the first true leaf grows from the node between the radicle and the sheath-like cotyledon, breaking through the cotyledon to grow past it. 

==Storage organ==
In some plants, the hypocotyl becomes enlarged as a storage organ. Examples include cyclamen, gloxinia and celeriac. In cyclamen this storage organ is called a tuber.

==Hypocotyl elongation assay==
One of the widely used assays in the field of photobiology is the investigation of the effect of changes in light quantity and quality on hypocotyl elongation. It is frequently used to study the growth promoting vs. growth repressing effects of application of plant hormones like ethylene. Under normal light conditions, hypocotyl growth is controlled by a process called photomorphogenesis, while shading the seedlings evokes a rapid transcriptional response which negatively regulates photomorphogenesis and results in increased rates of hypocotyl growth. This rate is highest when plants are kept in darkness mediated by a process called skotomorphogenesis, which contrasts photomorphogenesis.

<text>Landstraße (; ; &quot;Country Road&quot;) is the 3rd municipal district of Vienna, Austria (). It is near the center of Vienna and was established in the 19th century. Landstraße is a heavily populated urban area with many workers and residential homes. It has 89,834 inhabitants in an area of . It has existed since about 1200 AD. In 1192, the English king Richard the Lionheart was captured in the Erdberg neighbourhood, after the unsuccessful Third Crusade.

To tourists, Landstraße is mostly known for the 18th-century castle and gardens of Belvedere, the residence of Eugene of Savoy, which today houses the Austrian Gallery. Another residence was built by the Russian envoy to Vienna, Count Razumovsky. A more recent point of interest is the Hundertwasserhaus block of flats (apartment block) designed in a dream-like style by the architect and painter Friedensreich Hundertwasser. Museums in Landstraße include the KunstHausWien (&quot;Vienna art house&quot;, also designed by Hundertwasser) and the Museum of Art Fakes. The St. Marx Cemetery in Landstraße contains the grave of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Austrian Chancellor Metternich (1773–1859) once remarked, &quot;The Balkans begin at the Rennweg&quot;, which was then a mere road in Landstraße, out of Vienna towards the east.

==Geography==
Landstraße District is located in the southeastern city center of Vienna. It has an area of 7.42 km2, or 1.8% of the city of Vienna. This district is in the middle of Vienna&#x27;s municipal districts. For one of the &quot;interior districts&quot; the district has a comparatively high proportion of greenery. The district lies along several terraces of the Danube, where the Danube Canal forms the eastern and the Vienna River the northwestern border. In the south of the district, Laaer Berg borders Landstraße.

<doc id="307576" wikidata="Q31572" url="?curid=307576" title="Al-Karak">
<text>Al-Karak (), in English sources often simply Karak, is a city in Jordan known for its medieval castle, the Kerak Castle. The castle is one of the three largest castles in the region, the other two being in Syria. Al-Karak is the capital city of the Karak Governorate.

Al-Karak lies to the south of Amman on the ancient King&#x27;s Highway. It is situated on a hilltop about above sea level and is surrounded on three sides by a valley. Al-Karak has a view of the Dead Sea. A city of about 32,216 people (2005) grew up around castle. The town is built on a triangular plateau with the castle at its narrow southern tip.

==History==
===Iron Age to Assyrian period===
Al-Karak has been inhabited since at least the Iron Age, and was an important city for the Moabites. In the Bible it is called &quot;Kir-haresh&quot;, &quot;Kir-hareseth&quot; or Kir of Moab, and is identified as having been subject to the Neo-Assyrian Empire; in the Books of Kings () and Book of Amos (), it is mentioned as the place where the Arameans went before they settled in the regions in the northern Levant, and to which Tiglath-Pileser III (r. 745–727 BC) sent prisoners after the conquest of Damascus. Later the Shamaili kingdom seized power, but little has been recorded about this period. In 1958, the El-Kerak Inscription was found in Wadi al-Karak, dated to the late 9th century BC.

===Hellenistic to Early Muslim period===
During the late Hellenistic Period, Al-Karak became an important town, taking its name from the Aramaic word for town, Kharkha ().

The area eventually became a Nabatean stronghold. The Roman Empire conquered it in 105 AD. The city was known in Late Antiquity as Harreketh.

Al-Karak is home to some of the oldest Christian communities in the world, dating to the 1st century AD. Under the Byzantine Empire, Charach (, &quot;Kharkh&quot;) or Charach of the Moabites (, &quot;Kharakhmōba&quot;) was the seat of the Church of Nazareth, and remained predominantly Christian under Arab rule following the 629 Battle of Mu&#x27;tah. Its bishop Demetrius took part in the council of the three provinces of Palaestina held in Jerusalem in 536. Another bishop, by the name of John, is said to have lived there in the 9th century.

===Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===

Al-Karak fell within the Crusader lordship of Oultrejourdain, the lands east of the River Jordan and the Dead Sea. In 1132, King Fulk of Jerusalem made Pagan the Butler &quot;Lord of Montreal and Oultrejourdain&quot;. Pagan made his headquarters at al-Karak, where he built a castle on a hill called by the Crusaders &quot;Petra Deserti&quot; - The Stone of the Desert. His castle, much modified, dominates the town to this day.

The castle was in Crusader hands for only 46 years. It had been threatened by Saladin&#x27;s armies several times, but finally surrendered in 1188, after the crushing Crusader defeat at the Battle of Hattin and a siege that lasted more than a year. Saladin&#x27;s younger brother, Al-Adil, was governor of the district until becoming ruler of Egypt and Syria in 1199. Yaqut (1179–1229) noted that &quot;Al Karak is a very strongly fortified castle on the borders of Syria, towards Balka province, and in the mountains. It stands on a rock surrounded by Wadis, except on the side towards the suburb.&quot; Al-Dimashqi (1256–1327) noted that Karak: &quot;is an impregnable fortress, standing high on the summit of a mountain. Its are the valleys around it, which are very deep. They say it was originally, in Roman days, a convent, and was turned into a fortress. It is now a treasure house of the Turks.&quot; Abu&#x27;l-Fida (1273−1331) noted that Al Karak &quot;is a celebrated town with a very high fortress, one of the most unassailable of the fortresses of Syria. About a day&#x27;s march from it is Mutah, where are the tombs of Ja&#x27;afar at Tayyar and his companions. Below Al Karak is a valley, in which is a thermal bath (hammam), and many gardens with excellent fruits, such as apricots, pears, pomegranates, and others.&quot;

Al-Karak was the birthplace of Ibn al-Quff (1233–1286), an Arab Christian physician and surgeon, author of the earliest medieval Arabic treatise intended solely for surgeons.

In 1355, Ibn Battuta wrote: &quot;Al Karak is one of the strongest and most celebrated fortresses of Syria. It is called also &quot;Hisn al Ghurab&quot; (the Crow&#x27;s Fortress), and is surrounded on every side by ravines. There is only one gateway, and that enters by a passage tunnelled in the live rock, which tunnel forms a sort of hall. We stayed four days outside Karak, at a place called &quot;Ath Thaniyyah&quot;.

The castle served as a place of exile and power base during the Mamluk sultanate. Its significance lay in its control over the caravan route between Damascus and Egypt and the pilgrimage route between Damascus and Mecca. In the thirteenth century, the Mamluk ruler Baibars used it during his ascent to power. In 1389 Sultan Barquq was exiled to al-Karak, where he gathered his supporters before returning to Cairo.

===Ottoman period===

In 1596 Al-Karak appeared in the Ottoman tax registers, situated in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Karak, part of the &quot;Sanjak&quot; of Ajlun. It had 78 households and 2 bachelors who were Muslim, and 103 households and 8 bachelors who were Christian. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees/vineyards/fruit trees, a special product (&quot;bayt al–mal&quot;), goats and bee-hives; in addition to occasional revenues, for a water mill, and a market toll. Their total tax was 15,000 akçe.

Al-Karak was inhabited by the Majali tribe, the Tarawneh tribe and the Maaitah tribe.

In 1844 Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt sent an expedition west of the Dead Sea. His troops occupied the castle at al-Karak but they were starved out with much loss of life.

Mohammed Al-Majali who had control of Al-Karak in 1868, was involved in the events that led to the destruction of the Moabite Stone.

In 1893 the Sublime Porte Abdul Hamid II established the sub-province of Ma&#x27;an, with a resident governor (&quot;mutasarif&quot;) in Al-Karak, under the Wāli of Syria based in Damascus. One of the first governors, 1895, was Hussein Helmy Bey Effendi (see also Hüseyin Hilmi Pasha), aged 40, formerly the General Secretary at Damascus. He ruled with a garrison of 1,200 troops, in 3 regiments, mostly conscripts from West of the River Jordan doing their three years of military service. There were also 200 Circassian cavalry. One of his achievements was the disarming of the local population. He also established a Military Hospital with a Jewish doctor; enforced the regulation of coinage and weights and measures; introduced a weekly postal service to Jerusalem, Damascus and Ma&#x27;an; and set up agricultural projects such as the planting of 5,000 grape vines at Madeba.

One estimate of the population of the town and the surrounding area at this time gives a total of 10,000. Of these, 8000 were Muslims and 2,000 were Orthodox Christians whose Church, St George, had been built in 1849. The Latin Mission was established in 1874 and in 1886 Al Majali gave permission to the English Mission to work in the town. The town&#x27;s Orthodox school had 120 boys and 60 girls. The same source notes that the town&#x27;s Mufti had been educated in Hebron and al Azhar, Cairo, and that there was a newly built mosque. Merchants from Damascus came to the town twice each year.

====Karak revolt and Arab Revolt====
The Karak revolt erupted on 4 December 1910 as the governor of Damascus attempted to apply the same measures of conscription, taxation, and disarmament to the inhabitants of Al-Karak that previously provoked the Hauran Druze Rebellion. The uprising ended with an indiscriminate massacre perpetrated by the governor&#x27;s troops.

During the Arab Revolt (1916–1918), the Turkish Army abandoned al-Karak after Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza led a 70 horsemen attack on Mezraa. This Ottoman naval base was rendered useless, after the destruction of the flotilla used to transport grain across the Dead Sea, on 28 January 1918.

===British Mandate, Emirate of Transjordan===
Following the San Remo conference, 1920, Great Britain was given a mandate to govern the area. The newly appointed High Commissioner in Jerusalem, Herbert Samuel, sent several officials east of the River Jordan to create a local administration. Major Alec Kirkbride was based in Al-Karak with a small detachment of policemen. He established what he named &quot;The National Government of Moab&quot; with himself as president. In January 1921 Emir Abdullah Hussein began assembling an army in Ma&#x27;an and announced his intention to attack the French in Syria. After a brief consultation with his superiors Kirkbride&#x27;s government welcomed the arrival of the Emir. At the Cairo conference, March 1921, Abdullah was recognised by the British as ruler of Emirate of Transjordan.

In the 1920s, Al-Karak had a population of 8,000 and had the third largest urban population (after Amman and Salt with 20,000 each) in Transjordan.

===Kingdom of Jordan===
In 1961, the population of Karak town was 7,422 persons, of whom 1,622 were Orthodox Christian while the remaining were Muslim.

In August 1996, there were food riots in the town after the government increased the price of bread.

The town and castle were the scene of an attack by gunmen on 18 December 2016 in which at least 19 people were killed; 13 Jordanian civilians and security forces, a Canadian tourist, and all 5 attackers.

==Climate==
Al-Karak has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Al-Karak is . About of precipitation falls annually.

==Demographics==
Al-Karak&#x27;s metropolitan population was estimated to be 68,800 in 2013, making up 31.5% of the total population of the Karak Governorate. Most of the population of the city is Muslim (75%) and there is also a significant Orthodox Christian population (25%). In general, the percentage of Christians in al-Karak is among the highest in Jordan.

==Cuisine==
Al-Karak is famous for its traditional Jordanian lamb dish called mansaf.

<doc id="307579" wikidata="Q3566524" url="?curid=307579" title="Midland International Air and Space Port">
<text>Midland International Air and Space Port (formerly Midland International Airport) is in the city limits of Midland, Texas, United States, about midway between Downtown Midland and Downtown Odessa, owned and operated by the City of Midland. In September 2014, it was licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration to serve commercial spaceflight.

==Overview==
The airport has four airlines, three serving hubs with regional jets and one flying mainline jets. Southwest Airlines is the largest carrier at the airport. In 2012, 497,193 passengers were enplaned.

==History==

===Origins===
The airport started as Sloan Field, a small airport started in 1927 by Samuel Addison Sloan. Sloan leased 220 acres of flat grassland from Clarence Scharbauer, a rancher. Sam Sloan died in a plane crash in 1929, and his brother, William Harvey Sloan, continued the operation. In 1939, Harvey Sloan sold the field to the City of Midland for $14,500.

As war clouds gathered over Europe in the late 1930s, Midland businessmen could foresee the possibility of a military base in West Texas and in 1940 they started promoting the airfield for use as a training base to the military establishment in Washington. The airfield was upgraded by the Works Progress Administration with runway and taxiway improvements and lighting. Brigadier General G.C. Brant, Commander of the Gulf Coast Air Corps Training Center at Randolph Field, visited and reported that the situation at Midland was favorable. On June 13, 1941, it was announced that Midland would become a training base, Midland Army Air Field.

===World War II===

Midland Army Air Field was home to the Army Air Forces Bombardier School, one of a dozen bombardier-training schools. It was one of the &quot;West Texas Bombardier Quadrangle&quot; schools of the Army Air Forces Training Command, along with Childress Army Airfield, San Angelo Army Airfield and Big Spring Army Airfield. The sole purpose of the Bombardier College was to train young men to use the Norden bombsight.

The first group of cadets, Class 42–6, arrived for training from Ellington, Texas, on February 6, 1942. Midland reached a peak base population of more than 4,000 and graduated a total of 6,627 bombardier officers by the conclusion of the training mission on January 1, 1946.

===Postwar civil use===
The City of Midland annexed much of the land housing the airport on April 26, 1946, while a piece that became a part of a runway was annexed on February 25, 1964.

Midland-Odessa Regional Airport opened its new passenger terminal in the early 1960s. It was served by Continental Airlines and Trans-Texas Airways (and American Airlines, until 1963); the first jets were Continental Boeing 707s in 1965. The terminal had a scalloped roofline, allowing a column-free interior. All services (ticketing, baggage claim and concessions) were inside the building, and a single departure lounge opened onto the apron.

The late 1970s &quot;oil boom&quot; led to economic growth and more flights by incumbent airlines and new entrants like Southwest Airlines; American Airlines returned in June 1981, and America West arrived in 1987.

A new gate area was built along the apron with four second-level gates with jet bridges, concession space and escalator wells linking the addition to the existing terminal. The south end of the main terminal was extended with more ticketing space and the original terminal was modernized (the scalloped roofline was removed).

By the 1990s, several new-entrant carriers had pulled out and most of the rest had downgraded to regional jets; only Southwest, the airport&#x27;s largest carrier, operated main line jets. The terminal building looked tired, and airport officials began planning a replacement. Construction began (in the infield parking lot) in 1996. The first half of the new terminal opened in early 1999 and the 1966 terminal was demolished. The second half of the new terminal was finished in late 1999. The first airplane built and flown in Texas, the &quot;Pliska&quot; (an approximate copy of the Wright Flyer II) was donated to the airport and is displayed in the terminal over the baggage-claim area.

The Confederate Air Force (now the Commemorative Air Force) moved to Midland in 1991 and holds an annual airshow featuring its warbird aircraft at the airport.

In 2012, the Midland City Council amended a contract allowing three teams of experts – Midland International Airport, Parkhill, and Smith &amp; Cooper – to prepare and submit a commercial space launch site application. On September 17, 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration formally approved the application, making Midland International Airport the first primary commercial service airport to be certified as a spaceport. The original primary purpose of the launch site was to permit XCOR Aerospace to test its reusable winged commercial space vehicle, XCOR Lynx. The company relocated its headquarters to the Midland International Airport from where it had planned to offer commercial space flights. The XCOR research &amp; development facility was planned to be located at the airport as part of a $10 million economic development incentive deal. However, as XCOR has since gone out of business, Midland Development Corp. is looking for other space companies to use the facilities.

On April 22, 2024, Delta Airlines returned to Midland with three daily flights to Austin Bergstrom International Airport.

<doc id="307580" wikidata="Q7897538" url="?curid=307580" title="Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States">
<text>The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest-ranking judicial body in the United States. Established by Article III of the Constitution, the detailed structure of the court was laid down by the 1st United States Congress in 1789. Congress specified the Court&#x27;s original and appellate jurisdiction, created 13 judicial districts, and fixed the initial size of the Supreme Court. The number of justices on the Supreme Court changed six times before settling at the present total of nine in 1869. As of June 2022, a total of 116 justices have served on the Supreme Court since 1789. Justices have life tenure, and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office.

Justices are nominated by the President of the United States and then must be confirmed by the United States Senate, before being officially appointed. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate&#x27;s record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees declined office and one died before assuming office.

== 18th century ==

=== George Washington ===
Among the six original nominees to the Supreme Court, George Washington nominated Robert H. Harrison, who declined to serve. The seat remained empty until the confirmation of James Iredell in 1790.

Washington nominated William Paterson for the Supreme Court on February 27, 1793. The nomination was withdrawn by the President the following day. Washington had realized that since the law establishing the positions within the Supreme Court had been passed during Paterson&#x27;s term as a Senator (a post he had resigned in November 1790 after being elected Governor of New Jersey) the nomination was a violation of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution. Washington re-nominated Paterson to the Court on March 4, 1793, after the expiration of what would have been Paterson&#x27;s term as Senator had he not resigned, and Paterson was confirmed by the Senate.

John Jay resigned as Chief Justice on June 29, 1795, after being elected Governor of New York. The subsequent nomination of John Rutledge as Chief Justice was rejected by a vote of 10–14 on December 15, 1795. Rutledge&#x27;s strident and vocal opposition to the Jay Treaty may have been the main reason for his rejection. Because he had been a recess appointment, Rutledge served as Chief Justice for one term. Washington nominated Associate Justice William Cushing to replace him as Chief Justice, but Cushing declined the role. Washington then successfully appointed Oliver Ellsworth to serve as the next Chief Justice.

=== John Adams ===
After Oliver Ellsworth decided to resign from the position of Chief Justice, President John Adams sought to replace Ellsworth with John Jay, who had been the first Chief Justice. Jay was formally nominated, but turned down the position. Adams then successfully nominated his Secretary of State, John Marshall.

== 19th century ==

=== James Madison ===
When William Cushing died, James Madison nominated Levi Lincoln Sr. on January 2, 1811. Lincoln declined the nomination. Alexander Wolcott was then nominated, but was rejected by a vote of 9–24 on February 13, 1811. After John Quincy Adams declined a nomination, Madison was finally successful in filling the seat with his appointment of Joseph Story.

=== John Quincy Adams ===
John Quincy Adams nominated John J. Crittenden on December 18, 1828. The Senate postponed the vote on his confirmation, by a vote of 23–17, on February 12, 1829. The Senate did not explicitly vote to &quot;postpone indefinitely&quot;, but the resolution did have that effect. President Andrew Jackson instead filled the position with John McLean.

=== Andrew Jackson ===
Andrew Jackson nominated Roger B. Taney on January 15, 1835, to be an Associate Justice. A resolution was passed by a Senate vote of 24–21 on March 3, 1835, to postpone the nomination indefinitely. Jackson nominated Taney again on December 28, 1835. After the political composition of the Senate changed the next year, Taney was confirmed as Chief Justice March 15, 1836.

In 1837, Jackson nominated William Smith and John Catron to newly created seats. Both were confirmed, but Smith declined to serve. Later that year, Jackson&#x27;s successor Martin Van Buren appointed John McKinley to fill the vacancy.

=== John Tyler ===
John Tyler experienced extreme difficulty in obtaining approval of his nominees due to his lack of political support in the Senate. Tyler took office in 1841 after the death of Whig President William Henry Harrison. Tyler had been Harrison&#x27;s running mate in the 1840 election, but Tyler clashed with the Congressional Whigs over issues such as the national bank, and these clashes extended to judicial nominees.

John Canfield Spencer was nominated on January 9, 1844, and his nomination was defeated by a vote of 21–26 on January 31, 1844. Reuben H. Walworth was nominated on March 13, 1844, and a resolution to table the nomination passed on a 27–20 vote on June 15, 1844. The nomination was withdrawn from the Senate on June 17, 1844. Edward King was nominated on June 5, 1844. A resolution to table the nomination passed by a vote of 29–18 on June 15, 1844. No other action was taken on this nomination.

The same day that Walworth&#x27;s nomination was withdrawn, Spencer was re-submitted, but there is no record of debate and a letter from the President withdrawing the nomination was received on the same day. Walworth was then re-nominated later that same day, but the motion to act on the nomination in the Senate was objected to, and no further action was taken.

Walworth and King were re-nominated on December 10, 1844, but both nominations were tabled on January 21, 1845. Walworth&#x27;s nomination was withdrawn on February 6, 1845, and King&#x27;s two days later. John M. Read was nominated on February 8, 1845, and there was a motion to consider the nomination in the Senate on January 21, 1845, but the motion was unsuccessful and no other action was taken. On February 14, 1845, the Senate voted to confirm Samuel Nelson.

=== James K. Polk ===
After Henry Baldwin&#x27;s death in 1844, James K. Polk nominated James Buchanan, who declined the nomination. Polk then nominated George W. Woodward, but the Senate rejected him by a vote of 20–29. Baldwin was finally replaced by Robert Cooper Grier in 1846.

=== Millard Fillmore ===
Millard Fillmore, the last member of the Whig Party to serve as president, made three nominations to replace John McKinley, nominating Edward A. Bradford, George Edmund Badger, and William C. Micou, but the Senate, controlled by the Democratic Party, did not take action on any of the nominees. Democratic President Franklin Pierce filled the vacancy with John Archibald Campbell.

=== James Buchanan ===
James Buchanan nominated Jeremiah S. Black to the court in early February 1861 to replace Peter Vivian Daniel. A motion to bring the nomination up for discussion was defeated 25–26 on February 21, 1861. His successor, Abraham Lincoln, filled the seat with Samuel Freeman Miller in 1862.

=== Andrew Johnson ===
Andrew Johnson took office after the death of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Johnson, a former Democrat, had been Lincoln&#x27;s running mate on the National Union ticket of 1864, but Johnson disagreed with Congressional Republicans on several issues, including judicial nominees.

Two justices died in office during Johnson&#x27;s administration, James Moore Wayne and John Catron. Johnson had, in April 1866, nominated Henry Stanbery to be an Associate Justice. The following July, however, Congress passed the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866, which provided for a gradual elimination of seats until only seven were left. Due to the reduction of seats, Stanbery&#x27;s nomination was nullified. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase had urged for this reduction in the hopes that it would result in an increase of the justices&#x27; salaries, which, ironically, did not happen until Congress restored the size of the court to nine members in 1871.

=== Ulysses S. Grant ===
Ulysses S. Grant nominated Ebenezer R. Hoar to a new seat on the court. The Senate rejected this nomination by a vote of 24–33. Grant successfully nominated Joseph Bradley for the seat.

Grant also nominated Edwin M. Stanton, former Attorney General and Secretary of War to the court. The nomination was eventually confirmed, but Stanton died before he was commissioned. Grant then successfully nominated William Strong.

Grant nominated George Henry Williams to be Chief Justice of the United States in 1873, but he later withdrew from consideration. Prior to withdrawal of consideration, the Senate Judiciary Committee declined to recommend confirmation to the entire Senate. Grant then nominated Caleb Cushing for Chief Justice on January 9, 1874, but despite Cushing&#x27;s great learning and eminence at the bar, his anti-war record and the feeling of distrust experienced by many members of the U.S. Senate on account of his inconsistency, aroused such vigorous opposition that his nomination was withdrawn on January 13, 1874. Grant was successful with his third nomination of Morrison Waite.

=== Rutherford B. Hayes ===
Early in 1881, President Rutherford B. Hayes nominated Thomas Stanley Matthews for the position of Associate Justice. Matthews was a controversial nominee due to his close ties to the railroad industry, and as the nomination came near the end of Hayes&#x27;s term, the Senate did not act on it. However, upon succeeding Hayes, incoming President James A. Garfield (who, like Hayes, was a Republican) renominated Matthews, and the Senate confirmed him by a vote of 24 to 23, the narrowest confirmation for a successful U.S. Supreme Court nominee in history. He served on the Court until his death in 1889.

=== Chester A. Arthur ===
In 1882, Chester A. Arthur nominated Roscoe Conkling to serve as an Associate Justice after Ward Hunt resigned. Conkling was confirmed, and then declined the position.

After Conkling declined, Arthur nominated George F. Edmunds, who twice declined to serve. Arthur then nominated Samuel Blatchford, who was confirmed and accepted.

=== Grover Cleveland ===
Associate Justice Samuel Blatchford died in 1893, during the second term of Grover Cleveland. This seat was traditionally held by a New Yorker. Cleveland&#x27;s first two nominees were not confirmed by the Senate; the nomination of William Hornblower was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 24–30 on January 15, 1894. Cleveland&#x27;s follow-up nominee Wheeler Hazard Peckham was also rejected by the Senate, 32–41, on February 16, 1894.

By the tradition of Senatorial courtesy, other Senators generally deferred to a nominee&#x27;s home state senators when evaluating a presidential nomination. The Senators from New York were Edward Murphy Jr. and David B. Hill; Hill objected to Cleveland&#x27;s nominations, and most other Senators supported Hill. Hill was a rival of Cleveland&#x27;s who had lost the Democratic nomination for President to him in 1892.

Cleveland finally overcame Hill&#x27;s opposition by nominating Edward Douglass White of Louisiana. White was a sitting Senator, and Senatorial courtesy dictated that the Senate not reject one of its own. White&#x27;s nomination was approved; he served as an Associate Justice until 1910, and as Chief Justice until his death in 1921.

== 20th century ==

=== Warren Harding ===
President Warren G. Harding nominated Pierce Butler to the Supreme Court in 1922, but the Senate refused to consider his nomination, in part due to Butler&#x27;s advocacy for railroad interests. However, Harding re-submitted the nomination later in the year, and Butler was confirmed in a 61–8 vote.

=== Herbert Hoover ===

On May 7, 1930, Herbert Hoover&#x27;s nomination of Appellate Judge John J. Parker for the Supreme Court was rejected by a vote of 39–41. Parker was nominated to replace Edward Terry Sanford. The American Federation of Labor opposed Parker for his rulings that were favorable towards yellow dog contracts and the NAACP opposed Parker due to concerns about Parker&#x27;s racial views. Hoover attempted to appeal to Southern Democratic senators to vote for Parker, who was from North Carolina, but Hoover was unable to win enough Democratic votes to make up for Republican defections. Hoover&#x27;s second nominee, Owen J. Roberts, was confirmed by the Senate.

=== Dwight D. Eisenhower ===

President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated John Marshall Harlan II in 1954, but his nomination was not reported out of the judiciary committee, in part due to opposition to his purported &quot;ultra-liberal&quot; views. Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in 1955, and the Senate confirmed him in a 71–11 vote.

=== Lyndon B. Johnson ===

Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, then an associate justice, for Chief Justice. Fortas would have succeeded Earl Warren, who had decided to retire. Controversy ensued regarding Fortas&#x27;s extrajudicial activities, and at Fortas&#x27;s request, Johnson withdrew the nomination prior to a vote of the full Senate. Fortas&#x27;s nomination was also opposed by many senators who opposed the rulings of the Warren Court, especially &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;. Fortas&#x27;s nomination was also injured after Johnson withdrew from the 1968 presidential election, leaving himself as a lame duck. President Nixon instead filled the vacancy caused by Warren&#x27;s retirement with Warren Burger.

When Johnson nominated Fortas, he also nominated Homer Thornberry to fill Fortas&#x27; seat. Since Fortas withdrew his name from the Chief Justice nomination, but maintained his seat as an Associate Justice (with Earl Warren continuing as Chief Justice), the nomination of Thornberry was void. He was never voted on by the Senate.

=== Richard Nixon ===

After the Republicans scuttled Fortas&#x27;s nomination as Supreme Court Chief Justice, Democrats retaliated by interfering with Nixon&#x27;s plans to nominate a Southern conservative justice as part of the Republican Party&#x27;s Southern Strategy. When Abe Fortas resigned in 1969 because of a scandal separate from his Chief Justice bid, Richard Nixon nominated Clement Haynsworth, a Southern jurist. His nomination was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 45–55 on November 21, 1969, due to concerns about Haynsworth&#x27;s civil rights record and perceived ethical lapses. In response, Nixon nominated G. Harrold Carswell, a Floridian with a history of supporting segregation and opposing women&#x27;s rights. The Senate rejected his nomination 45 to 51 on April 8, 1970, following much pressure from the Civil Rights and Feminist movements. Nixon&#x27;s third nominee for the Fortas vacancy was Harry Blackmun, who was confirmed by the Senate with no opposition on May 17, 1970.

Nixon was soon faced with two more Supreme Court vacancies when John Harlan and Hugo Black retired in the fall of 1971. Nixon considered nominating Arkansas lawyer Hershel Friday and California intermediate appellate judge Mildred Lillie to the high court. By tradition at the time, potential Supreme Court nominees were first disclosed to the American Bar Association&#x27;s standing committee on the federal judiciary. When it became apparent that this 12-member committee would find that both were unqualified, Nixon passed over Friday and Lillie, and nominated Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist. Powell was confirmed by an 89–1 vote, and Rehnquist was confirmed 68–26.

=== Ronald Reagan ===

When Lewis Powell retired in July 1987, Ronald Reagan nominated Robert Bork. Bork was a member of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia at the time and known as a proponent of constitutional originalism. Bork lost confirmation by a Senate vote of 42 to 58, largely due to Bork&#x27;s conservative opinions on constitutional issues and his role in the Nixon Saturday Night Massacre.

Reagan then announced his intention to nominate Douglas H. Ginsburg to the court. Before Ginsburg could be officially nominated, he withdrew himself from consideration under heavy pressure after revealing that he had smoked marijuana with his students while a professor at Harvard Law School. Reagan then nominated Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed by a Senate vote of 97–0.

== 21st century ==

=== George W. Bush ===

In October 2005, George W. Bush nominated Harriet Miers, a corporate attorney from Texas who had served as Bush&#x27;s private attorney and as White House Counsel, as an Associate Justice to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. Miers was widely perceived as unqualified for the position, and it later emerged that she had allowed her law license to lapse for a time. The nomination was immediately attacked by politicians and commentators from across the political spectrum. At Miers&#x27;s request, Bush withdrew the nomination on October 27, ostensibly to avoid violating executive privilege by disclosing details of her work at the White House. Four days later, Bush nominated Samuel Alito to the seat. Alito was confirmed by a vote of 58–42 on January 31, 2006.

=== Barack Obama ===

In February 2016, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died. The following month, President Barack Obama nominated D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland to replace Scalia. However, the Senate was controlled by the Republican Party, which argued that the next president should instead appoint Scalia&#x27;s successor. Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings on Garland, and Garland&#x27;s nomination remained before the Senate longer than any other Supreme Court nomination. Garland&#x27;s nomination expired with the end of the 114th United States Congress.

The vacancy caused by Scalia&#x27;s death remained unfilled for 422 days, making it just the second Supreme Court vacancy since the end of the American Civil War to remain unfilled for more than one year. On January 31, 2017, President Donald Trump, who succeeded Obama, nominated federal appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch to replace Justice Scalia. Justice Gorsuch was sworn in on April 10, 2017, after being confirmed by a vote of 54–45.

<text>Boilerplate text, or simply boilerplate, is any written text (copy) that can be reused in new contexts or applications without significant changes to the original. The term is used about statements, contracts, and source code, and is often used pejoratively to refer to clichéd or unoriginal writing.

==Etymology==
&quot;Boiler plate&quot; originally referred to the rolled steel used to make boilers to heat water. Metal printing plates (type metal) used in hot metal typesetting of prepared text such as advertisements or syndicated columns were distributed to small, local newspapers, and became known as &#x27;boilerplates&#x27; by analogy. One large supplier to newspapers of this kind of boilerplate was the Western Newspaper Union, which supplied &quot;ready-to-print stories&quot; that &quot;contained national or international news&quot; to papers with smaller geographic footprints, which could include advertisements pre-printed next to the conventional content.

==Boilerplate language==

In contract law, the term &quot;boilerplate language&quot; or &quot;boilerplate clause&quot; describes the parts of a contract that are considered standard. A standard form contract or boilerplate contract is a contract between two parties, where the terms and conditions of the contract are set by one of the parties, and the other party has little or no ability to negotiate more favorable terms and is thus placed in a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; position.

Boilerplate language may also exist in pre-created form letters. The person sending the form letter then usually only needs to add his or her name at the end of the pre-written greeting and body. Typically, the sender of such a letter needs to personalize it minimally, often by just adding their name or specific details to a pre-written greeting and body, making these templates highly practical for mass communication or repetitive correspondence.

== Boilerplate code ==

In computer programming, boilerplate is the sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration. Such boilerplate code is particularly salient when the programmer must include a lot of code for minimal functionality.

A related phenomenon, bookkeeping code, is code that is not part of the business logic, but is interleaved with it to keep data structures updated or able to handle secondary aspects of the program.

==Boilerplate statement==
A boilerplate statement or response generally refers to a message used with minimal effort for multiple different situations. Examples include official statements from government officials such as &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected&quot; or messages left by companies&#x27; voicemail such as &quot;Thank you for holding. Your call is very important to us.&quot;

<text>Falmer is a small village and civil parish in the Lewes District of East Sussex, England, lying between Brighton and Lewes, approximately five miles (8 km) north-east of the former. It is also the site of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&#x27;s Falmer Stadium.

Falmer village is divided by the A27 road. North of the dual carriageway are a few houses and a pub, with a footbridge linking to the southern part of the village, where a large pond is encircled by cottages and the parish church, dedicated to St. Laurence. The two halves of the village are also linked by a road bridge just outside this circle of houses. The village pond is home to a population of ducks and geese, and is very likely to account for the name of the village. The village is recorded in the Domesday Book as &#x27;Falemere&#x27; which is likely to be Saxon for &quot;fallow mere&quot; and mean a dark pool.

The campuses of the University of Sussex, the University of Brighton, and The Keep, are all nearby.

==History==
Before the Norman conquest of England, the manor of Falmer was held by Wilton Abbey. The Domesday Book describes the village as having 43 households: 35 villagers, 7 smallholders and 1 slave. The entry includes ploughlands, meadow, woodland and a church. After the conquest most of it appears to have been given to Gundred, wife of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. In the 11th century the village name was variously spelled Falemela, Falemere or Felesmere. There is 13th century thatched barn, hidden from view behind the church, which was used by the monks of Lewes Priory for storing corn.

Edward II visited Falmer in 1324. Charles I granted the manor to Edward Ditchfield in 1628 or 1629 and he sold it to William Craven. At this time its manor extended over . The Cravens lost it because of their support of the King during the English Civil War.

Due to the proximity of Falmer to the city of Brighton and Hove, the parish has been substantially affected by the twentieth-century development of its large neighbour. Since the 1960s it has been home to the University of Sussex campus, and in the 1990s, the former Brighton Polytechnic Falmer campus became a principal base of the University of Brighton. The village lends its name to the University of Sussex&#x27;s alumni magazine.

==Notable buildings and areas==

The Falmer parish when viewed from above has the shape of the African continent (see link to the parish map in the External links section below). However, the parish, like the village, has been divided by the fast A27, breaking the cohesiveness. On both sides of the road, the contours of the Downland are impressive to behold and, for the most part, even the noise of the road is contained within the A27 valley. The landscape has many visible layers of history. In the slanting light of late afternoon prehistoric and medieval lynchets show up on the slopes of High Park, St Mary&#x27;s Farm and Green Broom.

Sadly despite its long history and its beauty, only a few fragments of ancient Down pasture survive. The minutes of the old Brighton Council Farmlands Committee show that time after time they consented to the ploughing and ultimate wasting of the ancient landscape. The chalk grasslands that the National Trust describe as Europe&#x27;s tropical rainforests, and which are known to support up-to 40 species of flowering plants in one square metre, have largely been destroyed since the second world war by the modern agricultural methods.

The South Downs Way passes through the parish from the south east to the north west and crosses the A27 at Housedean Farm. Falmer parish sits between Brighton and Hove to its west, St Ann Without parish (and then Lewes) to its east, Kingston parish to its south and the long thin parishes running down the scarp slopes to its north, which include Ditchling, Westmeston, Streat, Plumpton, East Chiltington, St John Without, and Hamsey from northwest to northeast.

=== South of the A27 ===
To the south of the A27 is the south half of the village, which includes the church and the large village pond. The Falmer Road travels south to Woodingdean and to the sea at Rottingdean. The downland to the east of the road is part of Falmer parish. To the west are the Falmer Stadium and the University of Brighton which is in City of Brighton and Hove.

====Falmer Church====

Falmer church is dedicated to St. Laurence. The church was built in 1649. It consists of a west tower, a nave and chancel with a vestry to its north. It has a gallery and organ loft at the west end of the nave. It is particularly special because of the pond just outside it.

====Falmer pond====
Perhaps what is most special about this village is its large gravel pond, which is a focal point of the village from where the village and parish got its name. Many people come from Brighton and Lewes to enjoy the pond and the green beside it, to picnic here and watch the ducks.

====Falmer Court Barn====
Behind the church is a manorial thatched barn of fourteen embayments which dates back to the 13th century. It is one of the largest medieval barns in Sussex and was used by the monks of Lewes Priory, who owned the manor, for threshing and storing corn. Falmer barn is a grade II* listed building.

In 2006, the barn, other vernacular farm buildings, and the farmhouse were sold by Brighton and Hove City Council to the tenant farmer, who &quot;promptly sold them on to a property developer.&quot;

====Cranedean Plantation====

By A27, east of the Falmer village, lies a clump of trees called the Cranedean Plantation (). The name ‘Cranedean’ is a corruption of ‘Crane Down’ although cranes are wetland birds and would not be seen on these hills. It has been suggested that the name relates to bustard. ‘Bustard’ is an old French name, whereas ‘crane’ is a Saxon name, so it has been speculated that shepherds and ploughmen may have used the latter term in medieval times. The bustard is likely to have lived in the area. It has some old beeches, particularly at its north end, though the wood is strewn with tumbled hulks from the 1987 gales.

====New Barn valley====
New Barn valley () is east of the Cranedean Plantation and west of the Newmarket garage and cottages. The spur behind shelters the valley from the noisy A27 corridor so it is still peaceful. New Barn was built in 1845. It has two yards and a shepherd&#x27;s room, complete with blackened fireplace, so the shepherd could attend the sheep round-the-clock during lambing.

There are several tumps that look like possible barrows at the top of the slope () south of the barn, next to the South Downs Way. The bank behind the barn has the flowers and insects of old Down pasture.

==== Loose Bottom ====
Half a mile south east of Falmer village are the scrubby pastures of Loose Bottom (), part ancient and part restored to permanent pasture since 1987. Most of these erstwhile heathy Down pastures were bulldozed for corn after 1948, but the slopes in Loose Bottom were saved by their steepness. The name &#x27;Loose&#x27; is derived from a Saxon word for a livestock enclosure (‘hlose’, in Saxon) (), and refers to two ancient earthwork banks that run in the Bottom (both scheduled monuments). Both were probably Saxon cattle enclosures. One runs alongside the Falmer Road before dropping into the head of the valley. There are scattered clumps of burnet rose along large sections of the earthwork banks of both enclosures.

The fragments of surviving Down pasture have now been fenced back into a restored pasture block and the historical chalk grassland flowers are returning. There is now cowslip, wild orchid, devil&#x27;s-bit, betony, rampion and chalk milkwort. There are adonis blue butterflies and emperor moth benefiting from the pasture&#x27;s restoration.

====Newmarket Plantation====

The Newmarket Plantation () lies on the eastern edge of Loose Bottom and the parish and west of the South Downs Way. It is a small deciduous woodland of with beech, ash and sycamore and new plantings. There are mown paths circle its interior since the storms of 1987 and is a place of big upturned rootplates, which is home to many wren and robin.

===North of the A27===
To the north of the A27 is the north half of the village, which is like a quadrant around a small grazed field. The pub is one corner of the quadrant. To the west, just outside of the parish, is the University of Sussex. To the north, north west and north east is special downland, with much history.

==== Farms ====
In Falmer village, at the T-junction between Mill Road and Ridge Road is Park Wall Farm. Running north from Falmer village, half way along Ridge Road and west of Balmer Farm, is the ruins of Ridge Farm (). Now a good place for birdlife, such as yellowhammer, it was the start of the route of the biggest of the mass trespasses that marked the Sussex campaign for the right to roam in 1998–9. Carry on north down Ridge Road and at the end is St Mary&#x27;s Farm.

Housedean Farm () is east along the A27. It manages part of Balmer Down, was one of the last on these Downs to use an ox team for tillage, only giving up in 1914. Balmer Farm () lies on the site of the Saxon hamlet of Bergemere. Its name comes from the Saxon &quot;the pool by the burh&quot;. It was sufficiently important at Domesday to have two slaves, a manorial church, swine pastures in the Weald at Horsted Keynes and Birchgrove, and brookland meadow south of Lewes still called ‘Bormer Brook’. The church has long gone but you can still trace the outlines of the hamlet green under the mess of modern farm clutter. Big blackthorn hedges mark the bounds of the medieval open fields of the hamlet, which drop away southwards from the farmstead (). They went under the evocative names of Lanthorne Laine, Church Laine and Barren Laine.

====Moon&#x27;s Plantation====
Moon&#x27;s Plantation () is planted woodland of . It is mainly beech and at the southern end are in uniformed lines.

Moon&#x27;s Corner slope (), known locally as Sunny Bank, is a little slope that lies north east of Sussex University and west of Ridge Road. It is flowery meadow with orange tip butterflies in the small woodland glades in the spring and a swathe of devil&#x27;s bit scabious in late summer. The bank is shadowy until midday when it becomes alive with insects and butterflies, including brimstone, brown argus, marbled white, small and common blue and clouded yellow. In autumn many migrants stop off in the meadow and common redstarts and spotted flycatchers are regularly seen on a stop over before their flight over the English Channel.

====Waterpit Hill====

A short walk past Ridge Farm ruins is Waterpit Hill (). The south facing slope is intensively farmed, although in the field there is the song of skylarks and along the path hedges there are nesting yellowhammer. David Bangs, a Sussex field naturalists, says, &quot;The north-facing slope of Waterpit Hill is one of the most attractive old Down pasture slopes on the Brighton Downs plateau&quot;. Given its richness as pristine Downland character, it was a good candidate to become Access land after the right to roam act in 2000. There is little scrub, except at its eastern end, and a lot of colour including cowslips, orchids, harebell, yellow rattle, devil&#x27;s bit, wild carrot and picnicker&#x27;s thistle. The northerly aspect brings Neckera crispa moss and the scarce scree Snail, Abida secale, in places.

====Balmer Down====
On Balmer Down are two scheduled monuments, Buckland Hole and Balmer Huff. The two Iron Age and Romano-British villages lay opposite one another. One village was on the spur of the Huff and the other was across Buckland Hole on the ridge where the South Downs Way now runs. At the head of Buckland Hole lay their cemetery, a circular platform of flints and soil some across. Before it was ploughed out, one could make out a banked roadway, a strange enclosure that has been called their circus or moot, and many pits and platforms that used to be found in their field scape, The cemetery yielded up more than twenty funerary urns when it was excavated in 1849. Still now, when one looks down from the Balmer Huff into Buckland Hole one sees a whole valley filled with a pattern of rectangular banks, often topped with gorse or thorn. These are the fossilized fields of the villages. The lineaments are signs of a farmed landscape from two thousand years ago and more and are comparable to the tiny fields in the west of Cornwall or Ireland. Unfortunately, before the area was scheduled, it was intensively farmed and much of the historical evidence has been destroyed.

Also special in areas like this is archaic vegetation, but here, even in the steeper parts of the valley that were not ploughed, modern agribusiness sprays have meant the Down pasture vegetation has been lost and now only the occasional steep lynchet retains a smidgeon of that old flora. Nevertheless, there are still great views of vale of the Lewes Brooks, Kingston Hill and a sliver of Seaford Head cliffs. There are still a scatter of sarsen debris, fossils, yellowed flints that are characteristic of hilltop clay-with-flint, as well as Romano-British pottery to be found in the area and cornfield flowers growing amongst the stones, including common field speedwell, green field speedwell, scarlet pimpernel, knotgrass, field madder and common orache.

====Moustone====

Along the downland path north east of Falmer, past Waterpit Hill, north of Balmer Farm and southeast of Blackcap is Moustone (). It is a slope west of the footpath and was an independent farm when the Domesday book was written, but is now part of Balmer Farm. To the south was the sarsen stone that gave it its name () It is now a lonely place of Roe Deer, Hare and Kestrel. The slope&#x27;s turf is more acidic than Waterpit, with more tormentil and wild strawberry, and most of the old Down pasture herbs are there such as spring sedge, cowslip, rockrose, wild basil, hairy violet and devil&#x27;s bit scabious.

====Four Lord&#x27;s Burgh====
The Four Lord&#x27;s Burgh () is at the point where the South Down Way turns southeasterly. The area is so named because this point was the point where four manorial boundaries came together and each manor had a ‘lord’. The manorial boundaries are now parishes and include Falmer, St John Without, East Chiltington and Plumpton. The boundaries were often aligned on prehistoric features and in the past there were about five round barrows here. Only the two barrows over the fence on the western side of the north–south track still exist as slight tumps, while the rest have been ploughed out.

Due west of Four Lord&#x27;s Burgh lies a triangle of wood pasture () with the pleasing character of a park, now grazed by Sussex cattle. It lies over the boney Lynchets of the field system of the Iron Age and Bronze Age people that farmed this landscape. In August it is rich downland meadow flowers including harebells, rockrose, red clover, eggs and bacon, and scabious. There is much Bracken on the western side, and shady sycamore and oak and occasional gorse.

=== Northwest of the parish ===
The north west of the parish is to the west of St Mary&#x27;s Farm. These areas are north of the University of Sussex and Stanmer Park and used for extensively by walkers and mountain bikers. Millbank Wood, Highpark Wood, Green Broom, Flint Heap and Granny&#x27;s Belt are all woodlands in the area.

====Stanmer Down====

North west of St Mary&#x27;s Farm, and east of Millbank Wood and Highpark Wood, is Shambledean Bottom, Bow Hill and Stanmer Down. The whole of Stanmer Down () used to be covered with prehistoric field systems, and on the top of Bow Hill there may have been as many as nine barrows in two clusters. It survived unploughed until the second world war, but it was left derelict and large areas of it turned to scrub. Since then it has been cleared and cultivated except for islands of scrub kept for pheasant cover. Now the visible signs of the ancient peoples have gone, except when the shadows are long and sharp.

The steep slopes of the bridlepath (), west of Bow Hill, have kept the chalk grassland meadows through cattle grazing and mowing. There is a scatter of thorn, gorse, wild strawberries, harebells and cowslips that help support a healthy butterfly population which includes small copper, small heath and common blue. At its northern end, over the fence-line, there is a tiny fragment of Down pasture on the downslope edge of the thicket (). It has survived in isolation, surrounded by arable, for as much as 150 years, perhaps by rabbit grazing.

====Moon&#x27;s Bottom====

At the bottom of Stanmer Down, Moon&#x27;s Bottom () was intensively farmed, but has been transformed from its derelict state by good scrub control and cattle grazing. It has a cool and mossy slope lying under the shade of Millbank Wood () to the southwest. There are cowslips in spring and in late summer it has a sky-blue dusting of small scabious. Some parts of it have a slightly acidic soil chemistry, with tormentil, sweet vernal-grass and field wood-rush. On the flat ground above the eastern end of this slope is a scrub-covered round barrow ().

====Green Broom, Flint Heap and Granny&#x27;s Belt====
Green Broom and Flint Heap () have large, old beeches and fallen giants, but only Green Broom is used extensively as mountain bike track and has some large jumps for those brave enough. The fallen trees have great fungal assemblages. The very rare lion&#x27;s mane fungus (Hericium erineus) has been found in at least two places as well as dog stinkhorn (Mutinus caninus), bird&#x27;s nest fungus (Cyathus striatus), yellow stainer (Agaricus xanthodermus), Earth stars (Geastrum triplex), lots of turkey tail (Trametes versicolor), and many others. If one is lucky (or unlucky depending on your disposition) one might even smell the distinctive aroma of the ordinary stinkhorn, Phallus impudicus,

Near to Granny&#x27;s Belt () there are reports that a sarsen stone circle existed till the 19th century. Although this may not be an authentic stone circle, there must still be many sarsens in situ, perhaps like the one exposed by excavations at Rocky Clump.

====Rocky Clump====

Rocky Clump (), east of Upper Lodge Wood, was a late Iron Age/Romano-British site. There is a huge sarsen stone in the trees as well as evidence for a Roman grain storage building and pit almost 2 metres deep. After the Romans left, it is thought to have been used as a pagan Saxon temple known as ‘Paeccel&#x27;s Weoh’. ‘Weoh’ is Saxon for ‘sacred place’, or even ‘temple’. The name was corrupted to Patchway, which became the modern name until recently for the whole Ditchling Road ridge between Upper Lodge Wood and Hollingbury Hill. The area was named in the Saxon charter of 765 AD and the parish boundary is aligned through it.

==Governance==
At a local level Falmer is governed by Falmer Parish Council. Its responsibilities include footpaths, street lighting, playgrounds and minor planning applications. The parish council has five seats.

The next level of government is the district council. The parish of Falmer lies within the Kingston ward of Lewes District Council, which returns a single seat to the council. The election on 7 May 2015 elected a Liberal Democrat.

East Sussex County Council is the next tier of government, for which Falmer is within the Newhaven and Ouse Valley West division, with responsibility for Education, Libraries, Social Services, Civil Registration, Trading Standards and Transport. Elections for the County Council are held every four years. The Liberal Democrat Carla Butler was elected in the 2013 election.

The UK Parliament constituency for Falmer is Lewes. The Conservative Maria Caulfield, a local nurse, was elected in 2015 defeating the incumbent Liberal Democrat Norman Baker who was the constituency MP from 1997.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, the village was part of the South East England constituency in the European Parliament.

==Sport==
Lewes Priory Cricket Club play some home games in Falmer and have Sussex and Brighton universities students and staff as members.

===Stadium===

To the west of the parish is the site of Falmer Stadium, home of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. Despite its name and proximity to Falmer, it is actually inside the City of Brighton and Hove boundary. After a lengthy process including a public enquiry, it was approved by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2005, but Lewes District Council subsequently mounted a legal challenge and overturned the decision on a technicality. The stadium was reapproved by Secretary of State Hazel Blears on 24 July 2007. The 30,500-seater stadium opened in July 2011.

==Falmer station==
Falmer is served by Falmer railway station which lies on the East Coastway line.

<text>An export in international trade is a good produced in one country that is sold into another country or a service provided in one country for a national or resident of another country. The seller of such goods or the service provider is an &quot;exporter&quot;; the foreign buyers is an &quot;importer&quot;. Services that figure in international trade include financial, accounting and other professional services, tourism, education as well as intellectual property rights.

Exportation of goods often requires the involvement of customs authorities.

== Firms ==
For any firm, Global expansion strategies may include:

* Franchising,
* Turn Key Project,
* Export,
* Joint Venture,
* Licensing,
* Creating an owned subsidiary,
* Acquisition,
* Merger, etc.

Exporting is mostly a strategy used by product based companies. Many manufacturing firms begin their global expansion as exporters and only later switch to another mode for serving a foreign market.

== Barriers ==
There are four main types of export barriers: motivational, informational, operational/resource-based, and knowledge.

Trade barriers are laws, regulations, policy, or practices that protect domestically made products from foreign competition. While restrictive business practices sometimes have a similar effect, they are not usually regarded as trade barriers. The most common foreign trade barriers are government-imposed measures and policies that restrict, prevent, or impede the international exchange of goods and services.

=== Strategic ===

International agreements limit trade-in and the transfer of certain types of goods and information, e.g., goods associated with weapons of mass destruction, advanced telecommunications, arms and torture and also some art and archaeological artifacts. For example:
* Nuclear Suppliers Group limits trade in nuclear weapons and associated goods (45 countries participate).
* The Australia Group limits trade in chemical and biological weapons and associated goods (39 countries).
* Missile Technology Control Regime limits trade in the means of delivering weapons of mass destruction (35 countries).
* The Wassenaar Arrangement limits trade in conventional arms and technological developments (40 countries).
Although the outbreak of COVID-19 sufficiently changed the world economy, people started doing business, so international trade is a key for economic growth. Armenia&#x27;s economy is dependent on international flows, tourism, and inner production. Competitive export Industries were established which helped the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to generate financial resources. The market shifted to more efficient exporters, which is the effect of trade liberalization on aggregate productivity. Due to the increase of the number of international business activities through a multilateral trading system, RA Government Program, which was approved in February 2019, the government policy became the objective of economic growth. The period established for the program was 2019-2024. Export quality is developed by developing the export volumes and services.

=== Tariffs ===
Tariffs, a tax on a specific good or category of goods exported from or imported to a country, is an economic barrier to trade. A tariff increases the cost of imported or exported goods, and may be used when domestic producers are having difficulty competing with imports. Tariffs may also be used to protect an industry viewed as being of national security concern. Some industries receive protection that has a similar effect to subsidies; tariffs reduce the industry&#x27;s incentives to produce goods quicker, cheaper, and more efficiently, becoming ever less competitive.

The third basis for a tariff involves dumping. When a producer exports at a loss, its competitors may term this &quot;dumping&quot;. Another case is when the exporter prices a good lower in the export market than in its domestic market. The purpose and expected outcome of a tariff is to encourage spending on domestic goods and services rather than their imported equivalents.

Tariffs may create tension between countries, such as the United States steel tariff in 2002, and when China placed a 14% tariff on imported auto parts. Such tariffs may lead to a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) which sets rules and attempts to resolve trade disputes. If that is unsatisfactory, the exporting country may choose to put a tariff of its own on imports from the other country.

== Advantages ==
Exporting avoids the cost of establishing manufacturing operations in the target country.

Exporting may help a company achieve experience curve effects and location economies in their home country. Ownership advantages include the firm&#x27;s assets, international experience, and the ability to develop either low-cost or differentiated products. The locational advantages of a particular market are a combination of costs, market potential and investment risk. Internationalization advantages are the benefits of retaining a core competence within the company and threading it though the value chain rather than to license, outsource, or sell it.

In relation to the eclectic paradigm, companies with meager ownership advantages do not enter foreign markets. If the company and its products are equipped with ownership advantage and internalization advantage, they enter through low-risk modes such as exporting. Exporting requires significantly less investment than other modes, such as direct investment. Export&#x27;s lower risk typically reduces the rate of return on sales versus other modes. Exporting allows managers to exercise production control, but does not provide them the option to exercise as much marketing control. An exporter enlists various intermediaries to manage marketing management and marketing activities.
Exports also has effect on the Economy. Businesses export goods and services where they have a competitive advantage. This means they are better than any other country at providing that product or have a natural ability to produce either due to their climate or geographical location etc.

== Disadvantages ==
Exporting may not be viable unless appropriate locations can be found abroad.

High transport costs can make exporting uneconomical, particularly for bulk products.

Another drawback is that trade barriers can make exporting uneconomical and risky.

For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 250 employees, export is generally more difficult than serving the domestic market. The lack of knowledge of trade regulations, cultural differences, different languages and foreign-exchange situations, as well as the strain of resources and staff, complicate the process. Two-thirds of SME exporters pursue only one foreign market.

Another disadvantage is the dependency on almost unpredictable exchange rates. The depreciation of foreign currency badly affects exporters. For example, Armenia exports different things - from foodstuff to software. In 2022, the country had an enormous number of Russian visitors and tourists because of the military situation in Russia. This resulted in a change in exchange rates and the appreciation of the Armenian dram. At first, it may seem that Armenia’s economy is growing. In fact, the GDP growth is expected to hit 7% by the IMF. However, exporters, who export products and get paid mostly in dollars, suffer because of the depreciation of the dollar against the Armenian dram. Moreover, Armenia’s other exporting bright spot is the IT industry, since a lot of companies and individuals work for US-based companies and get paid in US dollars. Because of the drastic change in the exchange rates, these people and companies who export their service to the US or other countries and get paid in US dollars, make around 25% less revenue.

Exports could also devalue a local currency to lower export prices. It could also lead to imposition of tariffs on imported goods.

== Motivations ==
The variety of export motivators can lead to selection bias. Size, knowledge of foreign markets, and unsolicited orders motivate firms to along specific dimensions (research, external, reactive).

== Macroeconomics ==
In macroeconomics, net exports (exports minus imports) are a component of gross domestic product, along with domestic consumption, physical investment, and government spending. Foreign demand for a country&#x27;s exports depends positively on income in foreign countries and negatively on the strength of the producing country&#x27;s currency (i.e., on how expensive it is for foreign customers to buy the producing country&#x27;s currency in the foreign exchange market).

<doc id="307598" wikidata="Q1545186" url="?curid=307598" title="Papabile">
<text> ( , , ; ; ) is an unofficial Italian term first coined by Vaticanologists and now used internationally in many languages to describe a Catholic man, in practice always a cardinal, who is thought a likely or possible candidate to be elected pope.

In some cases the cardinals will choose a candidate. Among the cardinals who have been elected pope are Eugenio Pacelli (Pius XII), Giovanni Battista Montini (Paul VI), Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) and Jorge Mario Bergoglio (Francis). However, at times the College of Cardinals elects a man who was not considered by most Vatican watchers. In recent years those who were elected pope though not considered include John XXIII, John Paul I, and John Paul II.

The list of changes as cardinals age. For instance, Carlo Maria Martini was thought to be until he retired from his see upon reaching 75 years of age. There is a saying among Vaticanologists: &quot;He who enters the conclave as pope, leaves it as a cardinal.&quot; This is a popular proverb in Italy as well, indicating one should never be too sure of oneself.

== Terminology ==
The term is at least as old as the 15th century, since it is found in the .

In Italian, the word is also used in non-Church contexts. This includes usage in reference to short list candidates, i.e. those who, among the available candidates, are most likely to get elected or appointed to a specific position.

== elected pope==
* Francesco Saverio Castiglioni (elected as Pius VIII in 1829) was at both the 1823 conclave and at the 1829 conclave. Pope Pius VII during his lifetime called Cardinal Castiglioni &quot;Pope Pius VIII&quot; and at the 1823 conclave, the cardinal ultimately elected as Pope Leo XII stated that Cardinal Castiglioni would someday be Pope Pius VIII. Castiglioni came close to being elected at the 1823 conclave but lost support due to being identified as being close to Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, a moderate and Secretary of State of the late Pope Pius VII. Consalvi later died during Leo XII&#x27;s pontificate and Castiglioni, a once more when Leo XII himself died, was subsequently elected Pope at the 1829 conclave. His election was facilitated in that of the other , Bartolomeo Pacca was opposed by France while the other Emmanuele de Gregorio failed to get the support of the majority of the other cardinals. Upon his election, Castiglioni took the name Pius VIII, given that his two immediate predecessors had previously called him by that name.
* Gioachino Pecci (elected as Leo XIII in 1878). The majority of the cardinals who headed to Rome for the 1878 conclave had already decided to support Pecci who was Camerlengo. Pecci was also perceived to be the opposite of the recently deceased Pius IX.
* Giacomo della Chiesa (elected as Benedict XV in 1914)
* Eugenio Pacelli (elected as Pius XII in 1939). Pope Pius XI prior to his death strongly hinted that he favored Cardinal Pacelli as his successor. On 15 December 1937, during his last consistory, Pius XI strongly hinted to the cardinals that he expected Pacelli to be his successor, saying &quot;He is in your midst.&quot; He had previously been quoted as saying: &quot;When today the Pope dies, you&#x27;ll get another one tomorrow, because the Church continues. It would be a much bigger tragedy, if Cardinal Pacelli dies, because there is only one. I pray every day, God may send another one into one of our seminaries, but as of today, there is only one in this world.&quot;
* Giovanni Battista Montini (elected as Paul VI in 1963). Montini had been discussed as a candidate in the 1958 conclave despite not having been a cardinal at the time; Cardinal Giuseppe Siri during the discussion about Montini was furious that a non-cardinal would even be considered. It was also rumored some of the French cardinals voted in favor of Montini during that conclave. John XXIII had sent vague signals during his reign that he believed his friend Montini (whom he made a cardinal) would be his successor.
* Joseph Ratzinger (elected as Benedict XVI in 2005). On 2 January 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should he die or become too ill to continue as pope. On the death of John Paul II, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; gave the odds of Ratzinger becoming pope as 7–1, the lead position, but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church. In April 2005, before his election as pope, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot;. At the conclave, &quot;it was, if not Ratzinger, who? And as they came to know him, the question became, why not Ratzinger?&quot; On 19 April 2005, he was elected on the second day after four ballots.
* Jorge Mario Bergoglio (elected as Francis in 2013). Bergoglio was a at the 2005 conclave and was also considered a contender at the 2013 conclave due to his being the reported &quot;second-place finisher&quot; at the 2005 conclave. According to John L. Allen Jr., some of the participants in the 2005 conclave who were also participating in the 2013 conclave were &quot;getting another bite at the apple&quot;. Despite this, his election still came as a surprise because some of the commentators who considered him made the observation that there were &quot;compelling reasons to believe that Bergoglio&#x27;s window of opportunity to be pope has already closed&quot; and that &quot;his &#x27;moment&#x27; seems to be over&quot;.

== not elected==

Being seen as is no guarantee of election, and is sometimes seen as a handicap. (Although the following candidates were widely discussed as candidates publicly, the actual vote results described below are frequently based on rumours and sourced, if at all, from off-the-record reports of individual cardinals.)
* Emmanuele de Gregorio – expected to succeed Leo XII and Pius VIII, but never did.
* Bartolomeo Pacca – an experienced diplomat under Pius VII, he was a candidate in 1823 and favored to win in 1829 but was vetoed by France. Cardinal Castiglioni was elected as Pius VIII.
* Mariano Rampolla – Leo XIII&#x27;s Secretary of State. He was headed for victory in the 1903 conclave only to be vetoed by Kraków Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko on behalf of Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I. With Rampolla blocked, Giuseppe Sarto was elected and became Pius X. One of Pius X&#x27;s first acts was to abolish the rights of states to veto.
* Rafael Merry del Val was a widely considered candidate during the conclaves of 1914 and 1922 which eventually elected Benedict XV and Pius XI respectively, although he never garnered enough votes to be in serious contention.
* Giuseppe Siri was widely expected to be elected pope in the 1958 and 1963 conclaves and continued to be a prime contender in both 1978 conclaves. On the first of these occasions, Angelo Roncalli, an unexpected choice, was elected and became Pope John XXIII.
* Giovanni Benelli was widely expected to be elected pope in both the August and October 1978 conclaves. In fact he was defeated in both (narrowly the second time). In August, a candidate few saw as , Albino Luciani, was elected and became Pope John Paul I–with the support of Benelli himself. In October, another such candidate, Karol Wojtyła, was elected as John Paul II.
* Carlo Maria Martini – Jesuit, biblical exegete, Archbishop of Milan from 1980 to 2002. Considered to be the most likely successor to John Paul II for much of the 1980s and 1990s but was already suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease by the time the 2005 papal conclave was convened.
* Francis Arinze – speculated by some media reports as a highly favoured successor to John Paul II but did not gain a substantial number of votes in the 2005 papal conclave.

== at the 2013 conclave==
The following cardinals, as noted in the cited references, were also considered at the 2013 conclave, which elected Jorge Mario Cardinal Bergoglio, who took the name Francis.
* Angelo Bagnasco, Archbishop of Genoa
* Timothy M. Dolan, Archbishop of New York
* Péter Erdő, Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest
* Seán Patrick O&#x27;Malley, Archbishop of Boston
* Marc Ouellet, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops
* Gianfranco Ravasi, President of the Pontifical Council for Culture
* Leonardo Sandri, Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches
* Odilo Pedro Scherer, Archbishop of São Paulo
* Christoph Schönborn, Archbishop of Vienna
* Angelo Scola, Archbishop of Milan
* Luis Antonio Tagle, Archbishop of Manila
* Peter Turkson, President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace

== in future conclave – &quot;The Next Pope&quot; (2020)==
Edward Pentin, Rome correspondent for the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot;, released a book in August 2020 entitled &quot;The Next Pope: The Leading Cardinal Candidates&quot;, listing 19 Cardinals he considered for a future conclave after Pope Francis. Some of them have turned 80 since the publication of the book and thus will not be part of a future conclave (but could still be elected pope). Several others are due to reach the age of 80 in the next couple of years. The nineteen listed:

==Non- elected pope==
* Barnaba Chiaramonti (elected as Pius VII in 1800) was not considered but emerged as an alternative candidate following months of deadlock. Chiaramonti was well-regarded among many of the cardinals, but tried to dissuade them from electing him since he was content with being a bishop. Cardinal Jean-Sifrein Maury first proposed Chiaramonti as a compromise candidate to break the stalemate.
* Annibale della Genga (elected as Leo XII in 1823) was not considered due to his physical infirmities and the cardinal himself at the conclave tried to discourage the other electors from voting for him. However, he was elected because the conclave received information about secret societies who were perceived to have grown in strength during the period, and some cardinals wanted a quick conclusion to the conclave; his physical condition made some cardinals think that his pontificate would not last long.
* Bartolomeo Alberto Mauro Cappellari&#x27;s (elected as Gregory XVI in 1831) election was unexpected and had been influenced by the fact that the most candidate, Giacomo Giustiniani, had been vetoed, therefore resulting in a deadlock.
* Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto (elected as Pius X in 1903) emerged as an alternative candidate after the veto of Mariano Rampolla.
* Achille Ratti (elected as Pius XI in 1922) was elected as a compromise candidate between the conservative faction headed by Rafael Merry del Val and the moderate faction headed by Pietro Gasparri. Gasparri also threw his support behind Ratti and urged his supporters to vote for Ratti.
* Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (elected as John XXIII in 1958). Some commentators like William Doino dispute the contention that Roncalli was a non- and argue that &quot;[b]y the time of Pius XII&#x27;s death, in 1958, Cardinal Roncalli &#x27;contrary to the idea he came out of nowhere to become pope&#x27; was actually one of those favored to be elected. He was well known, well liked and trusted.&quot;
* Albino Luciani (elected as John Paul I in 1978). Although Luciani was not considered , one of the cardinals, Giovanni Benelli, used his influence to persuade the others to elect Luciani at the conclave.
* Karol Wojtyła (elected as John Paul II in 1978) was elected as a compromise candidate due to the failure of the leading Giuseppe Siri and Giovanni Benelli to obtain the requisite majority and the only other viable Italian compromise candidate Giovanni Colombo announced to the cardinal-electors at the conclave that he would decline the papacy if elected.

Prior to 1978, no non-Italian had been elected Pope since the 1522 conclave that chose the short-lived Dutch Pope Adrian VI.

<text>Vaticanology is a term coined in the 20th century to describe the field of journalism and research studying and reporting about how the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church operate. It is named after the Vatican City, the Holy See&#x27;s sovereign territory enclaved within Rome, Italy. Particular emphasis tend to be placed on the selection and appointment mechanisms by which the Church&#x27;s leadership emerges.

A journalist or scholar focusing on this area of expertise is sometimes referred to as a Vaticanologist, Vaticanist, or Vatican watcher.

==Origin and history==
It owes its origins to the term Kremlinologist, which was used to describe media, academic and commentary experts who followed the function of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in general and the functioning and selection of the leadership elite in particular. Both the Kremlin and the Holy See operated in a great degree of secrecy and mystery, hence the attention paid to &quot;experts&quot; who were presumed to be able to read subtle nuances indicating who was on the &quot;way up&quot;, who was on the &quot;way down&quot; and who were the &quot;ones to watch&quot; within their leadership elites.

Famous Vaticanologists include the author and commentator Peter Hebblethwaite, who wrote biographies of (among others) Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, as well as a best-selling account of the events of 1978 in &quot;Year of Three Popes&quot;. Robert Blair Kaiser was a noted contributor in the field, who did much reporting on the Second Vatican Council for &quot;TIME&quot;. In 2005, with the first papal election in the age of the continuous news cycle and the internet, many &quot;Vaticanologists&quot; became prominent through their wide dissemination both on television and in online publications. Blogs have become a popular means for amateur Vatican watchers to share their thoughts and insights.

<text>Renaissance Man is a 1994 American comedy film directed by Penny Marshall, and starring Danny DeVito, Gregory Hines, James Remar and Cliff Robertson. It follows a former advertising executive teaching military soldiers at school. In Australia, the film is known under the title of Army Intelligence. The film received generally negative reviews. It grossed $24 million at the box office against a budget of $40 million.

==Plot==
Bill Rago is a divorced advertising executive down on his luck. When he loses his job in Detroit, the unemployment agency finds him a temporary job: teaching basic literacy classes at a nearby U.S. Army training base, Fort McClane.

Initially unenthusiastic, Rago finds that he has only six weeks to teach a group of undereducated soldiers the basics of comprehension and use of English language. Most of the soldiers are only semi-literate and equally unenthusiastic.

Unable to connect with his pupils and desperate to spark their interest, Rago quotes from his favorite play, &quot;Hamlet&quot; by William Shakespeare. They are unfamiliar with it (or even the concept of a &quot;play&quot;) and a small initial spark of interest is generated. He casts each student as a character in a classroom reading, then takes everyone on a field trip across the Blue Water Bridge to Stratford, Ontario Canada, to a live performance by Shakespearean actors. He introduces them to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; as well.

In the meantime, he takes steps to mend bridges with his daughter by buying her an airline ticket to Mexico – as well as buying her a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope – so that she can start on the path to becoming a professional astronomer.

Despite the disapproval of their hard-as-nails Drill Sergeant Cass, and the loss of one of the trainees, Private Hobbs, who is revealed as a drug dealer hiding under an assumed identity, Rago sets an end-of-term oral examination. Even the friendly Captain Murdoch, who is in charge of the project doesn&#x27;t expect the soldiers to pass Rago&#x27;s class, adding that if they fail they will be discharged from the Army.

Hobbs writes a letter to Rago and Murdoch, whose letters to the prison warden may result in him getting an early parole. Hobbs says he read &quot;Othello&quot; in the prison library (the librarian said he was the first inmate in 16 years to request Shakespeare) and was thinking about taking college classes once he&#x27;s released.

While on duty, on a dare from Cass in front of other men, Pvt. Benitez recites the St. Crispin&#x27;s Day Speech by King Henry V while in full combat gear in the middle of a rainstorm during a night exercise; the speech moves even the hardened Sergeant Cass. The students then all pass Rago&#x27;s class with flying colors.

Rago meets and dates Marie, a soldier in the records department who helps him do some investigation before the base&#x27;s graduation ceremony. It results in Private Davis being presented with the Silver Star medal his father was to have been awarded posthumously, after he was killed in Vietnam.

As the proud soldiers march at their graduation parade, Rago is saluted by his &quot;graduates&quot;. He signs on to continue teaching soldiers-in-training.

==Cast==


==Production==
The script was written by Jim Burnstein. Marshall requested rewrites to make the script funnier, not merely by adding more jokes but by &quot;deepening the characters and finding all the humor and heart in them.&quot;
Burnstein was on call during filming to answer questions about the script, particularly when it came to lines relating to Hamlet. He visited the set, spending time at each location. Marshall allowed him to watch some of the dailies but as it was his first film he did not offer his opinions, and he also knew that editors would be &quot;the last writer&quot; and make their own changes to the film. Burnstein and his family appeared as extras at the baseball game. 
DeVito was cast in April 1993.
Filming began on July 2, 1993, and ended on November 26, 1993. The scenes at the fictional &quot;Fort McClane&quot; were actually filmed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. The production trailers were set up alongside the barracks on &quot;Tank Hill&quot;. During the filming, soldiers were filmed doing P.T. (physical training) and B.R.M. (basic rifle marksmanship), and the graduation scene of the film was shot during an actual basic training graduation. In one of these scenes Geoff Ramsey can be seen doing jumping jacks. The scene of Danny DeVito on a pay phone was shot at a phone bank that countless soldiers have used to call home during basic training. The scenes of DeVito going over the bridge from Detroit to Canada are actually him driving over the Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia, Point Edward, Ontario and Port Huron, Michigan.

It had a production budget of $40 million.

== Reception ==
&quot;Renaissance Man&quot; received mainly negative reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of a possible four. Ebert said that &quot;the touch that was used so well in director Penny Marshall&#x27;s previous films &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; is totally missing in &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; and it feels like a cross between &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; and &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; but does not have the warmth or spirit of those films.&quot; He also wondered what Devito&#x27;s character teaching Shakespeare&#x27;s plays had to do with the training of the military recruits. Ebert gave it a thumbs-down on his television show, but partner Gene Siskel enjoyed it as pleasant fare and gave it a thumbs-up. Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine called it &quot;a feel good movie which is too mechanically put together to make you feel anything.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the likable cast but called it &quot;Inherently condescending, and finally awash in warm-bath sentimentality, this setup never goes out of style.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes it holds a 12% rating based on 25 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Renaissance Man&quot; tries to simultaneously be a literary comedy, an inspirational drama, and a star vehicle that caters to Danny DeVito&#x27;s strengths, but proves to be a master of none.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 44 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

The film flopped at the U.S box office, grossing only US$24 million in the United States and Canada in 12 weeks. It was hindered by competing with summer blockbusters such as &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;True Lies&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

<text>The foreign relations of Canada are Canada&#x27;s relations with other governments and nations. Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions. Canada is known for its strong commitment to international peace and security, as well as being a mediator in conflicts, and for providing aid to developing countries. The &quot;golden age of Canadian diplomacy&quot; refers to a period in Canadian history, typically considered to be the mid-20th century, when Canada experienced a high level of success in its foreign relations and diplomatic efforts.

Canada&#x27;s peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global image. Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations. Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined. The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its participation to UN-sanctioned military operations through NATO, rather than directly through the UN. Canada has faced controversy over its involvement in some foreign countries, notably the 1993 Somalia affair. Canada&#x27;s military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas in multiple operations.

Canada and the United States have a long, complex, and intertwined relationship; they are close allies, co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts. Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France, along with both countries&#x27; former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the . Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II. Canada has diplomatic and consular offices in over 270 locations in approximately 180 foreign countries.

Canada is a member of various international organizations and forums. Canada was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 and formed the North American Aerospace Defense Command together with the United States in 1958. The country has membership in the World Trade Organization, the Five Eyes, the G7 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976. The country joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 , and seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.

==History==

==Administration==
In 1982, responsibility for trade was added with the creation of the Department of External Affairs and International Trade. In 1995, the name was changed to Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.

Canada has often carried out its foreign policy through coalitions and international organizations, and through the work of numerous federal institutions (e.g.: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police International Peace Operations Branch or deployments of personnel by the Correctional Service of Canada). Under the aegis of Canadian foreign policy, various departments and agencies conduct their own international relations and outreach activities. For example, the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence conduct defence diplomacy in support of national interests, including through the deployment of Canadian Defence Attachés, participation in bilateral and multilateral military forums (e.g., the System of Cooperation Among the American Air Forces), ship and aircraft visits, military training and cooperation, and other such outreach and relationship-building efforts.

There are two major elements of Canadian foreign relations, Canada-US relations and multilateralism.

Greg Donaghy, of Canada&#x27;s Department of Foreign Affairs, argues:
:Since taking power in 2006, Prime Minister Harper&#x27;s government has clearly abandoned the liberal internationalism that had so often characterized Ottawa&#x27;s approach to world affairs, replacing it with a new emphasis on realist notions of national interest, enhanced capabilities, and Western democratic values.

Canada&#x27;s international relations are the responsibility of the Department of Global Affairs, which is run by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position currently held by Melanie Joly. Traditionally the Prime Minister has played a prominent role in foreign affairs decisions. Foreign aid, formerly delivered through the Canadian International Development Agency, has been administered by DFATD since March 2013.

==Foreign aid==

Canada&#x27;s foreign aid was administered by the Canadian International Development Agency, which provided aid and assistance to other countries around the world through various methods. In March 2013 CIDA ceased to exist when it was folded into DFAIT, creating DFATD. The strategy of the Canadian government&#x27;s foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises. However a growing focus on development, defence, and diplomacy in recent decades has produced a concentration of foreign aid funding to countries determined to be security risks to Canadian policy. For example, in 2004–2005 the largest recipients of Canada&#x27;s official developmental assistance were Afghanistan and Iraq, two nations in conflict with the United States of America and its allies at the time. The structural emphasis on security and industry development has contributed to a fixed foreign policy that generally fails to consider global health and international social and economic inequalities. According to the OECD, 2019 official development assistance from Canada increased 0.5% to US$4.7 billion.

==Federalism and foreign relations==
The provinces have a high level of freedom to operate internationally, dating to 1886 and Quebec&#x27;s first representative to France, Hector Fabre. Alberta has had representatives abroad, starting with Alberta House in London (37 Hill Street), since 1948, and British Columbia around 25 years before that. By 1984, Quebec had offices in ten countries including eight in the United States and three in other Canadian provinces while Ontario had thirteen delegations in seven countries.

== Diplomatic relations ==
List of countries which Canada maintains diplomatic relations with:
==Bilateral relations==
===Africa===
===Americas===
===Asia===
===Europe===
=== Oceania ===
==Other bilateral and plurilateral relations==
One important difference between Canadian and American foreign policy has been in relations with communist governments. Canada established diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (13 October 1970) long before the Americans did (1 January 1979). It also has maintained trade and diplomatic relations with communist Cuba, despite pressures from the United States.

===Arms Control===
Canadian Government guidance for export controls on weapons systems is published by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada.

*United States of America – 1926 – first minister Vincent Massey

==Multilateralism==
Canada is and has been a strong supporter of multilateralism. The country is one of the world&#x27;s leading peacekeepers, sending soldiers under the U.N. authority around the world. Canadian former Minister of Foreign Affairs and subsequent Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson, is credited for his contributions to modern international peacekeeping, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957. Canada is committed to disarmament, and is especially noted for its leadership in the 1997 Convention in Ottawa on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines.

In the last century Canada has made efforts to reach out to the rest of the world and promoting itself as a &quot;middle power&quot; able to work with large and small nations alike. This was demonstrated during the Suez Crisis when Lester B. Pearson mollified the tension by proposing peacekeeping efforts and the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force. In that spirit, Canada developed and has tried to maintain a leading role in UN peacekeeping efforts.

Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations, such as the Vietnam War or the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, but does join in sanctioned operations such as the first Gulf War, Afghanistan and Libya. It participated with its NATO and OAS allies in the Kosovo Conflict and in Haiti respectively.

Despite Canada&#x27;s track record as a liberal democracy that has embraced the values of the UN&#x27;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Canada has not been involved in any major plan for Reform of the United Nations Security Council; although the Canadian government does support UN reform, in order to strengthen UN efficiency and effectiveness.

Canada hosted the third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City.

Canada is working on setting up military bases around the world, while reducing aid and diplomatic efforts. In the late 90s, Canada actively promoted the notion of human security as an alternative to business-as-usual approaches to foreign aid. However, by invoking the &quot;three Ds&quot; (defense, diplomacy, and development) as the fundamental basis for Canadian foreign policy, and then implementing this in a manner that conforms more to military security and trade interests, Canada has successfully distanced itself from the humanitarian objectives of foreign aid, with the human security goal far from being achieved.  Under the Harper government, emphasis on promoting Canada&#x27;s military presence internationally has included an effort to rebrand Canada historically as a &quot;warrior nation&quot;, in large measure to counter the image of only supporting peacekeeping and multilateralism.

===Canada’s relations within the Americas===
Canada joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and has been an active member, hosting the OAS General Assembly in Windsor, Ontario, in June 2000.

==== Canada–Caribbean relations ====

Many Caribbean Community countries turn to Canada as a valued partner. Canadians, particularly Canadian banks and utility companies play an important economic role in the development of former British West Indies colonies. Efforts to improve trade have included the idea of concluding a free trade agreement to replace the 1986 bilateral CARIBCAN agreement. At various times, several Caribbean countries have also considered joining Canadian Confederation as new provinces or territories, although no Caribbean nation has implemented such a proposal. Note that many Caribbean countries are also involved in the Commonwealth of Nations, below.

=== Canada–Commonwealth of Nations ===

Canada maintains close links to the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms, with which Canada has strong historic ties and shares a monarch. It also remains a member of the Commonwealth.

===Canada–Europe and Canada–European Union relations===
Canada is an active participant in discussions stemming from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

Two overseas territories of EU members, Greenland (Denmark) and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (France) lie adjacent to Canadian territorial waters.

==Territorial and boundary disputes==

Canada and the United States have negotiated the boundary between the countries over many years, with the last significant agreement having taken place in 1984 when the International Court of Justice ruled on the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine. Likewise, Canada and France had previously contested the maritime boundary surrounding the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, but accepted a 1992 International Court of Arbitration ruling.

Remaining disputes include managed maritime boundary disputes with the US (Dixon Entrance, Beaufort Sea, Strait of Juan de Fuca, Machias Seal Island).

===Arctic disputes===

A long-simmering dispute between Canada and the U.S. involves the issue of Canadian sovereignty over the Northwest Passage (the sea passages through the Arctic Archipelago). Canada&#x27;s assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait (international waters). Canadians were incensed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker Manhattan through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker Polar Sea in 1985, both without asking for Canadian permission. In 1970, the Canadian government enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a zone. In response, the Americans in 1970 stated, &quot;We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.&quot; A compromise was reached in 1988, by an agreement on &quot;Arctic Cooperation,&quot; which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers &quot;will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.&quot; However the agreement did not alter either country&#x27;s basic legal position. Essentially, the Americans agreed to ask for the consent of the Government of Canada without conceding that they were obliged to. In January 2006, David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Canada, said his government opposes Stephen Harper&#x27;s proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.

Along with other nations in the Arctic Council, Canada, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Russia, the maritime boundaries in the far north will be decided after countries have completed their submissions, due in 2012. Russia has made an extensive claim based on the Russian position that everything that is an extension of the Lomonosov Ridge should be assigned to Russia. Their submission had been rejected when first submitted by the United Nations in 2001.

In June 2019, the U.S. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the US &quot;view Canada’s claim that the waters of the Northwest Passage are internal waters of Canada as inconsistent with international law.&quot;

In December 2024, Canada outlined plans to address growing global interest in the Arctic, driven by climate change and geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Recognizing climate change as the central threat, Canada committed to strengthening regional alliances, particularly with the U.S., while enhancing military defenses and asserting sovereignty over the Northwest Passage. It also aimed to resolve territorial disputes with the U.S. and Denmark, revive the Arctic ambassador role, and expand diplomatic ties in Alaska and Greenland. Indigenous leaders, though supportive, stressed the urgent need for better infrastructure in Arctic communities to bolster sovereignty and resilience.

<text>The Christian Science Publishing Society was established in 1898 by Mary Baker Eddy and is the publishing arm of The First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts.

== Origin and purpose ==
The Christian Science Publishing Society and the Board of Trustees that manage it were established by Mary Baker Eddy in a deed of trust on January 25, 1898, under the auspices of The First Church of Christ, Scientist. Although she had not wanted to create a separate trust to handle the church&#x27;s publications, legal considerations made it necessary. Written in the deed is Eddy&#x27;s express intent for the Publishing Society, that it is &quot;for the purpose of more effectually promoting and extending the religion of Christian Science as taught by me.&quot; Always concerned about the purity of the teaching, she was reported by her student Septimus J. Hanna to have said just days before signing the deed, that she wanted &quot;to protect and preserve the literature of [Christian Science] in its purity&quot;. She wanted to protect her teachings from &quot;aggressive attempts&quot; to adulterate them, which she felt would wreak havoc within the church and would cause misrepresentations of her teachings, both within and outside the church.

== Publications ==
In addition to Mary Baker Eddy’s works, they publish a number of periodicals, including the monthly &quot;The Christian Science Journal&quot;, the weekly &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot;, &quot;The Herald of Christian Science&quot; published in a number of languages; and the &quot;Christian Science Quarterly&quot;, also published in a number of languages. The &quot;Quarterly&quot; contains the Bible lessons used as sermons in Sunday services in all Christian Science churches around the world. They also publish biographies of Eddy and other books and study materials on Christian Science.

There is also an international weekly newspaper, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, which has won several Pulitzer Prizes. The &quot;Monitor&quot; is a secular newspaper; however, there is one religious article in each issue.

The Publishing Society is managed by a three-person Board of Trustees under the authority of the Christian Science Board of Directors. It is located, along with the Mary Baker Eddy Library, in the Publishing Society building at the Christian Science Center in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay. It is the primary publisher of the writings of Mary Baker Eddy and other Christian Science literature.

<doc id="307615" wikidata="Q6250360" url="?curid=307615" title="John Newman (Australian politician)">
<text>John Paul Newman (born Johann Grauenig, formerly Naumenko; 8 December 1946 – 5 September 1994) was an Australian politician who served as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1986 until his assassination in 1994.

==Early life==
Johann Grauenig was born in Villach, Austria, on 8 December 1946, the son of John Arch and Helene Grauenig. His mother later married Peter Naumenko, and changed her son&#x27;s surname accordingly. He later anglicised his surname to &quot;Newman&quot; by deed poll on 17 March 1972. Newman arrived in Australia in 1950, aged four, and his family settled in Cabramatta in the western suburbs of Sydney. He attended Cabramatta Public School and Liverpool Boys High School.

==Political career==
Newman had a long history of involvement with the labour movement and with the Labor Party, spending much of his working life as a union official. He was a State union organiser with the Federated Clerks&#x27; Union from 1970 to 1986. Newman completed post-graduate studies in industrial law at the University of Sydney and undertook a variety of Trade Union Training Authority education programmes. Newman was elected as an alderman of the Fairfield City Council in 1977 and remained on the council for 10 years. He was deputy mayor in 1985–86 and also served as acting mayor in 1986. In December 1979 Newman&#x27;s pregnant wife, Mary, and five-year-old son, David, were killed in an automobile accident at Bossley Park.

Following a by-election in the seat of Cabramatta, Newman was elected to Legislative Assembly of New South Wales on 1 February 1986. He was easily re-elected at the 1988 and 1991 state elections. Since the 1970s, Cabramatta has been a centre for immigrants and refugees from Asian backgrounds, particularly Vietnam, China, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. Prior to his assassination, Newman had waged a campaign (by helping to form &quot;Task Force Oak&quot;) to combat Asian organised crime. and fight the corruption, drugs, crime (particularly home invasions), and prostitution that had plagued the Cabramatta area. 

==Death==
At 9:30 pm. on the night of 5 September 1994, in the car-park of his Woods Avenue, Cabramatta home, he was shot twice and killed instantly. His fiancée, Lucy Wang, was with him at the time (helping to put a car cover on his vehicle) but saw little of what happened because of the swiftness of the murder. She reported seeing a hooded man in an army style jacket, who fired four shots, then fled in a waiting car. Newman was later given a state funeral.

== Investigation ==
Within days, the leader of a gang, 21-year-old Tri Minh Tran became the prime suspect. A local club owner, Phuong Ngo&#x27;s conflict with Newman and his close ties to Tran led to widespread rumours in the community that he was involved and the media repeated the allegations. Tran, who had led the gang since the age of 14, was assassinated on 7 August 1995. Ngo attended the funeral and he now became the focus of police attention after one of Tran&#x27;s relatives made a statement to police that Tran had rejected an offer of $10,000 from Ngo to kill Newman.

The case against Ngo was weak and after Ngo provided information to police that led to the arrest of the informant, the task force investigating the Newman murder was disbanded. Ngo who had previously attempted to secure Labor Party pre-selection for the seat of Cabramatta and had run against him as an independent in 1991, was convicted of the killing in 2001. Two of Ngo&#x27;s alleged associates were acquitted. Ngo has never confessed to the murder and continues to protest his innocence, claiming he had no motive to kill Newman because he was offered the Cabramatta seat about eight hours before the MP was shot.

Ngo had been tried on three occasions for the murder of Newman. The first trial was aborted for legal reasons, and, in the second trial, the jury could not reach a verdict. In the third trial, held from 7 March 2001 to 29 June 2001, Ngo was convicted of murdering Newman and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

In 2003, an appeal by Ngo against the conviction failed. A judicial inquiry was launched into the conviction of Phuong Ngo on 6 June 2008, by order of Chief Justice James Spigelman of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The inquiry was overseen by former and Acting District Court judge, David Patten, and addressed several concerns raised as to the validity of the original conviction. On 17 April 2009 Patten ruled that the original conviction was sound. Following the inquiry, calls were made to have Ngo&#x27;s name removed from monuments in Cabramatta. Calls for the council to name a landmark in honour of Newman have not proceeded so far, although a swimming pool in Prairiewood bears his name.

<doc id="307621" wikidata="Q581281" url="?curid=307621" title="Cinema of Albania">
<text>The film industry in Albania comprises the art of films and movies made within the country or by Albanian directors abroad. Albania has had an active cinema industry since 1897 and began strong activities in 1940 after the foundation of both the &quot;Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re&quot; and National Center of Cinematography in Tirana.
In consideration to the Albanian diaspora, there are several internationally renowned actors such as the Albanian-Americans Eliza Dushku, Klement Tinaj, Masiela Lusha, Jim and John Belushi, Kosovo-Albanians Bekim Fehmiu and Arta Dobroshi and Turkish-Albanian Barish Arduç.

Albania annually hosts several International Film Festivals. The most important is certainly the Tirana International Film Festival, which takes place in the capital of Tirana. Born in 2008, the Durrës International Film Festival is also among the most prominent exhibitions held in summer at the Amphitheatre of Durrës.

==History==
===Foundation===
Films were first shown in Albania starting in 1897, as part of travelling shows and to aristocrats. Kolë Idromeno, a photographer, started showing films in 1908 or 1909, and is regarded as the first Albanian to do so by the National Center of Cinematography. The Charles Urban Trading Company shot films in Albania from between 1902 and the Balkan Wars. Albert Kahn&#x27;s ethnographical footage from 1912 was among the first films shot in Albania.

On 10 September 1942, Benito Mussolini ordered the creation of the Tomorri Society, which would make films in Albania. Mihallaq Mone, who studied at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, was its director. One of the first Albanian films shot with an Albanian cast was the short film &quot;Encounter at the Lake&quot; &quot;(Takim në liqen)&quot; from 1943. Mone left Albania in 1945, and spent the remainder of his life in the United States.

===Communist===
The Central State Film Archive reported that 286 films were made in the communist period. stated that 103 films were produced between 1978 and 1984, and 86 films were produced between 1985 and 1991.

In 1946, Italian films accounted for a plurality of films shown in Albania and still accounted for one-third of foreign films shown in 1955. Albania started importing films from the Soviet Union in the 1950s. 21 feature films and 87 documentaries were imported in 1951, and 9 feature films and 77 documentaries were imported in 1952.

The National Filmmaking Enterprise was formed in 1947, and started producing newsreels and documentaries. &quot;The Great Warrior Skanderbeg&quot;, a Soviet-Albanian coproduction, was released in 1953. In 1950, Jani Nano, Mihal Çarka, Koço Tollko, Petraq Lubonja, Endri Keko, and Xhanfise Keko were sent to study for two years at the Moscow Central Studio for Documentary Film. Keko was one of the few female directors in the communist period.

The New Albania Kinostudio was opened on 10 July 1952, and started producing newsreels and short films. It was Albania&#x27;s only film studio under communist rule. Kristaq Dhamo&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;Tana&quot; was Kinostudio&#x27;s first feature-length film and is regarded as the first one in Albanian history.

In 1952, &quot;Daughters of China&quot; (&quot;Zhong Hua nu er&quot;) became the first Chinese film shown in Albania. The Sino-Albanian Cultural Cooperation Agreement was signed on 14 October 1954. &quot;Forward, Side by Side&quot; (&quot;Krah pёr krah&quot;/&quot;Bing jian qianjin&quot;), the first Sino-Albanian coproduction, was directed by Endri Keko and Hao Yusheng in 1964.

Filmmaker was imprisoned between 1956 and 1990.

There were 33 cinemas in Albania in 1945, with around 7,000 seats. The number of cinemas rose from 35 in 1950, to 72 in 1960, and 105 in 1973. The Albanian National Film Festival was held eight times between 1976 and 2001.

===Modern===
Kinostudio closed in 1991, and was split into Albafilm, Albafilm Distribution, Albafilm Animation, and the Albanian State Film Archive. The Tirana International Film Festival was launched in 2003.

Kujtim Çashku established Academy of Film and Multimedia Marubi (Akademia e Filmit e Multimedias Marubi), the first private film school in the country, in 2004.

The Institute for the Study of Communist Crimes and Consequences proposed banning showings of Kinostudio films in 2017.

Erenik Beqiri&#x27;s &quot;The Van&quot; was nominated for the Short Film Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the first time an Albanian production was represented at Cannes since 1954.

<doc id="307623" wikidata="Q3710397" url="?curid=307623" title="Inhaler spacer">
<text>A spacer is a device used to increase the ease of giving aerosolized medication from a metered-dose inhaler (MDI). It adds space in the form of a tube or &quot;chamber&quot; between the mouth and canister of medication. Most spacers have a one-way valve that allows the person to inhale the medication while inhaling and exhaling normally; these are often referred to as valved holding chambers (VHC).

A number of brand names exist including AeroChamber, InspirEase and Volumatic. They can also be made from a 500 mL plastic bottle, which works just as well.

Spacers help those unable to breathe deeply, as well as those unable to synchronize their breathing so that they inhale just as the MDI is actuated; the latter is known as poor &quot;hand-lung coordination&quot;.

==Terminology==
The term spacer is often used to refer to any tube-like MDI add-on device. Some spacers (e.g., InspirEase) utilize a collapsing bag design to provide visual feedback that successful inspiration is taking place. Another type (e.g., Volumatic) is transparent plastic in two vase-shaped parts that come together forming a barrel shape. Valved holding chambers (VHC) are commonly called &quot;spacers&quot; as well. 

==Uses==

To use an inhaler without a spacer requires coordinating several actions in a set order (pressing down on the inhaler, breathing in deeply as soon as the medication is released, holding your breath, exhaling), and not everyone is able to master this sequence. Use of a spacer, particularly a valved holding chamber, avoids such timing issues. Valved holding chambers are particularly useful for children, people with severe shortness of breath, and those with cognitive impairment.

After removing the MDI&#x27;s cap, the MDI mouthpiece is inserted into the back of the spacer. The front part of the chamber is closed off by either a mouthpiece or a mask that covers the mouth and nose. To administer the medication, the MDI is depressed once, resulting in the release of one dose of medication. The medication from the MDI is then suspended in the spacer&#x27;s chamber while the person inhales the aerosolized medication by breathing in and out. The exhaled breath exits the device through the valves rather than entering the chamber. Some spacers are equipped with a whistle, which sounds if the person is inhaling too quickly.

Spacers slow down the speed of the aerosol coming from the inhaler, meaning that less of the asthma drug impacts on the back of the mouth and somewhat more may get into the lungs. In the case of corticosteroids, less residue in the mouth reduces the risk of developing oral candidiasis, a yeast infection. Rinsing the mouth after application of inhaled steroids has a similar effect.

Whereas people with asthma can keep an MDI close-by at all times, the bulkiness of spacers can limit their use outside the home. Some research suggests that homemade spacers, using plastic bottles, may be as effective as commercially made versions, but homemade versions may have more variability.

<text>The diplomatic relations between Canada and the French Republic are friendly, the importance of which centres on the history of French immigration to Canada. Canadians of French heritage make up the majority of native speakers of French in Canada, who in turn account for about 22 percent of the country&#x27;s total population. The small French Territorial Collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon is situated off the coast of Atlantic Canada.

Both nations are mutual members of the G7, G20, OECD, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, NATO, United Nations and the World Trade Organization.

== History ==

=== European colonization ===

In 1720, the British controlled Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Northern and much of Western Canada, but otherwise, nearly all of Eastern Canada, from the Labrador shore and on the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes and beyond was under French domination. The gradual conquest of New France by the British, culminating in James Wolfe&#x27;s victory at the Plains of Abraham in 1759, deprived France of its North American empire. The French of Canada, (the Québécois or habitants, Acadians, Métis, and others) remained.

After the British conquest, French immigration to Canada continued on a small scale until the start of the wars between France and Britain from 1792 to 1815. French books circulated widely, and the French Revolution led many conservative refugees to seek asylum in Canada. The English-speaking population of Canada also grew rapidly after the American Revolution. Francophone opinion among the rural habitants towards France turned negative after 1793. As British subjects, the habitants, led by their conservative priests and landowners, rejected the French Revolution&#x27;s impiety, regicide, and anti-Christian persecution. The habitants supported Britain in the War of 1812 against the United States. Many Canadians have also spoken French since their settlement began in 1534.

=== Dominion of Canada ===
In early Canadian history, foreign affairs were under the control of the British government. Canada pushed against those legal barriers to further its interests. Alexander Galt, Canada&#x27;s informal representative in London, attempted to conclude a commercial treaty with France in 1878, but tariff preference for France violated British policy. The Foreign Office in London was unsupportive of sovereign diplomacy by Canada, and France was moving to new duties on foreign shipping and was embarking toward a general policy of Protectionism. Galt&#x27;s efforts, however, set the stage for a successful treaty in 1893 negotiated by Sir Charles Tupper (1821–1915), Canada&#x27;s High Commissioner in London. However, that treaty was signed by the British ambassador to France.

In 1910, the Province of Quebec dispatched its own representative to Paris, Hector Fabre. The federal government responded by asking him to become Canada&#x27;s agent-general in France. He and his successor, Philippe Roy, represented both levels of government informally until 1912, when the new Canadian government asked Roy to resign from the Quebec position because of fears of a possible conflict of interest.

=== World Wars ===
A realignment of the great powers made allies of Canada, which was part of the British Empire, and France just in time for the two World Wars that would dominate the first half of the 20th century.

The Canadian Expeditionary Force spent much of the First World War on French soil and helped France to repel the German invasion. It was in France, at Vimy Ridge, that one of the most famous battles in Canadian history took place.

In December 1917, the accidental explosion of the French freighter &quot;Mont Blanc,&quot; carrying five million pounds of explosives, devastated Halifax, Nova Scotia, killing 2,000 and injuring 9,000. The SS Mont-Blanc had been chartered by the French government to carry munitions to Europe; France was not blamed, and charges against its captain were dropped.

During the Second World War, Canada and France were initially allies against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. After the Fall of France in 1940, most Western governments broke off relations with the Vichy regime, but Canada continued to have relations with Vichy until 1942.

Canada had planned a military invasion of the islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. Controlled until the end of 1941 by Vichy France, it was the liberation by the Free French under Admiral Muselier that put an end to any invasion by Canada.

Eventually, Canada became an important ally and staunch supporter of General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces. De Gaulle himself re-entered France after the Invasion of Normandy via the Canadian-won Juno Beach, and during a lavish state visit to Ottawa in 1944, he departed the assembled crowd with an impassioned call of &quot;Vive le Canada! Vive la France!&quot;

=== Suez Crisis ===
During the Suez Crisis, the Canadian government was concerned with what might be a growing rift between the western allies. Lester B. Pearson, who would later become the Prime Minister of Canada, went to the United Nations and suggested creating a United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in the Suez to &quot;keep the borders at peace while a political settlement is being worked out.&quot; Both France and Britain rejected the idea and so Canada turned to the United States. After several days of tense diplomacy, the United Nations accepted the suggestion, and a neutral force not involving the major alliances (NATO and the Warsaw Pact although Canadian troops participated since Canada spearheaded the idea of a neutral force) was sent with the consent of Nasser, stabilizing conditions in the area. The Suez Crisis also contributed to the adoption of a new Canadian flag without references to that country&#x27;s past as a colony of France and Britain.

=== 1967 controversy by de Gaulle ===
In July 1967, while on an official state visit to Canada, the then president of France, Charles de Gaulle, ignited a storm of controversy by exclaiming, before a crowd of 100,000 in Montreal, &quot;Vive le Québec Libre!&quot; (Long live free Quebec!) Coming on the centennial year of Canadian Confederation, amid the backdrop of Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution, such a provocative statement on the part of a widely respected statesman and liberator of France had a wide-ranging effect on Franco-Canadian relations and on relations between Quebec and the rest of Canada as well.

De Gaulle, a proponent of Quebec sovereignty, proposed, on several subsequent occasions, what he termed the &quot;Austro-Hungarian solution&quot; for Canada (based on the Austria-Hungary dual-monarchic union shared between Austria and Hungary from 1867 to 1918), which appeared to be similar to the &quot;sovereignty association&quot; model that was later championed by René Lévesque.

France&#x27;s intervention in Canadian intergovernmental relations remained largely in the realm of diplomatic rhetoric. Indeed, as Quebec, under the reformist Liberal government of Jean Lesage, was turning away from a more isolationist past and attempting to find for itself a new place within the Canadian federation and the wider francophone world, a willing and enthusiastic de Gaulle was eager to give aid to Quebec&#x27;s newfound nationalist ambitions.

==== Master Agreement ====
The first step towards Quebec developing an &quot;international personality&quot; distinct from that of Canada, viewed by many as a stepping stone towards full independence, was for Quebec to develop relations with other nations independent from those of Canada. That effort began in earnest after de Gaulle&#x27;s return to power, when France and Quebec began regularly exchanging ministers and government officials. Premier Lesage, for example, visited de Gaulle three times between 1961 and 1965.

Lesage&#x27;s statement to the Quebec National Assembly that the French Canadian identity, culture, and language were endangered by a &quot;cultural invasion from the USA,&quot; which threatened to make Canada a &quot;cultural satellite of the United States,&quot; mirrored exactly the Gaullists concern for France&#x27;s cultural survival in the face on an English onslaught. In that light, France and Quebec set about in the early 1960s negotiating exchange agreements in the areas of education, culture, technical co-operation, and youth exchange. The federal government of Lester B. Pearson, which had just appointed a Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism and was taking other steps to ensure the place of French within Canada, would not stand for a province usurping a federal power (foreign policy) and so signed a Master Agreement with France in 1965 that allowed for provinces to cooperate directly with France but only in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction (such as education).

==== &quot;Quebec Mafia&quot; ====
The significant contingent of sovereigntists within the French government and the upper levels of the French foreign and civil services (especially Gaullists), who came to be known as the &quot;Quebec Mafia&quot; within the Canadian foreign service and the press, took full advantage of the Master Agreement of 1965 to further their vision for Canada.

===== Direct relations with Quebec =====

Shortly after de Gaulle&#x27;s 1967 Montreal address, the French Consulate-General in Quebec City, already viewed by many as a &quot;de facto&quot; embassy, was enlarged and the office of Consul General at Quebec replaced, by de Gaulle&#x27;s order, with that of Consul General to the Quebec Government. At the same time, the flow of officials to Quebec City increased further, and it became accepted practice for high officials to visit Quebec without going to Ottawa at all, despite Ottawa&#x27;s repeated complaints about the breaches of diplomatic protocol.

Many of the French officials, notably French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Jean de Lipkowski, greatly angered and embarrassed the Canadian government by vocally supporting Quebec independence while they were in Canada. The media spoke of a &quot;Quebec Mafia&quot; in Paris.

The Québec government maintained a Provisional Government Office in Paris.

===== La Francophonie =====
One issue that sparked tensions between France and Canada began shortly after the creation of &quot;la Francophonie&quot;, an international organization of wholly and partially French-speaking countries that is modelled somewhat after the Commonwealth of Nations. While Canada agreed in principle to the organization&#x27;s creation, it was dismayed by France&#x27;s position that not only Quebec should participate as an equal, independent member, but also the federal government and, by omission, the other Canadian provinces with significant French minorities could not. That was seen by many French-Canadians outside Quebec as a betrayal and was also seen by some Canadians as France supporting the Quebec sovereignty movement. Some went as far as saying the Francophonie was created to help push the international recognition of Quebec, but the Francophonie was created to promote international co-operation between all French speaking nations, including many newly independent former French colonies in Africa.

The first salvo in the Francophonie affair was launched in the winter of 1968, when Gabon, under pressure from France, invited Quebec and not Canada or the other provinces to attend a February francophone education conference in Libreville. Despite protests from the federal government, the Quebec delegation attended and was treated to full state honours. In retaliation, Pearson took the extraordinary step of officially breaking off relations with Gabon. Pierre Trudeau, then Justice Minister, accused France of &quot;using countries which have recently become independent for her own purposes&quot; and threatened to break diplomatic relations with France.

The next such educational conference, held in 1969 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo-Kinshasa, known as Zaire 1971–1997), would end in a relative win for the Canadian government. Congo-Kinshasa, which was a former colony of Belgium, was not as susceptible to French pressure as Gabon was. At first, it sent an invitation only to the federal government, which happily contacted the provinces concerned (Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Manitoba) about organizing a single delegation. Quebec, which was dismayed over the lack on an invitation, complained to the French, who then put pressure on Congo-Kinshasa, which issued a second belated invitation to Quebec, offering as justification Quebec&#x27;s attendance at the Gabon conference. Despite the last-minute offer, Canada and the provinces had already reached an agreement by which the provinces would attend as sub-delegations of the main Canadian delegation.

The final rounds in the effort to include Canada, not Quebec separately, in la Francophonie would take place in the months leading up the organization&#x27;s founding conference in Niger in 1969. It was that conference that would set the precedent that is still followed and so France, Quebec, and Canada were not prepared to go home the loser. For its part, France demanded that Quebec – and only Quebec – be issued an invitation. Niger – influenced in no small part by a promise of four years of &quot;special&quot; educational aid, a grant of 20,000 tons of wheat, and a geological survey of Niger offered by Canadian special envoy Paul Martin Sr. the month before – issued Canada the sole invitation and asked that the federal government bring with it representatives of the interested provinces. The invitation, however, left open the prospect of Quebec being issued a separate invitation if the federal and provincial governments could not come to an agreement.

Much to the consternation of the French and the sovereigntists in the Quebec government, the federal and provincial governments reached an agreement similar to the arrangement employed in Congo-Kinshasa, with a federal representative leading a single delegation composed of delegates from the interested provinces. Under the arrangement, la Francophonie would grow to become a major instrument of Canadian foreign aid along with the Commonwealth.

==== Normalized relations ====
De Gaulle&#x27;s resignation in 1969 and, more importantly, the 1970 election of the Liberals in Quebec under Robert Bourassa gave impetus to the calls on both sides for the normalization of France-Canada relations. While the ultra-Gaullists and the remaining members of the &quot;Quebec Mafia&quot; continued occasionally to cause headaches for Canada, such as a 1997 initiative by &quot;Mafia&quot; members to have the French Post Office issue a stamp commemorating de Gaulle&#x27;s 1967 visit to Montreal, relations never again reached anything close to the hostility of the late 1960s.

The Gaullist policy of &quot;dualism&quot; towards Canada, which called for distinct and separate relations between France and Canada and France and Quebec, has been replaced with a purposely ambiguous policy of &quot;ni-ni&quot;, standing for (no interference but no indifference). While the French government continues to maintain cultural and diplomatic ties with Quebec, it is generally careful to treat the federal government with a great deal of respect.

In 2012, French President François Hollande explained that the &quot;ni-ni&quot; policy states &quot;the neutrality of France while ensuring France will accompany Québec in its destinies.&quot;

=== Saint Pierre and Miquelon boundary dispute ===

The maritime boundary between the tiny French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, off the coast of Newfoundland, and Canada has long been a simmering point of contention between the two countries. As each country expanded its claimed territorial limit in the second half of the 20th century, first to and then to , the claims began to overlap, and a maritime boundary needed to be established.

While the countries agreed to a moratorium on undersea drilling in 1967, increased speculation about the existence of large oil deposits combined with the need to diversify economies after the regional cod fishery collapse triggered a new round of negotiations.

In 1989, Canada and France put the boundary question to an international court of arbitration. In 1992, the court awarded France a exclusive economic zone surrounding the islands as well as a long, wide corridor to international waters (an area totalling . This fell significantly short of France&#x27;s claims, and the resulting reduction in fish quotas created a great deal of resentment among the islands&#x27; fishermen until a joint management agreement was reached in 1994.

Former Communications Security Establishment (CSE) agent, Fred Stock, revealed in the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; (May 22, 1999) that Canada had used the surveillance system known as ECHELON to spy on the French government over the boundary issue.

The application of UNCLOS and Article 76 of the Law of the Sea will extend the exclusive economic zone of states by using complex calculations. France is likely to claim a section of the continental shelf south of the corridor granted by the 1992 decision, and a new dispute may arise between France and Canada.

=== Sarkozy, Harper, Charest, and trade policy ===

In the 2007 and 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Quebec Premier Jean Charest all spoke in favour of a Canada–EU free trade agreement. In October 2008, Sarkozy became the first French President to address the National Assembly of Quebec.

== Trade ==
Trade between the two countries is relatively modest, compared to trade with their immediate continental neighbours, but remains significant.
France was in 2010 Canada&#x27;s 11th largest destination for exports and its fourth largest in Europe.

Also, Canada and France are important to each other as entry points to their respective continental free markets (North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union). Moreover, the Montreal-Paris air route is one of the most flown routes between a European and a non-European cities.

While Canada and France often find themselves on the opposite sides of such trade disputes as agricultural free trade and the sale of genetically modified food, they co-operate closely on such issues as the insulation of cultural industries from free trade agreements, something both countries strongly support.

In 2006, France was the seventh ranked destination of Canadian exports (0.7%) and the ninth ranked source of imports to Canada (1.3%).

== Academic and intellectual ==
France is the fifth largest source country for foreign students to Canada (first among European source countries). According to 2003–2004 figures from UNESCO, France is also the fourth most popular destination for Canadian post-secondary students and the most popular non-English-speaking destination. For French post-secondary students, Canada is their fifth most popular destination and the second in terms of non-European destinations.

Haglund and Massie (2010) cite that French-Canadian intellectuals after 1800 developed the theme that Quebec had been abandoned and ignored by France. By the 1970s, there was a reconsideration based on Quebec&#x27;s need for French support. The Association française d&#x27;études canadiennes was formed in 1976 to facilitate international scholarly communication, especially among geographers such as Pierre George, its first president, (1976–1986).

<text>Leiria () is a city and municipality in the Central Region of Portugal. It is the 2nd largest city in that same region, after Coimbra, with a municipality population of 128,640 (as of 2021) in an area of . It is the seat of its own district and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leiria-Fátima. The city is part of the historical province of Beira Litoral.

==History==

The region around Leiria has long been inhabited although its early history is obscure. The first evident inhabitants were the Turduli Oppidani, a Celtici tribe (akin to the Lusitanians), who established a settlement near (around 7 km) present-day Leiria. This settlement was later occupied by the Romans, who expanded it under the original Celtiberian name &quot;Collippo&quot;. The stones of the ancient Roman town were used in the Middle Ages to build much of Leiria.
The name &quot;Leiria&quot; in Portuguese derives from &#x27;leira&#x27; (from the medieval Galician-Portuguese form &#x27;laria&#x27;, from proto-Celtic *ɸlār-yo-, akin to English &#x27;floor(ing)&#x27;, Old Irish &#x27;làr&#x27; &#x27;ground, floor&#x27;, Breton &#x27;leur&#x27; &#x27;ground&#x27;, Welsh &#x27;llawr&#x27; &#x27;floor&#x27;) meaning an area with small farming plots.
It was occupied by the Suebi in 414 until they were forced by the Romans to retreat to Galicia and later incorporated by Leovigild into the Visigoths kingdom in 585 A.D.
Later the Moors occupied the area until it was re-captured by the first King of Portugal, Afonso Henriques in 1135, during the Reconquista. 

South of Leiria in that period was the so-called &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot;, until regions further south (like Santarém and Lisbon) were permanently taken and re-populated by the Christians. In 1142 Afonso Henriques gave Leiria its first &quot;foral&quot; (compilation of feudal rights) to stimulate the colonisation of the region.

Both Afonso I of Portugal and Sancho I rebuilt the walls and the Leiria Castle to avoid new enemy incursions. Most of the population lived inside the protective city walls, but already in the 12th century part of the population lived outside the walls. The oldest church of Leiria, the Church of Saint Peter (&quot;Igreja de São Pedro&quot;), built in romanesque style in the last quarter of the 12th century, served the parish located outside the walls.

During the Middle Ages the importance of the village increased, and it was the setting of several &quot;cortes&quot; (feudal parliaments). The first of the &quot;cortes&quot; held in Leiria took place in 1245, under King Afonso II. In the early 14th century, the king restored the keep tower of the citadel of the castle, as can be seen in an inscription in the tower. He also built a royal residence in Leiria (now lost), and lived for long periods in the town, which he donated as feud to his wife, Elizabeth of Portugal (Rainha Isabel). 

The king also ordered the plantation of the famous Pine Forest of Leiria (&quot;Pinhal de Leiria&quot;) near the coast. Later, the wood from this forest would be used to build the ships used in the Portuguese Navigations of the 15th and 16th centuries.

In the late 14th century, King John I built a royal palace within the walls of the castle of Leiria. This palace, with elegant gothic galleries that offered wonderful views of the town and surrounding landscape, was totally in ruins but was partially rebuilt in the 20th century. 

John I also sponsored the rebuilding in late gothic style of the old Church of Our Lady of the Rock (&quot;Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Pedra&quot;), located inside the castle.

Towards the end of the 15th century the town continued to grow, occupying the area from the castle hill down to the river Lis. King Manuel I gave it a new foral in 1510, and, in 1545, it was elevated to the category of city and became see of a diocese. 

The Cathedral of Leiria was built in the second half of the 16th century in a mix of late manueline and mannerist styles.

Compared to the Middle Ages, the subsequent history of Leiria is of relative decay. The city was stormed by the Peninsular War, namely in the French Invasions of 1808 (the killing of Portela, by the troops of Gen. Margaron) and the Great Fire of 1811, caused by the Napoleonic troops retreating from the Lines of Torres Vedras.

In the 20th century, however, its strategic position in the Portuguese territory favoured the development of a diversified industry.

<text>A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary or used in conjunction with a map or atlas. It typically contains information concerning the geographical makeup, social statistics and physical features of a country, region, or continent. Content of a gazetteer can include a subject&#x27;s location, dimensions of peaks and waterways, population, gross domestic product and literacy rate. This information is generally divided into topics with entries listed in alphabetical order.

Ancient Greek gazetteers are known to have existed since the Hellenistic era. The first known Chinese gazetteer was released by the first century, and with the age of print media in China by the ninth century, the Chinese gentry became invested in producing gazetteers for their local areas as a source of information as well as local pride. The geographer Stephanus of Byzantium wrote a geographical dictionary (which currently has missing parts) in the sixth century which influenced later European compilers. Modern gazetteers can be found in reference sections of most libraries as well as on the internet.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines a &quot;gazetteer&quot; as a &quot;geographical index or dictionary&quot;. It includes as an example a work by the British historian Laurence Echard (d. 1730) in 1693 that bore the title &quot;The Gazetteer&#x27;s: or Newsman&#x27;s Interpreter: Being a Geographical Index&quot;. Echard wrote that the title &quot;Gazetteer&#x27;s&quot; was suggested to him by a &quot;very eminent person&quot; whose name he chose not to disclose. For Part II of this work published in 1704, Echard referred to the book simply as &quot;the Gazeteer&quot;. This marked the introduction of the word &quot;gazetteer&quot; into the English language. Historian Robert C. White suggests that the &quot;very eminent person&quot; written of by Echard was his colleague Edmund Bohun, and chose not to mention Bohun because he became associated with the Jacobite movement.

Since the 18th century, the word &quot;gazetteer&quot; has been used interchangeably to define either its traditional meaning (i.e., a geographical dictionary or directory) or a daily newspaper, such as the &quot;London Gazetteer&quot;.

==Types and organization==
Gazetteers are often categorized by the type, and scope, of the information presented. World gazetteers usually consist of an alphabetical listing of countries, with pertinent statistics for each one, with some gazetteers listing information on individual cities, towns, villages, and other settlements of varying sizes. Short-form gazetteers, often used in conjunction with computer mapping and GIS systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (e.g., British National Grid reference). Short-form gazetteers appear as a place–name index in the rear of major published atlases. Descriptive gazetteers may include lengthy textual descriptions of the places they contain, including explanation of industries, government, geography, together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. Thematic gazetteers list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, nuclear power stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.

Gazetteer editors gather facts and other information from official government reports, the census, chambers of commerce, together with numerous other sources, and organise these in form.

==History==
===Western world===

====Hellenistic and Greco-Roman eras====

In his journal article &quot;Alexander and the Ganges&quot; (1923), the 20th-century historian W.W. Tarn calls a list and description of satrapies of Alexander&#x27;s Empire written between 324 and 323 BC as an ancient gazetteer. Tarn notes that the document is dated no later than June 323 BC, since it features Babylon as not yet partitioned by Alexander&#x27;s generals. It was revised by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC. In the 1st century BC, Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentioned the chronicle-type format of the writing of the logographers in the age before the founder of the Greek historiographic tradition, Herodotus (i.e., before the 480s BC), saying &quot;they did not write connected accounts but instead broke them up according to peoples and cities, treating each separately&quot;. Historian Truesdell S. Brown asserts that what Dionysius describes in this quote about the logographers should be categorized not as a true &quot;history&quot; but rather as a gazetteer. While discussing the Greek conception of the river delta in ancient Greek literature, Francis Celoria notes that both Ptolemy and Pausanias of the 2nd century AD provided gazetteer information on geographical terms.

Perhaps predating Greek gazetteers were those made in ancient Egypt. Although she does not specifically label the document as a gazetteer, Penelope Wilson (Department of Archaeology, Durham University) describes an ancient Egyptian papyrus found at the site of Tanis, Egypt (a city founded during the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt), which provides the following for each administrative area of Egypt at the time:

...the name of a nome capital, its sacred barque, its sacred tree, its cemetery, the date of its festival, the names of forbidden objects, the local god, land, and lake of the city. This interesting codification of data, probably made by a priest, is paralleled by very similar editions of data on the temple walls at Edfu, for example.

====Medieval and early modern eras====
The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; initiated by William I of England in 1086 was a government survey on all the administrative counties of England; it was used to assess the properties of farmsteads and landholders in order to tax them sufficiently. In the survey, numerous English castles were listed; scholars debate on exactly how many were actually referenced in the book. However, the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; does detail the fact that out of 3,558 registered houses destroyed in 112 different boroughs listed, 410 of these destroyed houses were the direct result of castle construction and expansion. In 1316 the Nomina Villarum survey was initiated by Edward II of England; it was essentially a list of all the administrative subdivisions throughout England which could be utilized by the state in order to assess how much military troops could be conscripted and summoned from each region. The &quot;Speculum Britanniae&quot; (1596) of the Tudor era English cartographer and topographer John Norden (1548–1625) had an alphabetical list of places throughout England with headings showing their administrative hundreds and referenced to attached maps. Englishman John Speed&#x27;s &quot;Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine&quot; published in 1611 provided gazetteers for counties throughout England, which included illustrative maps, short local histories, a list of administrative hundreds, an index of parishes, and the coordinates of longitude and latitude for county towns. Starting in 1662, the Hearth Tax Returns with attached maps of local areas were compiled by individual parishes throughout England while a duplicate of their records were sent to the central government offices of the Exchequer. To supplement his &quot;new large Map of England&quot; from 1677, the English cartographer John Adams compiled the extensive gazetteer &quot;Index Villaris&quot; in 1680 that had some 24,000 places listed with geographical coordinates coinciding with the map. The &quot;Geographical Dictionary&quot; of Edmund Bohun was published in London in 1688, comprising 806 pages with some 8,500 entries. In his work, Edmund Bohun attributed the first known Western geographical dictionary to geographer Stephanus of Byzantium (fl. 6th century) while also noting influence in his work from the &quot;Thesaurus Geographicus&quot; (1587) by the Belgian cartographer Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598), but stated that Ortelius&#x27; work dealt largely with ancient geography and not up-to-date information. Only fragments of Stephanus&#x27; geographical work &quot;Ethnica&quot; (Εθνικά) have survived and were first examined by the Italian printer Aldus Manutius in his work of 1502.

The Italian monk Phillippus Ferrarius (d. 1626) published his geographical dictionary &quot;Epitome Geographicus in Quattuor Libros Divisum&quot; in the Swiss city of Zürich in 1605. He divided this work into overhead topics of cities, rivers, mountains, and lakes and swamps. All placenames, given in Latin, were arranged in alphabetical order for each overhead division by geographic type;. A year after his death, his &quot;Lexicon Geographicum&quot; was published, which contained more than 9,000 different entries for geographic places. This was an improvement over Ortelius&#x27; work, since it included modern placenames and places discovered since the time of Ortelius.

Pierre Duval (1618–1683), a nephew of the French cartographer Nicolas Sanson, wrote various geographical dictionaries. These include a dictionary on the abbeys of France, a dictionary on ancient sites of the Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans with their modern equivalent names, and a work published in Paris in 1651 that was both the first universal and vernacular geographical dictionary of Europe. With the gradual expansion of Laurence Echard&#x27;s (d. 1730) gazetteer of 1693, it too became a universal geographical dictionary that was translated into Spanish in 1750, into French in 1809, and into Italian in 1810.

Following the American Revolutionary War, United States clergyman and historian Jeremy Belknap and Postmaster General Ebenezer Hazard intended to create the first post-revolutionary geographical works and gazetteers, but they were anticipated by the clergyman and geographer Jedidiah Morse with his &quot;Geography Made Easy&quot; in 1784. However, Morse was unable to finish the gazetteer in time for his 1784 geography and postponed it. Yet his delay to publish it lasted too long, as it was Joseph Scott in 1795 who published the first post-revolutionary American gazetteer, his &quot;Gazetteer of the United States&quot;. With the aid of Noah Webster and Rev. Samuel Austin, Morse finally published his gazetteer &quot;The American Universal Geography&quot; in 1797. However, Morse&#x27;s gazetteer did not receive distinction by literary critics, as gazetteers were deemed as belonging to a lower literary class. The reviewer of Joseph Scott&#x27;s 1795 gazetteer commented that it was &quot;little more than medleys of politics, history and miscellaneous remarks on the manners, languages and arts of different nations, arranged in the order in which the territories stand on the map&quot;. Nevertheless, in 1802 Morse followed up his original work by co-publishing &quot;A New Gazetteer of the Eastern Continent&quot; with Rev. Elijah Parish, the latter of whom Ralph H. Brown asserts did the &quot;lion&#x27;s share of the work in compiling it&quot;.

====Modern era====
Gazetteers became widely popular in Britain in the 19th century, with publishers such as Fullarton, Mackenzie, Chambers and W &amp; A. K. Johnston, many of whom were Scottish, meeting public demand for information on an expanding Empire. This British tradition continues in the electronic age with innovations such as the National Land and Property Gazetteer, the text-based Gazetteer for Scotland, and the new (2008) National Gazetteer (for Scotland), formerly known as the Definitive National Address – Scotland National Gazetteer. In addition to local or regional gazetteers, there have also been comprehensive world gazetteers published; an early example would be the 1912 world gazetteer published by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. There are also interregional gazetteers with a specific focus, such as the gazetteer of the Swedish atlas &quot;Das Bästas Bilbok&quot; (1969), a road atlas and guide for Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark.

====China====

In Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) China, the &quot;Yuejue Shu&quot; (越絕書) written in 52 AD is considered by modern sinologists and historians to be the prototype of the gazetteer (Chinese: &quot;difangzhi&quot;), as it contained essays on a wide variety of subjects including changes in territorial division, the founding of cities, local products, and customs. However, the first gazetteer proper is considered to be the Chronicles of Huayang by Chang Qu 常璩. There are over 8,000 gazetteers of pre-modern China that have survived. Gazetteers became more common in the Song dynasty (960–1279), yet the bulk of surviving gazetteers were written during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and Qing dynasty (1644–1912). Modern scholar Liu Weiyi notes that just under 400 gazetteers were compiled in the era between the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 and the Tang dynasty (618–907). Gazetteers from this era focused on boundaries and territory, place names, mountains and rivers, ancient sites, local products, local myths and legends, customs, botany, topography, and locations of palaces, streets, temples, etc. By the Tang dynasty the gazetteer became much more geographically specific, with a broad amount of content arranged topically; for example, there would be individual sections devoted to local astronomy, schools, dikes, canals, post stations, altars, local deities, temples, tombs, etc. By the Song dynasty it became more common for gazetteers to provide biographies of local celebrities, accounts of elite local families, bibliographies, and literary anthologies of poems and essays dedicated to famous local spots. Song gazetteers also made lists and descriptions of city walls, gate names, wards and markets, districts, population size, and residences of former prefects.

In 610 after the Sui dynasty (581–618) united a politically divided China, Emperor Yang of Sui had all the empire&#x27;s commanderies prepare gazetteers called &#x27;maps and treatises&#x27; (Chinese: &quot;tujing&quot;) so that a vast amount of updated textual and visual information on local roads, rivers, canals, and landmarks could be utilized by the central government to maintain control and provide better security. Although the earliest extant Chinese maps date to the 4th century BC, and &quot;tujing&quot; since the Qin (221–206 BC) or Han dynasties, this was the first known instance in China when the textual information of &quot;tujing&quot; became the primary element over the drawn illustrations. This Sui dynasty process of providing maps and visual aids in written gazetteers—as well as the submitting of gazetteers with illustrative maps by local administrations to the central government—was continued in every subsequent Chinese dynasty.

Historian James M. Hargett states that by the time of the Song dynasty, gazetteers became far more geared towards serving the current political, administrative, and military concerns than in gazetteers of previous eras, while there were many more gazetteers compiled on the local and national levels than in previous eras. Emperor Taizu of Song ordered Lu Duosun and a team of cartographers and scholars in 971 to initiate the compilation of a huge atlas and nationwide gazetteer that covered the whole of China proper, which comprised approximately 1,200 counties and 300 prefectures. This project was completed in 1010 by a team of scholars under Song Zhun, who presented it in 1,566 chapters to the throne of Emperor Zhenzong. This Sui dynasty process of infrequently collecting &quot;tujing&quot; or &quot;map guides&quot; continued, but it would be enhanced by the matured literary genre of &quot;fangzhi&quot; or &quot;treatise on a place&quot; of the Song dynasty. Although Zheng Qiao of the 12th century did not notice the &quot;fangzhi&quot; while writing his encyclopedic &quot;Tongzhi&quot; including monographs to geography and cities, others such as the bibliographer Chen Zhensun of the 13th century were listing gazetteers instead of the map guides in their works. The main differences between the &quot;fangzhi&quot; and the &quot;tujing&quot; was that the former was a product of &quot;local initiative, not a central command&quot; according to Peter K. Bol, and were usually ten, twenty, or even fifty chapters in length compared to the average four chapters for map guides. Furthermore, the &quot;fangzhi&quot; were almost always printed because they were intended for a large reading audience, whereas &quot;tujing&quot; were exclusive records read by the local officials who drafted them and the central government officials who collected them. Although most Song gazetteers credited local officials as the authors, already in the Song there were bibliographers who noted that non-official literati were asked to compose these works or did so on their own behalf. By the 16th century—during the Ming dynasty—local gazetteers were commonly composed due to local decision-making rather than a central government mandate. Historian Peter K. Bol states that local gazetteers composed in this manner were the result of increased domestic and international trade that facilitated greater local wealth throughout China. Historian R. H. Britnell writes of gazetteers in Ming China, &quot;by the sixteenth century, for a county or monastery not to have a gazetteer was regarded as evidence that the place was inconsequential&quot;.

While working in the Department of Arms, the Tang dynasty cartographer Jia Dan (730–805) and his colleagues would acquire information from foreign envoys about their respective homelands, and from these interrogations would produce maps supplemented by textual information. Even within China, ethnographic information on ethnic minorities of non-Han peoples were often described in the local histories and gazetteers of provinces such as Guizhou during the Ming and Qing dynasties. As the Qing dynasty pushed further with its troops and government authorities into areas of Guizhou that were uninhabited and not administered by the Qing government, the official gazetteers of the region would be revised to include the newly drawn-up districts and non-Han ethnic groups (mostly Miao peoples) therein. While the late Ming dynasty officials who compiled the information on the ethnic groups of Guizhou offered scanty details about them in their gazetteers (perhaps due to their lack of contact with these peoples), the later Qing dynasty gazetteers often provided a much more comprehensive analysis. By 1673 the Guizhou gazetteers featured different written entries for the various Miao peoples of the region. Historian Laura Holsteter writes on the woodblock print illustrations of Miao peoples in the Guizhou gazeteer, stating &quot;the 1692 version of the Kangxi era gazetteer show a refinement in the quality of the illustrations by comparison to 1673&quot;.

Historian Timothy Brook states that Ming dynasty gazetteers demonstrate a shift in the attitudes of Chinese gentry towards the traditionally lower merchant class. As time went on, the gentry solicited funds from merchants to build and repair schools, print scholarly books, build Chinese pagodas on auspicious sites, and other things that were needed by the gentry and scholar-officials in order to succeed. Hence, the gentry figures composing the gazetteers in the latter half of the Ming period spoke favorably of merchants, whereas before they were rarely mentioned. Brook and other modern sinologist historians also examine and consult the local Ming gazetteers to compare population info with the contemporary central government records, which often provided dubious population figures that did not reflect the actually larger population size of China during the time.

Although better known for his work on the &quot;Gujin Tushu Jicheng&quot; encyclopedia, the early-to-mid Qing scholar Jiang Tingxi aided other scholars in the compilation of the &quot;Daqing Yitongzhi&quot; (&#x27;Gazetteer of the Qing Empire&#x27;). This was provided with a preface in 1744 (more than a decade after Jiang&#x27;s death), revised in 1764, and reprinted in 1849.

The Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci created the first comprehensive world map in the Chinese language in the early 17th century, while comprehensive world gazetteers were later translated into Chinese by Europeans. The Christian missionary William Muirhead (1822–1900), who lived in Shanghai during the late Qing period, published the gazetteer &quot;Dili quanzhi&quot;, which was reprinted in Japan in 1859. Divided into fifteen volumes, this work covered Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Ocean Archipelagos, and was sub-divided further into sections on geography, topography, water masses, atmosphere, biology, anthropology, and historical geography. Chinese maritime trade gazetteers mentioned a slew of different countries that came to trade in China, such as United States vessels docking at Canton in the &quot;Yuehaiguanzhi&quot; (&#x27;Gazetteer of the Maritime Customs of Guangdong&#x27;) published in 1839 (reprinted in 1935). The Chinese language gazetteer &quot;Haiguo Tuzhi&quot; (&#x27;Illustrated Gazetteer of the Sea Kingdoms&#x27;) by Wei Yuan in 1844 (with material influenced by the &quot;Sizhou zhi&quot; of Lin Zexu) was printed in Japan two decades later 1854. This work was popular in Japan not for its geographical knowledge, but for its analysis of potential defensive military strategy in the face of European imperialism and the Qing&#x27;s recent defeat in the First Opium War due to European artillery and gunboats.

Continuing an old tradition of &quot;fangzhi&quot;, the Republic of China had gazetteers composed and created national standards for them in 1929, updating these in 1946. The printing of gazetteers was revived in 1956 under Mao Zedong and again in the 1980s, after the reforms of the Deng era to replace the people&#x27;s communes with traditional townships. The &quot;difangzhi&quot; effort under Mao yielded little results (only 10 of the 250 designated counties ended up publishing a gazetteer), while the writing of &quot;difangzhi&quot; was interrupted during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), trumped by the village and family histories which were more appropriate for the theme of class struggle. A Li Baiyu of Shanxi forwarded a letter to the CCP Propaganda Department on May 1, 1979, which urged for the revival of &quot;difangzhi&quot;. This proposal was sponsored by Hu Yaobang in June 1979 while Hu Qiaomu of the CCP Politburo lent his support for the idea in April 1980. The first issue of a modern national journal of &quot;difangzhi&quot; was issued by January 1981.

====Korea====
In Korea, scholars based their gazetteers largely on the Chinese model. Like Chinese gazetteers, there were national, provincial, and local prefecture Korean gazetteers which featured geographic information, demographic data, locations of bridges, schools, temples, tombs, fortresses, pavilions, and other landmarks, cultural customs, local products, resident clan names, and short biographies on well-known people. In an example of the latter, the 1530 edition of &quot;Sinjŭng Tongguk yŏji sŭngnam&quot; (&#x27;Revised Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea&#x27;) gave a brief statement about Pak Yŏn (1378–1458), noting his successful career in the civil service, his exceptional filiality, his brilliance in music theory, and his praisable efforts in systematizing ritual music for Sejong&#x27;s court. King Sejong established the Joseon dynasty&#x27;s first national gazetteer in 1432, called the &quot;Sinch&#x27;an p&#x27;aldo&quot; (&#x27;Newly Compiled Geographic Treatise on the Eight Circuits&#x27;). With additional material and correction of mistakes, the title of this gazetteer was revised in 1454 as the &quot;Sejong Sillok chiriji&quot; (&#x27;King Sejong&#x27;s Treatise on Geography&#x27;), updated in 1531 under the title &quot;Sinjŭng tongguk yŏji sŭngnam&quot;, and enlarged in 1612. The Joseon Koreans also created international gazetteers. The &quot;Yojisongnam&quot; gazetteer compiled from 1451 to 1500 provides a small description for 369 different foreign countries known to Joseon Korea in the 15th century.

====Japan====
In Japan, there were also local gazetteers in pre-modern times, called . Japanese gazetteers preserved historical and legendary accounts of various regions. For example, the Nara-period (710–794) provincial gazetteer &quot;Harima no kuni fūdoki&quot; of Harima Province provides a story of an alleged visit by Emperor Ōjin in the 3rd century while on an imperial hunting expedition. Local Japanese gazetteers could also be found in later periods such as the Edo period. Gazetteers were often composed by the request of wealthy patrons; for example, six scholars in the service of the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Ikeda household published the &quot;Biyō kokushi&quot; gazetteer for several counties in 1737. World gazetteers were written by the Japanese in the 19th century, such as the &quot;Kon&#x27;yo zushiki&quot; (&quot;Annotated Maps of the World&quot;) published by Mitsukuri Shōgo in 1845, the &quot;Hakkō tsūshi&quot; (&quot;Comprehensive Gazetteer of the Entire World&quot;) by Mitsukuri Genpo in 1856, and the &quot;Bankoku zushi&quot; (&quot;Illustrated Gazetteer of the Nations of the World&quot;), which was written by an Englishman named Colton, translated by Sawa Ginjirō, and printed by Tezuka Ritsu in 1862. Despite the ambitious title, the work by Genpo only covered &quot;Yōroppa bu&quot; (&quot;Section on Europe&quot;) while the planned section for Asia was not published. In 1979 the 50 volume gazeteer &quot;Nihon rekishi chimei taikei&quot; (&quot;Japanese Historical Place Names&quot;) series was launched and it is currently also available online with &quot;200,000 headings with detailed explanations of [each] place name&quot;.

===South Asia===
In pre-modern India, local gazetteers were written. For example, Muhnot Nainsi wrote a gazetteer (Nainsi ri Khyat and Marwar rai Pargana ri Vigat) for the Marwar region in the 17th century. B. S. Baliga writes that the history of the gazetteer in Tamil Nadu can be traced back to the classical corpus of Sangam literature, dated 200 BC to 300 AD. Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, the vizier to Akbar the Great of the Mughal Empire, wrote the &quot;Ain-e-Akbari&quot;, which included a gazetteer with valuable information on India&#x27;s population in the 16th century.

===Muslim world===
The pre-modern Islamic world produced gazetteers. Cartographers of the Safavid dynasty of Iran made gazetteers of local areas.

<text>Caldas da Rainha () is a medium-sized Portuguese city in the Oeste region, in the historical province of Estremadura, and in the district of Leiria. The city serves as the seat of the larger municipality of the same name and of the Comunidade Intermunicipal do Oeste (OesteCIM, Intermunicipal Community of the West). At the 2011 census, the municipality had a population of 51,729 in an area of , with 30,343 residing in the city. Although the city itself lies about inland, three of the municipality&#x27;s civil parishes lie on the Atlantic Ocean. Caldas da Rainha is best known for its sulphurous hot springs and ceramic pottery.

The settlement was founded in the 15th century by Queen Leonor (Rainha Dona Leonor), who established a hospital and a church at the site of some therapeutic hot springs. The Hospital Termal Rainha D. Leonor (Queen Leonor Spring Water Hospital, or Thermal Hospital) is the oldest purpose-built institution of its kind in the world, with five centuries of history. The city&#x27;s name, often shortened to simply &quot;Caldas&quot;, can be translated as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Hot Springs&quot;, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Spa&quot;, or &quot;Queen&#x27;s Baths&quot;.

Caldas da Rainha is a UNESCO Creative City. It is home to many cultural institutions. The city&#x27;s nine museums cover art, history, and cycling. Cultural and sports venues include Centro Cultural e de Congressos (CCC, Cultural and Conference Centre), a centre for performing arts, exhibitions, and conferences; Expoeste – Centro de Exposições do Oeste (Exhibition Centre of the West), which hosts exhibitions and festivals; a bullring; several football (soccer) pitches; and a multi-sport municipal complex. Caldas hosts six professional and higher-educational institutions, including a major arts and design school and a school devoted to ceramics.

== History ==

=== Early years ===

Caldas da Rainha was part of the ancient region Lusitania, inhabited by ancient Romans who took advantage of sulphurous waters sprouting in the region. Barbarian invasions destroyed most of the Roman-built baths. By the 13th century, the springs were known as &quot;caldas de Óbidos&quot;, after the nearby town. At this time, a Benedictine order looked after the needs of the poor and cared for the lepers and rheumatics, who sought the healing waters. With the disbandment of the order by the 15th century, the area fell into disrepair.

Queen Leonor (Rainha Dona Leonor, in Portuguese), the wife of King João II, is credited as the founder of Caldas da Rainha. One day in 1484, while traveling from Óbidos to Batalha, she happened upon a group of peasants bathing in foul-smelling waters by the roadside. The queen stopped to inquire about this oddity, and the bathers told her that the waters possessed curative powers. She decided to try them and was pleased to find that she was quickly relieved of an unknown affliction that she had been suffering. On that site, the queen ordered a hospital built so that others could enjoy the same relief. Construction began the following year, and although the first patients were admitted in 1488, the works were not completed until about 1496 or 1497. To finance the hospital and its adjoining church, the queen sold her jewels and used income from her landholdings. The name of the settlement that grew around the site and became Caldas da Rainha refers to both its founder and the reason for its existence. The city&#x27;s name can be translated as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Hot Springs&quot;, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Spa&quot;, or &quot;Queen&#x27;s Baths&quot;. The settlement&#x27;s waters remain its major claim to fame.

On 21 March 1511, King Manuel I, brother of Queen Leonor, conferred the status of town (&quot;vila&quot;) upon Caldas da Rainha. In 1821, it was made a municipality (&quot;concelho&quot; or &quot;município&quot;).

=== Twentieth century ===

In 1901 and 1902, Caldas da Rainha welcomed 350 Boer men, women, and children who sought refuge from the ravages of the Second Boer War in their South African homeland. Initially housed in the thermal hospital, the refugees were transferred to the park pavilions at the onset of the bathing season. Some rented rooms in town, marveling at the low rates.

During World War I, in which Portugal joined the Allies, Caldas had one of three internment camps in the country. In 1916, most Germans in Portugal were deported, but men aged 15–45 were imprisoned to prevent their joining the German military. Originally, all of the approximately 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island in the Azores, where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilhões do Parque). The prisoners were released the following year, after the end of the war.

On 26 April 1919, President João do Canto e Castro granted the town the title of Dame of the Military Order of the Tower and of the Sword, of Valour, Loyalty and Merit (Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada do Valor, Lealdade e Mérito). Unlike other places similarly honoured, Caldas did not add the honour&#x27;s collar to its coat of arms. The town was elevated to the status of city (&quot;cidade&quot;) in August 1927.

During World War II, in which Portugal remained neutral, hundreds of Jewish refugees came to Caldas da Rainha to escape Nazism. Caldas also served as home to British and American airmen who landed or crashed in Portugal or off its coast. In January 1943, 230 Britons resident in Axis power Italy were evacuated to Caldas, where they were expected to stay until the end of the war. Most of these evacuees were over 65 years of age and had resided in Italy for a long time.

In a prelude to the Carnation Revolution, in the early morning of 16 March 1974, the Fifth Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria 5), based in Caldas da Rainha in what is now the School of Army Sergeants (Escola de Sargentos do Exército), attempted to stage a coup d&#x27;état against the country&#x27;s authoritarian Estado Novo regime. Thirty officers and about 300 sergeants and enlisted men from the regiment left their quarters at 4:00 a.m., heading for Lisbon, where they planned to occupy the airport. On approaching the capital, the Caldas regiment found themselves alone, realizing that the other units supposed to participate in the coup had not joined the upheaval. The regiment turned back and reached their Caldas quarters at around 10:00 a.m., locking themselves in and awaiting a siege. The compound was surrounded by various forces, which penetrated the base at about 5:00 p.m. The revolters were arrested and sent to various military prisons, where they were held until the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974, 40 days later.

=== Symbols ===

Caldas da Rainha&#x27;s coat of arms was granted by Queen Leonor, before municipal coats of arms were typically used in Portugal. The centre of the city&#x27;s arms consist of the queen&#x27;s personal arms, flanked on the right by a shrimping net, to commemorate the fishermen who rescued her drowning son Prince Afonso, and on the left a pelican feeding its young, a symbol of her husband, King João II. Because of its early introduction, several elements of the arms violate Portuguese heraldic standards. The municipal flag consists of the coat of arms on a purple and yellow gyronny.

The municipality adopted a logo for marketing purposes, to project an image of &quot;relevant historical tradition&quot;, &quot;current dynamism&quot;, and &quot;enormous potential in culture, economy, commerce, and tourism&quot;. The logo shows a stylised outline of Queen Leonor&#x27;s crowned head in blue tones, representing the city&#x27;s historical connection with water. Below the queen&#x27;s image, the municipality&#x27;s name appears in all caps in Eras Light. Below this &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot; is written in Gill Sans.

Caldas da Rainha has 12 &quot;freguesias&quot; (civil parishes). Before 29 January 2013, Caldas had 16 civil parishes. On that date, a law came into effect causing the number of civil parishes throughout the country to be reduced. Seven of the municipality&#x27;s civil parishes were combined into three new &quot;unions of civil parishes&quot; (&quot;uniões de freguesias&quot;, singular: &quot;união de freguesias&quot;).

Nossa Senhora do Pópulo and Santo Onofre are separated by the Linha do Oeste (Western Line) railway line, as specified in the 1984 law (effective 1 January 1985) that carved Santo Onofre out of the civil parish that was called Caldas da Rainha at that time.

=== Traditions ===
Caldas da Rainha is well known for its glazed ceramic pottery (&quot;louça das Caldas&quot;). &quot;The New York Times&quot; has called Caldas &quot;[t]he capital of Portuguese pottery&quot;. The city is at &quot;the center of a region rich in clay&quot;, where pottery has been made since the Neolithic Era. Caldas gained fame for its ceramic wares when Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro and his brother Feliciano founded their Fábrica de Faianças, now called Faianças Artísticas Bordallo Pinheiro. The factory&#x27;s output includes large decorative pieces; tableware shaped like fruits, vegetables, and animals; and figurines of Zé Povinho, a bearded peasant everyman character. Caldas has a tradition of ceramic phalluses dating to the late 19th century.

Caldas has a tradition of embroidery (&quot;bordado&quot;) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor&#x27;s handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft&#x27;s common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.

Caldas has several traditional sweets. &quot;Cavacas das Caldas&quot; are a small-bowl-sized, confection of flour and eggs, with a crunchy sugar covering. In June 2005, a pyramid containing 48,900 &quot;cavacas&quot; was erected on Praça 25 de Abril in front of the city hall. &quot;Beijinhos das Caldas&quot; (&quot;little kisses&quot;) are similar, but are smaller and spherical. Other local sweets include &quot;trouxas de ovos&quot; (poached eggs), &quot;lampreias de ovos&quot; (egg lampreys), and &quot;pão-de-ló do Landal&quot; (Landal sponge cake). Savory dishes typical of Caldas include &quot;ensopado de enguias da lagoa&quot; (stewed lagoon eels), &quot;bacalhau à lagareiro&quot; (cod in olive oil), &quot;polvo à lagareiro&quot; (octopus in olive oil), and &quot;fatias de carne frita à moda do Landal&quot; (Landal-style sliced fried meat).

<doc id="307631" wikidata="Q199427" url="?curid=307631" title="Great white pelican">
<text>The great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) also known as the eastern white pelican, rosy pelican or simply white pelican is a bird in the pelican family. It breeds from southeastern Europe through Asia and Africa, in swamps and shallow lakes.

The great white pelican has been rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species (IUCN). It is listed under Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, Annexure I under the EU Birds Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds, and Appendix II of the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. It is also listed within 108 Special Protection Areas in the European Union. It occurs within 43 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in its European range. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) is applied.

==Taxonomy==
The great white pelican was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Pelecanus onocrotalus&quot;. The species is treated as monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The specific epithet &quot;onocrotalus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;pelican&quot;.

==Description==


The great white pelican is a huge birdonly the Dalmatian pelican is, on average, larger among pelicans. It measures in length with a enormous pink and yellow bill, and a dull pale-yellow gular pouch. The wingspan measures , the latter measurement being the highest among extant flying animals outside of the great albatross. The adult male measures about in length; it weighs from and larger races from the Palaearctic are usually around , with few exceeding . It has a bill measuring . The female measures about in length, and is considerably less bulky, weighing , and has a bill that measures in length. In Lake Edward, Uganda, the average weight of 52 males was found to be and in 22 females it was . In South Africa, the average weight of males was and of females was . Thus the sexual dimorphism is especially pronounced in this species (perhaps the greatest known in any extant pelican), as at times the male can average more than 30% more massive than the female. The great white pelican rivals the kori bustard, which has even more pronounced sexual dimorphism, as the heaviest flying bird to reside in Africa (both averaging perhaps slightly heavier than the cape vulture and the wattled crane). There are a small few slightly heavier flying birds in the Eurasian portions of the range. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail , and the tarsus long. Standard measurements from different areas indicate that pelicans from the Western Palaearctic are somewhat larger than those from Asia and Africa.

The male has a downward bend in the neck and the female has a shorter, straighter beak. The plumage is predominantly white except on remiges, with a faint pink tinge on the neck and a yellowish base on the foreneck. The primary feathers are black, with white shafts at the bases, occasionally with paler tips and narrow fringes. The secondary feathers are also black, but with a whitish fringe. The upperwing coverts, underwing coverts, and tertials are white. The forehead is swollen and pinkish skin surrounds the bare, dark eyes having brown-red to dark brown irides. It has fleshy-yellow legs and pointed forehead-feathers where meeting the culmen. In breeding season, the male has pinkish skin while the female has orangey skin on its face. The bill is mostly bluish grey, with a red tip, reddish maxilla edges, and a cream-yellow to yolk-yellow gular pouch. The white plumage becomes tinged-pink with a yellow patch on the breast, and the body is tinged yellowish-rosy. It also has a short, shaggy crest on the nape. The white covert feathers contrast with the solid black primary and secondary feathers. The legs are yellow-flesh to pinkish orange. Both male and female are similar, but the female is smaller and has brighter orange facial skin in the breeding season.

The juvenile has darker, brownish underparts that are palest at the rump, center of the belly, and uppertail coverts. The underwing coverts are mostly dull-white, but the greater coverts are dark and there is a dark brownish bar over the lesser coverts. The rear tertials upperwing coverts mostly have paler tips with a silvery-grey tinge on the greater secondary coverts and tertials. It has dark flight feathers, and brown-edged wings. The head, neck, and upperparts, including the upperwing coverts, are mostly brownthis is the darkest part of the neck. The facial skin and the bill, including its gular pouch, are greyish to dusky greyish. The forehead, rump, and abdomen are white, and its legs and feet are grey. Its blackish tail occasionally has a silvery-grey tinge. Its underparts and back are initially browner and darker than those of the Dalmatian pelican, and the underwing is strongly patterned, similar to the juvenile brown pelican.

The great white pelican is distinguished from all other pelicans by its plumage. Its face is naked and the feathering on its forehead tapers to a fine point, whereas other species are completely feathered. In flight, the white underwing with black remiges of the adult are similar only to those of the American white pelican (&quot;P. erythrorhynchos&quot;), but the latter has white inner secondary feathers. It differs from the Dalmatian pelican in its pure white rather than greyish-white plumage, a bare pink facial patch around the eye, and pinkish legs. The spot-billed pelican (&quot;P. philippensis&quot;) of Asia is slightly smaller than the great white pelican, with greyish tinged white plumage, and a paler, duller-colored bill. Similarly, the pink-backed pelican (&quot;P. rufescens&quot;) is smaller, with brownish-grey plumage, a light pink to off-grey bill, and a pinkish wash on the back.

The bird is mostly silent but has a variety of low-pitched lowing, grunting, and growling calls. The flight call is a deep, quiet croak., while at breeding colonies, it gives deep &quot;moooo&quot; calls.

==Distribution and habitat==

The breeding range of the great white pelican extends to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Chad, northern Cameroons, and Nigeria in Africa, and has been observed or reported breeding in Zambia, Botswana, and South Africa. In the 1990s, 6,700 to 11,000 breeding pairs in 23 to 25 breeding sites, were found in the Palearctic region. A 1991 study noted about 3,070 to 4,300 pairs were present in the Soviet Union. Only two breeding colonies are located in the Mediterranean basin, one having 250 to 400 pairs in Turkey and the other having 50 to 100 pairs in northern Greece. The breeding colony at Lake Rukwa, Tanzania is the largest known breeding colony in Africa, followed by the Lake Shala, Ethiopia colony which is probably of crucial importance to the species in Africa.
The African population of about 75,000 pairs of the great white pelican is resident. The ones breeding in the Palearctic region are migrants, although it is possible that the majority of the western Palearctic populations stop-over in Israel during their autumn migration. The migration routes are only partially known. Migratory populations are found from Eastern Europe to Kazakhstan during the breeding season. More than 50% of Eurasian great white pelicans breed in the Danube Delta in Romania. They also prefer staying in the Lakes near Burgas, Bulgaria and in Srebarna Lake in Bulgaria. The pelicans arrive in the Danube in late March or early April and depart after breeding from September to late November. Wintering locations for European pelicans are not exactly known but wintering birds may occur in northeastern Africa through Iraq to north India, with a particularly large number of breeders from Asia wintering around Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Northern populations migrate to China, India, Myanmar, with stragglers reaching Java and Bali in Indonesia. These are birds that are found mostly in lowlands, though in East Africa and Nepal may be found living at elevations of up to .

Overall, the great white pelican is one of the most widely distributed species. Although some areas still hold quite large colonies, it ranks behind the brown pelican and possibly the Australian pelican in overall abundance. Europe now holds an estimated 7,345–10,000 breeding pairs, with over 4,000 pairs that are known to nest in Russia. During migration, more than 75,000 have been observed in Israel and, in winter, over 45,000 may stay in Pakistan. In all its colonies combined, 75,000 pairs are estimated to nest in Africa. It is possibly extinct in Serbia and Montenegro, and regionally extinct in Hungary.

Great white pelicans usually prefer shallow, (seasonally or tropical) warm fresh water. Well scattered groups of breeding pelicans occur through Eurasia from the eastern Mediterranean to Vietnam. In Eurasia, fresh or brackish waters may be inhabited and the pelicans may be found in lakes, deltas, lagoons and marshes, usually with dense reed beds nearby for nesting purposes. Additionally, sedentary populations are found year-round in Africa, south of the Sahara Desert although these are patchy. In Africa, great white pelicans occur mainly around freshwater and alkaline lakes and may also be found in coastal, estuarine areas. Beyond reed beds, African pelicans have nested on inselbergs and flat inshore islands off of Banc d&#x27;Arguin National Park.

==Behavior==
The great white pelican is highly sociable and often forms large flocks. It is well adapted for aquatic life. The short strong legs and webbed feet propel it in water and aid a rather awkward takeoff from the water surface. In flight, it is an elegant soaring bird, with the head held close to and aligned with the body. Its flight consists of a few slow wingbeats followed by a glide. Once aloft, the long-winged pelicans are powerful fliers, however, and often travel in spectacular linear, circular, or V-formation groups.

=== Feeding ===

The great white pelican mainly eats fish. It leaves its roost to feed early in the morning and may fly over in search of food, as has been observed in Chad and in Mogode, Cameroon. It needs from of fish every day, which corresponds to around annual fish consumption at the largest colony of the great white pelican, on Tanzania&#x27;s Lake Rukwa (with almost 75,000 birds). Fish targeted are usually fairly large ones, in the weight range and up to , and are taken based on regional abundance. Common carp are preferred in Europe, mullets in China, and Arabian toothcarp in India. In Africa, often the commonest cichlids, including many species in the &quot;Haplochromis&quot; and &quot;Tilapia&quot; genera, seem to be preferred.

The pelican&#x27;s pouch serves simply as a scoop. As the pelican pushes its bill underwater, the lower bill bows out, creating a large pouch which fills with water and fish. As it lifts its head, the pouch contracts, forcing out the water but retaining the fish. A group of 6 to 8 great white pelicans gather in a horseshoe formation in water to feed together. They dip their bills in unison, creating a circle of open pouches, ready to trap every fish in the area. Most feeding is cooperative and done in groups, especially in shallow waters where fish schools can be corralled easily, though they may also forage alone as well.

Great white pelicans are not restricted to fish, however, and are often opportunistic foragers. In some situations, they eat chicks of other birds, such as the well documented case off the southwest coast of South Africa. Here, breeding pelicans from the Dassen Island prey on chicks weighing up to from the Cape gannet colony on Malgas Island. Similarly, in Walvis Bay, Namibia the eggs and chicks of Cape cormorants are fed regularly to young pelicans. The local pelican population is so reliant on the cormorants, that when the cormorant species experienced a population decline, the numbers of pelicans appeared to decline as well.

They also rob other birds of their prey. During periods of starvation, they also eat seagulls and ducklings. The gulls are held under water and drowned before being eaten headfirst. A flock of captive great white pelicans in St James&#x27;s Park, London is well known for occasionally eating local pigeons, despite being well-fed.

===Breeding===

The breeding season commences in April or May in temperate zones, is essentially all year around in Africa, and runs February through April in India. Large numbers of these pelicans breed together in colonies. Nest locations vary: some populations make stick nests in trees but a majority, including all those that breed in Africa, nest exclusively in scrapes on the ground lined with grass, sticks, feathers, and other material.

The female can lay from 1 to 4 eggs in a clutch, with two being the average. Incubation takes 29 to 36 days. The chicks are naked when they hatch but quickly sprout blackish-brown down. The young are cared for by both parents. The colony gathers in &quot;pods&quot; around 20 to 25 days after the eggs hatch. The young fledge at 65 to 75 days of age. Around 64% of young successful reach adulthood, attaining sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years of age.

=== Predators ===
Predators of the pelicans&#x27; eggs and chicks include mammalian animals like foxes, gulls, frigatebirds, crows, skuas, African fish eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus vocifer&quot;), and marabou storks (&quot;Leptoptilos crumenifer&quot;). The adults have few predators on land other than humans and has no marine predator. However, in some regions of Africa, terrestrial predation occurs at night while roosting, caused by jackals, hyenas and lions. Additionally, crocodiles, especially Nile crocodiles reportedly taken swimming pelicans.

== Status and conservation ==
Since 1998, the great white pelican has been rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it has a large range more than and because its population is thought not to have declined by 30% over ten years or three generations, which is not a rapid enough decline to warrant a vulnerable rating. However, the state of its overall population is not known, and although it is widespread, it is not abundant anywhere. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. It is listed under the Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, Appendix II of the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and Annexure I of the EU Birds Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. It occurs within 43 Important Bird Areas in its European range, and is listed within 108 Special Protection Areas in the European Union. This species is often kept in captivity in zoos or in semi-wild colonies such as that in St. James&#x27;s Park, London. The ancestors of this colony were originally given to Charles II by the Russian ambassador in 1664 which initiated the tradition of ambassadors donating the birds.

Today, because of overfishing in certain areas, white pelicans are forced to fly long distances to find food. Adult birds can abandon breeding colonies due to the shortage of food supply. Also, human disturbance forced pelicans to leave their colonies temporarily, leaving chicks vulnerable to predation. Great white pelicans are exploited for many reasons. Their pouch is used to make tobacco bags, their skin is turned into leather, the guano is used as fertiliser, and the fat of its young is converted into oils for traditional medicine in China and India. In Ethiopia, great white pelicans are shot for their meat. Human disturbance, loss of foraging habitat and breeding sites, as well as pollution are all contributing to the decline of the great white pelican. Declines have been particularly notable in the Palaearctic.
