<text>Terry Wallace (born 13 December 1958) is a former professional Australian rules football player and coach.

As a player, his career spanned three VFL/AFL clubs; most notably Hawthorn where he played in three premierships. After one season with Richmond, he then played with Footscray Football Club where he earned two Best and Fairest awards. He also achieved one All-Australian selection when representing the VFA at the 1988 National Carnival.

As coach, he took the Western Bulldogs from 15th in 1996 to 3rd when he featured in the documentary &quot;Year of the Dogs&quot; a position in which the club held in 1997 and 1998 during which he was named coach of the All-Australian team. Wallace&#x27;s coaching style is considered to be innovative and he is credited with having started the modern practice of sides warming up on the field before a match. However Wallace&#x27;s coaching career at Richmond between 2005 and 2009 was not so successful, and he stepped down from coaching in June 2009.

His son, Brent Wallace, is currently a field umpire in the AFL.

==Playing career==
===Hawthorn===
Wallace was a centreman for Hawthorn Football Club from 1978 until 1986, where he played a total number of 174 games for the club and kicked a total of 96 goals. Recruited from VFA club Camberwell, he was a member of Hawthorn&#x27;s 1978 premiership side in what was his debut season. Nicknamed &#x27;Plough&#x27; for his knack of crashing through packs, Wallace was Hawthorn&#x27;s best and fairest winner in 1981 and 1983. In 1983, Wallace was member of the Hawthorn premiership side. He played in one further premiership side at Hawthorn in 1986. Often polling well in the Brownlow Medal counts, Wallace finished equal third in 1982 and equal sixth in 1983.

===Richmond===
After a contractual dispute with Hawthorn at the end of 1986, Wallace received a clearance to move to the Richmond Football Club but struggled in his only season with the club in 1987, where he played a total number of 11 games for the club and kicked a total of 7 goals. Wallace eventually ended the year prematurely with a back injury.

===Footscray===
He finished his playing career with four seasons at Footscray from 1988 until 1991 for a total of 69 games and kicked 20 goals, which yielded back to back Charles Sutton Medals in 1988 and 1989.

==Coaching career==

===Western Bulldogs===
In the middle of the 1996 AFL season, he took over as the Western Bulldogs senior coach, following the sacking of incumbent senior coach Alan Joyce. At the end of the 1996 season, they finished 15th. In the 1997 season, Wallace quickly rebuilt the side, finishing third at the end of the season. In the first qualifying final they defeated Sydney but then lost in the preliminary final to Adelaide. In 1998, the Bulldogs under Wallace finished second at the end of the season. In the qualifying finals, they defeated the West Coast Eagles but lost in the preliminary final to Adelaide for the second year in a row.

In the 1999 AFL season, Wallace led the Bulldogs to fourth at the end of the season but in the qualifying finals they lost to West Coast then in the semi-finals they lost to the Brisbane Lions. In the 2000 AFL season the Bulldogs under Wallace finished seventh but in the elimination finals they were knocked out by the Brisbane Lions. During this season the Bulldogs were the only team to defeat in a match that became known as the &quot;Super-Flood&quot; as Wallace employed &quot;flooding&quot; tactics against the Essendon forwards. In the 2001 AFL season, the Bulldogs under Wallace struggled and finished tenth and then the Bulldogs under Wallace kept struggling in the 2002 season, sitting at thirteenth on the ladder with eight wins, one draw and twelve losses after Round 21, 2002. Wallace resigned as Bulldogs senior coach at the end of the 2002 season with one match left to go. Assistant coach Peter Rohde then replaced Wallace in a caretaker senior coaching role to coach the last game for the 2002 season in Round 22, 2002 against Collingwood, which the Bulldogs won and after this Rohde was eventually employed full-time senior coach.

Wallace was linked to the Sydney Swans job in mid-2002 when Rodney Eade was sacked following a narrow round 12 loss to Geelong. It was rumoured that there was a verbal agreement that the Swans would appoint him as their senior coach for the 2003 season. But Wallace was not given the Swans job and it went to then-caretaker senior coach Paul Roos, despite Wallace resigning as senior coach of the Bulldogs with one match remaining in the 2002 season.

=== Richmond ===

In August 2004, he was appointed the senior coach of Richmond for five seasons from 2005, replacing Danny Frawley.

His first year at Richmond was unsuccessful, as the club under Wallace finished twelfth at the end of the 2005 season despite spending most of the first half of the season in the top eight, mostly in the top four. In the 2006 season, Richmond under Wallace with three straight crushing defeats at the start of the season placed them at the bottom of the ladder, but they recovered to win five out of the next seven games, including a famous tactical win against the Adelaide Crows, who were on top of the AFL ladder at the time, using extreme possession retention and tempo tactics; but they did not make the finals, just missing out and finishing ninth at the end of the 2006 season.

The 2007 season proved to be Wallace&#x27;s worst at any club. The Tigers lost the first five games of the season by less than 25 points and maintained leads in many of those games going into the final quarter. However, in Round 6, 2007, the Tigers were soundly defeated by the eventual premiers, Geelong, at the Telstra Dome by a record margin of 157 points. This subsequently led to the board and management formally apologizing to supporters at Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Tuesdays with Terry&quot; press conference. Richmond under Wallace won only three games to finish sixteenth in last position on the ladder for the wooden spoon position at the end of the 2007 season. 

The 2008 season was a vital year for Wallace in relation to his future at the club. Brett Deledio said that the club had to make the top eight at all costs in order to repay the faith shown by supporters. The season was a big improvement with Richmond starting off with a win over Carlton in Round 1. But the team did not make the finals with Richmond under Wallace finishing ninth at the end of the 2008 season with eleven wins, ten losses and one draw.

Mounting speculation and reports of a rift with Richmond president Gary March were reported at the conclusion of the home and away season, mainly due to conflicting assessments of the sides performance between coach and president. These issues were denied by the club and coach. The appointment of Kevin Sheedy to a marketing role at Richmond following Sheedy&#x27;s departure as Essendon Football club senior coach also resulted in more pressure on Wallace to deliver the Tigers a much overdue finals appearance in 2009.

At the start of the 2009 season, Wallace was still under pressure after Richmond&#x27;s 83-point loss against Carlton in Round 1 and further losses to Geelong, the Western Bulldogs and cellar-dwellers Melbourne. Despite controversial media reports describing Wallace as a &#x27;dead man walking&#x27;, he told a packed media conference after the Round 4, 2009 loss to Melbourne that he would not be resigning and would coach out the 2009 season at Richmond, the final year of his five-year contract. A subsequent Richmond Football Club board meeting gave Wallace a reprieve until mid-season before deciding his fate. However later in the 2009 season, Richmond under Wallace kept struggling and sat fifteenth (second-last) position on the ladder after Round 10, 2009 with two wins and eight losses. Wallace then announced his resignation as senior coach of Richmond Football Club on 1 June 2009, but would coach one more game. Public scrutiny aimed towards Wallace is a main factor contributing to his resignation.

Wallace&#x27;s last game as senior coach of the Richmond Tigers in Round 11, 2009, resulted in a loss against the Western Bulldogs, with the final score Richmond 14.5 (89) and Western Bulldogs 24.13 (157). Assistant coach Jade Rawlings then replaced Wallace and served as caretaker senior coach for the remainder of the 2009 season.

==Media career==
During the period from 2003 until 2004, when Wallace was not coaching, he became a prominent media personality with roles on Fox Footy channel, and as a columnist in Melbourne newspaper the Herald Sun, which he still maintains. After his coaching career ended, Wallace returned to his media career and Wallace has also worked for Fox Footy, Channel 9, Seven Network, Sky News Australia, 3AW and for the past period for SEN.

<doc id="312151" wikidata="Q2722353" url="?curid=312151" title="St Neot, Cornwall">
<text>St Neot ( ) () is a village and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The parish population at the 2011 census was 947. It is between the towns of Bodmin and Liskeard.

The parish is named after the Saxon monk, Saint Neot (who also gives his name to St Neots in Cambridgeshire, to where his alleged bones were taken in the early Middle Ages), and means &quot;pleasant (or beautiful) pasture (or habitation)&quot; in Hebrew. On the northern side the parish includes part of Bodmin Moor and hamlets in the parish include Draynes, Ley and Pantersbridge.

==History and antiquities==

Arthur Langdon (1896) records eight Cornish crosses and two cross bases in the parish. Four-hole Cross is located by the main Launceston to Bodmin road close to the milestone showing eight miles to Bodmin. The shaft is ornamented on all four sides. The other crosses are three in the vicarage garden, another in the village, another in the churchyard (its shaft is ornamented on all four sides with interlaced carving), and others at Hilltown and Newtown.

The manor of St Neot was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) when it was held by Odo from Robert, Count of Mortain; it had been held by Godric the priest before 1066. The Count had taken this land away from the clergy of St Neot. There was one hide of land which never paid tax and land for 5 ploughs. There were 1 plough, 3 serfs, 3 villeins, 6 smallholders, 2 cattle, 2 pigs and 30 sheep. The value of the manor was 5 shillings though it had formerly been worth £1 sterling. The priests of St Neot had only one acre of their former land. There were 4 smallholders, 1 ox, 10 goats and 20 sheep.

During the English Civil War St Neot was staunchly Royalist. To commemorate this, each year on Oak Apple Day (29 May), an oak branch is mounted on the top of the church tower to symbolise the historical allegiance.

John Anstis, born and buried at St Neot, was an English officer of arms and antiquarian who rose to the highest heraldic office in England and became Garter King of Arms in 1718. Henry Dangar (1796–1861) was a native of St Neot who became a surveyor and explorer of Australia.

No railway was ever built to the village, despite pressure from local people and mine owners in the 1860s and 1870s. Instead, Doublebois railway station was opened on 1 June 1860 about two miles south of St Neot on the Cornwall Railway main line.

==Parish Church of St Neot==

The original dedication may have been to &#x27;St Anietus&#x27;, with whom the Saxon Neot has been confused. In the 11th century a small monastery stood here; the early medieval church building (of which the tower remains) must have been smaller than the current church. Rebuilding in granite was undertaken in the 15th century, and the stained-glass windows – described as &quot;high quality&quot; by Historic England – are from about 1500. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1987.

The stained glass is partly original and partly from restoration in the 1820s, which was designed by John Hedgeland and painted by James Nixon, both of London. The 16 windows are as follows; they are of 15th- or 16th-century workmanship unless indicated. 1: the Creation window; 2: the Noah window; 3: the Borlase window; 4: the Martyn window; 5: the Motton window; 6: the Callawy window; 7: the Tubbe and Callawy window; 8: an armorial window (Hedgeland); 9: the St George window (15th century); 10: the St Neot window (12 episodes from the legend); 11: the Young Women&#x27;s window (four saints with the 20 donors below); 12: the Wives&#x27; window (Christ and three saints with the 20 donors below); 13: the Harris window; 14: the Redemption window (Hedgeland); 15: the Acts window (Hedgeland); 16: the chancel window, which depicts the Last Supper (Hedgeland; copied from the earliest representation in the British Museum).

Nearby is the holy well of St Neot. Legend tells that the well contained three fish, and an angel told St Neot that as long as he ate no more than one fish a day, their number would never decrease. At a time St Neot fell ill, and his servant went and cooked two of the fish; upon finding this, St Neot prayed for forgiveness and ordered that the fish be returned to the well. As they entered the water, both were miraculously returned to life.

==Other notable buildings==
Two 15th-century bridges are at Pantersbridge and Treverbyn (crossing the Warleggan and Fowey rivers). Lewarne is a neo-Tudor country house built for the Grylls family in 1869. Treverbyn Vean is a Victorian mansion designed for Colonel Charles Sommers Cocks by two of the greatest Victorian architects, George Gilbert Scott and William Burges. A. G. Langdon (1896) records six stone crosses in the parish, of which three are at the vicarage.

The nearby Carnglaze Caverns, a former slate quarry, forms an unusual music venue.

==Village Award==

In 2004 and 2006, the village of St Neot won the National Calor Village of the Year award. St Neot also won the Calor Gas Village of the Decade award, which celebrated 10 years of the competition.

==Cornish wrestling==
St Neot has hosted Cornish wrestling tournaments for prizes in at least the 1800s.

John Charles Corse (1825–1872), originally from St Neot was a champion Cornish wrestler who emigrated to Australia and was known as the &quot;Sydney Champion&quot;. He was a blacksmith and claimed to have thrown Gundry, the famous wrestler, before emigrating. In 1852 he was champion of New South Wales and beat Hodge in a high-profile challenge match taking the Australian title. He successfully defended the title in 1856 against Burns. He became champion of Victoria and was Cornish wrestling champion of Australia in 1857. He was murdered by being shot in the back of the head.

<doc id="312152" wikidata="Q2254570" url="?curid=312152" title="Spontaneous process">
<text>In thermodynamics, a spontaneous process is a process which occurs without any external input to the system. A more technical definition is the time-evolution of a system in which it releases free energy and it moves to a lower, more thermodynamically stable energy state (closer to thermodynamic equilibrium). The sign convention for free energy change follows the general convention for thermodynamic measurements, in which a release of free energy from the system corresponds to a negative change in the free energy of the system and a positive change in the free energy of the surroundings.

Depending on the nature of the process, the free energy is determined differently. For example, the Gibbs free energy change is used when considering processes that occur under constant pressure and temperature conditions, whereas the Helmholtz free energy change is used when considering processes that occur under constant volume and temperature conditions. The value and even the sign of both free energy changes can depend upon the temperature and pressure or volume.

Because spontaneous processes are characterized by a decrease in the system&#x27;s free energy, they do not need to be driven by an outside source of energy.

For cases involving an isolated system where no energy is exchanged with the surroundings, spontaneous processes are characterized by an increase in entropy.

A &quot;spontaneous reaction&quot; is a chemical reaction which is a spontaneous process under the conditions of interest.

==Overview==
In general, the spontaneity of a process only determines whether or not a process &quot;can&quot; occur and makes no indication as to whether or not the process &quot;will&quot; occur at an observable rate. In other words, spontaneity is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a process to actually occur. Furthermore, spontaneity makes no implication as to the speed at which the spontaneous process may occur - just because a process is spontaneous does not mean it will happen quickly (or at all).

As an example, the conversion of a diamond into graphite is a spontaneous process at room temperature and pressure. Despite being spontaneous, this process does not occur since the energy to break the strong carbon-carbon bonds is larger than the release in free energy. Another way to explain this would be that even though the conversion of diamond into graphite is thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous even at room temperature, the high activation energy of this reaction renders it too slow to observe.

==Using free energy to determine spontaneity==
For a process that occurs at constant temperature and pressure, spontaneity can be determined using the change in Gibbs free energy, which is given by:

formula_1

where the sign of Δ&quot;G&quot; depends on the signs of the changes in enthalpy (Δ&quot;H&quot;) and entropy (Δ&quot;S&quot;). If these two signs are the same (both positive or both negative), then the sign of Δ&quot;G&quot; will change from positive to negative (or vice versa) at the temperature 

In cases where Δ&quot;G&quot; is:
* negative, the process is spontaneous and may proceed in the forward direction as written.
* positive, the process is non-spontaneous as written, but it may proceed spontaneously in the &quot;reverse direction&quot;.
* zero, the process is at equilibrium, with no net change taking place over time.

This set of rules can be used to determine four distinct cases by examining the signs of the Δ&quot;S&quot; and Δ&quot;H&quot;.
* When Δ&quot;S&quot; &gt; 0 and Δ&quot;H&quot; &lt; 0, the process is always spontaneous as written.
* When Δ&quot;S&quot; &lt; 0 and Δ&quot;H&quot; &gt; 0, the process is never spontaneous, but the reverse process is always spontaneous.
* When Δ&quot;S&quot; &gt; 0 and Δ&quot;H&quot; &gt; 0, the process will be spontaneous at high temperatures and non-spontaneous at low temperatures. 
* When Δ&quot;S&quot; &lt; 0 and Δ&quot;H&quot; &lt; 0, the process will be spontaneous at low temperatures and non-spontaneous at high temperatures.

For the latter two cases, the temperature at which the spontaneity changes will be determined by the relative magnitudes of Δ&quot;S&quot; and Δ&quot;H&quot;.

==Using entropy to determine spontaneity==
When using the entropy change of a process to assess spontaneity, it is important to carefully consider the definition of the system and surroundings. The second law of thermodynamics states that a process involving an isolated system will be spontaneous if the entropy of the system increases over time. For open or closed systems, however, the statement must be modified to say that the total entropy of the &quot;combined&quot; system and surroundings must increase, or,
formula_2

This criterion can then be used to explain how it is possible for the entropy of an open or closed system to decrease during a spontaneous process. A decrease in system entropy can only occur spontaneously if the entropy change of the surroundings is both positive in sign and has a larger magnitude than the entropy change of the system:
formula_3
and
formula_4

In many processes, the increase in entropy of the surroundings is accomplished via heat transfer from the system to the surroundings (i.e. an exothermic process).

<doc id="312153" wikidata="Q1637432" url="?curid=312153" title="2004 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 2004 Canadian federal election was held on June 28, 2004, to elect members to the House of Commons of Canada of the 38th Parliament of Canada. The Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin lost its majority but was able to continue in office as a minority government after the election. This was the first election contested by the newly amalgamated Conservative Party of Canada, after it was formed by the two right-of-centre parties, the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance.

On May 23, 2004, the governor general, Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of Martin, ordered the dissolution of the House of Commons, triggering an early election despite the Liberals being only three and a half years into their five-year mandate. Earlier, the election result was widely expected to be a fourth consecutive majority government for the Liberals, but early in 2004 Liberal popularity fell sharply due to the emerging details of the sponsorship scandal. Polls even started to indicate the possibility of a Conservative minority government. In the end, the Liberals won a minority government, though they were well short of a majority and lost nearly three dozen seats.

On election day, polling times were arranged to allow results from most provinces to be announced more or less simultaneously, with the exception of Atlantic Canada, whose results were known before the close of polling in other provinces due to the British Columbia Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;R v Bryan&quot;.

== Major political parties ==
=== Liberal Party of Canada ===

Until the sponsorship scandal, most pundits were predicting that new Prime Minister Paul Martin would lead the Liberal Party of Canada to a fourth majority government, possibly setting a record for number of seats won.

However, polls released immediately after the scandal broke showed Liberal support down as much as 10% nationwide, with greater declines in its heartland of Quebec and Ontario. Although there was some recovery in Ontario and Atlantic Canada, Liberal hopes of making unprecedented gains in the west faded. The unpopularity of some provincial Liberal parties may also have had an effect on federal Liberal fortunes. In Ontario, for instance, the provincial Liberal government introduced an unpopular budget the week of the expected election call, and their federal counterparts then fell into a statistical dead heat with the Conservatives in polls there. The Liberals were also harmed by high-profile party infighting that had been plaguing the party since Martin&#x27;s earlier ejection from Cabinet by now-former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

===Conservative Party of Canada===

In the final months of 2003, the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance were running a distant third and fourth, respectively, in public opinion polls.

Many pundits predicted that the combination of the popular and fiscally conservative Martin, along with continued vote-splitting on the right, could have led to the almost total annihilation of the Progressive Conservatives and Canadian Alliance. This fear prompted those two parties to form a united Conservative Party of Canada, which was approved by the members of the Canadian Alliance on December 5, 2003, and controversially by the delegates of the Progressive Conservatives on December 6, 2003.

The new Conservative Party pulled well ahead of the NDP in the polls just before the election, although its support remained below the combined support that the Progressive Conservatives and the Alliance had as separate parties. On March 20, the Conservatives elected Stephen Harper as their new leader.

The Conservatives gained more ground in polls after Harper became leader, and the poll results in the weeks before the election had them within one to two points of the Liberals, sometimes ahead, sometimes behind them. Party supporters hoped that the voters would react negatively to the Liberal attacks on what they called Harper&#x27;s &quot;hidden agenda&quot;, and that anger over the sponsorship scandal and other Liberal failures would translate to success at the polls.

Late in the campaign, the Conservatives began to lose some momentum, in part due to remarks made by MPs. Scott Reid, the party&#x27;s language critic, said that the policy of official bilingualism was unrealistic and needed to be reformed. Rob Merrifield, health critic, suggested that women ought to have mandatory family counseling before they choose to have an abortion. Randy White was quoted as saying &quot;to heck with the courts&quot; in reference to &quot;Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage&quot;, suggesting the party would overturn same-sex marriage. Cheryl Gallant drew controversy when she compared abortion to the beheading of Iraq War hostage Nick Berg, and called for the repeal of recently amended hate laws that include sexual orientation as one of the protected groups. Additionally, the Liberal Party began airing controversial TV ads. Harper was also criticized for his position supporting the American-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. The term &quot;hidden agenda&quot;, used commonly in the 2000 election to refer to Stockwell Day, began surfacing with increasing regularity with regard to Harper&#x27;s history of supporting privatized health care. Further damaging the Conservative campaign was a press release from Conservative headquarters that suggested that Paul Martin supported child pornography.

Although on the eve of the election the party was polling slightly ahead of the Liberals everywhere west of Quebec, it had dropped in support, polling behind or on par with Liberals everywhere except the West (Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), where it held onto its traditional support.

All together the new Conservatives fell from the combined Canadian Alliance-Progressive Conservative vote in 2000 of 37%, to only 29% of the vote, yet still gained 21 extra seats, finishing in second-place with 99 seats.

=== New Democratic Party ===

Before the announcement of the merger of the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative Party, some were predicting that the NDP would form the official opposition because the party was polling ahead of both right-of-centre parties. A new leader (Jack Layton) and clear social democratic policies helped revitalize the NDP. Polls suggested that the NDP had returned to the 18% to 20% level of support it enjoyed in the 1984 election and 1988 election. Layton suggested that the NDP would break their previous record of 43 seats won under former leader Ed Broadbent.

The NDP focused the campaign on winning ridings in Canada&#x27;s urban centres, hoping especially to win seats in central Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa and Winnipeg. The party&#x27;s platform was built to cater to these regions and much of Layton&#x27;s time was spent in these areas.

The campaign stumbled early when Layton blamed the deaths of homeless people on Paul Martin, prompting the Liberals to accuse the NDP of negative campaigning. The NDP benefited from the decline in Liberal support, but not to the same extent as the Conservatives. There was an increasing prospect that NDP voters would switch to the Liberals to block a Conservative government. This concern did not manifest itself in the polls, however, and the NDP remained at somewhat below 20 percent mark in the polls for most of the campaign.

The NDP achieved 15% of the popular vote, its highest in 16 years. However, it only won 19 seats in the House of Commons, two less than the 21 won in 1997, and far short of the 40 predicted. There was criticism that Layton&#x27;s focus on urban issues and gay rights marginalized the party&#x27;s traditional emphasis on the poor, the working class, and rural Canadians. Long-time MP Lorne Nystrom and several other incumbents from the Prairie provinces were defeated, with the NDP being shut out of Saskatchewan for the first time since 1965. Layton won his own seat in a tight race, while Broadbent was returned to Parliament after many years of absence.

=== Bloc Québécois ===
The Bloc Québécois (BQ) had managed their best showing back in 1993, but they lost seats to the Liberals in 1997 and 2000, prompting pundits to suggest a decline in support for Quebec sovereignty. The Bloc continued to slide in the polls in most of 2003 after the election of the federalist Quebec Liberal Party at the National Assembly of Quebec under Jean Charest, and during the long run-up to Paul Martin becoming leader of the federal Liberals.

However, things progressively changed during 2003, partly because of the decline in popularity of the Liberal Party of Quebec government of Jean Charest, and partly because support for independence in Quebec rose again (49% in March). The tide took its sharp turn when, in February 2004, the sponsorship scandal (uncovered in considerable part by the Bloc) hit the Liberal federal government.

These events led to a resurgence of the BQ, putting it ahead of the pack once again: according to an Ipsos-Reid poll carried out for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and CTV between the June 4 and 8, 50% of Quebecers intended to vote for the BQ against 24% for the Liberals.
Speculation was ongoing about the possibility of the Bloc forming alliances with other opposition parties or with an eventual minority government to promote its goals of social democracy and respect of the autonomy of provinces. Leader Gilles Duceppe stated that the Bloc, as before, would co-operate with other opposition parties or with the government when interests were found to be in common, but that the Bloc would not participate in a coalition government.

=== Green Party of Canada ===
The Greens ran candidates in all 308 ridings for the first time in its history. The party won twice as many votes in this election than it had over the previous 21 years of its history combined, although it failed to win a seat. It also spent more money than in the previous 21 years, and although much of this money was borrowed, the Greens&#x27; share of the popular vote enabled them to receive federal funding.

== Issues ==
Important issues in the election:
*Sponsorship scandal: badly hurt the Liberals in the polls and the theme of widespread corruption was used by all opposition parties, especially the Bloc.
*Health care: all parties support Canada&#x27;s government-administered health care system but acknowledge that improvements must be made to meet new demographic challenges and to reduce long wait times. Transfer payments to the provinces have been cut substantially to 16% by the federal Liberal government and it was difficult for Paul Martin to reconcile these cuts with his plan to improve the system.
*Fiscal imbalance: all major parties except the Liberals claimed that there was a monetary imbalance between Ottawa and the provinces and spoke of plans to reduce it, the Bloc Québécois probably being the strongest denouncer of the situation.
*Taxation: for the Conservatives, significantly lowering taxes, to stimulate the economy, was a central issue. The Conservatives also promised to end &quot;corporate welfare&quot; and replace it with tax cuts for all businesses. The Liberals, Communist Party and NDP opposed large tax cuts and argued that money should instead be spent to improve social programs.
*Child care: The Liberals and NDP promised national child care programs.
*Parliamentary reform: The Conservatives accused the Liberals of perpetuating &quot;undemocratic practices&quot; in Parliament, by limiting the powers of MPs. Martin called for some reform, but not to the satisfaction of the Conservatives. The Conservatives promised an elected Senate and standing committee and provincial review of judicial appointments. The NDP spoke of abolishing the Senate.
*Electoral reform: Conservatives promised fixed election dates. The NDP promoted the idea of proportional representation voting.
*Same-sex marriage: The Bloc Québécois and the NDP strongly favoured same sex marriage. The NDP considers it a human rights issue, and requires its MPs to either support legislation favouring same-sex marriage or abstain on such questions. The Bloc, on the other hand, treats it as a matter of conscience, allowing its members free votes on the issue. The Liberals sent the issue to be ruled upon by the Supreme Court, and the Liberal caucus was publicly divided on the issue. The majority of Conservative candidates opposed it; the Conservative party&#x27;s official stance was for the issue to be resolved by a free vote in the Commons.
*National Missile Defence: the Bush administration in the U.S. wanted Canada to join the missile shield. The Conservatives strongly supported such a plan while the Bloc and the NDP opposed it. Although the Liberals reiterated past opposition to the weaponization of space, they did not have an expressed opinion on the shield.
*2003 invasion of Iraq: the Conservatives supported the United States over Iraq, while the other parties generally opposed it.
*Gun registry: The Conservatives strongly opposed the gun registry while the other parties support it.
*Marijuana: The Liberals have introduced measures to decriminalize possession of small quantities of marijuana, a move generally supported by the other opposition parties. The Conservative Party opposes such legislation. The Bloc Québécois is more explicit in its support for decriminalization, while the NDP wishes to study the issue and consider going beyond mere decriminalization.
*Abortion: This was not a significant issue in this election. Abortion is legal in Canada after Parliament&#x27;s failure to pass legislation to replace previous restrictions ruled illegal by the courts. Many Conservatives and a few Liberals oppose abortion. The Liberals tried to use it as a wedge issue after comments from pro-life Conservatives, but it did not change the outcome.
*Ontario budget: The introduction by the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty of &quot;Ontario Health Premiums&quot; was very unpopular, despite Mr. McGuinty&#x27;s claim that this new tax was necessary because of the budgetary deficit left by the previous Progressive Conservative government. The Conservatives and the NDP capitalized on this and other unpopular fiscal and tax-related policy to attack the Liberals at the federal level.

== Opinion polls ==

== Results ==

In 2004, a federal party required 155 of the 308 seats to form a majority government in Canada. The Liberals came short of this number, winning 135. Until extremely close ridings were decided on the west coast, it appeared as though the Liberals&#x27; seat total, if combined with that of the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP), would be sufficient to hold a majority in the House of Commons. In the end, the Conservatives won Vancouver Island North, West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, and New Westminster-Coquitlam, after trailing in all three ridings, as preliminary results were announced through the evening.

As a result, the combined seat count of the Liberals and the NDP was 154, while the other 154 seats belonged to the Conservatives, Bloquistes, and one independent Chuck Cadman (previously a Conservative). Rather than forming a coalition with the NDP, the Liberal party led a minority government, obtaining majorities for its legislation on an ad hoc basis. Nevertheless, as the showdown on Bill C-48, a matter of confidence, loomed in the spring of 2005, the Liberals and NDP, who wanted to continue the Parliament, found themselves matched against the Conservatives and the Bloc, who were registering no confidence. The bill passed with the Speaker casting the decisive tie-breaking vote.

Voter turnout nationwide was 60.9%, the lowest in Canadian history at that time, with 13,683,570 out of 22,466,621 registered voters casting their ballots. The voter turnout fell by more than 3pp from the 2000 federal election which had 64.1% turnout.

== Allegations of coalition talks ==
On March 26, 2011, Gilles Duceppe stated that Harper had tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc and NDP two months after the 2004 election. He was responding to Harper&#x27;s warnings in 2011 that the Liberals might form a coalition with the Bloc and the NDP.

<text>Hands Across America was a public fundraising event held on Sunday, May 25, 1986, Memorial Day weekend, which attempted to create a continuous human chain of people holding hands across the contiguous United States. While approximately 5.5 million people participated, the chain was broken in many places, particularly in the Southwestern desert. The number of participants would have been roughly sufficient to create an unbroken chain if they had been spread out evenly along the planned route, but most joined the chain in major cities and few traveled to more remote areas. The various gaps in the line between participants were filled using ribbons, ropes, or banners.

Participants were encouraged to donate $10 to be assigned a place in the line. The proceeds were donated to local charities to fight hunger and homelessness and help those in poverty. The event raised about $15 million for charities after operating costs, significantly less than organizers had hoped to collect.

== Event ==
===Conception and promotion===
The event was promoted and organized by Ken Kragen, a co-founder of USA for Africa, the charity organization which produced &quot;We Are the World&quot; in early 1985 to raise money to fight famine in Africa. Kragen described Hands Across America as &quot;a logical extension&quot; of the &quot;We Are the World&quot; effort, focusing on the issue of hunger in the United States. Kragen said the idea was first suggested to him by advertising executive Geoff Nightingale at a New York City Ballet performance of &quot;We Are the World&quot;. Hands Across America was first publicly announced at a Manhattan press conference on October 22, 1985, featuring Kragen and videotaped messages from Bill Cosby, Kenny Rogers, and Pete Rose. At that time, it was stated that planning for the event had been underway for five months. Coca-Cola agreed to sponsor the event, covering an estimated $18.8 million in operating costs. More than 700 other companies, including CITIBank, McDonalds, Ticketmaster, and Safeway, sponsored and marketed the event.

Hands Across America was unrelated to a previous, unsuccessful project of the same name which attempted to organize a human chain across the country to mark the Bicentennial on July 4, 1976. The 1976 plan was unable to raise enough funds and succeeded only in setting up approximately 8 to 10 miles of chains in and around Chicago. USA for Africa organizers said that they had never heard of the earlier effort until after announcing their plan. Marvin J. Rosenblum, who had conceived of the idea in 1975 and spent a year trying to bring it to fruition, said he found it &quot;hard to believe&quot; that no one in the organization remembered his heavily promoted campaign. However, he was unable to take legal action because his trademark on the name &quot;Hands Across America&quot; had since expired.

A theme song entitled &quot;Hands Across America&quot; was written for the event and was unveiled at a West Hollywood press conference on January 16, 1986. The song was written by Marc Blatte, John Carney, and Larry Gottlieb, and featured lead vocals by session singers Joe Cerisano and Sandy Farina, and the band Toto. On January 18, dozens of celebrities joined hands with hundreds of locals on the main street of Taft, California to film a music video for the song, which was set to first air during the Super Bowl XX halftime show the following week. However, Michael Jackson intervened at a USA for Africa board meeting days before the Super Bowl to insist that &quot;We Are the World&quot; should be played during the broadcast instead. As a result, while portions of the Taft video were seen during the halftime show, the &quot;Hands Across America&quot; song was not heard. The song was distributed to approximately 8,000 radio stations for a nationwide simulcast on the morning of Good Friday, as had been done with &quot;We Are the World&quot; on Good Friday 1985. &quot;Hands Across America&quot; ultimately peaked at #65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Individual participants in Hands Across America were asked to donate $10 for the opportunity to join the chain, although many people who had not paid joined the line anyway. Celebrities and companies could sponsor portions of the line at a cost of $13,200 per mile, since it was estimated that 1,320 people would be needed to cover a mile of the route. Recording artist Prince was reportedly the first person to &quot;buy a mile&quot; in this way.

===Organization===
While celebrities and corporate sponsorships publicized Hands Across America, the task of planning for a transcontinental chain of people fell mostly to political organizers. Fred Droz, a former Democratic Party &quot;advance man&quot; who had become disillusioned with politics after the defeat of Jimmy Carter, became the project&#x27;s national director. Donna Brazile, future chair of the Democratic National Committee, was the director of Hands Across America in Washington, D.C. Kragen compared the structure of the organization to &quot;pyramid selling&quot;, with organizers at the state, regional, and local levels responsible for smaller and smaller segments of the chain, then &quot;mile captains&quot; overseeing each mile and &quot;tenth-of-a-mile captains&quot; at the lowest level.

Particularly in rural and remote areas, organizing the chain required significant logistical efforts. People in cities not along the route were encouraged to apply for an assignment to a place in line, typically a small town a several-hour drive away. An optimal assignment of people to segments of the line was computed by Figi&#x27;s, a subsidiary of mail-order house Fingerhut in Marshfield, Wisconsin, straining the capabilities of computer technology of the time: Figi&#x27;s replaced a previous contractor that had been unable to keep up with the volume of applications. These route assignments were then mailed to applicants, along with a packet of instructions on how to get there and where to park, about a week before the event. A less sophisticated alternative was offered by Ticketmaster, which directed callers on its toll-free numbers to spots on the line immediately upon calling.

Bus rides were organized to transport large groups of people to distant spots along the route. Local organizers and communities the chain passed through, many of which had never hosted thousands of out-of-town visitors before, were responsible for providing food and portable toilets for visitors. No major incidents or injuries were reported during the event, and no claims were filed against Hands Across America&#x27;s insurance policy.

===The day of===
In the days leading up to the event, organizers announced that those who had not donated would not be turned away from joining hands, in the hopes of encouraging more participation and creating a more complete chain of people.

Participants were encouraged to bring portable radios and boomboxes so they could listen to a nationwide simulcast of the event, which was broadcast on thousands of radio stations across the country. Leading up to the event, the radio broadcast played &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, and &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot;. At 3:00 p.m. EDT, 2:00 p.m. CDT, 1:00 p.m. MDT, and 12:00 p.m. PDT, Ken Kragen spoke from New York, instructing participants to join hands. Those in the chain then sang along to &quot;We Are the World&quot;, the &quot;Hands Across America&quot; song, and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; – the lyrics to these three songs were published in many newspapers on the day of the event. The event concluded after 15 minutes.

== Route ==

The eastern end of the chain was at Battery Park in New York City, within view of the Statue of Liberty. The first person in the line was 6-year-old Amy Sherwood, whose family had been living in a local welfare hotel until recently. Notable participants in Battery Park included New York governor Mario Cuomo, mayor Ed Koch, Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor, Senator Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, Yoko Ono and her son Sean Lennon, Harry Belafonte, Helen Hayes, Lily Tomlin, Bella Abzug, Kool and the Gang, Bianca Jagger, Edward James Olmos, Ken Kragen, and Liza Minnelli. Over 200,000 people joined the line in New York City, five times more than were needed to cover the 12-mile stretch across most of Manhattan, including Glenn Close, William Hurt, and Sam Waterston. On the George Washington Bridge, Brooke Shields and Christy Fichtner (who had been selected as Miss USA five days earlier) stood at the sign marking the border between New York and New Jersey.

The date and time chosen for the event inadvertently conflicted with another charity fundraiser, Sport Aid, a global event organized by USA for Africa on the same day. Since Hands Across America was much better publicized in the United States, only 4,000 runners participated the New York City portion for Sport Aid, which coincided with a special session on world hunger at the United Nations.

In New Jersey, the route passed through Newark, New Brunswick, Princeton, and Trenton. At Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor&#x27;s mansion in Princeton, Governor Thomas Kean was joined by Senator Frank Lautenberg and Joan Rivers.

In Philadelphia, the line looped around the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Grover Washington, Jr. stood in Fairmount Park, while Pennsylvania governor Dick Thornburgh and several members of the Philadelphia Eagles participated in front of Independence Hall. Joe Frazier Jr. joined in front of his father&#x27;s gym on Broad Street.

Due to a high level of interest in South Jersey, a spur was added to the route, crossing the Benjamin Franklin Bridge from Philadelphia into Camden, New Jersey and extending southeast as far as Haddonfield before looping back into Pennsylvania. Dionne Warwick joined the line on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, while Tony Danza and Lainie Kazan participated in Camden.

At Delaware Park near Wilmington, horse racing was suspended for 15 minutes so that the line could cross through the racetrack. Pedestrians were not permitted to stand on the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge between Perryville and Havre de Grace, Maryland, so a group of scuba divers connected the line underneath the surface of the Susquehanna River. In Baltimore, the line passed by the Inner Harbor and Pratt Street Power Plant.

In Washington, D.C., the route passed by the United States Capitol, where Rev. Billy Graham spoke; the White House, where President Ronald Reagan and his family participated; and the Lincoln Memorial, where Coretta Scott King and her children Martin and Bernice joined the line. Reagan had previously said he would not join the chain. However, in the days leading up to the event, the president made a controversial remark that &quot;where there is hunger ... you have to determine that that is probably because of a lack of knowledge on the part of the people as to what things are available&quot;. Shortly after his comments were criticized in the press, Reagan announced that he and his family had decided at the last minute to join Hands Across America, although press secretary Larry Speakes denied that there was any connection between the two events. White House staff, Secret Service agents, and members of the press connected the chain through the secured North Lawn of the executive mansion. Reagan&#x27;s participation was itself criticized by activists, who said that the president&#x27;s cuts to social programs had dramatically worsened hunger in America. Mitch Snyder led a chain of his own on the opposite side of Lafayette Square in protest, with activists chanting at the president, &quot;What about tomorrow? What about tonight?&quot; Rev. Jesse Jackson stated, &quot;He should not be in the line. His policies created the line.&quot;

The easternmost reported gaps in the chain were in western Maryland. A seven-mile segment along Route 355 southeast of Frederick was canceled entirely because it was considered too dangerous, and further breaks were observed in Hagerstown. The Maryland state director of Hands Across America said that 90 percent of the route through the state was covered.

The line was initially intended to pass through the playing field of Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, which would have interrupted a baseball game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cincinnati Reds (whose player-manager, Pete Rose, was a co-chairman of Hands Across America). After the Pirates backed out of that plan, a compromise was reached. Instead, a chain across the field was staged before the game began, and at 3 p.m., a group of 150 Little League players brought the official line into the stadium seats and along the dugout roof. While the official route lined up dozens of steelworkers along the Sixth Street Bridge, locals organized &quot;Boats Across the Allegheny&quot;, with dozens of watercraft lined up side-by-side connecting Fort Duquesne Boulevard to Three Rivers Stadium.

The greatest number of participants in the chain of any state were in Ohio, where the route zig-zagged from Youngstown through Akron and Cleveland to Toledo, then returned eastward to Columbus before proceeding southwest to Dayton and Cincinnati. The Ohio Department of Highway Safety took an active role in coordinating its segment of the route and ensuring the safety of participants. The line was originally planned to pass through Port Clinton, but had to be diverted through Fremont after the Thomas A. Edison Memorial Bridge was declared unsuitable for pedestrians. Notable participants in the state included Celeste Holm and Dr. Benjamin Spock in Cleveland, Don Novello in Lorain, Ohio governor Richard Celeste and senator John Glenn in Columbus, and David Copperfield in Cincinnati. At SeaWorld Ohio in Aurora, two orcas and their trainers, along with a sea lion and a baby Magellanic penguin, took part.

The event fell on the same day as the Indianapolis 500, leading to concerns about the logistics of bringing the route through Indianapolis. Avoiding any problems near the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the route passed through only the northeastern corner of the city near Lawrence. The Indy 500 was rained out and postponed until the following weekend, while the weather also caused lower turnout than expected for the city&#x27;s segment of Hands Across America. A widely reported human-interest story was that of the small town of Denver, Indiana, where thousands of residents of the larger city of Fort Wayne were expected to join the line, and the route was extended through Denver to accommodate them. However, turnout there also fell well below expectations and the original route bypassing Denver was used instead. Both the weather and the continuity of the line were better in northern Indiana, where the route crossed through South Bend, Michigan City, and Gary.

In Chicago, Illinois, the route ran up King Drive and Michigan Avenue to the Oak Street Beach and Lincoln Park, proceeding from there to the western and southwestern suburbs. Notable participants in the city included Oprah Winfrey at Cermak Road, mayor Harold Washington on a stretch of Michigan Avenue lined with over 1,000 city employees, Illinois governor James R. Thompson and Super Bowl XX champion quarterback Jim McMahon on the Magnificent Mile, Senator Alan J. Dixon in Lincoln Park, and Cardinal Joseph Bernardin in Orland Park.

The route through central Illinois passed through Champaign, Decatur, and the state capitol of Springfield. The Illinois Department of Transportation forbade pedestrians from standing in intersections during the event, so duct tape was laid down along crosswalks and participants held either end of the tape. The small town of Onarga rejected event organizers, and participants who were supposed to be bussed there were redirected to other areas. In Champaign, where the 1985 Chicago Bears had trained for their successful Super Bowl run four months earlier, Walter Payton sponsored a mile of the line, but was unable to attend due to the team&#x27;s spring practice in Platteville, Wisconsin.

The line crossed the Clark Bridge over the Mississippi River from Alton, Illinois to St. Louis, Missouri, where Illinois senator Paul Simon and Missouri state legislator Mary Kasten joined hands at the state line. In St. Louis, the line passed underneath the Gateway Arch, where actors Kathleen Turner and Eric Douglas joined mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl. A segment near the village of Old Appleton, Missouri, led by activist Wayne Cryts and sponsored by Monsanto, was designated the &quot;American Family Farmer Mile&quot;, and 29,000 pounds of food (purchased with grant money raised from Farm Aid) was distributed to struggling farmers who joined the line there.

At Cape Girardeau, the route crossed the Mississippi again, then roughly followed the river&#x27;s east bank through southern Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Kentucky&#x27;s segment included &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; stars Christopher Durham and Malcolm Groome in Bardwell and Clinton, respectively, and Mel McDaniel and Peter Fonda at the Tennessee state line in Fulton. The official midpoint of the line was in Ripley, Tennessee, where 14,000 people gathered along a three-mile stretch of U.S. Route 51 alongside Judy Collins, Brenda Lee, the Marshall Tucker Band, Lynn Anderson, Terri Gibbs, and &quot;General Hospital&quot;&#x27;s André Landzaat.

In Memphis, the line passed down historic Beale Street, where people grabbed the hands and ankles of the Elvis Presley statue to include him in the chain. Ruby Wilson joined in front of the W. C. Handy statue nearby. Other notable participants in the city included Mel Tillis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins.

In and around St. Francis County, Arkansas, one of the poorest regions in the country, the chain was unbroken between West Memphis and Forrest City, but some of the largest gaps in the state appeared west of Forrest City. At the state capitol in Little Rock, governor and future president Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary Clinton and their daughter Chelsea joined the chain. The line also passed through the wards of Arkansas Children&#x27;s Hospital.

The longest segment of the route was in Texas, stretching over 600 miles from Texarkana to Glenrio. East of Dallas, disabled members of Paraplegics on Independent Nature Trips formed a line of kayaks across Lake Ray Hubbard, although they were unable to create an unbroken chain across the lake. The event was undeterred by a storm the previous day which left parts of North Texas flooded. Participants in Dallas included Mickey Leland, Tony Bennett, and Tony Dorsett. Along US Highway 287, which the route followed for a remote stretch of hundreds of miles that passed through Wichita Falls and Amarillo, the roadway was dotted with clusters of people at every mile marker connected by ropes. The Forester Sisters performed on the line in Amarillo.

Kenny Rogers and Lee Greenwood stood on the back of a flatbed truck straddling the border between Texas and New Mexico in the ghost town of Glenrio. Rogers had been featured in television commercials for Hands Across America, telling viewers &quot;Don&#x27;t leave me alone out there.&quot; Thousands of people gathered in and around Glenrio, and the band Renegade performed for the crowd there.

Lance Guest and Michael Ironside stood in Santa Rosa, New Mexico. Governor Toney Anaya returned to his hometown of Moriarty to participate, along with former governor Bruce King and his family, who lived nearby in Stanley, Robert Prosky, Michael Madsen, Billy Zane, and Tom O&#x27;Brien. At Albuquerque&#x27;s train station, where a transcontinental Amtrak train happened to stop at the appointed time, conductors and passengers joined hands at the depot. West of Albuquerque, a &quot;bikers&#x27; mile&quot; featured Mickey Jones. Alex English and Holly Palance participated in Grants. At Red Rock State Park in Gallup, the event coincided with a weekend powwow, and a crowd of over 2,000, predominantly Native Americans, took part. Don Johnson and Rev. Jesse Jackson were expected to attend in Gallup, but neither did. A traditional dance contest at the powwow offered $80,000 in prizes, but only came up with $10,000; the national Hands Across America organization denied that it had promised to fund the contest. New Mexico saw a larger proportion of its population turn out than any other state along the route, although this still represented less than half of the people needed to complete the chain through the state.

In Navajo, Arizona, a segment designated as one of the event&#x27;s &quot;toughest miles&quot; to fill was sponsored by American Express, and over 1,000 American Express employees and family members joined hands with local members of the Navajo Nation, Ray Parker, Jr., Hervé Villechaize, and Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt to ensure the mile was unbroken. Along Interstate 40 between Winslow and Flagstaff, B.J. Thomas appeared with Hopis, Navajos, and a group of indigenous Bolivians who had traveled to the United States for the event. Ed Begley, Jr. and Thelma Houston stood at Sunset Point near Black Canyon City, north of Phoenix.

The largest gaps appeared in Arizona, where the line crossed through hundreds of miles of desert. Two months before the event, a widely quoted &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; editorial by Holly Remy questioned the idea of the event: &quot;Ken Kragen has got to be kidding. [...] Now, it doesn&#x27;t take a heap of gray matter to know what Phoenix is like at the end of May. It is like the inside of a pizza oven. It is so hot that snakes stick to the ground. It is certainly too hot to hold hands.&quot; As is typical for Memorial Day weekend in Arizona, temperatures were over 90 degrees on the day of the event. Organizers canceled the portion of the route from Tonopah to Ehrenberg, on the border with California, due to concerns about extreme heat. To symbolically complete the connection, helicopters took off from both towns at the appointed time and met in Vicksburg, where a time capsule was buried in a ceremony headlined by Robert Goulet.

In Blythe, California, an estimated 10,000 people gathered from the Arizona state border to downtown, including Senator Alan Cranston, Bo Derek, Shelley Duvall, and Anson Williams. The segment of the route through the Colorado Desert from Blythe to Indio was canceled due to concerns about extreme heat, and a &quot;human energy ribbon&quot; stretched across this 100-mile gap. However, hundreds of people still turned out in 100-degree heat in Desert Center, near the middle of the canceled stretch, joined by the band REO Speedwagon. Scattered chains of people participated throughout the Coachella Valley in Indio, Palm Desert, and Palm Springs, where temperatures reached as high as 104 degrees on the day of the event. Gerald Ford and Frank Sinatra were among them in Rancho Mirage.

Bob Seger and Charlene Tilton joined the chain in Riverside. Inside the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, televangelist Rev. Robert Schuller led 3,000 parishioners in joining hands, including Pat Boone and state attorney general John Van de Kamp. In Anaheim, Disneyland allowed the line to enter its gates, where park employees and their family members joined hands with costumed characters and Walt Disney Company president Frank Wells.

Cesar Chavez stood in East Los Angeles. A chain made up largely of homeless people ran past the shelters and soup kitchens of Skid Row. At City Hall, mayor Tom Bradley was joined by Drew Barrymore and Leslie Uggams. A loop traversed the Santa Monica Mountains into the San Fernando Valley; a mile there near the Sportsmen&#x27;s Lodge was sponsored by Steven Spielberg, who was joined by Stacy Keach, Tracy Nelson, LeVar Burton, Richard Dreyfuss, and costumed Warner Bros. cartoon characters. Gregory Peck and Sidney Poitier were in Beverly Hills, while Dyan Cannon, Tom Hayden, and Jeff Bridges stood in Santa Monica.

The western end of the route was in Long Beach, at the mooring site of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Celebrities in Long Beach included Lyle Alzado, Shari Belafonte, Whoopi Goldberg, Dudley Moore, Donny Osmond, Daniel J. Travanti, Cicely Tyson, Ben Vereen, Raquel Welch, Donna Mills, and Kenny Loggins. Beach Boys tribute band Papa Doo Run Run performed at the Long Beach celebration, joined by Alzado, Loggins, and emerging actor John Stamos. At the end of the line were Bill Jones, Mary Hally, and their five children, residents of a local homeless shelter.

===Number of participants===
The following table compares the estimates made by Hands Across America organizers of the number of people needed ahead of the event and of the number of people who actually participated. The total number of participants came close to the estimated total that would have been needed for a single unbroken chain across the country, with estimates of both ranging from 5.4 to 5.7 million. However, many of these participants were in crowds in major cities, where there were often multiple parallel chains, while more remote areas had few or no people present.

==Related events==
Numerous other human chains were staged across the country at the same time as Hands Across America, most of them raising money for local charities or for the official Hands Across America fund. Organizers estimated that approximately 1.5 million people joined one of these chains. A prominent example was &quot;Hands Across Massachusetts&quot;, a four-mile loop through Boston and Cambridge, which was reportedly the only such event to receive the official endorsement of the national Hands Across America organization. Senator Ted Kennedy spoke at the event, where he criticized President Reagan&#x27;s approach toward the issue of hunger. Kennedy also expressed his wish that more Northern states could have been included as New England is one of the most densely populated places in America. A counterevent had also been staged in Honolulu, where Senator Daniel Inouye and actor Tom Selleck participated in a &quot;Hands Across Oahu&quot; event, where participants remarked &quot;Hawaiians are Americans, too&quot;.

The day before the official event, a chain stretching the length of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California was staged, featuring mayoral candidate John Molinari and future mayor Willie Brown. Another unofficial but widely reported event took place at Rahway State Prison in New Jersey, where approximately 500 inmates staged &quot;Hands Across the Big Yard&quot; and raised money for Hands Across America amongst themselves. After a Hands Across America organizer presented a video about the event to the prisoners, a group of inmates offered to fill gaps in the Southwest. When that idea was rejected, the inmates staged their own chain inside the prison.

== Legacy ==
Organizers had hoped that Hands Across America would raise between $50 million and $100 million, making it one of the largest charity fundraisers in history. Ahead of the event, Ken Kragen downplayed these expectations, saying &quot;Ten million is a success. Twenty million is an extreme success. Fifty million would basically parallel or outdo &#x27;We Are the World&#x27;.&quot; The total amount of donations was estimated at $36.4 million, with $27.8 million coming from individuals and another $8.6 million donated by corporations. After covering operating costs, this left approximately $15 million to be distributed to charities. The process of paying the organization&#x27;s bills and choosing recipient charities took months, and by the end of 1986, no funds had been distributed, drawing criticism from charity groups. The first batch of grants was given out in January 1987, and the last of the remaining money was distributed in November of that year. In selecting charities to receive the money, USA for Africa generally preferred those seeking to produce long-term changes rather than those aiming to provide immediate relief.

Hands Across America was among the last of a series of widely publicized, celebrity-sponsored charity events in the mid-1980s, following Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot;, Live Aid, Farm Aid, and Comic Relief USA. By the time Hands Across America was staged, many Americans were growing skeptical of the effectiveness and purpose of these events, and organizers of such events grew concerned that their appeals could have diminishing returns. Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof announced in October 1985 that he would step back from charity work, saying that &quot;compassion fatigue has very much set in&quot;. Geldof&#x27;s comment and the term &quot;compassion fatigue&quot; were frequently used by media outlets in questioning whether Hands Across America&#x27;s efforts to raise awareness would have any long-term impact. Peter Hansen of UNICEF warned that &quot;we&#x27;re quickly going to reach the saturation point&quot;. A scathing article about Hands Across America and similar events in &quot;The New Republic&quot; went further, arguing that this wave of celebrity charity events reflected a loss of faith in the ability of politicians and government institutions to solve problems, and was doomed to fail because it could not command the amount of money or long-term focus needed for significant change.

After the runaway success of &quot;We Are the World&quot; and the more modest fundraising of Hands Across America, the USA for Africa Foundation adopted a lower profile, moving out of its offices in Century City and cutting operating costs. Its next fundraising effort, &quot;Brands Across America&quot;, encouraged shoppers to send in proof-of-purchase of food products, in exchange for which the manufacturer would donate a portion of the proceeds to USA for Africa.

Hands Across America has occasionally been featured in popular culture, often as a symbol of nostalgia for the 1980s. In a 1992 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot;, Homer Simpson remembers sitting on the couch while his wife and children, along with the Flanders and Lovejoy families, participate in the event, watching a television which reports that &quot;except for large gaps in the western states, Hands Across America was a complete success&quot;. A human chain reminiscent of Hands Across America features in the music video for Michael Jackson&#x27;s 2001 song &quot;Cry&quot;. A 2016 episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, set in suburban Philadelphia in the 1980s, centers around characters joining the event. In Season 1, Episode 7 of &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;, Dr. Iggy Frome, played by Tyler Labine, likens a chain of liver transplants to &quot;Hands Across America, but with livers.&quot;

Hands Across America has also been used as a satirical symbol, most notably in the 2019 American horror film &quot;Us&quot;, directed by Jordan Peele. Peele was inspired by the &quot;eerie imagery&quot; of Hands Across America commercials, as the initiative struck him to be more &quot;for the people who are holding hands to cure hunger than for the people who are hungry themselves.&quot; In the movie, Hands Across America inspires the Tethered to overthrow their unwitting oppressors and form a human chain of their own.

<text>Pendulum Music (For Microphones, Amplifiers Speakers and Performers) is the name of a work by Steve Reich, involving suspended microphones and speakers, creating phasing feedback tones. The piece was composed in August 1968 and revised in May 1973, and is an example of process music.

==Overview==
Reich came up with the concept while working at the University of Colorado. He was swinging a live microphone in the style of the cowboy&#x27;s lasso, and noting the produced feedback, he composed for an &quot;orchestra&quot; of microphones.

Three or more microphones are suspended above the speakers by means of a cable and stand. The microphones are pulled back, switched on, and released over the speaker, and gravity causes them to swing back and forth as pendula. As the microphone nears the speaker, a feedback tone is created. Different lengths of cable will swing at different speeds, creating an overlapping series of feedback squeals. The music created is thus the result of the &quot;process&quot; of the swinging microphones.

According to Reich, &quot;The piece is ended sometime shortly after all mikes have come to rest and are feeding back a continuous tone by performers pulling the power cords of the amplifiers&quot;. He also added: &quot;If it&#x27;s done right, it&#x27;s kind of funny&quot;.

Reich&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Writings About Music&quot; contains the hand-written (1973 revision) description of how to perform the piece.

&quot;Writings About Music&quot; contains a photo of a performance at the Whitney Museum of American Art on May 27, 1969. The performers there were Richard Serra, James Tenney, Bruce Nauman and Michael Snow.

==Notable recordings==
Experimental rock group Sonic Youth recorded the piece on its 1999 album &quot;SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century&quot;. The Avant-Garde Ensemble recorded three different versions of &quot;Pendulum Music&quot;. In 2014, composer Daniel Fishkin created a new transcription of the piece, in which, instead of using audio feedback, the feedback takes place in the domain of light, using solar cells and oscilloscopes instead of microphones and loudspeakers.

In 2012, Richard D James performed a version of the piece using lasers reflected off of giant Newton&#x27;s cradles.

<doc id="312168" wikidata="Q1388550" url="?curid=312168" title="John Stainer">
<text>Sir John Stainer (6 June 1840 – 31 March 1901) was an English composer and organist whose music, though seldom performed today (with the exception of &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;, still heard at Passiontide in some Anglican churches), was very popular during his lifetime. His work as choir trainer and organist set standards for Anglican church music that are still influential. He was also active as an academic, becoming Heather Professor of Music at Oxford.

Stainer was born in Southwark, London, in 1840, the son of a schoolmaster. He became a chorister at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral when aged ten and was appointed to the position of organist at St Michael&#x27;s College, Tenbury, at the age of sixteen. He later became organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, and subsequently organist at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. When he retired owing to his poor eyesight and deteriorating health, he returned to Oxford to become Professor of Music at the university. He died unexpectedly while on holiday in Italy in 1901.

==Early years==
John Stainer was the eighth of nine children born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where his father joined his brother in his cabinet making business, later becoming a vestry clerk and registrar of births, and a parish schoolmaster. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders. He could play Bach&#x27;s Fugue in E major at the age of seven.

In 1849, after a year&#x27;s probation, young Stainer became a chorister at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He was already an accomplished player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch and a fine treble voice and soon became the choir&#x27;s principal soloist.

In 1854, he was invited to sing in the first English performance of Bach&#x27;s St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9:30 a.m. and 3:15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral&#x27;s present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St Sepulchre&#x27;s Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral under John Goss. At this time he might have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years. Certainly the two young men later became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays.

In 1855, he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet&#x27;s, Paul&#x27;s Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.
At the age of sixteen, Stainer was appointed by Sir Frederick Ouseley to the post of organist at the newly founded St Michael&#x27;s College, Tenbury. Ouseley was Heather Professor of Music at Oxford University and had recently become vicar of St Michael&#x27;s College on the outskirts of Tenbury Wells, a choir school with a church that he had founded and endowed and which was intended to serve as a model for Anglican church music. Although Stainer was not much older than the choristers were, Stainer was put in charge of them. One of his duties was to give piano lessons to the boys for two hours a day.

Ouseley was an antiquarian and had an extensive library. He was much interested in the history of music and acted as Stainer&#x27;s mentor. Under his guidance, Stainer became the youngest ever successful candidate for the Bachelor of Music degree at Oxford. For this, Stainer wrote a cantata, &quot;Praise the Lord, O my soul&quot;, with text from Psalm 103. Its traditional style was designed to appeal to the examining board and sounds stilted when set against his later works. About this time he wrote several anthems, the most successful of which was &quot;I saw the Lord&quot;, a bolder and more original work in a more contemporary idiom.

==Magdalen College==
In 1860 he became organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, initially for a period of six months, at a salary of £120 per year. His duties included playing for services, training the choir and leading them on Fridays, a day on which the organ was not used. A new organ had been installed five years earlier that was ideal for developing his talent. He proved satisfactory in the post, and his contract was made permanent. He was permitted to study for a degree as long as it did not interfere with his duties, and he chose to do so in the expectation that it would raise his social status. He gained his BA in 1864 and his MA two years later and was keen to proceed to his Mus Doc, which would raise his standing within the university.
Unfailingly conscientious as a choirmaster, Stainer introduced new anthems and service music, bringing the choir to a higher level of attainment than it had previously seen. It had been the custom for the adult choir members, the lay clerks, not to attend practice at all; but Stainer had a magnetic personality and persuaded them to come. Their more regular attendance enabled the repertoire to be enlarged. Stainer&#x27;s skill on the organ was much respected, and he was regarded as &quot;the finest organist Oxford had seen in many generations&quot;. The vice chancellor, Francis Jeune, was an admirer and in 1861 appointed Stainer to the prestigious post of University Organist at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin. Here he was expected to play for a service every Sunday (at a later time in the morning than the Magdalen service).

At this time he was composing liturgical music and developing his musical style. There were several anthems and two more technically assured multi-sectioned verse anthems, &quot;Drop down, ye heavens from above&quot; and &quot;They were lovely and pleasant in their lives&quot;. His routine included two services daily, rehearsals, lectures, tutorials, attendance at Ouseley&#x27;s lectures, and visits home to Southwark in the vacations. He must have performed his duties with diligence as his salary was raised by £10 a year and after 1862 he received an allowance towards his rent.

Stainer was also conductor of the Magdalen Madrigal Society, which gave concerts in the College Hall, and the Magdalen Vagabonds, which performed during vacations. The latter gave concerts in various towns and cities and raised money for church restoration. He wrote some madrigals himself, which were published by Novello, a company with which he was to do much future business. He also wrote an oratorio, &quot;Gideon&quot;, as the exercise for his doctorate and it was performed in November 1865. It was well received on the day and was sufficient to gain him his doctorate but has not been performed since.

After Stainer had obtained his doctorate, Ouseley enrolled him as an examiner for Oxford musical degrees. In this capacity Stainer met and later became friends with Hubert Parry. Attending at evensong at Magdalen College in 1866, Parry wrote in his diary &quot;Stainer played the last 3 movements of the Sonata in B-flat (Mendelssohn) afterwards most gloriously&quot;. He examined William Pole and Frederick Bridge and became involved in organ and music tuition and wider musical activities. He had considerable influence on sacred music in Oxford and his reputation spread beyond the confines of the city. He was employed to play solo organ works at weekly concerts at Crystal Palace and took part regularly in the Three Choirs Festival.

Stainer was interested in the history of music and traditional folk songs. He encouraged contralto, composer, and festival organizer Mary Augusta Wakefield, who shared this interest. There was a revived interest in carols at the time, and he rediscovered old carols, provided new settings for others and introduced contemporary works. Many of his harmonisations are still in use today. He published a volume &quot;Christmas Carols New and Old&quot; which was a considerable success, with thousands of copies sold. He followed this up with another edition the following year to which he persuaded Arthur Sullivan to contribute. He also composed several hymn tunes, and some of these are still to be found in Anglican hymnals, with &quot;Love divine, all loves excelling&quot; being popular at wedding services. Other parish music followed with a congregational &quot;Te Deum in C&quot; which was regularly sung at Magdalen on Sundays and a verse anthem &quot;Sing a song of praise&quot;. Two more substantial anthems, intended for use in cathedrals, were &quot;Lead kindly light&quot; composed in 1868, followed by &quot;Awake, awake, put on thy strength&quot; in 1871. He also produced two evening canticles and a comprehensive set of music for morning, communion and evening services. He had also been working for a long time on his first theoretical work, &quot;A Theory of Harmony Founded on the Tempered Scale&quot;, published by Novello in 1871.

==St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral==
In 1871, Goss resigned as organist of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Stainer was appointed to the position early in 1872 at a salary of £400 per annum. By this time he had been married for seven years and had five children with another due shortly. The organ was in the process of being rebuilt, by the organ builder Henry Willis to Stainer&#x27;s design, with portions on either side of the entrance to the choir stalls. Around this time he was asked to help revise &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot;, a task he did with enthusiasm. At St Paul&#x27;s, he soon set about reinvigorating the choir. The appointment of vicars choral was for life, and the tenor and bass voices saw no need for rehearsal, meaning that the repertoire was static. Stainer was able to change their attitude, and new anthems and liturgies were introduced, a choir school built, and the number of choristers increased from twelve to thirty-five. When William Sparrow Simpson was appointed Succentor, the raising of standards continued, and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral became the focus of religious ceremony in the capital, including state occasions, ceremonial events, memorial services and the funerals of the great and famous. A peal of twelve bells was installed in 1878.

Further appointments followed. Stainer became an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1877 and an examiner for the Doctor of Music degree at Cambridge and London Universities. He accepted the post of musical director of the Madrigal Society of London. He was particularly honoured to be asked to be a juror at the French Exhibition in Paris in 1878 and in 1880 was an adjudicator at the Welsh Eisteddfod at Caernarvon. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1879.

In 1882, Stainer was offered the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a position he took with great seriousness and which he occupied for six years. His assistant was William Gray McNaught. Together they worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. Stainer advocated the use of musical notation and tonic sol-fa rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now treated with the greatest respect in musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition. The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio &quot;Mary Magdalen&quot;. This was followed in 1887 by &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;, the work for which he is most remembered.

In 1885, he was awarded an honorary degree by Durham University, and he became Heather Professor at Oxford in 1889 following the death of Ouseley. He conducted pioneering research into early music, notably the output of Netherlandish Renaissance composer Guillaume Du Fay and Gilles Binchois, then scarcely known even among experts. He also contributed a small treatise, &quot;Harmony&quot;, and another, &quot;Composition&quot;, to the famous series of Novello musical primers. For budding organists he wrote a primer called, simply, &quot;The Organ&quot;, which continues to have a following. In recognition of his services to British music, he received a knighthood from Queen Victoria in 1888.

==Retirement==

Following a childhood accident, Stainer had lost the use of one eye. There is some confusion about this and he may merely have had a lazy eye, but for a brief period in 1875 he feared he was losing the sight of the other eye. This proved not to be the case, but he suffered from eye strain and impairment to his vision for much of his life. This was a major reason for his decision to retire from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1888, while still in his forties. As Bumpus was to write, &quot;Such honours as are at the disposal of his fellow musicians have been freely showered upon him, for he is universally beloved and esteemed, but his many onerous duties, his organistship of this, his presidency of that, and his incessant hard work as an examiner, have all involved responsibility and constant application, and the result is that his sight and general health have given way under the severe strain of sheer hard work.&quot;

In later life, he and his wife took to travelling to the Riviera, Florence or Mentone each year for him to relax and recuperate. It was on such a visit to Verona, Italy, that on Palm Sunday, 31 March 1901 he felt unwell and retired to his room. Later that afternoon he died of a heart attack. He was sixty. His body was taken back to England, and his funeral service was held on 6 April at St Cross Church, Oxford with a large number of friends and colleagues present, followed by burial in adjacent Holywell Cemetery.

Lady Stainer was devastated by his death and went into mourning for a year, but as she confided to a friend, the pianist Francesco Berger, &quot;I am thankful he has been spared long illness and the weariness of old age, which he always dreaded&quot;. She gave a memorial stained glass window to St Cross Church and arranged for a monument to be erected at Magdalen College. Her husband&#x27;s valuable library of antiquarian music books passed to his elder son, J F R Stainer, who allowed its use for study and research purposes. The collection was sold to an American collector in 1932 who, on his death in 1973, had it bequeathed to the Bodleian Library, where it remains. Lady Stainer died in 1916 leaving six children. She is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford, beside her husband.

==Legacy==

Stainer&#x27;s output of sacred music was extensive, including the Passion cantata or oratorio &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; (1887), the &quot;Sevenfold Amen&quot; (this latter piece was especially admired by the lexicographer Sir George Grove), and numerous hymn tunes, including &quot;Cross of Jesus&quot;, &quot;All for Jesus&quot; (both from &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;), and &quot;Love Divine&quot;. His settings for the &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Sanctus&quot; were sung at the coronation of Edward VII in 1902.

His work as a composer was much esteemed during his lifetime but is not well known today - and Stainer himself was dismissive of his own work, telling Edmund Fellowes that &quot;he regretted ever having published most of his compositions&quot;. &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; is one of the few major works of his that is still regularly performed. It is often given in Anglican churches during Holy Week and forms part of the repertoire of numerous choirs. He also made a lasting contribution to the music of Christmas in his &quot;Christmas Carols New and Old&quot; (1871), produced in collaboration with the Revd. H. R. Bramley, which marked an important stage in the revival of the Christmas carol. The book includes Stainer&#x27;s arrangements of what were to become the standard versions of &quot;What Child Is This&quot;, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, &quot;The First Nowell&quot;, and &quot;I Saw Three Ships&quot;, among others. He was a skilled musician and accompanist and Walter Galpin Alcock, who was taught composition by Arthur Sullivan at the National Training School of Music, recalls Sullivan saying &quot;I was at St Paul&#x27;s yesterday, listening to Dr Stainer extemporising. My dear young friends, he is a genius, and I hope you will miss no chance of hearing him.&quot; John Stainer was also a close friend of Edmund Hart Turpin, the later Hon. Secr. of the Royal College of Organists for more than fifty years.

<doc id="312170" wikidata="Q338857" url="?curid=312170" title="Minamata disease">
<text>is a neurological disease caused by severe mercury poisoning. Signs and symptoms include ataxia, numbness in the hands and feet, general muscle weakness, loss of peripheral vision, and damage to hearing and speech. In extreme cases, insanity, paralysis, coma, and death follow within weeks of the onset of symptoms. A congenital form of the disease affects fetuses, causing microcephaly, extensive cerebral damage, and symptoms similar to those seen in cerebral palsy. 

Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning. The poisoning and resulting deaths of both humans and animals continued for 36 years, while Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic. The animal effects were severe enough in cats that they came to be named as having &quot;dancing cat fever.&quot;

As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognized as having Minamata disease and over 10,000 had received financial compensation from Chisso. By 2004, Chisso had paid $86 million in compensation, and in the same year was ordered to clean up its contamination. On March 29, 2010, a settlement was reached to compensate as-yet uncertified victims.

A second outbreak of Minamata disease occurred in Niigata Prefecture in 1965. The original Minamata disease and Niigata Minamata disease are considered two of the Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan.

== 1908–1955 ==
In 1908, the Chisso Corporation first opened a chemical factory in Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, located on the west coast of the southern island of Kyūshū. Initially producing fertilisers, the factory followed the nationwide expansion of Japan&#x27;s chemical industry, branching out into production of acetylene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, vinyl chloride, and octanol, among others. The Minamata factory became the most advanced in all of Japan, both before and after World War II. The waste products resulting from the manufacture of these chemicals were released into Minamata Bay through the factory wastewater. These pollutants had a deleterious environmental impact. Fisheries were damaged in terms of reduced catches; in response, Chisso reached two separate compensation agreements with the fishery cooperative in 1926 and 1943.

The rapid expansion of the Chisso factory spurred on the local economy, and as the company prospered so did Minamata. This fact, combined with the lack of other industry, meant that Chisso had great influence in the city. At one point, over half of the tax revenue of Minamata City authority came from Chisso and its employees, and the company and its subsidiaries were responsible for creating a quarter of all jobs in Minamata. The city was even dubbed Chisso&#x27;s &quot;castle town,&quot; in reference to the capital cities of feudal lords who ruled Japan during the Edo period.

The Chisso factory first started acetaldehyde production in 1932, with 210 tons that year. In 1951, production had jumped to 6,000 tons and eventually peaked at 45,245 tons in 1960. The factory&#x27;s output historically amounted to between a quarter and a third of Japan&#x27;s total acetaldehyde production. The chemical reaction used to produce the acetaldehyde employed mercury sulfate as a catalyst. Starting in August 1951, the co-catalyst was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide. A side reaction of this catalytic cycle led to the production of a significant amount (about 5% of the outflow) of the organic mercury compound methylmercury. As a result of the catalyst change, this highly toxic compound was released into Minamata Bay regularly between 1951 and 1968, when this production method was finally discontinued.

== 1956–1959 ==

On 21 April 1956, a five-year-old girl was examined at Chisso&#x27;s factory hospital in Minamata. The physicians were puzzled by her symptoms: difficulty walking, difficulty speaking, and convulsions. Two days later, her younger sister also began to exhibit the same symptoms and she, too, was hospitalised. The girls&#x27; mother informed doctors that her neighbour&#x27;s daughter was also experiencing similar problems. After a house-to-house investigation, eight further patients were discovered and hospitalised. On 1 May, the hospital director reported an &quot;epidemic of an unknown disease of the central nervous system&quot; to the local public health office, marking the official discovery of Minamata disease.

To investigate the epidemic, the city government and various medical practitioners formed the Strange Disease Countermeasures Committee at the end of May 1956. Owing to the localised nature of the disease, it was initially suspected to be contagious; patients were isolated and their homes disinfected as a precaution. Although contagion was later disproved, this initial response contributed to the stigmatisation and discrimination experienced by Minamata survivors from the local community. During its investigations, the Committee uncovered surprising anecdotal evidence of the strange behaviour of cats and other wildlife in the areas surrounding patients&#x27; homes. Reports of cats convulsing, going mad and dying started around 1950. Locals called it the &quot;cat dancing disease&quot; in reference to the cats&#x27; erratic movements. Crows had fallen from the sky, seaweed no longer grew on the sea bed, and fish floated dead on the surface of the sea. As the extent of the outbreak was understood, the committee invited researchers from Kumamoto University (or Kumadai) to help in the research effort.

The Kumamoto University Research Group was formed on 24 August 1956. Researchers from the School of Medicine began visiting Minamata regularly and admitted patients to the university hospital for extensive examination. A more complete picture of the symptoms exhibited by patients was gradually uncovered. The disease struck without any prior warning, with patients complaining of a loss of sensation and numbness in their hands and feet. They became unable to grasp small objects or fasten buttons. They could not run or walk without stumbling, their voices changed in pitch, and many patients complained of difficulties seeing, hearing, and swallowing. In general, these symptoms worsened and were followed by severe convulsions, coma, and eventually death. By October 1956, forty patients had been discovered, fourteen of whom had died - an alarming case fatality rate of 35%.

=== Finding the cause ===

Researchers from Kumadai also began to focus on the cause of the strange disease. They found that the victims, often members of the same family, were clustered in fishing hamlets along the shore of Minamata Bay. The staple food of victims was invariably fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay. The cats in these areas, who often ate scraps from the family table, presented with symptoms similar to humans. This led the researchers to believe that the outbreak was caused by some kind of food poisoning, with contaminated fish and shellfish being the prime suspects.

On 4 November, the research group announced its initial findings: &quot;Minamata disease is rather considered to be poisoning by a heavy metal, presumably it enters the human body mainly through fish and shellfish.&quot;

=== Identification of mercury ===
As soon as the investigation identified a heavy metal as the causal substance, the wastewater from the Chisso factory was immediately suspected as the origin. The company&#x27;s own tests revealed that its wastewater contained many heavy metals in concentrations sufficiently high enough to bring about serious environmental degradation, including lead, mercury, manganese, arsenic, thallium, and copper, plus the chalcogen selenium. Identifying which particular poison was responsible for the disease proved to be extremely difficult and time-consuming. During 1957 and 1958, many different theories were proposed by different researchers. At first, manganese was thought to be the causal substance due to the high concentrations found in fish and the organs of the deceased. Thallium, selenium, and a multiple contaminant theory were also proposed. In March 1958, visiting British neurologist Douglas McAlpine suggested that Minamata symptoms resembled those of organic mercury poisoning, which shifted the focus of the investigation to mercury.

In February 1959, researchers tested the waters of Minamata Bay for mercury. The results were shocking - high quantities of mercury were detected in fish, shellfish, and sludge from the bay. The highest concentrations centred around the Chisso factory wastewater canal in Hyakken Harbour, decreasing as it went out to sea, clearly identifying the plant as the source of contamination. At the mouth of the wastewater canal, a figure of 2 kg of mercury per ton of sediment was measured, a level so high that it would be economically viable to mine (Chisso later set up a subsidiary to reclaim and sell the mercury recovered from the sludge).

Hair samples were taken from the residents of Minamata and tested for mercury. In residents affected by the disease, the highest mercury level recorded was 705 parts per million (ppm), indicating very heavy exposure, and in asymptomatic Minamata residents, the highest level was 191 ppm. This compared to an average level of 4 ppm for people living outside the Minamata area.

On 12 November 1959, the Ministry of Health and Welfare&#x27;s Minamata Food Poisoning Subcommittee published its results:

== 1959 ==

During the Kumadai investigation, the causal substance had been identified as a heavy metal and it was widely presumed that the Chisso factory was the source of the contamination. Chisso was coming under closer scrutiny and to deflect criticism, the wastewater output route was changed. Chisso knew of the environmental damage caused by its wastewater and was aware that it was the prime suspect in the investigation. Despite this, from September 1958, instead of discharging its waste into Hyakken Harbour (the focus of investigation and source of original contamination), it discharged wastewater directly into Minamata River. The immediate effect was the death of fish at the mouth of the river, and from that point on, new Minamata disease victims began to appear in other fishing villages up and down the coast of the Shiranui Sea as the pollution spread.

Chisso failed to co-operate with the Kumadai research team. It withheld information on its industrial processes, leaving researchers to speculate what products the factory was producing and by what methods. The Chisso factory&#x27;s hospital director, Hajime Hosokawa, established a laboratory in the research division of the facility to carry out his own experiments into Minamata disease in July 1959. In one experiment, Hosokawa added factory wastewater to food that was then fed to healthy cats. Seventy-eight days into the experiment, cat 400 exhibited symptoms of Minamata disease, and pathological examinations confirmed a diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning. Chisso did not reveal these results to the investigators and ordered Hosokawa to stop his research.

In an attempt to undermine the Kumadai researchers&#x27; organic mercury theory, Chisso and other parties with a vested interest that the factory remain open (including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Japan Chemical Industry Association) funded research into alternative causes of the disease, other than its own waste.

=== Compensation of fishermen and patients, 1959 ===
Polluting wastewater had damaged the fisheries around Minamata ever since the opening of the Chisso factory in 1908. The Minamata Fishing Cooperative had managed to win small payments of &quot;sympathy money&quot; from the company in 1926 and again in 1943, but after the outbreak of Minamata disease, the fishing situation became critical. Fishing catches declined by 91% between 1953 and 1957. The Kumamoto prefectural government issued a partial ban on the sale of fish caught in the heavily polluted Minamata Bay but not an all-out ban, which would have legally obliged it to compensate the fishermen. The fishing cooperative protested against Chisso and angrily forced their way into the factory on 6 August and 12 August, demanding compensation. A committee was set up by Minamata Mayor Todomu Nakamura to mediate between the two sides, but this committee was stacked heavily in the company&#x27;s favour. On 29 August, the fishing cooperative agreed to the mediation committee&#x27;s proposal, stating: &quot;In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept&quot;. Chisso paid the cooperative ¥20 million (US$183,477 — about US$1.7 million in 2021 value) and set up a ¥15 million ($137,608 — about 1.25 million today) fund to promote the recovery of fishing.

After Chisso changed the route of wastewater output in 1958, pollution had spread up and down the Shiranui Sea, damaging fisheries there as well. Emboldened by the success of the small Minamata cooperative, the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives also decided to seek compensation from Chisso. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory to demand negotiations. When this produced no results, the alliance members took their campaign to Tokyo, securing an official visit to Minamata by members of the Japanese Diet. During the visit on 2 November, alliance members forced their way into the factory and rioted, causing many injuries and ¥10 million ($100,000) in damage. The violence was covered widely in the media, bringing the nation&#x27;s attention to Minamata for the first time since the outbreak began. Another mediation committee was set up, and an agreement was hammered out and signed on 17 December. Some ¥25 million of &quot;sympathy money&quot; was paid to the alliance, and a ¥65 million fishing recovery fund was established.

In 1959, those affected by Minamata disease were in a much weaker bargaining position than the fishermen. The recently formed Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society was much more divided than the fishing cooperatives. Patients&#x27; families were the victims of discrimination and ostracism from the local community. Local people felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin. To some patients, this rejection from the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself. After staging a sit-in at the Chisso factory gates in November 1959, the patients asked Kumamoto Prefecture Governor Hirosaku Teramoto to include the patients&#x27; request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. Chisso agreed, and after a few weeks&#x27; further negotiation, another &quot;sympathy money&quot; agreement was signed. Patients who were certified by a Ministry of Health and Welfare committee would be compensated: adult patients received ¥100,000 ($917) per year; children ¥30,000 ($275) per year, and families of dead patients would receive a one-off ¥320,000 ($2935) payment.

=== Wastewater treatment ===

On 21 October 1959, Chisso was ordered by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry reroute its wastewater drainage from the Minamata River back to Hyakken Harbour, and to speed up the installation of wastewater treatment systems at the factory. Chisso installed a Cyclator purification system on 19 December 1959, and opened it with a special ceremony. Chisso&#x27;s president Kiichi Yoshioka drank a glass of water supposedly treated through the Cyclator to demonstrate that it was safe. In fact, the wastewater from the factory, which the company knew still contained mercury and led to Minamata disease when fed to cats, was not being treated through the Cyclator at the time. Testimony at a later Niigata Minamata disease trial proved that Chisso knew the Cyclator to be completely ineffective: &quot;The purification tank was installed as a social solution and did nothing to remove organic mercury.&quot;

The deception was successful, and almost all parties affected by Minamata disease were duped into believing that the factory&#x27;s wastewater had been made safe from December 1959 onward. This widespread assumption meant that doctors were not expecting new patients to appear, resulting in numerous problems in the years to follow as the pollution continued. In most people&#x27;s minds, the issue of Minamata disease had been resolved.

== 1959–1969 ==

The years between the first set of &quot;sympathy money&quot; agreements in 1959 and the start of the first legal action to be taken against Chisso in 1969 are often called the &quot;ten years of silence.&quot; This was inaccurate - much activity on the part of the patients and fishermen took place during this period, but nothing had a significant impact on the actions of the company or the coverage of Minamata in the Japanese media.

=== Continued pollution ===

Despite the almost universal assumption to the contrary, the wastewater treatment facilities installed in December 1959 had no effect on the level of organic mercury being released into the Shiranui Sea. The pollution and the disease it caused continued to spread. The Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectural governments conducted a joint survey in late 1960 and early 1961 to measure the level of mercury in the hair of people living around the Shiranui Sea. The results confirmed that organic mercury had spread all around the inland sea and that people were still being poisoned by contaminated fish. Hundreds of people were discovered to have levels greater than 50 ppm of mercury in their hair, the level at which people are likely to experience nerve damage. The highest result recorded was that of a woman from Goshonoura island whose sample had a mercury level of 920 ppm.

The prefectural governments did not publish the results and did nothing in response to these surveys. The participants who had donated hair samples were not informed of their results, even when they requested them. A follow-up study ten years later discovered that many had died from &quot;unknown causes&quot; during this time period.

=== Congenital Minamata disease ===

Local doctors and medical officials had noticed an abnormally high frequency of cerebral palsy and other infantile disorders in the Minamata area. In 1961, a number of medical professionals, including Masazumi Harada (later to be honored by the United Nations for his body of work on Minamata disease), set about re-examining children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The symptoms of the children closely mirrored those of adult Minamata disease patients, but many of their mothers did not exhibit symptoms. The fact that these children had been born after the initial outbreak and had never been fed contaminated fish also led their mothers to believe they were not victims. At the time, the medical establishment believed the placenta would protect the foetus from toxins in the bloodstream, which is the case with most chemicals, but in the case of methylmercury the placenta removes it from the mother&#x27;s bloodstream and concentrates it in the foetus. This was unknown at the time.

After several years of study and the autopsies of two children, the doctors announced that these children had an as-yet unrecognised congenital form of Minamata disease. The certification committee convened on 29 November 1962 and agreed that the two dead children and the sixteen children still alive should be certified as patients, and therefore liable for &quot;sympathy money&quot; from Chisso, in line with the 1959 agreement.

=== Outbreak of Niigata Minamata disease ===
Minamata disease broke out again in 1965, this time along the banks of the Agano River in Niigata Prefecture. The polluting factory (owned by Showa Denko) employed a chemical process using a mercury catalyst very similar to that used by Chisso in Minamata. As in Minamata, from the autumn of 1964 to the spring of 1965, cats living along the banks of the Agano River had been seen to go mad and die. Before long, patients appeared with identical symptoms to patients living on the Shiranui Sea, and the outbreak was made public on 12 June 1965. Researchers from the Kumamoto University Research Group and Hajime Hosokawa (who had retired from Chisso in 1962) used their experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. In September 1966, a report was issued proving Showa Denko&#x27;s pollution to be the cause of this second Minamata disease outbreak.

Unlike the patients in Minamata, the victims of Showa Denko&#x27;s pollution lived a considerable distance from the factory and had no particular link to the company. As a result, the local community was much more supportive of patients&#x27; groups and a lawsuit was filed against Showa Denko in March 1968, only three years after discovery.

The events in Niigata catalysed a change in response to the original Minamata incident. The scientific research carried out in Niigata forced a re-examination of that done in Minamata, and the decision of Niigata patients to sue the polluting company allowed the same response to be considered in Minamata. Masazumi Harada has said that, &quot;It may sound strange, but if this second Minamata disease had not broken out, the medical and social progress achieved by now in Kumamoto... would have been impossible.&quot;

Around this time, two other pollution-related diseases were also grabbing headlines in Japan. People with Yokkaichi asthma and itai-itai disease were forming citizens&#x27; groups and filed lawsuits against the polluting companies in September 1967 and March 1968, respectively. As a group, these diseases came to be known as the four big pollution diseases of Japan.

Slowly but surely, the mood in Minamata and Japan as a whole was shifting. Minamata patients found the public gradually becoming more receptive and sympathetic as the decade wore on. This culminated in 1968 with the establishment in Minamata of the Citizens&#x27; Council for Minamata Disease Countermeasures, which was to become the chief citizens&#x27; support group to the Minamata patients. A founding member of the citizens&#x27; council was Michiko Ishimure, a local housewife and poet who later that year published &quot;Pure Land, Poisoned Sea: Our Minamata disease&quot;, a book of poetic essays that received national acclaim.

== 1969–1973 ==

=== Official government recognition ===

Finally on 26 September 1968 – twelve years after the discovery of the disease (and four months after Chisso had stopped production of acetaldehyde using its mercury catalyst) – the Japanese government issued an official conclusion as to the cause of Minamata disease:

The conclusion contained many factual errors: eating fish and shellfish from other areas of the Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to accept responsibility for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.

=== Struggle for a new agreement ===

In light of the government announcement, the patients of the Mutual Aid Society decided to ask for a new compensation agreement with Chisso and submitted the demand on 6 October. Chisso replied that it was unable to judge what would be fair compensation and asked the Japanese government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients&#x27; society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in 1959 with unfortunate results. At a meeting on the 5 April 1969, the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the pro-arbitration group and the litigation group (who decided to sue the company). That summer, Chisso sent gifts to the families who opted for arbitration rather than litigation.

An arbitration committee was duly set up by the Ministry of Health and Welfare on 25 April, but it took almost a year to draw up a draft compensation plan. A newspaper leak in March 1970 revealed that the committee would ask Chisso to pay only ¥2 million ($5,600) for dead patients and ¥140,000 to ¥200,000 ($390 to $560) per year to surviving patients. The arbitration group were dismayed by the sums on offer. They petitioned the committee, together with patients and supporters of the litigation group, for a fairer deal. The arbitration committee announced their compensation plan on 25 May in a disorderly session at the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. Thirteen protesters were arrested.

Instead of accepting the agreement as they had promised, the arbitration group asked for increases. The committee was forced to revise its plan and the patients waited inside the ministry building for two days while they did so. The final agreement was signed on 27 May. Payments for deaths ranged from ¥1.7 million to ¥4 million ($4,700 to $11,100), one-time payments from ¥1 million to ¥4.2 million ($2,760 to $11,660) and annual payments between ¥170,000 and ¥380,000 ($470 to $1,100) for surviving patients. On the day of the signing, the Minamata Citizens&#x27; Council held a protest outside the Chisso factory gates. One of the Chisso trade unions held an eight-hour strike in protest at the poor treatment of the arbitration group by their own company.

The litigation group, representing 41 certified patients (17 already deceased) in 28 families, submitted their suit against Chisso in the Kumamoto District Court on 14 June 1969. The leader of the group, Eizō Watanabe (a former leader of the Mutual Aid Society), declared, &quot;Today, and from this day forth, we are fighting against the power of the state.&quot; Those who decided to sue the company came under fierce pressure to drop their lawsuits. One woman was visited personally by a Chisso executive and harassed by her neighbours. She was blackballed by the community, her family&#x27;s fishing boat used without permission, their fishing nets were cut, and human faeces were thrown at her in the street.

The litigation group and their lawyers were helped substantially by an informal national network of citizens&#x27; groups that had sprung up around the country in 1969. The Associations to Indict those Responsible for Minamata Disease were instrumental in raising awareness and funds for the lawsuit. The Kumamoto branch, in particular, was especially helpful to the case. In September 1969, they set up a Trial Research Group, which included law professors, medical researchers (including Harada), sociologists and even Michiko Ishimure to provide useful material to the lawyers to improve their legal arguments. Their report, &quot;Corporate Responsibility for Minamata Disease: Chisso&#x27;s Illegal Acts&quot;, published in August 1970, formed the basis of the ultimately successful lawsuit.

The trial lasted almost four years. The litigation group&#x27;s lawyers sought to prove Chisso&#x27;s corporate negligence. Three main legal points had to be overcome to win the case. First, the lawyers had to show that methylmercury caused Minamata disease and that the company&#x27;s factory was the source of pollution. The extensive research by Kumadai and the government&#x27;s conclusion meant that this point was proved quite easily. Second, they needed to show that Chisso could and should have anticipated the effect of its wastewater and taken steps to prevent the tragedy (i.e., was the company negligent in its duty of care). Third, it had to disprove that the &quot;sympathy money&quot; agreement of 1959, which forbade the patients from claiming any further compensation, was a legally binding contract.

The trial heard from patients and their families, but the most important testimony came from Chisso executives and employees. The most dramatic testimony came from Hosokawa, who spoke on 4 July 1970 from his hospital bed where he was dying of cancer. Hosokawa explained his experiments with cats, including the infamous &quot;cat 400&quot;, which developed Minamata disease after being fed factory wastewater. He also spoke of his opposition to the 1958 change in wastewater output route to Minamata River. Hosokawa&#x27;s testimony was backed up by a colleague who also told how Chisso officials had ordered them to halt their cat experiments in the autumn of 1959. Hosokawa died three months after giving his testimony. Former factory manager Eiichi Nishida admitted that the company put profits ahead of safety, resulting in dangerous working conditions and a lack of care with mercury. Former Chisso President Kiichi Yoshioka admitted that the company promoted a theory of dumped World War II explosives, though it knew it to be unfounded.

The verdict handed down on 20 March 1973 represented a complete victory for the patients of the litigation group:

The &quot;sympathy money&quot; agreement was found to be invalid and Chisso was ordered to make one-time payments of ¥18 million ($66,000) for each deceased patient and from ¥16 million to ¥18 million ($59,000 to $66,000) for each surviving patient. The total compensation of ¥937 million ($3.4 million) was the largest sum ever awarded by a Japanese court.

=== Uncertified patients&#x27; fight to be recognised ===

While the struggles of the arbitration and litigation groups against Chisso were continuing, a new group of individuals with Minamata disease emerged. To qualify for compensation under the 1959 agreement, patients had to be officially recognised by various &quot;ad hoc&quot; certification committees according to their symptoms. However, in an effort to limit the liability and financial burden on the company, these committees were sticking to a rigid interpretation of Minamata disease. They required that patients must exhibit all symptoms of Hunter-Russell syndrome – the standard diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning at the time, which originated from an industrial accident in the United Kingdom in 1940. The committee certified only patients exhibiting explicit symptoms of the British syndrome, rather than basing their diagnosis on the disease in Japan. This resulted in many applicants being rejected by the committee, leaving them confused and frustrated.

==Legacies==

===Epidemiology===

As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially certified and over 10,000 people had received financial compensation from Chisso, although they were not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated, as a full epidemiological study has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation. Many individuals with Minamata disease faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community if they came out into the open about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, those affected were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as having Minamata disease, the certification council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that some of the people who sought compensation did not actually have the disease. More properly, the impact should be called a criminal &#x27;poisoning&#x27;, not a clinical &#x27;disease&#x27;. These forms of obfuscation are commonly experienced by &#x27;environmental victims&#x27; in many countries.

In 1978, the National Institute for Minamata Disease was established in Minamata. It consists of four departments: The Department of Basic Medical Science, The Department of Clinical Medicine, The Department of Epidemiology and The Department of International Affairs and Environmental Sciences. In 1986, The Institute became a WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Health Effects of Mercury Compounds. The Institute seeks to improve medical treatment of Minamata disease patients and conducts research on mercury compounds and their impact on organisms as well as potential detoxification mechanisms. In April, 2008 the Institute invented a method for absorbing gaseous mercury in order to prevent air pollution and enable recycling of the metal.

===Environmental protection===

The movement for redress by Minamata victims and activists and the national outrage their movement elicited played a central role in the rise of environmental protection in Japan. The 1970 session of the Japanese Diet became remembered as the &quot;Pollution Diet&quot;, as the Japanese government took action under rising pressure from the Minamata disease movement as well as other major environmental catastrophes such as Yokkaichi asthma and itai-itai disease. Fourteen new environmental laws were passed in a single session, giving Japan what at the time were the most stringent environmental protection laws in the world. These new laws included a Water Pollution Act and nationwide regulations of toxic discharges. The &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle was introduced. A national Environmental Agency, which later developed into the Ministry of Environment, was founded in 1971. National governmental expenditures on environmental issues almost doubled between 1970 and 1975 and tripled at the local government level.

===Democratizing effects===

According to historian Timothy S. George, the environmental protests that surrounded the disease appeared to aid in the democratization of Japan. When the first cases were reported and subsequently suppressed, the rights of the victims were not recognised, and they were given no compensation. Instead, the affected were ostracised from their community due to ignorance about the disease, as people were afraid that it was contagious.

The people directly impacted by the pollution of Minamata Bay were not originally allowed to participate in actions that would affect their future. Disease victims, fishing families, and company employees were excluded from the debate. Progress occurred when Minamata victims were finally allowed to come to a meeting to discuss the issue. As a result, postwar Japan took a small step toward democracy.

Through the evolution of public sentiments, the victims and environmental protesters were able to acquire standing and proceed more effectively in their cause. The involvement of the press also aided the process of democratization because it caused more people to become aware of the facts of Minamata disease and the pollution that caused it. However, although the environmental protests did result in Japan becoming more democratized, it did not completely rid Japan of the system that first suppressed the fishermen and individuals with Minamata disease.

===Popular culture===

Toshiko Akiyoshi, touched by the plight of the fishing village, wrote a jazz suite, &quot;Minamata&quot;, that was to be the central piece of the Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Big Band&#x27;s 1976 album on RCA, &quot;Insights&quot;. The piece was constructed in three parts, to musically reflect the tragedy – &quot;Peaceful Village&quot;, &quot;Prosperity &amp; Consequence&quot;, and &quot;Epilogue&quot;. Akiyoshi used Japanese vocalists to sing the Japanese lyrics of a tone poem that were part of the composition. The album won many awards in jazz circles, including &quot;Downbeat&quot; best album award, largely on the strength of this piece, which brought some further attention to the tragedy.

The song &quot;Kepone Factory&quot; on Dead Kennedys&#x27; &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; makes reference to the disaster in its chorus.

The song &quot;The Disease of the Dancing Cats&quot; by the band Bush on the album &quot;The Science of Things&quot; is in reference to the disaster.

In 2021 a manga/comic book about Minamata disease was made with the cooperation of various disease suffers and long term helper and activist, Takeko Kato. The Scottish writer Sean Michael Wilson and Japanese artist Akiko Shimojima collaborated on the book, called &quot;The Minamata Story: an ecotragedy&quot;, which was published in English by Stonebridge Press, and went on to win two awards.

===Visual documentation===
Photographic documentation of Minamata started in the early 1960s. One photographer who arrived in 1960 was Shisei Kuwabara, straight from university and photo school, who had his photographs published in &quot;Weekly Asahi&quot; as early as May 1960. The first exhibition of his photographs of Minamata was held in the Fuji Photo Salon in Tokyo in 1962, and the first of his book-length anthologies, &quot;Minamata Disease&quot;, was published in Japan in 1965. He has returned to Minamata many times since.

A dramatic photographic essay by W. Eugene Smith brought world attention to Minamata disease. He and his Japanese wife lived in Minamata from 1971 to 1973. The most famous and striking photo of the essay, &quot;Tomoko and Mother in the Bath&quot; (1972), shows Ryoko Kamimura holding her severely deformed daughter, Tomoko, in a Japanese bath chamber. Tomoko was poisoned by methylmercury while still in the womb. The photo was very widely published. It was posed by Smith with the co-operation of Ryoko and Tomoko to dramatically illustrate the consequences of the disease. It has subsequently been withdrawn from circulation at the request of Tomoko&#x27;s family, so does not appear in recent anthologies of Smith&#x27;s works. Smith and his wife were extremely dedicated to the cause of the people with Minamata disease, closely documenting their struggle for recognition and right to compensation. Smith was himself attacked and seriously injured by Chisso employees in an incident in Goi, Ichihara city, near Tokyo on January 7, 1972, in an attempt to stop the photographer from further revealing the issue to the world. The 54-year-old Smith survived the attack, but his sight in one eye deteriorated and his health never fully recovered before his death in 1978. Johnny Depp plays W. Eugene Smith in &quot;Minamata&quot; (2020) a drama based on the book written by Smith&#x27;s wife.

Japanese photographer Takeshi Ishikawa, who assisted Smith in Minamata, has since exhibited his own photographs documenting the disease. His photographs cover the years 1971 to the present, with Minamata victims as his subjects.

The prominent Japanese documentary filmmaker Noriaki Tsuchimoto made a series of films, starting with &quot;&quot; (1971) and including &quot;The Shiranui Sea&quot; (1975), documenting the incident and siding with the victims in their struggle against Chisso and the government.

Kikujiro Fukushima, a well-known Japanese photographer and journalist, published a series of photographs in 1980 concerning pollution in Japan, including Minamata disease. Some negatives of these photos are available on the website, and Kyodo News Images holds the rights to them.

===Today===

Minamata disease remains an important issue in contemporary Japanese society. Lawsuits against Chisso and the prefectural and national governments are still continuing and many regard the government responses to date as inadequate. The company&#x27;s &quot;historical overview&quot; in its current website makes no mention of their role in the mass contamination of Minamata and the dreadful aftermath. Their 2004 Annual Report, however, reports an equivalent of about US$50 million (5,820 million yen) in &quot;Minamata Disease Compensation Liabilities&quot;. From 2000 to 2003, the company also reported total compensation liabilities of over US$170 million. Their 2000 accounts also show that the Japanese and Kumamoto prefectural governments waived an enormous US$560 million in related liabilities. Their FY2004 and FY2005 reports refer to Minamata disease as &quot;mad hatter&#x27;s disease&quot;, a term coined from the mercury poisoning experienced by hat-makers of the last few centuries (cf. Erethism).

A memorial service was held at the Minamata Disease Municipal Museum on 1 May 2006 to mark 50 years since the official discovery of the disease. Despite bad weather, the service was attended by over 600 people, including Chisso chairman Shunkichi Goto and Environment Minister Yuriko Koike.

On Monday, March 29, 2010, a group of 2,123 uncertified victims reached a settlement with the government of Japan, the Kumamoto Prefectural government, and Chisso Corporation to receive individual lump-sum payments of 2.1 million yen and monthly medical allowances.

Most congenital patients are now in their forties and fifties and their health is deteriorating. Their parents, who are often their only source of care, are into their seventies or eighties or already deceased. Often, these patients find themselves tied to their own homes and the care of their family, effectively isolated from the local community. Some welfare facilities for patients do exist. One notable example is Hot House, a vocational training centre for congenital patients as well as other disabled people in the Minamata area. Hot House members are also involved in raising awareness of Minamata disease, often attending conferences and seminars as well as making regular visits to elementary schools throughout Kumamoto Prefecture.

<text>The 9M133 Kornet (; &quot;Cornet&quot;, NATO reporting name AT-14 [[Spriggan]], export designation Kornet-E) is a Russian man-portable anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) intended for use against main battle tanks. It was first introduced into service with the Russian army in 1998.

The Kornet is among the most capable Russian ATGMs. It was further developed into the 9M133 Kornet-EM, which has increased range, an improved warhead, and equipped with an automatic target tracker (fire-and-forget capability).

The Kornet has been widely exported and is produced under license in several countries. It was first used in combat in 2003 and has since been used in many conflicts.

==Development==
The Kornet anti-tank missile was unveiled in October 1994 by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. The missile started development in 1988 as a modular, universal system able to engage any target from a mix of platforms using a reliable laser beam guidance system that was simple to use. It is a heavy ATGM, superior to the earlier 9K111 Fagot (NATO: AT-4 Spigot) and 9K113 Konkurs (NATO: AT-5 Spandrel) wire-guided ATGMs, but is not intended to replace them (due to the cost). The missile entered service in the Russian army in 1998. Its export designation is the Kornet-E. The 9P163M-1 Kornet-T tank destroyer entered service in 2012.

North Korea has developed a clone of the Kornet known as the &quot;Bulsae&quot;-3 (), which was first revealed on 27 February 2016 publicly during a demo test.

The 9M133F-1 Kornet variant with a thermobaric warhead was expected to enter serial production in 2019, according to a company report.

The NATO reporting name &quot;AT-14 Spriggan&quot; is derived from the spriggan, a legendary creature from Cornish faery lore.

==Description==
The 9M133 missile together with its 9P163-1 tripod launcher and 1PN79-1 thermal sight (part of the 1P45-1 guidance device), form the 9K135 missile system, which can be carried and operated by a two-person infantry crew. The transfer to the firing position takes less than one minute, and preparation and production of a shot in at least one second. When it&#x27;s fired above the sight line, the Kornet ATGM allows attacking the target’s upper semi-sphere, as the armor is usually thinnest on the top of a vehicle.
In addition to an infantry portable version, the 9K133 system has been integrated into a variety of other vehicles and weapons systems as either an upgrade package or a new weapon system. The 9K133 has been fitted into a BMP-3 to form the 9P163M-1 tank destroyer and is similar in function to the Khrizantema missile system. The 9P163M-1 carries two 9M133 missiles on launch rails, which are extended from a stowed position during transit. Missiles are re-loaded automatically by the tank destroyer from an internal magazine with 16 rounds (missiles are stored and transported in sealed canisters). NBC protection is provided for the two crew (gunner and driver) of each 9P163M-1 in addition to full armour protection equivalent to the standard BMP-3 chassis. The guidance system of the 9P163M-1 allows two missiles to be fired at once, each operating on different guidance (laser) channels. 

The KBP Instrument Design Bureau has also marketed the 9M133 missile as part of the Kvartet system for mounting on vehicles and boats; the system has four missiles on ready-to-launch rails along with associated guidance and sighting system all packaged in a single turret; the guidance system also allows two missiles to be fired at once. The turret has space for an additional five rounds and is operated by a single individual. Another upgrade possibility is the Kliver missile and gun turret, seen as an upgrade option for the BTR series of APC, BMP-1 IFV and patrol boats. It has similar capabilities as the Kvartet turret, but also carries a 30 mm 2A72 cannon; turret weight is 1,500 kg. Finally the 9M133 is also available in the BEREZHOK turret upgrade also made available by KBP. Since 2014, its serial production has been resumed for the domestic market with the designation B05YA01.

===Kornet-EM===
The 9M133 Kornet-EM is an improved variant introduced in 2012 that is designed to defeat vehicles with explosive reactive armor (ERA). Its vehicle mounted version is equipped with an automatic target tracker in lieu of a proper fire-and-forget capability. Instead of manually placing the crosshairs on target throughout the missiles flight, the operator designates a target once and the computer tracks the target as the missile travels towards it until impact. New beam coding also allows a vehicle equipped with twin launchers to attack two different targets at once, increasing its rate of fire, decreases the number of vehicles needed for a mission, and can defeat vehicles equipped with an active protection system through salvo fire at one target. The system&#x27;s use of an autotracker can make it effective against low-flying aerial threats like helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Kornet-EM is mainly used on the Kornet-D system. A remote-control system intended for firing the Kornet-EM missile completed testing in February 2025. The station reportedly has artificial intelligence elements.

The Kornet-EM first entered service with the Russian Army; its first export customer was Bahrain. It has also been exported to Algeria. It is built under license in Saudi Arabia.

=== Tharallah ===
Tharallah is a twin-Kornet system used by the Hezbollah since 2015. It consists of a quadripod equipped with two Kornet tubes to be launched in quick succession. This arrangement is designed to overwhelm the Trophy APS of Merkava tanks by having a second missile available before the APS can react after the first intercept.

==9M134 Bulat==

The 9M134 Bulat is a lightweight variant of the 9M133 Kornet ATGM, optimized for engaging medium-armored targets such as IFVs and APCs. Weighing only 6.5 kg in its container, it is about four times lighter than other Kornet missiles, enhancing mobility and allowing teams to carry more ammunition. The missile has a range of 3.5+ km and features a tandem warhead with 250 mm penetration capability, effective even against reactive armor. Guided by a noiseless laser beam, the Bulat integrates with existing Kornet systems, providing a cost-effective solution for lighter threats while reserving heavier Kornet munitions for tanks. First showcased at the Army-2024 forum, the Bulat highlights Russia’s focus on versatile anti-tank solutions. Its trials completed in February 2025.

==Combat history==

During the Iraq War, Kornets were used by some groups of Iraqi special forces to attack U.S. armored vehicles, disabling at least two Abrams tanks and one Bradley infantry fighting vehicle in the opening week of the war.

The second verified episode of the Kornet ATGM in combat use occurred during the 2006 Lebanon War, where the missiles, reportedly supplied by Syria which were reverse-engineered Kornets produced in North Korea, were used by Hezbollah fighters to destroy up to four Israeli Merkava tanks. Kornets pierced the armor of 24 tanks in total. One of the first detailed accounts of IDF&#x27;s successful capture of Kornet ATGMs on Hezbollah positions in the village of Ghandouriyeh appeared in a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article, which also reported that the boxes were marked with &quot;Customer: Ministry of Defense of Syria. Supplier: KBP, Tula, Russia&quot;. Several months after the cease-fire, reports have provided sufficient photographic evidence that Kornet ATGMs were indeed both in possession of, and used by, Hezbollah in this area.

Israel claims that Russian weapons were smuggled to Hezbollah by Syria, and Israel has sent a team of officials to Moscow to show Russia the evidence of what they say can only be Syrian weapons transfers. Russian officials denied that Russian Kornet ended up in the hands of Hezbollah, adding that the anti-tank weapons used by Hezbollah were different. On 6 December 2010, a Kornet launched from the Gaza strip penetrated the outer armour of a Merkava Mark III tank on the Israeli side of the border, but it caused no injuries.

On 7 April 2011, Hamas claimed responsibility for a missile strike on an Israeli yellow school bus which killed a 16-year-old boy, Daniel Viflic, and wounded another civilian (all the other children who were on the bus had left a few minutes earlier). According to Israeli military spokesman, the bus was hit by a Kornet missile.

During the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in the summer of 2014, of the 15 anti-tank missiles launched at Israeli tanks that were intercepted by the Israeli active protection system Trophy, most were of the Kornet type. In some cases the Kornet launchers were destroyed after the Trophy system had detected the launch and directed the tank&#x27;s main gun to the launcher position.

In the summer of 2014 the armor of Iraqi Army M1A1 Abrams tanks was penetrated 5 times: Kornet missiles were responsible for at least some of these penetrations.
In September 2014, the Iraqi Army used Kornet missiles against Islamic State militants for the first time. Iraqi security forces claimed five IS-operated vehicles along with fighters were destroyed in Diyala Governorate. Three Iraqi Army squadrons have been trained to use the Kornet anti-tank missile.

In the January 2015 Shebaa farms incident, Hezbollah fired some Kornet anti-tank missiles against two Israeli Humvees. A soldier and an officer were killed. In 2015 Iran succeeded in reverse-engineering the Kornet. Iran arms Hezbollah and there is speculation Iranian Kornets were used against Israel in the border attack.

After the 2011 Libyan civil war, the Libyan army&#x27;s stockpiles were looted and many weapons, including Kornet missiles, proliferated through the region. Many of the Kornet missiles fell in the hands of Ansar Bait al-Maqdis in Egypt&#x27;s Sinai peninsula. In the Sinai insurgency, Kornet missiles become a key weapon in attacking Egyptian Armed Forces. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis has used the missile on M1A1 and M60 tanks, helicopters (AH-64) and a navy ship. The group has since become a branch of ISIL, renaming itself ISIL-Sinai Province.

Reuters have found remains of used Kornet missiles in Ukraine in the context of the 2014–2015 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Since Ukraine is not a known operator of Kornet, Reuters quoted the International Institute for Strategic Studies that the missiles were most likely sent into Ukraine by Russia.

Russia has sent over 1,000 Kornet-9M133 anti-tank guided missiles to the Syrian Government who have used them extensively against armour and ground targets to fight Jihadists and rebels. In 2016, a Syrian Army Solntsepyok TOS-1 was destroyed by a Kornet missile from unknown Syrian opposition forces.

Iran has supplied their license-built Kornet missiles, under their name Dehalivieh, to at least one Iraqi non-state actor. In addition, Kornet missiles were widely used in the Iraqi Civil War by the Iraqi government and the Popular Mobilization Units.

In January 2017, the German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; reported that ISIL fighters used Kornets to destroy six Leopard 2 tanks used by the Turkish military in Syria. An ISIL propaganda video released in March 2017 showed ISIL fighters capturing two Kornets being transported in Syria, which show the manufacturing year of 2016.

On 1 September 2019, a Kornet was used by Hezbollah forces to fire on Israeli military stations in retaliation for the bombings of a Hezbollah media office a week earlier. Israel responded with artillery barrages on Lebanese villages close to the border, specifically Aitaroun and Maroun al-Ras, which set fire to a number of civilian crop fields.

On 26 February 2022, a Kornet was used by Russian troops against a Ukrainian armored vehicle. In October 2022 a Russian Kornet was captured by Ukrainian Naval Infantry. In July 2023, Russian troops first used the Kornet ATGM in conjunction with the Kurgan remote control system. On 30 October 2023, a video shows one Stridsvagn 122 tank was destroyed after hit by what was claimed to be a Kornet. A Kornet missile’s 10-pound warhead can punch through more than 1,000 mm of armor behind ERA.

On 4 September 2023, a video emerged from Robotyne which showed the first combat loss of the Challenger 2 tank. The tank was disabled by a mine and then reportedly hit by a Kornet missile and burst into flames. A missile triggered a fire that apparently cooked off the Challenger 2&#x27;s ammunition charges in their special containers. Filled with water, these containers are supposed to prevent catastrophic secondary explosions, but they failed, and the resulting blast wrenched the Challenger 2&#x27;s turret from its hull.

In October 2023, Hezbollah used Kornet missiles during engagements with Israeli forces after the onset of the 2023 Israel-Hamas War. The missiles were used from the Tharallah Twin ATGM system, which is a quadripod equipped with two Kornets fired in rapid succession. This arrangement is designed to overwhelm the Trophy APS of Merkava tanks by having a second missile available before the APS can react after the first intercept. Hezbollah reportedly acquired the Tharallah ATGM system in 2015. Videos in July 2024 also show the Qassam Brigades successfully destroying and igniting a Namer and a Merkava tank, which were both equipped with a Trophy APS and in both cases it had failed to intercept the shell.

<text>James Gleick (; born August 1, 1954) is an American author and historian of science whose work has chronicled the cultural impact of modern technology. Recognized for his writing about complex subjects through the techniques of narrative nonfiction, he has been called &quot;one of the great science writers of all time&quot;. He is part of the inspiration for Jurassic Park character Ian Malcolm.

Gleick&#x27;s books include the international bestsellers &quot;&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood&quot; (2011). Three of his books have been Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award finalists; and &quot;The Information&quot; was awarded the PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award in 2012 and the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books 2012. His books have been translated into more than thirty languages.

==Life==
A native of New York City, Gleick attended Harvard College, where he was an editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, graduating in 1976 with an A.B. degree in English and linguistics. 

=== Writing career ===
He moved to Minneapolis and helped found an alternative weekly newspaper, &quot;Metropolis&quot;. After its demise a year later, he returned to New York and in 1979 joined the staff of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He worked there for ten years as an editor on the metropolitan desk and then as a science reporter. Among the scientists Gleick profiled in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; were Douglas Hofstadter, Stephen Jay Gould, Mitchell Feigenbaum, and Benoit Mandelbrot. His early reporting on Microsoft anticipated the antitrust investigations by the U. S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. 

He wrote the &quot;Fast Forward&quot; column in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; from 1995 to 1999, and his essays charting the growth of the Internet formed the basis of his book &quot;What Just Happened&quot;. His work has also appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;the Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and he is a regular contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. 

His first book, &quot;&quot;, reported the development of the new science of chaos and complexity. It made the butterfly effect a household term, introduced the Mandelbrot set and fractal geometry to a broad audience, and sparked popular interest in the subject, influencing such diverse writers as Tom Stoppard (&quot;Arcadia&quot;) and Michael Crichton (&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;).

After the publication of &quot;Chaos&quot;, he collaborated with photographer Eliot Porter on &quot;Nature&#x27;s Chaos&quot; and with developers at Autodesk on &quot;Chaos: The Software&quot;. His next books included two biographies, &quot;Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman&quot;, and &quot;Isaac Newton&quot;, which John Banville said would &quot;surely stand as the definitive study for a very long time to come.&quot;

Gleick&#x27;s writing style has been described as a combination of &quot;clear mind, magpie-styled research and explanatory verve.&quot; In 1989–90 he was the McGraw Distinguished Lecturer at Princeton University. In 2000 he was the first editor of &quot;The Best American Science Writing&quot; series. Gleick was elected president of the Authors Guild in 2017.

===The Pipeline===
As a reaction to poor user experience with procmail configuration at Panix, in 1993 Gleick founded The Pipeline, one of the earliest Internet service providers in New York City. The Pipeline was the first ISP to offer a graphical user interface, incorporating e-mail, chat, Usenet, and the World Wide Web, through software for Windows and Mac operating systems. 

Gleick and business partner Uday Ivatury licensed the Pipeline software to other Internet service providers in the United States and overseas. In 1995 Gleick sold The Pipeline to PSINet, where it was later absorbed into MindSpring and then EarthLink.

===Aircraft accident===
On 20 December 1997 Gleick was attempting to land his Rutan Long-EZ experimental plane at Greenwood Lake Airport in West Milford, New Jersey, when a build-up of ice in the engine&#x27;s carburetor caused the aircraft engine to lose power and the plane landed short of the runway into rising terrain. The impact killed Gleick&#x27;s adopted eight-year-old son, Harry, and left Gleick seriously injured.

<doc id="312199" wikidata="Q7773433" url="?curid=312199" title="The Wanderings of Oisin">
<text>The Wanderings of Oisin ( ) is an epic poem published by William Butler Yeats in 1889 in the book &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems&quot;. It was his first publication outside magazines, and immediately won him a reputation as a significant poet. This narrative poem takes the form of a dialogue between the aged Irish hero Oisín and St. Patrick, the man traditionally responsible for converting Ireland to Christianity. Most of the poem is spoken by Oisin, relating his 300-year sojourn in the isles of Faerie. The poem was not popular among modernist critics like T. S. Eliot. However, Harold Bloom defended this poem in his book-length study of Yeats, and concludes that it deserves reconsideration.

==Story==

The fairy princess Niamh fell in love with Oisin&#x27;s poetry and begged him to join her in the immortal islands. For a hundred years he lived as one of the Sidhe, hunting, dancing, and feasting. At the end of this time he found a spear washed up on the shore and grew sad, remembering his times with the Fianna. Niamh took him away to another island, where the ancient and abandoned castle of the sea-god Manannan stood. Here they found another woman held captive by a demon, whom Oisin battled again and again for a hundred years, until it was finally defeated. They then went to an island where ancient giants who had grown tired of the world long ago were sleeping until its end, and Niamh and Oisin slept and dreamt with them for a hundred years. Oisin then desired to return to Ireland to see his comrades. Niamh lent him her horse warning him that he must not touch the ground, or he would never return. Back in Ireland, Oisin, still a young man, found his warrior companions dead, and the pagan faith of Ireland displaced by Patrick&#x27;s Christianity. He then saw two men struggling to carry a &quot;sack full of sand&quot;; he bent down to lift it with one hand and hurl it away for them, but his saddle girth broke and he fell to the ground, becoming three hundred years old instantaneously.

==Structure==
The poem is told in three parts, with the verse becoming more complex with each: the lines run four (iambic tetrameter), five (iambic pentameter), and six (anapaestic hexameter) metrical feet respectively. The three &quot;books&quot; begin thus:

For thousands of years, Saysutshun Island was used by the Coast Salish peoples as a seasonal fishing site.

European explorers, including members of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), initially assumed the island was uninhabited. Owing to the abundant fish population, they established a herring industry in the region, constructing salteries and fisheries on the northwestern coast of the island.

Ki’et’sa’kun, a Snuneymuxw man, told the English about coal on the island and they gave him the nickname &quot;Coal Tyee&quot; as a result. Coal mining became the primary industry in Nanaimo in the late nineteenth century. The HBC, aware of the importance of coal, named this island for Newcastle upon Tyne, an English area of coal production.

While mining for coal, the island&#x27;s sandstone was found to be of exceptional quality and was soon quarried for other uses: construction of buildings in cities across Canada and other countries. Many different companies competed for leases of land for access to cut the Newcastle Island stone.

The timber industry also sought this stone to use as pulp-stones, to grind tree fibres into pulp for paper-making. While industrial uses predominated for years, the Canadian Pacific Railway envisioned the island as a tourist and resort destination. After a decrease in popularity with competition from other sites and a decline in train passenger travel, the railroad sold the island to the city of Nanaimo. They eventually sold it to the BC Government, who adapted it as a marine park.

=== Before European contact ===

The Snuneymuxw, the Nanaimo branch of the Coast Salish linguistic group, had two villages located on Saysutshun Island. Saysetsen, located on the east side of the island facing nearby Protection Island near Midden Bay, had easy access to the herring that spawned in the Gap during late winter and early spring. To catch the herring, the Snuneymuxw traditionally used hardwood sticks inlaid with sharp whalebone teeth along one side. By striking these into the water, they could spear ten to twelve fish at a time, and quickly fill their canoes.

They lived at Saysetsen seasonally, from January to April, in order to catch the spawning herring. Later they moved to a seasonal village at Gabriola Island where they would stay until early August. They traversed the Strait of Georgia to the mouth of the Fraser River, where they stayed until the end of August in order to catch spawning sockeye and humpback salmon. Next, they returned to Vancouver Island for the chum salmon run. In January they would begin the cycle again on Saysutshun Island. Clotsun, the other village, had a name meaning Protector.

The Snuneymuxw placed their deceased in trees, where birds and animals would gradually strip the bodies. In the 19th century, there was a popular belief that they had buried their dead in chests in caves on Newcastle Island.

=== Coal industry at Newcastle Island and Nanaimo ===
English officials of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company named the island Newcastle after the discovery of coal here in 1849. It was named for the noted mining town of Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England. The discovery of coal here gave the British a source on the west coast of North America for fuel for their steamships and later railroads. Mining was established at Fort Rupert in 1830, but the quality of coal at Newcastle Island was superior and superseded it.

Native chief Ki’et’sa’kun is credited with telling the English about coal in 1849–1850. He was said to have seen a blacksmith in Fort Victoria using coal in his fire. Ki’et’sa’kun told the man he knew of a site with abundant coal. He was given a bottle of rum and free gun repair if he could bring proof of his claim back to Fort Victoria. In April 1850, approximately fifteen months after he first spoke to the blacksmith, Ki’et’sa’kun returned with a canoe full of coal. Joseph McKay, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company clerk was told and was sent to investigate. This coal proved to be superior to the coal being mined at Fort Rupert.

The British did not establish a mine on Newcastle Island until 1852. When the first mine was sunk there, workers produced 50 tons of coal in one day. In honour of Ki’et’sa’kun&#x27;s find, the English called him &#x27;Coal Tyee&#x27;, meaning Great Coal Chief. McKay Point was named for Joseph McKay.

The two mines on Newcastle Island were called the Fitzwilliam and the Newcastle mines. The Newcastle Mine was open from 1853 to 1856 and was along the Newcastle seam. The Fitzwilliam Mine, located along the Douglas seam, was worked from 1872 to 1882. Both seams ran across the island and to Nanaimo. Coal was also found in a seam that extended to Protection Island.

In the month of September 1852 alone, 480 barrels of coal collected from surface seams were shipped from Newcastle Island to Victoria; that year&#x27;s total production was 200 tons. In the beginning, native Snuneymuxw and European (mostly British) miners from Fort Rupert worked the mines but, by 1854, miners were recruited from England. They lived in Nanaimo with their families and worked 14-day shifts in camps on Newcastle Island.

In 1862, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sold their coalfields, including Newcastle Island, to the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company. This was shortly before workers struck over the continuing poor conditions of the Nanaimo and Newcastle Island mines. There were no routine safety checks of the mines and workers believed that unskilled labour endangered all the men. The new Vancouver company discriminated against First Nations and Chinese people in wages: pay for white persons ranged from $1.75 – $3.75/day (many may have had skilled experience in mining), Natives were paid $1.25 – $1.50/day, and Chinese $1.12/day.

Accidents occurred with fatalities among workers. Worker William Beck died in a mine collapse on 10 June 1874. A gas explosion in the Fitzwilliam Mine on 15 September 1876, resulted in the deaths of three men. This was the first Nanaimo mine to have fatalities from an explosion.

Mine tunnels were constructed beneath the Gap from Newcastle Island to Protection Island, and from Protection Island to Gabriola Island. Miners were said to be able to tell time by distinguishing the sounds of different steamships, whose passage sounded in the mine walls.

===Sandstone industry ===
Sandstone quarrying began on Newcastle Island in 1869 when Joseph Emery from the United States Mint in San Francisco went looking for good quality sandstone for their new building. Finding the stone on Newcastle to be of the desired quality, he signed a five-year lease with the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company to cut stone for the building. It was an appealing white-grey colour; it was easy to remove large blocks because its joints and fractures were few and far between; and it was strong and held up well against weathering because of unusually numerous quartz grains.

The first shipment to San Francisco occurred in the mid-1870s and continued throughout the five years to make the grand total of 8000 tons of sandstone removed from Newcastle Island. This stone was used for the building&#x27;s six columns along the front. They are long and in diameter. The San Francisco Mint has survived two major earthquakes. The San Francisco Mint is no longer in use as an office building and is designated as a National Historic Landmark and museum. 

The U.S. Mint was planned to have eight columns, but two were lost in a shipwreck. A three-masted barque built in Medford, Massachusetts in 1855, the &quot;Zephyr&quot; arrived at Newcastle Island on 31 January 1872, to transport two of the eight sandstone pillars to San Francisco for the new building. It left Departure Bay at 10:00 a.m. on 12 February in stormy weather. The following Monday at 3:30 in the morning, it hit bottom at Mayne Island. Captain Hepson and mate James Stewart drowned but the rest of the crew made it ashore safely. The &quot;Zephyr&quot; is commemorated on Newcastle Island with an exhibit about the ship that includes one of the sandstone columns recovered from the wrecked &quot;Zephyr&quot;.

Many other companies sought leases on the island to cut its sandstone. This was used until 1932 for structures such as the BC Penitentiary, Nanaimo Post Office, Nanaimo Court House, the Bank of Montreal, the British North American Bank of Vancouver, St. John&#x27;s Church in Victoria, and Odd Fellows Hall in Victoria.

==Pulp-stone quarrying==
The immense forestry industry on the west coast processed timber in numerous mills, including some to produce paper and pulp. Pulp stones were used to grind the woodchips into pulp. In 1923, the McDonald Cut-Stone Company was founded to profit from the pulp-stone industry. To cut the stone they would first use plaster of Paris to level the cutting area, then use the cutting machines that would rotate slowly to cut a deep, diameter stone in just 45 minutes. After the circular cut had been made, small charges of gunpowder would be placed in holes drilled at the base of the stone to break it free. A derrick would lift the free stone before the final cuts were made, and a lathe could complete the smoothing process. The finished product would be high with a diameter.

This was a successful business on Newcastle Island until 1932. At that time the company moved operations to Gabriola Island. Later in the 20th century, the industry converted to the use of artificial stones. These could be made relatively cheaply and would last four to five years, in contrast to the three to twenty-month-use period of sandstone.

===Herring salteries===
In the early 20th century, the influence of Asian immigrants, the majority being Japanese, and their salteries off the coast of Nanaimo was already well established. The major buyers for the salted herring and salmon were from Japan, Hong Kong, and China. Herring season went from December to February every year, but in the 1920s, the season was extended to include September, November, and October. The salmon season began in July and went until mid-August, which worked out well for the saltery owners because they could use the same facilities for both herring and salmon seeing as they could only be caught at different times of the year.

In order to catch the herring, the Japanese had a way of fishing called seining. Seining involved the use of two identical sister ships, one strengthened on the port side and the other on the starboard. They would then surround the school of herring with a net and then close it up.

On 12 July 1912, four of the salteries on Newcastle Island burnt down, totalling over $21,000 worth of damage. The salteries were owned by Mr. Oburi, Mr. Mase, Mr. Shinobu, and Mr. Makino, all of whom were issei (first-generation Japanese-Canadians). The salteries were quickly rebuilt, but the cause of the fires was unknown and arson was suspected.

In 1918, T. Matsuyama and the Ode brothers got together and started the Nanaimo Shipyards Limited. Nanaimo Shipyards Limited was a shipbuilding and repair shop located on Newcastle Island. The company gained popularity and was growing rapidly. In 1939, the main shed was and by 1941, the company owned 16 boars and 4.18 acres (17,000 m2) of the island. All this was taken from them in 1941, at the start of World War II, along with Mr. Tanaka&#x27;s and Mr. Kasho&#x27;s salteries, when the Japanese-Canadians were sent to the Interior of British Columbia to be placed in internment camps.

===Peter Kakua the Kanaka===

In the mid-nineteenth century Hawaiian immigrant labourers, known as Kanakas, worked for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the North West Company on a term basis. Once their term was completed they were free to go wherever they pleased. Many returned home to Hawaii (then known as the Sandwich Islands), but others stayed in British Columbia. Peter Kakua was one of the many Hawaiians who married and settled in BC, having children and starting a family.

Kakua started working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1853 and served in Fort Victoria under Governor James Douglas. After he left his position in the HBC, he moved to Nanaimo, There he met and married his wife, Que-en, also known as Mary, who was of aboriginal descent. They had a daughter in 1868.

On 7 December 1868, Kakua pleaded guilty to murder. He confessed that Que-en had decided to leave him and take their daughter, so he went drinking. After returning home the night of 3 December, he found her and her parents, mother Sqush-e-lek and father Shil-at-ti-nord, packing her belongings. He left the house again, but when he returned at two in the morning, he found his father-in-law in bed with Que-en. In a fit of rage, Kakua killed everyone in the house with an axe, including his daughter. Realising what he had done, he went to see his friend Stephany. Kakua said that he needed to escape to the mainland. Stephany was also drunk and did not want to go that far. He helped Kakua row a boat to what is now Kanaka Bay on Newcastle Island.

There he was found and captured on 4 December. He tried to escape custody on the boat ride back to Nanaimo but he was hit by a paddle and recaptured.

Kakua was tried by Joseph Needham, known as &quot;the hanging judge&quot;, on 10 February 1869. The judge concluded the trial that day, saying, &quot;Peter Kakua we find you guilty as charged of four counts of murder and sentence you to be hanged by the neck until dead&quot;. He was hanged on Friday, 10 March 1869, at Gallows Point on Protection Island, across the Gap from Newcastle. His body was buried in an unmarked grave near Kanaka Bay because both the Native people and Europeans rejected his being buried in their sacred areas.

On 4 October 1899, a body was dug up close to Kanaka Bay. It was believed to be that of Peter P. Kakua. He was reburied nearby.

===CPR resort===
The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), owned and operated the British Columbia Coast Steamship Service (BCCSS). Their Princess steamships travelled the inland waters and competed with the Union Steamship Company of British Columbia for business. The Union Steamship Co bought of land on Bowen Island to develop as a recreational day-trio destination for people of Vancouver. As it was a great success, and the BCCSS began to seek property it could develop. They began looking for possible locations on the islands around Nanaimo, such as Taylor Bay on Gabriola Island, but decided on Newcastle Island.

In 1930, the BCCSS bought Newcastle Island from the Western Fuel Corporation of Canada for $30,000. They invested another $100,000 in developing the facilities they wanted. The main attraction was the pavilion. It had a soda fountain and a spring-loaded dance floor. They also built picnic shelters and a bathhouse. They introduced muskrats and beavers to the island for the tourists to watch. By spending $50,000, they built a dock in Mark Bay for their &quot;floating hotels&quot;.

The retired steamship, the &quot;Charmer&quot;, made its 3000th voyage in 1902. It was used as an automobile ferry from Vancouver to Nanaimo until the &quot;Princess Elaine&quot; took over. It was the first ship used on Newcastle Island as a hotel, and the first ship in British Columbia to have electric lights. People could stay there for a week for $7.50. Other boats, such as the &quot;Princess Elizabeth&quot;, the &quot;Princess Joan&quot;, and the &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; transported people there and back at a cost of $1.35 round trip. The &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; could make the Vancouver–Nanaimo voyage in 2 hours 19 minutes, which is not much slower than the current BC Ferries&#x27; runs. The &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; was also eventually used as a floating hotel.

The CPR resort on Newcastle Island was a success. It officially opened on Saturday, 20 July 1931. In that first season, some 14,323 visitors went to the island, spending a total of $21,762.35. It was not uncommon to see 1500 picnickers on the island at one time. At the start of World War II, the Princess ships were reassigned for military use and tourists could no longer visit the island.

The Newcastle Island pavilion is the only pavilion of its kind that has survived from the island resort era between the two world wars. It was restored in 1984..

===Nanaimo Ownership and Selling to the Provincial Government===
When the CPR decided that the resort was not making enough money, they asked the City of Nanaimo whether or not they would like to buy the island. The deal went through in 1955 and the island was sold for $150,000. The City of Nanaimo had a hard time maintaining the island and they fell into debt. On 17 December 1959, a referendum was put to the people about selling the island to the Provincial Department of Recreation and Conservation for development as a Provincial Park. Voters responded with 86.8% &#x27;yes&#x27; votes.

The B.C. government agreed to purchase the property with these six conditions:
#The island would become a marine park and, if it or any part of it stopped being a marine park, it shall &quot;revert to the Corporation of the City of Nanaimo&quot;.
#The government would take possession of the island and its facilities, and the responsibilities that go with the possession as of 1 April 1960.
#That access by bridge would be provided as soon as possible. Until that time access would be maintained and be equal to or greater than that provided by the City of Nanaimo in 1959.
#The government must prepare a master plan for Newcastle Island&#x27;s development. The City of Nanaimo would get to see this master plan and approve it before it was carried out.
#Until the master plan is finished, the facilities must be maintained and operated at a level that is equal to or greater than that provided by the City of Nanaimo.
#That the development of Newcastle Island into a marine park would happen as soon as possible and that preliminary development would begin in 1960.

These conditions were agreed upon on 30 October 1959. The park would be sold to the government for $1 plus the mortgage on 1 April 1960.

Development began that year to make Newcastle Island into a class A provincial park. Earle C. Westwood, Minister of Recreation and Conservation, said that Newcastle Island would be the &quot;gem of Vancouver Island&quot; and the &quot;Stanley Park of Vancouver Island&quot;. Although the government did try to fulfill all their agreements, correspondence between the Minister of Recreation and Conservation and Nanaimo Alderman R. A. Brookbank show that the master plan, outlined in both points 4 and 5, had not been created. Later, after the park had been assigned to the Department of Lands, Parks and Housing rather than the Ministry of Recreation and Conservation, Brookbank continued to send letters of inquiry about the master place to the Deputy Minister Chris Grey. He responded that the plan would take a year to develop, but that had been the answer 20 years before. It is unknown whether a master plan was ever devised by the BC government.

In May 1983, the City of Nanaimo Ad Hoc Committee made their own plan. Their goals were &quot;to provide the people of BC and particularly the Nanaimo area, a range of year-round recreation, historic, and natural history opportunities&quot; and &quot;to protect and develop the ability of the natural and cultural resources of the park to provide such opportunities in perpetuity.&quot; Many of this committee&#x27;s ideas and suggestions were carried out, but some were not. There has never been sport fishing on Mallard Lake and there has never been a designated volleyball area. The committee also addressed the issue of the bridge. They felt that a bridge would not meet the park&#x27;s objectives and would generally be a bad idea.

The park has been co-managed through a tri-partite agreement between BC Parks, the City of Nanaimo, and Snuneymuxw First Nation since 2003.

In 2021, the park was renamed as Saysutshun (Newcastle Island Marine) Park to acknowledge its first inhabitants, the Snuneymuxw people.

==Current uses==
Currently, no one except park authorities live on Newcastle Island. The original First Nations peoples who inhabited the island left in 1849 when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company started opening up coal mines. The park has become an extremely popular tourist spot that now caters to hikers, campers, bird watchers, cyclists, and kayakers alike.

Walk-in campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Mooring buoys are available (no reservations), but many boating visitors simply anchor in the area between Newcastle Island and Protection Island. An exceptionally lucky visitor might find space at the dock to tie up. A fee is charged for camping, mooring to a buoy, and overnight use of the dock.

==Transportation==
Newcastle Island (Saysutshun) is accessible only by water. A foot-passenger ferry crosses in ten minutes from downtown Nanaimo at Maffeo Sutton Park to the southern end of the island. It is also a popular destination for kayakers and other boaters.
In the summer at low tide, one can walk across the narrow strait separating it from Protection Island.

==Mallard Lake==
Since Newcastle Island was originally a resourced-based commercial island with a population of people living there, they needed a water supply. Mallard Lake, near the centre of the island, is an artificial lake created to serve as a reservoir. It now is the center of a wildlife sanctuary. Bird watching is one of the most popular activities on the island, and Mallard Lake is a prime place for that.

<text>Christopher Thomas Allen (14 July 1952 – 25 March 2024), known professionally as Chris Cross, was an English musician, best known as the bass guitarist in the new wave band Ultravox. After starting his music career with Stoned Rose, a band in Preston, Lancashire, he was one of the founding members of the band Tiger Lily in April 1974, before the band was renamed Ultravox! over two years later. The band&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Vienna&quot;, was released in 1981.

Cross left Ultravox in 1989, several years after the band&#x27;s studio album &quot;U-Vox&quot; was released in 1986. He rejoined the band after their revival in 2009 with a tour, and Ultravox released &quot;Brilliant&quot;, another studio album, three years later. Cross died in 2024 at the age of 71.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Christopher Thomas Allen was born in Tottenham, London, England, on 14 July 1952. He went to Belmont Secondary Modern School and William Forster Comprehensive. He began his music career playing in different bands, with his major early influences being Small Faces, Desmond Dekker and The Crazy World of Arthur Brown.

Later he joined Stoned Rose, in Preston, Lancashire, but also decided to go to college to study psychology, a longstanding interest.

=== Tiger Lily and Ultravox ===
After his time at college he returned to London to apply at the Royal College of Art. Meanwhile, after answering an advertisement, the band Tiger Lily was created in 1974, with the founding members consisting of Cross (then identified as Chris St. John), singer Dennis Leigh, guitarist Stevie Shears, drummer Warren Cann, and violinist/keyboardist Billy Currie. After playing gigs from 1974 to 1976, in the latter year the band renamed themselves Ultravox! and signed to Island Records.

In 1979, after three commercially unsuccessful but influential albums – &quot;Ultravox!&quot; (1977), &quot;Ha!-Ha!-Ha!&quot; (1977) and &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; (1978) – original vocalist John Foxx and guitarist Robin Simon, who had replaced Stevie Shears a year before, left Ultravox.

Midge Ure joined Ultravox in 1979, and the band released their commercially successful &quot;Vienna&quot; album a year later. By that time Cross and Ure were close friends; they together directed music videos such as Bananarama&#x27;s &quot;Shy Boy&quot; and &quot;The Telephone Always Rings&quot; by Fun Boy Three. The band then produced another few successful albums: &quot;Rage in Eden&quot; (1981), &quot;Quartet&quot; (1982), &quot;Monument&quot; (1983) and &quot;Lament&quot; (1984). After &quot;U-Vox&quot;, a studio album released in 1986, Cross left Ultravox in 1989 and pursued a career as a psychotherapist. Before Cross&#x27;s departure, Ure had also left the band to perform as a solo artist before rejoining, but Cross noted the band &quot;fell apart&quot; after Ure rejoined, also stating &quot;it was like everyone lost interest&quot;.

=== Ultravox revival ===

In April 2009, Ultravox embarked on the &quot;Return to Eden&quot; tour, which included two festivals and a &quot;Best of Ultravox&quot; CD/DVD being released by EMI.

The 2012 album release, &quot;Brilliant&quot;, included Cross as co-writer with Billy Currie and Midge Ure on all tracks. The album was promoted with a UK theatre tour and a series of European dates. Ultravox made their final performance in 2013, at The O2 in London.

== Death ==
Cross died on 25 March 2024, at the age of 71. His death was announced on 1 April by Ultravox member Midge Ure, who did not specify Cross&#x27;s cause of death.

<doc id="312212" wikidata="Q3213474" url="?curid=312212" title="Trigram">
<text>Trigrams are a special case of the &quot;n&quot;-gram, where &quot;n&quot; is 3. They are often used in natural language processing for performing statistical analysis of texts and in cryptography for control and use of ciphers and codes. See results of analysis of &quot;Letter Frequencies in the English Language&quot;.

==Frequency==
Context is very important, varying analysis rankings and percentages are easily derived by drawing from different sample sizes, different authors; or different document types: poetry, science-fiction, technology documentation; and writing levels: stories for children versus adults, military orders, and recipes.

Typical cryptanalytic frequency analysis finds that the 16 most common character-level trigrams in English are:

Because encrypted messages sent by telegraph often omit punctuation and spaces, cryptographic frequency analysis of such messages includes trigrams that straddle word boundaries. This causes trigrams such as &quot;edt&quot; to occur frequently, even though it may never occur in any one word of those messages.

==Examples==
The sentence &quot;the quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog&quot; has the following word-level trigrams:

 the quick red
 quick red fox
 red fox jumps
 fox jumps over
 jumps over the
 over the lazy
 the lazy brown
 lazy brown dog

And the word-level trigram &quot;the quick red&quot; has the following character-level trigrams (where an underscore &quot;_&quot; marks a space):
 the
 he_
 e_q
 _qu
 qui
 uic
 ick
 ck_
 k_r
 _re

<doc id="312222" wikidata="Q420716" url="?curid=312222" title="Indigenous Australian art">
<text>Indigenous Australian art includes art made by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, including collaborations with others. It includes works in a wide range of media including painting on leaves, bark painting, wood carving, rock carving, watercolour painting, sculpting, ceremonial clothing and sandpainting. The traditional visual symbols vary widely among the differing peoples&#x27; traditions, despite the common mistaken perception that dot painting is representative of all Aboriginal art.
==Traditional Aboriginal art==
There are many types of and methods used in making Aboriginal art, including rock painting, dot painting, rock engravings, bark painting, carvings, sculptures, weaving, and string art. Australian Aboriginal art is the oldest unbroken tradition of art in the world.

===Stone art===
Rock art, including painting and engraving or carving (petroglyphs), can be found at sites throughout Australia. Examples of rock art have been found that are believed to depict extinct megafauna such as &quot;Genyornis&quot; and &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; in the Pleistocene era as well as more recent historical events such as the arrival of European ships.

The oldest examples of rock art, in Western Australia&#x27;s Pilbara region and the Olary district of South Australia, are estimated to be up to around 40,000 years old. The oldest firmly dated evidence of rock art painting in Australia is a charcoal drawing on a small rock fragment found during the excavation of the Narwala Gabarnmang rock shelter in south-western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. Dated at 28,000 years, it is one of the oldest known pieces of rock art on Earth with a confirmed date. It is thought this decorated fragment may have once formed part of a larger ceiling artwork, however, the shape of the original motif is unknown. The oldest reliably dated unambiguous, in-situ rock art motif in Australia is a large painting of a macropod from a rock shelter in Western Australia&#x27;s Kimberley region, radiometrically dated in a February 2021 study at approximately 17,300 years old.

Gwion Gwion rock art (the &quot;Bradshaw rock paintings&quot;, also referred to as Giro Giro&quot;), initially named after Joseph Bradshaw, who first reported them in 1891, consists of a series of rock paintings on caves in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. A 2020 study puts this art at about 12,000 years old.

The Maliwawa Figures were documented in a study led by Paul Taçon and published in &quot;Australian Archaeology&quot; in September 2020. The art includes 572 images across 87 sites in northwest Arnhem Land, from Awunbarna (Mount Borradaile) area across to the Wellington Range. They are estimated to have been drawn between 6,000 and 9,400 years ago. The find is described as very rare, not only in style, but in their depiction of bilbies (not known historically in Arnhem Land) and the first known depiction of a dugong. The art, all paintings in red to mulberry colour apart from one drawing, and in a naturalistic style, had not been described in the literature before this study. They are large, and depict relationships between people and animals, a rare theme in rock art. Bilbies, thylacines and dugong have been extinct in Arnhem land for millennia. The art was first seen by the 2008-2009 researchers, but were only studied in field research lasting from 2016 to 2018. The figures were named by Ronald Lamilami, a senior traditional owner. According to Tacon, &quot;The Maliwawa back-to-back figures are the oldest known for western Arnhem Land and it appears this painting convention began with the Maliwawa style. It continues to the present with bark paintings and paintings on paper&quot;. Taçon draws comparisons between the Maliwawa Figures and George Chaloupka&#x27;s Dynamic Figures style, where the subject matter consists of about 89 percent humans, compared with 42% of the Maliwawa Figures. There is, however, much complexity and debate regarding the classification of rock art style in Arnhem Land.

Other painted rock art sites include Laura, Queensland, Ubirr, in the Kakadu National Park, Uluru, and Carnarvon Gorge.

Rock engraving, or petroglyphs, are created by methods which vary depending on the type of rock being used and other factors. There are several different types of rock art across Australia, the most famous of which is Murujuga in Western Australia, the Sydney rock engravings around Sydney in New South Wales, and the Panaramitee rock art in Central Australia. The Toowoomba engravings, depicting carved animals and humans, have their own peculiar style not found elsewhere in Australia.

The rock engravings at Murujuga are said to be the world&#x27;s largest collection of petroglyphs and includes images of extinct animals such as the thylacine. Activity prior to the last ice age until colonisation is recorded.
The first European discovery of aboriginal rock paintings took place on 14 January 1803. During a surveying expedition along the shores and islands of the Gulf of Carpentaria, British navigator and explorer Matthew Flinders made landfall on Chasm Island.

Within the island&#x27;s rock shelters, Flinders discovered an array of painted and stenciled patterns. To record these images, he enlisted the ship&#x27;s artist, William Westall. Westall&#x27;s two watercolour sketches are the earliest known documentation of Australian rock art. 

=== Stone arrangements ===
Aboriginal stone arrangements are a form of rock art constructed by Aboriginal Australians. Typically they consist of stones, each of which may be about 30 cm in size, laid out in a pattern extending over several metres or tens of metres. Each stone is well-embedded into the soil, and many have &quot;trigger-stones&quot; to support them. Particularly fine examples are in the state of Victoria, where some examples have very large stones. For example, the stone arrangement at Wurdi Youang consists of about 100 stones arranged in an egg-shaped oval about across. The appearance of the site is similar to that of the megalithic stone circles found throughout Britain (although the function and culture are presumably completely different). Although its association with Aboriginal Australians is well-authenticated and beyond doubt, the purpose is unclear, although it may have a connection with initiation rites. It has also been suggested that the site may have been used for astronomical purposes. 
Smaller stone arrangements are found throughout Australia, such as those near Yirrkala, which depict accurate images of the praus used by Macassan Trepang fishermen and spear throwers.

=== Wood carvings ===
Wood carving has always been an essential part of Aboriginal culture, requiring wood, sharp stone to carve, wire and fire. The wire and fire were used to create patterns on the object by heating the wire with the fire and placing it on the wood carving.

Wood carvings such as those by Central Australian artist Erlikilyika shaped like animals, were sometimes traded to Europeans for goods.
The reason Aboriginal people made wood carvings was to help tell their Dreaming stories and pass on their group&#x27;s lore and essential information about their country and customs. They were also used in ceremonies, such as the &quot;ilma&quot;.

Aboriginal people from the Tiwi Islands traditionally carved &quot;pukumani&quot; grave posts, and since the 1960s have been carving and painting iron wood figures.

===Bark painting===
Bark painting, where painting is done using ochres on the dried bark stripped off trees, is an old tradition. The earliest European find was in a shelter in Tasmania around 1800, and other painted bark shelters were found in Victoria and NSW. These were drawn with charcoal, and then painted or scratched onto bark which had been blackened by smoke. Painted bark baskets were used in death rituals on Melville and Bathurst Islands, and bark coffins and belts were painted in northeast Arnhem Land. BArk painting has continued into contemporary times. 
Styles in bark painting in Northern Australia, especially in Arnhem Land, include cross-hatching, or rarrk, and x-ray style.

===Baskets and weaving===

Baskets, sometimes coiled baskets, were created by twisting bark, palm-leaf, and feathers; some of the baskets were plain and some were created with feather pendants or feathers woven in the frame of the basket. The artists used mineral and plant dyes to colour the palm-leaves and bark of the hibiscus. These string bags and baskets were used in ceremonies for religious and ritual needs; the baskets might have been also used for carry things back to the village.

Basket weaving has been traditionally practised by the women of many Aboriginal Australian peoples across the continent for centuries.

===Jewellery===

Aboriginal people created shell pendants which were considered high value and often used for trading goods. These shells were attached to string, which was handmade from human hair and sometimes covered with a type of grease and red ochre. This jewellery would sometimes be hung around a man&#x27;s neck or waist for use during ceremonies.

=== Kalti paarti ===
Kalti paarti carving is a traditional art form made by carving emu eggs. It is not as old as some other techniques, having originated in the nineteenth century.

===Symbols and sacred aspects===
Certain symbols within the Aboriginal modern art movement retain the same meaning across regions, although the meaning of the symbols may change within the context of a painting. When viewed in monochrome other symbols can look similar, such as the circles within circles, sometimes depicted on their own, sparsely, or in clustered groups.

Many paintings by Aboriginal artists, such as those that represent a Dreaming story, are shown from an aerial perspective. The narrative follows the lie of the land, as created by ancestral beings in their journey or during creation. The modern-day rendition is a reinterpretation of songs, ceremonies, rock art, body art, and ceremonies (such as awelye) that was the norm for many thousands of years.

Whatever the meaning, interpretations of the symbols should be made in context of the entire painting, the region from which the artist originates, the story behind the painting, and the style of the painting.
Some natural sites are sacred to Aboriginal people, and often the location where seasonal rituals were performed. During these rituals the Aboriginal people created art such as feather and fibre objects, they painted and created rock engravings, and also painted on bark of  the Eucalyptus tetrodonta trees. While stories differed among the clans, language groups, and wider groups, the Dreaming (or &quot;Jukurrpa&quot;) is common to all Aboriginal peoples. As part of these beliefs, during ancient times mythic Aboriginal ancestor spirits were the creators of the land and sky, and eventually became a part of it. The Aboriginal peoples&#x27; spiritual beliefs underpin their laws, art forms, and ceremonies. Traditional Aboriginal art almost always has a mythological undertone relating to the Dreaming.

Wenten Rubuntja, an Indigenous landscape artist, says it is hard to find any art that is devoid of spiritual meaning:

Story-telling and totem representation feature prominently in all forms of Aboriginal artwork. Additionally, the female form, particularly the female womb in X-ray style, features prominently in some famous sites in Arnhem Land. X-ray styles date back all the way to 2000–1000 BCE. It is an Indigenous technique where the artist creates conceptualised X-ray, transparent , images. The &quot;mimi&quot;, spirits who taught the art of painting to the Aboriginal people, and ancestors are &quot;released&quot; through these types of artwork.

===Traditional cultural expressions===
Traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions are both types of indigenous knowledge, according to the definitions and terminology used in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and by the World Intellectual Property Organization&#x27;s (WIPO) Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore. &quot;Traditional cultural expressions&quot; is used by WIPO to refer to &quot;any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance&quot;.

Leading international authority on Indigenous cultural and intellectual property, Australian lawyer Terri Janke, says that within Australian Indigenous communities, &quot;the use of the word &#x27;traditional&#x27; tends not to be preferred as it implies that Indigenous culture is locked in time&quot;.

===Vandalism and other threats===
Many culturally as well as historically significant sites of Aboriginal rock paintings have degraded over time, as well as being desecrated and destroyed by encroachment of early settlers and modern-day visitors (including erosion caused by excessive touching); clearing for development of industries; and wanton vandalism and graffiti in criminal acts of destruction. Some recent examples are cited below.

In 2022, in an event which made news around the world, unique 30,000-year-old artwork at Koonalda Cave on the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia, which had been heritage-listed in 2014 because of its rarity, was vandalised and much of the artwork rendered unrecoverable. The site was of great significance to the Mirning people.

In 2023, three large panels of rock art were removed from Murujuga in Western Australia, in order to build a new fertiliser factory. Several archaeologists have urged others to join Aboriginal voices in protesting against this type of damage to cultural sites.

In late 2023 and early 2024, the Bulgandry Aboriginal art site in the Brisbane Water National Park, an ancient Aboriginal art site in New South Wales, was vandalised twice within a few months. NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service closed off one walking track to the site, installed signs, and installed surveillance cameras, in a bid to prevent further damage.

==Traditional Torres Strait Islander art==

Mythology and culture, deeply influenced by the ocean and the natural life around the islands, have always informed traditional artforms. Featured strongly are turtles, fish, dugongs, sharks, seabirds and saltwater crocodiles, which are considered totemic beings.

Elaborate headdresses or &quot;dhari&quot; (also spelt &quot;dari&quot;), as featured on the Torres Strait Islander flag, are created for the purposes of ceremonial dances. The dari was historically worn by Torres Strait warriors in battle. It is seen as a powerful symbol of the Torres Strait Islander people, today representing peace and harmony. World-renowned artist Ken Thaiday Snr has created elaborate dharis using modern materials in his contemporary artwork.

Torres Strait Islander people are the only culture in the world to make turtleshell masks, known as &quot;krar&quot; (turtleshell) in the Western Islands and &quot;le-op&quot; (human face) in the Eastern Islands.

Prominent among the artforms is &quot;wame&quot; (alt. &quot;wameya&quot;), many different string figures.

The Islands have a long tradition of woodcarving, creating masks and drums, and carving decorative features on these and other items for ceremonial use. From the 1970s, young artists were beginning their studies at around the same time that a significant re-connection to traditional myths and legends was happening. Margaret Lawrie&#x27;s publications, &quot;Myths and Legends of the Torres Strait&quot; (1970) and &quot;Tales from the Torres Strait&quot; (1972), reviving stories which had all but been forgotten, influenced the artists greatly. While some of these stories had been written down by Haddon after his 1898 expedition to the Torres Strait, many had subsequently fallen out of use or been forgotten.

==Differing traditions==
Traditional symbols vary widely among different groups of Aboriginal people, which are usually related to language groups. Since dot painting became popular from the 1970s, and was further developed in contemporary Indigenous art, it has become a common perception that all Aboriginal art uses dot symbolism. New South Wales artist Shane Smithers has pointed out that roadside representations of Aboriginal art in his country do not represent his people&#x27;s (Dharug and Dharawal) art and symbolic traditions, which uses lines rather than dots, which are a visual language from the Western Desert region.

== Contemporary Aboriginal art ==

=== Modern Aboriginal artists ===
In the 1930s, artists Rex Battarbee and John Gardner introduced watercolour painting to Albert Namatjira, an Indigenous man at Hermannsberg Mission, south-west of Alice Springs. His landscape paintings, first created in 1936 and exhibited in Australian cities in 1938, were immediately successful, and he became the first Indigenous Australian watercolourist as well as the first to successfully exhibit and sell his works to the non-Indigenous community. Namatjira&#x27;s style of work was adopted by other Indigenous artists in the region beginning with his close male relatives, and they became known as the Hermannsburg School or as the Arrernte Watercolourists.

In 1988 the &quot;Aboriginal Memorial&quot; was unveiled at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra made from 200 hollow log coffins, which are similar to the type used for mortuary ceremonies in Arnhem Land. It was made for the bicentenary of Australia&#x27;s colonisation, and is in remembrance of Aboriginal people who had died protecting their land during conflict with settlers. It was created by 43 artists from Ramingining and communities nearby.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the work of Emily Kngwarreye, from the Utopia community north east of Alice Springs, became very popular. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as her niece Kathleen Petyarre, Angelina Pwerle, Minnie Pwerle, Dorothy Napangardi, and many others.

===Papunya Tula and dot painting===

In 1971–1972, art teacher Geoffrey Bardon encouraged Aboriginal people in Papunya, north west of Alice Springs to put their Dreamings onto canvas. These stories had previously been drawn on the desert sand, and were now given a more permanent form. The dots were used to cover secret-sacred ceremonies. Originally, the Tula artists succeeded in forming their own company with an Aboriginal Name, Papunya Tula Artists Pty Ltd. The Papunya Collection at the National Museum of Australia contains over 200 artefacts and paintings, including examples of 1970s dot paintings.

===Issues===

There have been cases of some exploitative dealers who have sought to profit from the success of the Aboriginal art movements, particularly after art sales boomed between 1994 and 1997. In August 2006, following concerns raised about unethical practices in the Indigenous art sector, the Australian Senate initiated an inquiry into issues in the sector, with its report published in 2007.

===Aboriginal art movements and cooperatives ===

Australian Indigenous art movements and cooperatives have been central to the emergence of Indigenous Australian art. Whereas many western artists pursue formal training and work as individuals, most contemporary Indigenous art is created in community groups and art centres. One of the main reasons the Yuendumu movement, based at Warlukurlangu Artists was established, and later flourished, was due to the feeling of exploitation amongst artists.

==Contemporary Torres Strait Islander art==

In the 1990s a group of younger Torres Strait Island artists, including the award-winning Dennis Nona (b. 1973), started translating traditional skills into the more portable forms of printmaking, linocut, and etching, as well as larger scale bronze sculptures. Other outstanding artists include Billy Missi (1970–2012), known for his decorated black and white linocuts of the local vegetation and eco-systems, and Alick Tipoti (b.1975). These and other Torres Strait artists have greatly expanded the forms of Indigenous art within Australia, bringing superb Melanesian carving skills as well as new stories and subject matter. The College of Technical and Further Education on Thursday Island was a starting point for young Islanders to pursue studies in art. Many went on to further art studies, especially in printmaking, initially in Cairns, Queensland and later at the Australian National University in what is now the School of Art and Design. Other artists such as Laurie Nona, Brian Robinson, David Bosun, Glen Mackie, Joemen Nona, Daniel O&#x27;Shane, and Tommy Pau are known for their printmaking work.

==In international museums==
Australian Indigenous art has been much studied in recent years and has gained much international recognition. The Rebecca Hossack gallery in London has been credited with &quot;almost single-handedly&quot; introducing Australian Indigenous art to Britain and Europe since its opening in 1988. 

The Musée du Quai Branly in Paris, France, which opened in 2006, has an &quot;Oceania&quot; collection. It also commissioned paintings on the roof and ceilings of its building on the rue de l&#x27;Université, housing the museum&#x27;s workshops and library, by four female and four male contemporary Aboriginal artists: Lena Nyadbi, Judy Watson, Gulumbu Yunupingu, Ningura Napurrula; John Mawurndjul, Paddy Nyunkuny Bedford, Michael Riley, and Yannima Tommy Watson.

Museums dedicated solely to Indigenous art outside of Australia include the following:
*The Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia, which opened in its current location in 1999, exhibits solely Australian Aboriginal art, and regularly mounts exhibitions.
*The La Grange museum for Australian Aboriginal art in the village of Môtiers, near Neuchâtel, Switzerland, is one of the few museums in Europe that dedicates itself entirely the art and culture of Aboriginal Australian peoples. During seasonal exhibitions, works of art by internationally renowned artists are shown. It opened in 2008.
*The , in Utrecht, Netherlands, was dedicated to contemporary Australian Aboriginal art, but closed in 2017.

<text>House Party is a 1990 American comedy film directed by Reginald Hudlin. It stars Christopher &quot;Kid&quot; Reid and Christopher &quot;Play&quot; Martin of the hip hop duo Kid &#x27;n Play in their film debut, Paul Anthony, Bow-Legged Lou, and B-Fine of Full Force, and Robin Harris (who died of a heart attack nine days after the film was released, making &quot;House Party&quot; his penultimate acting role).

The film was written and directed by Reginald Hudlin, based on his award-winning Harvard University student film. The film grossed over $26 million in its run at the box office with its widest release being 700 theaters. Upon its initial release, the film garnered critical acclaim and has since become a cult classic.

The lead roles were originally written for DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince.

In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
At the very beginning of the movie, kids dance inside of a house, and the noise is so loud that it blows the roof off.

In his high-school cafeteria, Peter, also known as &quot;Play,&quot; announces that he will be having a party at his house that night, as his parents are on vacation. The reluctant student Bilal is to be the DJ. Their friend Christopher &quot;Kid&quot; Robinson Jr. gets involved in an altercation with school bully Stab and his brothers, Pee-Wee and Zilla. At home, Kid tries to convince his father Christopher &quot;Pop&quot; Robinson Sr. to let him go to the party. Pop relents at first, but after getting a call from school about Kid&#x27;s fight with Stab, Pop changes his mind and grounds his son for his actions.

Rather than miss the party of the year, Kid sneaks out while Pop is sleeping. However, the door closing behind Kid awakens Pop. On his way to the party, Kid is stopped by the neighborhood police and runs into Stab and his brothers, jumps over a fence where a fat man named Roughouse is having sex. Kid, along with Stab, Zilla, and Pee-Wee, are shot at by Roughouse. Kid ducks into a nearby Alpha Delta Sigma reunion to escape them.

Crashing the reunion, Kid has the DJ scratch and mix a few of his old doo wop records so that he can liven the party with a rap, until Stab and the others arrive. Trying to escape, Kid accidentally knocks down an older man. Kid and the bullies are caught by the neighborhood police, who humiliate the teenagers before letting them go. Kid&#x27;s father is stopped and harassed by the police while trying to find him.

The party is in full swing when Kid arrives. During the party, Chill bumps the DJ table, which angers Bilal and other guests, and it nearly results in a fight between the two. Kid and Play get into a dance contest with attractive girls Sydney and Sharane (originally it was Kid and Groove against Sydney and Sharane, but after Groove gets drunk and passes out, Play takes his place), then have a freestyle battle. Stab and his friends attempt to crash the party but are arrested a second time for attempting to burn the house down. The policemen take delight in the prospect of beating them up. Eventually, Pop reaches the party. After failing to find him, Pop vows to wait for Kid at home.

Play stops the party after his bathroom toilet is broken. Although Kid and Sydney have eyes for each other, Sharane decides to flirt with Kid openly, much to Sydney&#x27;s disgust. Soon, the three leave the party, but when Kid tries to make advances on Sharane, she rebuffs him. Kid walks Sydney back home, and, after some argument, the pair calm down.

Sydney allows Kid to sneak into her house. The two are about to have sex there when she stops him, wanting to know if she is simply his second choice. Kid admits that Sydney was his first choice all along. However, they do not do anything after realizing that Kid&#x27;s only condom is too old to be used. When Sydney&#x27;s parents come home – now revealed as one of the couples at the high-school reunion, including the man Kid ran into – Sydney helps Kid sneak out of the house.

He manages to get out of another scrape with Stab and his brothers, and they all end up in a jail cell. Kid entertains the rest of the men in the cell by rapping, distracting them long enough for Play, Sharane, Bilal, and Sydney to arrive and bail him out. Later, the five friends say their good nights. Kid and Sydney share a passionate kiss. After Play and Bilal drop him off, Kid sneaks in the house and gets undressed. As he is about to get into bed, he looks up to find Pop holding a belt as he prepares to spank him. As the credits roll, Pop is heard hitting Kid with the belt.

During the credit roll, the roof that was blown off earlier lands on top of the police officers.

=== Soundtrack ===

A soundtrack containing hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on March 9, 1990, by Motown Records. It peaked at 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 20 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 1990, where it won the Cinematography Award for Peter Deming and a Filmmakers Trophy for Reginald Hudlin.

On March 9, 1990, the film opened in 520 theaters and grossed $4,611,024. It became a sleeper hit, making over $26 million on a $2.5 million budget.

== Reception ==
&quot;House Party&quot; was met with critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 94% approval rating based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;House Party&quot; is a light, entertaining teen comedy with an infectious energy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three out of four stars and commended its &quot;energy and exuberance&quot;. He called the film &quot;wall-to-wall with exuberant song and dance&quot; and stated, &quot;the musical is a canvas used by the director, Reginald Hudlin, to show us black teenagers with a freshness and originality that&#x27;s rare in modern movies&quot;.

The film received seven nominations at the 1991 Independent Spirit Awards. Film director Reginald Hudlin was nominated for Best Director), Christopher &quot;Kid&quot; Reid was nominated for Best Male Lead), Tisha Campbell and A.J. Johnson were both nominated for Best Supporting Female), Robin Harris was nominated for Best Supporting Male), and the film&#x27;s cinematographer Peter Deming was nominated for the Best Cinematography. The film was also nominated for Best First Feature.

== Sequels ==
The film was a popular success, and two sequels were made: &quot;House Party 2&quot; in 1991, and &quot;House Party 3&quot; in 1994. &quot;House Party 2&quot; features Lawrence and Campbell reprising their roles from the first film. The two began starring in the TV sitcom &quot;Martin&quot; the following year. &quot;House Party 3&quot; features hip hop/R&amp;B groups TLC and Immature in supporting roles. In 2001, Immature, now going by IMx, starred in a direct-to-video sequel, &quot;House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute&quot;, which does not feature any of the original cast from the other three films.

A fifth installment and direct follow-up to the third film, titled &quot;House Party: Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was filmed in 2012 with Tequan Richmond, Zac Goodman, Tristin Mays, Alex McGregor, Rolonda Watts and Gary Anthony Williams. The film was a direct to DVD release in 2013, and marked the return of Kid &#x27;n Play to the series.

In 2018, it was announced that basketball star LeBron James, along with his SpringHill Entertainment partner Maverick Carter would be producing a new &quot;House Party&quot; film with Stephen Glover and Jamal Olori writing the screenplay. &quot;This is definitely not a reboot. It’s an entirely new look for a classic movie. Everyone I grew up with loved &quot;House Party&quot;. To partner with this creative team to bring a new &quot;House Party&quot; to a new generation is unbelievable. Listen, it&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s an honor when I got the opportunity to produce it, reboot the whole movie, man, I had so much fun as a kid watching that movie,&quot; James said. &quot;We’re trying out some ideas for musicians to be cast in and to be a part of the project,&quot; Carter said.

Los Angeles filmmaker Calmatic, known for directing &quot;Old Town Road&quot;, was tapped to direct in 2019. In April 2021, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. and Tosin Cole were cast in the lead roles. It was SpringHill&#x27;s last feature film. On July 28, 2021, Jacob Latimore was cast to replace Lendeborg, who dropped out of the film due to his mental well-being. Kid and Play both made cameo appearances in the 2023 film, as did producer James.

In 2022, the original film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>In theoretical physics, a chiral anomaly is the anomalous nonconservation of a chiral current. In everyday terms, it is equivalent to a sealed box that contained equal numbers of left and right-handed bolts, but when opened was found to have more left than right, or vice versa.

Such events are expected to be prohibited according to classical conservation laws, but it is known there must be ways they can be broken, because we have evidence of charge–parity non-conservation (&quot;CP violation&quot;). It is possible that other imbalances have been caused by breaking of a &quot;chiral law&quot; of this kind. Many physicists suspect that the fact that the observable universe contains more matter than antimatter is caused by a chiral anomaly. Research into chiral symmetry breaking laws is a major endeavor in particle physics research at this time.

==Informal introduction==

The chiral anomaly originally referred to the anomalous decay rate of the neutral pion, as computed in the current algebra of the chiral model. These calculations suggested that the decay of the pion was suppressed, clearly contradicting experimental results. The nature of the anomalous calculations was first explained in 1969 by Stephen L. Adler and John Stewart Bell &amp; Roman Jackiw. This is now termed the Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly of quantum electrodynamics. This is a symmetry of classical electrodynamics that is violated by quantum corrections.

The Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly arises in the following way. If one considers the classical (non-quantized) theory of electromagnetism coupled to massless fermions (electrically charged Dirac spinors solving the Dirac equation), one expects to have not just one but two conserved currents: the ordinary electrical current (the vector current), described by the Dirac field formula_1 as well as an axial current formula_2 When moving from the classical theory to the quantum theory, one may compute the quantum corrections to these currents; to first order, these are the one-loop Feynman diagrams. These are famously divergent, and require a regularization to be applied, to obtain the renormalized amplitudes. In order for the renormalization to be meaningful, coherent and consistent, the regularized diagrams must obey the same symmetries as the zero-loop (classical) amplitudes. This is the case for the vector current, but not the axial current: it cannot be regularized in such a way as to preserve the axial symmetry. The axial symmetry of classical electrodynamics is broken by quantum corrections. Formally, the Ward–Takahashi identities of the quantum theory follow from the gauge symmetry of the electromagnetic field; the corresponding identities for the axial current are broken.

At the time that the Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly was being explored in physics, there were related developments in differential geometry that appeared to involve the same kinds of expressions. These were not in any way related to quantum corrections of any sort, but rather were the exploration of the global structure of fiber bundles, and specifically, of the Dirac operators on spin structures having curvature forms resembling that of the electromagnetic tensor, both in four and three dimensions (the Chern–Simons theory). After considerable back and forth, it became clear that the structure of the anomaly could be described with bundles with a non-trivial homotopy group, or, in physics lingo, in terms of instantons. 

Instantons are a form of topological soliton; they are a solution to the &quot;classical&quot; field theory, having the property that they are stable and cannot decay (into plane waves, for example). Put differently: conventional field theory is built on the idea of a vacuum – roughly speaking, a flat empty space. Classically, this is the &quot;trivial&quot; solution; all fields vanish. However, one can also arrange the (classical) fields in such a way that they have a non-trivial global configuration. These non-trivial configurations are also candidates for the vacuum, for empty space; yet they are no longer flat or trivial; they contain a twist, the instanton. The quantum theory is able to interact with these configurations; when it does so, it manifests as the chiral anomaly. 

In mathematics, non-trivial configurations are found during the study of Dirac operators in their fully generalized setting, namely, on Riemannian manifolds in arbitrary dimensions. Mathematical tasks include finding and classifying structures and configurations. Famous results include the Atiyah–Singer index theorem for Dirac operators. Roughly speaking, the symmetries of Minkowski spacetime, Lorentz invariance, Laplacians, Dirac operators and the U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) fiber bundles can be taken to be a special case of a far more general setting in differential geometry; the exploration of the various possibilities accounts for much of the excitement in theories such as string theory; the richness of possibilities accounts for a certain perception of lack of progress. 

The Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly is seen experimentally, in the sense that it describes the decay of the neutral pion, and specifically, the width of the decay of the neutral pion into two photons. The neutral pion itself was discovered in the 1940s; its decay rate (width) was correctly estimated by J. Steinberger in 1949. The correct form of the anomalous divergence of the axial current is obtained by Schwinger in 1951 in a 2D model of electromagnetism and massless fermions. That the decay of the neutral pion is suppressed in the current algebra analysis of the chiral model is obtained by Sutherland and Veltman in 1967. An analysis and resolution of this anomalous result is provided by Adler and Bell &amp; Jackiw in 1969. A general structure of the anomalies is discussed by Bardeen in 1969.

The quark model of the pion indicates it is a bound state of a quark and an anti-quark. However, the quantum numbers, including parity and angular momentum, taken to be conserved, prohibit the decay of the pion, at least in the zero-loop calculations (quite simply, the amplitudes vanish.) If the quarks are assumed to be massive, not massless, then a chirality-violating decay is allowed; however, it is not of the correct size. (Chirality is not a constant of motion of massive spinors; they will change handedness as they propagate, and so mass is itself a chiral symmetry-breaking term. The contribution of the mass is given by the Sutherland and Veltman result; it is termed &quot;PCAC&quot;, the partially conserved axial current.) The Adler–Bell–Jackiw analysis provided in 1969 (as well as the earlier forms by Steinberger and Schwinger), do provide the correct decay width for the neutral pion. 

Besides explaining the decay of the pion, it has a second very important role. The one loop amplitude includes a factor that counts the grand total number of leptons that can circulate in the loop. In order to get the correct decay width, one must have exactly three generations of quarks, and not four or more. In this way, it plays an important role in constraining the Standard model. It provides a direct physical prediction of the number of quarks that can exist in nature.

Current day research is focused on similar phenomena in different settings, including non-trivial topological configurations of the electroweak theory, that is, the sphalerons. Other applications include the hypothetical non-conservation of baryon number in GUTs and other theories.

==General discussion==
In some theories of fermions with chiral symmetry, the quantization may lead to the breaking of this (global) chiral symmetry. In that case, the charge associated with the chiral symmetry is not conserved. The non-conservation happens in a process of tunneling from one vacuum to another. Such a process is called an instanton.

In the case of a symmetry related to the conservation of a fermionic particle number, one may understand the creation of such particles as follows. The definition of a particle is different in the two vacuum states between which the tunneling occurs; therefore a state of no particles in one vacuum corresponds to a state with some particles in the other vacuum. In particular, there is a Dirac sea of fermions and, when such a tunneling happens, it causes the energy levels of the sea fermions to gradually shift upwards for the particles and downwards for the anti-particles, or vice versa. This means particles which once belonged to the Dirac sea become real (positive energy) particles and particle creation happens.

Technically, in the path integral formulation, an anomalous symmetry is a symmetry of the action formula_3, but not of the measure and therefore &quot;not&quot; of the generating functional 
:formula_4

of the quantized theory ( is Planck&#x27;s action-quantum divided by 2). The measure formula_5 consists of a part depending on the fermion field formula_6 and a part depending on its complex conjugate formula_7. The transformations of both parts under a chiral symmetry do not cancel in general. Note that if formula_8 is a Dirac fermion, then the chiral symmetry can be written as formula_9 where formula_10 is the chiral gamma matrix acting on formula_8. From the formula for formula_12 one also sees explicitly that in the classical limit, anomalies don&#x27;t come into play, since in this limit only the extrema of formula_3 remain relevant.

The anomaly is proportional to the instanton number of a gauge field to which the fermions are coupled. (Note that the gauge symmetry is always non-anomalous and is exactly respected, as is required for the theory to be consistent.)

==Calculation==
The chiral anomaly can be calculated exactly by one-loop Feynman diagrams, e.g. Steinberger&#x27;s &quot;triangle diagram&quot;, contributing to the pion decays, and formula_14. The amplitude for this process can be calculated directly from the change in the measure of the fermionic fields under the chiral transformation.

Wess and Zumino developed a set of conditions on how the partition function ought to behave under gauge transformations called the Wess–Zumino consistency condition.

Fujikawa derived this anomaly using the correspondence between functional determinants and the partition function using the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. See Fujikawa&#x27;s method.

==An example: baryon number non-conservation==
The Standard Model of electroweak interactions has all the necessary ingredients for successful baryogenesis, although these interactions have never been observed and may be insufficient to explain the total baryon number of the observed universe if the initial baryon number of the universe at the time of the Big Bang is zero. Beyond the violation of charge conjugation formula_15 and CP violation formula_16 (charge+parity), baryonic charge violation appears through the Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly of the formula_17 group.

Baryons are not conserved by the usual electroweak interactions due to quantum chiral anomaly. The classic electroweak Lagrangian conserves baryonic charge. Quarks always enter in bilinear combinations formula_18, so that a quark can disappear only in collision with an antiquark. In other words, the classical baryonic current formula_19 is conserved:

:formula_20

However, quantum corrections known as the sphaleron destroy this conservation law: instead of zero in the right hand side of this equation, there is a non-vanishing quantum term,
:formula_21
where is a numerical constant vanishing for ℏ =0,
:formula_22
and the gauge field strength formula_23 is given by the expression
:formula_24

Electroweak sphalerons can only change the baryon and/or lepton number by 3 or multiples of 3 (collision of three baryons into three leptons/antileptons and vice versa).

An important fact is that the anomalous current non-conservation is proportional to the total derivative of a vector operator, formula_25 (this is non-vanishing due to instanton configurations of the gauge field, which are pure gauge at the infinity), where the anomalous current formula_26 is
:formula_27
which is the Hodge dual of the Chern–Simons 3-form.

===Geometric form===

In the language of differential forms, to any self-dual curvature form formula_28 we may assign the abelian 4-form formula_29. Chern–Weil theory shows that this 4-form is locally &quot;but not globally&quot; exact, with potential given by the Chern–Simons 3-form locally:

:formula_30.

Again, this is true only on a single chart, and is false for the global form formula_31 unless the instanton number vanishes.

To proceed further, we attach a &quot;point at infinity&quot; onto formula_32 to yield formula_33, and use the clutching construction to chart principal A-bundles, with one chart on the neighborhood of and a second on formula_34. The thickening around , where these charts intersect, is trivial, so their intersection is essentially formula_35. Thus instantons are classified by the third homotopy group formula_36, which for formula_37 is simply the third 3-sphere group formula_38.

The divergence of the baryon number current is (ignoring numerical constants)

:formula_39,

and the instanton number is

:formula_40.

Before entering provincial politics, he had been a member of Etobicoke City Council and the Metro Toronto Council. Stockwell&#x27;s father, Bill Stockwell, was also a prominent municipal politician.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
Stockwell was elected as a city of Etobicoke Controller in 1982, was defeated in his attempt at re-election in 1985, but was elected to the Metropolitan Toronto council in November 1988 representing Lakeshore-Queensway, in the Etobicoke region, and also served as chair of the Metro O&#x27;Keefe Centre for the Performing Arts during this period.

===Provincial===
Stockwell was elected to the Ontario provincial legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Linda LeBourdais by about 4,000 votes in Etobicoke West. The New Democratic Party won the election, and Stockwell sat on the opposition benches for the next five years.

The Tories won a majority in the provincial election of 1995, and Stockwell was easily elected in his own riding. Despite his experience, he was not appointed to cabinet by the new Premier, Mike Harris. He soon developed a reputation as one of the more prominent Red Tories in the Tory caucus.

Stockwell was elected Speaker of the Assembly on October 3, 1996. He was not Harris&#x27;s preferred choice for the position, but won with support from members in all three parties. Stockwell won a reputation for independence in the Speaker&#x27;s chair, and was not afraid to criticize members of his own party.

Stockwell played a key role in the anti-megacity filibuster of 1997, where the Opposition parties proposed thousands of amendments identical except for a few words. He ruled against the government when they moved that the legislature did not need to vote on each amendment, but in their favor when they suggested that the identical text did not need to be read aloud each time.

In the provincial election of 1999, Stockwell&#x27;s personal popularity was such that he was able to win an easy re-election in the redistributed riding of Etobicoke Centre after defeating fellow MPP Doug Ford, Sr. for then Progressive Conservative nomination. On June 17, 1999, he was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Labour.

Despite Stockwell&#x27;s reputation as a Red Tory, he implemented a number of right-wing policy directives as Labour Minister. He was largely credited with shepherding through the legislature a bill to increase the maximum work-week to 60 hours, and also promoted the Harris government&#x27;s &quot;Workplace Democracy Act&quot;, which made union organization more difficult. In addition to the Labour portfolio, Stockwell also served as Commissioner of the Board of Internal Economy for a few months in 2001.

Stockwell was a candidate to succeed Mike Harris in the 2002 PC leadership campaign. During this campaign, he claimed that the right-wing initiatives of Harris&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; were necessary in 1995, but no longer made sense in 2003. He won little support from party insiders, and placed last with four per cent of the vote. He supported Ernie Eves, the winning candidate, on the second ballot.

On April 15, 2002, Eves appointed Stockwell as Government House Leader and Minister of Environment and Energy. The Energy and Environment portfolios were broken up on August 22, 2002, with Stockwell keeping Environment.

On June 17, 2003, he resigned from cabinet in the wake of a controversy concerning the misuse of expenses. All expenses were referred to the provincial Integrity Commissioner who at that time was the Honourable Coulter A. Osbourne, a former Ontario Supreme Court judge. He undertook an exhaustive review. In his first report dated January 31, 2003, covering the period from June 26, 1995, to December 31, 2002, the Honourable Coulter A. Osbourne concluded: &quot;I am satisfied that the expenses which I have reviewed, net of reimbursements made, are allowable expenses (see section 15 of the Act).&quot; On June 9, 2003, he stated: &quot;I am pleased to report that all expense claims made for the period January 1st to March 31st met with the requirements of the Act and the Rules Governing the Expenses of Cabinet Ministers, Opposition Leaders and other persons.&quot; On June 3, 2004, covering the period April 3, 2003 to March 31, 2004, the Commissioner again stated: &quot;I am pleased to report that all requests for reimbursements were complied with and all expense claims reviewed were subsequently approved.&quot;

On July 25, 2003, Stockwell announced that he would not run in the 2003 election. He was later employed as a political consultant.

===Attempted return to Toronto City Council===

In 2013, Stockwell was one of several candidates for appointment to Toronto City Council to replace Doug Holyday in Ward 3. The Etobicoke Community Council recommended him to the city council as its preferred candidate for the appointment; however, October 10, 2013, the final city council vote selected Peter Leon. In September 2014, Stockwell registered as a candidate for Toronto City Council in Ward 4 in Etobicoke. He came in fourth place, with 9.24% of the vote, losing to John Campbell.

==Death==
Stockwell died in Toronto of cancer at the age of 60.

<text>Walkerton is a town in the municipality of Brockton, Bruce County, Ontario, Canada. It is the site of Brockton&#x27;s municipal offices and is the county seat. Walkerton is located on the Saugeen River, at the junction of King&#x27;s Highway 9 and the former King&#x27;s Highway 4 and is 75 km southwest of Owen Sound. As of 2011, the town had 4,967 people in the community.

On January 1, 1999, Walkerton became part of the Municipality of Brockton. The town is notable for the 2000 Walkerton &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak.

==History==
Walkerton was originally part of Brant Township and was first settled in 1849 by William Jasper and Edward Boulton who farmed to the east of the river. Other settlers from the same era included John Lundy, Moses Stewart and Thomas Bilkie who farmed to the west of the river. Joseph Walker arrived from Ireland in 1850 and is considered one of the founders of Walkerton. He built both saw mills and flour mills, surveyed the area into a town plot and encouraged businesses to locate here. Years later, Walker was the reeve of Brant for several terms, and was elected as the first mayor or Walkerton.

Although Walkerton was never incorporated as a village, it became a town in 1871, with a population of just under 1000. That increased to 2,604 by 1881, and to 3,061 by 1891 thanks to the arrival of the railroad which enabled the locals to ship their grain. The population dropped to 2,971 by 1901.

<doc id="312239" wikidata="Q1569811" url="?curid=312239" title="Visage (band)">
<text>Visage were a British synth-pop band formed in London in 1978. The band became closely linked to the burgeoning New Romantic fashion movement of the early 1980s, and are best known for their hit &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; which was released in late 1980. In the UK, the band achieved two Top 20 albums (&quot;Visage&quot; and &quot;The Anvil&quot;) and five Top 30 singles before the commercial failure of their third album (&quot;Beat Boy&quot;) led to their breakup in 1985.

The band saw various line-up changes over the years, all fronted by vocalist Steve Strange, who resurrected the band name in the 2000s. In 2013, the final line-up of the band released &quot;Hearts and Knives&quot;, the first new Visage album in 29 years. The band&#x27;s fifth and final album, &quot;Demons to Diamonds&quot;, was released in 2015, nine months after Strange had died following a heart attack.

== History ==
===First incarnation (1978–1985)===
Founding members Midge Ure and Rusty Egan started working on Visage to produce music to play at the clubs where Egan was DJing. Egan alongside Steve Strange was hosting David Bowie and Roxy Music club-nights weekly at &quot;Billy&#x27;s&quot; nightspot in London&#x27;s Soho district and Egan was eager to find new music to play, ultimately opting to create music himself with Ure. Steve Strange had briefly been in the punk/new wave bands The Moors Murderers and The Photons, and Egan was working with Ure in the band The Rich Kids. Ure and Egan recorded a demo which included the original track &quot;The Dancer&quot; of which a version appeared on the debut Visage album and a cover of the Zager and Evans hit &quot;In the Year 2525&quot;. Strange was then brought into the band to provide the face and voice of Visage with the line-up being completed with the addition of Ultravox keyboardist Billy Currie and three-fifths of the post-punk band Magazine – guitarist John McGeoch, keyboardist Dave Formula and bassist Barry Adamson (who left the band after playing on its debut single, but returned as a session musician). 

Producer Martin Rushent had heard some of the band&#x27;s material at Billy&#x27;s and financed further recordings with a view to signing the band to his new Genetic Records label. Visage recorded their first album at Rushent&#x27;s home studio in Berkshire, but Rushent&#x27;s label collapsed, and the band instead signed to Radar Records, a new independent label run by Rushent&#x27;s former colleague Martin Davis (the pair had worked together at United Artists Records). Visage released their first single &quot;Tar&quot; on Radar in September 1979, though the single failed to chart. By this time, however, Strange and Egan had relocated their themed club-nights to the Blitz club in Covent Garden from where the New Romantic movement would emerge. In mid-1980, David Bowie visited the club and asked Strange and three other Blitz regulars to appear in the video for his single &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, which helped to propel the New Romantic movement into the mainstream.

Although Visage&#x27;s self-titled debut album had been completed for several months, it was not released until November 1980 when the band was now signed to the major label Polydor Records. The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;, was released at the same time. The single became a hit in early 1981, making the top ten in the UK Singles Chart and several other countries, and reaching no. 1 in Germany and Switzerland. The album also became a Top 20 hit in the UK and was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry.

After further hits with the singles &quot;Mind of a Toy&quot; and the title track &quot;Visage&quot;, Strange struggled to reunite the band&#x27;s members again to record a second album due to their commitments with their respective bands; Ure had now joined Currie in Ultravox, Formula and Adamson with Magazine and McGeoch had joined Siouxsie and the Banshees. In late 1981, Visage went into the studio and recorded &quot;The Anvil&quot; as a five-piece band without McGeoch and only limited guest work from Adamson. The album, which was named after a gay nightclub in New York City, was released in March 1982 and became the band&#x27;s only Top 10 hit in the UK Albums Chart, producing two top-twenty singles with &quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;Night Train&quot;. Like their first album, &quot;The Anvil&quot; earned a Silver disc in the UK. Following this, Ure left Visage to concentrate on his work with Ultravox, who were now even more successful than Visage. Creative differences with Strange and Egan were also cited as reasons for his departure at the time.

Visage were now without Ure, McGeoch and Adamson, who went on to join Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Bassist Steve Barnacle was recruited to replace Adamson, and the remaining lineup recorded the stand-alone single &quot;Pleasure Boys&quot;, which was released in October 1982. The single failed to prolong their string of hits and peaked just outside the UK Top 40.

Although still recording, Visage then took a two-year hiatus from releasing any new material due to contractual difficulties with their management company. Polydor issued a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, &quot;Fade to Grey – The Singles Collection&quot;, which included all the singles released to date and the previously unreleased &quot;In the Year 2525&quot;. Although the album was certified Gold in the UK for pre-release sales to stores, it only peaked at No. 38 in the UK Albums Chart after its release in November 1983.

In 1984, with their contractual problems resolved, Visage returned with their third album, &quot;Beat Boy&quot;. Released in October 1984, the album was a critical and commercial failure, peaking at No. 79 in the UK. Two singles from the album, &quot;Love Glove&quot; and &quot;Beat Boy&quot;, also failed to make the UK top 40. By this time, Billy Currie and Dave Formula had also left the band (though they received a &quot;special thanks&quot; credit on the album sleeve for their input), leaving only Strange and Egan from the original line-up along with Steve Barnacle and new recruits Gary Barnacle (Steve Barnacle&#x27;s brother) and Andy Barnett who also was a member of FM and ASAP. A decision to make Visage a live band instead of a strictly studio-based project also failed to meet with success and the band split in 1985. Their final release was a video compilation of the band&#x27;s promotional videos and other footage, including Strange&#x27;s 1983 trip to North Africa. The compilation does not include the original video for the &quot;Love Glove&quot; single which was filmed at a late-night Dockland location in London in 1984.

Following the demise of Visage, Strange and Barnacle then formed the short-lived band Strange Cruise, though this too proved unsuccessful. Visage returned to the charts once more when a Bassheads remix of &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; was a UK Top 40 hit in 1993.

=== Second incarnation (2002–2011) ===
Steve Strange reappeared on the music scene in 2002, after several years of heroin addiction and other personal problems. He performed several Visage songs on the Here and Now Xmas Tour – a revival of 1980s pop acts. Some time after the performance, Strange created a &quot;Mark II&quot; of Visage with people from several electronic bands and projects: Steven Young, Sandrine Gouriou and Rosie Harris from Seize and Ross Tregenza from Jetstream Lovers/Goteki. After the announcement of the formation of the new line-up and several television appearances, plans for reworking old material and releasing a new record made slow progress. An updated version of &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; was produced in 2005. In 2006, Strange also collaborated with the electronic duo Punx Soundcheck and provided vocals on the track &quot;In the Dark&quot;, which was included on the duo&#x27;s debut double album &quot;When Machines Ruled the World&quot;. The first Visage mk II track was released in 2007, entitled &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;. Written by Strange with Visage mk II member Ross Tregenza, the track was co-produced by original Visage member Dave Formula. This song was made available for download from their official website in return for a donation to the charity Children in Need. No further new material surfaced from this line-up.

The long-since deleted Visage VHS video collection was repackaged for release on DVD in 2006, though it was mistakenly titled &quot;Visage Live&quot;.

In 2008, Strange (and Visage II keyboardist Sandrine Gouriou) made an appearance in the BBC drama series &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; which is set in 1981. In it, they performed the song &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; in a scene set in the &quot;Blitz&quot; nightclub.

In 2009, Strange and Egan appeared in Living TV&#x27;s &quot;Pop Goes the Band&quot;, a series in which pop stars from the 1980s are given a complete makeover in return for a one-off performance. The Visage episode aired on 16 March 2009, and was the first time that the two men had spoken in over 20 years. The episode focused (like others in the series) more on getting them fit in the gym than on the current state of their relationship, though they appeared to get on well enough. At the culmination of the episode, they performed &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;.

In 2010, new remixes of &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; were produced by club DJs Michael Gray and Lee Mortimer to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the song. The remixes were included on a new compilation album, &quot;The Face – The Very Best of Visage&quot;, which was released in March 2010.

=== Final incarnation (2012–2015) ===
On 8 January 2013, Strange appeared as a guest on the &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; programme to discuss the forthcoming David Bowie album &quot;The Next Day&quot;. During the interview he mentioned that a new Visage album was also due for release in 2013.

Also on 8 January 2013, Visage launched their new website, Twitter, Facebook and Soundcloud accounts and announced their new line-up, consisting of Steve Strange, former Visage bassist Steve Barnacle, former Ultravox guitarist Robin Simon, and Lauren Duvall on vocals. A single from the album, &quot;Shameless Fashion&quot;, was made available as a free download from the band&#x27;s Facebook page, and a physical CD-single was released on 6 May 2013. The band&#x27;s new album, &quot;Hearts and Knives&quot;, was released on 20 May 2013. A second single from the album, &quot;Dreamer I Know&quot;, was released in July 2013, and a third single, &quot;Never Enough&quot;, was released in December. Throughout the second half of 2013, the band also embarked on a series of live dates in the UK and Europe. &quot;Hidden Sign&quot; was the fourth single to be taken from &quot;Hearts and Knives&quot;, released in May 2014 and &quot;She&#x27;s Electric (Coming Around)&quot; was released as the fifth and final single in August 2014.

In December 2014, Visage released &quot;Orchestral&quot;, a mostly live album containing twelve Visage songs remade with a symphony orchestra. A single of the orchestral version of &quot;Fade To Grey&quot; was released ahead of the album in November 2014.

On 12 February 2015, frontman Steve Strange died of a heart attack while on holiday in Egypt, aged 55. While Strange&#x27;s death ultimately meant the end of Visage, the band completed the album they had already been working on with Strange prior to his death. On 2 September 2015, an organisation known as The Steve Strange Collective was announced. Run by Strange&#x27;s friends and relatives, they oversaw the release of the final Visage album, &quot;Demons to Diamonds&quot;, on 6 November 2015.

<text>In complexity theory, UP (unambiguous non-deterministic polynomial-time) is the complexity class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time on an unambiguous Turing machine with at most one accepting path for each input. UP contains [[P (complexity)|P]] and is contained in [[NP (complexity)|NP]].

A common reformulation of NP states that a language is in NP if and only if a given answer can be verified by a deterministic machine in polynomial time. Similarly, a language is in UP if a given answer can be verified in polynomial time, and the verifier machine only accepts at most &quot;one&quot; answer for each problem instance. More formally, a language &quot;L&quot; belongs to UP if there exists a two-input polynomial-time algorithm &quot;A&quot; and a constant &quot;c&quot; such that 
:if x in &quot;L&quot; , then there exists a unique certificate &quot;y&quot; with formula_1 such that 
:if x is not in &quot;L&quot;, there is no certificate &quot;y&quot; with formula_1 such that 
:algorithm &quot;A&quot; verifies &quot;L&quot; in polynomial time.

UP (and its complement co-UP) contain both the integer factorization problem and parity game problem. Because determined effort has yet to find a polynomial-time solution to any of these problems, it is suspected to be difficult to show P=UP, or even P=(UP ∩ co-UP).

The Valiant–Vazirani theorem states that NP is contained in RPPromise-UP, which means that there is a randomized reduction from any problem in NP to a problem in [[promise problem|Promise-UP]].

UP is not known to have any complete problems.

<text>Ruth Barbara Rendell, Baroness Rendell of Babergh, (; 17 February 1930 – 2 May 2015) was an English author of thrillers and psychological murder mysteries.

Rendell is best known for creating Chief Inspector Wexford. A second string of works was a series of unrelated crime novels that explored the psychological background of criminals and their victims. This theme was developed further in a third series of novels, published under the pseudonym Barbara Vine. 

==Early life==
Rendell was born as Ruth Barbara Grasemann in 1930, in South Woodford, Essex (now Greater London). Her parents were teachers. Her mother, Ebba Kruse, was born in Sweden to Danish parents and brought up in Denmark; her father, Arthur Grasemann, was English. As a result of spending Christmas and other holidays in Scandinavia, Rendell learned Swedish and Danish. Rendell was educated at the County High School for Girls in Loughton, Essex, the town to which the family moved during her childhood. In 2016 a blue plaque was unveiled at her former home, 45 Millsmead Way, Loughton, in recognition of her time living there.

After high school, she became a feature writer for her local Essex paper, the &quot;Chigwell Times&quot;. She submitted a story narrating a local sports club dinner she had not attended. Because of her absence at the dinner, she did not know that the after-dinner speaker had died midway through the speech, and failed to report it. She was subsequently forced to resign.

==Personal life==
Rendell met her husband Don Rendell when she was working as a newswriter. They married in 1950, when she was 20, and in 1953 had a son, Simon, now a psychiatrist -social worker who lives in the U.S. state of Colorado. The couple divorced in 1975 but remarried two years later. Don Rendell died in 1999 from prostate cancer.

She made the county of Suffolk her home for many years, using the settings in several of her novels. She lived in the villages of Polstead and later Groton, both east of Sudbury. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1996 Birthday Honours and a life peer as Baroness Rendell of Babergh, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk, on 24 October 1997. She sat in the House of Lords for the Labour Party. In 1998, Rendell was named in a list of the party&#x27;s biggest private financial donors. She introduced into the Lords the bill that would later become the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (the intent was to prevent the practice).

In August 2014, Rendell was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Rendell was a vegetarian who was described as living mostly on fruit. She described herself as &quot;slightly agoraphobic&quot; and slept in a specially made four-poster bed because &quot;I like to feel enclosed.&quot;

==Awards==
Baroness Rendell&#x27;s awards include the Silver, Gold, and Cartier Diamond Daggers from the Crime Writers&#x27; Association, three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America, The Arts Council National Book Awards, and The Sunday Times Literary Award. A number of her works (see the section below) have been adapted for film or television. She was also a patron of the charity Kids for Kids which helps children in rural areas of Darfur. There is a blue plaque on one of her homes, 45 Millsmead Way, in Loughton. This was unveiled by her son Simon on 24 February 2016. Four of her novels appear on the British-based Crime Writers Association Poll (1990) of the best crime fiction novels ever written: two under the Rendell name and two under her pen name of Barbara Vine.

Her Crime Writer’s Association Dagger wins (four Gold, one Silver and one Cartier Diamond) remains unmatched, as does her record of being the first author to be nominated and win under multiple names. Her unparalleled Edgar and Dagger finalist nominations include: &quot;A Judgement In Stone&quot; (1977 Gold Dagger finalist), &quot;A Sleeping Life&quot; (1979 Edgar finalist for Best Novel), &quot;Make Death Love Me&quot; (1980 Edgar finalist for Best Novel), The &quot;Speaker Of Mandarin&quot; (1983 Gold Dagger finalist), &quot;An Unkindness Of Ravens&quot; and &quot;The Tree Of Hands&quot; (both 1986 Edgar finalists for Best Novel), &quot;A Dark-Adapted Eye&quot; (as Barbara Vine, 1986 Gold Dagger finalist), &quot;A Fatal Inversion&quot; (as Barbara Vine, 1988 Macavity Award finalist for Best Novel), and &quot;Going Wrong&quot; (1990 Gold Dagger finalist.) Additionally, she was nominated four times in the Edgar Best Short Story category (in 1976 for &quot;The Fall Of The Coin&quot; and 1977 for &quot;People Don’t Do Such Things&quot;), winning twice for &quot;The Fallen Curtain&quot; (1975) and &quot;The New Girlfriend&quot; (1984).

==Death==
Rendell suffered a stroke on 7 January 2015, and she died on 2 May at St George&#x27;s Hospital in Tooting, London.

=== Legacy ===
The Ruth Rendell Award was introduced in 2016 by the National Literacy Trust. It is awarded to authors for their work in inspiring children and improving their literacy.

==Developing the thriller genre==
Rendell wrote two unpublished novels before the 1964 publication of &quot;From Doon with Death&quot;, which was purchased for £75 by John Long; it was the first mystery to feature Chief Inspector Reginald Wexford. Rendell said that the character of Wexford was based on herself. &quot;The Monster in the Box&quot;, released in October 2009, was widely suggested to be Wexford&#x27;s last case. This was incorrect; however it was the final novel featuring Wexford as an employed policeman. In the two following novels, &quot;The Vault&quot; and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Nightingale,&quot; he was retired but was still involved in police investigations as a &quot;consultant&quot;.

In &quot;Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford&quot; by Daniel Mallory he says (based on a 1990 interview with Rendell by Marilyn Stasio) that Rendell refers to &quot;the hated Agatha&quot; (Christie) and &quot;that awful Marple woman&quot;; and says of St. Mary Mead that she &quot;can hardly bear to say the name of that village&quot; where &quot;one finds a lot of normal, law-abiding people living ordinary, blameless lives, who suddenly decide to murder their aunt. Well, I don&#x27;t believe that.&quot; (&quot;Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford&quot; by Daniel Mallory; from 1990 Rendell interview with Marilyn Stasio)

In addition to these police procedurals starring Wexford, Rendell wrote psychological crime novels exploring such themes as romantic obsession, misperceived communication, the impact of chance and coincidence, and the humanity of the criminals involved. Among such books are &quot;A Judgement in Stone&quot;, &quot;The Face of Trespass&quot;, &quot;Live Flesh&quot;, &quot;Talking to Strange Men&quot;, &quot;The Killing Doll&quot;, &quot;Going Wrong&quot; and &quot;Adam and Eve and Pinch Me&quot;. For the last novel published in her lifetime, &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;, she returned to the Loughton of her childhood, with an implied comparison of the moral climate of wartime England and 2014.
Rendell created a third strand of writing with the publication in 1986 of &quot;A Dark-Adapted Eye&quot; under her pseudonym Barbara Vine (the name was derived from her own middle name and her great-grandmother&#x27;s maiden name). &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Carpet&quot;, &quot;A Fatal Inversion&quot; and &quot;Asta&#x27;s Book&quot; (alternative U.S. title, &quot;Anna&#x27;s Book&quot;), among others, inhabited the same territory as her psychological crime novels while further developing themes of human misunderstandings and the unintended consequences of family secrets and hidden crimes. The author was noted for her elegant prose and sharp insights into the human mind, as well as her cogent plots and characters. Rendell injected the social changes of the last 40 years into her work, bringing awareness to such issues as domestic violence.

==Adaptations of her works==
The Inspector Wexford series was successfully televised, starring George Baker as Inspector Wexford and Christopher Ravenscroft as Detective Mike Burden, under the title &quot;The Ruth Rendell Mysteries&quot;, with 48 episodes from 1987 to 2000. Rendell praised Baker&#x27;s performance, stating &quot;It was a marvellous achievement as an actor to make him more and better than the author intended.&quot; Many of her other works have been adapted for film and television. She said that Claude Chabrol&#x27;s 1995 version of &quot;A Judgement in Stone&quot;, &quot;La Cérémonie&quot; with Sandrine Bonnaire, was one of the few film adaptations of her work that she was happy with. The novel was also filmed in 1986 with Rita Tushingham. Chabrol made &quot;La Demoiselle d&#x27;honneur&quot; in 2004, based on &quot;The Bridesmaid&quot;.

Other adaptations are &quot;Diary of the Dead&quot; (1976), from the book &quot;One Across, Two Down&quot;; the 1997 Pedro Almodóvar film &quot;Live Flesh&quot;; &quot;The Tree of Hands&quot;, directed by Giles Foster for Granada with Lauren Bacall (U.S. title: &quot;Innocent Victim&quot;); and another version of &quot;The Tree of Hands&quot;, &quot;Betty Fisher et autres histoires&quot; (2001, a.k.a. &quot;Alias Betty&quot;), with screenplay and direction by Claude Miller. François Ozon&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;The New Girlfriend&quot; was based on Rendell&#x27;s short story of the same name. Two episodes of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; were based on Rendell&#x27;s short stories - &quot;A Glowing Future&quot; (series 4, episode 15) and &quot;People Don&#x27;t Do Such Things&quot; (series 8, episode 1).

<doc id="312248" wikidata="Q314218" url="?curid=312248" title="Peter, King of Hungary">
<text>Peter (; 1010 or 1011 – 1046, or late 1050s), known as Peter Orseolo or Peter the Venetian, was King of Hungary twice. He first succeeded his uncle, King Stephen I, in 1038. His favoritism towards his foreign courtiers caused an uprising which ended with his 1041 deposition. Peter was restored in 1044 by Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. He accepted the Emperor&#x27;s suzerainty during his second reign, which ended in 1046 after a pagan uprising. Hungarian chronicles are unanimous that Peter was executed by order of his successor, Andrew I, but the chronicler Cosmas of Prague&#x27;s reference to his alleged marriage around 1055 suggests that he may also have survived his second deposition.

==Life==
===Before 1038===
Peter Orseolo was born in Venice, the only son of Doge Otto Orseolo. His mother Grimelda was a sister of Stephen I, the first King of Hungary; historian Gyula Kristó suggests that he was born in 1010 or 1011. The Venetians rose up and deposed Otto Orseolo in 1026. Peter did not follow his father, who fled to the Byzantine court in Constantinople; he instead went to Hungary, where his uncle appointed him commander of the royal army.

Emeric, Stephen&#x27;s only son to survive infancy, died in an accident in 1031. Stephen&#x27;s cousin Vazul had the strongest claim to the throne, but the King overlooked him and named Peter as his heir. On Stephen&#x27;s order, Vazul was blinded shortly thereafter and his three sonsLevente, Andrew and Béla exiled, which strengthened Peter&#x27;s right of succession. The King asked Peter to take an oath respecting the property of his wife, Queen Giselle, suggesting that Peter&#x27;s relationship with his aunt was tense.

===First rule (1038–1041)===

Peter succeeded King Stephen I, who died on 15 August 1038, and adopted an active foreign policy. Hungarian troops plundered Bavaria in 1039 and 1040, and invaded Bohemia in 1040 to assist Duke Bretislav I against Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. Hungarian chronicles recount that Peter preferred the company of Germans (&quot;who roared like wild beasts&quot;) and Italians (&quot;who chattered and twittered like swallows&quot;), which made him unpopular among his subjects. He introduced new taxes, seized Church revenue and deposed two bishops.

Audaciously, Peter confiscated Queen Giselle&#x27;s property and took her into custody. She sought help from Hungarian lords, who blamed one of Peter&#x27;s favorites (Budo) for the monarch&#x27;s misdeeds and demanded that Budo be put on trial. When the King refused, the lords seized and murdered his unpopular advisor and deposed the monarch in 1041. They elected a new king, Samuel Aba, who was a brother-in-law or another nephew of King Stephen I.

===Exile (1041–1044)===
Peter first fled to Austria, seeking the protection of his brother-in-law, Margrave Adalbert. He approached Emperor Henry III for help against Samuel Aba. The new Hungarian monarch invaded Austria in February 1042, but Adalbert routed Aba&#x27;s troops. Henry III launched his first expedition against Hungary in early 1042. His forces advanced north of the Danube to the river Garam (Hron, Slovakia). The Emperor planned to restore Peter, but the locals were strongly opposed. Accordingly, the Emperor appointed another (unnamed) member of the Hungarian royal family to administer the territories. 

The Emperor returned to Hungary in the early summer of 1044, and was joined in his advance by many Hungarian lords. The decisive battle was fought on 5 June at Ménfő (near Győr), where Samuel Aba&#x27;s forces were defeated. Although Aba escaped from the battlefield, Peter&#x27;s supporters soon captured and killed him.

===Second rule (1044–1046)===
Following Samuel Aba&#x27;s death, Emperor Henry entered Székesfehérvár and restored Peter. Peter introduced Bavarian law in his realm, which suggests that Hungary became an imperial fief. He accepted the Emperor&#x27;s suzerainty on Whitsun 1045, giving his royal lance to his overlord (who returned to Hungary). A number of plots to overthrow Peter indicate that he remained unpopular. Two of King Stephen I&#x27;s maternal cousins (Bolya and Bonyha) conspired against Peter in 1045, but the King had them arrested, tortured and executed. Bishop Gerard of Csanád invited Vazul&#x27;s exiled sons to the country. An uprising by pagan commoners ended Peter&#x27;s second rule in 1046.
Peter planned to flee again to the Holy Roman Empire, but Vazul&#x27;s son Andrew (who had returned to Hungary) invited him to a meeting at Székesfehérvár. The deposed king soon realised that Andrew&#x27;s envoys actually wanted to arrest him. He fled to a fortified manor at Zámoly, but his opponent&#x27;s supporters seized it and captured him three days later. All 14th-century Hungarian chronicles attest that Peter was blinded, which caused his death. However, the near-contemporary Cosmas of Prague relates that Judith of Schweinfurt, widow of Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia who was expelled by her son, fled to Hungary and married Peter about 1055 &quot;as an insult to&quot; her son &quot;and all the Czechs&quot;. If the latter report is reliable, Peter survived the ordeal and died during the late 1050s. He was buried in the cathedral of Pécs. His original tomb was excavated in June 2019.

==Family==
The name and family of Peter&#x27;s wife are unknown, but Gyula Kristó suggests that she was of German origin. Historians debate the validity of Cosmas of Prague&#x27;s report of Peter&#x27;s second marriage to the widowed Judith of Schweinfurt. Lisa Wolverton, the chronicle&#x27;s translator, says that Cosmas misinterpreted his sources (which describe the marriage of Judith of Swabia to King Solomon of Hungary). On the other hand, Kristó writes that Cosmas&#x27;s report may suggest that Peter survived his blinding. The following family tree presents Peter the Venetian&#x27;s ancestors and his relatives who are mentioned in the article:



&quot;*A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian woman.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;**Samuel Aba might have been Géza&#x27;s grandson instead of his son-in-law.&quot;

<text>Bryophytes () are a group of land plants (embryophytes), sometimes treated as a taxonomic division, that contains three groups of non-vascular land plants: the liverworts, hornworts, and mosses (Bryophyta sensu lato). In the strict sense, the division Bryophyta consists of the mosses only. Bryophytes are characteristically limited in size and prefer moist habitats although some species can survive in drier environments. The bryophytes consist of about 20,000 plant species. Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they do not produce flowers or seeds. They reproduce sexually by spores and asexually by fragmentation or the production of gemmae.

Though bryophytes were considered a paraphyletic group in recent years, almost all of the most recent phylogenetic evidence supports the monophyly of this group, as originally classified by Wilhelm Schimper in 1879.

The term &quot;bryophyte&quot; comes .

==Features==
The defining features of bryophytes are:
* Their life cycles are dominated by a multicellular haploid gametophyte stage
* Their sporophytes are diploid and unbranched
* They do not have a true vascular tissue containing lignin (although some have specialized tissues for the transport of water)

== Habitat ==
Bryophytes exist in a wide variety of habitats. They can be found growing in a range of temperatures (cold arctics and in hot deserts), elevations (sea-level to alpine), and moisture (dry deserts to wet rain forests). Bryophytes can grow where vascularized plants cannot because they do not depend on roots for uptake of nutrients from soil. Bryophytes can survive on rocks and bare soil.

==Life cycle==

Like all land plants (embryophytes), bryophytes have life cycles with alternation of generations. In each cycle, a haploid gametophyte, each of whose cells contains a fixed number of unpaired chromosomes, alternates with a diploid sporophyte, whose cells contain two sets of paired chromosomes. Gametophytes produce haploid sperm and eggs which fuse to form diploid zygotes that grow into sporophytes. Sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis, that grow into gametophytes.

Bryophytes are gametophyte dominant, meaning that the more prominent, longer-lived plant is the haploid gametophyte. The diploid sporophytes appear only occasionally and remain attached to and nutritionally dependent on the gametophyte. In bryophytes, the sporophytes are always unbranched and produce a single sporangium (spore producing capsule), but each gametophyte can give rise to several sporophytes at once.

Liverworts, mosses and hornworts spend most of their lives as gametophytes. Gametangia (gamete-producing organs), archegonia and antheridia, are produced on the gametophytes, sometimes at the tips of shoots, in the axils of leaves or hidden under thalli. Some bryophytes, such as the liverwort &quot;Marchantia&quot;, create elaborate structures to bear the gametangia that are called gametangiophores. Sperm are flagellated and must swim from the antheridia that produce them to archegonia which may be on a different plant. Arthropods can assist in transfer of sperm.

Fertilized eggs become zygotes, which develop into sporophyte embryos inside the archegonia. Mature sporophytes remain attached to the gametophyte. They consist of a stalk called a seta and a single sporangium or capsule. Inside the sporangium, haploid spores are produced by meiosis. These are dispersed, most commonly by wind, and if they land in a suitable environment can develop into a new gametophyte. Thus bryophytes disperse by a combination of swimming sperm and usually wind-dispersed spores, in a manner similar to lycophytes, ferns and other cryptogams.

The sporophyte develops differently in the three groups. Both mosses and hornworts have a meristem zone where cell division occurs. In hornworts, the meristem starts at the base where the foot ends, and the division of cells pushes the sporophyte body upwards. In mosses, the meristem is located between the capsule and the top of the stalk (seta), and produces cells downward, elongating the stalk and elevating the capsule. In liverworts the meristem is absent and the elongation of the sporophyte is caused almost exclusively by cell expansion.

===Sexuality===
The arrangement of antheridia and archegonia on an individual bryophyte plant is usually constant within a species, although in some species it may depend on environmental conditions. The main division is between species in which the antheridia and archegonia occur on the same plant and those in which they occur on different plants. The term monoicous may be used where antheridia and archegonia occur on the same gametophyte and the term dioicous where they occur on different gametophytes.

In seed plants, &quot;monoecious&quot; is used where flowers with anthers (microsporangia) and flowers with ovules (megasporangia) occur on the same sporophyte and &quot;dioecious&quot; where they occur on different sporophytes. These terms occasionally may be used instead of &quot;monoicous&quot; and &quot;dioicous&quot; to describe bryophyte gametophytes. &quot;Monoecious&quot; and &quot;monoicous&quot; are both derived from the Greek for &quot;one house&quot;, &quot;dioecious&quot; and &quot;dioicous&quot; from the Greek for two houses. The use of the &quot;-oicy&quot; terminology refers to the gametophyte sexuality of bryophytes as distinct from the sporophyte sexuality of seed plants.

Monoicous plants are necessarily hermaphroditic, meaning that the same plant produces gametes of both sexes. The exact arrangement of the antheridia and archegonia in monoicous plants varies. They may be borne on different shoots (autoicous), on the same shoot but not together in a common structure (paroicous or paroecious), or together in a common &quot;inflorescence&quot; (synoicous or synoecious). Dioicous plants are unisexual, meaning that an individual plant has only one sex. All four patterns (autoicous, paroicous, synoicous and dioicous) occur in species of the moss genus &quot;Bryum&quot;.

==Classification and phylogeny==

Traditionally, all living land plants without vascular tissues were classified in a single taxonomic group, often a division (or phylum). The term &quot;Bryophyta&quot; was first suggested by Braun in 1864. As early as 1879, the term Bryophyta was used by German bryologist Wilhelm Schimper to describe a group containing all three bryophyte clades (though at the time, hornworts were considered part of the liverworts). G.M. Smith placed this group between Algae and Pteridophyta. Although a 2005 study supported this traditional monophyletic view, by 2010 a broad consensus had emerged among systematists that bryophytes as a whole are not a natural group (i.e., are paraphyletic). However, a 2014 study concluded that these previous phylogenies, which were based on nucleic acid sequences, were subject to composition biases, and that, furthermore, phylogenies based on amino acid sequences suggested that the bryophytes are monophyletic after all. Since then, partially thanks to a proliferation of genomic and transcriptomic datasets, almost all phylogenetics studies based on nuclear and chloroplastic sequences have concluded that the bryophytes form a monophyletic group. Nevertheless, phylogenies based on mitochondrial sequences fail to support the monophyletic view.

The three bryophyte clades are the Marchantiophyta (liverworts), Bryophyta (mosses) and Anthocerotophyta (hornworts). However, it has been proposed that these clades are de-ranked to the classes Marchantiopsida, Bryopsida, and Anthocerotopsida, respectively. There is now strong evidence that the liverworts and mosses belong to a monophyletic clade, called Setaphyta.

===Monophyletic view===
The favored model, based on amino acids phylogenies, indicates bryophytes as a monophyletic group:

Consistent with this view, compared to other living land plants, all three lineages lack vascular tissue containing lignin and branched sporophytes bearing multiple sporangia. The prominence of the gametophyte in the life cycle is also a shared feature of the three bryophyte lineages (extant vascular plants are all sporophyte dominant). However, if this phylogeny is correct, then the complex sporophyte of living vascular plants might have evolved independently of the simpler unbranched sporophyte present in bryophytes. Furthermore, this view implies that stomata evolved only once in plant evolution, before being subsequently lost in the liverworts.

===Paraphyletic view===

In this alternative view, the Setaphyta grouping is retained, but hornworts instead are sister to vascular plants. (Another paraphyletic view involves hornworts branching out first.)

===Traditional morphology===
Traditionally, when basing classifications on morphological characters, bryophytes have been distinguished by their lack of vascular structure. However, this distinction is problematic, firstly because some of the earliest-diverging (but now extinct) non-bryophytes, such as the horneophytes, did not have true vascular tissue, and secondly because many mosses have well-developed water-conducting vessels. A more useful distinction may lie in the structure of their sporophytes. In bryophytes, the sporophyte is a simple unbranched structure with a single spore-forming organ (sporangium), whereas in all other land plants, the polysporangiophytes, the sporophyte is branched and carries many sporangia. The contrast is shown in the cladogram below:

==Evolution==
There have probably been several different terrestrialization events, in which originally aquatic organisms colonized the land, just within the lineage of the Viridiplantae. Between 510 and 630 million years ago, however, land plants emerged within the green algae. Molecular phylogenetic studies conclude that bryophytes are the earliest diverging lineages of the extant land plants. They provide insights into the migration of plants from aquatic environments to land. A number of physical features link bryophytes to both land plants and aquatic plants.

=== Similarities to algae and vascular plants ===

Green algae, bryophytes and vascular plants all have chlorophyll a and b, and the chloroplast structures are similar. Like green algae and land plants, bryophytes also produce starch stored in the plastids and contain cellulose in their walls. Distinct adaptations observed in bryophytes have allowed plants to colonize Earth&#x27;s terrestrial environments. To prevent desiccation of plant tissues in a terrestrial environment, a waxy cuticle covering the soft tissue of the plant may be present, providing protection. In hornworts and mosses, stomata provide gas exchange between the atmosphere and an internal intercellular space system. The development of gametangia provided further protection specifically for gametes, the zygote and the developing sporophyte. The bryophytes and vascular plants (embryophytes) also have embryonic development which is not seen in green algae. While bryophytes have no truly vascularized tissue, they do have organs that are specialized for transport of water and other specific functions, analogous for example to the functions of leaves and stems in vascular land plants.

Bryophytes depend on water for reproduction and survival. In common with ferns and lycophytes, a thin layer of water is required on the surface of the plant to enable the movement of the flagellated sperm between gametophytes and the fertilization of an egg.

== Uses ==
Environmental
Characteristics of bryophytes make them useful to the environment. Depending on the specific plant texture, bryophytes have been shown to help improve the water retention and air space within soil. Bryophytes are used in pollution studies to indicate soil pollution (such as the presence of heavy metals), air pollution, and UV-B radiation. Gardens in Japan are designed with moss to create peaceful sanctuaries. Some bryophytes have been found to produce natural pesticides. The liverwort, &quot;Plagiochila,&quot; produces a chemical that is poisonous to mice. Other bryophytes produce chemicals that are antifeedants which protect them from being eaten by slugs. When &quot;Phythium sphagnum&quot; is sprinkled on the soil of germinating seeds, it inhibits growth of &quot;damping off fungus&quot; which would otherwise kill young seedlings.

Commercial

Peat is a fuel produced from dried bryophytes, typically &quot;Sphagnum.&quot; Bryophytes&#x27; antibiotic properties and ability to retain water make them a useful packaging material for vegetables, flowers, and bulbs. Also, because of its antibiotic properties, &quot;Sphagnum&quot; was used as a surgical dressing in World War I.

<doc id="312250" wikidata="Q15846551" url="?curid=312250" title="Partition function (number theory)">
<text>In number theory, the partition function represents the number of possible partitions of a non-negative integer . For instance, because the integer 4 has the five partitions , , , , and .

No closed-form expression for the partition function is known, but it has both asymptotic expansions that accurately approximate it and recurrence relations by which it can be calculated exactly. It grows as an exponential function of the square root of its argument. The multiplicative inverse of its generating function is the Euler function; by Euler&#x27;s pentagonal number theorem this function is an alternating sum of pentagonal number powers of its argument.

Srinivasa Ramanujan first discovered that the partition function has nontrivial patterns in modular arithmetic, now known as Ramanujan&#x27;s congruences. For instance, whenever the decimal representation of ends in the digit 4 or 9, the number of partitions of will be divisible by 5.

==Definition and examples==
For a positive integer , is the number of distinct ways of representing as a sum of positive integers. For the purposes of this definition, the order of the terms in the sum is irrelevant: two sums with the same terms in a different order are not considered to be distinct.

By convention , as there is one way (the empty sum) of representing zero as a sum of positive integers. Furthermore when is negative.

The first few values of the partition function, starting with , are:
Some exact values of for larger values of include:
formula_1

==Generating function==
The generating function for &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is given by
formula_2
The equality between the products on the first and second lines of this formula
is obtained by expanding each factor formula_3 into the geometric series formula_4
To see that the expanded product equals the sum on the first line,
apply the distributive law to the product. This expands the product into a sum of monomials of the form formula_5 for some sequence of coefficients
formula_6, only finitely many of which can be non-zero.
The exponent of the term is formula_7, and this sum can be interpreted as a representation of formula_8 as a partition into formula_6 copies of each number formula_10. Therefore, the number of terms of the product that have exponent formula_8 is exactly formula_12, the same as the coefficient of formula_13 in the sum on the left.
Therefore, the sum equals the product.

The function that appears in the denominator in the third and fourth lines of the formula is the Euler function. The equality between the product on the first line and the formulas in the third and fourth lines is Euler&#x27;s pentagonal number theorem.
The exponents of formula_14 in these lines are the pentagonal numbers formula_15 for formula_16 (generalized somewhat from the usual pentagonal numbers, which come from the same formula for the positive values The pattern of positive and negative signs in the third line comes from the term formula_17 in the fourth line: even choices of formula_18 produce positive terms, and odd choices produce negative terms.

More generally, the generating function for the partitions of formula_8 into numbers selected from a set formula_20 of positive integers can be found by taking only those terms in the first product for which formula_21. This result is due to Leonhard Euler. The formulation of Euler&#x27;s generating function is a special case of a formula_22-Pochhammer symbol and is similar to the product formulation of many modular forms, and specifically the Dedekind eta function.

==Recurrence relations==
The same sequence of pentagonal numbers appears in a recurrence relation for the partition function:

formula_23
As base cases, formula_24 is taken to equal formula_25, and formula_26 is taken to be zero for negative formula_18. Although the sum on the right side appears infinite, it has only finitely many nonzero terms,
coming from the nonzero values of formula_18 in the range
formula_29
The recurrence relation can also be written in the equivalent form
formula_30

Another recurrence relation for formula_12 can be given in terms of the sum of divisors function :
formula_32
If formula_33 denotes the number of partitions of formula_8 with no repeated parts then it follows by splitting each partition into its even parts and odd parts, and dividing the even parts by two, that
formula_35

== Congruences ==

Srinivasa Ramanujan is credited with discovering that the partition function has nontrivial patterns in modular arithmetic.
For instance the number of partitions is divisible by five whenever the decimal representation of formula_8 ends in the digit 4 or 9, as expressed by the congruence
formula_37
For instance, the number of partitions for the integer 4 is 5.
For the integer 9, the number of partitions is 30; for 14 there are 135 partitions. This congruence is implied by the more general identity
formula_38
also by Ramanujan, where the notation formula_39 denotes the product defined by
formula_40
A short proof of this result can be obtained from the partition function generating function.

Ramanujan also discovered congruences modulo 7 and 11:
formula_41
The first one comes from Ramanujan&#x27;s identity
formula_42

Since 5, 7, and 11 are consecutive primes, one might think that there would be an analogous congruence for the next prime 13, formula_43 for some . However, there is no congruence of the form formula_44 for any prime &quot;b&quot; other than 5, 7, or 11. Instead, to obtain a congruence, the argument of formula_45 should take the form formula_46 for some formula_47. In the 1960s, A. O. L. Atkin of the University of Illinois at Chicago discovered additional congruences of this form for small prime moduli. For example:
formula_48

 proved that there are such congruences for every prime modulus greater than 3. Later, showed there are partition congruences modulo every integer coprime to 6.

==Approximation formulas==

Approximation formulas exist that are faster to calculate than the exact formula given above.

An asymptotic expression for &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is given by
:formula_49 as formula_50.
This asymptotic formula was first obtained by G. H. Hardy and Ramanujan in 1918 and independently by J. V. Uspensky in 1920. Considering formula_51, the asymptotic formula gives about formula_52, reasonably close to the exact answer given above (1.415% larger than the true value).

Hardy and Ramanujan obtained an asymptotic expansion with this approximation as the first term:
formula_53
where
formula_54
Here, the notation formula_55 means that the sum is taken only over the values of formula_56 that are relatively prime to formula_18. The function formula_58 is a Dedekind sum.

The error after formula_59 terms is of the order of the next term, and formula_59 may be taken to be of the order of formula_61. As an example, Hardy and Ramanujan showed that formula_62 is the nearest integer to the sum of the first formula_63 terms of the series.

In 1937, Hans Rademacher was able to improve on Hardy and Ramanujan&#x27;s results by providing a convergent series expression for formula_12. It is
formula_65

The proof of Rademacher&#x27;s formula involves Ford circles, Farey sequences, modular symmetry and the Dedekind eta function.

It may be shown that the formula_18th term of Rademacher&#x27;s series is of the order
formula_67
so that the first term gives the Hardy–Ramanujan asymptotic approximation.
 published an elementary proof of the asymptotic formula for formula_12.

Techniques for implementing the Hardy–Ramanujan–Rademacher formula efficiently on a computer are discussed by , who shows that formula_12 can be computed in time formula_70 for any formula_71. This is near-optimal in that it matches the number of digits of the result. The largest value of the partition function computed exactly is formula_72, which has slightly more than 11 billion digits.

== Strict partition function ==

=== Definition and properties ===

A partition in which no part occurs more than once is called &quot;strict&quot;, or is said to be a partition &quot;into distinct parts&quot;. The function &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) gives the number of these strict partitions of the given sum &quot;n&quot;. For example, &quot;q&quot;(3) = 2 because the partitions 3 and 1 + 2 are strict, while the third partition 1 + 1 + 1 of 3 has repeated parts. The number &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is also equal to the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; in which only odd summands are permitted.

=== Generating function ===
The generating function for the numbers &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is given by a simple infinite product:
formula_73
where the notation formula_74 represents the Pochhammer symbol formula_75 From this formula, one may easily obtain the first few terms :
formula_76
This series may also be written in terms of theta functions as
formula_77
where
formula_78
and
formula_79
In comparison, the generating function of the regular partition numbers &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) has this identity with respect to the theta function:
formula_80

=== Identities about strict partition numbers ===
Following identity is valid for the Pochhammer products:

: formula_81

From this identity follows that formula:

: formula_82

Therefore those two formulas are valid for the synthesis of the number sequence p(n):

: formula_83
: formula_84

In the following, two examples are accurately executed:

: formula_85
: formula_86
: formula_87
: formula_88
: formula_89
: formula_90

== Restricted partition function ==

More generally, it is possible to consider partitions restricted to only elements of a subset &quot;A&quot; of the natural numbers (for example a restriction on the maximum value of the parts), or with a restriction on the number of parts or the maximum difference between parts. Each particular restriction gives rise to an associated partition function with specific properties. Some common examples are given below.

=== Euler and Glaisher&#x27;s theorem ===

Two important examples are the partitions restricted to only odd integer parts or only even integer parts, with the corresponding partition functions often denoted formula_91 and formula_92.

A theorem from Euler shows that the number of strict partitions is equal to the number of partitions with only odd parts: for all &quot;n&quot;, formula_93. This is generalized as Glaisher&#x27;s theorem, which states that the number of partitions with no more than &quot;d-1&quot; repetitions of any part is equal to the number of partitions with no part divisible by &quot;d&quot;.

=== Gaussian binomial coefficient ===

If we denote formula_94 the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; in at most &quot;M&quot; parts, with each part smaller or equal to &quot;N&quot;, then the generating function of formula_94 is the following Gaussian binomial coefficient:

:formula_96

=== Asymptotics ===

Some general results on the asymptotic properties of restricted partition functions are known. If &quot;p&quot;&quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the partition function of partitions restricted to only elements of a subset &quot;A&quot; of the natural numbers, then:

If &quot;A&quot; possesses positive natural density α then formula_97, with formula_98

and conversely if this asymptotic property holds for &quot;p&quot;&quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) then &quot;A&quot; has natural density α. This result was stated, with a sketch of proof, by Erdős in 1942.

If &quot;A&quot; is a finite set, this analysis does not apply (the density of a finite set is zero). If &quot;A&quot; has &quot;k&quot; elements whose greatest common divisor is 1, then

<text>George Alexander Trebek (; July 22, 1940 – November 8, 2020) was a Canadian and American game show host and television personality. He was best known for hosting the syndicated general knowledge quiz game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; for 37 seasons from its revival in 1984 until his death in 2020. Trebek also hosted a number of other game shows, including &quot;The Wizard of Odds&quot;, &quot;Double Dare&quot;, &quot;High Rollers&quot;, &quot;Battlestars&quot;, &quot;Classic Concentration&quot;, and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He also made appearances, usually as himself, in numerous films and television series.

A native of Canada, Trebek became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1998. For his work on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Trebek received the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host eight times. He died on November 8, 2020, at the age of 80, after a 20-month battle with stage IV pancreatic cancer. At the time of his death, Trebek had been contracted to host &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; until 2022.

==Early life==
Trebek was born on July 22, 1940, in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, the son of George Edward Trebek (born Terebeychuk, ), a chef who had emigrated from Ukraine as a child, and Lucille Marie Lagacé (April 14, 1921 – 2016), a Franco-Ontarian. Trebek had roots in Renfrew County, Ontario, where his maternal grandmother was born in Mount St. Patrick near Renfrew. Trebek grew up in a bilingual French-English household. He was almost expelled from boarding school. Shortly after, Trebek attended a military college in Quebec but dropped out when he was asked to cut his hair. Trebek&#x27;s first job at age 13 was as a bellhop at the hotel where his father worked as a chef. Trebek attended Sudbury High School (now Sudbury Secondary School) and then attended the University of Ottawa. He graduated from the University of Ottawa with a degree in philosophy in 1961. While a university student, Trebek was a member of the English Debating Society. At the time, he was interested in a broadcast news career.

==Broadcasting career==
===CBC===
Before completing his degree, Trebek began his career in 1961 working for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. According to Trebek, &quot;I went to school in the mornings and worked at nights; I did everything, at one time replacing every announcer in every possible job.&quot; He would eventually read the CBC national radio news and cover a wide range of special events for CBC Radio and CBC Television, including curling and horse racing.

Trebek&#x27;s first hosting job was on a Canadian music program called &quot;Music Hop&quot; in 1963. In 1966, he hosted a high school quiz show called &quot;Reach for the Top&quot;. From 1967 to 1970, Trebek was a host for the CBC, introducing classical music programs including performances by Glenn Gould. For one or two seasons, he hosted a weekly skating program. Starting on April 1, 1969, Trebek also hosted &quot;Strategy&quot;, a weekday afternoon game show. From 1971 until the end of 1972, he hosted &quot;I&#x27;m Here Til 9&quot;, the local morning drive radio show on CBC Toronto.

In 1971, Trebek was one of several to have been shortlisted to succeed Ward Cornell as host of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. Although Trebek was the preferred choice of executive producer Ralph Mellanby, based on his audition and other CBC roles, Mellanby stated in 2020 that he ultimately chose Dave Hodge instead, because his boss did not want someone with a mustache to host &quot;Hockey Night&quot;.

===Game shows===

In 1973, Trebek moved to the United States and worked for NBC as host of a new game show, &quot;The Wizard of Odds.&quot; A year later Trebek hosted the popular Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley game show &quot;High Rollers,&quot; which had two incarnations on NBC (1974–76 and 1978–80) and an accompanying syndicated season (1975–76). In between stints as host of &quot;High Rollers,&quot; Trebek hosted the short-lived CBS game show &quot;Double Dare&quot; (not to be confused with the 1986 Nickelodeon game show of the same name). &quot;Double Dare&quot; turned out to be Trebek&#x27;s only game show with the CBS network (he returned there in 1994 to host the Pillsbury Bake-Off until 1998), and the first show he hosted for what was then Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, as well as the second season of the syndicated series &quot;The $128,000 Question,&quot; which was recorded in Toronto.

Since the second incarnation of &quot;High Rollers&quot; premiered while &quot;The $128,000 Question&quot; was still airing and taping episodes, Trebek became one of two hosts to emcee shows in both the United States and Canada, joining Jim Perry, who was hosting &quot;Definition&quot; and &quot;Headline Hunters&quot; in Canada and &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, which coincidentally premiered the same day as &quot;High Rollers&quot; in 1978 in the United States. Trebek&#x27;s francophone side was put on display in 1978, in a special bilingual edition of &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; and its Radio-Canada equivalent, &quot;Génies en herbe.&quot; In this show, Trebek alternated smoothly between French and English throughout.

Like other hosts of the day, Trebek made several guest appearances as a panelist or player on other shows. One of his guest appearances was on a special week of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Card Sharks&quot; in 1980. Trebek and several other game show hosts (Allen Ludden, Bill Cullen, Wink Martindale, Jack Clark, Tom Kennedy, Gene Rayburn, and Jim Lange) competed in a 3-week-long round-robin tournament for charity. Trebek won the tournament, defeating Cullen in the finals. Trebek also appeared as a celebrity teammate on the NBC game show &quot;The Magnificent Marble Machine&quot; in 1975, and the Tom Kennedy-hosted NBC word game &quot;To Say the Least&quot; in 1978. Both of those shows were produced by Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley Productions, which also produced &quot;High Rollers,&quot; the show Trebek was hosting during both of those guest appearances. Trebek also was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot; in 1976, teamed with Jim McKrell. The duo won their match against Dick Gautier and Scatman Crothers.

After &quot;High Rollers&quot; was cancelled in 1980, Trebek moved on to &quot;Battlestars&quot; for NBC. The series debuted in October 1981 and was cancelled in April 1982 after only six months on the air. In September 1981, Trebek took the helm of the syndicated &quot;Pitfall&quot;, which taped in Vancouver and forced him to commute, as Trebek had done while hosting &quot;High Rollers&quot; and &quot;The $128,000 Question&quot; in 1978. &quot;Pitfall&quot; was cancelled after its production company, Catalena Productions, went bankrupt. As a result, Trebek was never paid for that series. After both series ended, he hosted a revival of &quot;Battlestars&quot; called &quot;The New Battlestars&quot; that ended after 13 weeks, then shot a series of pilots for other series for producer Merrill Heatter, for whom he had worked hosting &quot;High Rollers&quot; and &quot;Battlestars&quot;, and Merv Griffin. The Heatter pilots were &quot;Malcolm&quot;, an NBC-ordered pilot featuring Trebek with an animated character as his co-host, and &quot;Lucky Numbers,&quot; an attempt at a revival of &quot;High Rollers&quot; that failed to sell. For Griffin, (who was ultimately encouraged to hire Trebek by Lucille Ball) he shot two pilots for a revival of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; when original host Art Fleming (a friend of Trebek&#x27;s) declined to return to the role owing to creative differences. This revival sold, and Trebek began hosting it in 1984 and remained the host until his death in 2020. His final episode hosting &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; was to air on Christmas Day 2020; however, Sony announced on November 23, 2020, that the air dates of Trebek&#x27;s final week would be postponed, with episodes scheduled for the week of December 21–25 being postponed to January 4–8, 2021, due to the delay caused by the cancellation of most November production dates and pre-emptions caused by holiday week specials and shorts.

Following Trebek&#x27;s death, a series of guest hosts filled in for Trebek for the remainder of season 37 of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; (his final season). On July 27, 2022, it was announced that Mayim Bialik and Ken Jennings would succeed Trebek as the permanent hosts of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; after alternating in multi-week stints for the remainder of the show&#x27;s 38th season after Mike Richards (the show&#x27;s then-executive producer who briefly succeeded Trebek as host of the program) was let go after taping a week&#x27;s worth of episodes after various controversies came to light.

In 1987, while still hosting &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Trebek returned to daytime television as host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Classic Concentration&quot;, his second show for Mark Goodson. Trebek hosted both shows simultaneously until September 20, 1991, when &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; aired its final first-run episode (NBC would air repeats until 1993). In 1991, he made broadcast history by becoming the first person to host three American game shows at the same time, earning this distinction on February 4, 1991, when Trebek took over from Lynn Swann as host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; for Goodson-Todman, which Trebek hosted until the end of the series&#x27; run on May 31, 1991.

In 1994, Trebek returned to the CBS network for the first time since hosting &quot;Double Dare&quot; to host the &quot;Pillsbury Bake-Off&quot;, which he hosted until 1998. Trebek and Pat Sajak, host of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, traded places on April Fools&#x27; Day 1997. Pat Sajak hosted &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and Trebek hosted &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; with Sajak&#x27;s wife, Lesly, as Trebek&#x27;s co-host. Sajak and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; co-host Vanna White played contestants at the wheel, with winnings going toward charities. Trebek appeared on &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot; in 2005 and came in second place in his qualifying game, losing to Cheryl Hines.

On June 24, 2018, Trebek returned as a panelist on the ABC revival of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He hosted a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; primetime special event titled &quot;The Greatest of All Time&quot; on ABC in January 2020, pitting the highest money winners in the show&#x27;s history, Brad Rutter, Ken Jennings, and James Holzhauer, against each other.

===Other appearances===
Trebek made multiple guest appearances on other television shows, ranging from &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in 2008 and 2011 to &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; series finale. In August 1995, during a return to his broadcast-news roots, Trebek filled in for Charles Gibson for a week on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Trebek was also a guest star in season 3 of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, playing one of two &quot;Men in Black&quot; (human agents charged with the supervision of extraterrestrial lifeforms on Earth, hiding their existence from other humans) opposite Jesse Ventura, in the episode &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s From Outer Space&quot;, which first aired on April 12, 1996. On June 13, 2014, Guinness World Records presented Trebek with the world record for most episodes of a game show hosted, with 6,829 episodes at the time. He has also appeared in multiple television commercials.
On October 1, 2018, Trebek moderated the only debate in the Pennsylvania governor&#x27;s race, between Democrat Tom Wolf and Republican Scott Wagner. According to news outlets, he wanted to change the flow of the debate to be more conversational instead of the more traditional format. Trebek dominated the debate and talked for 41% of it, often talking about himself without giving candidates time to discuss their stances on political issues. He also made remarks regarding the sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church. Trebek later apologized for his performance, stating that he was &quot;naive&quot; and &quot;misunderstood&quot; the role of a moderator. &quot;I offer my sincere apologies to the people of Pennsylvania, a state I dearly love,&quot; Trebek said.

Trebek was interviewed by Michael Strahan for an ABC special chronicling &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and his career (produced to promote &quot;Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time&quot;), which aired January 2, 2020.

On October 6, 2020, Trebek made a cameo appearance in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, announcing the Ottawa Senators&#x27; third-overall draft pick, Tim Stützle, in the style of a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; question.

==Personal life==

Trebek married broadcaster Elaine Callei in 1974. They had no children, although Trebek adopted Callei&#x27;s daughter Nicky. The couple divorced in 1981. In 1990, he married Jean Currivan, a real estate project manager from New York. They had two children, Matthew and Emily.

In 1996, Trebek ran the Olympic torch in Jacksonville, Florida, through a leg of its journey to Atlanta. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1998.

On January 30, 2004, Trebek escaped major injury after falling asleep behind the wheel of his pickup truck while driving alone on a rural road in the Central Coast town of Templeton, California, returning from a family home in Lake Nacimiento. The truck sideswiped a string of mailboxes, flew 45 feet over an embankment, and came to rest against a utility pole in a ditch. Trebek was not cited for the accident and returned to work taping &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; four days later.

Trebek owned and managed a 700-acre (283 ha) ranch near Paso Robles in Creston, California, known as Creston Farms, where he bred and trained thoroughbred racehorses. His colt Reba&#x27;s Gold is the stakes-winning son of Slew o&#x27; Gold. Trebek sold the operation in 2008 and the property is now an event center called Windfall Farms.

In a 2018 interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, Trebek said he was a political moderate and registered independent, neither conservative nor liberal, with some libertarian leanings. Trebek stated he believed in God as a Christian. During a 2018 gubernatorial debate, Trebek said that he was raised Catholic during his childhood and adolescence.

===Health===
On December 10, 2007, Trebek experienced a minor heart attack at his home, but returned to work as scheduled in January 2008. Early in the morning on July 26, 2011, Trebek injured his Achilles tendon while chasing a burglar who had entered his San Francisco hotel room, requiring six weeks in a cast. Trebek experienced another mild heart attack on June 23, 2012, but was able to return to work the following month.

On December 15, 2017, over the winter break of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; taping, Trebek was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after reportedly experiencing complications from a fall in October of that year. The incident resulted in a subdural hematoma. Trebek underwent surgery to remove blood clots from his brain the following day. On January 4, 2018, the verified Twitter account of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; announced that Trebek had been suffering from the fall. He required a short medical leave and returned to regular hosting duty in mid-January 2018.

In 2018, while being interviewed by Harvey Levin on Fox News, Trebek floated the idea of retirement, saying the odds of his leaving &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in 2020 were 50/50 &quot;and a little less&quot;. Trebek added that he might continue if he is &quot;not making too many mistakes&quot; but would make an &quot;intelligent decision&quot; as to when he should give up the emcee role. In October 2018, Trebek signed a new contract to continue as host through 2022, stating in January 2019 that although he was beginning to slow down due to his age, the show&#x27;s work schedule, consisting of 46 taping sessions each year, was still manageable.

====Pancreatic cancer and death====
 On March 6, 2019, aged 78, Trebek announced that he had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. He had been experiencing a persistent stomach ache before the diagnosis but did not recognize it as a symptom of the disease. In a prepared video announcement of the diagnosis, Trebek noted that his prognosis was poor but said that he would aggressively fight the cancer in hopes of beating the odds and would continue hosting &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; for as long as he was able, joking that his contract obligated him to do so for three more years. Trebek updated the situation in May 2019, stating that he was responding exceptionally well to treatment and that some of the tumors had shrunk to half their previously observed size; he credited the prayers and well wishes of his fans for the better-than-usual results and planned to undergo several more rounds of chemotherapy. Trebek finished that round of chemotherapy treatments in time to resume taping of the show in August 2019. Follow-up immunotherapy was ineffective, and Trebek resumed chemotherapy in September.

On October4, 2019, in an interview with CTV&#x27;s Chief Anchor and Senior Editor Lisa LaFlamme, Trebek said: &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid of dying&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve lived a good life, a full life, and I&#x27;m nearing the end of that life... [I]f it happens, why should I be afraid [of] that?&quot; In the same interview, Trebek noted that sores in his mouth, a side effect from the chemotherapy, were interfering with his ability to speak, noting that &quot;there will come a point when they (fans and producers) will no longer be able to say, &#x27;It&#x27;s okay.&#x27;&quot; In a December 2019 interview with ABC News, Trebek stated that he would begin looking at experimental treatments and chemotherapies and that despite periods of severe pain and depression, he was still in good enough physical condition to handle construction projects. Trebek also stated that he had already prepared an on-air farewell statement before his cancer diagnosis.

In March 2020, Trebek announced he had survived one year of cancer treatment (noting that his prognosis had given him only an 18% chance to survive that long) and that, though the chemotherapy treatments were often worse than the cancer symptoms themselves, he was confident that he would survive another year, saying that ending treatment would be a &quot;betrayal&quot; to his family, supporters, and to the God in whom he had faith. As a precautionary measure, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; initially taped episodes without a studio audience, as protection from the COVID-19 pandemic; Trebek, because of both his age and his condition, was particularly at risk of death from the particular variant of SARS-CoV-2 circulating. Soon afterward, production of the show was suspended altogether. The show resumed taping in August, in time for the season 37 premiere.

On July 16, 2020, Trebek gave an update regarding his cancer. Trebek said that while he still felt fatigued, the chemotherapy was &quot;paying off.&quot; Trebek also stated that he was looking forward to taping again. On July 21, 2020, Trebek published his memoir: &quot;The Answer Is...: Reflections on My Life&quot;.

Trebek underwent surgery related to his cancer treatment in October. Trebek returned to the show two weeks after the surgery but was unable to handle his full workload due to pain from the surgery and had to split his usual five-episode taping session over two days; these five episodes would be his last. Trebek taped his final episode on October 29, 2020, just 10 days before his death. Ken Jennings was called in to substitute host for Trebek for what was initially expected to be a temporary replacement while Trebek recovered from the surgery on November 8; that same day, Trebek died at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 80, after 20 months fighting pancreatic cancer. It was the same disease that affected his predecessor and the original host of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Art Fleming, who died a little over 25 years earlier. Trebek&#x27;s remains were cremated and his ashes were given to his wife. Trebek&#x27;s estate was liquidated in an estate sale in April 2022 as his daughter prepared to sell his home in Studio City.

====Posthumous recognition====
Shortly after Trebek&#x27;s death, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; contestant and future host Ken Jennings, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White were among those who paid tribute.

On the November 9, 2020, episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, as a tribute to Trebek, then-executive producer of both &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, Mike Richards, visibly emotional, opened the show with this statement:
The lights on the set then dimmed blue in remembrance.

After each posthumous episode in season 37, the title card read, &quot;Dedicated to Alex Trebek. Forever in our hearts. Always our inspiration.&quot;

On the first anniversary of Trebek&#x27;s death, which was also the day that the first episode Ken Jennings hosted in season 38 was aired, a different title card read, &quot;Alex Trebek, July 22, 1940 – November 8, 2020. You are missed every day.&quot; On the second anniversary of his death, Trebek was honored in a category entitled &quot;Remembering Alex Trebek&quot; during the Jeopardy! Round of the 2022 Tournament of Champions special exhibition episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;

Since Trebek&#x27;s death, various television networks aired their own tributes to him such as MeTV (which played &quot;What Is... Cliff Clavin?&quot; and &quot;Mama on Jeopardy!&quot;, two episodes of the classic 1980s sitcoms &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; respectively in which &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; was a plot device), Buzzr (which aired episodes of shows Trebek guest starred in such as &quot;Card Sharks&quot; or hosted such as &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in the Fremantle library) and Game Show Network (which aired a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; marathon). On the premiere episode of the rebooted American version of &quot;The Chase&quot;, where &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champions James Holzhauer, Brad Rutter, and Ken Jennings were chasers, host Sara Haines paid tribute to Trebek at the start of the show.

Trebek&#x27;s final episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; aired on January 8, 2021, concluding with a 90-second tribute to Trebek.

On August 19, 2021, the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; stage was renamed &quot;The Alex Trebek Stage&quot;, with his family present at the dedication.

The United States Postal Service honored Trebek with a commemorative stamp honoring both the 60th anniversary of the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; franchise and Trebek&#x27;s naturalized American citizenship, with the stamp scheduled for release in July 2024.

==Philanthropy and activism==

Trebek was a longtime philanthropist and activist. He was active with multiple charities, including World Vision Canada, United Service Organizations and the United Negro College Fund. For World Vision, Trebek travelled to many developing countries with World Vision projects, taping reports on the group&#x27;s efforts on behalf of children around the world. He and the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; crew became involved with the United Service Organizations in 1995, appearing on several military bases throughout the world, both in an attempt to find contestants and as a morale booster for the troops. While genuinely supportive of the cause throughout his life, Trebek has said that he believes he initially got involved with the UNCF in the 1980s because — due to the afro, mustache and &quot;very dark tan&quot; that he sported at the time — he was often confused for being a Black man and so was invited to take part in the organization&#x27;s telethons.

Trebek also donated 74 acres (30 hectares) of open land in the Hollywood Hills to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in 1998. He was later awarded one of the American Foundation for the Blind&#x27;s six yearly Access Awards for his role in accommodating &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champion Eddie Timanus. Trebek hosted the annual The Great Canadian Geography Challenge in Canada. He hosted the National Geographic Bee in the United States for 25 years, stepping down in 2013. He also served on the advisory board of U.S. English, an organization that supports making English the official language of the United States.

In 2016, Trebek donated $5 million to the University of Ottawa to fund the Alex Trebek Forum for Dialogue, the objective of which is &quot;to expose students to a wide range of diverse views, through speeches, public panels, events and lectures by University of Ottawa researchers, senior government officials and guests speakers from around the world.&quot; His gifts to the university, which at the time totaled $7.5 million, also fund a Distinguished Speaker Series, which has included a presentation by Nobel laureate Leymah Gbowee, introduced by Trebek. In 2017, he funded the Alex Trebek Leadership Award at the University of Ottawa, an annual $10,000 award to a &quot;summa cum laude&quot; graduate who has also demonstrated community leadership. By October 2020, Trebek&#x27;s contributions to the University of Ottawa totalled around $10 million.

In March 2020, Trebek donated $100,000 to Hope of the Valley Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter in Los Angeles.

Trebek owned his own wardrobe, consisting of dozens of outfits and hundreds of neckties. In February 2021, Trebek&#x27;s son, Matthew, donated the wardrobe to The Doe Fund, in keeping with a statement Trebek had made on his last day of taping.

==Awards and honors==
In 1997, Trebek was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of the university (D.Univ) from the University of Ottawa. In addition to awards for &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, he received a great deal of recognition. Trebek received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. He was also awarded eight Outstanding Game Show Host Emmy Awards (1989, 1990, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2019, 2020, and 2021) and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (located at 6501 Hollywood Boulevard, near those for Ann-Margret and Vincent Price).
On November 4, 2010, Trebek received the Royal Canadian Geographical Society&#x27;s gold medal for his contribution to geographic education and the popular study of geography. Previous recipients of this award include the author and anthropologist Wade Davis (2009), Peter Gzowski (1997), and Mary May Simon (1998). In 2016, Trebek was named the Honorary President of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society; in that capacity, he was present at the opening of the RCGS&#x27;s new headquarters in 2018.

In 2011, it was announced that Trebek would be one of the recipients of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Daytime Emmy Awards. That same year, he received an Honorary Doctorate from Fordham University. Since June 13, 2014, Trebek has held a Guinness World Record for &quot;the most game show episodes hosted by the same presenter (same program)&quot; for having hosted 6,829 episodes of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, overtaking previous record holder Bob Barker.
On May 4, 2015, Trebek&#x27;s alma mater, the University of Ottawa, named its alumni hall in his honor, as a benefactor to the university.

In May 2016, Trebek was given the Key to the City by the City of Ottawa. On June 30, 2017, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada by then-Governor General David Johnston for &quot;his iconic achievements in television and for his promotion of learning, notably as a champion for geographical literacy.&quot; On June 28, 2019, Trebek was awarded the 2019 Americanism Award by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

On January 7, 2020, Trebek was awarded along with his wife Jean, the Fordham Founder&#x27;s Award at Fordham University.

In December 2019, Trebek was named the winner of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television&#x27;s Icon Award for the 8th Canadian Screen Awards in 2020. Although the ceremony was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the award was presented to Trebek in a recorded acceptance speech, which the academy released to social media platforms in January 2021 to coincide with the broadcast of Trebek&#x27;s last episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;

In July 2021, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and the National Geographical Society announced a grant program called The Trebek Initiative, whose goal is to promote emerging Canadian explorers, scientists, educators and photographers. A month later, artist Kevin Ledo created a mural memorializing Trebek on the outer wall of Sudbury Secondary School, where Trebek had attended high school, as part of the Up Here Festival.

On August 19, 2021, prior to the start of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; season 38 taping, Sony Pictures Studios sound stage Studio 10 was officially renamed as &quot;The Alex Trebek Stage&quot;.

On September 29, 2022, Trebek was posthumously inducted into the inaugural class of the &quot;Jeopardy! Hall of Fame&quot; at the first &quot;Jeopardy! Honors&quot; event. His widow, Jean, accepted the award on his behalf.

On June 21, 2024, the U.S. Postal Service announced that it will issue a first-class Forever stamp honoring Trebek, set for release on July 22, 2024. The stamp&#x27;s design is in the form of a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;-style question.

<doc id="312252" wikidata="Q230963" url="?curid=312252" title="Partition function (statistical mechanics)">
<text>In physics, a partition function describes the statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Partition functions are functions of the thermodynamic state variables, such as the temperature and volume. Most of the aggregate thermodynamic variables of the system, such as the total energy, free energy, entropy, and pressure, can be expressed in terms of the partition function or its derivatives. The partition function is dimensionless.

Each partition function is constructed to represent a particular statistical ensemble (which, in turn, corresponds to a particular free energy). The most common statistical ensembles have named partition functions. The canonical partition function applies to a canonical ensemble, in which the system is allowed to exchange heat with the environment at fixed temperature, volume, and number of particles. The grand canonical partition function applies to a grand canonical ensemble, in which the system can exchange both heat and particles with the environment, at fixed temperature, volume, and chemical potential. Other types of partition functions can be defined for different circumstances; see partition function (mathematics) for generalizations. The partition function has many physical meanings, as discussed in Meaning and significance.

== Canonical partition function ==

=== Definition ===
Initially, let us assume that a thermodynamically large system is in thermal contact with the environment, with a temperature &quot;T&quot;, and both the volume of the system and the number of constituent particles are fixed. A collection of this kind of system comprises an ensemble called a canonical ensemble. The appropriate mathematical expression for the canonical partition function depends on the degrees of freedom of the system, whether the context is classical mechanics or quantum mechanics, and whether the spectrum of states is discrete or continuous.

==== Classical discrete system ====

For a canonical ensemble that is classical and discrete, the canonical partition function is defined as
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the index for the microstates of the system;
* formula_3 is Euler&#x27;s number;
* formula_4 is the thermodynamic beta, defined as formula_5 where formula_6 is the Boltzmann constant;
* formula_7 is the total energy of the system in the respective microstate.

The exponential factor formula_8 is otherwise known as the Boltzmann factor.

 \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain formula_9, one substitutes the probability into the first constraint:
formula_10
where formula_11 is a number defined as the canonical ensemble partition function:
formula_12

Isolating for formula_9 yields formula_14.

Rewriting formula_15 in terms of formula_11 gives
formula_17

Rewriting formula_18 in terms of formula_11 gives
formula_20

To obtain formula_21, we differentiate formula_18 with respect to the average energy formula_23 and apply the first law of thermodynamics, formula_24:
formula_25

(Note that formula_21 and formula_11 vary with formula_23 as well; however, using the chain rule and
formula_29
one can show that the additional contributions to this derivative cancel each other.)

Thus the canonical partition function formula_11 becomes
formula_31
where formula_32 is defined as the thermodynamic beta. Finally, the probability distribution formula_15 and entropy formula_18 are respectively
formula_35

==== Classical continuous system ====

In classical mechanics, the position and momentum variables of a particle can vary continuously, so the set of microstates is actually uncountable. In &quot;classical&quot; statistical mechanics, it is rather inaccurate to express the partition function as a sum of discrete terms. In this case we must describe the partition function using an integral rather than a sum. For a canonical ensemble that is classical and continuous, the canonical partition function is defined as
formula_36
where
* formula_37 is the Planck constant;
* formula_4 is the thermodynamic beta, defined as formula_5;
* formula_40 is the Hamiltonian of the system;
* formula_41 is the canonical position;
* formula_42 is the canonical momentum.

To make it into a dimensionless quantity, we must divide it by &quot;h&quot;, which is some quantity with units of action (usually taken to be the Planck constant).

==== Classical continuous system (multiple identical particles) ====

For a gas of formula_43 identical classical non-interacting particles in three dimensions, the partition function is
formula_44
where
* formula_37 is the Planck constant;
* formula_4 is the thermodynamic beta, defined as formula_5;
* formula_2 is the index for the particles of the system;
* formula_49 is the Hamiltonian of a respective particle;
* formula_50 is the canonical position of the respective particle;
* formula_51 is the canonical momentum of the respective particle;
* formula_52 is shorthand notation to indicate that formula_50 and formula_51 are vectors in three-dimensional space.
* formula_55 is the classical continuous partition function of a single particle as given in the previous section.

The reason for the factorial factor &quot;N&quot;! is discussed below. The extra constant factor introduced in the denominator was introduced because, unlike the discrete form, the continuous form shown above is not dimensionless. As stated in the previous section, to make it into a dimensionless quantity, we must divide it by &quot;h&quot;3&quot;N&quot; (where &quot;h&quot; is usually taken to be the Planck constant).

==== Quantum mechanical discrete system ====

For a canonical ensemble that is quantum mechanical and discrete, the canonical partition function is defined as the trace of the Boltzmann factor:
formula_56
where:
* formula_57 is the trace of a matrix;
* formula_4 is the thermodynamic beta, defined as formula_5;
* formula_60 is the Hamiltonian operator.

The dimension of formula_61 is the number of energy eigenstates of the system.

==== Quantum mechanical continuous system ====

For a canonical ensemble that is quantum mechanical and continuous, the canonical partition function is defined as
formula_62
where:
* formula_37 is the Planck constant;
* formula_4 is the thermodynamic beta, defined as formula_5;
* formula_60 is the Hamiltonian operator;
* formula_41 is the canonical position;
* formula_42 is the canonical momentum.

In systems with multiple quantum states &quot;s&quot; sharing the same energy &quot;Es&quot;, it is said that the energy levels of the system are degenerate. In the case of degenerate energy levels, we can write the partition function in terms of the contribution from energy levels (indexed by &quot;j&quot;) as follows:
formula_69
where &quot;gj&quot; is the degeneracy factor, or number of quantum states &quot;s&quot; that have the same energy level defined by &quot;Ej&quot; = &quot;Es&quot;.

The above treatment applies to &quot;quantum&quot; statistical mechanics, where a physical system inside a finite-sized box will typically have a discrete set of energy eigenstates, which we can use as the states &quot;s&quot; above. In quantum mechanics, the partition function can be more formally written as a trace over the state space (which is independent of the choice of basis):
formula_70
where is the quantum Hamiltonian operator. The exponential of an operator can be defined using the exponential power series.

The classical form of &quot;Z&quot; is recovered when the trace is expressed in terms of coherent states and when quantum-mechanical uncertainties in the position and momentum of a particle are regarded as negligible. Formally, using bra–ket notation, one inserts under the trace for each degree of freedom the identity:
formula_71
where is a normalised Gaussian wavepacket centered at position &quot;x&quot; and momentum &quot;p&quot;. Thus
formula_72
A coherent state is an approximate eigenstate of both operators formula_73 and formula_74, hence also of the Hamiltonian , with errors of the size of the uncertainties. If and can be regarded as zero, the action of reduces to multiplication by the classical Hamiltonian, and reduces to the classical configuration integral.

=== Connection to probability theory ===

For simplicity, we will use the discrete form of the partition function in this section. Our results will apply equally well to the continuous form.

Consider a system &quot;S&quot; embedded into a heat bath &quot;B&quot;. Let the total energy of both systems be &quot;E&quot;. Let &quot;pi&quot; denote the probability that the system &quot;S&quot; is in a particular microstate, &quot;i&quot;, with energy &quot;Ei&quot;. According to the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics (which states that all attainable microstates of a system are equally probable), the probability &quot;pi&quot; will be inversely proportional to the number of microstates of the total closed system (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) in which &quot;S&quot; is in microstate &quot;i&quot; with energy &quot;Ei&quot;. Equivalently, &quot;pi&quot; will be proportional to the number of microstates of the heat bath &quot;B&quot; with energy :
formula_75

Assuming that the heat bath&#x27;s internal energy is much larger than the energy of &quot;S&quot; (), we can Taylor-expand formula_76 to first order in &quot;Ei&quot; and use the thermodynamic relation formula_77, where here formula_78, formula_79 are the entropy and temperature of the bath respectively:
formula_80

Thus
formula_81

Since the total probability to find the system in &quot;some&quot; microstate (the sum of all &quot;pi&quot;) must be equal to 1, we know that the constant of proportionality must be the normalization constant, and so, we can define the partition function to be this constant:
formula_82

=== Calculating the thermodynamic total energy ===

In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the partition function, let us calculate the thermodynamic value of the total energy. This is simply the expected value, or ensemble average for the energy, which is the sum of the microstate energies weighted by their probabilities:
formula_83
or, equivalently,
formula_84

Incidentally, one should note that if the microstate energies depend on a parameter λ in the manner
formula_85
then the expected value of &quot;A&quot; is
formula_86

This provides us with a method for calculating the expected values of many microscopic quantities. We add the quantity artificially to the microstate energies (or, in the language of quantum mechanics, to the Hamiltonian), calculate the new partition function and expected value, and then set &quot;λ&quot; to zero in the final expression. This is analogous to the source field method used in the path integral formulation of quantum field theory.

=== Relation to thermodynamic variables ===

In this section, we will state the relationships between the partition function and the various thermodynamic parameters of the system. These results can be derived using the method of the previous section and the various thermodynamic relations.

As we have already seen, the thermodynamic energy is
formula_87

The variance in the energy (or &quot;energy fluctuation&quot;) is
formula_88

The heat capacity is
formula_89

In general, consider the extensive variable &quot;X&quot; and intensive variable &quot;Y&quot; where &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; form a pair of conjugate variables. In ensembles where &quot;Y&quot; is fixed (and &quot;X&quot; is allowed to fluctuate), then the average value of &quot;X&quot; will be:
formula_90

The sign will depend on the specific definitions of the variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. An example would be &quot;X&quot; = volume and &quot;Y&quot; = pressure. Additionally, the variance in &quot;X&quot; will be
formula_91

In the special case of entropy, entropy is given by
formula_92
where &quot;A&quot; is the Helmholtz free energy defined as , where is the total energy and &quot;S&quot; is the entropy, so that
formula_93

Furthermore, the heat capacity can be expressed as
formula_94

=== Partition functions of subsystems ===

Suppose a system is subdivided into &quot;N&quot; sub-systems with negligible interaction energy, that is, we can assume the particles are essentially non-interacting. If the partition functions of the sub-systems are &quot;ζ&quot;1, &quot;ζ&quot;2, ..., &quot;ζ&quot;N, then the partition function of the entire system is the &quot;product&quot; of the individual partition functions:
formula_95

If the sub-systems have the same physical properties, then their partition functions are equal, &quot;ζ&quot;1 = &quot;ζ&quot;2 = ... = &quot;ζ&quot;, in which case formula_96

However, there is a well-known exception to this rule. If the sub-systems are actually identical particles, in the quantum mechanical sense that they are impossible to distinguish even in principle, the total partition function must be divided by a &quot;N&quot;! (&quot;N&quot; factorial):
formula_97

This is to ensure that we do not &quot;over-count&quot; the number of microstates. While this may seem like a strange requirement, it is actually necessary to preserve the existence of a thermodynamic limit for such systems. This is known as the Gibbs paradox.

=== Meaning and significance ===

It may not be obvious why the partition function, as we have defined it above, is an important quantity. First, consider what goes into it. The partition function is a function of the temperature &quot;T&quot; and the microstate energies &quot;E&quot;1, &quot;E&quot;2, &quot;E&quot;3, etc. The microstate energies are determined by other thermodynamic variables, such as the number of particles and the volume, as well as microscopic quantities like the mass of the constituent particles. This dependence on microscopic variables is the central point of statistical mechanics. With a model of the microscopic constituents of a system, one can calculate the microstate energies, and thus the partition function, which will then allow us to calculate all the other thermodynamic properties of the system.

The partition function can be related to thermodynamic properties because it has a very important statistical meaning. The probability &quot;Ps&quot; that the system occupies microstate &quot;s&quot; is
formula_98

Thus, as shown above, the partition function plays the role of a normalizing constant (note that it does &quot;not&quot; depend on &quot;s&quot;), ensuring that the probabilities sum up to one:
formula_99

This is the reason for calling &quot;Z&quot; the &quot;partition function&quot;: it encodes how the probabilities are partitioned among the different microstates, based on their individual energies. Other partition functions for different ensembles divide up the probabilities based on other macrostate variables. As an example: the partition function for the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, the generalized Boltzmann distribution, divides up probabilities based on particle number, pressure, and temperature. The energy is replaced by the characteristic potential of that ensemble, the Gibbs Free Energy. The letter &quot;Z&quot; stands for the German word &quot;Zustandssumme&quot;, &quot;sum over states&quot;. The usefulness of the partition function stems from the fact that the macroscopic thermodynamic quantities of a system can be related to its microscopic details through the derivatives of its partition function. Finding the partition function is also equivalent to performing a Laplace transform of the density of states function from the energy domain to the &quot;β&quot; domain, and the inverse Laplace transform of the partition function reclaims the state density function of energies.

== Grand canonical partition function ==
We can define a grand canonical partition function for a grand canonical ensemble, which describes the statistics of a constant-volume system that can exchange both heat and particles with a reservoir. The reservoir has a constant temperature &quot;T&quot;, and a chemical potential &quot;μ&quot;.

The grand canonical partition function, denoted by formula_100, is the following sum over microstates
: formula_101
Here, each microstate is labelled by formula_102, and has total particle number formula_103 and total energy formula_104. This partition function is closely related to the grand potential, formula_105, by the relation
: formula_106
This can be contrasted to the canonical partition function above, which is related instead to the Helmholtz free energy.

It is important to note that the number of microstates in the grand canonical ensemble may be much larger than in the canonical ensemble, since here we consider not only variations in energy but also in particle number. Again, the utility of the grand canonical partition function is that it is related to the probability that the system is in state formula_102:
: formula_108

An important application of the grand canonical ensemble is in deriving exactly the statistics of a non-interacting many-body quantum gas (Fermi–Dirac statistics for fermions, Bose–Einstein statistics for bosons), however it is much more generally applicable than that. The grand canonical ensemble may also be used to describe classical systems, or even interacting quantum gases.

The grand partition function is sometimes written (equivalently) in terms of alternate variables as
: formula_109
where formula_110 is known as the absolute activity (or fugacity) and formula_111 is the canonical partition function.

<text>In quantum field theory, partition functions are generating functionals for correlation functions, making them key objects of study in the path integral formalism. They are the imaginary time versions of statistical mechanics partition functions, giving rise to a close connection between these two areas of physics. Partition functions can rarely be solved for exactly, although free theories do admit such solutions. Instead, a perturbative approach is usually implemented, this being equivalent to summing over Feynman diagrams.

== Generating functional ==

=== Scalar theories ===

In a formula_1-dimensional field theory with a real scalar field formula_2 and action formula_3, the partition function is defined in the path integral formalism as the functional

:formula_4

where formula_5 is a fictitious source current. It acts as a generating functional for arbitrary n-point correlation functions

:formula_6

The derivatives used here are functional derivatives rather than regular derivatives since they are acting on functionals rather than regular functions. From this it follows that an equivalent expression for the partition function reminiscent to a power series in source currents is given by

:formula_7

In curved spacetimes there is an added subtlety that must be dealt with due to the fact that the initial vacuum state need not be the same as the final vacuum state. Partition functions can also be constructed for composite operators in the same way as they are for fundamental fields. Correlation functions of these operators can then be calculated as functional derivatives of these functionals. For example, the partition function for a composite operator formula_8 is given by

:formula_9

Knowing the partition function completely solves the theory since it allows for the direct calculation of all of its correlation functions. However, there are very few cases where the partition function can be calculated exactly. While free theories do admit exact solutions, interacting theories generally do not. Instead the partition function can be evaluated at weak coupling perturbatively, which amounts to regular perturbation theory using Feynman diagrams with formula_10 insertions on the external legs. The symmetry factors for these types of diagrams differ from those of correlation functions since all external legs have identical formula_10 insertions that can be interchanged, whereas the external legs of correlation functions are all fixed at specific coordinates and are therefore fixed.

By performing a Wick transformation, the partition function can be expressed in Euclidean spacetime as

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the Euclidean action and formula_14 are Euclidean coordinates. This form is closely connected to the partition function in statistical mechanics, especially since the Euclidean Lagrangian is usually bounded from below in which case it can be interpreted as an energy density. It also allows for the interpretation of the exponential factor as a statistical weight for the field configurations, with larger fluctuations in the gradient or field values leading to greater suppression. This connection with statistical mechanics also lends additional intuition for how correlation functions should behave in a quantum field theory.

=== General theories ===

Most of the same principles of the scalar case hold for more general theories with additional fields. Each field requires the introduction of its own fictitious current, with antiparticle fields requiring their own separate currents. Acting on the partition function with a derivative of a current brings down its associated field from the exponential, allowing for the construction of arbitrary correlation functions. After differentiation, the currents are set to zero when correlation functions in a vacuum state are desired, but the currents can also be set to take on particular values to yield correlation functions in non-vanishing background fields.

For partition functions with Grassmann valued fermion fields, the sources are also Grassmann valued. For example, a theory with a single Dirac fermion formula_15 requires the introduction of two Grassmann currents formula_16 and formula_17 so that the partition function is

:formula_18

Functional derivatives with respect to formula_17 give fermion fields while derivatives with respect to formula_16 give anti-fermion fields in the correlation functions.

=== Thermal field theories ===

A thermal field theory at temperature formula_21 is equivalent in Euclidean formalism to a theory with a compactified temporal direction of length formula_22. Partition functions must be modified appropriately by imposing periodicity conditions on the fields and the Euclidean spacetime integrals

:formula_23

This partition function can be taken as the definition of the thermal field theory in imaginary time formalism. Correlation functions are acquired from the partition function through the usual functional derivatives with respect to currents

:formula_24

== Free theories ==

The partition function can be solved exactly in free theories by completing the square in terms of the fields. Since a shift by a constant does not affect the path integral measure, this allows for separating the partition function into a constant of proportionality formula_25 arising from the path integral, and a second term that only depends on the current. For the scalar theory this yields

:formula_26

where formula_27 is the position space Feynman propagator

:formula_28

This partition function fully determines the free field theory.

In the case of a theory with a single free Dirac fermion, completing the square yields a partition function of the form

:formula_29

where formula_30 is the position space Dirac propagator

:formula_31

<doc id="312258" wikidata="Q16999179" url="?curid=312258" title="Moral support">
<text>Moral support is a way of giving support to a person or cause, or to one side in a conflict, without making any contribution beyond the emotional or psychological value of the encouragement by supporting them.

For example, in a war between two countries or alliances, a third nation may give moral support to one side, without actually participating in the conflict (for example, Paraguay in World War II).

Another common example can be found in sports. By coming out to watch one&#x27;s friend&#x27;s team play a match, one is likely not directly supporting their team in any significant way, but one&#x27;s friend may still feel encouraged by the moral support of one&#x27;s presence.

The line between moral support and other forms of help is often hard to draw. For example, some athletes report that they play better when the spectators encourage them—and in some cases referees&#x27; decisions may be influenced by a partisan crowd.

There is also moral support that one can offer someone who is experiencing a difficult situation. One may not be able to offer any concrete assistance except empathy.

There are several key terms relating to the premise of moral support. One is the term &quot;moral&quot;, which is defined as partaking in actions considered ethical or proper, and being the distinction between &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; (APA Dictionary ). Humans are all &quot;morally motivated&quot; and guided by a moral code, which is defined as the ethical values or principles that people use to guide their behaviour (APA Dictionary). An individual&#x27;s morals and moral code are influenced by culture (Haidt 2007 ). Morality itself is said to be universal among humans (Haidt 2007 ).

&quot;Moral support&quot; is a term commonly used in popular culture. There is no formal definition of the term &quot;moral support&quot; in the psychological literature, nor is there a formalised or operationalised way to measure it. Whilst there is not much in the literature explicitly examining the topic of moral support as a subject, a lot of the literature contains discussions of topics closely related to moral support. These topics, themes and definitions, although not named as such, would amount to a direct acknowledgment of the existence of moral support.

==Theoretical basis==
The morals a person has as an adult, come as a direct product of their moral development. Literature surrounding this field of study occasionally refers to moral support in the context of parents aiding their children in making moral decisions (Turiel 1983). From an early age, humans are able to intuitively identify a morally charged situation from a more mundane one, as explained by Social Domain Theory (Turiel 1983 ). These ‘unique’ moral situations may require a different kind of approach or even assistance in order to be dealt with; this is when moral support can be required.

Humans are highly social. Our cultures demand conformity (Asch 1951) to certain societal norms, such as conforming to moral codes and pressures. When deciding between the &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;right&quot; decisions, a person may need emotional support, or approval from another peer in the form of moral support.

Moral support can come in the form of influence by norms and role models (Aquino and Freeman ). A person&#x27;s surrounding environment can influence the extent to which the decisions they make are &quot;moral&quot;. This depends on the person&#x27;s moral identity, and whether or not they consider being a moral person as an important part of their identity. In an environment where the expression of moral identities, constructs and concerns is common and overt, people that value morals highly within their identity experience reinforcement of their own moral identity. Individuals that would ordinarily assign low importance to their morals, may experience a &quot;temporary moral identity&quot; which will influence the way in which they make a moral decision. Those with high importance moral identities gained moral support from this environment, which is why they experience this reinforcement of identity. Those with low importance moral identities experience this temporary moral identity, because their environment provides them with moral support and insight when making a morally charged decision, leading to more moral behaviour.

Furthermore, the Social Information Processing (Crick and Dodge, 1994 ) in conjunction with Moral Decision-Making Framework (Garrigan, Adlam, Langdon 2018 ) shows how in a morally charged situation, a proximal decision is made by following a set of internalised cues, before a behaviour in enacted. The framework shows how these internal cues take into consideration social factors, most notably peer interaction, parenting and culture. This supports the idea that we look, even if subconsciously, to others for moral support when making moral decisions.

==Applications of moral support==
===In purchase decisions===
The role of moral support has also been identified as a key player in consumer behaviour (Lowe and Haws 2014 ). This research explicitly relates self-control to moral behaviour. The study examines identical purchasing decisions made by two different people. An example of buying some food for consumption is used. If the two people both decided to buy the food this is known as &quot;co-indulgence&quot;; if the two people both decide to abstain from making the purchase this is known as &quot;co-abstinence&quot;. In a third situation, one person decides to purchase the food, while the other does not.

Guilt is an important underlying element in this study. The purchasing decisions are described as being &quot;self-control&quot; decisions. If the decision to buy the food prevents progress of a goal, for example maintaining a healthy diet, and the person chooses to make the purchase regardless of this, then the feeling of guilt will taint the overall experience and enjoyment of the purchase. In the case of the third example, when one party indulged and the other abstained, the person who made the purchase displayed more feelings of guilt and enjoyed the purchase least out of all the scenarios. If both parties however made the &#x27;wrong&#x27; decision together in purchasing the item, much less guilt was displayed.

Consumers often use guilt management strategie to permit contradictory behaviour (Gregory-Smtih, Smith, Winklhofer 2013 ). Peer compliance reduces guilt, and this manifests itself as moral support. The guilt is felt when the person feels they have substantially ruptured their morals, by doing the &quot;wrong&quot; thing and making the purchase. However, if both persons make the indulgent purchase, the feelings of guilt are greatly lessened and enjoyment is bolstered because there is a feeling of solidarity in this &quot;wrong&quot; choice. Similarly, if both consumers chose to abstain and do the &quot;right&quot; thing, this moral support of each other was seen to bond the two parties. See Social Approval.

The Lowe and Haws study demonstrates that moral support is a highly social and emotional phenomenon.

===In therapy===
A study conducted by Pfund et al. (2020) found sending a motivational letter to patients needing psychological treatment for gambling disorders increased the rate of first therapy session attendance. The control group received a reminder phone call only before their first session, but no motivational letter. The experimental condition group received the phone call and the letter; attendance from this group was 25% higher. (Control group has 51% attendance, motivational letter group had 76%). The motivational letter, which highlighted the expected outcomes of the therapy for the participant, is a form of successful moral support as it gives emotional support and prompts the individual to do the ‘right’ thing and follow through with treatment.

<doc id="312259" wikidata="Q750176" url="?curid=312259" title="Chinampa">
<text>Chinampa ( ) is a technique used in Mesoamerican agriculture which relies on small, rectangular areas of fertile arable land to grow crops on the shallow lake beds in the Valley of Mexico. The word chinampa has Nahuatl origins, chinampa meaning “in the fence of reeds”. They are built up on wetlands of a lake or freshwater swamp for agricultural purposes, and their proportions ensure optimal moisture retention. This method was also used and occupied most of Lake Xochimilco. The United Nations designated it a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System in 2018.

Although different technologies existed during the Post-classic and Colonial periods in the basin, chinampas have raised many questions about agricultural production and political development. After the Aztec Triple Alliance formed, the conquest of southern basin city-states, such as Xochimilco, was one of the first strategies of imperial expansion. Before this time, farmers maintained small-scale chinampas adjacent to their households and communities in the freshwater lakes of Xochimilco and Chalco. The Aztecs did not invent chinampas but rather were the first to develop it to a large scale cultivation. Sometimes referred to as &quot;floating gardens,&quot; chinampas are artificial islands that were created by interweaving reeds with stakes beneath the lake&#x27;s surface, creating underwater fences. A buildup of soil and aquatic vegetation would be piled into these &quot;fences&quot; until the top layer of soil was visible on the water&#x27;s surface.

When creating chinampas, in addition to building up masses of land, a drainage system was developed. This drainage system was multi-purposed. A ditch was created to allow for the flow of water and sediments (likely including night soil). Over time, the ditch would slowly accumulate piles of mud. This mud would then be dug up and placed on top of the chinampas, clearing the blockage. The soil from the bottom of the lake was also rich in nutrients, thus acting as an efficient and effective way of fertilizing the chinampas. Replenishing the topsoil with lost nutrients provided for bountiful harvests. Embarcadero-Jiménez and colleagues tested the correlation between environmental parameters and bacterial diversity in the soil. It is speculated that a diverse array of bacteria can affect the nutrients in the soil. The results found that bacterial diversity was more abundant in cultivated soils than non-cultivated soils. Also, &quot;the structure of the bacterial communities showed that the chinampas are a transition system between sediment and soil and revealed an interesting association of the S-cycle and iron-oxidizing bacteria with the rhizosphere of plants grown in the chinampa soil&quot;.

Evidence from Nahuatl wills from late seventeenth-century Pueblo Culhuacán suggests chinampas were measured in &quot;matl&quot; (one matl = 1.67 meters), often listed in groups of seven. One scholar has calculated the size of chinampas using Codex Vergara as a source, finding that they usually measured roughly . In Tenochtitlan, the chinampas ranged from to They were created by staking out the shallow lake bed and then fencing in the rectangle with wattle. The fenced-off area was then layered with mud, lake sediment, and decaying vegetation, eventually bringing it above the level of the lake. Often trees such as &quot;āhuexōtl&quot; (&quot;Salix bonplandiana&quot;) (a willow) and &quot;āhuēhuētl&quot; (&quot;Taxodium mucronatum&quot;) (a cypress) were planted at the corners to secure the chinampa. In some places, the long raised beds had ditches in between them, giving plants continuous access to water and making crops grown there independent of rainfall. Chinampas were separated by channels wide enough for a canoe to pass. These raised, well-watered beds had very high crop yields with up to 7 harvests a year. Chinampas were commonly used in pre-colonial Mexico and Central America. There is evidence that the Nahua settlement of Culhuacan, on the south side of the Ixtapalapa peninsula that divided Lake Texcoco from Lake Xochimilco, constructed the first chinampas in C.E. 1100.

==History==

The earliest fields that have been securely dated are from the Middle Postclassic period, 1150 – 1350 CE. Chinampas were used primarily in Lakes Xochimilco and Chalco near the springs that lined the south shore of those lakes. The Aztecs not only conducted military campaigns to obtain control over these regions but, according to some researchers, undertook significant state-led efforts to increase their extent. There is some strong evidence to suggest state-led operations for the “expansion” of the chinampas. This is sometimes referred to as the hydraulic hypothesis, which is directly related to a hydraulic empire, which is an empire that maintains power and control through the regulation and distribution of water. There is evidence to support the idea of state involvement, primarily the amount of manpower and materials it would take to build, turn, and maintain the chinampas. However, arguments about state control of the chinampas rely upon the assumption that dikes were necessary to control the water levels and to keep the saline water of Lake Texcoco away from the freshwater of the chinampa zone. This is plausible, but there is evidence that the chinampas were functional before the construction of a dike that protected them from the saline water. It is suggested that the dike was meant to drastically improve the size of the chinampa operation.

Chinampa farms also ringed Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital, which was considerably enlarged over time. Smaller-scale farms have also been identified near the island-city of Xaltocan and on the east side of Lake Texcoco. With the destruction of the dams and sluice gates during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, many chinampas fields were abandoned. However, many lakeshore towns retained their chinampas through the end of the colonial era since cultivation was highly labor-intensive and less attractive for Spaniards to acquire.

The Aztecs built Tenochtitlan on an island around 1325. Issues arose when the cities&#x27; constant expansion eventually caused them to run out of room to build. As the empire grew, more sources of food were required. At times this meant conquering more land; at other times it meant expanding the chinampa system. With this expansion, chinampas&#x27; multiple crops per year became a large factor in the production and supply of food. Empirical records suggest that farmers had a relatively light tribute to pay compared to others because the annual tribute may have been only a fraction of the amount necessary for local needs.

The extent to which Tenochtitlan depended on chinampas for its fresh food supply has been the topic of a number of scholarly studies.

Among the crops grown on chinampas were maize, beans, squash, amaranth, tomatoes, chili peppers, and flowers. Maize was planted with digging stick &quot;huictli&quot; with a wooden blade on one end.

The word &quot;chinampa&quot; comes from the Nahuatl word &quot;chināmitl&quot;, meaning &quot;square made of canes&quot; and the Nahuatl locative, &quot;pan.&quot; In documentation by Spaniards, they used the word &quot;camellones&quot;, &quot;ridges between the rows.&quot; However, Franciscan Fray Juan de Torquemada described them with the Nahua term, chinampa, saying &quot;without much trouble [the Indians] plant and harvest their maize and greens, for all over there are ridges called chinampas; these were strips built above water and surrounded by ditches, which obviates watering.&quot;

Chinampas are depicted in pictorial Aztec codices, including Codex Vergara, Codex Santa María Asunción, the so-called Uppsala Map, and the Maguey Plan (from Azcapotzalco). In alphabetic Nahuatl documentation, &quot;The Testaments of Culhuacan&quot; from the late sixteenth century have numerous references to chinampas as property that individuals bequeathed to their heirs in written wills.

There are still remnants of the chinampa system in Xochimilco, the southern portion of greater Mexico City. Chinampas have been promoted as a model for modern sustainable agriculture, although some sources have disputed the applicability of this model. One anthropologist, for instance, reports that attempts by Mexico to develop chinampas among the Chontal Maya people in the 1970s failed until the technicians modified their goals in order to suit the Chontales&#x27; interests.

Construction:

According to Antonio Vera, through the UH Hilo website, within the framework of chinampas, there was two versions; inland and irrigated chinampas. Inland’s are created on banks, irrigated is built on water. Through steps, the structure of chinampas is to locate shallow land by the bank and surround said area with stakes of a common wetland tree [ahuejote]. The urbanization of Mexico lost this tradition and new challenges are created within the urbanization of Mexico. (https://hilo.hawaii.edu/nihopeku/2018/02/02/chinampa-an-ancient-agricultural-system/)

== Modern chinampas ==

As of 1998, chinampas are still present in San Gregorio, a small town east of Xochimilco, in addition to San Luis, Tlahuac, and Mixquic. Although many of these gardens were constructed and thoroughly tended to from the Postclassic Period through the Spanish conquest, many of these plots of land still exist and are in active use. 

Many of these chinampas have been allowed by present-day farmers to become overgrown. Some choose to use canoes to farm, but many are becoming increasingly dependent on wheelbarrows and bicycles for transportation. Other fields, such as some located in San Gregorio and San Luis areas, have been deliberately filled up. As the canals dry up, several of the fields are naturally joined. Although not used for their original purpose, they are commonly used for cattle feed.

 Other fields, both dried and surrounded by canals, produce foods such as lettuce, cilantro, spinach, chard, squash, parsley, coriander, cauliflower, celery, mint, chives, rosemary, corn, and radishes. The young leaves of quelites and quintoniles, which are often mistaken for weeds, are grown and harvested as ingredients of sauces. Flowers also continue to be grown on these plots. Some chinampa fields are also used as tourist sites.

=== Challenges ===
Although many locals and farmers are happy to return to their agricultural roots, they are faced with several challenges. During the Spanish conquest, many lakes were drained, limiting their agricultural capacity, such as the lake at Xochimilco. In addition, in 1985 an earthquake struck, further damaging several canals. Other challenges include limited water supply, the use of pesticides, climate change, urban sprawl, and water pollution caused by untreated sewage and toxic waste.

<doc id="312266" wikidata="Q183129" url="?curid=312266" title="Water pollution">
<text>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their uses. It is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from one of four main sources. These are sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater. Water pollution may affect either surface water or groundwater. This form of pollution can lead to many problems. One is the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation. Water pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water provided by the water resource.

Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause, such as a storm drain, a wastewater treatment plant, or an oil spill. Non-point sources are more diffuse. An example is agricultural runoff. Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Pollution may take many forms. One would is toxic substances such as oil, metals, plastics, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, and industrial waste products. Another is stressful conditions such as changes of pH, hypoxia or anoxia, increased temperatures, excessive turbidity, or changes of salinity). The introduction of pathogenic organisms is another. Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers.

Control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans as well as legislation. Technology solutions can include improving sanitation, sewage treatment, industrial wastewater treatment, agricultural wastewater treatment, erosion control, sediment control and control of urban runoff (including stormwater management).
== Definition ==
A practical definition of water pollution is: &quot;Water pollution is the addition of substances or energy forms that directly or indirectly alter the nature of the water body in such a manner that negatively affects its legitimate uses.&quot; Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic contaminants. Due to these contaminants, it either no longer supports a certain human use, such as drinking water, or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its biotic communities, such as fish.

== Contaminants ==

===Contaminants with an origin in sewage ===
The following compounds can all reach water bodies via raw sewage or even treated sewage discharges:
* Various chemical compounds found in personal hygiene and cosmetic products.
* Disinfection by-products found in chemically disinfected drinking water (whilst these chemicals can be a pollutant in the water distribution network, they are fairly volatile and therefore not usually found in environmental waters).
* Hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as phthalates that mimic hormones in their action. These can have adverse impacts even at very low concentrations on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is treated and utilized for drinking water.
* Insecticides and herbicides, often from agricultural runoff.
*Pathogens like &quot;Hepatovirus A&quot; (HAV may be present in treated wastewater outflows and receiving water bodies but is largely removed during further treatment of drinking water)

Inadequately treated wastewater can convey nutrients, pathogens, heterogenous suspended solids and organic fecal matter.


==== Pathogens ====
Bacteria, viruses, protozoans and parasitic worms are examples of pathogens that can be found in wastewater. In practice, indicator organisms are used to investigate pathogenic pollution of water because the detection of pathogenic organisms in water sample is difficult and costly, because of their low concentrations. The indicators (bacterial indicator) of fecal contamination of water samples most commonly used are total coliforms (TC) or fecal coliforms (FC), the latter also referred to as thermotolerant coliforms, such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

Pathogens can produce waterborne diseases in either human or animal hosts. Some microorganisms sometimes found in contaminated surface waters that have caused human health problems include &quot;Burkholderia pseudomallei,&quot; &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum,&quot; &quot;Giardia lamblia,&quot; &quot;Salmonella,&quot; norovirus and other viruses, and parasitic worms including the &quot;Schistosoma&quot; type.

The source of high levels of pathogens in water bodies can be from human feces (due to open defecation), sewage, blackwater, or manure that has found its way into the water body. The cause for this can be lack of sanitation procedures or poorly functioning on-site sanitation systems (septic tanks, pit latrines), sewage treatment plants without disinfection steps, sanitary sewer overflows and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during storm events and intensive agriculture (poorly managed livestock operations).

=== Organic compounds ===
Organic substances that enter water bodies are often toxic.
* Petroleum hydrocarbons, including fuels (gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuels, and fuel oil) and lubricants (motor oil), and fuel combustion byproducts, from oil spills or storm water runoff
* Volatile organic compounds, such as improperly stored industrial solvents. Problematic species are organochlorides such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and trichloroethylene, a common solvent.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent organic pollutants.

=== Inorganic contaminants ===
Inorganic water pollutants include:
* Ammonia from food processing waste
* Heavy metals from motor vehicles (via urban storm water runoff) and acid mine drainage
* Nitrates and phosphates, from sewage and agriculture (&quot;see&quot; nutrient pollution)
* Silt (sediment) in runoff from construction sites or sewage, logging, slash and burn practices land clearing sites
* Salt: Freshwater salinization is the process of salty runoff contaminating freshwater ecosystems. Human-induced salinization is termed as secondary salinization, with the use of de-icing road salts as the most common form of runoff.

=== Pharmaceutical pollutants ===

* Environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants, which can include various pharmaceutical drugs and their metabolites (&quot;see also&quot; drug pollution), such as antidepressant drugs, antibiotics or the contraceptive pill.
* Metabolites of illicit drugs (see also wastewater epidemiology), for example methamphetamine and ecstasy.

=== Solid waste and plastics ===

Solid waste can enter water bodies through untreated sewage, combined sewer overflows, urban runoff, people discarding garbage into the environment, wind carrying municipal solid waste from landfills and so forth. This results in macroscopic pollution– large visible items polluting the water– but also microplastics pollution that is not directly visible. The terms marine debris and marine plastic pollution are used in the context of pollution of oceans.

Microplastics persist in the environment at high levels, particularly in aquatic and marine ecosystems, where they cause water pollution. 35% of all ocean microplastics come from textiles/clothing, primarily due to the erosion of polyester, acrylic, or nylon-based clothing, often during the washing process.

Stormwater, untreated sewage and wind are the primary conduits for microplastics from land to sea. Synthetic fabrics, tyres, and city dust are the most common sources of microplastics. These three sources account for more than 80% of all microplastic contamination.

== Types of surface water pollution ==
Surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans. A subset of surface water pollution is marine pollution which affects the oceans. Nutrient pollution refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients.

Globally, about 4.5 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation as of 2017, according to an estimate by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. Lack of access to sanitation is concerning and often leads to water pollution, e.g. via the practice of open defecation: during rain events or floods, the human feces are moved from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. Simple pit latrines may also get flooded during rain events.

As of 2022, Europe and Central Asia account for around 16% of global microplastics discharge into the seas, and although management of plastic waste and its recycling is improving globally, the absolute amount of plastic pollution continues to increase unabated due to the large amount of plastic that is being produced and disposed of. Even if sea plastic pollution were to stop entirely, microplastic contamination of the surface ocean would be projected to continue to increase.

=== Marine pollution ===
=== Nutrient pollution ===
===Thermal pollution===
Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels (due to lower levels of dissolved oxygen, as gases are less soluble in warmer liquids), which can kill fish (which may then rot) and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species.

=== Biological pollution ===
The introduction of aquatic invasive organisms is a form of water pollution as well. It causes biological pollution.

== Groundwater pollution ==
In many areas of the world, groundwater pollution poses a hazard to the wellbeing of people and ecosystems. One-quarter of the world&#x27;s population depends on groundwater for drinking, yet concentrated recharging is known to carry short-lived contaminants into carbonate aquifers and jeopardize the purity of those waters.

== Pollution from point sources ==
Point source water pollution refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single, identifiable source, such as a pipe or ditch. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a sewage treatment plant, a factory, or a city storm drain.

The U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) defines point source for regulatory enforcement purposes (&quot;see&quot; United States regulation of point source water pollution). The CWA definition of point source was amended in 1987 to include municipal storm sewer systems, as well as industrial storm water, such as from construction sites.

=== Sewage ===
Sewage typically consists of 99.9% water and 0.1% solids. Sewage contributes many classes of nutrients that lead to Eutrophication. It is a major source of phosphate for example. Sewage is often contaminated with diverse compounds found in personal hygiene, cosmetics, pharmaceutical drugs (see also drug pollution), and their metabolites Water pollution due to environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants can have wide-ranging consequences. When sewers overflow during storm events this can lead to water pollution from untreated sewage. Such events are called sanitary sewer overflows or combined sewer overflows.

=== Industrial wastewater ===
Industrial processes that use water also produce wastewater. This is called industrial wastewater. Using the US as an example, the main industrial consumers of water (using over 60% of the total consumption) are power plants, petroleum refineries, iron and steel mills, pulp and paper mills, and food processing industries. Some industries discharge chemical wastes, including solvents and heavy metals (which are toxic) and other harmful pollutants.

&lt;section begin=Pollutants in industrial wastewater/&gt;Industrial wastewater could add the following pollutants to receiving water bodies if the wastewater is not treated and managed properly:
* Heavy metals, including mercury, lead, and chromium
* Organic matter and nutrients such as food waste: Certain industries (e.g. food processing, slaughterhouse waste, paper fibers, plant material, etc.) discharge high concentrations of BOD, ammonia nitrogen and oil and grease.
* Inorganic particles such as sand, grit, metal particles, rubber residues from tires, ceramics, etc.;
* Toxins such as pesticides, poisons, herbicides, etc.
* Pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, hormones, perfluorinated compounds, siloxanes, drugs of abuse and other hazardous substances
* Microplastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene beads, polyester and polyamide
* Thermal pollution from power stations and industrial manufacturers
* Radionuclides from uranium mining, processing nuclear fuel, operating nuclear reactors, or disposal of radioactive waste.
* Some industrial discharges include persistent organic pollutants such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).&lt;section end=Pollutants in industrial wastewater/&gt;

=== Oil spills ===
== Pollution from nonpoint sources ==
=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture is a major contributor to water pollution from nonpoint sources. The use of fertilizers as well as surface runoff from farm fields, pastures and feedlots leads to nutrient pollution. In addition to plant-focused agriculture, fish-farming is also a source of pollution. Additionally, agricultural runoff often contains high levels of pesticides.

=== Atmospheric contributions (air pollution) ===
Air deposition is a process whereby air pollutants from industrial or natural sources settle into water bodies. The deposition may lead to polluted water near the source, or at distances up to a few thousand miles away. The most frequently observed water pollutants resulting from industrial air deposition are sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, mercury compounds, other heavy metals, and some pesticides and industrial by-products. Natural sources of air deposition include forest fires and microbial activity.

Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere. The main source of sulfur and nitrogen compounds that result in acid rain are anthropogenic, but nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes and sulphur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic ecosystems and infrastructure.

Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased since the 1850s due anthropogenic influences (emissions of greenhouse gases). This leads to ocean acidification and is another form of water pollution from atmospheric contributions.

== Sampling, measurements, analysis ==

Water pollution may be analyzed through several broad categories of methods: physical, chemical and biological. Some methods may be conducted &quot;in situ&quot;, without sampling, such as temperature. Others involve collection of samples, followed by specialized analytical tests in the laboratory. Standardized, validated analytical test methods, for water and wastewater samples have been published.

Common physical tests of water include temperature, Specific conductance or electrical conductance (EC) or conductivity, solids concentrations (e.g., total suspended solids (TSS)) and turbidity. Water samples may be examined using analytical chemistry methods. Many published test methods are available for both organic and inorganic compounds. Frequently used parameters that are quantified are pH, BOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), total hardness, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, e.g. nitrate and orthophosphates), metals (including copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury), oil and grease, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), surfactants and pesticides.

The use of a biomonitor or bioindicator is described as biological monitoring. This refers to the measurement of specific properties of an organism to obtain information on the surrounding physical and chemical environment. Biological testing involves the use of plant, animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an aquatic ecosystem. They are any biological species or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental integrity is present. One example of a group of bio-indicators are the copepods and other small water crustaceans that are present in many water bodies. Such organisms can be monitored for changes (biochemical, physiological, or behavioral) that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem.

== Impacts ==
=== Ecosystems ===
Water pollution is a major global environmental problem because it can result in the degradation of all aquatic ecosystems – fresh, coastal, and ocean waters. The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of chemicals, pathogens, and physical changes such as elevated temperature. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring (calcium, sodium, iron, manganese, etc.) the concentration usually determines what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. High concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on aquatic flora and fauna. Oxygen-depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter (e.g. leaves and grass) as well as human-made chemicals. Other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause turbidity (cloudiness) which blocks light and disrupts plant growth, and clogs the gills of some fish species.

=== Public health and waterborne diseases ===

A study published in 2017 stated that &quot;polluted water spread gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic infections and killed 1.8 million people&quot; (these are also referred to as waterborne diseases). Persistent exposure to pollutants through water are environmental health hazards, which can increase the likelihood for one to develop cancer or other diseases.

=== Eutrophication from nitrogen pollution ===
Nitrogen pollution can cause eutrophication, especially in lakes. Eutrophication is an increase in the concentration of chemical nutrients in an ecosystem to an extent that increases the primary productivity of the ecosystem. Subsequent negative environmental effects such as anoxia (oxygen depletion) and severe reductions in water quality may occur. This can harm fish and other animal populations.

=== Ocean acidification ===
Ocean acidification is another impact of water pollution. Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH value of the Earth&#x27;s oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide () from the atmosphere.

== Prevalence ==
Water pollution is a problem in developing countries as well as in developed countries.

=== By country ===
For example, water pollution in India and China is widespread. About 90 percent of the water in the cities of China is polluted.

==Control and reduction==
=== Pollution control philosophy ===
One aspect of environmental protection is mandatory regulations, which are only part of the solution. Other important tools in pollution control include environmental education, economic instruments, market forces, and stricter enforcement. Standards can be &quot;precise&quot; (for a defined quantifiable minimum or maximum value for a pollutant), or &quot;imprecise&quot; which would require the use of Best available technology (BAT) or Best practicable environmental option (BPEO). Market-based economic instruments for pollution control can include charges, subsidies, deposit or refund schemes, the creation of a market in pollution credits, and enforcement incentives.

Moving towards a holistic approach in chemical pollution control combines the following approaches: Integrated control measures, trans-boundary considerations, complementary and supplementary control measures, life-cycle considerations, the impacts of chemical mixtures.

Control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans. The infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants, for example sewage treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants. Agricultural wastewater treatment for farms, and erosion control at construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow.

Water pollution requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells).

=== Sanitation and sewage treatment ===
Municipal wastewater can be treated by centralized sewage treatment plants, decentralized wastewater systems, nature-based solutions or in onsite sewage facilities and septic tanks. For example, waste stabilization ponds can be a low cost treatment option for sewage. UV light (sunlight) can be used to degrade some pollutants in waste stabilization ponds (sewage lagoons). The use of safely managed sanitation services would prevent water pollution caused by lack of access to sanitation.

Well-designed and operated systems (i.e., with secondary treatment stages or more advanced tertiary treatment) can remove 90 percent or more of the pollutant load in sewage. Some plants have additional systems to remove nutrients and pathogens. While such advanced treatment techniques will undoubtedly reduce the discharges of micropollutants, they can also result in large financial costs, as well as environmentally undesirable increases in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Sewer overflows during storm events can be addressed by timely maintenance and upgrades of the sewerage system. In the US, cities with large combined systems have not pursued system-wide separation projects due to the high cost, but have implemented partial separation projects and green infrastructure approaches. In some cases municipalities have installed additional CSO storage facilities or expanded sewage treatment capacity.

===Industrial wastewater treatment===
===Agricultural wastewater treatment===
===Management of erosion and sediment control===

Sediment from construction sites can be managed by installation of erosion controls, such as mulching and hydroseeding, and sediment controls, such as sediment basins and silt fences. Discharge of toxic chemicals such as motor fuels and concrete washout can be prevented by use of spill prevention and control plans, and specially designed containers (e.g. for concrete washout) and structures such as overflow controls and diversion berms.

Erosion caused by deforestation and changes in hydrology (soil loss due to water runoff) also results in loss of sediment and, potentially, water pollution.

=== Control of urban runoff (storm water) ===

=== Legislation ===
==== Philippines ====
In the Philippines, Republic Act 9275, otherwise known as the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004, is the governing law on wastewater management. It states that it is the country&#x27;s policy to protect, preserve and revive the quality of its fresh, brackish and marine waters, for which wastewater management plays a particular role.

==== United Kingdom ====
In 2024, The Royal Academy of Engineering released a study into the effects wastewater on public health in the United Kingdom. The study gained media attention, with comments from the UKs leading health professionals, including Sir Chris Whitty. Outlining 15 recommendations for various UK bodies to dramatically reduce public health risks by increasing the water quality in its waterways, such as rivers and lakes.

After the release of the report, The Guardian newspaper interviewed Whitty, who stated that improving water quality and sewage treatment should be a high level of importance and a &quot;public health priority&quot;. He compared it to eradicating cholera in the 19th century in the country following improvements to the sewage treatment network. The study also identified that low water flows in rivers saw high concentration levels of sewage, as well as times of flooding or heavy rainfall. While heavy rainfall had always been associated with sewage overflows into streams and rivers, the British media went as far to warn parents of the dangers of paddling in shallow rivers during warm weather.

Whitty&#x27;s comments came after the study revealed that the UK was experiencing a growth in the number of people that were using coastal and inland waters recreationally. This could be connected to a growing interest in activities such as open water swimming or other water sports. Despite this growth in recreation, poor water quality meant some were becoming unwell during events. Most notably, the 2024 Paris Olympics had to delay numerous swimming-focused events like the triathlon due to high levels of sewage in the River Seine.

<text>Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) was a contract research organisation (CRO) organized in Maryland and headquartered in East Millstone, New Jersey. It was founded in 1951 in Cambridgeshire, England. It had two laboratories in the United Kingdom and one in the United States. With over 1,600 employees, it was the largest non-clinical CRO in Europe and the third-largest non-clinical CRO in the world. In September 2015, Huntingdon Life Sciences, Harlan Laboratories, GFA, NDA Analytics and LSR associates merged into Envigo (now Inotiv).

HLS provided contract research organization services in pre-clinical and non-clinical biological safety evaluation research. As with other major CROs operating in this business area, its major business is serving the pharmaceutical industry. However, more than a third of its business came from non-pharmaceutical sources, such as the crop protection industry which accounts for around 60% of its non-pharmaceutical business.

HLS had two facilities in the UK (Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire and Eye, Suffolk), one in the USA (East Millstone, New Jersey) and an office in Japan (Tokyo).

The company was one of the largest participants in the international primate trade and has been criticized for its animal testing practices, most specifically animal testing on non-human primates as well as on beagles. The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign was formed with the goal of shutting down the company due to animal rights violations.

==History==
Huntingdon Life Sciences was founded in the UK in 1951 as Nutrition Research Co. Ltd., a commercial organisation that initially focused on nutrition, veterinary, and biochemical research. The original facilities were split over two locations; the main offices were within Cromwell House in the town of Huntingdon; and the main laboratories were at the Hartford Field Station, just over a mile away. It then became involved with pharmaceuticals, food additives, and industrial and consumer chemicals. In 1959 it changed its name to Nutritional Research Unit Ltd. The company benefited in the early 1960s from increased government regulatory testing requirements, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. In 1964, it was acquired by Becton Dickinson.

In April 1983, Becton Dickinson created Huntingdon Research Centre PLC. It then offered four million American depositary receipts (ADRs) for sale at $15 each, representing the company&#x27;s entire interest in Huntingdon. In 1985, as it began to expand its operations, the company changed its name to Huntingdon International Holdings plc. That year, it established Huntingdon Analytical Services Inc. to conduct business in the United States.

To augment its CRO business, Huntingdon acquired Minnesota&#x27;s Twin City Testing Laboratory and affiliated companies in 1985, followed by the acquisition of Nebraska Testing Corporation in 1986; Travis Laboratories and Kansas City Test Laboratory Inc. in 1989; and Southwestern Laboratories, Inc. in 1990. Huntingdon also diversified its operations, primarily in the United States, becoming involved in engineering and environmental services.

In 1987, HLS acquired Northern Engineering and Testing. In 1988, it acquired Empire Soils Investigations, Chen Associates, and Asteco Inc. In 1988, HLS was floated on the London Stock Exchange and in 1989 obtained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1990, Huntingdon acquired the St. Louis branch of Envirodyne Engineers and Whiteley Holdings. In 1991, it acquired Austin Research Engineers, followed by Travers Morgan.

By the early 1990s, Huntingdon was organised into three business groups: the Life Sciences Group, the Engineering/Environmental Group, and the Travers Morgan Group, which offered engineering and environmental consulting services outside of the United States. However, only the Life Sciences Group showed long-term promise. Travers Morgan was allowed to lapse into insolvency, control passed into other hands, and Huntingdon wrote off the investment. In 1995, the engineering and environmental businesses were sold to Maxim Engineers of Dallas, Texas.

To bolster its CRO business and reinforce its U.S. presence, in 1995, Huntingdon acquired the toxicology business of Applied Biosciences International for $32.5 million in cash, plus the Leicester Clinical Research Centre. The deal included a U.S. laboratory located near Princeton, New Jersey, as well as two British facilities. In 1997, Huntingdon International Holdings changed its name to Huntingdon Life Sciences Group. The U.K. subsidiary, Huntingdon Research Centre, changed its name to Huntingdon Life Sciences, while the U.S. business operated as Huntingdon Life Sciences Inc.

In 2002, HLS moved its financial centre to the United States and incorporated in Maryland as Life Sciences Research.

In 2009, HLS was acquired.

In September 2015, Huntingdon Life Sciences, Harlan Laboratories, GFA, NDA Analytics and LSR associates merged into Envigo (now Inotiv).

==Staff numbers==
The latest available public figures from 2008 show that HLS employs more than 1,600 staff across all of its facilities. They break down as:
==Trade bodies and associations==
* Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) 
* Bioindustry Association (BIA) 
* Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) 
* Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC)
* Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments (FRAME) 
* Institute of Animal Technology (IAT)
* Understanding Animal Research (UAR) 

==Honours and awards==
*Agrow Awards Best Supporting Role 2007
*Queens Award for Export Achievement 1982.

==Use of animals==
HLS uses animals in the biomedical research it conducts for its customers. The most recent numbers released state that in the UK around 60,000 animals are used annually. This number is broken down by species:

==Controversies==
Huntingdon is criticised by animal rights and animal welfare groups for using animals in research, for instances of animal abuse and for the wide range of substances it tests on animals, particularly non-medical products. It is claimed by SHAC that 500 animals died every day at HLS (182,500 a year), a figure at odds with HLS&#x27; published numbers.

Huntingdon&#x27;s labs were infiltrated by undercover animal rights activists in 1997 in the UK and in 1998 in the US.

In 1997, film secretly recorded inside HLS in the UK by BUAV and subsequently broadcast on Channel 4 television as &quot;It&#x27;s a Dog&#x27;s Life&quot;, showed serious breaches of animal-protection laws, including a beagle puppy being held up by the scruff of the neck and repeatedly punched in the face, and animals being taunted.

The laboratory technicians responsible were suspended from HLS the day after the broadcast. All three were later dismissed. Two of the men seen hitting and shaking dogs were found guilty under the Protection of Animals Act 1911 of &quot;cruelly terrifying dogs.&quot; It was the first time laboratory technicians had been prosecuted for animal cruelty in the UK. HLS admitted that the technicians&#x27; behaviour was deplorable and a new management team was introduced the following year which, according to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;introduced greater openness and new training methods.&quot;

In 1998, an undercover investigator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) used a camera hidden in her glasses to make 50 hours of videotape of the HLS laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. She also made four 90-minute audiotapes, photocopied 8,000 company documents, and copied the company&#x27;s client list. According to PETA some of the film she shot showed a monkey being dissected while still alive and conscious. The president of HLS in New Jersey, Alan Staple, said the monkey was alive but sedated during the dissection.

A 2001 article from The Resurgence Trust stated that HLS obtained a &quot;gagging order&quot; in the US that prevents PETA from publicising or talking about any of the information that they discovered. The order also prevented PETA from communicating with the American Department of Agriculture, which had been going to investigate the evidence.

===Protests and intimidation===
The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) campaign is based in the UK and US, and has aimed to close the company down since 1999. According to its website, the campaign&#x27;s methods are restricted to non-violent direct action, as well as lobbying and demonstrations. It targets not only HLS itself, but any company, institution, or person allegedly doing business with the laboratory, whether as clients, suppliers, or even disposal and cleaning services, and the employees of those companies.

Despite its stated non-violent position, SHAC members have been convicted of crimes of violence against HLS employees. On 25 October 2010 five SHAC members received prison sentences for threatening HLS staff. SHAC has also been accused of encouraging arson and violent assault. An HLS director was assaulted in front of his child. HLS managing director Brian Cass was sent a mousetrap primed with razor blades, and in February 2001 was attacked by three men armed with pickaxe handles and CS gas. Another businessman with links to HLS was attacked and knocked unconscious adjacent to a barn his assailants had set alight.

Both SHAC and Animal Liberation Front activists have been alleged to have been engaged in harassment and intimidation, including issuing hoax bomb threats and death threats. In 2003, Daniel Andreas San Diego was accused by the American FBI of &quot;ecoterrorism&quot; in support of SHAC in the San Francisco Area; however, there is some question whether his &quot;terrorist plot&quot; was an entrapment operation by the American FBI. In 2008 seven of SHAC&#x27;s senior members were described by prosecutors as &quot;some of the key figures in the Animal Liberation Front&quot; and found guilty of conspiracy to blackmail HLS.

===Effect of campaign===
The campaign against HLS led to its share price crashing, the Royal Bank of Scotland closing its bank account, and the British government arranging for the Bank of England to give them an account. In 2000, HLS was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange because of its market capitalization had fallen below NYSE limits.

===Government response===

From 2006, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reports, the British Government took the decision to tackle &quot;the problem of animal rights extremism.&quot; On 1 May 2007, a police campaign called &quot;Operation Achilles&quot; was enacted against SHAC, a series of raids involving 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium. In total, 32 people linked to the group were arrested, and seven leading members of SHAC, including Greg Avery, were found guilty of blackmail. Police estimated in 2007 that, as a consequence of the operation, &quot;up to three quarters of the most violent activists&quot; were jailed. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; writes that the number of attacks on HLS and their business declined drastically but &quot;the movement is by no means dead.&quot;

<doc id="312271" wikidata="Q927425" url="?curid=312271" title="French overture">
<text>The French overture is a musical form widely used in the Baroque period. Its basic formal division is into two parts, which are usually enclosed by double bars and repeat signs. They are complementary in style (slow in dotted rhythms and fast in fugal style), and the first ends with a half-cadence (i.e., on a dominant harmony) that requires an answering structure with a tonic ending. The second section often but not always ends with a brief recollection of the first, sometimes even repeating some of its melodic content.

The form is first encountered in Jean-Baptiste Lully&#x27;s ballet overtures from the 1650s. Later examples can be found as the opening movement of each of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s orchestral suites, Partita in D major, BWV 828, C minor Cello Suite, BWV 1011, and as an opening to many operas and oratorios by George Frideric Handel (including &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;). The 16th of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; is a miniature French overture.

The French overture should not be confused with the Italian overture, a three-part quick-slow-quick structure.

<doc id="312278" wikidata="Q3820836" url="?curid=312278" title="Fairy with Turquoise Hair">
<text>The Fairy with Turquoise Hair (), often simply referred to as the Blue Fairy (), is a fictional character in the 1883 Italian book &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; by Carlo Collodi, repeatedly appearing at critical moments in Pinocchio&#x27;s wanderings to admonish the little wooden puppet to avoid bad or risky behavior.

Although the naïvely willful marionette initially resists her good advice, he later comes to follow her instruction. She in turn protects him, and later enables his assumption of human form, contrary to the prior wooden form.

== In the novel ==

The Fairy with Turquoise Hair makes her first appearance in chapter XV, where she is portrayed as a young girl living in a house in the middle of a forest. Pinocchio, who is being chased by The Fox and the Cat (&quot;Il Gatto e la Volpe&quot;), pleads with the Fairy to allow him entrance. The Fairy cryptically responds that all inhabitants of the house, including herself, are dead, and that she is waiting for her coffin to arrive. The pair catches and hangs Pinocchio from a tree. In the following chapter, it is established that the girl is a fairy who has lived in the forest for more than a thousand years. She takes pity on Pinocchio, and sends a falcon to take him down from the tree and for her poodle servant Medoro to prep her stagecoach. 

After a visit from three doctors consisting of an Owl, a Crow, and the Talking Cricket (&quot;Il Grillo Parlante&quot;), the Fairy attempts to give Pinocchio medicine in order to heal his injuries. Pinocchio refuses to take the medicine on account of its sour taste, then a group of coffin-bearing undertaker rabbits arrive to take him. Frightened by this display, Pinocchio drinks the medicine, and later tells the Fairy of his previous adventures. When he includes untruths, his nose begins to lengthen, which the Fairy explains is due to his lies. She summons a group of woodpeckers to shorten the disproportionate nose, and after forgiving Pinocchio, informs him that he is free to consider her an elder sister, and that his father Mister Geppetto is on his way to fetch him. In his impatience, Pinocchio leaves the house anyway, but instead of finding him he goes to the field of miracles with the fox and the cat.
After spending some time in the Catchfools prison, Pinocchio returns to the Fairy&#x27;s house only to find a tombstone declaring that the Fairy died believing that Pinocchio had abandoned her. In the following chapter, Pinocchio is transported to the Island of Busy Bees (&quot;Isola delle Api Industriose&quot;), where he meets the Fairy, now older, disguised as an ordinary woman. Unaware of the deception, Pinocchio offers to carry buckets of water to her house in exchange for a meal. After eating, Pinocchio recognizes the Fairy&#x27;s turquoise hair.

The Fairy agrees to adopt him as her son, and promises to turn him into a real boy, provided he earns it through hard study and obedience for one year. Later, she reveals to Pinocchio that his days of puppethood are almost over, and that she will organize a celebration in his honour; but Pinocchio is convinced by his friend, Candlewick (&quot;Lucignolo&quot;) to go for Land of Toys (&quot;Paese dei Balocchi&quot;) a place who the boys don&#x27;t have anything besides play. In the midnight they are taken on a wagon by The Coachman.

Five months later, Pinocchio is transformed into a donkey and be sold to a circus ringleader to jump, dance and bow. In the middle of the show he sees the fairy in the audience, she wore a long gold chain, from which hung a large medallion with an image of a puppet. Pinocchio became lame and was sold to a musician to make a drum and later thrown into the sea by his handler.

Where upon the Fairy sends a shoal of fish to consume his donkey&#x27;s appearance until he is returned to his puppet form. Taking the form of a blue-furred mountain goat, the Fairy warns Pinocchio of the impending arrival of The Terrible Dogfish, but is unsuccessful. It is revealed in chapter XXXVI that she gives a house to the Talking Cricket (who offers to accommodate both Pinocchio and the sickly Geppetto) while she was in the form of the blue-furred mountain goat. The Fairy becomes ill too, so Pinocchio gives some of the money he&#x27;s earned to her snail to give to her.

She finally appears to Pinocchio in a dream, gives the boy a kiss, and commends him for having taken care of his ailing father and herself. Upon awakening, Pinocchio has become human, and all his copper coins have turned to gold, accompanied by a note from the Fairy professing her responsibility.

==In adaptations==
===Disney===
In Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, the Fairy (voiced by Evelyn Venable) is referred to as The Blue Fairy, and is one of the four leading protagonists in the film. It is she who brings Pinocchio to life and appoints Jiminy Cricket as Pinocchio&#x27;s conscience. She is depicted with blonde hair and blue eyes, rather than the turquoise hair and black eyes of her book counterpart. In this case, the &quot;blue&quot; in her name refers to her eyes and her gown.

The Blue Fairy also makes an appearance (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) in the TV musical &quot;Geppetto&quot;. Voiced by Rosalyn Landor, the fairy appears in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; as a guest at the titular night club. In the film &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;, voiced again by Landor, she helps Spot Helperman realize his dreams to pose as a boy.

She appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot; voiced by Miyuki Ichijo in the Japanese version and reprised by Landor in the English dub. Just like the film, the Blue Fairy explains to Pinocchio about the side effects of his lies to Jiminy Cricket. She later tells Sora (voiced by Miyu Irino and Haley Joel Osment) that Geppetto was swallowed by Monstro and that Pinocchio and Jiminy went to go rescue him.

The Blue Fairy (voiced by Grey DeLisle) also makes a cameo in the &quot;Disappearing Act&quot; episode of &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;.

The Blue Fairy is portrayed by Cynthia Erivo in the 2022 live-action/CGI remake of the animated film, making her the first black actress to play the role. Unlike the original film, the Blue Fairy appears only once where she brings him to life.

The Blue Fairy is the main character in the prequel novel &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; written by Elizabeth Lim and published on April 4, 2023 as part of Disney&#x27;s &quot;A Twisted Tale&quot; anthology series. The story details her origins as Chiara Belmagio, a baker&#x27;s eldest daughter and philanthropist in the small Italian town of Pariva, her complex relationship with her narcissistic younger sister Ilaria and her eventual transformation into a fairy.

===Other appearances===
In Giuliano Cenci&#x27;s 1972 animated film &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, the Fairy (voiced by Vittoria Febbi with Martha Scott doing her English-voice dub) is portrayed much more accurately to the book than she is in the Disney adaptation. She has no role in creating Pinocchio, though she does offer him guidance and support. Though she is accurately portrayed as sporting blue hair, she does not physically age as she does in the book. 

In 1972&#x27;s Italian miniseries &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, she is played by Gina Lollobrigida. Her role is similar to the book, with the difference that she is really the ghost of Geppetto&#x27;s deceased wife.

The Fairy appears in the 1972 TV series &quot;&quot; is referred to as Oak Fairy and is resident of oak tree from which Pinocchio was created. She acts as Pinocchio&#x27;s guidance and offers advice to help Pinocchio when he is in a difficult situation. In last episode Oak Fairy, proud of dead Pinocchio&#x27;s courage and kindness, brings him back to life as a real boy. After this, the fairy leaves him, saying that from now on he must take care of himself. Pinocchio calls her his godmother.

In 1976&#x27;s West German-Austrian-Japanese animated series &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, the role of Fairy is the same like in the book although she does not physically age and stays as a young woman. She acts as a motherly figure and teacher to Pinocchio and gets to rescue him from harm several times. After Pinocchio finds her tombstone instead of her house she appears later in different forms including a giant pigeon. Eventually, as a reward to Pinocchio&#x27;s good deeds, the fairy decides to transform him into a real boy.

In the 1987 film &quot;Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night&quot;, the Good Fairy (voiced by Rickie Lee Jones) appears as Pinocchio&#x27;s guide. In the beginning she arrives at his birthday party and brings to life his glowworm, which he names Gee Willikers. Later, she brings him back to life after he has been turned back into a puppet by Puppetino and tells him to make the right choices. After the defeat of the Emperor, she restores Pinocchio, brings back Geppetto&#x27;s jewel box which had been stolen earlier, and brings Twinkle, a girl who had been turned into a puppet, back to life.

In the 1992 direct-to-video adaptation by GoodTimes Entertainment, the Blue Fairy (voiced by Jeannie Elias) is portrayed more like her Disney counterpart with blonde hair instead of turquoise. She is soft-spoken and sweet. The Blue Fairy is also a motherly figure to Pinocchio and guides him. She also has a broken heart when she realizes that Pinocchio is swallowed by a whale, but Pinocchio becomes good and repays her kindness by doing the good things.

In the 1996 film &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, the character of Leona (played by Geneviève Bujold) serves as the Blue Fairy&#x27;s stand-in in the film. She is a beloved and long-time friend of Geppetto with whom he is secretly in love - a love which is actually mutual, despite her having previously married his late brother (similar to the 1972&#x27;s Italian miniseries of a similar name).

In &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot;, the Fairy is actually called the &quot;Blues Fairy&quot; (voiced by Della Reese) and is like her Disney counterpart who tells Pinocchio, aka Pinoak, what is right and what is wrong.

In Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2001 movie &quot;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001), the Blue Fairy (voiced by Meryl Streep) appears as a plot MacGuffin. The main character David (played by Haley Joel Osment, who also voices Sora in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; example above), a robotic child believes that the Blue Fairy has the power to turn him into a real boy. It also appears in the form of the Coney Island statue of the Blue Fairy which David mistakes for a real blue fairy.

In &quot;Buratino&quot;, the Russian adaptation of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, there is a female character with blue hair named Malvina.

In Roberto Benigni&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, the Blue Fairy is portrayed by Italian actress Nicoletta Braschi with her English-dubbed voice provided by Glenn Close.

In &quot;Pinocchio and Friends&quot;, the Blue Fairy is the teacher Pinocchio and Freeda. He lives in the Magical Forest with his dog and his housekeeper. She has a very giggly, bubbly and sensitive personality.

Angelica the Blue Fairy is the antagonist in the Japanese/Australian stage show &quot;Once Upon a Midnight.&quot;

&quot;The Blue Fairy&quot; was a 1950s&#x27; children&#x27;s program on WGN-TV in Chicago, hosted by Brigid Bazlen as the fairy.

In a 1997 article for the &quot;Miami New Times&quot;, reporter Lynda Edwards describes hearing modern urban legends from Miami&#x27;s homeless children, who cope with their situation by invoking Latino and Afro-Cuban legends including the image of &quot;the pale blue lady&quot; or blue fairy. Derived from the Catholic legend of the Blessed Mother leading a spiritual army of angels, the Blue Lady protects the children from poverty-related terrors, against the minions of a vengeful La Llorona.

In Alberto Sironi&#x27;s 2008 miniseries, the Blue Fairy is portrayed by Violante Placido. She rescues Pinocchio from being murdered by the Fox and the Cat in a dark forest and nurses him back to health. She warns him that he must be good and to not run astray in the future, otherwise both her heart and Gepetto&#x27;s will break in disappointment. She also states that because their hearts are not made of wood there would be no magic capable of mending them if it happened.

In the 2012 Italian animated film &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, the Fairy seems as young as Pinocchio and shows a sense of humour. As on many versions, she forgives him and encourages him to do good. She restores him from his donkey form to puppet form, and also turns him to a real boy for risking his life for Gepetto. 

In the Vertigo comic series &quot;Fables&quot;, she appears as a blue-haired fairy who makes Pinocchio into a (never-aging) boy.

Actress Keegan Connor Tracy plays the Blue Fairy in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. In the series, the residents of Storybrooke, Maine are former fairytale characters with their memories wiped by a curse cast by the Evil Queen from the tale of &quot;Snow White&quot;. The good fairies from the fairytale world are transformed into the nuns of Storybrooke&#x27;s local convent, with the Blue Fairy as Mother Superior. Her history with Pinocchio is still intact, but is also shown to have histories with Tinker Bell, Tiger Lily, and Fiona the Black Fairy.

In the live-action Italian film &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (2019), co-written, directed and co-produced by Matteo Garrone, the Fairy is portrayed by as a child and Marine Vacth (dubbed by Domitilla D&#x27;Amico) as an adult. In the English version, Baldari Calabria dubbed herself, while Vacth was dubbed again by D&#x27;Amico.

In the 2022 stop-motion Netflix film &quot;Pinocchio&quot; produced, written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, The Fairy with Turquoise Hair is rewritten as the character of the &quot;Wood Sprite&quot; (voiced by Tilda Swinton) whose appearance is a blue hairless humanoid with eight wings that have eyes on them and a feathered snake-like tail. The Wood Sprite also has a sister named Death (also voiced by Tilda Swinton).

In the 2023 Soulslike Lies of P the Blue Fairy appears as a character named Sophia who, like the fire keeper from Dark Souls 3, appears in the central hub of the game to help players level up and provides crucial information about the game world and plot.

<text>The Austin Lounge Lizards are a musical group from Austin, Texas, formed in 1980. The band includes founding members Hank Card and Conrad Deisler, along with Tim Wilson and Kirk Williams. The third founding member, Tom Pittman, retired from the band in the spring of 2011.

The band started out experimenting with folk, but was still heavily country in its style, combining the bluegrass form with which Pittman was familiar with the progressive-themed folk rock to which Card and Deisler had been accustomed. Between the members, a large number of different instruments have been played, including a rich variety of string instruments such as the banjo, mandolin, and fiddle.

The band got its name because, Deisler explained, &quot;I think it was a slang term I&#x27;d heard my grandmother use to describe gentlemen of easy virtue who hung around in bars. When we started out, that&#x27;s just what we were doing—hanging out and playing for beer and tips and stuff like that.&quot; The Austin Lounge Lizards began by playing covers, but eventually they wanted to move towards trying to write their own songs.

== Songwriting and sound ==
All the group&#x27;s members contribute to songwriting, but the two principal songwriters have been Card and Deisler. Card&#x27;s lyrics often rely on clever word plays, double entendres, and off-beat but sometimes poignant narratives about ordinary life. His most frequent subject matter is love, especially comically forlorn yearning (Example: &quot;The Dogs, They Really Miss You&quot;). Deisler&#x27;s lyrics, in contrast, focus on the existentially absurd, often combining absurdly unexpected pairings (such as making Richard Petty the subject of a surreal Luis Buñuel film) as well as pitiable, sometimes lovable characters bewilderingly unaware of their own absurdity and oddness (Examples: &quot;Wendell the Uncola Man&quot; or &quot;Old Blevins&quot;). A recurring theme is the inanity of country music clichés, for example the &quot;we were happier when we were poor&quot; trope exaggerated into absurdity in &quot;Love in a Refrigerator Box&quot;. Deisler&#x27;s lyrics also marry comedy with a remarkably dark vision of humanity and its future (Example: Bonfire of the Inanities).

The sound became less country and progressed more to politically aware songs. The songs they wrote tended to be humorous in an extremely off-beat way, in addition to their political nature, in a way reminiscent of Country Joe McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Fixing to Die Rag&quot;. These songs tend to have primarily liberal messages, &quot;The Ballad of Ronald Reagan&quot;, criticizes the Republican American president, while &quot;Gingrich the Newt&quot; criticizes the then-Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich. Their song, &quot;Saguaro&quot;, co-written by Ann Clardy and Michael Stevens (former bass player), is based on the story of David Grundman, who died from shooting a cactus (see cactus plugging).

<doc id="312280" wikidata="Q495751" url="?curid=312280" title="Mi'kmaq">
<text>The Mi&#x27;kmaq (also Mi&#x27;gmaq, Lnu, Mi&#x27;kmaw or &quot;Mi&#x27;gmaw&quot;; ; , and formerly Micmac) are an Indigenous group of people of the Northeastern Woodlands, native to the areas of Canada&#x27;s Atlantic Provinces, primarily Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland, and the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec as well as Native Americans in the northeastern region of Maine. The traditional national territory of the Mi&#x27;kmaq is named Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki (or Mi&#x27;gma&#x27;gi).

There are 66,748 Mi&#x27;kmaq people in the region as of 2023 (including 25,182 members in the more recently formed Qalipu First Nation in Newfoundland). According to the Canadian 2021 census, 9,245 people claim to speak Mi&#x27;kmaq, an Eastern Algonquian language. Once written in Mi&#x27;kmaw hieroglyphic writing, it is now written using most letters of the Latin alphabet.

The Mi&#x27;kmaq, Maliseet, and Pasamaquoddy nations signed a series of treaties known as the Covenant Chain of Peace and Friendship Treaties with the British Crown throughout the eighteenth century; the first was signed in 1725, and the last in 1779. The Mi&#x27;kmaq maintain that they did not cede or give up their land title or other rights through these Peace and Friendship Treaties. The landmark 1999 Supreme Court of Canada decision in &quot;R v Marshall&quot; upheld the 1752 Peace and Friendship Treaty &quot;which promised Indigenous Peoples the right to hunt and fish their lands and establish trade.&quot;

The Mi&#x27;kmaw Grand Council is the official authority that engages in consultation with the Canadian federal government and the provincial government of Nova Scotia, as established by the historic August 30, 2010, agreement with the Mi&#x27;kmaq Nation, resulting from the Mi&#x27;kmaq–Nova Scotia–Canada Tripartite Forum. This collaborative agreement, which includes all the First Nations within the province of Nova Scotia, was the first in Canadian history.

Historically, the &quot;Santé Mawiómi&quot;, or Grand Council, which was made up of chiefs of the district councils of &quot;Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki&quot;, was the traditional senior level of government for the Mi&#x27;kmaw people. The 1876 &quot;Indian Act&quot; disrupted that authority, by requiring First Nations to establish representative elected governments along the Canadian model, and attempting to limit the Council&#x27;s role to spiritual guidance.

==Grand Council &quot;Santé Mawiómi&quot;==
On August 30, 2010, the Mi&#x27;kmaw Nation and the Nova Scotia provincial government reached an historic agreement, affirming that the Mi&#x27;kmaw Grand Council was the official consultative authority that engages with the Canadian federal government and the provincial government of Nova Scotia. The Mi&#x27;kmaq–Nova Scotia–Canada Tripartite Forum preceded the agreement. The August 2010 agreement is the first such collaborative agreement in Canadian history; it includes representation for all the First Nations within the entire province of Nova Scotia.

Historically the &quot;Santé Mawiómi&quot;, or Grand Council, which was made up of chiefs of the district councils of &quot;Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki&quot;, was the traditional senior level of government for the Mi&#x27;kmaw people. The 1876 &quot;Indian Act&quot; disrupted that authority, by requiring First Nations to establish representative elected governments and attempting to limit the Council&#x27;s role to that of spiritual guidance.

In addition to the district councils, the M&#x27;ikmaq have been traditionally governed by a Grand Council or &quot;Santé Mawiómi&quot;. The Grand Council was composed of &quot;Keptinaq&quot; (&quot;captains&quot; in English), who were the district chiefs. There were also elders, the &quot;putús&quot; (wampum belt readers and historians, who also dealt with the treaties with the non-natives and other Native tribes), the women&#x27;s council, and the grand chief. The grand chief was a title given to one of the district chiefs, who was usually from the Mi&#x27;kmaw district of Unamáki or Cape Breton Island. This title was hereditary within a clan and usually passed on to the grand chief&#x27;s eldest son.

On June 24, 1610, Grand Chief Membertou converted to Catholicism and was baptised. He concluded an alliance with the French Jesuits. The Mi&#x27;kmaq, as trading allies of the French, were amenable to limited French settlement in their midst.

Gabriel Sylliboy (1874–1964), a respected Mi&#x27;kmaq religious leader and traditional Grand Chief of the Council, was elected as the Council&#x27;s Grand Chief in 1918. Repeatedly re-elected, he held this position for the rest of his life.

In 1927, Grand Chief Sylliboy was charged by Nova Scotia with hunting muskrat pelts out of season. He was the first to use the rights defined in the Treaty of 1752 in his court defence. He lost his case. In 1985, the Supreme Court of Canada finally recognized the 1752 treaty rights for indigenous hunting and fishing in their ruling on &quot;R. v. Simon&quot;. On the 50th anniversary of Sylliboy&#x27;s death, the Grand Council asked the Nova Scotia government for a pardon for the late Grand Chief. Premier Stephen McNeil granted the posthumous pardon in 2017. Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, John James Grant, McNeil, and the Justice Minister Diana Whalen, pardoned Sylliboy and issued a formal apology: it was the &quot;second posthumous pardon in Nova Scotia&#x27;s history&quot;. His grandson, Andrew Denny, now the Grand Keptin of the Council, said that his grandfather had &quot;commanded respect. Young people who were about to get married would go and ask for his blessing. At the Chapel Island Mission boats would stop if he was crossing.&quot;

Traditionally, the Grand Council met on a small island, &quot;Mniku&quot;, on the Bras d&#x27;Or Lake in Cape Breton. In the early 21st century, this site is now within the reserve known as Chapel Island or &quot;Potlotek&quot;. The Grand Council continues to meet at Mniku to discuss current issues within the Miꞌkmaq Nation.

&quot;Taqamkuk&quot; (Newfoundland) was historically defined as part of Unama&#x27;kik territory. (Later the large island was organized as a separate district in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.)

According to the 2021 census, 9,245 people identified as speakers of the Mi&#x27;kmaq language. 4,910 of which said it was their mother tongue, and 2,595 reported it to be their most often spoken language at home.

===Hieroglyphic writing===
The Mi&#x27;kmaq language was written using Mi&#x27;kmaq hieroglyphic writing using a hieroglyphic system created in 1677 by French Catholic missionary Chrestien Le Clerq. Le Clerq noted that the Mi&#x27;kmaq children were memorizing prayers utilizing the counting of marks, but did not claim to have incorporated any of this system into the hieroglyphs he created. It is likely that this pre-Le Clerq writing system was part of a writing tradition by the Mi&#x27;kmaq similar to that observed in 1651 amongst the Eastern Abenaki of Maine. Today, it is written mainly using letters of the Latin alphabet.

At the Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site, petroglyphs of &quot;life-ways of the Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot;, include written hieroglyphics, human figures, Mi&#x27;kmaq houses and lodges, decorations including crosses, sailing vessels, and animals, etched into slate rocks. These are attributed to the Mi&#x27;kmaq, who have continuously inhabited the area since prehistoric times. The petroglyphs date from the late prehistoric period through the nineteenth century.

Jerry Lonecloud (1854 – 1930, Mi&#x27;kmaq) is considered the &quot;ethnographer of the Mi&#x27;kmaq nation&quot;. In 1912, he transcribed some of the Kejimkujik petroglyphs, and donated his works to the Nova Scotia Museum. He is credited with the first Mi&#x27;kmaq memoir, which was recorded from his oral history in the 1920s.

In the late 1670s, French missionary Chrestien Le Clercq, who was working in the Gaspé Peninsula, was inspired by marks made by a young Mi&#x27;kmaq using charcoal on birchbark. Leclercq created what is now known as Mi&#x27;kmaq hieroglyphs to teach Catholic prayers and hymns to the people in their own form of language.

Christian Kauder was a missionary in &quot;Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki&quot; from 1856 to 1871. He included samples of Mi&#x27;kmaq hieroglyphic writing, such as the Holy Mary Rosary prayer and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, in his German Christian catechism published in 1866.

David L. Schmidt and Murdena Marshall published some of the prayers, narratives, and liturgies represented in hieroglyphs—pictographic symbols in a 1995 book. As noted, the pre-contact Mi&#x27;kmaq utilized some form of writing, but Le Clerq indicated that the hieroglyphs were &quot;formed&quot; by him. French Jesuit missionaries adopted their use to teach Catholic prayers and religion to the Mi&#x27;kmaq. Schmidt and Marshall showed that these hieroglyphics served as a fully functional writing system. They assert it is the oldest writing system for an indigenous language in North America north of Mexico.

===Etymology of the word &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot;===
By the 1980s, the spelling of the ethnonym &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot;, which is preferred by the Mi&#x27;kmaq people, was widely adopted by scholarly publications and the media. It replaced the previous spelling &quot;Micmac&quot;. Although this older spelling is still in use, the Mi&#x27;kmaq consider the spelling &quot;Micmac&quot; to be &quot;tainted&quot; by colonialism. The &quot;q&quot; ending is used in the plural form of the noun, and &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaw&quot; is used as singular of &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot;. It is also used as an adjective, for example, &quot;the Miꞌkmaw nation&quot;.

The Mi&#x27;kmaq prefer to use one of the three current Miꞌkmaq orthographies when writing the language. Spellings used by Mi&#x27;kmaq people include &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot; (singular &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaw&quot;) in Prince Edward Island (&quot;Epekw&#x27;itk&quot;), Nova Scotia (&quot;Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki-Unama&#x27;ki&quot;), and Newfoundland (&quot;K&#x27;taqamkuk&quot;); &quot;Miigmaq&quot; (&quot;Miigmao&quot;) in New Brunswick (&quot;Sipekni&#x27;katik&quot;); &quot;Mi&#x27;gmaq&quot; by the Listuguj Council in Quebec (&quot;Kespek&quot;); and &quot;Mìgmaq&quot; (&quot;Mìgmaw&quot;) in some native literature.

&quot;Lnu&quot; (the adjectival and singular noun, previously spelled &quot;L&#x27;nu&quot;; the plural is &quot;Lnúk&quot;, &quot;Lnu&#x27;k&quot;, &quot;Lnu&#x27;g&quot;, or &quot;Lnùg&quot;) is the term the Mi&#x27;kmaq use for themselves, their autonym, meaning &quot;human being&quot; or &quot;the people&quot;. Members of the Mi&#x27;kmaq historically referred to themselves as &quot;Lnu&quot;, but used the term &quot;níkmaq&quot; (my kin) as a greeting.
The French initially referred to the Mi&#x27;kmaq as &quot;Souriquois&quot; and later as &quot;Gaspesiens&quot;. Adopting a term from the English, they referred to them as &quot;Mickmakis&quot;. The British originally referred to the people as Tarrantines, which appears to have a French basis.

Various explanations exist for the rise of the term &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot;. The &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaw Resource Guide&quot; says that &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot; means &quot;the family&quot;. The Anishinaabe refer to the Mi&#x27;kmaq as &quot;Miijimaa(g)&quot;, meaning &quot;The Brother(s)/Ally(ies)&quot;, with the use of the &quot;nX&quot; prefix &quot;m-&quot;, opposed to the use of &quot;n1&quot; prefix &quot;n-&quot; (i.e. &quot;Niijimaa(g)&quot;, &quot;my brother(s)/comrade(s)&quot;) or the &quot;n3&quot; prefix &quot;w-&quot; (i.e., &quot;Wiijimaa(g)&quot;, &quot;brother(s)/compatriot(s)/comrade(s)&quot;).

Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye was documented as the first European to record the term &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot; for the people, using it in his 1676 memoir. Marion Robertson stated this in the book &quot;Red Earth: Tales of the Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot; (1960s), published by the Nova Scotia Museum, Robertson cites Professor Ganong, who suggested that &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot; was derived from the Mi&#x27;kmaq word &quot;megamingo&quot; (earth). Marc Lescarbot had also suggested this.

The Mi&#x27;kmaq may have identified as &quot;the Red Earth People, or the People of the Red Earth&quot;. &quot;Megumaagee&quot;, the name the Mi&#x27;kmaq used to describe their land, and &quot;Megumawaach&quot;, what they called themselves, were linked to the words &quot;megwaak&quot;, which refers to the colour red, and &quot;magumegek&quot;, &quot;on the earth&quot;. Rand translated &quot;megakumegek&quot; as &quot;red on the earth&quot;, &quot;red ground&quot;, or &quot;red earth&quot;. Other suggestions from Robertson include its origin in &quot;nigumaach&quot;, which means &quot;my brother&quot; or &quot;my friend&quot;, or a term of endearment. Stansbury Hagar suggested in &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq Magic and Medicine&quot; that the word &quot;megumawaach&quot; is from &quot;megumoowesoo&quot;, in reference to magic.

==Geography==

Mi&#x27;kmaw Country, known as Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki, is traditionally divided into seven districts. Prior to the imposition of the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, each district had its own independent government and boundaries. The independent governments had a district chief and a council. The council members were band chiefs, elders, and other worthy community leaders. The district council was charged with performing all the duties of any independent and free government by enacting laws, justice, apportioning fishing and hunting grounds, making war and suing for peace.

===Districts===
The eight Mi&#x27;kmaw districts (including &quot;Ktaqmkuk&quot; which is often not counted) are Epekwitk aq Piktuk (Epegwitg aq Pigtug), Eskikewa&#x27;kik (Esge&#x27;gewa&#x27;gi), Kespek (Gespe&#x27;gewa&#x27;gi), Kespukwitk (Gespugwitg), Siknikt (Signigtewa&#x27;gi), Sipekni&#x27;katik (Sugapune&#x27;gati), Ktaqmkuk (Gtaqamg), and Unama&#x27;kik (Unama&#x27;gi). The orthography between parentheses is the Listuguj orthography used in the Gespe&#x27;gewa&#x27;gi area.

==Current federal and provincial relations with Mi&#x27;kmaq==

===Tripartite Forum===
In 1997, the Mi&#x27;kmaq–Nova Scotia–Canada Tripartite Forum was established. On August 31, 2010, the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia signed a historic agreement with the Mi&#x27;kmaw Nation, establishing a process whereby the federal government must consult with the Miꞌkmaw Grand Council before engaging in any activities or projects that affect the Mi&#x27;kmaq in Nova Scotia. This covers most, if not all, actions these governments might take within that jurisdiction. This is the first such collaborative agreement in Canadian history including all the First Nations within an entire province.

===Marshall decision===
On September 17, 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the treaty rights of Mi&#x27;kmaw Donald Marshall Jr. its landmark &quot;R v Marshall&quot; ruling, which &quot;affirmed a treaty right to hunt, fish and gather in pursuit of a &#x27;moderate livelihood&#x27;.&quot; The Supreme Court also cited Section 35 of the 1982 &quot;Constitution Act&quot; in their 1999 ruling that resulted in Mi&#x27;kmaq, Maliseet, and Peskotomuhkati people the &quot;right to hunt, fish and gather in pursuit of a &#x27;moderate livelihood&#x27; from the resources of the land and waters.&quot; The legal precedent had previously been established in the Treaty of 1752, one in a series of treaties known as the Peace and Friendship Treaties, but was not being respected prior to &quot;R v Marshall&quot;. This resulted in the 1993 charges laid against Marshall Jr. for &quot;fishing eels out of season, fishing without a licence, and fishing with an illegal net&quot;. In the 2018 publication, &quot;Truth and conviction: Donald Marshall Jr. and the Mi&#x27;kmaq quest for justice&quot;, Marshall was quoted as saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t need a licence. I have the 1752 Treaty.&quot; The 1989 Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall Jr. Prosecution resulted in a compensation to Marshall of a lifetime pension of $1.5 million. Marshall used the financial compensation to finance the lengthy and costly Supreme Court case. When Marshall won, 34 Mi&#x27;kmaq and Maliseet First Nations bands were affected in the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and the Gaspé region of Quebec. The West Nova Fishermen&#x27;s Coalition submitted an appeal asking for the Marshall decision to be set aside. In November 17, 1999, released a new ruling (Marshall 2) to clarify that the DFO had the power to regulate the fishery for conservation purposes if it &quot;consulted with the First Nation and could justify the regulations&quot;.

Soon after the September 17 decision, Miramichi Bay—&quot;one of Canada&#x27;s most lucrative lobster fisheries&quot;— became the site of a violent conflict between Mi&#x27;kmaq fishers and non-Mi&#x27;kmaq commercial fishers. Immediately after the ruling, Mi&#x27;kmaq fishers began to lay lobster traps out of season. Incidents such as the Burnt Church Crisis were widely covered by the media from 1999 and 2002. On October 3, 1999, non-Indigenous commercial fishers in 150 boats destroyed hundreds of Mi&#x27;kmaq lobster traps, then returned to shore and vandalized fishing equipment, as well as three fish plants. This was captured and documented in the 2002 National Film Board feature-length documentary &quot;Is the Crown at war with us?&quot; by Alanis Obomsawin. The documentary also described how Ocean and Fisheries department officials seemed to &quot;wage a war&quot; on the Mi&#x27;kmaq fishermen of Burnt Church, New Brunswick with &quot;helicopters, patrol boats, guns, with observation by airplanes and dozens of RCMP officers&quot;. The documentary asks why the fishers were being harassed for &quot;exercising rights that had been affirmed by the highest court in the land.&quot; Following lengthy negotiations with the Mi&#x27;kmaq, the DFO developed the $160 million Marshall Response Initiative, which operated until 2007, through which the DFO offered to purchase over 1,000 commercial fishing licences, including boats and gear, to support the expansion of the Mi&#x27;kmaq lobster fishery. By mid-2000, about 1,400 commercial fishermen stated their intention to retire over 5,000 licences. On August 20, 2001, the DFO issued a temporary license to Burnt Church Mi&#x27;kmaq fishers while negotiations for a more permanent agreement were underway. The DFO license had restrictions that some Burnt Church fishers refused: the fishers could not sell their lobsters, they could only use them for food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) purposes. The &quot;Aboriginal right to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes (FSC)&quot; was confirmed in the landmark 1990 R. v. Sparrow Supreme Court case which cited section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act&quot;, 1982. In May 2003, the House of Commons&#x27; Standing Committee On Fisheries And Oceans chaired by MP Tom Wappel, submitted its report on fisheries issues, which &quot;recommended that all charges stemming from the [confrontation over the lobster fisheries]&quot; be dropped and that the fishers should be compensated by federal government for &quot;their lost traps and boats.&quot; The report said that Mi&#x27;kmaq fishers have the &quot;same season as non-native fishermen&quot; and could not therefore, fish in the fall. It recommended that &quot;native bands be issued licences, which they would distribute to native fishermen.&quot;

On the tenth anniversary of the benchmark decision, &quot;CBC News&quot; reported that &quot;Maritime waters&quot; were &quot;calm a decade after Marshall decision.&quot;

However, by 2020, the &quot;Fish Buyers&#x27; Licensing and Enforcement Regulations&quot;, under the 1996 &quot;N.S. Fisheries and Coastal Resources Act&quot;, remains in effect—as it does in other Atlantic provinces. These regulations do not mention the Mi&#x27;kmaq or the Marshall decision. These regulations prevent Mi&#x27;kmaq lobster fishers from selling their lobster to non-Mi&#x27;kmaq. Mi&#x27;kmaq fishers say that this does not align with the Marshall decision. In 2019, the government of the Listuguj First Nation in the Bay of Chaleur developed their own self-regulated lobster fisheries management plan and opened their own lobster fishery in the fall of 2020. Under the existing Fish Buyers&#x27; Licensing Regulations the self-regulated Listuguj fisheries can harvest, but can only use the lobster for &quot;food, social and ceremonial purposes&quot;.

According to Chief Terry Paul of Membertou First Nation, early in 2020, a negotiator for the DFO had offered Nova Scotia First Nations nearly $87 million for boats, gear, and training, with the condition that the First Nations would not practice their treaty right to earn a moderate livelihood fishing (ie out of the DFO season) for a period of 10 years. The proposal did not define &quot;moderate livelihood&quot;, and was rejected.

On November 9, 2020, a group of Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nations and Premium Brands Holdings Corporation announced their $1 billion purchase of Clearwater Seafoods, which was finalised on January 25, 2021. The group of First Nations includes Sipekne&#x27;katik, We&#x27;koqma&#x27;q, Potlotek, Pictou Landing, and Paqtnkek First Nations, and is led by Membertou and Miapukek First Nations. The purchase represents the &quot;largest investment in the seafood industry by a Canadian Indigenous group&quot;. The harvest of non-Indigenous fishermen in the region will now be purchased by Clearwater Seafoods&#x27; Mi&#x27;kmaq part owners.

===Dispute over rights-based inshore lobster fishery (2020–present)===

Since September 2020, there has been an ongoing lobster fishing dispute between Sipekne&#x27;katik First Nation members of the Mi&#x27;kmaq and non-Indigenous lobster fishers mainly in Digby County and Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia.

====Background====
After Mi&#x27;kmaq chiefs declared a state of emergency in October 2020, the federal government appointed Allister Surette as Federal Special Representative to investigate.

In the March 2021 report&#x27;s backgrounder, Surette cited Macdonald-Laurier Institute&#x27;s Ken Coates who said that Mik&#x27;maq communities had benefitted from improvements resulting from the Marshall decision, as the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) granted access to Mi&#x27;kmaq fishers to the &quot;commercial fishery through communal licences operated by the bands&quot;. Macdonald-Laurier Institute&#x27;s Ken Coates said that the commercial fishing industry had not suffered because of this. Others disagreed, saying that Canada had never fully implemented the Marshall decision, and that, over the decades, various levels of government and authorities mishandled and neglected local concerns related to the implementation of the Marshall decision.

In September 2020, the Sipekne&#x27;katik First Nation developed a fishing plan based on their right to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. They issued seven lobster licenses to band members; each license has 50 tags, representing a combined total of 350 tags. One commercial lobster license represents 350 tags. The lobster fishery they initiated was located &quot;outside of the regulated commercial season in Lobster Fishing Area 34 in St. Marys Bay, Nova Scotia—the &quot;Kespukwitk&quot; (also spelled &quot;Gespogoitnag&quot;) district of &quot;Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki&quot;.

The inshore fishery is the last small-scale fishery in Nova Scotia. St. Marys Bay is part of Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 34, making it the &quot;largest lobster fishing area in Canada with more than 900 licensed commercial fishermen harvesting from the southern tip of Nova Scotia up to Digby in the Bay of Fundy.&quot; It is also &quot;one of the most lucrative fishing areas in Canada&quot;. DFO reported that as of December 2019, there were 979 commercial lobster licenses in LFA 34.

The Sipekneꞌkatik fishing plan &quot;became a flash point&quot; resulting in violent highly-charged conflict pitting non-Miꞌkmaw lobster fishers in the adjacent coastal communities and Mi&#x27;kmaw fishers those carrying out the moderate livelihood fishery.

====Violence====
On September 11, Sipekne&#x27;katik First Nation Chief Michael Sack sent a letter to Premier Stephen McNeil, DFO Minister Bernadette Jordan and Nova Scotia RCMP Commanding Officer Lee Bergerman, calling for them &quot;to uphold the rule of law amid ongoing violence, threats, human rights discrimination and ongoing failure to uphold the 1999 Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. Marshall, recognizing the Mi&#x27;kmaq right to fish and trade.&quot; By that point, vehicles and property belonging to members of the Sipekne&#x27;katik First Nation had already been damaged and stolen, including boats being burned. There were already planned protests by non-Indigenous fishers to block the Mi&#x27;kmaq fishers&#x27; access to several wharves. One such protest took place on September 15 at Saulnierville and Weymouth wharves.

On September 17, Sipekne&#x27;katik launched a &quot;moderate livelihood fishery&quot; with a ceremony at the Saulnierville wharf, the first lobster fishery regulated by Mi&#x27;kmaq in Nova Scotia. On September 18, the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi&#x27;kmaw Chiefs declared a province-wide state of emergency in response to threats by commercial and non-indigenous fishers, including some that had cut the Mi&#x27;kmaw lobster traps. On September 25, the Sipekne&#x27;katik fishery released its proposed regulations allowing the legal sale of seafood harvested under the fishery to Indigenous and non-Indigenous consumers and wholesalers. However, at the time of the announcement, Nova Scotia&#x27;s Fisheries and Coastal Resources Act prohibited anyone in Nova Scotia from purchasing fish from &quot;a person who does not hold a valid commercial fishing license issued by Fisheries and Oceans Canada,&quot; which would include the fishery.

On October 1, Potlotek First Nation and Eskasoni First Nation launched their own moderate livelihood fishery in a celebration at Battery Provincial Park that coincided with Mi&#x27;kmaq Treaty Day. The management plan behind this fishery had been in development for three months, prompted by the seizure of lobster traps by DFO officials. Community licenses issued through this fishery will entitle fishers to 70 tags, and boats will be allowed to carry up to 200 lobster traps each. At the time of the launch of the Potlotek fishery, Membertou was also planning on launching their own fishery, following a similar plan. After the launch of this fishery, DFO officers continued to seize Mi&#x27;kmaq traps.

Harassment around the Sipekne&#x27;katik fishery continued through October. On October 5, Sipekne&#x27;katik fisher Robert Syliboy, a holder of one of the moderate livelihood fishery&#x27;s licenses, found his boat at the Comeauville wharf destroyed in a suspicious fire. On the evening of October 13, several hundred non-Indigenous fishers and their supporters raided two storage facilities in New Edinburgh and Middle West Pubnico that were being used by Mi&#x27;kmaw fishers to store lobsters. During the raids, a van was set aflame, another vehicle was defaced and damaged, lobsters being stored in the facilities were destroyed, and the New Edinburgh facility was damaged, while a Mi&#x27;kmaw fisher was forced to barricade himself inside the facility in Middle West Pubnico. Indigenous leaders called the raids racist hate crimes and called on the RCMP to intervene, citing their slow response on the evening and lack of arrests even a day after the police claimed they &quot;witnessed criminal activity&quot;. Social media posts from the commercial fishers and their supporters claimed that the lobsters taken in the raids were removed as they represented &quot;bad fishing practices&quot; on the part of the Mi&#x27;kmaq, but Sipekne&#x27;katik Chief Mike Sack and a worker at the Middle West Pubnico facility claimed the lobsters that were stored there were caught by the commercial fishers, not Mi&#x27;kmaw. Assembly of First Nations national chief Perry Bellegarde, federal Fisheries minister Bernadette Jordan, and Colin Sproul, president of the Bay of Fundy Inshore Fishermen&#x27;s Association, all condemned the violence. Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil maintained his position that this issue must be solved federally when asked about it at a press conference. Several months later, in January 2021, the manager of the Middle West Pubnico facility, James Muise, made a public post in a Facebook group for commercial fishers, claiming that he gave the people involved in the raids permission to enter the facility and take the lobsters. Muise offered to work with people charged with offenses connected to the raids and try to get those charges dropped.

Chief Mike Sack was sucker punched while trying to give a press conference on October 14. Also during the violence, an elder had sage knocked out of her hand while smudging, and a woman was grabbed by the neck.

On October 15, the Mi&#x27;kmaq Warrior Peacekeepers arrived at the Saulnierville wharf with the intention of providing protection to Miꞌkmaq who were continuing to fish amid the violence.

On Friday, October 16, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his government was &quot;extremely active&quot; in trying to de-escalate the situation. He also stated that he expected the police to be keeping people safe, and acknowledged concerns that the police had not been doing so.

Three days after the initial raids on the storage facilities, on the evening of October 16, the Middle West Pubnico facility was destroyed in a large fire, deemed &quot;suspicious&quot; by the RCMP. One man was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries after the fire, but the RCMP did not provide details regarding the man&#x27;s association to the lobster pound, other than that he was not an employee. The destruction led to further calls from Chief Sack for increased police presence, as well as an appeal from the Maritime Fisherman&#x27;s Union for the federal government to appoint an independent mediator.

On October 16, Mi&#x27;kmaq lobster fishers from the Sipekne&#x27;katik First Nation quickly sold all their lobsters after setting up shop in front of the Province House in Halifax with potential customers lined up around the block. The fishers said they were putting pressure on Premier McNeil to act.

On October 17, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil, released a Twitter statement requesting that the federal government define &quot;what constitutes legal harvesting in a &quot;moderate livelihood&quot; fishery.

On October 21, Sipekne&#x27;katik managed to secure an interim injunction against the restriction of band members&#x27; access to the Saulnierville and Weymouth wharves, as well as the New Edinburgh lobster pound. The motion for the injunction was filed &quot;ex parte&quot; due to the urgency of the situation, as the band was struggling to sell any of their catch in the midst of the violence and protests. The injunction will remain in place until December 15, 2020.

In January 2021, 23 people were charged in connection to the violence at the lobster storage facilities on October 13, 2020: 15 for break-and-enter and 8 for break-and-enter and mischief. Their court date was set for March 29, 2021.

Intimidation over the fishery dispute has continued into 2021. In mid-January, lobster harvester and Sipekne&#x27;katik citizen Jolene Marr, whose brother was surrounded in the West Pubnico lobster pound on October 13, was sent a seven second-long close-up video of a man&#x27;s face that included what &quot;sounds like a racial slur and six gunshots in the background.&quot;

====Legal action====
On March 26, 2021, 43 Mi&#x27;kmaq lobster fishers from the Sipekne&#x27;katik First Nation filed a statement of claim against the attorney general of Canada, the RCMP, the DFO, and 29 non-Indigenous fishers including the Bay of Fundy Inshore Fishermen&#x27;s Association (BFIFA). The claim alleges that the non-Indigenous fishers named as defendants took the law into their own hands and engaged in violence against the moderate livelihood fishery, that they were encouraged to do so by BFIFA, and that the DFO and RCMP contributed to the harm by not intervening in the foreseeable violence.

====Talks with DFO====
On October 23, 2020, the Mi&#x27;kmaq Rights Initiative (known as the KMKNO for &quot;Kwilmu&#x27;kw Maw-klusuaqn Negotiation Office&quot;) announced that talks with the DFO over defining &quot;moderate livelihood&quot; had broken down. The following Wednesday (October 28), Terry Paul, chief of Membertou First Nation, stepped down from his position with KMKNO and the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi&#x27;kmaq Chiefs, saying &quot;[his] confidence in the operations of the organization [sic] have weakened over time,&quot; citing issues of transparency, and preferring to pursue treaty rights negotiations outside of the Assembly. Membertou&#x27;s withdrawal follows Sipekne&#x27;katik&#x27;s own withdrawal earlier in the month on October 6, leaving the Assembly as a representative of 10 of the 13 Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nation bands (Millbrook having also withdrawn earlier). According to Paul, when he talked with the other ANSMC Chiefs about his decision, there seemed to be a willingness to deal with the issues he had identified in the negotiation process, so that he could rejoin shortly.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan sent a letter to Chief Mike Sack on March 3, 2021, outlining the terms under which a moderate livelihood fishery could be negotiated, and what the federal government would be &quot;prepared&quot; to allow; the letter proposed balancing &quot;additional First Nations access through already available licences&quot; and stated that &quot;these fisheries will operate within established seasons.&quot; These terms were rejected by Chief Sack, who stated that &quot;we have a management plan that is better for conservation than theirs is, so we&#x27;re going to follow our own plan.&quot;

===Truth and Reconciliation Commission===
In 2005, Nova Scotian Mi&#x27;kmaw Nora Bernard led the largest class-action lawsuit in Canadian history, representing an estimated 79,000 survivors of the Canadian Indian residential school system. The Government of Canada settled the lawsuit for upwards of .

In autumn 2011, there was an Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission that travelled to various communities in Atlantic Canada, who were all served by the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, the sole residential school for the region. In his 2004 book entitled &quot;Legacies of the Shubenacadie Residential School&quot;, journalist Chris Benjamin wrote about the &quot;raw wounds&quot; of Mi&#x27;kmaw children who attended the Shubenacadie institution in the period spanning over three decades, from 1930 to 1967.

===Mi&#x27;kmaq Kina&#x27; matnewey===
The first Mi&#x27;kmaq-operated school in Nova Scotia—the &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq Kina&#x27; matnewey&quot;—was established in 1982 he result of a collaboration between the Mi&#x27;kmaw community and the Nova Scotia government. The school is the most successful First Nation Education Program in Canada, according to Benjamin.

By 1997, all Mi&#x27;kmaq on reserves were given the responsibility for their own education. By 2014, there were 11 band-run schools in Nova Scotia, and the province has the highest rate of retention of aboriginal students in schools in Canada. More than half the teachers are Mi&#x27;kmaq. From 2011 to 2012 there was a 25% increase in Mi&#x27;kmaw students going to university. Atlantic Canada has the highest rate of aboriginal students attending university in the country.

==History==

===Pre-contact period===
In southwestern Nova Scotia, there is archaeological evidence that traces traditional land use and resources to at least 4,000 years. In Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site, there are canoe routes that have been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people travelling from the Bay of Fundy to the Atlantic ocean. Research published in 1871 showed that some Mi’kmaq believed they had emigrated from the west, and then lived alongside the Kwēdĕchk. According to Mi&#x27;kmaw traditions recorded by S. T. Rand, the Kwēdĕchk were the original inhabitants of the land. The two tribes engaged in a war that lasted &quot;many years&quot;, and involved the &quot;slaughter of men, women, and children, and torture of captives&quot;, and the eventual displacement of the Kwēdĕchk by the victorious Mi&#x27;kmaq.

In his Memorial University Masters thesis, Mi&#x27;kmaq elder Roger Lewis investigated how pre-contact Mi&#x27;kmaq populations had a reciprocal relationship with the environment that was reflected in subsistence fishing, hunting and gathering, as well as in settlement locations. Lewis, who has held the position of ethnology curator at the Nova Scotia Museum in Halifax, since 2007 focused his MA research specifically on pre-contact fish weirs in southwestern Nova Scotia.

In the chapter &quot;Late Prehistory of the East Coast&quot; in the Smithsonian&#x27;s 1978 &quot;Handbook of North American Indians&quot;, archaeologist Dean Snow says that the fairly deep linguistic split between the Mi&#x27;kmaq and the Eastern Algonquians to the southwest suggests the Mi&#x27;kmaq developed an independent prehistoric cultural sequence in their territory. It emphasized maritime orientation, as the area had relatively few major river systems. In the chapter &quot;Early Indian-European Contact&quot; in the 1978 &quot;Handbook&quot;, ethnologist T. J. Brasser, described how pre-contact small semi-nomadic bands of a few patrilineally related families indigenous people who lived in a climate unfavorable for agriculture, had subsisted on fishing and hunting. Developed leadership did not extend beyond hunting parties. In the same 1978 &quot;Handbook&quot;, anthropologist Philip Bock described the annual cycle of seasonal movement of precontact Mi&#x27;kmaq. Bock wrote that the Mi&#x27;kmaq had lived in dispersed interior winter camps and larger coastal communities during the summer. The spawning runs of March began their movement to converge on smelt spawning streams. They next harvested spawning herring, gathered waterfowl eggs, and hunted geese. By May, the seashore offered abundant cod and shellfish, and coastal breezes brought relief from the biting black flies, deer flies, midges and mosquitoes of the interior. Autumn frost killed the biting insects during the September harvest of spawning American eels. Smaller groups would disperse into the interior where they hunted moose and caribou. The most important animal hunted by the Mi&#x27;kmaq was the moose, which was used in every part: the meat for food, the skin for clothing, tendons and sinew for cordage, and bones for carving and tools. Other animals hunted/trapped included deer, bear, rabbit, beaver and porcupine.

Braser described the first contact between the Mi&#x27;kmaq and early European fishermen. These fishermen salted their catch at sea and sailed directly home with it, but they set up camps ashore as early as 1520 for dry-curing cod. During the second half of the century, dry curing became the preferred preservation method. Brasser said that trading furs for European trade goods had changed Miꞌkmaw social perspectives. Desire for trade goods encouraged the men to devote a larger portion of the year away from the coast, trapping in the interior. Trapping non-migratory animals, such as beaver, increased awareness of territoriality. Trader preferences for good harbors resulted in greater numbers of Miꞌkmaq gathering in fewer summer rendezvous locations. This in turn encouraged their establishing larger bands, led by the ablest trade negotiators.

According to the Nova Scotia Museum, bear teeth and claws were used as decoration in regalia. The women used porcupine quills to create decorative beadwork on clothing, moccasins, and accessories. The weapon used most for hunting was the bow and arrow. The Mi&#x27;kmaq made their bows from maple. They ate fish of all kinds, such as salmon, sturgeon, lobster, squid, shellfish, and eels, as well as seabirds and their eggs. They hunted marine mammals such as porpoises, whales, walrus, and seals.

Miꞌkmaw territory was the first portion of North America that Europeans exploited at length for resource extraction. Reports by John Cabot, Jacques Cartier, and Portuguese explorers about conditions there encouraged visits by Portuguese, Spanish, Basque, French, and English fishermen and whalers, beginning in the 16th century.

European fishing camps traded with Mi&#x27;kmaw fishermen, and trading rapidly expanded to include furs, according to Thomas B. Costain, (1885–1965), a journalist who wrote historical novels. By 1578, some 350 European ships were operating around the Saint Lawrence estuary. Most were independent fishermen, but increasing numbers were exploring the fur trade.

===17th and 18th centuries===

====Colonial wars====
In the wake of King Philip&#x27;s War between English colonists and Native Americans in southern New England (which included the first military conflict between the Mi&#x27;kmaq and New England), the Mi&#x27;kmaq became members of the &quot;Wapnáki&quot; (Wabanaki Confederacy), an alliance with four other Algonquian-language nations: the Abenaki, Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, and Maliseet. The Wabanaki Confederacy was allied with the Acadian people.

Over a period of seventy-five years, during six wars in Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki, the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region (See the four French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale&#x27;s War and Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War). France lost military control of Acadia in 1710 and political claim (apart from Cape Breton) by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht with England.

But the Mi&#x27;kmaq were not included in the treaty, and never conceded any land to the British. In 1715, the Mi&#x27;kmaq were told that the British now claimed their ancient territory by the Treaty of Utrecht. They formally complained to the French commander at Louisbourg about the French king transferring the sovereignty of their nation when he did not possess it. They were informed that the French had claimed legal possession of their country for a century, on account of laws decreed by kings in Europe, that no land could be legally owned by any non-Christian, and that such land was therefore freely available to any Christian prince who claimed it. Mi&#x27;kmaw historian Daniel Paul observes that, &quot;If this warped law were ever to be accorded recognition by modern legalists they would have to take into consideration that, after Grand Chief Membertou and his family converted to Christianity in 1610, the land of the Mi&#x27;kmaq had become exempt from being seized because the people were Christians. However, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that a modern government would fall back and try to use such uncivilized garbage as justification for non-recognition of aboriginal title.&quot;

Along with Acadians, the Mi&#x27;kmaq used military force to resist the founding of British (Protestant) settlements by making numerous raids on Halifax, Dartmouth, Lawrencetown, and Lunenburg. During the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War between France and Britain in Europe, the Mi&#x27;kmaq assisted the Acadians in resisting the British during the Expulsion. The military resistance was reduced significantly with the French defeat at the Siege of Louisbourg (1758) in Cape Breton. In 1763, Great Britain formalized its colonial possession of all of Miꞌkmaki in the Treaty of Paris.

====Covenant Chain of Peace and Friendship Treaties====
Between 1725 and 1779, the Mi&#x27;kmaq, Wolastoqey (Maliseet), and Peskotomuhkati (Passamaquoddy) signed numerous treaties, commonly referred to as the Covenant Chain of Peace and Friendship Treaties, through which they entered into a &quot;peaceful relationship with the British Crown.&quot; The Mi&#x27;kmaq assert that through these treaties—which were referenced as legal precedent by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;R v Marshall&quot;—the Mi&#x27;kmaq &quot;did not cede or give up their land title and other rights.&quot;

Some historians have asserted that first treaty signed in 1725, after Father Rale&#x27;s War, did not cede hunting, fishing, and gathering rights. The Halifax Treaties (1760–61), marked the end of warfare between the Mi&#x27;kmaq and the British.

The 1752 Peace and Friendship Treaty Between His Majesty the King and Jean-Baptiste Cope, on behalf of the Shubenacadie Mi&#x27;kmaq has been cited in the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s 1985 decision in &quot;R. v. Simon&quot;. In his 2002, book on the Marshall case, historian William Wicken said that there is no written documentation to support this assertion that Cope made the treaty on behalf of all the Miꞌkmaq. has been cited in the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s 1985 decision in &quot;R. v. Simon&quot;. With the signing of various treaties, the 75 years of regular warfare ended in 1761 with the Halifax Treaties.

Although the treaties of 1760–61 contain statements of Mi&#x27;kmaw submission to the British crown, later statements made by Miꞌkmaw reveal that they intended a friendly and reciprocal relationship, according to the 2009 book, &quot;Nova Scotia: a pocket history&quot;, by Saint Mary&#x27;s University history professor, John G. Reid and Brenda Conroy. In the early 1760s, there were approximately 300 Mi&#x27;kmaw fighters in the region and thousands of British soldiers. The goals of the Mi&#x27;kmaw treaty negotiators engaged in the 1760 Halifax treaty negotiations, were to make peace, establish secure and well-regulated trade in commodities such as furs, and begin an ongoing friendship with the British crown. In return, the Mi&#x27;kmaq offered friendship and tolerance of limited British settlement, although without any formal land surrender, according to Reid and Connor. To fulfill the reciprocity intended by the Mi&#x27;kmaq, that any additional British settlement of land would have to be negotiated, and accompanied by giving presents to the Mi&#x27;kmaq. The documents summarizing the peace agreements failed to establish specific territorial limits on the expansion of British settlements, but assured the Mi&#x27;kmaq of access to the natural resources that had long sustained them along the regions&#x27; coasts and in the woods. Their conceptions of land use were quite different. In his 2003 book about the British expulsion of the Acadians, University of Cincinnati history professor, Geoffrey Plank, described the relationship between the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadians as strong. The Mi&#x27;kmaq believed they could share their traditional lands with both the British and the Acadians—with the Mi&#x27;kmaq hunting as usual, and getting to the coast for seafood.

The arrival of the New England Planters and United Empire Loyalists in greater number put pressure on land use and the treaties. This migration into the region created significant economic, environmental and cultural pressures on the Mi&#x27;kmaq. The Mi&#x27;kmaq tried to enforce the treaties through threat of force. At the beginning of the American Revolution, many Mi&#x27;kmaw and Maliseet tribes supported the Americans against the British. They participated in the Maugerville Rebellion and the Battle of Fort Cumberland in 1776. Mi&#x27;kmaw delegates concluded the first international treaty, the Treaty of Watertown, with the United States soon after it declared its independence in July 1776. These delegates did not officially represent the Mi&#x27;kmaw government, although many individual Mi&#x27;kmaq did privately join the Continental Army as a result. In June 1779, Mi&#x27;kmaq in the Miramichi valley of New Brunswick attacked and plundered some of the British in the area. The following month, British Captain Augustus Harvey, in command of HMS &quot;Viper&quot;, arrived and battled with the Mi&#x27;kmaq. One Mi&#x27;kmaw was killed and 16 were taken prisoner to Quebec. The prisoners were eventually taken to Halifax. They were released on 28 July 1779 after signing the Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown.

As their military power waned in the beginning of the 19th century, the Mi&#x27;kmaw people made explicit appeals to the British to honor the treaties and reminded them of their duty to give &quot;presents&quot; to the Mi&#x27;kmaq in order to occupy Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki. In response, the British offered charity or, the word most often used by government officials, &quot;relief&quot;. The British said the Mi&#x27;kmaq must give up their way of life and begin to settle on farms. Also, they were told they had to send their children to British schools for education.

Gabriel Sylliboy was the first Mi&#x27;kmaw elected as grand chief in 1919 and the first to fight for treaty recognition—specifically, the Treaty of 1752—in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.

In 1986, the first Treaty Day was celebrated by Nova Scotians on October 1, 1986 in recognition of the treaties signed between the British Empire and the Mi&#x27;kmaw people.

The treaties were only formally recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada once they were enshrined in Section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act&quot; of 1982. The first Treaty Day occurred the year after the Supreme Court upheld the Peace Treaty of 1752 signed by Jean-Baptiste Cope and Governor Peregrine Hopson.

===19th century===

====Royal Acadian School====
Walter Bromley was a British officer and reformer who established the Royal Acadian School and supported the Mi&#x27;kmaq over the thirteen years he lived in Halifax (1813–1825). Bromley devoted himself to the service of the Miꞌkmaw people. The Mi&#x27;kmaq were among the poor of Halifax and in the rural communities. According to historian Judith Finguard, his contribution to give public exposure to the plight of the Mi&#x27;kmaq &quot;particularly contributes to his historical significance&quot;. Finguard writes:

====Mi&#x27;kmaq Missionary Society====
Silas Tertius Rand in 1849 help found the Mi&#x27;kmaq Missionary Society, a full-time Mi&#x27;kmaw mission. Basing his work in Hantsport, Nova Scotia, where he lived from 1853 until his death in 1889, he travelled widely among Mi&#x27;kmaw communities, spreading the Christian faith, learning the language, and recording examples of the Mi&#x27;kmaw oral tradition. Rand produced scriptural translations in Mi&#x27;kmaq and Maliseet, compiled a Mi&#x27;kmaq dictionary and collected numerous legends, and through his published work, was the first to introduce the stories of Glooscap to the wider world. The mission was dissolved in 1870. After a long period of disagreement with the Baptist church, he eventually returned to the church in 1885.

====Mi&#x27;kmaq hockey sticks====
The Miꞌkmaq practice of playing ice hockey appeared in recorded colonial histories from as early as the 18th century. Since the nineteenth century, the Mi&#x27;kmaq were credited with inventing the ice hockey stick. The oldest known hockey stick was made between 1852 and 1856. Recently, it was sold for US$2.2 million. The stick was carved by Miꞌkmaq from Nova Scotia, who made it from hornbeam, also known as ironwood.

In 1863, the Starr Manufacturing Company in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, began to sell the Mic-Mac hockey sticks nationally and internationally. Hockey became a popular sport in Canada in the 1890s. Throughout the first decade of the 20th century, the Mic-Mac hockey stick was the best-selling hockey stick in Canada. By 1903, apart from farming, the principal occupation of the Mi&#x27;kmaq on reserves throughout Nova Scotia, and particularly on the Shubenacadie, Indian Brook, and Millbrook Reserves, was producing the Mic-Mac hockey stick. The department of Indian Affairs for Nova Scotia noted in 1927 that the Mi&#x27;kmaq remained the &quot;experts&quot; at making hockey sticks. The Mi&#x27;kmaq continued to make hockey sticks until the 1930s, when the product was industrialized.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Jerry Lonecloud worked with historian and archivist Harry Piers to document the ethnography of the Mi&#x27;kmaw people in the early 20th century. Lonecloud wrote the first Mi&#x27;kmaw memoir, which his biographer entitled &quot;Tracking Dr. Lonecloud: Showman to Legend Keeper&quot;. Historian Ruth Holmes Whitehead writes, &quot;Ethnographer of the Mi&#x27;kmaq nation could rightly have been his epitaph, his final honour.&quot;

====World Wars====
Over 150 Mi&#x27;kmaw men signed up during World War I. During the First World War, thirty-four out of sixty-four male Mi&#x27;kmaq from Lennox Island First Nation, Prince Edward Island enlisted in the armed forces, distinguishing themselves particularly in the Battle of Amiens. In 1939, over 250 Miꞌkmaq volunteered in World War II. (In 1950, over 60 Mi&#x27;kmaq enlisted to serve in the Korean War.)

====Mi&#x27;kmaq of Newfoundland====
When Newfoundland joined Canada in confederation in 1949, political leader (later Premier) Joey Smallwood declared that there were &quot;no Indians in Newfoundland.&quot; This ultimately led to the Mi&#x27;kmaq people of Newfoundland not receiving indian status or recognition as First Nations that other indigenous groups in Canada did in the years following.

In 1972, activists formed the Native Association of Newfoundland and Labrador as the main organization representing the Mi&#x27;kmaq, Innu, and Inuit peoples of Newfoundland and Labrador. After the Labrador Innu and Inuit left the Association in 1975, the organization was renamed as the Federation of Newfoundland Indians. The FNI included six Mi&#x27;kmaq bands (Elmastogoeg First Nations, Corner Brook Indian Band, Flat Bay Indian Band, Gander Bay Indian Band, Glenwood Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nation, and the Port au Port Indian Band). The provincial government supported the FNI.

The federal government approved only the petition for recognition made by the Mi&#x27;kmaq at Conne River. In 1987, the Miawpukek Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nation was recognized under the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, and their community of Conne River was classified as reserved land for the Mi&#x27;kmaq.

Recognition for the remainder of Newfoundland&#x27;s Mi&#x27;kmaq was a much longer process. Minister David Crombie was willing to work with the FNI and the government of Newfoundland, but the provincial government considered it to be a federal matter.

In 2003, Minister Andy Scott was presented with a report recommending a First Nations band without any reserved land to represent the Mi&#x27;kmaq of Newfoundland. An Agreement-in-principle was reached in 2006, which the FNI accepted in 2007. The federal government ratified it in 2008.

In 2011, the Government of Canada announced recognition by an order-in-council to a group in Newfoundland and Labrador called the Qalipu First Nation. The new band, which is landless, had accepted 25,000 applications to become part of the band by October 2012. In total over 100,000 applications were sent in to join the Qalipu, equivalent of one-fifth of the province&#x27;s population. In response, parliament passed Bill C-25, authorizing it to review all applications and retroactively reject some, based on criteria similar to those used in the &quot;R v Powley&quot; case that defined rights for the Métis people. Several Mi&#x27;kmaw institutions, including the Grand Council, had argued that the Qalipu Miꞌkmaq Band did not have legitimate aboriginal heritage and was accepting too many members.

In 2017, only 18,044 people were eligible for Band membership. In 2018, the Qalipu First Nation announced that the updated Founding Members List for the Band had been adopted by way of an Order in Council which came into effect on June 25, 2018. The 2018 Band list included 18,575 members. In November 2019, after concerns about legitimacy had been addressed, the Qalipu First Nation was accepted by the Mi&#x27;kmaq Grand Council as being part of the Mi&#x27;kmaq Nation. Qalipu Chief Mitchell stated, &quot;Our inclusion into the AFN, APC and acknowledgement by the Mi&#x27;kmaq Grand Council are important to us; it is part of our reconciliation as Mi&#x27;kmaq people. Friendships are being formed, and relationships are being established. It is a good time for the Qalipu First Nation.&quot; By 2021, nearly 24,000 people were recognized as founding members, in 67 Newfoundland communities and abroad.

The Friends of Qalipu Advocacy Association is currently taking Qalipu First Nation (and its precursor) to court over the enrolment process.

==Religion, spirituality, and tradition==
===Current forms of Mi&#x27;kmaw faith===
Some Mi&#x27;kmaw people practice the Catholic faith while some only practice traditional Mi&#x27;kmaw beliefs. However, many have adopted both because of the compatibility between both systems.

===Oral traditions in Mi&#x27;kmaw culture===
The Mi&#x27;kmaw people had very little in the way of physical recording and storytelling; petroglyphs, while used, are believed to have been rare. In addition, it is not believed that pre-contact Mi&#x27;kmaq had any form of written language. As such, almost all of Mi&#x27;kmaw traditions were passed down orally, primarily via storytelling. There were traditionally three levels of oral traditions: religious myths, legends, and folklore. This includes Mi&#x27;kmaw creation stories and myths which account for the organization of the world and society; for instance, how men and women were created and why they are different from one another. The most well known Mi&#x27;kmaw myth is that of Glooscap. Good storytellers are highly prized by the Mi&#x27;kmaq, as they provide important teachings that shape who a person grows to be, and are sources of great entertainment.

One myth explains that the Mi&#x27;kmaq once believed that evil and wickedness among men is what causes them to kill each other. This causes great sorrow to the creator-sun-god, who weeps tears that become rains sufficient to trigger a deluge. The people attempt to survive the flood by traveling in bark canoes, but only a single old man and woman survive to populate the earth.

===Spiritual sites===
One spiritual capital of the Mi&#x27;kmaq Nation is Mniku, the gathering place of the Mi&#x27;kmaw Grand Council or Santé Mawiómi, Chapel Island in Bras d&#x27;Or Lake of Nova Scotia. The island is also the site of the St. Anne Mission, an important pilgrimage site for the Mi&#x27;kmaq. The island has been declared a historic site.

===Ethnobotany===
&quot;Abies balsamea&quot; (balsam fir) is traditionally used for a variety of purposes by the Mi&#x27;kmaq. They use the buds, cones and inner bark for diarrhea; the gum for burns, colds, fractures, sores and wounds; the cones for colic; the buds as a laxative; and the bark for gonorrhea. They use the boughs to make beds, the bark to make a beverage, and the wood for kindling and fuel.

==First Nation subdivisions==
Mi&#x27;kmaw names in the following table are spelled according to several orthographies. The Mi&#x27;kmaw orthographies in use are Mi&#x27;kmaw hieroglyphic writing, the orthography of Silas Tertius Rand, the Pacifique orthography, and the most recent Smith-Francis orthography. The latter has been adopted throughout Nova Scotia and in most Mi&#x27;kmaw communities.

==Demographics==
The pre-contact population is estimated at 3,000–30,000. In 1616, Father Biard believed the Mi&#x27;kmaw population to be in excess of 3,000, but he remarked that, because of European diseases, there had been large population losses during the 16th century. Smallpox and other endemic European infectious diseases, to which the Mi&#x27;kmaq had no immunity, wars and alcoholism led to a further decline of the native population. It reached its lowest point in the middle of the 17th century. Then the numbers grew slightly again, before becoming apparently stable during the 19th century. During the 20th century, the population was on the rise again. The average growth from 1965 to 1970 was about 2.5%.

==Commemorations==
The Mi&#x27;kmaw people have been commemorated in numerous ways, including HMCS Mi&#x27;kmaq (R10), and place names such as Lake Mi&#x27;kmaq, and the Mic Mac Mall.

<text>The Turul is a mythological bird of prey, mostly depicted as a falcon, in Hungarian tradition and Turkic tradition, and a national symbol of Hungarians.

==Origin==
The Turul is probably based on a large falcon. The Hungarian language word &quot;turul&quot; meant one kind of falcon and the origin of the word is currently thought to be most likely Turkic (&quot;Clauson 1972: 472&quot;.) (&quot;Róna-Tas et al. 2011:2: 954-56)&quot;), which is the language of origin of over 10% of words in modern Hungarian lexicon and the exonym &quot;Hungarian&quot; and the word &quot;Hun&quot;. &quot;Toġrïl&quot; or &quot;toğrul&quot; means a medium to large bird of prey of the family Accipitridae, goshawk or red kite. In Hungarian the word &quot;sólyom&quot; means falcon, and there are three ancient words describing different kinds of falcons: &quot;kerecsen&quot; [Greek κερχνηίς] (saker falcon), &quot;zongor&quot; [Turkish &quot;sungur&quot; = gyrfalcon] (which survives in the male name &quot;Csongor&quot;) and &quot;turul&quot;.

In the legend of Emese, recorded in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; and the &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot;, the &quot;turul&quot; is mentioned as occurring in a dream of Emese, when she was already pregnant.
In older literature, this was interpreted as &quot;impregnation&quot;, but the text is clear. The Turul&#x27;s role is one of a protector spirit, that protects the infant Álmos, from harm. This is a very similar motif to the role of the Simurgh in the Iranian epic Shahnameh. In a second dream by the leader of the Hungarian tribes, in which eagles (the emblem of the Pechenegs, enemies of the Hungarians) attacked their horses and the Turul came and saved them. The image of the Turul and its role is similar to that of the Norse Vedfolnir, which like it perched on the tree of life. The Huns reportedly also used the image of the eagle, which for them symbolized the leader. The image of a bird of prey was extremely popular in Saka-Scythian culture. More broadly, this image was common among the nomads of Central Asia. Rather than belonging to a specific ethnic group, it was widespread across the steppe, and the union of a falcon and a woman is &quot;firmly located in a shamanic religio-mythical universe.&quot; A prominent example among similar legends is that of the Mongols, contained in &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, where Genghis Khan&#x27;s mother-in-law dreams that an eagle holding the sun and the moon in its claws lands on her hand, in anticipation of the birth of the Mongolian royal dynasty. In some parts of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz carry falcons inside the yurt during childbirth, because their eyes are said to stave off demons that attack pregnant women during childbirth. Macdonald calls it a &quot;practical use&quot; of the falcons&#x27; association with fertility.

A pair of silver disk with Turul motive was found in Rakamaz, Hungary from a 10th century Hungarian cemetery. The most beautiful ornament of noble Hungarian women was a pair of decorative disks hanging from the end of the hair braid. 

==Turul dynasty==
In Hungarian tradition, it originated as the clan symbol used in the 9th and 10th centuries by the ruling Árpád dynasty. The Árpád dynasty was the ruling dynasty of the Principality of Hungary in the 9th and 10th centuries and of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1000 to 1301. The Árpád dynasty is also referred to as the Turul dynasty. 

The &quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot; mentioned that the Árpád dynasty descended from the &quot;gens&quot; (clan) Turul, and the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; recorded that the Árpád&#x27;s totemic ancestor was the Turul.

In the legend of Emese, recorded in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; and the &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot;, the Turul is mentioned as occurring in a dream of Emese, when she was already pregnant.

According to the &quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot;, King Attila had the Turul bird on his shield and it was the military badge of the Hungarians until the time of Prince Géza.


== Coat of arms of Transylvania ==

The first heraldic representations of Transylvania date from the 16th century. The Diet of 1659 codified the representation of the Union of the Three Nations in Transylvania&#x27;s coat of arms. It depicted a black eagle, a Turul on a blue background, representing the Hungarians, the Sun and the Moon representing the Székelys, and seven red towers on a yellow background representing the seven fortified cities of the Transylvanian Saxons. The flag and coat of arms of Transylvania were granted by Queen Maria Theresa in 1765, when she established a Grand Principality within the Habsburg monarchy.

== Modern use ==
The Turul is used as in the design of coats of arms of the Hungarian Defence Forces, the Counter Terrorism Centre and the Office of National Security. The central element of the emblem of the Hungarian Defence Forces is the Turul bird with extended wings holding the sword of King Saint Stephen in its claws.

There were 3 large Turul statues, each with a wingspan of 15 metres, in Kingdom of Hungary (before the country had its borders reconfigured by the Treaty of Trianon). The last of the three stands on a mountain near Tatabánya, Hungary, but the other two were destroyed. It is the largest bird statue in Europe, and the largest bronze statue in Central Europe.
There remain at least 195 Turul statues in Hungary, as well as 48 in Romania (32 in Transylvania and 16 in Partium), 8 in Slovakia, 7 in Serbia, 5 in Ukraine, 1 in Austria and 1 in Croatia. One of the most recently erected, , on St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Day, is in Hungary&#x27;s Ópusztaszer National Heritage Park.

Some of the Kingdom of Hungary postage stamps issued after 1900 feature the Turul.

<text>Ida Haendel, (15 December 1928 - or 1923, the exact year remains uncertain 1 July 2020) was a world renowned Polish-British-Canadian violinist. Haendel was a child prodigy, her career spanning over seven decades. She also became an influential teacher.

==Early career==
Born in 1928 to a Polish Jewish family in Chełm, Poland, her talents were evident when she picked up her sister&#x27;s violin at the age of three. Major competition wins paved the way for success. Performing the Beethoven Violin Concerto, she won the Warsaw Conservatory&#x27;s Gold Medal and the first Huberman Prize in 1933, at 5 years old. At the age of seven she competed against towering virtuosos such as David Oistrakh and Ginette Neveu to become a laureate of the first Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition, in 1935.

These accolades enabled her to study with the esteemed pedagogues Carl Flesch in London and George Enescu in Paris. During World War II she played in factories and for British and American troops and performed in Myra Hess&#x27;s National Gallery concerts. In 1937 her London debut under the baton of Sir Henry Wood brought her worldwide critical acclaim, while the conductor linked her playing to his memories of Eugène Ysaÿe. Her lifelong association with the Proms resulted in 68 appearances.

==Performing career==
After performing the Sibelius concerto in Helsinki in 1949, she received a letter from the composer. &quot;You played it masterfully in every respect,&quot; Sibelius wrote, adding: &quot;I congratulate myself that my concerto has found an interpreter of your rare standard.&quot;
Haendel made annual tours of Europe, and also appeared regularly in South America and Asia. 

Living in Montreal, Canada from 1952 to 1989, her collaborations with Canadian orchestras made her a key celebrity of Canadian musical life. As a British subject resident in Canada, she acquired Canadian citizenship. Performing with the London Philharmonic in 1973, she was the first Western soloist invited to China following the Cultural Revolution. Although she worked particularly with Sergiu Celibidache, she was also associated with Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir Adrian Boult, Sir Eugene Goossens, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Charles Munch, Otto Klemperer, Sir Georg Solti, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Bernard Haitink, Rafael Kubelík, Lorin Maazel, Zubin Mehta and Sir Simon Rattle, with whom she recorded the Elgar and Sibelius violin concertos.

Esteemed music critic Tully Potter said of her, &quot;In concertos, she ruled supreme among female players.&quot;

In 1993, she made her concert début with the Berliner Philharmoniker. In 2006 she performed for Pope Benedict XVI at the former Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. Later engagements include a tribute concert at London&#x27;s National Gallery in honour of Dame Myra Hess&#x27;s War Memorial Concerts and an appearance at the Sagra Musicale Malatestiana Festival in 2010. Haendel&#x27;s violin was a Stradivarius of 1699. Haendel had lived in Miami, Florida, for many years and was actively involved in the Miami International Piano Festival.

Haendel performed many concerts and tours with pianist Ronald Turini, a native of Montreal, including sonatas of Brahms and Franck.

==Recordings==
Haendel&#x27;s major label recordings have earned critical praise. The Sibelius Society awarded her the Sibelius Medal in 1982. She said she always had a passion for German music. Her recording career began on 10 September 1940 for Decca, initially of short solo pieces and chamber works. In April 1945, she recorded both the Tchaikovsky and Mendelssohn concertos followed in 1947 by the Dvořák concerto. Her recording career spanned nearly 70 years for major labels including EMI and Harmonia Mundi. In 1948–49 she recorded Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto, with Rafael Kubelik conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra. In 2014, Supraphon issued a 5-CD set of her live and studio recordings made in Prague between 1957 and 1965, including a famous one of Lalo&#x27;s Symphonie espagnole conducted by Karel Ančerl. 

Other acclaimed recordings are her renditions of the Brahms Violin Concerto (including one with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sergiu Celibidache, his last studio recording), and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Basil Cameron. Geoffrey Norris, music critic for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, praised her 1993 recording of the Sibelius concerto, later released by Testament Records, as &quot;simply mind-blowing.&quot; Among her later recordings were the Sonatas and partitas for solo violin, BWV1001-1006 by J. S. Bach, recorded at Studio 1 Abbey Road, London, in 1995 recorded in analogue and issued by Testament.

She was equally passionate about the music of the 20th century, including Béla Bartók, Benjamin Britten and William Walton. Among her premiere performances were Luigi Dallapiccola&#x27;s &quot;Tartiniana Seconda&quot;, and Allan Pettersson&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2, which was dedicated to her. Paying tribute to her teacher George Enescu, her Decca recording of his Violin Sonata with Vladimir Ashkenazy in 2000 earned her a Diapason d&#x27;Or.

==Teaching==
Haendel&#x27;s emotive performances have inspired a generation of new violinists, including Anne-Sophie Mutter, David Garrett and Maxim Vengerov.

In August 2012 she was honorary artist at the Cambridge International String Festival. She was a regular adjudicator for violin competitions, including the Sibelius, the Carl Flesch, the Benjamin Britten, and the International Violin Competition. She returned to her native Poland to judge the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in Poznań on a number of occasions, and was honorary chairwoman in 2011.

==Death==
Haendel died at a nursing home in Pembroke Park, Florida on 1 July 2020, aged 91. According to her nephew, she had been suffering from kidney cancer at the time of her death.

==Honours and awards==
In 1991 she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. She received honorary doctorates from the Royal College of Music, London, in 2000 and from McGill University of Montreal in 2006.

==Bibliography==
Haendel published her autobiography, &quot;Woman With Violin&quot;, in 1970 (Gollancz; ).

==Television==
Her life has been the subject of several television documentaries, including &quot;Ida Haendel: A Voyage of Music&quot; (1988), &quot;I Am The Violin&quot; (2004), and &quot;Ida Haendel: This Is My Heritage&quot; (2011). In June 2009, she appeared on a Channel 4 television programme, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Musical Prodigies&quot;, in which she advised the then 16-year-old British composer Alex Prior on which children to choose to play his composition.

<text>Jacques Thibaud (; 27 September 18801 September 1953) was a French violinist.

==Biography==
Thibaud was born in Bordeaux and studied the violin with his father before entering the Paris Conservatoire at the age of thirteen. In 1896 he jointly won the conservatory&#x27;s violin prize with Pierre Monteux (who later became a famous conductor). He had to rebuild his technique after being injured in World War I. In 1943 he and Marguerite Long established the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud International Competition for violinists and pianists, which takes place each year in Paris. From 2011, it has included singers and is now known as the Long-Thibaud-Crespin Competition, in honour of the soprano Régine Crespin.

Thibaud was noted not only for his work as a soloist, but also for his performances of chamber music, particularly in a piano trio with the pianist Alfred Cortot and cellist Pablo Casals. He undertook concert tours with pianist Yves Nat and George Enescu. He was a friend of violinist Eugène Ysaÿe, who dedicated his 2nd Sonata for solo violin to him. Among his students were Manuel Quiroga (the dedicatee of Ysaÿe&#x27;s 6th solo sonata), Eric Rosenblith, Joan Field, Rachel Steinman Clarke, Stephan Hero (see Jose Iturbi) and Yfrah Neaman.

On 1 September 1953, Jacques Thibaud tragically died in the crash of Air France Flight 178, along with all 41 other passengers. The aircraft, registered as F-BAZZ, was on its final approach to Nice when it struck Mount Cimet in the French Alps. Thibaud was traveling to a performance in Tokyo, and his prized 1720 Stradivarius violin was destroyed in the crash. The accident investigation established &quot;controlled flight into terrain (CFIT)&quot; as the cause.

<text>Jascha Heifetz (; December 10, 1987) was a Russian-American violinist, widely regarded as one of the greatest violinists of all time. Born in Vilnius, he was soon recognized as a child prodigy and was trained in the Russian classical violin style in St. Petersburg. Accompanying his parents to escape the violence of the Russian Revolution, he moved to the United States as a teenager, where his Carnegie Hall debut was rapturously received. Fritz Kreisler, another leading violinist of the twentieth century, said after hearing Heifetz&#x27;s debut, &quot;We might as well take our fiddles and break them across our knees.&quot;

By the age of 18, Heifetz was the highest-paid violinist in the world. He had a long and successful concert career, including wartime service with the United Service Organizations (USO). After an injury to his right (bowing) arm in 1972, he switched his focus to teaching.

==Early life==
Heifetz was born into a Lithuanian-Jewish family in Vilnius (which was then part of the Russian Empire, and is currently the capital of Lithuania).
His father, Reuven Heifetz, was a local violin teacher and served as the concertmaster of the Vilnius Theatre Orchestra for one season before the theatre closed down. While Jascha was an infant, his father did a series of tests, observing how his son responded to his violin playing. This convinced him that Jascha had great potential, and before Jascha was two years old, his father bought him a small violin, and taught him bowing and simple fingering.

In 1906, at the age of five, Heifetz entered the local music school in Vilna where he studied with Ilya Malkin. Recognized as a child prodigy, he made his public debut at seven, in Kovno (now Kaunas, Lithuania) playing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. In 1910, he entered the violin class of Ionnes Nalbandian at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and later studied under Leopold Auer.

He played in Germany and Scandinavia, and met Fritz Kreisler for the first time in a Berlin private house, in a &quot;private press matinee on May 20, 1912. The home was that of Arthur Abell, the pre-eminent Berlin music critic for the American magazine, &quot;Musical Courier&quot;. Among other noted violinists in attendance was Fritz Kreisler. After the 12-year-old Heifetz performed the Mendelssohn violin concerto, Abell reported that Kreisler said to all present, &#x27;We may as well break our fiddles across our knees.&#x27;&quot;

Heifetz visited much of Europe while still in his teens. In April 1911, he performed in an outdoor concert in St. Petersburg before 25,000 spectators; there was such a reaction that police officers needed to protect the young violinist after the concert. In 1914, he performed with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Arthur Nikisch. The conductor said he had never heard such an excellent violinist.

==Career==

To avoid the Russian Revolution, Heifetz and his family left Russia in 1917, traveling by rail to the Russian far east and then by ship to the United States, arriving in San Francisco. On October 27, 1917, Heifetz played for the first time in the United States, at Carnegie Hall in New York City, and became an immediate sensation.
Fellow violinist Mischa Elman in the audience asked &quot;Do you think it&#x27;s hot in here?&quot;, whereupon the pianist Leopold Godowsky, in the next seat, replied, &quot;Not for pianists.&quot;

In 1917, Heifetz was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music, by the fraternity&#x27;s Alpha chapter at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. At 16, he was perhaps the youngest person ever elected to membership in the organization. Heifetz remained in the country and became a United States citizen in 1925. A story circulates that tells of an interaction with one of the Marx Brothers: when he told the brother (usually Groucho or Harpo) that he had been earning his living as a musician since the age of seven, he received the reply, &quot;Before that, I suppose, you were just a bum.&quot;

On April 17, 1926, Heifetz performed at Ein Harod, then the center of Mandatory Palestine’s kibbutz movement. 

In May 1945 Heifetz played with his son for Ivan Konev and Omar Bradley in Kassel.

In 1954, Heifetz began working with pianist Brooks Smith, who was Heifetz&#x27;s accompanist for many years until he changed to Ayke Agus as his accompanist in retirement. He was also accompanied in concert for more than 20 years by Emanuel Bay, another immigrant from Russia and a personal friend. Heifetz&#x27;s musicianship was such that he would demonstrate to his accompanist how he wanted passages to sound on the piano, and would even suggest which fingerings to use.

After the seasons of 1955–56, Heifetz announced that he would sharply curtail his concert activity, saying &quot;I have been playing for a very long time.&quot; In 1958, he tripped in his kitchen and fractured his right hip, resulting in hospitalization at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and a near fatal staphylococcus infection. He was invited to play Beethoven at the United Nations General Assembly, and entered leaning on a cane. By 1967, Heifetz had considerably curtailed his concert performances.

===Technique and timbre===
Heifetz was &quot;regarded as the greatest violin virtuoso since Paganini&quot;, wrote Lois Timnick of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;He set all standards for 20th-century violin playing...everything about him conspired to create a sense of awe&quot;, wrote music critic Harold Schonberg of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;The goals he set still remain, and for violinists today it&#x27;s rather depressing that they may never really be attained again&quot;, wrote violinist Itzhak Perlman.

Virgil Thomson described Heifetz as being the master of playing &quot;silk underwear music&quot;, a characterization he did not intend as a compliment. Other critics argue that he infused his playing with feeling and reverence for the composer&#x27;s intentions. His style of playing was highly influential in defining the way modern violinists approached the instrument. His use of rapid vibrato, emotionally charged portamento, fast tempi, and superb bow control coalesced to create a highly distinctive sound that makes Heifetz&#x27;s playing instantly recognizable to aficionados. Itzhak Perlman, who himself is known for his rich warm tone and expressive use of portamento, described Heifetz&#x27;s tone as like &quot;a tornado&quot; because of its emotional intensity. Perlman said that Heifetz preferred to record relatively close to the microphone—and as a result, one would perceive a somewhat different tone quality when listening to Heifetz during a concert hall performance.

Heifetz was very particular about his choice of strings. He used a silver-wound Tricolore gut G string, plain unvarnished gut D and A strings, and a Goldbrokat medium steel E string, and employed clear Hill-brand rosin sparingly. Heifetz believed that playing on gut strings was important in rendering an individual sound.

===Early recordings===
Heifetz made his first recordings in Russia during 1910–11, while still a student of Leopold Auer. The existence of these recordings was not generally known until after Heifetz&#x27;s death, when several sides, including François Schubert&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Abeille&quot;, were reissued on an LP included as a supplement to &quot;The Strad&quot; magazine.

On November 9, 1917, shortly after his Carnegie Hall debut, Heifetz made his first recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company/RCA Victor where he remained for most of the rest of his career. On October 28, 1927, Heifetz was the starring act at the grand opening of Tucson, Arizona&#x27;s now-historic Temple of Music and Art. For several years, in the 1930s, Heifetz recorded primarily for HMV/EMI in the UK because RCA Victor cut back on expensive classical recording sessions during the Great Depression; these HMV discs were issued in the United States by RCA Victor. Heifetz often enjoyed playing chamber music. Various critics have blamed his limited success in chamber ensembles to the fact that his artistic personality tended to overwhelm his colleagues. Collaborations include his 1941 recordings of piano trios by Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms with cellist Emanuel Feuermann and pianist Arthur Rubinstein as well as a later collaboration with Rubinstein and cellist Gregor Piatigorsky, with whom he recorded trios by Maurice Ravel, Tchaikovsky, and Felix Mendelssohn. Both formations were sometimes referred to as the &quot;Million Dollar Trio&quot;. Heifetz also recorded some string quintets with violinist Israel Baker, violists William Primrose and Virginia Majewski, and Piatigorsky.

Heifetz recorded the Beethoven Violin Concerto in 1940 with the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini, and again in stereo in 1955 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Munch. A live performance of an NBC radio broadcast from April 9, 1944, of Heifetz playing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with Toscanini and the NBC Symphony has also been released, unofficially.

He performed and recorded Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#x27;s Violin Concerto at a time when Korngold&#x27;s scoring of films for Warner Bros. prompted many classical musicians to develop the opinion Korngold was not a &quot;serious&quot; composer and to avoid his music in order to avoid being associated with him.

==World War II==
During the war, Heifetz commissioned a number of pieces, including the Violin Concerto by William Walton. He also arranged a number of pieces, such as &quot;Hora Staccato&quot; by Grigoraș Dinicu, a Romanian whom Heifetz is rumoured to have called the greatest violinist he had ever heard. Heifetz also played and composed for the piano. He performed mess hall jazz for soldiers at Allied camps across Europe during the Second World War, and under the alias Jim Hoyl he wrote a hit song, &quot;When You Make Love to Me (Don&#x27;t Make Believe)&quot;, which was sung by Bing Crosby.

===Decca recordings===

From 1944 to 1946, largely as a result of the American Federation of Musicians recording ban (which began in 1942), Heifetz recorded with American Decca because the company settled with the union in 1943, well before RCA Victor resolved their dispute with the musicians. He recorded primarily short pieces, including his own arrangements of music by George Gershwin and Stephen Foster; these were pieces he often played as encores in his recitals. He was accompanied on the piano by Emanuel Bay or Milton Kaye. Among the more uncommon discs featured one of Decca&#x27;s popular artists, Bing Crosby, in the &quot;Lullaby&quot; from Benjamin Godard&#x27;s opera &quot;Jocelyn&quot; and &quot;Where My Caravan Has Rested&quot; (arranged by Heifetz and Crosby) by Hermann Löhr (1871–1943); Decca&#x27;s studio orchestra was conducted by Victor Young on July 27, 1946, session. Heifetz soon returned to RCA Victor, where he continued to make recordings until the early 1970s.

==Later recordings==
Returning to RCA Victor in 1946, Heifetz continued to record extensively for the company, including solo, chamber, and concerto recordings, primarily with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Charles Munch and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner.
In 2000, RCA released a double CD compilation entitled &quot;Jascha Heifetz – The Supreme&quot;. This release provides a sampling of Heifetz&#x27;s major recordings, including the 1955 recording of Brahms&#x27;s Violin Concerto with Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the 1957 recording of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Violin Concerto (with the same forces); the 1959 recording of Sibelius&#x27;s Violin Concerto with Walter Hendl and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the 1961 recording of Max Bruch&#x27;s &quot;Scottish Fantasy&quot; with Sir Malcolm Sargent and the New Symphony Orchestra of London; the 1963 recording of Glazunov&#x27;s A minor Concerto with Walter Hendl and the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra (drawn from New York musicians); the 1965 recording of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Three Preludes&quot; (transcribed by Heifetz) with pianist Brooks Smith; and the 1970 recording of Bach&#x27;s unaccompanied &quot;Chaconne&quot; from the Partita No. 2 in D minor.

===Third Israel tour===

On his third tour to Israel in 1953, Heifetz included the Violin Sonata by Richard Strauss in his recitals. At the time, many considered Strauss and a number of other German intellectuals Nazis, or at least Nazi sympathizers, and Strauss works were unofficially banned in Israel along with those of Richard Wagner. Despite the fact that the Holocaust had occurred less than ten years earlier and a last-minute plea from Ben-Zion Dinur, the Israeli Minister of Education, the defiant Heifetz argued, &quot;The music is above these factors … I will not change my program. I have the right to decide on my repertoire.&quot; In Haifa his performance of the Strauss sonata was greeted with applause, however in Tel Aviv it was followed by dead silence.

Heifetz was attacked after his recital in Jerusalem outside his hotel by a young man who struck Heifetz&#x27;s violin case with a crowbar, prompting Heifetz to use his bow-controlling right hand to protect his priceless violins. The attacker escaped and was never found. The attack has since been attributed to the Kingdom of Israel militant group. The incident made headlines and Heifetz defiantly announced that he would not stop playing the Strauss. Threats continued to come, however, and he omitted the Strauss from his next recital without explanation. His last concert was cancelled after his swollen right hand began to hurt. He left Israel and did not return until 1970.

==Personal life==
Heifetz married twice for 17 years each. His first wife was silent film actress Florence Vidor, the ex-wife of film director King Vidor. Florence was 33 and Jascha was 27 when they married in August 1928, with the Jewish media commenting that she was a Christian from Texas marrying a Russian Jew. Florence brought her nine-year-old daughter, Suzanne Vidor, into the marriage. The union produced one daughter, Josefa Heifetz, born in 1930, and a son named Robert Joseph Heifetz, born in 1932. Jascha Heifetz filed for divorce at the end of 1945 in Santa Ana, California.

Heifetz married a second time, wedding Frances Spiegelberg (1911-2000) in January 1947 in Beverly Hills. Frances was a society lady from New York who also had a previous marriage with two children, ending in divorce. Their son Joseph &quot;Jay&quot; Heifetz was born in September 1948 in Los Angeles. Heifetz divorced her in 1963, with temporary alimony ordered by the court in January, and the divorce finalized in December.

Heifetz enjoyed sailing off the coast of Southern California, and he was a stamp collector. He played tennis and ping-pong, and amassed a personal library of books.

==Later life==
After an only partially successful operation on his right shoulder in 1972, Heifetz ceased giving concerts and making records. His prowess as a performer remained, and he still played privately until the end—but his bow arm was affected, and he could never again hold the bow as high as before.

Late in life, Heifetz was known as a dedicated teacher and a champion of socio-political causes. He publicly advocated to establish 9-1-1 as an emergency phone number, and crusaded for clean air. He and his students at the University of Southern California protested smog by wearing gas masks, and in 1967, he converted his Renault passenger car into an electric vehicle.

Heifetz taught the violin extensively, holding master classes first at UCLA, then at the University of Southern California, where the faculty included renowned cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and violist William Primrose. For a few years in the 1980s, he also held classes in his private studio at home in Beverly Hills. His teaching studio can be seen today in the main building of the Colburn School and serves as an inspiration to the students there. During his teaching career Heifetz taught, among others, Erick Friedman, Pierre Amoyal, Adam Han-Gorski, Rudolf Koelman, Endre Granat, Teiji Okubo, Eugene Fodor, Paul Rosenthal, Ilkka Talvi and Ayke Agus.

===Death===
Heifetz died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, on December 10, 1987, at the age of 86 following a fall in his home.

==Legacy==
Heifetz owned the 1714 &quot;Dolphin Stradivarius&quot;, the 1731 &quot;Piel&quot; Stradivarius, the 1736 Carlo Tononi, and the 1742 &quot;ex David&quot; Guarneri del Gesù, the last of which he preferred and kept until his death. The Dolphin Strad is currently owned by the Nippon Music Foundation and is on loan to Ray Chen. The Heifetz Tononi violin, used at his 1917 Carnegie Hall debut, was left in his will to Sherry Kloss, his Master-Teaching Assistant, with &quot;one of my four good bows&quot;. Violinist Kloss wrote &quot;Jascha Heifetz Through My Eyes&quot;, and is a co-founder of the Jascha Heifetz Society.

The famed Guarneri is now in the San Francisco Legion of Honor Museum, as instructed by Heifetz in his will, and may only be taken out and played &quot;on special occasions&quot; by deserving players. The instrument has recently been on loan to San Francisco Symphony&#x27;s concertmaster Alexander Barantschik, who featured it in 2006 with Andrei Gorbatenko and the San Francisco Academy Orchestra. In 1989, Heifetz received a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

===Family===
Heifetz&#x27;s first child, Josefa, is a lexicographer, the author of the &quot;Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure and Preposterous Words&quot;. Her married name is Josefa Heifetz Byrne.

Heifetz&#x27;s second child, Robert, picked up a love of sailing from his father. He taught urban planning at several colleges and universities. He was a peace activist who protested US military intervention around the world, and encouraged peace talks between Israel and Palestine. He died of cancer in 2001.

Heifetz&#x27;s third child, known as Jay, is a professional photographer. He was head of marketing for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Hollywood Bowl, and the chief financial officer of Paramount Pictures&#x27; Worldwide Video Division. He lives and works in Fremantle, Western Australia.

Heifetz&#x27;s grandson is musician Daniel Mark &quot;Danny&quot; Heifetz, born in 1964, who served as a long-time drummer for several bands, best known for his decade with Mr. Bungle during 1988–1999.

==Filmography==
Heifetz played a featured role in the movie &quot;They Shall Have Music&quot; (1939), directed by Archie Mayo and written by John Howard Lawson and Irmgard von Cube. He played himself, stepping in to save a music school for poor children from foreclosure. He later appeared in the film, &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot; (1947), performing an abridged version of the first movement of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Violin Concerto, with the orchestra led by Fritz Reiner. In 1951, he appeared in the film &quot;Of Men and Music&quot;. In 1962, he appeared in a televised series of his master classes, and, in 1971, &quot;Heifetz on Television&quot; aired, an hour-long color special in which he performed a series of short works: the &quot;Scottish Fantasy&quot; by Max Bruch, and the Chaconne from the Partita No. 2 by J.S.Bach. Heifetz conducted the orchestra, as the surviving video recording documents.

<doc id="312285" wikidata="Q860434" url="?curid=312285" title="Jade Emperor">
<text>In the myths and folk religion of Chinese culture, the Jade Emperor or Yudi is one of the representations of the primordial god.

In Taoist theology, he is the assistant of Yuanshi Tianzun, who is one of the Three Pure Ones, the three primordial emanations of the Tao. However, some Taoists in history were skeptical of his benevolence because his buildings and infrastructure in heaven and earth were sometimes seen as interfering with the many natural laws or dao.

He is often identified with Śakra in Chinese Buddhist cosmology and identified with Yu the Great in Chinese mythology.

The Jade Emperor is known by many names, including Yu, Heavenly Grandfather (, &quot;&quot;), which originally meant &quot;Heavenly Duke&quot;, which is used by commoners; the Jade Lord; the Highest Emperor; Great Emperor of Jade ( , or ).

==Chinese mythology==

There are many stories in Chinese mythology involving the Jade Emperor.

He can also be regarded as a traditional figure among the White Lotus secret society.

===Origin===
It was said that Jade Emperor was originally the crown prince of the kingdom of Pure Felicity and Majestic Heavenly Lights and Ornaments. At birth, he emitted a wondrous light that filled the entire kingdom. When he was young, he was kind, intelligent and wise. He devoted his entire childhood to helping the needy (the poor and suffering, the deserted and single, the hungry and disabled). Furthermore, he showed respect and benevolence to both men and creatures.
After his father died, he ascended the throne. He made sure that everyone in his kingdom found peace and contentment. After that, he told his ministers that he wished to cultivate Tao on the Bright and Fragrant Cliff.

After 1,750 eons, each eon lasting for 129,600 years (3602 years), he attained Golden Immortality. After another one hundred million years of cultivation, he finally became the Jade Emperor. (Using the given figures, this period before his becoming the Jade Emperor lasted for a total of about 327 million years.) 

===Vanquishing evil===
One of the myths describes how the Jade Emperor became the monarch of all the deities in heaven. It is one of the few myths in which the Jade Emperor really shows his power.

In the beginning of time, the earth was a very difficult place to live, much harsher than it is now. People had to deal with a variety of monstrous beings, and they did not have many gods to protect them; in addition, many powerful demons were defying the immortals of heaven. The Jade Emperor was an ordinary immortal who roamed the earth helping as many people as he could. He was saddened because his powers could only ease the suffering of humans. He retreated to a mountain cave to cultivate his Tao. He passed 3,200 trials, each trial lasting about 3 million years.

On earth at this time, a powerful, evil entity had the ambition to conquer the immortals and gods in heaven and proclaim sovereignty over the entire universe. This evil entity also went into retreat and meditation to expand its power, though later than the Jade Emperor did. He passed through 3,000 trials, each trial lasting about 3 million years. After its final trial, it felt confident that no one could defeat it. It re-entered the world and recruited an army of demons with the purpose of attacking heaven.

The immortals, being aware of the threat, gathered themselves and prepared for war. The gods were unable to stop the powerful demon and it defeated them all.

The Jade Emperor finished his cultivation during this war. When he was changing the land to make it more liveable for men and repelling a variety of monsters, he saw an evil glow radiating from heaven and knew something was amiss. He ascended and saw that the evil entity was too powerful to be stopped by the gods. He challenged it, and they fought. Mountains shook and rivers and seas toppled. Due to his deeper and wiser cultivation, his benevolence instead of his might, the Jade Emperor won the battle. After the evil entity was defeated, its army was scattered by the gods and immortals.

Because of his noble and benevolent deeds, the gods, immortals, and humans proclaimed the Jade Emperor the supreme sovereign of all.

===Creation===
The world started with &quot;wuji&quot; (, nothingness) according to the Chinese creation myth. The Jade Emperor was the head of the pantheon, but not responsible for creation.

In another creation myth, the Jade Emperor fashioned the first humans from clay and left them to harden in the sun. Rain deformed some of the figures, which gave rise to human sickness and physical abnormalities. (The most common alternative Chinese creation myth states that human beings were once fleas on the body of Pangu.)

In another myth, Nüwa fashions men out of the mud from the Yellow River by hand. Those she made became the richer people of the earth. After getting tired of it, she dipped her scarf into the mud and swung it around. The drops that fell from the scarf became the poorer humans.

===&quot;The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl&quot;===

In another story, popular throughout Asia and with many differing versions, the Jade Emperor has a daughter named Zhinü ( or Chih&#x27;nü, literally: weaver girl). She is most often represented as responsible for weaving colorful clouds in the heaven. In some versions, she is the Goddess Weaver, daughter of the Jade Emperor and the Celestial Queen Mother, who weaves the Silver River (known in the West as the Milky Way), which gives light to heaven and earth. In other versions, she is a seamstress who works for the Jade Emperor.

Every day Zhinü descended to earth with the aid of a magical robe to bathe. One day, a lowly cowherd named Niu Lang () spotted Zhinü as she bathed in a stream. Niu Lang fell instantly in love with her and stole her magic robe which she had left on the bank of the stream, leaving her unable to escape back to Heaven. When Zhinü emerged from the water, Niu Lang grabbed her and carried her back to his home.

When the Jade Emperor heard of this matter, he was furious but unable to intercede, since in the meantime his daughter had fallen in love and married the cowherd. As time passed, Zhinü grew homesick and began to miss her father. One day, she came across a box containing her magic robe which her husband had hidden. She decided to visit her father back in Heaven, but once she returned, the Jade Emperor summoned a river to flow across the sky (the Milky Way), which Zhinü was unable to cross to return to her husband. The Emperor took pity on the young lovers, and so once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, he allows them to meet on a bridge over the river.

The story refers to constellations in the night sky. Zhinü is the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra east of the Milky Way, and Niu Lang is the star Altair in the constellation of Aquila west of the Milky Way. Under the first quarter moon (7th day) of the seventh lunar month (around August), the lighting condition in the sky causes the Milky Way to appear dimmer, hence the story that the two lovers are no longer separated on that one particular day each year.

The seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar is a holiday in China called Qixi Festival, which is a day for young lovers much like Valentine&#x27;s Day in the West. In Japan, it is called Tanabata (star day). In Korea, it is called Chilseok. In Vietnam, it is called Thất Tịch and if it rains on that day, it is said to be Zhinü crying tears of happiness for being reunited with her husband.

===The Chinese Zodiac===

There are several stories as to how the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac were chosen. In one, the Jade Emperor, although having ruled Heaven and Earth justly and wisely for many years, had never had the time to actually visit the Earth personally. He grew curious as to what the creatures looked like. Thus, he asked all the animals to visit him in heaven. The Cat, being the most handsome of all animals, asked his friend the Rat to wake him on the day they were to go to Heaven so he wouldn&#x27;t oversleep. The Rat, however, was worried that he would seem ugly compared to the Cat, so he didn&#x27;t wake the cat. Consequently, the Cat missed the meeting with the Jade Emperor and was replaced by the Pig. The Jade Emperor was delighted with the animals and so decided to divide the years up amongst them. When the cat learned of what had happened, he was furious with the Rat and that, according to the story, is why cats and Rats are enemies to this day. The Cat can be seen as the domesticated Tiger or leopard the third of the animals in the classical Chinese Zodiac text.

===&quot;The Four Dragons&quot;===
Once a great drought had spread across the land. Four dragons from the sea noticed the plight of the people and traveled to beseech The Jade Emperor in the Heavenly Palace to bring the rains to the people. He was very busy ruling the heavens, earth, and sea and distractedly agreed to send the rains on the next day if they would return to the sea, but soon after the dragons departed, he forgot his promise.

After ten days, the rains still did not come and the people began to die of starvation. The dragons could not simply stand by and do nothing, and so they decided to use their bodies to capture great masses of water from the sea, taking it upon themselves to bring the rain. The people were grateful and prayed their thanks to the Jade Emperor, who soon discovered what the dragons had done, and became angry that they intervened without his blessing.

The Jade Emperor ordered Mountain God to trap the four dragons. However, from each mountain that trapped a dragon there sprang a new river. From Yellow Dragon came the Yellow River, from Long Dragon the Yangtze River, from Black Dragon the Amur River, and from Pearl Dragon the Pearl River. The rivers thereafter flowed from west to east and north to south, the dragons ensuring that the people of China would never be without water again.

===His predecessor and successor===
The Jade Emperor was originally the assistant of the Divine Master of the Heavenly Origin, Yuanshi Tianzun. Yuanshi Tianzun is said to be the supreme beginning, the limitless and eternal creator of Heaven and Earth, who picked Yu-huang, or the Jade Emperor, as his personal successor.

The Jade Emperor will eventually be succeeded by the Heavenly Master of the Dawn of Jade of the Golden Door (). The characters for both are stamped on the front of the arms of his throne.

In two folk automatic writing texts produced in 1925 and 1972, Guan Yu became the 18th Jade Emperor in about 1840 AD; however, some have disagreed that Guan Yu has succeeded, and thus the Jade Emperor and Guan Yu are often worshiped separately. In Tienti teaching, the reigning Jade Emperor has 55 predecessors. However this is from the point of view of Chinese Folk religion, and many orthodox Taoists do not believe these claims to be true.

==Worship and festivals==
Elements from the supreme god Shangdi and his worship were incorporated into theology about the Jade Emperor and the two were often thought to be the same being.

The Jade Emperor&#x27;s Birthday () is said to be the ninth day of the first lunar month. On this day, Taoist temples hold a Jade Emperor ritual (, Mandarin: &quot;&quot;; Hokkien: &quot;pài Thinn-kong&quot;, literally &quot;heaven worship&quot;) at which priests and laymen prostrate themselves, burn incense and make food offerings.

In the morning of this birthday, Chinese, Taiwanese as well as Hokkien and Peranakan Malaysian Chinese and Singaporean Chinese who practice Buddhism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions set up an altar table with 3 layers: one top (containing offertories of six vegetables (), noodles, fruits, cakes, &quot;tangyuan&quot;, vegetable bowls, and unripe betel, all decorated with paper lanterns) and two lower levels (containing the five sacrifices and wines) to honor the deities below the Jade Emperor. The household then kneels three times and kowtows nine times to pay homage and wish him a long life.

In Penang, Malaysia, a focal point of the Jade Emperor&#x27;s Birthday celebrations is Thni Kong Tnua, which gained worldwide fame as one of the featured locations for &quot;The Amazing Race 16&quot;. The temple, built in 1869, is located at the foot of Penang Hill at the Air Itam suburb near George Town, Penang&#x27;s capital city. Aside from Thni Kong Tnua, the Chew Jetty in the heart of George Town is another focal point of the Jade Emperor&#x27;s Birthday celebrations; the festivities in this particular location was captured for a 2014 Malaysian film, &quot;The Journey&quot;.

Yuk Wong Kung Tin (Cantonese romanisation) () also known as Yuk Wong Po Tin () is a temple in A Kung Ngam, Hong Kong, dedicated to the Jade Emperor. In the mid 19th century, people from Huizhou and Chaozhou mined stones in the hill for the development of the central urban area. They set up a shrine to worship Yuk Wong. At the beginning of the 20th century, the shrine was developed into a small temple and was renovated many times. The latest renovation was in 1992.

Early Catholic missionaries to China wrote often about the Jade Emperor. They noticed that, &quot;The stories of Jesus and the Jade Sovereign are, in certain aspects, quite similar. In both cases it is claimed that a god incarnated as a human being.&quot; On the other hand, they denounced the cult of the Jade Emperor as &quot;superstitious,&quot; and compared unfavorably the &quot;legends&quot; about the Jade Emperor with what they claimed was a solid historical record documenting the existence and life of Jesus.

In 2005, roughly 2% of Chinese folk practitioners believed in the Jade Emperor.

<doc id="312293" wikidata="Q576478" url="?curid=312293" title="Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)">
<text>In complex analysis, Liouville&#x27;s theorem, named after Joseph Liouville (although the theorem was first proven by Cauchy in 1844), states that every bounded entire function must be constant. That is, every holomorphic function formula_1 for which there exists a positive number formula_2 such that formula_3 for all formula_4 is constant. Equivalently, non-constant holomorphic functions on formula_5 have unbounded images.

The theorem is considerably improved by Picard&#x27;s little theorem, which says that every entire function whose image omits two or more complex numbers must be constant.

== Statement ==
Liouville&#x27;s theorem: Every holomorphic function formula_6 for which there exists a positive number formula_2 such that formula_3 for all formula_4 is constant.

More succinctly, Liouville&#x27;s theorem states that every bounded entire function must be constant.

== Proof ==

This important theorem has several proofs.

A standard analytical proof uses the fact that holomorphic functions are analytic. 

\,d\zeta&lt;/math&gt;

and formula_10 is the circle about 0 of radius formula_11. Suppose formula_1 is bounded: i.e. there exists a constant formula_2 such that formula_14 for all formula_15. We can estimate directly

: formula_16

where in the second inequality we have used the fact that formula_17 on the circle formula_10. (This estimate is known as Cauchy&#x27;s estimate.) But the choice of formula_19 in the above is an arbitrary positive number. Therefore, letting formula_19 tend to infinity (we let formula_19 tend to infinity since formula_1 is analytic on the entire plane) gives formula_23 for all formula_24. Thus formula_25 and this proves the theorem.
Another proof uses the mean value property of harmonic functions.
The proof can be adapted to the case where the harmonic function formula_1 is merely bounded above or below. See Harmonic function#Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

== Corollaries ==

===Fundamental theorem of algebra===
There is a short proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra using Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

===No entire function dominates another entire function===
A consequence of the theorem is that &quot;genuinely different&quot; entire functions cannot dominate each other, i.e. if formula_1 and formula_28 are entire, and formula_29 everywhere, then formula_30 for some complex number formula_31. Consider that for formula_32 the theorem is trivial so we assume formula_33. Consider the function formula_34. It is enough to prove that formula_35 can be extended to an entire function, in which case the result follows by Liouville&#x27;s theorem. The holomorphy of formula_35 is clear except at points in formula_37. But since formula_35 is bounded and all the zeroes of formula_28 are isolated, any singularities must be removable. Thus formula_35 can be extended to an entire bounded function which by Liouville&#x27;s theorem implies it is constant.

===If &quot;f&quot; is less than or equal to a scalar times its input, then it is linear===
Suppose that formula_1 is entire and formula_42, for formula_43. We can apply Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula; we have that

:formula_44

where formula_45 is the value of the remaining integral. This shows that formula_46 is bounded and entire, so it must be constant, by Liouville&#x27;s theorem. Integrating then shows that formula_1 is affine and then, by referring back to the original inequality, we have that the constant term is zero.

===Non-constant elliptic functions cannot be defined on the complex plane===
The theorem can also be used to deduce that the domain of a non-constant elliptic function formula_1 cannot be formula_5. Suppose it was. Then, if formula_50 and formula_51 are two periods of formula_1 such that formula_53 is not real, consider the parallelogram formula_54 whose vertices are 0, formula_50, formula_51, and formula_57. Then the image of formula_1 is equal to formula_59. Since formula_1 is continuous and formula_54 is compact, formula_59 is also compact and, therefore, it is bounded. So, formula_1 is constant.

The fact that the domain of a non-constant elliptic function formula_1 cannot be formula_5 is what Liouville actually proved, in 1847, using the theory of elliptic functions. In fact, it was Cauchy who proved Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

===Entire functions have dense images===
If formula_1 is a non-constant entire function, then its image is dense in formula_5. This might seem to be a much stronger result than Liouville&#x27;s theorem, but it is actually an easy corollary. If the image of formula_1 is not dense, then there is a complex number formula_69 and a real number 
formula_70 such that the open disk centered at formula_69 with radius formula_19 has no element of the image of formula_1. Define 

:formula_74

Then formula_28 is a bounded entire function, since for all formula_15,

:formula_77

So, formula_28 is constant, and therefore formula_1 is constant.

== On compact Riemann surfaces ==
Any holomorphic function on a compact Riemann surface is necessarily constant.

Let formula_80 be holomorphic on a compact Riemann surface formula_2. By compactness, there is a point formula_82 where formula_83 attains its maximum. Then we can find a chart from a neighborhood of formula_84 to the unit disk formula_85 such that formula_86 is holomorphic on the unit disk and has a maximum at formula_87, so it is constant, by the maximum modulus principle.

== Remarks ==

Let formula_88 be the one-point compactification of the complex plane formula_5. In place of holomorphic functions defined on regions in formula_5, one can consider regions in formula_88. Viewed this way, the only possible singularity for entire functions, defined on formula_92, is the point formula_93. If an entire function formula_1 is bounded in a neighborhood of formula_93, then formula_93 is a removable singularity of formula_1, i.e. formula_1 cannot blow up or behave erratically at formula_93. In light of the power series expansion, it is not surprising that Liouville&#x27;s theorem holds.

Similarly, if an entire function has a pole of order formula_100 at formula_93 —that is, it grows in magnitude comparably to formula_102 in some neighborhood of formula_93 
—then formula_1 is a polynomial. This extended version of Liouville&#x27;s theorem can be more precisely stated: if formula_105 for formula_106 sufficiently large, then formula_1 is a polynomial of degree at most formula_100. This can be proved as follows. Again take the Taylor series representation of formula_1,

:formula_110

The argument used during the proof using Cauchy estimates shows that for all formula_111,

:formula_112

So, if formula_113, then

:formula_114

Therefore, formula_115.

Liouville&#x27;s theorem does not extend to the generalizations of complex numbers known as double numbers and dual numbers.

<text>An avalanche photodiode (APD) is a highly sensitive type of photodiode, which in general are semiconductor diodes that convert light into electricity via the photovoltaic effect. APDs use materials and a structure optimised for operating with high reverse bias voltage, approaching the reverse breakdown voltage, such that charge carriers generated by the photovoltaic effect are multiplied by an avalanche breakdown; thus they can be used to detect relatively small amounts of light.

From a functional standpoint, they can be regarded as the semiconductor analog of photomultiplier tubes; unlike solar cells, they are not optimised for &quot;generating&quot; electricity from light but rather for &quot;detection&quot; of incoming photons. Typical applications for APDs are laser rangefinders, long-range fiber-optic telecommunication, positron emission tomography, and particle physics.

==History==
The avalanche photodiode was invented by Japanese engineer Jun-ichi Nishizawa in 1952. However, study of avalanche breakdown, micro-plasma defects in silicon and germanium and the investigation of optical detection using p-n junctions predate this patent.

==Principle of operation==
Photodiodes generally operate by impact ionization, whereby a photon provides the energy to separate charge carriers in the semiconductor material into a positive and negative pair, which can thus cause a charge flow through the diode. By applying a high reverse bias voltage, any photoelectric effect in the diode can be multiplied by the avalanche effect. Thus, the APD can be thought of as applying a high gain effect to the induced photocurrent.

In general, the higher the reverse voltage, the higher the gain. A standard silicon APD typically can sustain 100–200 V of reverse bias before breakdown, leading to a gain factor of around 100. However, by employing alternative doping and bevelling (structural) techniques compared to traditional APDs, a it is possible to create designs where greater voltage can be applied (&gt; 1500 V) before breakdown is reached, and hence a greater operating gain (&gt; 1000) is achieved.

Among the various expressions for the APD multiplication factor (&quot;M&quot;), an instructive expression is given by the formula

:formula_1

where &quot;L&quot; is the space-charge boundary for electrons, and formula_2 is the multiplication coefficient for electrons (and holes). This coefficient has a strong dependence on the applied electric field strength, temperature, and doping profile. Since APD gain varies strongly with the applied reverse bias and temperature, it is necessary to closely monitor the reverse voltage to keep a stable gain.

===Geiger mode counting===

If very high gain is needed (105 to 106), detectors related to APDs called SPADs (single-photon avalanche diodes) can be used and operated with a reverse voltage above a typical APD&#x27;s breakdown voltage. In this case, the photodetector needs to have its signal current limited and quickly diminished. Active and passive current-quenching techniques have been used for this purpose. SPADs that operate in this high-gain regime are sometimes referred to being in Geiger mode. This mode is particularly useful for single-photon detection, provided that the dark count event rate and afterpulsing probability are sufficiently low.

==Materials==
In principle, any semiconductor material can be used as a multiplication region:
* Silicon will detect in the visible and near infrared, with low multiplication noise (excess noise).
* Germanium (Ge) will detect infrared out to a wavelength of 1.7 μm, but has high multiplication noise.
* InGaAs will detect out to longer than 1.6 μm and has less multiplication noise than Ge. It is normally used as the absorption region of a heterostructure diode, most typically involving InP as a substrate and as a multiplication layer. This material system is compatible with an absorption window of roughly 0.9–1.7 μm. InGaAs exhibits a high absorption coefficient at the wavelengths appropriate to high-speed telecommunications using optical fibers, so only a few micrometres of InGaAs are required for nearly 100% light absorption. The excess noise factor is low enough to permit a gain-bandwidth product in excess of 100 GHz for a simple InP/InGaAs system, and up to 400 GHz for InGaAs on silicon. Therefore, high-speed operation is possible: commercial devices are available to speeds of at least 10 Gbit/s.
* Gallium-nitride–based diodes have been used for operation with ultraviolet light.
* HgCdTe-based diodes operate in the infrared, typically at wavelengths up to about 14 μm, but require cooling to reduce dark currents. Very low excess noise can be achieved in this material system.

===Structure===

APDs are often not constructed as simple p-n junctions but have more complex designs such as p+-i-p-n+.

==Performance limits==
APD applicability and usefulness depends on many parameters. Two of the larger factors are: quantum efficiency, which indicates how well incident optical photons are absorbed and then used to generate primary charge carriers; and total leakage current, which is the sum of the dark current, photocurrent and noise. Electronic dark-noise components are series and parallel noise. Series noise, which is the effect of shot noise, is basically proportional to the APD capacitance, while the parallel noise is associated with the fluctuations of the APD bulk and surface dark currents.

===Gain noise, excess noise factor===
Another noise source is the excess noise factor, ENF. It is a multiplicative correction applied to the noise that describes the increase in the statistical noise, specifically Poisson noise, due to the multiplication process. The ENF is defined for any device, such as photomultiplier tubes, silicon solid-state photomultipliers, and APDs, that multiplies a signal, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;gain noise&quot;. At a gain &quot;M&quot;, it is denoted by ENF(&quot;M&quot;) and can often be expressed as

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the ratio of the hole impact ionization rate to that of electrons. For an electron multiplication device it is given by the hole impact ionization rate divided by the electron impact ionization rate. It is desirable to have a large asymmetry between these rates to minimize ENF(&quot;M&quot;), since ENF(&quot;M&quot;) is one of the main factors that limit, among other things, the best possible energy resolution obtainable.

===Conversion noise, Fano factor===

The noise term for an APD may also contain a Fano factor, which is a multiplicative correction applied to the Poisson noise associated with the conversion of the energy deposited by a charged particle to the electron-hole pairs, which is the signal before multiplication. The correction factor describes the decrease in the noise, relative to Poisson statistics, due to the uniformity of conversion process and the absence of, or weak coupling to, bath states in the conversion process. In other words, an &quot;ideal&quot; semiconductor would convert the energy of the charged particle into an exact and reproducible number of electron hole pairs to conserve energy; in reality, however, the energy deposited by the charged particle is divided into the generation of electron hole pairs, the generation of sound, the generation of heat, and the generation of damage or displacement. The existence of these other channels introduces a stochastic process, where the amount of energy deposited into any single process varies from event to event, even if the amount of energy deposited is the same.

===Further influences===

The underlying physics associated with the excess noise factor (gain noise) and the Fano factor (conversion noise) is very different. However, the application of these factors as multiplicative corrections to the expected Poisson noise is similar. In addition to excess noise, there are limits to device performance associated with the capacitance, transit times and avalanche multiplication time. The capacitance increases with increasing device area and decreasing thickness. The transit times (both electrons and holes) increase with increasing thickness, implying a tradeoff between capacitance and transit time for performance. The avalanche multiplication time times the gain is given to first order by the gain-bandwidth product, which is a function of the device structure and most especially formula_5.
